<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alone in his new bedroom and with the pressure in his chest gone, Rebecca felt a little drained. He tried to get dressed, but his panties wouldn&#39;t fit right: his cock was still hard and poking out through the top. Worse, his bra was still damp on the inside. Even his phone had gotten milk on it, but it seemed okay.<br />
<br />
He checked the two dressers in the room, only to find them mostly empty. There were a few outfits identical to the one he&#39;d been wearing, but not much else. He took the bra and shirt from one set and put them on, but left the shorts and underwear. &quot;Whatever. Clothing&#39;s optional anyway, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess knocked on the door a few minutes later, and Rebecca opened it only to find Jess pushing a cart loaded with salad bowls, more than he could ever possibly eat. &quot;How do you like your salad? Grated cheese? Dressing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grated cheese on a salad. That was a rarity these days. Even with the Regeneration Act in full swing, dairy products were still significantly more expensive than they&#39;d been in the past. &quot;Both. Do you have balsamic vinaigrette?&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a bowl off the cart, and then took out the largest block of cheese Rebecca had ever seen. It must&#39;ve weighed two or three pounds, and looked real, not like the heavily processed stuff the grocery stores sold. It fell like snow onto the top of the salad, which she then coated in dressing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule one of life on the farm,&quot; she said, handing him the bowl, &quot;eat until you&#39;re full, then eat some more. You&#39;re changing, and you&#39;ll need all the energy you can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca ate a mouthful, and only then did he realize how hungry he was. He devoured the first bowl, and Jess handed him a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule two, never let your breasts get too full. It can ruin your supply if you don&#39;t pump frequently enough. The second you start feeling full, pump. Save your milk and put it in the blue fridge downstairs, in the bin with your name on it. We can sell the milk and you get paid for it on top of your regular Regeneration Program paycheck. I put the bottles you just pumped in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought that in a few weeks, people would probably be filling their cereal bowls with his milk was strangely satisfying to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule three, clothing is optional. I think you&#39;ve already figured that one out. Wear as much or as little as you want, and let me know when yours don&#39;t fit anymore. As long as you&#39;re part of the program, we clothe you for free. If you want, once you&#39;re done with your changes, we can get you measured so you can buy your own, if you&#39;d prefer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca finished his second bowl of salad and plowed through a third. His stomach felt bottomless, like he could eat all day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule four, always take care of your sexual urges. You&#39;re a cow now, so you can do what comes naturally whenever you feel you need to. In public, in private, doesn&#39;t matter. Only rule is it has to be consensual, but you shouldn&#39;t have any problem with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was the only thing he still felt apprehensive about. Jacking off? In public? Sure, that one girl had dropped her shorts and laid her eggs outside the bus, but he couldn&#39;t see himself doing that. He kept eating, trying not to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a whole set of toys in the bathroom. Use them, but make sure you clean them off. Laundry goes in a basket in the closet, it&#39;s collected once a day. If you need food, there&#39;s a kitchen downstairs that we keep stocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time Rebecca was done eating, there were seven empty bowls next to him, and an eighth in front of him with nothing but scraps left. Jess seemed to be noting his progress.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. what is there to do around here? I mean, besides eating and getting milked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a bus that goes into town every couple of hours. You can go shopping, catch a movie if you&#39;d like, go out to eat.. pretty much anything you&#39;d like. The only real limit is your milk cycle. Once you&#39;re fully grown, we&#39;re the only place for miles that has the equipment to handle the amount of milk you&#39;ll be producing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a gym anywhere? I mean, do cows get.. am I gonna gain a bunch of weight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got a gym on the farm, sure. We usually ask the cows not to lift weights, but cardio should be fine. You&#39;ll get heavier, but that&#39;s normal for a cow and a lot of that&#39;s going to be milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca yawned. &quot;I&#39;m.. feeling kinda tired. Mind if I take a nap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be your hormones shifting over. It&#39;ll be like that for a few days while your body adjusts. I&#39;ll clean up, go on ahead and sleep. Your bags will be outside the door by the time you wake up. If you need anything else, just let me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca didn&#39;t even bother to take his shirt off before crawling into the bed, pulling up the sheets as Jess cleared out and pulling them back down once she left. He was tired, but somewhere in between bowls of salad he&#39;d realized how horny he was. One hand ventured between his legs, but some strange instinct caused his other hand to go up to his nipples, rubbing and massaging them underneath his bra. They felt almost as good as his cock did, each motion of his fingers sending sparks of pleasure down his spine. After a few minutes, he gave up on his cock entirely and had both hands on his chest, rubbing and rubbing until..<br />
<br />
His cock spurted all over his stomach. Then it happened again, the sensations so strong that they were starting to hurt. A third spurt, and then his cock fell over, continuing to leak. He got to the bathroom just in time and wiped himself off, still feeling echoes of pleasure in his butt where his prostate was continuing to pulse. Rebecca turned the shower on and jumped in, noticing that he was still oozing cum. Then, after a few minutes under the hot water, it dried up. It was the longest orgasm he&#39;d ever had, and the most cum he&#39;d ever shot by far. <br />
<br />
&quot;I barely even touched it,&quot; he whispered. Was this it? Was he actually starting to change?<br />
<br />
Rebecca cleaned up in the shower, dried off, and went back to bed. This time, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
