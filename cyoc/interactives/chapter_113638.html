<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group slowly gathered around the lone laptop that had been setup as part of the recording of the Animalia Ambassadoria episode. Many times they didn&#39;t always have time to sit and monitor the responses to the broadcasts, as Abby still had her work on the farm and was also still training for the IAC next summer and all of them had their standard homework to do, but for the moment there was some curiosity over how people would respond to the latest episode. Simon&#39;s presence at the gym was an added part, since it gave Malice the opportunity to  hang out with him. He was likely there to keep in shape for either entrance into the state&#39;s police academy after high school and found himself pleasantly surprised by Animalia&#39;s ambassadors running their broadcast.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... I&#39;ve never actually gotten to see your shows before,&quot; Simon said to Malice, &quot;It was kinda neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You hadn&#39;t?&quot; Malice asked.<br />
<br />
The others glanced to him for a moment, as they were all clearly surprised by the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... my family&#39;s really only just been me and my mom,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;and financially we haven&#39;t been that well off. We don&#39;t have a computer or the internet, so it isn&#39;t like I could see the webcast unless I was at my uncle&#39;s or school... and there, that would then depend on it being a free period.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Malice and Sarah both said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;we&#39;ve got by and now that Project Phoenix got me through my diabetes and all that... no more insulin shots, no more needles, nor more costly doctor visits... and hello good health. So things should get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice and Sarah both nodded. They were both curious, but they didn&#39;t want to pry in on Simon&#39;s family&#39;s financial situation. Sarah also remembered something from a few years ago when a police officer had been killed when hit by a car that had lost control on an icy road during the winter. At that time, Sarah didn&#39;t pay much attention, though now, Sarah realized that that officer was probably Simon&#39;s uncle. Still, Simon&#39;s family&#39;s finances weren&#39;t their business and it&#39;d be rude to pry, and for Malice, with her history as a pet, money wasn&#39;t that much of a concern for her. She could grasp somethings about human economics, but more often than not money wasn&#39;t something she was looking for in life. She looked to Simon with his more golden wolf eyes and knew exactly what she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they will,&quot; Jessica said after a few moments, &quot;and I think we&#39;re starting to get some comments in.<br />
<br />
They all moved to crowd around her to see what came in. The computer was fairly standard and usually Sophie or Jessica handled the operation of the computer to get things ready, as it wasn&#39;t one of the specialized ones that Abby needed to fit her much larger fingers and more &quot;hoof-like&quot; nails. As they gathered around they could see that the first comments had come in, though one soon raised a face palm from all of them.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;I actually like the way Animalians look and dress, especially their ladies. They all have a perfect hourglass figure with a D cup MINIMUM chest... and many of them are so well muscled that even with that body they&#39;d make for great athletes. It&#39;s like the perfect combination... And one I&#39;d love to get close to if you know what I mean. - NizeGuy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some humans think we&#39;re too sexual and others want to have sex with us,&quot; Abby gave a groan and rubbed her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing,&quot; Malice commented, &quot;Those guys like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point,&quot; Abby answered, &quot;It&#39;s like many of the boys here that made senseless passes at me when I first came to school as an Animalian. They see the outline of my breasts under my shirt and the width of my hips and the only thing they think of is trying to get in my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is sort of the point,&quot; Sophie commented to Abby, &quot;I mean, you, Sarah, and Malice as double dosers epitomize everything that humanity has long held as sexy. People are bound to be attracted to to you in that way. Shoot... even Jessica as a single doser is bigger than she was before she became a rabbit. She&#39;s going to grow into the same body type that all adult/double dosed Animalians have. That&#39;s going make men want you... and on some level will make some women want to be you. That&#39;s something you can&#39;t get away from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to join?&quot; Abby asked, catching on to something Sophie said in that.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;m fine as I am,&quot; Sophie answered, though she thought silently to herself, &quot;For now... Maybe I&#39;ll join later in life... or if an Animalian finds himself romantically interested in me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d agree with Malice,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;it sounds gross... but the guys that like us aren&#39;t the ones to really worry about. Especially as more people have either had accidents that got us transformed, Abby, or as others became Animalians when it was legally allowed... the WORST of the perverted actions seemed to go down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby only shrugged, while Jessica scrolled down the screen to look through some of the comments. There were a few of the same old negative comments from guys like &quot; ih8Ulibs&quot; which were random and even unrelated to the actual episode. One made the commentary that predatory Animalians like Orcas, Wolves, Foxes, Lions, Tigers, and others would prey on Humanity when given the chance, ignoring the fact that many of their earlier episodes had discussed the Ten Edicts that directly prohibited that and that the human population in Lyre hadn&#39;t been decimated by roaming uplifted predators.<br />
<br />
&quot;The troll remains dumb,&quot; Sophie commented at that, &quot;almost makes me wish I knew who he was. For a guy who hates you so much, you&#39;d think he&#39;d just go away and leave you alone eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably nothing better to do,&quot; Sarah commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he actually WANTS to be an Animalian, but hasn&#39;t gotten the opportunity...&quot; Simon spoke up, &quot;you know, wanted to join Project Phoenix but was rejected or something like that. His hatred is because someone said he couldn&#39;t have it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be weird,&quot; Malice commented, not really believing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m right,&quot; Simon admitted, &quot;Just that it&#39;s a theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And one we&#39;ll never figure out, since all we have is his username,&quot; Sophie pointed out, and scrolled down.<br />
<br />
Eventually she came to one that related to the episode and seemed fairly effective. It read: &quot;I&#39;d never thought of the issue with regard to body heat. I mean, I&#39;ve never had that sort of trouble with regard to keeping warm or staying cool... and much of my protests were based on that. After all, if Animalians are just like Humans but with fur, that they&#39;d be just like me.  The screen showing the differences in body heat was something and an eye opener... Thank you for the information. - JenJen66.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s the one that Clara said made the comment about the minimum amount of skin we should show,&quot; Jessica commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically for most of us the only &quot;skin&quot; we show is our noses,&quot; Malice commented and nuzzled her nose to Simon&#39;s who gave a small smile and nuzzled her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not what she meant by the original comment,&quot; Jessica pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but it DOES seem like she was paying attention,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;which is a sign of improvement.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded at that.</p>
