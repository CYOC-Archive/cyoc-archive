<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Mark moved out into the hall he clearly heard that Geoff had a small party within his flat, at least he knows from Aidans memories that Geoff didn´t has his music that loud normally. Adding to that was his invitation of Aidan Mark also had known from said memories. That gave him an idea, so he quickly scanned who was actual in Geoffs flat at the moment. It came up with six names and profiles, all in separate windows on the screen.<br />
First was Geoff Carter, the owner of the flat and interested in computers. Second came Daniel Brown with the same interests and classes as Geoff. The third one was Jeremy Smith, with was one of Aidans classmates in art. Next came the brothers Jack and John Evans with were both in sport classes. And last but not least was Mitch Jones, taking classes for engineering. <br />
&quot;An interesting group&quot; Mark thought. He had known everyone of them but Jeremy beforehand and Aidans memories added some points. Therefore he knows that Jack, the older brother could be an ass to everyone he didn´t like and his brother John was highly influenced by him. Mitch was always stuck-up with everyone but his friends. Daniel and Geoff were much alike and were troublemakers, but nothing got out off hand by them, so they weren´t punished mostly. From Aidan he knows that Jeremy is a quiet student eager to learn.<br />
Mark already had an idea what he would do with them. Turning to the stroller he asked: &quot;Do you want a playmate Aidan?&quot;<br />
Aidan couldn´t believe it, Mark wanted to do this changes to another person? And most likely to Geoff, one of his friends? He just shook his head clearly meaning no.<br />
But Mark had already decided to give Aidan a playmate the same age he was. So he first changed the stroller into one with two seats next to each other. The stroller split its front-wheel in two, moving one together with the seat Aidan occupied to the right side while on the left grew a copy of said seat with the second front-wheel in the middle. On Marks side it didn´t change much, it only grew slightly in width. It would still pass through a door, even when it would be narrow.<br />
<br />
Mark then opened the text input on all six profiles and added what he had at the very beginning to Aidan, &quot;Mark rules&quot;, into them and saved it. Now he would have complete control over the group in the flat. Now he just had to decide who he should change how.<br />
<br />
Mark then pushed the stroller to the door of Geoffs flat, ringing the bell. Shortly after Geoff opened the door, looking at the duo in wonder. &quot;Hi, what do you want?&quot; He had known Mark only through Aidan and with him no longer a student didn´t remember ever meeting him. Maybe seen him between classes, but nothing sure.<br />
Aidan looked up at Geoff shocked. Okay, he was changed into a baby, but he had hoped that he was still recognizable. He had forgotten that reality had been altered so that he had never existed in an older version. But he mentally screamed at him: &quot;Geoff, close that door before Mark does anything to you.&quot;<br />
Mark grinned a bit at Aidans mental outburst before responding to Geoff: &quot;Well, I´m here to get little Aidans playmate. Would you let me in so I can look for him?&quot;<br />
While Aidan believed that Geoff would just laugh because there was clearly nobody around his bodies age around he was shocked even more when he moved aside. &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
While Mark pushed the stroller in Geoff himself wondered why he let that man in so easily without knowing him or this baby. &quot;Then again, who are you? And who is the playmate you speak of? We haven´t a baby here.&quot;<br />
The other five were seated in the room, all looking at Mark and Aidan in question. Some had known Mark without Aidan like the brothers and Mitch. <br />
Mark grinned when he looked at Geoff to answer his question: &quot;I´m Mark Romano and this little guy here is Aidan, my adopted little brother. But you have known him before he became a baby again, only you don´t remember him. He was also your neighbor before. But you all can remember him, don´t you?&quot;<br />
Aidan could see a look of recognition in Geoffs eyes and supposed that the other did the same. That was the moment he realized why Geoff had let them in so easily. &quot;Mark, you didn´t give yourself the ability to &quot;rule&quot; them around like you did with me, did you? You ....&quot; And that was the first time Aidan noticed that something was amiss with him. He clearly wanted to insult Mark but didn´t know a word to say or think to do so. If he could he would throw even more insults at Mark now, but couldn´t.<br />
Meanwhile the look on Geoffs face changed from recognition to shock. &quot;What have you done with Aidan, you asshole?&quot; He then moved to hit Mark, but was stopped by a simple &quot;Don´t move, all of you.&quot; The others had all gotten up but froze in position. Aidan happily accepted the insult for Mark and tried to use it himself only to notice that he had already forgotten what Geoff said to insult Mark. That let him cry mentally while his body giggled and calmly sucked on his pacifier, with just disgusted Aidan more. &quot;That taste... If I ever get you for this Mark I will kick you to the moon.&quot; At least he could still threaten him, even if at the moment it was an empty threat.<br />
&quot;Why can´t I move?&quot; asked John irritated and angry at Mark. <br />
&quot;You are all in the same position as Aidan was when I got here today, only now I know more about it. With Aidan I accidentally took control with his chronivac by writing &quot;Mark rules&quot; in his profile. I did the same with you before I ringed the bell. I have you all under my control and can do what I want with you. You have seen this when Geoff let me in and when you all have remembered Aidan who in that form no longer existed. All I say can turn real for you. Someone stops the music.&quot; Mark explained while laughing at their faces.<br />
They all tried to move but could do nothing. Only John moved, but not on his own. He switched the music off before returning to his old position next to his brother. &quot;So you just used some program to change Aidan back into a baby? And now you think you can do the same to us?&quot; summarized Daniel worried. He didn´t want to end as a baby too.<br />
&quot;No. Only one of you will join Aidans fate as a baby. But I have an idea what to do about the rest. And if I hadn´t I could just go and let you forget I was ever here and the ones I have changed completely. It would be as if they never existed in their old form like Aidan. You could ask his uncle who had rented the flat to him. He would say he didn´t has an nephew. And that the flat isn´t rented.&quot; Mark said still laughing in between. He liked that feeling of power over others.<br />
None of the six frozen young man was calm with that statement. Nobody wanted to be a baby like Aidan, sharing his fate, whatever that included beside being regressed. But they all had no idea if whatever Mark had in mind for them was any better.<br />
Aidan was still screaming threats mentally at Mark to let them be, but that went on deaf ears on Mark, not that Aidan would know that Mark heard him clearly if he wanted to.</p>
