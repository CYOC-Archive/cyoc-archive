<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He hated this. He hated being taught to walk like a girl, to talk like a girl and to be called by a girl's name. But as Tanya taught him in the couple hours they had until the party, Calvin allowed himself to called Sandy and treated like a girl, the silent promise that he'd made himself burning within. Mentally smiling, he contemplated whether taking Tanya and teaching her place sometime after the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good,&quot; Tanya announced, disrupting his thoughts and when he turned to where she was sitting next to him, she said, &quot;Now let's practice talking,&quot; and than she began coaching him in speaking and sounding like a girl.<br />
<br />
As he followed her directions and listened as she praised him on what a fast learner he was, Calvin scornfully thought about how great it would be to go slowly at her, warping her, teaching her and than leaving her, as he'd done in the past with five other girls, all broken and totally dependent on the superior sex. &quot;As it should be,&quot; Calvin thought as he felt and heard his voice shift in pitch, becoming lighter and more feminine.<br />
<br />
When Tanya decided he was doing fine, she stood and told him, &quot;Keep at it. Practice not only speaking, but also walking and acting. In the meantime, I'm going to get ready,&quot; and exiting the living room, she left Calvin sitting on the couch.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the light blue, almost white, dress and how it hugged his body, giving him the appearance of a girl, Calvin sighed and stood. As he started to walk back and forth, he uttered various words, finding that his stance, walk and the pitch of his voice was becoming more and more feminine as he went along. When he finally paused, he realised that once again the feeling of normalcy had come over him and for some reason he felt comfortable, almost as if he did this sort of thing day-to-day; talked like a girl, walked one, acted like one and generally was actually a girl.<br />
<br />
Scared, he sat down on the couch and without really giving it a second thought, he crossed his lower legs together and staring idly down at the ring he'd gotten from the carnival, pondered over whether there was something wrong with him. Glancing up, he decided it was nothing and that what was really going on was that it was all that Tanya was doing. Coming to that conclusion, Calvin smiled and thought of the enjoyment he would get when he put the girl in her place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; a voice asked and glancing up, realising it was Tanya, Calving stared for a moment at the dress she was wearing before finally the words, &quot;You look cute in that,&quot; escaped him.<br />
<br />
Unsure why he'd just told this girl she was cute, Calvin gracefully stood and followed Tanya as she headed toward the front door. Outside a small breeze caused the dress he was wearing to shift and brush against his exposed legs. As this happened, a sensation swept through Calvin and the best way he could describe it was the wanting and need to feel feminine, girly.<br />
<br />
Sure that he was loosing his mind, especially to what Tanya had helped created, he glanced at the girl and muttered, &quot;I feel kind of conspicuous. People are going to see me for who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, Sandy,&quot; Tanya replied as she locked the door to her apartment.<br />
<br />
Taking Calvin's hand, she soothed him by saying, &quot;You look pretty. And everyone who sees you will think the same. They shan't see anyone but a pretty, young woman,&quot; and leading him forward, they began to walk towards the nearby university.<br />
<br />
When they arrived on campus, Tanya led the way towards the fraternity and sorority houses and when she came to one that had a flag containing the Greek letters Chi Theta Upsilon printed on it, she marched up the front steps and knocked on the door. Immediately the door swung open and the sounds of a noisy party assaulted Calvin as a girl squealed, &quot;You made it,&quot; and than Calvin found himself being pulled in.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Sandy,&quot; Tanya said by way of introductions and as Calvin took the offered hand and lightly shook it, he listened as the girl that opened the door said, &quot;I'm Pamela. Nice to meet you. If you're thirsty there's alcohol or soda available in the kitchen, as well as food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muttering, &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Calvin stared at all the girls around him, thinking of the potential of what he could teach them.<br />
<br />
Than he remembered what he was wearing and suddenly became self-conscious that one of the girls would spot him for what he was. Next to him, Pamela and Tanya were talking and during their conversation, Calvin caught that Pamela was the chapter president of the sorority and that Tanya was telling her, at one point, not to mind Sandy because she was kind of shy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it takes all kinds,&quot; Pamela announced as a group of girls approached and looking fully at Calvin, she said, &quot;If you ever consider going to college here, consider joining us,&quot; and spying the approaching girls, she added, &quot;This here is Cynthia, Teresa and Melisa. Teresa is our vice-president and attending college on a sports scholarship that pays for her tuition, providing she keeps her grades up, for four years. Teresa is attending, courtesy of the military and her uncle, a three star general,&quot; pointing to the each girl as she explained.<br />
<br />
Nodding at each as they were introduced, Calvin felt the feeling of normalcy slipping over him as he told each, &quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
A knocking on the door brought an end to any more conversations and as Pamela said, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and went to answer the door, Tanya gently pulled on Calvin's hand and announced over the noise, &quot;Come on. Let's go get something to drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing over at Teresa, Melisa and Cynthia, noting that they were already heading for what appeared to be a crowded living room, Calvin allowed himself to be led to the back of the house. There, he snagged himself a wine cooler and as he drank it, he calmly looked around. Next to him, Tanya quaffed a plastic cup of beer and gently poking him, she said, &quot;Try to relax and just remember what I taught you,&quot; and moving away, she disappeared into the party.<br />
<br />
As he finished the wine cooler, and grabbed another, Calvin wished he could just disappear. Knowing that he couldn't get drunk on wine coolers, he finished his second and grabbed a third. Moving through the kitchen, listening to the techno-pop music playing, Calvin found himself relaxing a bit and when a girl approached and engaged him in conversation, he quickly began to talk to her. As he did so, he slowly began to forget about why he really came to the party and when the girl squealed, &quot;Oh my god,&quot; he looked around in alarm for a moment, but than realised she was exclaiming about the two male dancers that had showed up.<br />
<br />
Not really wanting to be in the same room as a couple of male strippers, Calvin tried to excuse himself, but instead found a cup of beer thrust into his hand as the room he was in filled up more and more. Glancing at the man dressed as a cop and the other dressed as a fireman, Calvin found himself suddenly riveted as the two started to bump and grind to the music. Quickly drinking the cup of beer without thinking about what he was doing, he attempted to excuse himself from the room.<br />
<br />
Instead, he once again found another cup of beer thrust at him and this time he was pushed forward to the edge of the crowd. Without really thinking about what he was doing, Calvin let out a noise that sounded something between a girl's squeal of pleasure and the words, &quot;Woo hoo,&quot; as he began to slowly drink.<br />
<br />
When the male dancer that had been dressed as a cop approached him, Calvin quickly finished his drink. As the man, wearing nothing but a tie and a pair of skimpy underwear continued to bump and grind, Calvin stepped forward and began to rub himself against the man. A feeling of sexual excitement began to flood him and as he turned on the spot, forgetting completely that he was a boy dressed as a girl, he listened as the male dancer said, &quot;Young lady. You're under arrest for suspicions of being hot and sexy. I'm afraid I'm going to have to give you are a cavity search,&quot; and reaching down, he began to push on the hem of his underwear.<br />
<br />
As the other girls around him began to whistle, Calvin glanced down and for a moment, hesitated. But than he saw the man's erect penis, watched at the stripper slid a condom over it, and wanting to be taken by him, &quot;Calvin grinned and said, &quot;You can do whatever you want. I shan't be resisting arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile forms on the dancers face and slowly running his hands over Calvin's body, he rubs himself against Calvin. The feeling of sexual excitement growing, Calvin moans out as the dancer runs his hands up Calvin's legs and that started to remove the underwear Calvin was wearing. Realising suddenly what was happening, Calvin again hesitated as the stripper helped him step out of the underwear. And than he felt the man was spinning him around and bending him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm about to raped in the butt, by a guy,&quot; Calvin thought as he looked wildly about.<br />
<br />
Around him he could see the smiling and cheering faces of hundreds of girls, while behind him. He felt the male dancer's protected cock rubbing against him. Than, to Calvin's horror, as the amorous sensation he was feeling grew more and more, the male stripper thrust his penis into Calvin.<br />
<br />
Only Calvin suddenly realised that the man's cock wasn't in his anus, but was thrusting into the flesh between his male genitals and his butt. &quot;Almost as if I had a vagina opening,&quot; Calvin thought worriedly and tried to scream out in terror, but found that all he could do was a combination of a scream slash moan of pleasure. And than the other male dancer was behind, also wearing a condom over his penis, commenting, &quot;Let me put out that fire,&quot; as Calvin found himself enjoying himself and scanning the crowd, not seeing Tanya anywhere, but wanting to be a hasty exit.</p>
