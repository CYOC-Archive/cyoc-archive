<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken sat back in his chair knowing he should not be playing games, he just didn't have the time. Yet too, he had been hard at work a long time and many days without a distraction.<br />
<br />
Closing one's eyes Ken thought of a desired form which to this time was never possible. Reaching back to when a child he thought of a girl he loved deeply. Even as a child the feelings of love for another ran deep and Ken still loved thinking of his time with her at play.<br />
<br />
It was that terrible day when his father announced that the family was moving to a new house, and Ken would lose his friends and girl forever. Sitting in an apple tree Ken told her of his father's plans. They cried together and wished that they could stay together. Ken asked her if she was of different form form them to stay together in this cold world just where she would wish them to become.<br />
<br />
Looking about from their treehouse built in an old apple tree she smiled and pointed to Mister Black's small zoo nearby. A group of pens built next to a small barn Mr. Black kept his pets which were near to his heart. A group of wild game birds, a Peacock, two goats, three dogs, and a very lonely gelded pony. She pointed to the pony and suggested she would prefer to be a soft fuzzy pony, if it were possible.<br />
<br />
All this happened over fourty years ago but Ken remember it and carried the loss of her friendship in his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I were to choose another form would I prefer that black pony who stood so often masterbating in his small pen?&quot; thought Ken. Looking around he set his eyes and imagination toward the large bookcase behind his desk.<br />
<br />
Books and books, most on transportation, some on travel while only one was of anything to do with the animal world. &quot;A Glossary on the World of Horses&quot; was the only choice available. Picking up the book he'd not looked at in a dozen years Ken began to browse the pages of color photos.<br />
<br />
Beautiful pictures of draft horses, their great muscles bulging. Then too pictures to equestrian horses, tall beasts 16 hands high with long flowing tails. Riding and pleasure horses of many many colors, some tall, some stout. A section on Ponies caught Ken's eye as he paged one type after another looking for one that might represent that black gelding he so remembered.<br />
<br />
Ah but nothing in the pony section really reminded him of that pony. The back section had a short grouping of wild horses and their cousins. This section too had nothing of speciality for Ken's memory.<br />
A section on horse management, then health, and lastly riding tack.<br />
<br />
Sitting back in his judges chair Ken closed his eyes as he closed the big book. &quot;Heck, nothing to make him reach out to his fond memory of that moment and her!&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Ken got up and walked to the kitchen for a cold glass of water. His work of building a business was enough agravation and now he had walked memory lane with about as little satisfaction. Standing alone in the house he looked at the clock and thought his dear wife would not be home from work for four more hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have to lose if the game was played about some horse? It was four hours before Joan would come home. NO, wait it was monday and the wifee worked till eight tonight. Eight hours I could play with the game, oh but what game would last that long? I'll try the dumb thing and after a while go back to the work I should be doing!&quot; Ken thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Walking down the hall he so sat at his computer desk and the big book laid closed in front of him. Ken didn't know what to chose, but what did it matter this was only a game. Peeking his finger nail between the closed pages, Ken flipped it open and dropped the book sight unseen to the scanner.<br />
<br />
Pressing the start key the scanner did it's work and the computer began to sputter. The second question asked for any betterments, for which Ken picked up the book, closing it and reopening in the Mamagement section. A picture of a stud doing his employment, showing the big cock in the air and about to plunge into the hobbled mare was next to be scanned. This Ken thought may assure the fact of male over the unknown picture of choice he had not yet seen.<br />
<br />
Next was the question of time. &quot;Hmm how long do I wish to tie up the computer?&quot; Ken pondered. Ken laid this to chance since it was only a dumb game. &quot;I was thirteen when we moved so I'll type in 13.&quot; as he did! Then closing his eyes he took the mouse and sliding it back and fouth he clicked it to whateven length of time might be of his luck. The computer whirled more and more.<br />
<br />
The fourth question as easy as Ken typed in the E-Mail address of his old gamester friend William. The final note waas to strip of all clothing till one was naked to the world, &quot;How odd!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken did as the game said but felt both cold and foolish as he sat in the big leather chair. Reaching his hand to the mouse he then clicked the yellow triangle and watched the show on his screen.</p>
