<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh… I think I picked the muscle card,” Jack flipped the card and showed it to his friends. It has the number 6 in bold in the middle with two large biceps flexing at the top and bottom of the card. It says that Jack must pick another player and lift them for 15 seconds. Succeed and they take a drink. Fail and they lose their muscles.<br />
<br />
“Do you even have muscles?” Mitch snarked. <br />
<br />
“You haven’t heard?” Jesse moved closer to Jack. “I saw him lifting in the gym the other day.”<br />
<br />
Jesse lifted Jack’s shirt. If one could look closely, one could see the faint sign of abdominal muscles. With his bulk somewhat evident, Marcus realized how Jack’s biceps bulked up a bit. A bit! He’s still the innocent little twink the group has come to know and love. But still, the added bulk helped in making him look a bit older. He’s always carded when they come to buy alcohol because of how young he looks. <br />
<br />
“It’s not much…” Jack blushed. <br />
<br />
“Heh-” Jesse chuckled. “We’ve been there too. Don’t be embarrassed. It may seem slow at the start but your bulk will ramp up. If you want, I could give you my regiment when I was about your size.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the offer but I already have my older brother helping me out. So, about the card.” Everyone’s eyes darted to the card on Jack’s hands. The answer is obvious. Although little, every gain Jack had these past few weeks is special to him. He doesn’t want to lose it. So, he chose the ten-year-old Mitch.<br />
<br />
“Why the hell are you picking me? Pick Marcus for goodness sake.” Mitch said.<br />
<br />
“Stop nagging and just hitch on Jack’s arms,” Marcus said.<br />
<br />
“Fine,”<br />
<br />
Jack crouched down and Mitch stepped on his arms. At first glance, it seems 15 seconds is way too fast for a simple task. But it seems Jack misjudged how a child should weigh. <br />
<br />
“I- I- think Mitch is getting a little heavy,” Jack grunted. The weights in the gym are far heavier than his friend but his lifting form is all wrong. And this weight is not as static. Mitch keeps squirming around, uncomfortable in his baggy clothes. And it feels embarrassing because one of Jack’s hands is cupping his butt while the other is wrapped around his armpits. It’s his tickle spot that disappeared when he grew up. But now that he’s a child, it is an unexpected welcome that made him squirm even further. “Mitch, please stop squirming.”<br />
<br />
“You’re tickling me!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, you are!”<br />
<br />
“Why are you screaming? I can hear you loud and clear.”<br />
<br />
Mitch doesn’t even know why he’s screaming. It’s just… his emotions. He’s annoyed and angry, and screaming is the only way to get these feelings out of his throat. It’s like he’s a child. Well, he is a child.<br />
<br />
Jack stepped back to regain a stable form, but his foot slipped. They came tumbling down the carpeted floor. Mitch landed with his butt.<br />
<br />
Jack shook off the dust from his eyes and looked at Jesse. “Did I get to 15 seconds?”<br />
<br />
Jack got the answer first from the frown on Jesse’s face. “You’re off by one and a quarter of a second.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Jack felt something tingling in his arms. He could see the skin stretching back, the muscle underneath deflated until all that was left was a smooth clean arm. The same sensation washed on his torso. His barely noticeable abdominals flattened until they were seen no more. <br />
<br />
A similar sensation happened to Mitch but for the opposite effect. Because of how he consumed the initial potion and since he is a child, the enlarging of his muscles is more pronounced. His arms coiled, his skin stretched, and valleys between muscle groups appeared. His bubbly abdomen hurt so much that he was squirming in pain amid his concerned friends. <br />
<br />
Jesse pushed him to the floor in a supine position. He unbuttoned Mitch’s shirt and saw the changes undergoing on his stomach. The skin bubbled and stretched. Six mounds of flesh appeared where his abdomen would be. His pectorals bounced and relinquished to a size apt for a ten-year-old child. He’s not as muscular as his original body, but he’s built for a ten-year-old. He’s built like a swimmer, with thin yet lean musculature.<br />
<br />
“Asshole!” Jack said. “I told you not to move around. You stole my muscles from me.” Jack slapped his abdomen and a hollow clap sounded back. The sweat and determination spent for those muscles are all for nothing. Jack jumped at Mitch and wrestled him on the floor. Even though Jack is the older guy, his punches came out weak against the now denser muscles of his friend.<br />
<br />
“I told you, you’re tickling me and that’s why I’m moving around. And you touched my butt!”<br />
<br />
“Where else should I touch you then? My hand is half the width of your body.”<br />
<br />
“Guys, relax.” Seeing the two fight is entertaining, but Jesse had to butt in. His drinking game is the reason why the two are fighting. “Mitch, if you can turn Jack to normal by your next turn. Do it.”<br />
<br />
“You’re just saying that because you don’t want me taking revenge after you turned me into a child,”<br />
<br />
In a way, Jesse had the thought in his mind. He’d be lying if he denied his claims. Jesse kept his mouth shut.<br />
<br />
With Jack’s turn done, it is now Marcus’ turn. With the event that has transpired so far, he’s excited to see what card he picks. </p>
