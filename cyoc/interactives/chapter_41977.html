<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three girls were getting ready for bed. Marry was excited that she was a magical semi-fox girl and made sure to let Jen and Allison know. Allison was hoping that she wouldn't have another dream about her parents being killed but she knew that it was likely and this made her sad. Jen was already planning how she would transform another friend. She was thinking that the next one she should transform would be Harry. He liked surprises and she was certain he wouldn't mind being a magical girl. His only friends seemed to girls.<br />
<br />
Just as Allison had finished pulling on her nightgown there was a scream outside. All three girls rushed to the window to see what it was. What they saw made their blood run cold. There were what looked to be eleven werewolves down on the street surrounding a woman. The biggest one with glowing red eyes advanced on the woman and bit her on the shoulder. She let out a howl of pain. The big one let her go and she collapsed onto the ground where her transformation began.<br />
<br />
Odd creaks and cracks could be heard coming from the lady as her face pushed out into a muzzle. Her ears crawled up the side of her head becoming triangular as they topped her head. Her fingers elongated and her fingernails became wicked looking claws. Her body started to bulk up and she used her claws to tear all of her clothes off. Her feet lengthened and her toenails became wicked looking claws too. Her breasts shrank down until they were gone. All the while her body was becoming ripped with muscle. Her long red hair receded into her scalp while changing to jet black. Once it was short it spread down her body giving her a thick coat of fur. Her nose turned a lighter black. The lady's teeth sharpened into canine teeth. When she opened her eyes they glowed yellow for just a moment. She stood up on her toes and she looked at the big one. The big one put a hand on the side of her head and kissed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn't a full moon tonight&quot; Allison said in a confused tone.<br />
<br />
Arcturo had landed on her shoulder and said &quot;They're not true werewolves. They've been changed by demon magic. That big one is the source.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we're safe?&quot; Marry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't come into a home yet&quot; Slifer said.<br />
<br />
Another lady came up the street and the wolf creatures quickly surrounded her. &quot;Portal her out of there Arcturo!&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
Arcturo immediately took flight and vanished. A split second later he reappeared by the lady and landed on her shoulder. She was startled by this as was the big wolf creature. He paused for a moment and in that moment Arcturo and the lady disappeared. A split second later they appeared in Jen's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what h-happened?&quot; the lady asked clearly frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're safe for now&quot; Allison said. &quot;Arcturo portaled you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-those c-creatures a-are w-werewolves&quot; the lady said. &quot;T-they'll c-come i-in h-here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not real werewolves&quot; Slifer said and the lady jumped and shrieked. Slifer continued as if the lady hadn't done anything. &quot;They've been transformed using demon magic and thus they're bound by the Homestead Laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are Homestead Laws?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're what prevent demonic forces from entering a home&quot; Slifer explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they can't enter a house&quot; Marry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can't enter a home&quot; Slifer said emphasizing home. &quot;A home is someplace you have lived in for awhile and is infused with your aura.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you had just moved?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it isn't a home&quot; Slifer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah's family just moved&quot; Jen said. &quot;Their house is in that direction.&quot; She pointed in the direction that the wolves had gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't trained yet&quot; Slifer said evidently seeing where Jen's line of thought was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be twelve to three&quot; Arcturo said. &quot;Not very good odds even for experienced fighters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't just stand by while they transform people&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what are you girls talking about?&quot; the lady asked.<br />
<br />
Just then Charlene came in and upon seeing the lady asked &quot;What's going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arcturo portaled this lady away from some demonic wolves&quot; Allison said. &quot;Now we're going to go stop them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the demonic forces to the angels&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you sense where they are Arcturo?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&quot; Arcturo said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then get ready to portal us as we transform&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not fight demonic wolves!&quot; Charlene said sternly.<br />
<br />
The girls looked each other and made up their minds. They took their necklaces and Jen and Marry said &quot;Mystic Girl Power!&quot; while Allison said &quot;Mystic Power Activate!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen's fur receded into her body. Her feet shortened and her claws became finger and toenails. Her muzzle shortened until she had a human face again. Her pajama bottoms shortened and changed into the pink skirt of her costume. Her top became the pink top of her costume. Her pink gloves and boots appeared while a third tail popped out.<br />
<br />
Marry's ears crawled up the side of her head becoming fox ears. Her nightgown changed from light blue to green and became the top and skirt of her uniform. Her green boots and gloves appeared while two tails popped out.<br />
<br />
Allison's nightgown and panties disappeared and she was naked for a second until her yellow swimsuit style costume appeared. Her yellow gloves and boots appeared while her hair became platinum blond and her eyes changed to ice blue. Her wings grew from her back and her white panther tail popped out.<br />
<br />
The portal felt like stepping from one room to another. One moment they were in Jen's room and the next the were in front of the demonic wolves. Allison looked at them and said &quot;That's far enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
The big one came forward and said &quot;Such brave girls. You'll make excellent additions to my army.&quot; There was drool dripping from his muzzle as he came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shouldn't be here&quot; Marry said fear evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;People need us&quot; Jen said though there was fear evident in her voice too.<br />
<br />
The big demonic wolf said &quot;You'll lose that fear soon enough.&quot; With that he lunged.</p>
