<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Boar was about to point you towards the horses but before the brute could say a word, another Skaven spoke up in an authoritative and demanding voice. This one was heads and shoulders above the human sized ones you originally saw, with a thick musculature that would put Any body builder to shame. Covered in scares and clad in red ramshackled armor he looked like a veteran of innumerable battles. <br />
<br />
“I stormvermin Skral Rat-Fucker demand this slave-meat!” The boar grimaced and gestures for the giant rat to come closer. They seem to get into a heated debate, but you are to far gone to care. You attention is fully focused on the warriors junk.<br />
<br />
While all the beastmen’s genitals were larger than any you seen before, there was something special about his. The birth of his gonads were about the size of your head and they were completely covered in the thickest fur-pubic hairs you have ever say. The acred masculine sent of them even cut through the musky air of all of the surrounding beasts. Your mouth instantly drooled and nothing else mattered. His cock was nothing to scooff about either. Ty reasoned it was wider than his pelvic opening and at least a foot and a half long. <br />
<br />
Ty snapped out of the trance when his muse with a cocky grin put a chain around his neck and started to roughly lead him away from the noticeably peeved boar.  “Where are we going” Ty said in a haze.<br />
<br />
Skal sharply snapped “shut up man-thing, not until we are in private-alone.”<br />
<br />
Ty felt compelled to comply by some oppressive force and the two entered a blood red portal.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Ty felt like he just woke up, he was discombobulated and had no idea where he was. It took him a second to get his barrings, it seemed the aphrodisiac mist was no longer around and he had a clearer picture of things. He soon came to the realization that he was in a ramshackled room and the imposing stormvermon was directly in his face. Ty tried to jump back, but found he was chained to a pipe. He then wished to be transported home but nothing happened. He looked on with horror and asked the Rat “Are you going to eat me?”<br />
<br />
Skal gave out a surprisingly jovial, but still somewhat menacing ratty chuckle. “ No no vermin-slave, nothing so minor-petty. However, you have wronged me and you will need to pay.” <br />
<br />
Ty is caught aback by this not knowing how he ever spitted the large rat. <br />
<br />
Skal saw the humans dumbfounded expression, and chuckled some more. He took on a more human gate, squatting down on his hind legs and talking in a less chittering voice “ I was the leading expedition head of braking a hole to your dimension from Hell. The leaders of the Rat beasts saught to gain a new realm to leverage against the other races on the infernal plane. I was well and truly on my way to making a brake through, even had a hole big enough to let one or two Skaven in at a time, when SOME wackadoo wizard just brook a massive gate  open to the center of hell and it became a free for all.” The Rats Beaty eyes squint a bit at you and you feel kind of bad.<br />
<br />
Than you get defensive and say “serves you right for trying to invade my reality anyways”<br />
<br />
“Says the person who released a whole deamon horde on their world just to get his rock off” <br />
<br />
Ty kind of shuts his mouth as he releases that the rat was right, he really didn’t have a moral leg to stand up on. <br />
<br />
A few awkward moments of silence go on until Ty asks what was going to happen to him and why couldn’t his powers work.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you asked” Skal says with a clap of his paws and an exited tone. He springs up in a surprising agile manor for a creature of his bulk and starts to pace back and forwards like a Professor lecturering his class. “As you can wager he’ll, and Skaven society in particular are not exactly forgiving to failure and tend to be ajust a smidge petty. They demoted me from my once high and exalted position as warlord to a simple Stormvermon, I can’t even use the breeder slaves. So to reclaim my rightful position in society I need to garner territory in the realm you so rudely stole from me.” <br />
<br />
“And how are you planing to do that” Ty says<br />
<br />
Skal’s previously elated grin became even wider and more menacing. “Why, the same problem that got me into this whole mess is the one that going to get me out,... and then some” “I don’t like where this is going” says Ty wide eyed.<br />
“You see my pet, no one else knows why the portal opened besides me, and it just so happens that something or someone who can open a realm rift in seconds, where it usually takes years, is incredibly powerful, powerful enough to say, take over a planet? Those chains around you now are one of the few things that can contain such powerful Magics. I know you won’t willingly give me your power, but as long as I hold these chains which bind us together I can corrupt you until you willingly become my wife, or, if all else fails, our children will catapult me to master of Earth! Hahaha!<br />
<br />
The inhuman going of his eye made Ty know for certain this was no jest, but he futile struggled in his bindings to get free. <br />
<br />
 Skal starts to jack off his ponderous manhood into a bowl, completely filling it with only his musky and corrupt pre, he than starts to add various red rocks and unstable compounds to the mixture. Ty tries to object and curse to no avail.<br />
<br />
The egomaniacal rat slowly, almost painfully takes out a massive rusty needle and sucks up the whole concoction. He presses it into Ty’s skin as the boy hyperventilates, feeling the burning liquid transfuse within his body making him more intimately close with the dispicable rat than even sex would provide. Feeling as if Skal was talking to him from within his own body. It was revolting. Yet also it made Ty feel more alive than he ever did before. <br />
<br />
Taking two steps Skal crossed his arms and watched his work. The first thing that hit Ty was his increased head rate, it felt as if it was going a thousand miles per hour and he couldn’t believe that it hadn’t exploded. His temperature rose as his body elongated and lost mass rapidly. His hands became more paw like and his feet became the digitigrade paw-feet of his captor. White fur spread out all over his body, an elegant clean alibasto white which betrayed his own corruption. A long wip like pink tail grew from his hindquarters, waving back and forth with the overstimulation of his body. His human face cracked and reshaped into a pretty little muzzle. His limbs and torso, know no different from the rats he saw at the space market, began to become more slim and delicate, almost feminine, and he shrunk to the size of 5 foot even. His ligaments were almost elven in their daintiness, but his pelvis expanded to give him child-bearing hips and a heart shaped ass. <br />
<br />
“Your coming along beautifully my love, I must admit I prefer this slight visage to the hulking breeding machines back in the den...”<br />
<br />
Ty’s rodent face became increasingly feminine as well, with slight checks And jawlines which greatly contrasted Skal’s own chizzled and wild frame. Ty Morso felt what was happening between his legs; his genitals were becoming less aperant. His penis shrunk until it was a cute 2 inches long even in its hardend state and his balls diminished and clung tightly to his taint, like they had never even dropped yet. Skal comments “that punny worthless things will look so right again a real man’s package” as gently groped his own prodigious junk. Ty felt humiliated as a man but also stupidly turned on at being disparaged and talked down to. He loved and hated it.<br />
<br />
Lastly, and this was the only time Ty saw Skal surprised, a set of massive horns spring out of the girly-boys head. He was only aback for a second before saying “yes, yes, yes, my mate will be a great breeder and among the ranks of the grey seer’s, maybe I’ll accomplish more than just reclaim my title...”<br />
<br />
Ty”s changes finally come to an end and he lets out a feminine gasp.<br />
<br />
Skal snatches Ty up by the check and it’s back to business with him “I can’t decide weither to keep you humiliated  as the first male breeder which will allow me to show you in public since the council only dictated that lower ranked rats cannot use female breeders, or change you into a female and keep you hidden while I breed you full of rattlings...” these decisions are always the hardest.</p>
