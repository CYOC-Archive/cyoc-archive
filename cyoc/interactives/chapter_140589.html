<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the attendants entered,Chad and William looked up just in time for them to unveil the seaweed wraps that they would be using. A bin on the cart would be opened,the smell of seaweed dispersing throughout the room. It was a muggy but salty scent that made both Chad and William seem a bit uncomfortable. Before any could announce their displeasure, one of the attendants would forced them both together. Their faces met and we&#39;re pushes against one another, cocks pressing into each other&#39;s stomachs. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Chad said, trying to fight against the man forcing him against William.<br />
&quot;Lemme go!&quot; William squirmed around but to no avail. The man&#39;s strength was far too great despite his form. <br />
<br />
The other attendant would begin wrapping both men in the seaweed, large damp leaves slowly coiling around both of their forms. It started at their feet before slowly working their way up. They could feel the cold water soaking into their legs, conflicting against the warm sauna both were in now. Struggling proved useless as the seaweed that was covering their legs by that point wouldn&#39;t budge no matter how much they fought against it. The seaweed would continue being applied until it covered their entire body, head included. The attendants looked over their seaweed mummy proudly and set the timer inside for 3 hours before walking out. <br />
<br />
Inside of the wrap, Chad would be struggling alongside William to get out. Space was limited and it felt like he was be having his entire body smashed into William. &quot;C&#39;mon, William! Help me get out of here!&quot; He snapped at the fellow captive, who replied with, &quot;I&#39;m trying! This god damn seaweed won&#39;t even break! What&#39;s it made out of?&quot; The mummy would like motionless, sometimes wiggling as either boy would kick out to try and free themselves.<br />
<br />
20 minutes in, both occupants would had tired themselves out. Chad would look at William and just think about what they could do to free themselves. The heat was making it hard to focus, his own cock hardened as it would poke William&#39;s stomach. &quot;Fuck. We&#39;re stuck, aren&#39;t we?&quot; He asked, his partner giving a sullen nod. Something was bothering his feet though. They would sluggish and warm. Trying to wiggle his toes would make them move in a way that almost was like they were facing a different direction. <br />
<br />
40 minutes, Chad and William both were struggling to stay conscious. The smell of seaweed was thick but something made them feel so relaxed. &quot;This feels nice at least...&quot; William offered to Chad, who looked at him weakly. His eyes would shoot down to their chests before noticing how strange their penises were. It was almost like they had vanished yet he could still feel his. <br />
<br />
At the 1 hour mark, Chad would awake, having nodded off for a few minutes. He awoke to see his body and William&#39;s sticking together. Their skins would mush up like balled clay, sticky and viscous. He could feel everything. His chest, William&#39;s right arm...Their feet. The flesh continued to mix as Chad and William&#39;s heads would begin to forced themselves together, both experiencing the most painful migraine either had experienced. As their heads would merge together, eyesight would quadruple for a moment before their minds would begin to sync up. They could temporarily read each other&#39;s thoughts. Panicked worries, their love, and soon even their memories. That time Chad broke his arm in 5th grade, the feeling of William making out with his first crush. It was almost euphoric. Just as their heads became one, both boys would become unconscious. <br />
<br />
The body would begin to form under the seaweed wrap as time would become meaningless. Muscles would grow and solidify, giving the man underneath the body any jock would dream over. Muscles peaked the peach colored skin, every drop running down then cooling the warm exterior. Down below, both boy&#39;s cocks would have expanded from the man&#39;s front, a large and thick rod growing to 10 inches of circumsized fury. Testicles dropped below him, the size of grapefruits which would supply him with his new plentiful seed. <br />
<br />
Legs and feet would grow and become swollen with muscle and experience. This new man could outrun any member of the team, fuck better even. The thought caused the cock to twitch in hunger. His chest would rise and push against the seaweed, his arms following suit until he had a body builder&#39;s muscle definition. Wide pecs that were stronger than Chad or William had ever been. The growth spurt had made his cock now make a visible bulge in the wrap. The cool water made it feel nice. Every droplet running down making him even more horny.<br />
<br />
Up above, his head would merge into a combination of Chad and William&#39;s. It gained Chad&#39;s cute dimples and youthful, cocky grin but had William&#39;s eyes and hair color. He looked in his 20s, opening his new eyes to the seaweed prison. The man&#39;s mind would take a minute to get working again, but when it did, he would strain against the wrap. His manhood would year for attention and he was going to give it just that. He grunted, unable to move his hands below at their size. Instead, he would make due. Rubbing his cock into the wrap, the man let out a small moan as the warmth of the sauna fueled his libido. The head would allow some precum out and dribble onto his new legs. Hips thrashing and fucking the seaweed wrap, he would feel he was close, a warmth filling his gigantic cock. With a final thrust, the cock broke free from the prison and release hot, thick ropes of cum all over the walls and floor. The man took the opportunity to rise sharply, the slweakened wrap bursting completely as he let out a sharp moan. <br />
<br />
In the afterglow, the man would be able to think. The two people in his mind. Who were they? Who was he? The name Chad...no William...They bounced around endlessly as he finishing his orgasm and listened to the door open. Both attendants would come back in, gently fastening a large loincloth around him. The material felt nice against his sensitive glands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Calum.&quot; One attedant said, the muscular man standing at attention and looking at both attdendants. Callum. It was a nice name. It was his, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;We hoped you enjoyed your seaweed wrap, but it&#39;s time to move on.&quot;</p>
