<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phil had been feeling kind of odd by the time he was sent off to gym class, and as usual groaned at the thought of having to do the obligatory class. The jocks really loved it, getting to show off their bodies and workout even more, and the teacher, Grayson Malloy, was a former athlete here himself - apparently he busted his knee when he was playing college ball. The guy was a huge and muscular, handsome fellow, somewhat brutish looking but surprisingly not brutish acting. His blond hair was styled back in a crew cut, and his eyes were bright blue.<br />
<br />
Phil just couldn&#39;t help but feel out of place among Mr. Malloy and his crop of jocks, at least half of whom did not have their favorite teacher&#39;s mellow demeanor. But something seemed off today especially as Phil got dressed into his PE shirt and put the jacket and his street clothes into his locker. His PE shirt was tighter on his chest than usual, and his midriff was higher, making it look like he was wearing something more like a crop top. His shorts were tighter, and showed a derriere that was tighter and more toned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you been working out, funny guy?&quot; Phil turned and looked at Jackson, head jock at the school. Big, buff and handsome Jackson was nothing if not the picture of privilege. Light brown hair and slate grey eyes, Jackson had his pick most of the time of the school&#39;s girls...and there were rumors he liked fooling around occasionally with other jocks. Not that Phil paid much heed to those rumors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, working out...&quot; Phil pondered for a moment and grinned a little, &quot;You noticing me, big guy?&quot; Phil flexed an arm and was actually rather surprised when a 16 inch bicep showed on his arm, stretching his shirt sleeve. Woah.<br />
<br />
Jackson for his part did not seem to find that very funny, and stomped off, &quot;I-I...no, not at all. Just thought you were looking better than usual. Uhh, stop dyeing that fucking hair. You look ridiculous!&quot; Was he...blushing?<br />
<br />
Phil figured it was none of his business, even if the idea of Jackson, big muscular preppy Jackson, being into a guy like him potentially was funny as all hell to him. Phil headed out when he saw the rest of the students starting to leave as well.<br />
<br />
Malloy marched back and forth in front of the assembled students shortly after they left the locker room and headed out to the field. The weight room door was open on the side of the building, and Grayson stated, &quot;Today we&#39;re gonna be hitting the weights. I expect a healthy, good form circuit today from all of you. If you need a spot, call on me or one of your fellow students. Macho posturing isn&#39;t worth a trip to the nurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone started chattering a bit about the nurse and how hot she was; &quot;Can you believe we get such a hot nurse?&quot; &quot;I swear she&#39;s right out of the footage of a porno...&quot; &quot;Yeah, I wanna get with her...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Grayson ordered some warm ups to get done, Phil gulped at the thought of doing push ups, and before long dropped and started going...and found that he was going longer, stronger than usual. His hair was streaked with some sweat, but he was not feeling even the least bit tired as he passed 40 push ups, when usually he could barely do 15. Phil found himself laughing under his breath, and by the time the warm up exercise ended, he pushed back on to his glutes and chuckled, &quot;...Feel so strong today...it&#39;s like, so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Phil ran a hand through his green dyed hair and looked around. Some people were staring at him, and he responded to this by flexing an arm...<br />
<br />
...An act that got the attention of Grayson. The gym teacher smirked a little and said, &quot;Well, if you&#39;re feeling so confident today, Philipe, you can show the class proper deadlift form when we head into the gym. You up for that, tough guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, show off and you get chosen to show how to do one of the toughest, most challenging full body exercises in the whole of the circuit. Phil guessed that was just his luck. He slowly nodded, sighing under his breath, &quot;Well, after all that preening I don&#39;t have much choice in the matter. Now...what in the world&#39;s a deadlift?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Malloy brought the class into the weight room, Phil saw what a deadlift was as the teacher brought him forward and pulled forward a huge weight bar, followed by racking a large 45 pound plate on each side, followed by a single 10 lbs weight on each side. Phil commented on seeing that, &quot;Ohh boy...ohh boy, every single way I can imagine handling that is not fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
Grayson said, &quot;I&#39;ll give you a demo three times, and then I want you to replicate it.&quot; Grayson stepped forward and did some light stretching before sticking out his rear, standing feet shoulder width apart, and gripping at two specific points on the weight bar. He breathed a few times, adjusting his grip...and then hoisted the whole weight up and down, hips thrusting forward and then back out each of the three times.<br />
<br />
Once he was done with the demo, Grayson asked, &quot;Think you can handle this weight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...certainly give it a try.&quot; For whatever reason, Phil was feeling like he had to at least use the same weight that Grayson used. The guy was so jacked, and all of a sudden the idea of using the same weight such a huge guy just used so easily was all Phil could think of. As he got in there and found himself adeptly imitating Grayson&#39;s stance, the students watched, enrapt.<br />
<br />
Phil breathed and looked left and right from his position. Feet shoulder width apart, pointing outward, butt pointing out, light bend in the knees, grip the bar at those smooth points...Phil grit his teeth and then begun. And what he thought would be a hellishly difficult task for his poor little chicken legs was incredibly easy. Phil found himself lifting the whole weight all the way to the top, and then slowly lowering it back down.<br />
<br />
Feeling his confidence soaring, Phil kept going. &quot;1...2...3...4...5...&quot; Phil&#39;s brow was slick with sweat as he hammered out rep after rep, his whole body feeling like it was burning from the exertion of the exercise. His manhood, embarrassingly enough, erected hard in his shorts from the feeling of fire in his glutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey Phil...that&#39;s good man, you showed how it&#39;s done. It&#39;s---you&#39;re all good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;15! 16! 17! 18---&quot; Phil barely even heard Grayson and only dropped the weight when he got to 20. And was then immediately confused by what came over him making go the distance and do that. &quot;Oh uh...yeah, sorry about that. Sorry guys I uh---&quot; He flushed when he looked down at himself, and heard some of the chatter about his state.<br />
<br />
Grayson stepped forward and clapped Phil&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You did really good, excellent even. I didn&#39;t expect you to go that far on deadlifts. Legs feeling okay there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They, and just about everything else, feels like they&#39;re gonna fall off. That normal?&quot; Phil asked, swaying on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, if you&#39;re not used to that kind of sudden explosive workout. Here, lemme get you some of my BCAAs...sit down, sit down.&quot; Grayson guided Phil over to a seat by his desk in the weight room as he poured up a red drink for Phil to have. Phil guessed that red drink was the BCAAs the jocks here were always chattering about.<br />
<br />
But he would&#39;ve drank close to anything with how parched and uneasy he felt on his feet.<br />
<br />
Phil drank down every single drop of the BCAA drink in that cup, and near on instantly found himself feeling so much better than he had before. It wasn&#39;t an immediate cure all, but he was more than feeling able to at least move. And he also admitted that even though the deadlifts were kind of intensive and really complicated, not to mention that they drained him like that...Phil honestly looked forward to doing them again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I uh...&quot; Phil started, rubbing his forehead, &quot;Do deadlifts again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so soon,&quot; Grayson started, and looked over at the bench machines, &quot;Let&#39;s have you do some bench forms like incline and flat before you jump back over on deadlift. Throwing too much into deadlift too early can be...dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing as it seemed Grayson knew what he was talking about, Phil decided to just go with it. He started to wonder what might have caused his surge in strength. He certainly would not normally have been able to do any of that. The push ups, let alone the freaking deadlifts and getting to 20 with that much weight. What could be causing this? He started going over anything and everything in recent memory that might have caused this---<br />
<br />
The jacket. It occurred to Phil all at once. The jacket of course the jacket. He&#39;d been feeling weird ever since he put it on. And now he knew why. It had been building up his muscles! Phil almost wanted to just duck out and go put it back on, but he was excited to try out these changes to his body and see how strong he was now. This was something else. He knew he should be scared or something like that, but right now he just saw his new and improved biceps, and how his quads, even as he sat there, looked so tight and strong in his shorts...</p>
