<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the interview had ended Teri was free to go but she waited for Sarah to talk with her husband James about her clinic appointment and how he wouldn’t have go with her. Not wanting to be seen as an embarrassment for needing his wife to get a fertility treatment to compensate for his condition he was all to happy to have her go alone. Unknown to him though, Sarah had no intention of going to the appointment alone and had in fact changed the whole nature of the appointment. With a sweet goodbye that hid her actual intentions Sarah left James’s office and found Teri waiting to follow her to the parking lot. Sarah walked slowly in front of Teri and intentionally emphasized how she moved her hips because she knew the following Teri would see it and wouldn’t be able to ignore it. Sarah was rewarded for her efforts when she reached the elevators and turned around to see a sheepish Teri walking a little funny and a wetness starting to spread between her tits. Some people might have thought that Teri was unusually sweaty between her tits but Sarah knew that just out of sight below her cleavage Teri’s huge cock was leaking precum that was being squeezed up by the pressing breasts. The two said nothing while they waited for the elevator but once they were inside and alone Sarah spoke. <br />
<br />
“Congratulations on your successful interview, James had nothing but praises to say about you when I asked. I wonder how the Cuck will feel when he finds out about what we are planning to do” said Sarah as the elevator began to head down.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t say that” answered Teri instinctively, feeling oddly uncomfortable with the vindictiveness of Sarah’s tone and the plan.<br />
<br />
Taking on a more concerned and sweet tone Sarah said “I’m sorry I know you futas don’t like messing with established relationships but in the end James will probably be more happy with the relationship any ways”<br />
<br />
The original version of Teri the shy male nerd wouldn’t have been remotely concerned with cuckolding a person like James but current Teri had bad feelings about parts of it she chalked these feelings to be characteristics of Futanari in this new reality being more strongly hardwired for caring tendencies. <br />
<br />
“Here Teri your about to make a mess of your blouse let me get that” said Sarah trying to change the topic. Without a hint of embarrassment Sarah leaned over a little and buried her face into Teri’s cleavage and began licking up the leaking precum. The action made Teri blush from the attention and moan slightly as Sarah’s strong tongue would occasionally dig deeper between the cleavage and run along the cock head that was hidden their. When Sarah was done her face was a mess but Teri’s tits had less precum leaking through them. Sarah made a quick wipe of her face with a handkerchief to clean the mess then the elevator opened and they were leaving for the parking lot.<br />
<br />
With a quick kiss from Sarah, Teri left for her car as the two would be driving to the clinic separately in a halfhearted attempt at secrecy. Alone in her car Teri finally had some real time to go over the memories of her new reality and see what kind of life they had lived. Teri had much the same early childhood as she had in their original reality as a single child to two loving but busy parents. Very little had changed about her family between her other reality and this one, other than her grandmother on her father’s side now being a futanari like current Teri. This hadn’t changed much about Teri’s life as her futa grandmother acted the same as she had previously. <br />
<br />
The major changes between the realities began in early high school when puberty began to hit. Before puberty the fact that Teri was a futa wasn’t a secret but it wasn’t widely know, but when puberty hit it became the talk of the whole school.  Teri shot up quickly to become one of the tallest kids in her whole school. She also developed an enviable pair of tits before most of her peers. The most shocking change of puberty though was the incredible size gained by her previously average cock. Its size swelled to be be so large that it was hard not to be seen even while wearing normal clothes. Public decency in this reality had certain exceptions for Futanari given the larger than average size of their genitals, and even with these exceptions Teri was skirting the line of what was appropriate. <br />
<br />
The old Teri had been a quiet and dedicated student who hadn’t garnered much attention from his peers, but new Teri seemed to get nothing but attention. She was still shy and quiet but people could not ignore her. Normally this kind of attention would have made finding a girlfriend or boyfriend easy but for Teri it was no help at all. All of the girls that she was interested in were legitimately afraid of hurting themselves if they tried to have sex with her and all of the boys were too insecure at that age to date a girl who’s cock was at least three time bigger than theirs. It wasn’t until near the end of high school that Teri heard about the development of the IVEE treatment.<br />
<br />
The IVEE or (internal vaginal elongation and expansion) treatment was a drug developed using Futanari biology that allowed for the permanent expansion and elongation of the internal size of any woman’s vagina. This could make it safe for anyone to take Teri’s massive size and not worry about it being dangerous or even painful. Teri had been filled with hope when she first heard about it but was a little disappointed to learn that the treatment wouldn’t be performed on anyone under the age of 21. She would have to wait 3 years before people her age would be able to get the treatment.<br />
<br />
College was busy for Teri trying to get her degree and working part time as a barista for the first two years. In her third year of college Teri quit being a barista when she learned that she could sell her cum to rich cum addicts for high prices. Teri then began selling her cum through a business that supplied her with special collection condoms and assured her that her identity would not be shared with the buyers. She had initially been skeptical of the business but when her cum became in high demand and her earnings soared she lost most of that skepticism. Even after graduating Teri kept on with the business and had soon payed off her student loans. Teri had only quit the business recently when she realized it had turned her into a shut in. Just after that she had found Sarah and their relationship had grown. Now Teri was on her way to finally having sex as the clinic came into sight.<br />
<br />
Teri and Sarah had arrived within minutes of each other and entered the clinic together. They were a little early and would have to wait for their appointment to start so they sat down in the waiting room. Teri pulled out her phone to pass the time with and was shocked when she saw the magical app. Her reminiscing on her new life had left her viewing her old reality as a bad dream and not her own alternate life. </p>
<hr/><h3>
Does Teri use the app to pass time or does she wait for the appointment normally?</h3>
