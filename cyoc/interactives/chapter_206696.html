<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you woke up, you were greeted by a bunch of doctors. They all looked very happy. &quot;He&#39;s awake! This is a great success. Good job everybody.&quot; One of the older doctors said. You hadn&#39;t seen him before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you sit up?&quot; He asked you. You could, but it was hard. The anaesthetic was probably still affecting you. You looked down at your hands. The large, dark hands. It all felt very peculiar. It felt different breathing, as well. Besides that, you could almost swear that the world had a different tint to it. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; He asked you. It was a good question. How did you feel? In a purely physical sense, you felt fine. You figured that was the information the doctor wanted and answered &quot;Physically, I feel fine&quot;. That was definitely weird. A new voice to speak with. &quot;But it&#39;s all a bit surreal&quot; you added. &quot;Well, swapping bodies can make things feel that way&quot; the doctor told you, with a calm voice. After that, the doctors kept prodding you, while explaining how they&#39;d move forward. They&#39;d keep you over night. After that, you&#39;d be coming in for a weekly check-up on your physical and mental state. They had given you a small handheld mirror to look in. Having the face of Michael looking back at you was weird. His broad nose, his big brown eyes and shaved head. A greyish beard covering your chins. That was about all you had time to reflect on before they took the mirror away and again bombarded you with questions. There were other parts of your body you wanted to check on, but that would have to wait. After an hour of a constant stream of questions, they had finally exhausted their supply it seemed. But at this point, you felt really tired. Checking out the rest of you would have to wait. You would have a year to get used to this body, you probably didn&#39;t need to rush it.<br />
<br />
You slept like a baby all through the night. The next morning, you woke up to peace and quiet. It was strange, you hadn&#39;t been to the toilet yet, but you didn&#39;t feel a need to pee. You soon realized why. A tube was coming out from under the covers, a yellowish liquid inside it. You had been equipped with a catheter. No wonder, you had probably been out for a while during the body swap procedure. You wondered how they had done it. <br />
<br />
After a few hours, they uncoupled you from the catheter. It was a strange feeling, having something pulled out of your penis. Or Michael&#39;s penis. You weren&#39;t quite sure how to think about it, yet. As you got dressed, you were constantly observed, so you didn&#39;t feel like this was a great time to look over your body in more detail. That would have to wait for later. But the quick peek you got at your new genitals did make you a bit curious. Another man&#39;s penis was dangling between your legs and now you knew it was quite sizeable. You wondered how it would look erect. But was that weird? You had no interest in men otherwise, but for some reason you wanted to know what you&#39;d be working with for the next 365 days. Well, you would find out soon enough. <br />
<br />
They drove you back home. Your heart was now beating like mad. Standing outside your apartment building made things all that much more real. You were now about to be left alone. In this body. As you climbed the stairs, you met one of your neighbours. A black lady, similar in age to your new body. A lady you almost never spoke with, as you lived on different floors and came and went different times in the day. You recalled her name was Janelle. Janelle immediately realized this black man in front of her was someone new to the building. &quot;You visiting someone?&quot; She asked. Janelle had always been cautious of people in the building. You had learned that much. &quot;Uh, no... I&#39;m actually sub renting from someone that lives here. I&#39;m going to be living here for the next year&quot; you answered. That went well, you thought. No slip ups.  &quot;Oh&quot; Janelle said, with a smile. &quot;Well, nice to meet you...?&quot; she added, extending her arm, waiting for you to answer with your name. &quot;Michael&quot; You said as you shook her hand. &quot;Hi Michael, I&#39;m Janelle. If you need something, ANYTHING, don&#39;t be afraid to come knocking. I live on the third floor. First door to the left.&quot; Janelle told you, while looking you up and down with a flirty look.  You knew Janelle was single and from the looks of it, perhaps a real man eater. As long as the person was of the right demographic. She had never been this upfront with you before. You didn&#39;t mind it, thought. Always felt good to be wanted. You said your goodbyes and you finally got inside your apartment. <br />
<br />
You quickly locked the door behind you and walked into the bathroom. You decided to sate your curiosity. You got yourself undressed and looked at yourself in the bathroom mirror. Your first assessment of Michael had been correct. You had a very well shaped chest given his... your age. Two large arms, packing a lot of muscle and wide shoulders. You were also correct about the midsection. While your stomach was hard, it was also quite large. The fact the muscles laid atop your fat reserves made you look bulky rather than fat. Probably not good for ones health, but you&#39;d only be Michael for a year. His abdominal fat was just a temporary problem. You looked down at the dark rod between your legs. The excitement of looking at your new temporary body had made you partially erect. But your curiosity got the better of you. You started tugging at it while thinking about a girl you always knew could get you going. Just long enough to get fully erect. The black dick was now at it&#39;s maximum size. You ran out into the kitchen to get a tape measure. 10 inches? That&#39;s insane. The fact the penis was somebody else&#39;s didn&#39;t bother you, you were too busy being impressed by the size of your new cock. You had been 6 inches erect prior. You couldn&#39;t help wondering how Michael felt. Had he had the time to inspect his equipment? Was he disappointed? Well, he did get to enjoy being young again. Even if only for a year. And he got to be white. That probably had it&#39;s upsides in more subtle ways. <br />
<br />
You did have his number. You could call him and ask.</p>
