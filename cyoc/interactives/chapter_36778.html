<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Glancing back at the paper, you see that new words are appearing at the bottom:
<P><i>If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter'.</i>
<P>You decide to do as the paper says, fearing what misfortune could happen to you if you don't. Without even glancing at the person sitting behind and to the right of you, you toss the paper onto his desk.
<P>* * *
<P>Christopher was very annoyed right now. Not only had that bitch Sunnytush interrupted class, she was now showing disrespect for the teacher by passing notes.
<P>He had half a mind to stuff the paper into his own backpack instead of being caught passing it, but his curiosity had gotten the better of him. Besides, he had read ahead in this chapter last night, so zoning out Mr. Bard's lecture was no big deal.
<P>A girl's handwriting (probably Sunnytush's) laid out the instructions.
<P><i>To my new friend,
<P>You look so bored, just sitting there. Here's a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.</i>
<P>"I'm not your friend," Chris thought to himself. He continued reading. He was supposed to give answers that were as truthful as possible, and if he stopped for whatever reason, something bad would happen. Typical chain letter mumbo jumbo.
<P>He proceeded onto the list of questions.
<P>Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?
<P>If he was a girl? An odd topic for this questionnaire, but he figurd it would help him think outside the box, which was never a bad thing. More to the point, Chris' handwriting was terrible. He had always admired most girls for their clean handiwork. He wrote down "Yes."
<P>Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?
<P>"Not really, but I wouldn't hate it."
<P>Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?
<P>Chris liked this question. He had an affinity for long hair on women, and he knew his exact preference. "Straight, with a slight wave." He didn't notice that his handwriting was starting to become more legible.
<P>Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?
<P>"Purple, with black a close runner-up."
<P>Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?
<P>"Black, with natural purple streaks." He had always wished nature would allow hair to come in all kinds of colors. That way, some of the girls wouldn't have to deal with the trouble of dying it.
<P>Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?
<P>"Blue." His writing was now in a distinctive cursive style, and in purple ink. He was so caught up in the questions he still hadn't noticed anything was different.
<P>Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like makeup?
<P>Chris never liked excessive makeup on women. However, he had started to take a liking to goths recently, and began to picture in his mind a well made-up goth girl.
<P>"Yes, but not traditional makeup. I would have purple eye shadow, black lipstick, and a tattoo of a butterfly on my left cheek."
<P>Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?
<P>"No."
<P>Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?
<P>"No."
<P>Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?
<P>"Yes, preferably a long fancy one."
<P>His legs felt drafty all of a sudden, but he figured it was just a gust of wind through the open window.
<P>Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?
<P>"Yes. I would have several earings and a nose ring, as well as necklaces."
<P>As he wrote each item down, he could have sworn he actually felt the piercings happening to his own face.
<P>Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?
<P>"B cup."
<P>His chest began to feel heavier for some reason.
<P>Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?
<P>He couldn't ever imagine falling for a dude. He wrote a simple "No." He'd sooner be a lesbian than date a guy, no matter what his gender was.
<P>Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?
<P>This was a tough one. Society required women to be presentable, and even in this day and age, that implied activities such as shaving frequently, which he was sure were total time killers. He thought carefully before he wrote "I would have already had procedures to prevent the need for me to shave my armpits, legs, and pubic hair."
<P>Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?
<P>"Pads." Something shifted in his underwear, but he simply scratched his butt and continued on.
<P>Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?
<P>"I would be wearing a black dress shirt with puffy shoulders and long sleeves."
<P>Chris jumped in his chair when he saw something suddenly land on his arm. He jerked his arm by instinct, but had already come to realize that the thing that had "landed" on his arm was a long black sleeve. He looked at himself and saw that he was wearing the exact same shirt he had just described. It was stylish enough for a goth girl to wear with further ornamentation...but why was he wearing it? And what were those two bumps on his chest?
<P>He felt the mounds through the shirt and made an almost inaudible gasp. He could feel his hands groping his chest. He had breasts! Another thought came to mind, and he felt the region between his legs. He couldn't find his manhood. As impossible as it sounded, he was somehow turning into a girl.
<P>He looked around at the class, but everyone was either doing work or listening to the teacher. Nobody seemed to have noticed his changes. He looked over the questionnaire again, cross-checking the answers he had written with physical evidence. He found a ring in his nose and necklaces around his neck. He felt the weight of heavy earrings dangling from his ears, no doubt large silver crosses like the ones he imagined when he answered the jewelry question.
<P>He also had on the skirt he envisioned when he wrote "a long and fancy one." It was black with a pleated purple lining that stuck out a few inches below it. The skirt reached down to his calves.
<P>One thing was clear: He had to stop answering these questions if he wanted to stop changing. But wait, the instructions warned him NOT to stop. He had to continue it to the end. Maybe he'd have the chance to take it all back. Maybe this was all a silly dream and he had been put to sleep by the lecture. He decided anything was better than sitting there, half man and half-woman. He picked up his purple-ink pen and continued writing his feminine cursive.
<P>Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?
<P>He had to put more thought into these now that he knew the reality of the quiz. "Bikini." He felt his underwear shift.
<P>Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.
<P>He decided that smarter was better than dumber, and the smarter he was, the better chance he'd be able to avoid traps like this freaky test. He decided on "9," one number higher than he believed his own level to be right now.
<P>Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?
<P>"A simple black bra that offered good support. Sometimes, I would also wear a black and purple bodice over my shirt with several belts that keep my breasts in place while augmenting my small figure."
<P>The weight on his chest shifted as the bra formed on him. It felt oddly comfortable.
<P>Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don't lie)
<P>Chris always liked petite women, and was tired of being one of the tallest kids in the school. He decided that a fresh perspective might be interesting. "I would be 16, 4'9", and 110 lbs."
<P>Suddenly, the desk grew larger around him. After a second of disorientation, he realized that he had shrunk to the height he wrote, which was over a foot shorter than his real height. He looked around and saw that his head was a little lower than most of the other students. He was used to peering over everyone's heads. Now he couldn't even read the bottom few lines on the chalkboard without sitting straight up.
<P>Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?
<P>He thought about goth footwear, and also about his new height, and came up with the perfect solution to satisfy both. "Knee-high black boots with silver buckles and six-inch platforms, to bring my height around the average."
<P>His trainers magically changed instantly into platform boots, which sucked up half of his legs with their leather. His knees rose up six inches, making his lap diagonally inclined down toward his crotch. He tried to space his legs out, but he discovered there really wasn't much room under the desk for six inches of boot soles. He settled into a comfortable sitting position with both feet firmly planted on the floor, and continued.
<P>Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?
<P>"I would have a studded leather collar with a silver tag with my name on it. I would have thigh-high purple leggings and matching fingerless gloves."
<P>As he wrote the second sentence, his neck felt constricted, and he knew that was his new collar. The leggings and gloves/arm warmers showed up shortly afterward. Most of the gloves were hidden under his long sleeves, but he could feel that they went up to her elbow. He had to admit, the purple and black color scheme he picked out was looking pretty nice.
<P>Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?
<P>Paydirt. Another hair question. He had sometimes wondered how he would wear his hair if he had it long, and he would constantly be on the lookout for long-haired girls that matched his favorite styles. He decided to go a little overboard with this answer. He couldn't help himself.
<P>"Ankle-length and very thick. I consider it my best feature and haven't cut it since the first grade. It would be braided into four pigtails, each tied by a purple ribbon."
<P>Something that felt like lengths of rope slapped across his back, and he heard something soft hit the floor. He looked down, and a thick black braid swooped in front of his vision. He now had the very hair he imagined. It fell in four thick pigtails all the way to the floor.
<P>Not wanting them to get dirty, he picked the four ropes of hair up and draped them over his lap. They were remarkably hefty. It seemed like each one could have come from a totally full head of hair, which suggested to him that his hair was four times as thick as it should be. It felt surreal, but incredible. A heat welled up inside him, and he felt a strange brewing in his lower regions. He...SHE...was getting turned on, and she had never felt what that was like for a woman before.
<P>Chris tried to steady her breath, knowing that he couldn't stop now. He was so close to the end. He could freak out over his luscious long hair later. The final question...
<P>Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?
<P>She thought about writing "Chris," as it was an ambiguous name, but she decided if she was going to be a different person, she might as well answer to a different name. After a minute, she wrote down "Kat. (That's short for Kat.)"
<P>With the survey complete, a new message appeared at the bottom:
<P><i>If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter'.</i>
<P>Kat was about to pass the note onto the pretty girl sitting next to her, but decided against it. "This turned me into a girl," she thought. "It might do the opposite to her." She couldn't fathom the image of a pretty girl like her turning into a greasy, ugly boy. Boys were so overrated. It would be better to change one of them into a girl instead of adding to their ranks.
<P>Kat passed the paper to the boy sitting behind her, and just as she did the period bell rang.</p>
