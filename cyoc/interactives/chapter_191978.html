<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Passing nearby was an middle-aged man with a female dalmatian dog. Cody had always liked dalmatians, so he looked at the dog lost in though, and noticed a unique feature on her eyes: one was blue and the other was brown. Cody was so fascinated by this that he got up and walked towards the man to know more about the dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, mister&quot; said Cody, startling the man a bit. &quot;Um, I noticed that your dog has heterochromia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a lot of people point that out to me,&quot; said the man, weirded out by Cody&#39;s approach.<br />
<br />
The dog was relatively calm. Even after Cody got near her owner, she barely reacted, sniffing Cody for a moment and then backing up. The man noticed Cody was distraught with the dog, &quot;Son, are you interested in my dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes. I like dalmatians, but yours was very unique, due to her eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to offer me something to buy her?&quot; asked the man, in a serious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Cody was caught off guard by the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to buy my dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I just... wanted to talk to you about it. Sorry if I was bothering you, mister.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Cody&#39;s answer, the man felt somewhat relieved. &quot;Don&#39;t worry boy, it&#39;s just that, every time someone mentions the eyes of Ruby, they want to take her away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Cody looked at the dog, Ruby, again, who seemed tired. &quot;How old is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s 9 years old, and she&#39;s been with me for five years already.&quot; Although the man didn&#39;t trust much in Cody at the beginning, he could see that the boy didn&#39;t mean to do anything bad. &quot;Do you want to pet her,&quot; he asked, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! If you don&#39;t have a problem with it,&quot; said Cody. The man nodded, giving Cody the go-ahead, though when he brought his hand close to the Ruby&#39;s head, she moved it, trying to get away from Cody, which made him feel slightly disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, she&#39;s a mistrustful of other people because she&#39;s deaf on one ear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody felt bad for the dog. He knew that there are no treatments for dog&#39;s deafness, but this gave him an idea. &quot;What if I transformed the dog into a human?&quot; he thought, and it also made him ask why he didn&#39;t think of transforming an animal into a human before.<br />
<br />
Cody said goodbye to the middle-aged man, in order to set up the remote control without him noticing. The remote offered an option to set transformation type: &quot;set animal&quot; and &quot;set human&quot; were two of the options that appeared there, and really the only ones in which Cody was interested at the moment. He pressed &quot;Set human,&quot; but the interface of the remote didn&#39;t change, in fact, it stayed the same. Cody assumed that this was because the remote was set for humans by default, so he continued with the procedures. Gender &quot;female,&quot; age &quot;30,&quot; &quot;transform now.&quot; A red beam of light hit the dalmatian dog.<br />
<br />
Ruby felt itchy on her side, so she decided to scratch it, but the itch expanded to the rest of her body. She whined at the same time as she tried to make her itch disappear. The black spots scattered on her coat began to reunite on the top of her head, until only her head was black. Her hair on that area of her head grew as well, to the point that it seemed as if the dog was wearing a black hair wig. The coat in the rest of her body began to recede, and the pink skin underneath slightly darkened, getting a skin tone proper of a Caucasian human. The only hair she had now was on her head.<br />
<br />
Ruby didn&#39;t look like a dalmatian anymore, but she soon didn&#39;t look like a dog either. Her four legs began to gain muscle, and her feet reshaped. As her bone structure changed too, Ruby whined, but a change could be noticed on her voice, as it transitioned from dog whines to more distinguishable woman groans. Her limbs had elongated, and her two frontal paws became human hands, while the two on the back had the shape of human feet. It was uncomfortable for her to stand in four, fully stretching her limbs, so she knelt. The rest of her body changed, most noticeably, her tail shortened and disappeared. Her butt gained mass and got rounder, and, thanks to its softness, acted as a cushion for her to sit while the changes went on. Her several nipples disappeared, leaving only two, and her chest expanded with two busts, which grew to C-cup. She was getting taller and hit 5&#39;8&quot;.<br />
<br />
While her body looked like that of a slim athletic woman, Ruby&#39;s face still looked like that of a dog, but with medium-length hair on her head. Her skull reshaped, finally assimilating to a human one. Her muzzle got way shorter, retracting into her face, and her nose lost its black color to take the same one as her skin. Her floppy ears accommodated into human ones, and her eye irises shrunk. Her hair covered her face, so she used her hand to remove it, without any trouble, like she had been a human for all her life. Thin eyebrows appeared.<br />
<br />
The transformation was finished, and Ruby was a human woman, a beautiful one at that. She sat crossing her legs, examining her body. She removed her leash and collar, then got up. As the time resumed, Ruby kept walking alongside the middle-aged man, both of them didn&#39;t seem to mind that Ruby was naked on a mall, and neither did the bystanders.<br />
<br />
Cody saw the transformation and wanted to see how Ruby acted now as a human, so he ran again towards the man and asked for her age, to what the man this time answered with &quot;30 years old.&quot; Now that he was near Ruby, Cody admired the body of the woman, whose eyes kept the heterochromia. Ruby stood there unflinching and silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have plants to treat her deafness?&quot; asked Cody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;re actually on our way to visit a doctor to check her hearing and consult to get a hearing aid.&quot; The man&#39;s answer was a relief to Cody. His transformation this time had done something more than just amuse him.<br />
<br />
The next question on Cody&#39;s mind seemed silly, but he thought it was necessary to ask &quot;Can your- Does she know how to speak?&quot; Ruby was a dog moments before, but now she was a human, supposedly in every way. She kept her features as a dog such as her black hair, her eyes, and her muscular body. She was very close to the man, so she still viewed him as her owner and was loyal to him. Ruby&#39;s ability to speak was a good thing to question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she&#39;s just shy,&quot; explained the man. &quot;Say bye to the boy, Ruby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye&quot; said Ruby. Her voice was clear. It was only one word but Cody could perceive that she had a powerful voice. He saw the odd couple walk away. Ruby&#39;s stride confident and straight.</p>
