<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Juantiller for the rough draft of this chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tex kept pace with the red-haired elf. He wasn’t sure if the Book in the elf’s hand was the real one or just a false Book, similar in nature to the ones they’d given Todd. But it had to be the real one, with the amount of changes he’d seen thus far. The amount of energy needed to invest a fake Book with even this much power was mind boggling.<br />
<br />
He passed a few Leonin, some dwarves and even some minotaurs. Compared to them he seemed quite small, though his musculature likely rivaled them at the very least.It was…Oddly refreshing not to be the biggest person in the room. All of them were wearing next to nothing, flaunting their sexy bodies. Not…entirely odd for a sex toy convention, true, but he wasn’t sure if this much lewdness was allowed.  It was mostly about pitching products to retail stores and websites. Maybe he was a prude.<br />
<br />
He glanced up towards the entrance and felt a shiver run down his spine. The convention sign had changed. Before, it had been rather businesslike-not even referring to sex toys, instead as personal recreation devices. Now it had fornication front and center. Patrons were now actually fucking on the floor, most of their clothing reduced to thongs and leather gear and…nothing at all, in many cases.<br />
<br />
Tex felt a breeze ruffle his chest fur, making his nipples hard. He looked down. His own clothes had changed. He now wore a leather harness and tight leather shorts, his bulge lewdly prominent. He started hearing catcalls as the various convention-goers-turned-orgy-enjoyers noticed him. Tex blushed, cock hardening.<br />
<br />
What the hell is this dude’s plan? Tex wondered. Make everyone naked so they can’t conceal their Book?<br />
<br />
He continued following the elf, feeling the electric tingle of reality shifting in his wake. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he kept being accosted by people who wanted to fuck him or, worse, wanted him to invest in their ideas. At least the people who wanted sex took no for an answer. He could see his products being used by guests big and small, carried in bags. The other vendors wanted on board. Guests wanted to be the next image on his line. Some even had improvements and critiques. Those he could actually use, so he handed them his business card and told them to e-mail him. <br />
<br />
The closer he got to the elf, the more people wanted to talk him up. It was incredibly frustrating. Although, and to be fair, some of the people accosting him actually had good ideas and he listened while walking before writing his personal number on the back of the card and told them to talk to his secretary to set up an appointment.<br />
<br />
By the time he looked up, the elf had disappeared back into the crowd again. Tex cussed silently in his head. He’d just got done talking to a couple from Vermont. Two people back he’d spoken to a man from Texas with a physical store. All of these people would cause enormous amount of Paradox when they went back home. This Myth guy, he assumed, was an utter moron.<br />
<br />
The convention grew more confusing, more labyrinthine the more he walked. Orgies were a common sight now, often in corners of the building. He found himself stepping around more and more writhing bodies. He finally spotted the elf at a food stand manned by an orc and a kobold.<br />
<br />
He stepped up behind the elf and ordered the same thing he had-hot dog and fries. Also some soda, he was freaking parched. The elf sat down at a booth and Tex sat across from him. The elf looked over at him, and Tex handed him his card.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, you’re the guy running that booth?” the red-haired elf exclaimed. “Dude! It’s a pleasure.”<br />
<br />
“Tex.” <br />
<br />
“Mark! Er, that’s my human name. I am Ameav&#39;Vendill of the Autumn Court.” The elf’s eyes gleamed. “You’re a little on the short side for a Minotaur, aren’t you? Nice tats, tho. Not really in the Greek style.”<br />
<br />
“Had a kinky boyfriend.” Tex shrugged and handed him his card. “Let me know if you’d like to apply as a product tester.”<br />
<br />
“No way, free shit!” Ameav&#39;Vendill’s eyes went wide. “Bro. I would be honored. Magic sex toys? Why the hell didn’t I think of that!”<br />
<br />
Tex smiled and pretended to enjoy his lunch. Ameav&#39;Vendill ogled the card happily and glanced up. Tex followed his line of sight and spotted what had caught his attention.<br />
<br />
Two human males, shy, lanky, nervous looking. They were looking around in excitement but also terror. They seemed to be having second thoughts, looking at all the beautiful bodies here. Tex understood not wanting to be the odd one out.<br />
<br />
Tex saw Ameav&#39;Vendill’s finger point at them. Any words he spoke were lost under the general noise of the convention. <br />
<br />
The males started to grow, a green coloration pigmenting their skin. As they grew in height, they also grew in width, their lanky forms packing on muscle to the point that they might actually stand a chance against Tex in a wrestling contest. One of them grew a wild mane of thick black hair while the other’s hair fell out, leaving them completely bald and  scars started to appear on their faces and bodies.<br />
<br />
Their clothes, which had ripped apart at the seams, were next to alter. Their shredded pants became simple loincloths, the tips of their cocks and balls peeking out from the bottoms of their ill-fitting garments. Their wristwatches repaired themselves, adjusting to fit their massive, python-like arms. Their wallet and phones appeared to be in a bag they carried on their sides.<br />
<br />
The meek looks they had eased and shifted into eager grins, tusks poking through their lower lips. Their faces altered with that shift in expression, becoming more brutish and pig-like, and their ears became pointed. More of Tex’s products appeared in their bags, the bald one actually licking the Rocket Pop dildo like a lollipop. <br />
<br />
No one around them seemed to have noticed the change, the orcs did not appear shocked by the change. As the orcs headed deeper into the convention, loincloths strained, clearly looking for someone to fuck, Tex chanced a glance at the Elf. <br />
<br />
Ameav&#39;Vendil appeared deeply pleased with the results, a huge smile on his face. Tex knew that look. It was one he’d had many times whenever he changed people for the better. Those guys had wanted to be orcs. This Ameav&#39;Vendil was using the spell in a pure and uncorrupted way.<br />
<br />
Tex was confused now. The Book was almost certainly the real deal. How did this..Mark, come to obtain it? Had he defeated the other owner in battle or stole it somehow? The intel they had on the Book of Myth strongly indicated the owner was rich like Tex was-richer, even. Troy, RK, and Rusty were supposed to be meeting him at their airbnb for a meeting later today. Now this guy was running around changing people into fantasy creatures. He hadn’t sensed any ill-intent towards those two men and certainly none from Ameav&#39;Vendill himself.<br />
<br />
A cold shiver crept up his spine and a coppery tingle swept across his tongue.<br />
<br />
Tex shot a sharp look at Ameav&#39;Vendill, who was lowering his finger and smiling. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad I got to meet you, Texos.” Ameav&#39;Vendill stood, and Texos noticed the twunk was wearing very little except an autumn leaf to conceal his thick elven cock. “I was wondering if you’d like to show an elf like me a good time.”<br />
<br />
Texos’s turgid length pounded to attention as he stared at the handsome elf.  He stood, dizzy, horns capped in gold almost touching the ceiling. He looked down at himself, past his heaving, straining chest that threatened to bust the straps of his harness and the shaggy fur that covered him to the tattoos that covered his body. They’d changed, lettering becoming ancient Greek and glowing faintly. His cock strained the leather loincloth he wore.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to, Ameav&#39;Vendill.” Texos found himself saying in a deep, compelling bass. He smiled and the ring on his hand that reminded him of Rusty vanished.<br />
<br />
What is happening to him? Texos knew the guy had cast a spell on him but he should be protected from it. The Book of Beasts had already changed him, for one thing. Oh god, was he so close to a Minotaur that it was really just that simple to override?!<br />
<br />
New memories were flooding his mind.He was Texos, owner and Dungeon Master of The Maze, an exclusive underground sex club. Not only did he own a warehouse in Arizona, he also sold all his magical sex toys here. Ameav&#39;Vendil was a VIP from the Fae Lands. For some reason, he also knew the location of every single living being in the walls of his dungeon. Veins popped out along his arms and pecs, visible through his thick pecs as his muscles strained and grew, spine popping once more.<br />
<br />
His arm encircled the elf, thick three-fingered hand groping his ass. Ameav&#39;Vendil giggled, flipping his long red locks and leaned happily into Texos chest, thin elven fingers rubbing his abs through his fur coat. Texos grinned and hoisted Ameav&#39;Vendil up on one arm, giving his groin a lick with his thick tongue.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ameav&#39;Vendil smiled. “Where’s your, uh office?”<br />
<br />
“Back here.” Texos rumbled.<br />
<br />
As he walked back to the center of The Maze, the crowd parted for him.<br />
<br />
“Man, how can you navigate a maze like this? Do you have some sort of sixth sense about it?”<br />
<br />
Texos nodded and inwardly cringed. “I own the maze. I know of any action taken inside. I can never get lost.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my gods it worked!” Ameav&#39;Vendil squealed and kicked his legs happily. “I cannot wait to try some more stuff!”<br />
<br />
They entered the main area of The Maze. The area was huge, a vast hall with a bar along one end and a stage on the other. Tables and a dance floor were set up in the middle. Behind the bar was Texos’ office. He strode in and closed the door behind him with a kick from his hoof.<br />
<br />
Texos knew he needed to confront the Book user, but his throbbing erection had not gone down. His Minotaur senses allowed him to know every action taken in the Maze. And right now, every action involved sex. An overwhelming amount of sex. <br />
<br />
Texos threw the twunky elf onto his bed and started licking out his ass with his tongue. Th elf moaned happily as Texos lubed every inch of his backside.<br />
<br />
“I uh, used the Licker.” The elf panted. “I…I can take you.”<br />
<br />
The Minotaur picked up the elf and faced him towards his huge chest and lowered him onto his massive horsecock. Ameav&#39;Vendil’s inner walls were tight and clenched around his girth, but still, he managed to slide down his almost two-foot length with ease, bottoming out at the base of Texos’s baseball sized testicles.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you’re perfect.” Ameav&#39;Vendil breathed, rubbing his face between Texos’s furry pecs.<br />
<br />
Texos licked his lips, pausing as he felt his teeth had changed to ones more appropriate to a carnivore than an herbivore. Then he began to lift and drop the elf, over and over again, Medial Ring rubbing the elf’s g-spot again and again, relentlessly.<br />
<br />
“Man, oh shit.” Ameav&#39;Vendil’s toes curled. “Don’t stop!”<br />
<br />
Texos growled, an odd sound coming from his throat, and dropped the elf onto the bed and started pounding. The elf’s feet started to flail from overstimulation. Texos’s long tongue wrapped around the elf’s cock and began slurping it with gusto.<br />
<br />
“Texos, I-” Ameav&#39;Vendil’s voice shook.<br />
<br />
Texos sucked harder. Delightfully sweet elven semen shot onto his tongue in four quick spurts. The elf sagged and relaxed on Texos’s bed.<br />
<br />
The Minotaur stood and walked away, making himself a whiskey sour. “Would you care for a drink, Ameav&#39;Vendil?”<br />
<br />
“Um, do you have any…erm, magical drinks?”<br />
<br />
The Minotaur snorted. “Don’t like the taste of alcohol?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.” The elf shrugged. “A Black Claw?”<br />
<br />
The Minotaur shook out a few drops of a vial he had in his cabinet. It fizzed and sparked on contact with the Blue Bull and Daggermesiter he made. He handed the concoction to the elf.<br />
<br />
The elf took a tentative sip and sighed happily. “Much better than it usually tastes!”<br />
<br />
“As a fellow magic user, I would like to speak with you about a few things.” Texos said, hooflets resting on the elf’s thighs.<br />
<br />
“W-What’s wrong, did something happen?” Ameav&#39;Vendil’s hand dropped to the Book in his bag.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m concerned about the amount of magic you’ve been outputting.” Texos smiled. “I am not going to punish you, do not worry.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, so why bring it up at all?” The elf demanded.<br />
<br />
“Because you need to understand the power you are meddling with. You lack the mannerisms of the Autumn Court, which means you were raised here, on Earth, and not in the Fae World. The artifact you are so desperately clutching is quite dangerous.”<br />
<br />
Ameav&#39;Vendil tightened his grip on the Book of Myth. “Dangerous? Dangerous how?”<br />
<br />
“It can alter reality. For example, I saw you turn those two nerdy guys into sex-crazed orcs.” Texos shrugged. “Did you fix them or objectify them?”<br />
<br />
“They chose it and they seemed happy.” the Elf shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Did I choose to be a Minotaur?” <br />
<br />
“People respect you! You’re huge and rich and you own a sex club in LA and have magic! Plus, if you’re naked, I’d be able to see if you had a Book.” Ameav&#39;Vendil objected. “Just look at yourself! You’re basically a Greek god!”<br />
<br />
Texos turned where his mirror was hanging on the wall. He flexed, feeling a shiver creep up his spine. He blinked, snorting, as a sense of compression hit him. His body seemed off, a bit shorter, muscles built in hard labor and not at the gym. Was his forehead flatter?<br />
<br />
“Say again?” Terxos’s tongue felt thick in his mouth, Greek accent heavy. “My English is…not so good.”<br />
<br />
Ameav&#39;Vendil’s hand circled around him, stroking his still-rigid cock. “I said come back to bed. I’ll take care of that for you, Terxos.”<br />
<br />
There was something else, he knew. Something about a book? Gah! He’d deal with it later. The handsome elf guided him back to his bed and he laid down and let the elf soothe away his painful erection with his soft hands.<br />
<br />
“There we go. Relax. You’re thinking too hard.” Ameav&#39;Vendil whispered something near his crotch as his hand moved.<br />
<br />
Xarxos felt that tingle and felt that sense of compression again. Much like the signals to his brain, the elf’s gentle strokes took longer to reach the tip of his cock, the other hand rubbing his swelling balls. The Minotaur mooed happily, feeling relaxation sweep over him.<br />
<br />
 “&#952;&#949;&#959;&#943; &#960;&#959;&#965; &#945;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#940;!” Xarxos whimpered.<br />
<br />
“I don’t even know what that means.” The elf said, “But I bet you like it.”<br />
<br />
The elf’s gentle, insistent strokes were becoming too much for the brute to take. He huffed, climax rapidly approaching, the elf’s silken hands sliding up and down his cock. His hooves kicked and his tail flicked and- <br />
<br />
One of the Minotaur’s hands brushed the Book of Myth as his cock began to spew molten white magma all over his silk sheets. <br />
<br />
Tex’s eyes shot open and he said. “Shift.”<br />
<br />
His body returned to his normal Minotaur self.<br />
<br />
Mark was looking at him now, eyes widening as he realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
“Alteration.” Tex pointed.<br />
<br />
Mark’s mouth smoothed over. He brought his hands up to his mouth in panic.<br />
<br />
“You’re hyperventilating. Breathe through your nose.” Tex advised. “And don’t you dare reduce my intelligence again. Did you really think that I, a Minotaur, would not recognize an ensorclement?”<br />
<br />
Mark’s shouts were muffled.<br />
<br />
“I have no wish for your Book. However, there is a very evil man who owns it. I’m going to guess he loaned it to you.” Tex smiled. “You will have it back after this conversation.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s reply was muffled.<br />
<br />
“Did he tell you about Paradox? The Auditors?” Tex asked.<br />
<br />
Mark’s head wobbled.<br />
<br />
“Somewhat? Okay.” Tex pointed. “Half the people here re from another state where there are no orcs or fairies or elves…Do you know what will happen when they return home?”<br />
<br />
Mark shook his head. <br />
<br />
“You get Audited. God only knows what will happen then.” Tex sighed. “And I don’t want that. You’re doing some cool shit here, Mark! But you make damn sure you are free of Paradox by the end of the day.”<br />
<br />
Tex pointed. “Alteration.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s mouth returned. He opened and shut his jaw experimentally.<br />
<br />
“How do I stop Paradox?” the elf asked.<br />
<br />
“Either undo the effects on the out-of-towners or contract with a proper Divine authority and have them intercede on your behalf. It will likely require performing a deed.” Tex wasn’t sure how he knew that, but he did. “I actually recommend the latter at this point.”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded. “I wasn’t going to leave you like that.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe. What would have happened if I took the Book?”<br />
<br />
“*Poof* Goes right back to Sebastian.”<br />
<br />
Tex nodded. “Have a good day. Remember, let them decide what the wish.”<br />
<br />
Mark swallowed. “I usually do, but I got carried away with you.”<br />
<br />
Tex waved the elf out of his office and collapsed. That was close. A thought occurred to him. Where was Todd anyways? In this reality he was selling product at the retail counter but no one was manning it right now.<br />
<br />
“Damn.” Tex dug out his cellphone from his tote bag and dialed Troy’s number.</p>
