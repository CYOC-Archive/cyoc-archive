<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Focuses on a girl who transforms others into multiple inanimate objects)<br />
<br />
As the general turned around the corner to Hallway F, his feet stumbled over a broomstick. The fate of that man didn‘t concern the General more than to keep his confident walk upright. The corridors had appeared bleak, grey and dead to him ever since. Now they looked like a children‘s room. All sorts of toys laid scattered around the floor, like a teddy bear, a plastic dinosaur, a pile of LEGOs, a bunch of green toy soldiers or a rocking horse. One of the twelve soldiers who followed him mumbled something, but the general couldn‘t command him to be silent, nor hear what it was about. All he knew was that they screwed up. Big times. <br />
Footprints were coming closer. ‘The girl‘, the general thought for a moment. ‘She‘s still here. To get me, too‘. He made a gesture with his hand which ordered his men to rise their full-automatic guns. They stopped, kneeled down and all aimed at the corner in front. <br />
„Don‘t shoot“. An unpleasant voice, but a welcome one. At least it wasn‘t the girl, but the professor who came around the corner, with his assistant in tow. <br />
„Professor“, the general said, trying to hide his fear and sounding as harsh as it was possible for him. „I‘ll make sure that your team and your program will be held fully responsible for this incident. You neglected and ignored significant safety precautions and potential dangers and you will answer to-“. <br />
„And I will gladly do so, General“, the professor interrupted with a soft and sad voice. „Project Shift was a mistake from the get go. If it comes to an accusation, I‘ll have you reminded of the complaint I submitted the day it went into operation. My team has nothing to do with this... this slaughter“. His voice got harder and more reproachful. The general knew that he had lost this argument before it had even began. „Your military forces wanted a weapon that would win their fights for them. See what happens when you treat a teen like some weapon. When you kidnap a homeless girl, give her powers that even we don‘t understand and teach her that killing and destruction is morally tenable so that she wouldn‘t disobey an order, like blowing up a village in the Middle East or enter the minds of chiefs of states. When you put hateful thoughts into her mind by your inhuman, unnecessary painful experiments. The serum was ready. But we weren‘t. I was given the order to proceed as fast as possible“. <br />
The general felt humiliated. He stood upright and pointed a threatening finger at  at the woman behind the professor. „This is your fault as well. Where is the subject now?“. <br />
„The serum enhanced her powers significantly“, she said and swallowed. „She could have teleported anywhere on the planet. It‘d be a waste of time searching the area“. <br />
„Then start coming up with solutions“, the general said, but it sounded more like begging. „This... this girl of yours belongs contained. If the public finds out about this, the entire reputation of our military will turn into dust“. <br />
The professor scratched his forehead, took his glasses off and sighted. „That would be the least of our concerns. Unfortunately the situation is much vaster than you obviously imagine“.<br />
„I haven‘t asked for your opinion. I was asking for goddamn solutions“. <br />
„Margo‘s abilities seem to have augmented since she‘s been injected with sample 94 four days ago. It was much more responsive to her than we could have ever imagined. It was the success you monkeys in your shiny uniforms are searching for“. <br />
„You‘re forgetting who your sponsors are, professor“, the general said and started to question himself how much of this his own fault was. „How big was your success then?“. <br />
„It‘s... incredible. Truly. She managed to bypass all our safety precautions. We weren‘t prepared for this.“ <br />
The general didn‘t care that he sweated, and that the others might see how nervous he actually was. „We spent billions for this. With a B!“. He sighted and nodded. „What will we be facing, Professor? Just what can the military do to execute this girl?“. <br />
„I don‘t know“, the man in the white tunic said. „But if we don‘t get her, innocents will suffer. She has spent the last four years in a single room. She has shown to act very impulsive. And as we feared, in the last two years we first noticed an increasing lack of sympathy and empathy for other people. As time progressed, this turned into hatred. Not just towards us, no, hatred towards all of humanity. She just... stopped caring. If you had actually read my reports, you would know that Margo could merely find joy in the suffering of others during the last couple of months. She turned her psychologist into a pencil and bragged for an entire week about it. She kept saying ,I‘ll turn you all, I‘ll turn you all‘, and shortly after, the man who brought her food fell victim to her, because he had opened the door flap a little too wide. We haven‘t created a weapon, General. We have created a sociopath. A monster.“ <br />
„Stop with the horror stories, Professor. How many men died today?“<br />
„You really don‘t have any clue about her! She doesn‘t kill. Nobody died today.“<br />
Anger turned into confusion. „That girl transformed my task force into toys!“<br />
„But your men are still conscious inside those toys. We have measured regular brain functions in those objects. Her victims are still able to see, to hear and to think. But nothing else.“<br />
„Jesus Christ.“ The General took off his hand and wiped over his sweating forehead. „Can they be brought back?“<br />
Both shook their head no. „We fear that those transformations are permanent. And considering that objects don‘t age, it‘s possible that they‘ll live like that forever.“<br />
„What are our options then? How can we find her?“<br />
„By all respect, General, but I‘m out of here. If she tracks me down, I‘ll suffer the same fate as all those poor men. And so will you.“<br />
<br />
„How right you are, dear professor.“ That voice. The voice from the recordings. Her voice! The general dropped his hat. The order to shoot the spy in disguise stuck inside his throat, and he had just enough time to flip over to see what happened. „Bye, Bye, boys“. And thus eleven masked and protective clothing wearing men stiffened, as if each had been struck by an electric jolt. Their black helmets and pants changed color to light brown, while their torsos developed four lines in green, yellow, red and dark brown. It all happened so fast, the general merely blinked and the men‘s arms, legs and heads were melded into their shrinking bodies, flattened and fell on the floor. Within the twinkling of an eye, there where the soldiers had stood now eleven cheeseburgers dripped with ketchup. All except for one had hit the ground. This one burger hovered shortly over the others, then flew directly into the remaining soldier‘s hand. With the other, he took his helmet off his head. Or rather her head, as all of the remaining witnesses became aware of. The beefy man‘s muscular body had transformed into a rather skinny but awe-inspiring beautiful supermodel with flawless, fair skin, shimmering silky hair, a gorgeous and firm waist, a sultry but cute face and a pair of full, robust breasts. <br />
„Finally I get my burger“, that dream of a young woman said. „For four years you were promising me a cheeseburger. Funny how things turned out.“ The gorgeous girl took a huge bite. „Mmmh. Lovely. You want some, General, Sir?“<br />
Although the professor had never seen her face before, he knew the girl behind it very well. Her transformative abilities had obviously grown considerably. „Margo...“ The professor folded his hands, as if he was preying. „Please. Your wrath is unnecessarily gruesome. It will bring you nothing but even more misery. Those men have done nothing to you. Please, please stop this.“ <br />
„Unnecessary?“. Margo dropped the burger like throwing away trash. „It‘s not unnecessary if I find utmost pleasure in it.“<br />
„You don‘t realize what torment you cause. Those are real, feeling people. They‘re afraid. You‘re taking their lives, and they did nothing to deserve that... that hell you‘re bestowing upon them.“ <br />
Margo stepped closer and the general, the professor and his assistant moved back. „And you still struggle to accept it, dear friend, even after you said it. You know exactly why I love it so much.“ She looked the general deep into the eyes. He seemed already petrified. „I want to own people. I wanna have their lives. I think it makes me feel privileged. But the real thrill is that you‘ll suffer forever, imprisoned in your own mind and there‘s nothing you can do to get back at me, or ever be able to do anything at all.“<br />
„Oh my god!“ The professor‘s assistant made a run for it. But Margo just sighed and flipped her finger at the fleeing woman who had raised her for four years. In the midst of her run, the woman puffed up, flattened and sailed a bit through the air before the silver, sequined mini-dress, which she would for now and forever be, hit the ground. <br />
The professor‘s eyes began to tear. „How could you? She cared about you! She has always treaded you as if you were her own child. You ungrateful...“ He didn‘t dare to talk further. Apparently not to Margo‘s contentment. <br />
„Ungrateful what?“ she asked. „Say it. Or I‘ll say it for you.“ But the professor remained silent, so Margo did as she said. „Monster. That‘s the word that sticks in your throat, isn‘t it? Well, for all I care-.“ And thus the general with his glorious uniform turned black as coal, split into two halves in the middle and shrunk down to Margo‘s feet. The professor gazed down and spotted a pair of black, stylish stiletto heels. He was left speechless. <br />
„Mmh, you guys never allowed me to dress the way I wanted. Always those hospital gowns and straps, tying me onto the bed, itching every night. A machine-gun pointing at my head all day and night in case something went wrong. Can you move this with your mind, can you move that with your mind? And you with your funny, numerous needles. How you kept promising me every time that it wouldn‘t hurt. Well, this won‘t hurt, either. Promised. I‘m even giving you the choice. What do you wanna be for the rest of eternity? Panties or bra?“<br />
„You sadistic bitch.“ The man‘s cheeks trembled with anger. „You belong on the street where we-“ But Margo flicked her hand and turned him into a turd before he could end his insult. <br />
<br />
„You know what, I can get panties and a bra from someone else. I bet you‘ll regret calling me a bitch. That was really, really stupid for such a smart guy like you.“ The girl took off her military boots and slipped into her new heels. The rest of the heavy uniform floated off her body all by itself, while her new, sparkling dress slipped over her and granted her an glamorous look. Before Margo teleported far away from the prison, she addressed the professor one last time. „And I don‘t belong on the street anymore, homeless, helpless, powerless. I belong on top of the foot chain. And that‘s exactly where I‘m gonna be.“</p>
