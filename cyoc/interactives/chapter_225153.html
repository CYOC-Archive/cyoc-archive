<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Illusia thought about her new household. She had to expand the house by a lot, but since she knew magic, it didn&#39;t matter.  It was tough taking care of so many people in diapers, but at least Tina was a big help.  Madame only just wished that Tina would do better in school.  In her heart, she knew that Tina was going to drop out at 16 years of age.  Damon was sound asleep in his plastic race car bed.  His play mat was littered with toy cars.  He was dreaming about the fun he had a Pre-K.  Deborah and Chelsea were upstairs in their nursery asleep in their white cribs.  The walls were painted pink and adorned with cute white bunnies.  Both adult babies had mobiles attached to their cribs.  One with pink and lavender butterflies for Deborah and one that had simple red, white, and black shapes for Chelsea.  A pink teddy bear rested on his side on the floor.  His ear was worn thin where it had been chewed.  In the room beside Deborah&#39;s and Chelsea&#39;s was Jackie&#39;s nursery.  It was decorated in much the same way as Deborah&#39;s and Chelsea&#39;s except it was lavender.  Jackie&#39;s white crib had the same mobile on it as Chelsea&#39;s.  Jackie laid in her crib chortling and twitching her arms and legs uncontrollably.  The feeding pump beside her crib was pumping the nourishment she would need through her nose, down her throat, and into her belly.  Her penis dribbled a little bit of pee into her thirsty diaper.  Paula&#39;s room looked way different.  Even though it was painted pink, it was in a princess theme.  She had a really cute princess themed plastic twin sized bed.  The covers , also princess theme were covered in all kinds of pastel colors and hearts.  Underneath those covers a man with the mind of a five year old girl slept peacefully with her lion plushie under his arms.  She had a toy chest full of wonderful dolls and even had a tall princess castle in the corner that she could use for her dolls.  In Becky and Jamie&#39;s room, the teens were also in their special needs beds for the night.  The beds were effectively large boxes with vinyl mint green mattresses being not even an inch off the floor.  Inside the special needs beds, the walls and ceiling were covered in thick mint green vinyl foam pads so that the girls wouldn&#39;t injure themselves if they hit the walls of the bed.  Nothing covered these girls except the diapers on their butts.  Becky&#39;s diaper, swollen to the brim, leaked urine and feces during the night.  Becky&#39;s belly was smeared in feces as well, but that didn&#39;t bother the sleeping girl.   This room&#39;s walls were mint green colored as well.  A sturdy looking changing table stood against one wall  It&#39;s cabinets stocked full of diapers and other supplies that a diaper dependent retarded teen girl would need.  Tina&#39;s room had black painted walls.  A red painted desk was there, but it was messy.  A red colored lava lamp and a pink Chromebook for school rested on her desk.  The page to her homework assignment was clearly visible and clearly unfinished.  Painted onto the laptop was a girl who was wearing a black skirt stabbing a zombie in the neck.  The knife was clearly stained with red and green blood.  Her queen sized four poster bed was resting on a wine red soft thick carpet.  the comforter was black with red blood stains printed on it.  Under it were wine red satin sheets.  The basement was divided into four rooms and a hall.  None of the rooms had windows.  The first room was nothing more than a place to store stuff.  It contained several wheelchairs and strollers as well as a playpen in addition to other stuff.  The second room was empty except for some equipment.  The walls were painted cream and the floor had a plush red carpet.  On three sides of the room where the ceiling met the walls were very dim LED lights.  On the side with no lighting stood a locked red painted metal cabinet unit.  On either side of the unit were to large tanks bathed in a dim red light.  There was tubing coming out the tanks going to the metal shelving unit the tubing was as tidy as possible.  Inside the tanks, two cocoon like things that wobbled a little every now and then also had tubing connecting them to their respective tank.  There was a white fluid in one of the tubes in each tank that disappeared into the cocoon and the metal cabinet.  If one would look close enough at the cocoon, they might possibly see a faint image of a person curled up in the fetal position.  Except for the occasional spasm, both Jenna and Richard slept mindlessly.  Next to the room with the tanks was yet another room.  It was very bright and had white painted walls.  the carpet was nothing but plastic green AstroTurf.  At one side sat a large kennel big enough for an adult to comfortably turn around stretch out and lay down in.  Inside the kennel were two large dog bowls.  One filled with water that had bits of food floating in it and the other was empty, but had dried up beef stew gravy stuck to the bowl.  The kennel had a plastic mesh so that urine and feces would be able to collect in a pan below the kennel, but would not hurt the animal as it walked across it.  In between the plastic mesh and the pan was the metal cage bottom make of unbreakable wire.    Inside the room were two women.  Monica was on all fours howling while Tina was wearing a black t-shirt with no bra and a short black skirt that didn&#39;t hide her lack of panties or the black double dildo that was in her snatch.  Tina had one hand on the back of Monica while the other hand was holding Monica&#39;s leash which was attached to her harness.  Both adult teen and human dog were panting in the throws of excitement as Tina worked the double dildo and Monica pushed back to also work the thing.  After a while, they both orgasmed leaving Tina in bliss and Monica wondering if she was going to have puppies.  And so, Madame Illusia got her wish.  She wanted a big family and she got one.  Each member in the family minus three were having wonderful dreams about the day they had.  But, tomorrow is a new day and new adventure would begin.</p>
