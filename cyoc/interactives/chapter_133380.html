<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door to the bathroom opened once more, Philip wondered who it was as he heard a strange sound as if something was sliding across the floor. “What could that be it sounds so weird.” he thought to himself.<br />
 <br />
Humming noises could be heard in the bathroom as what sounded like a elderly female singing to herself.<br />
 <br />
“What’s going on?” Philip thought to himself. At the end stall scrapping noises continued as he realised that she was cleaning the stalls.<br />
 <br />
As she worked her way down stopping just short of him, she moved away approaching the sinks cleaning each one before moving onto the large mirror. Philip could only sit back and watch as she applied a sponge and scraper across the mirror, it was already spotless yet began to look that more clear.<br />
 <br />
“I&#39;ve been dreading this” she said to her self turning to face Philip as she approached bringing with her a collection of cleaning supplies. Pulling her toilet brush out and applying bleach to the inside of his bowl and rim, Philip was shocked to realise he could hardly taste it when suddenly he heard.<br />
 <br />
“Bleach Safety Protocol Active”, Philip was perplex was this one of the safety features, “I guess I wouldn’t want to know what pure Bleach tasted like he thought to himself.<br />
 <br />
The elderly lady scrubbed the inside of his bowl as she worked hard to deal with his immense proportions, Philip felt ticklish as the brushes danced across his surface. Moving her attention to his exterior as she wiped it down to his base wiping away any dust they may have settled before cleaning his tank the same way. Wiping down his handle as she flushed away the cleaner and any dirt left behind from earlier in the day.<br />
 <br />
“This is so good…. why does it have to feel so good….” Philip couldn’t believe it, this was the 3rd time he was flushed, he couldn’t get enough. Philip began to realise that without any form of movement or anything to do or watch outside of his users, he was bored yet he awaited each flush, feeling more eager each time. “I don’t think I care…, bring them on I don’t care any more, just flush me..” Philip snapped back and forth as if fighting his natural instincts. “Why do I feel this way, Its as if I’m starting to love being this toilet yet I’m a human being!” Philip continued to struggled as he confronted his depressed feelings. “I’ve been all the jokes, bullied, 2nd rate compared to everyone else the Chronivac gave a job if it wasn’t for Lohse’s help I wouldn’t experience anything like this. Philip was in such a deep thought he had not noticed that the elderly cleaner had already left the bathroom.<br />
 <br />
The door opened once more to several people that made use of the other toilets, “Why won’t you use me, am I too big? just come over here flush me…..” Philip became frantic yet felt tired as he over heard a discussion asking about the time of day as to him he realised he hadn’t been used since the midday as he drifted off to sleep, waking only to the other toilets in use as he remained unused for the rest of the day.<br />
 <br />
It was nearing the end of his first day as the Disability Toilet at Cloudfield Hospital, he awoke to the sound of another voice in his head,<br />
 <br />
“Day complete, preparing revert process” the voice said, waking Philip up to a now dim light outside his window as he realised what time it was. Philip mentally yawned as he noticed what looked like Lohse reappearing once more before him. “Hello, there how was your day, you can speak no one will be coming in here again as they have already locked the bathroom door.” She said with a happy smile on her face.<br />
 <br />
“Well, *gurgle*… as what felt like Philip cleared his throat he found it much more easier than the first time speaking. “Huh, I think I drifted off in the later part of the day, I don’t remember much, outside of being woken up from the other stalls being used”. sounding groggy as if he was still half asleep.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah” said Lohse, “That tends to happen as a inanimate object when your not in use you tend drift off to sleep, I once spent 5 days as a workplace fridge in a building with a cafeteria where employees ate out, I ended up sleeping through almost the entirety of it” she said with a smile.<br />
 <br />
“Anyhow, how was your day, I can see according to my device here you was used once but flushed three times that&#39;s correct including my own doing, yes?” she said examining her device.<br />
 <br />
“Yes, I had a fat bi…” Philip was interrupted as Lohse began to speak once more, “Yes I can see, she was rather large and my what a naughty one she was….. Hmm your exhilaration was quite unpredictable, did you get a orgasm from every time you was flushed?” looking bewildered at this information whilst as she continued to eye over the data.<br />
 <br />
“Yes…” hearing his own embarrassment in his voice.<br />
 <br />
“That’s very rare even considering the safety protocol I was able to give you to cover the bleach during your cleaning, yet uniquely it seems you enjoy being flushed a lot more than our projections would ever estimate” turning her head once again to her device appearing quite happy with the amount of data that had been gathered in the first day.<br />
 <br />
Bringing up the courage, Philip asked “Why is it I feel so happy with being flushed, I started to beg, accept, even want people to use me, I could taste what the first lady did and by the end of it I didn’t care, I just wanted to be flushed, to be used” with a troubled voice as best as he could.<br />
 <br />
“The information you’ve provided us today has given us great insights into people with similar mental structures, as such we have given you a bonus that you can expect in your account once you get home. You should know that this is just apart of your make up, everyone experiences things differently, you craved it as the object you are, you became bored, the sensitivity of your flushes generates a large feedback that empowers your desire more, effectively you was becoming the toilet you transformed into and I’m sure by the end of the week, as it appears this may actually be the perfect job for you.” with a serious expression that had taken Philip back.<br />
 <br />
“What do you mean becoming the toilet, I thought this was a temporarily assignment before the next job” Philip voiced his concerns as he started to feel agitated.<br />
 <br />
“No need to get angry, it is very, very rare that we ever find the perfect job that someone would want to do, it just happens that yours really is as this toilet as a standard toilet would never give this amount of data. Today at this clinic was a uneventful day but I’m sure once more people arri…”<br />
 <br />
“WHAT!” Philip cried out.<br />
 <br />
“Just accept it, stop fighting it its my job to know these things that’s why I turn up twice on the first day and last day to see how our employees are doing and I can tell you right now 100% with this data, you like this position.” she said with a honest look to her face that Philip couldn’t refuse. He was struck back had he really wanted this, he saw through her legs to the large mirror behind her, “Be this toilet, the perfect job…” he thought to himself.<br />
 <br />
“Tomorrow will be a much more busy day, today was unique with the media coverage but you will see a lot more use and I’m certain you will ask me to make this your full time employment when I visit you at the end of the week.” as she eyed Philip confidently.<br />
 <br />
“Remember, the information we gather allows us to create more accurate experiences for someone that chooses their transformation, lets say for example your name is Jeff and you turned yourself into a talking toilet as a prank. Without the information we take from your mental structure we would have no idea from which to generate the correct level of stimulation and experience, now I must go there are many others around this world that need their debriefing, I thank you once more for your data is very valuable for us and if you do make this your full-time employment we will provide a much better salary to ensure continued access to this data” Lohse awaited a reply but knew Philip was in a state of deep thought as she relaxed her composure.<br />
 <br />
Lohse began to fade out of view once more, Philip began to get a tingling feeling across his surface as he felt his form begin to shift once more. As his tank detached from the wall behind him as the water vanished, The top of his head shifting towards his normal form as his lower half began to revert and shrink down back to his normal self, his bowl reverting back as his legs separated once more, as his natural skin colour returned. With a tug he detached from the large pipe as his body finalised back to normal.<br />
 <br />
Philip stood up looking at where he had been all day thinking about what Lohse said as he was returned home once more. Appearing in front of his computer as before, his monitor showed the Chronivac device once again.<br />
 <br />
“Offline mode” it stated as Philip glanced at it, feeling a little hungry He decided to prepare a small dinner he had in his fridge whilst logging into his PC to check his bank account. His account looked healthy as he had received a five figure bonus that Lohse was on about, he smiled yet tried to think of nothing.<br />
 <br />
Leaving the computer in a standby mode, while eating his dinner he tried his best to distract himself from his experiences today, focusing intently before going to bed. As he approached the bathroom he stopped in front of his own toilet, staring inside its bowl blankly, his thoughts utterly empty, as he didn’t want to face what his mind was telling him as he used it. Avoiding even the slightest thought as he brushed his teeth, preparing himself once again for bed, he couldn’t help but finally think about today as he got into his bed after so long of distracting himself.<br />
 <br />
Philip woke to the sound of running water, but there was none just as his alarm clock was going off reminding him about his new day. Having his breakfast like yesterday, he approached his Chronivac once again, still undecided about what Lohse said, dreading the idea of a real busy day.</p>
