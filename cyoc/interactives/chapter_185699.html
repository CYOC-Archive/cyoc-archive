<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cold breeze that slithered up and around Chris&#39;s nether regions reminded him of how small they were. His butt was flatter than a pancake and his 3 incher and marbles got him made fun of a lot in school. Maybe that&#39;s why nobody ever stayed with him... At least with this toy, he could pretend to be the heartthrob he always wanted to be.<br />
First was his butt. His cheeks were flat, and even just sliding your hand past them would push them to the bone. The measurements used were how wide his hips were and a fat and muscle spectrum. Chris didn&#39;t really know what any of it meant, so he just typed in what he thought was big for the hips and fat, while only uping the muscle a little bit.<br />
Next, he went to his penis. He wasn&#39;t really the kind of guy who&#39;d give, instead he&#39;d prefer taking it. But if someone didn&#39;t want do that either, he&#39;d put his preferences aside and please the person. Luckily for Chris, he knew how dick measurements worked. He first gave himself 9 inches, but felt slightly horny and changed it to an entire foot of meat. His girth didn&#39;t change though, and stayed as his pre-planned 6 inches.<br />
Last was his balls. The only good thing with having small testes was that hits to them were missed a lot, but even that was undermined with how much more painful it was. He didn&#39;t really get the ball measurements either, so he eyed the measurements of a small plant pot in his room and expanded his sack to that. He also highered the production of sperm, so his baby makers may have some cushioning in case of another attack.<br />
After everything was set, he went back to the &quot;Apply Reality&quot; button and tapped it with a small sense of excitement<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, this is a bit egotistical, but why would I lie about my sexiness in the first place?&quot; Chris said to no one in particular. He moved his sitting position to lying down so he could scratch his fluffy ass and stretch properly. The relaxed feeling he got made his dick slither through his stomach and under his blazing chest. Despite being one of the most well equipped gay men in the city, with both a smackable twink ass and a tasty stud pole, he was having a bit of a dry spell. Not many men were being totally swooped of the streets and into his sheets as when he moved in, and it made him bored. Online 18+ role-playing helped him out a bit, but he was already doing that. He hoped that he could find a toy to help him out with his body count, an exact measurement of all of his features. Even if it failed and people were too jealous to pound him, he could always use it to spice up his rps.<br />
He felt his smooth morningstars churn and his snake throb for pleasure, so he sat back down and looked out his window as he jerked himself. Many sexy men with their bare ass and cocks walked past the apartment complex, but one interesting sight got some pre to come out.<br />
<br />
He watched as a businessman in a suit attempt to ignore the local male prostitute, Josh, spreading his ass for the world to see, but more specifically for him. Chris called Josh over during his off hours to give him extra cash in exchange for some rough play, but neither of them have mentioned becoming roommates, despite it being on both of their minds.<br />
Josh managed to lure $20 out of the businessman and started to fuck his dick against the alley wall. Chris could still see it play out and was getting really interested. He licked his lips and moved to his cock. He cleaned up all of the pre that was sliding down his sword and started making out with his head. Josh&#39;s ass did the thrusting for the man as he blushed and panted. He came quickly, either because he was in a rush or because he was to easy. Chris wasn&#39;t done yet, however, and sucked himself off while licking his slit. He groped his balls and pulled them high up as to put more meat in his mouth. Josh was cleaning the guy off and looked over to the window and winked, planning everything out for the neighbor next door. Chris noticed this and was so thrilled at the special scene for him that he started cumming. He moaned as his own seed went down his throat and into his belly. Any of it that ricocheted out of his mouth was promptly swept up by his caked tongue.<br />
Eventually, he gave himself a final kiss before letting his wet beast flop down. He patted his balls and sighed orgasmically. Josh recently planned out the new sex spot that wasn&#39;t just basic, out-in-the-open streets. Giving the stud next door his own private seat would have gotten his lengthy baton a full day of pleasure and autofellatio, plus it felt kinky to have a little secret with his neighbor. Life was good for Chris.</p>
