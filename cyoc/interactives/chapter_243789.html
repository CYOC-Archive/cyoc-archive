<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blinding light enveloped the Jacobson family, wrapping them in a cocoon of pulsing energy that made their entire bodies tingle. When it finally dimmed, the family found themselves floating in a strange white cloudy void. Distant colored lights—purple, blue, green, and pink—waved lazily on the horizons like aurora borealis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Dad?&quot; Katie called out, turning her head frantically. Her family was nearby, also suspended in the nothingness, looking as confused as she felt. Then Katie realized with sudden horror that she could see all of her family. Their clothes had vanished completely, leaving them naked and exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; she shrieked, crossing her arms over her flat chest and squeezing her thighs together. Her cheeks burned hot with embarrassment. &quot;Where are our clothes?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah gasped, automatically covering her breasts and privates with her hands. &quot;Harold! Our kids!&quot; Her voice was high and panicky. Katie had never heard her mom sound so frightened before.<br />
<br />
Her father looked equally mortified, cupping his hands over his hairy penis and testicles while trying to maintain some dignity. &quot;Everyone stay calm,&quot; he said, though his voice cracked with anxiety. &quot;This must be some kind of... illusion or... or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like this!&quot; Ben wailed, as his hands covering his prepubescent little member. &quot;Make it stop! I want my dinosaur shirt back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie felt hot tears pricking at her eyes. This wasn&#39;t the adventure she&#39;d wanted. This was weird and scary and wrong. &quot;Elyssa?&quot; she called out, her voice trembling. &quot;Where are you? Please give us our clothes back!&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer came. But the swirling lights on the horizon started pulsing more intensely, sending ripples through the white void.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold, we need to get the children out of here,&quot; Sarah said, as she tried to move toward Ben and Katie. But the void seemed to hold them in place, keeping them separated by several feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I—I can&#39;t move closer,&quot; Sarah said, panic rising in her voice. &quot;Katie, Ben, it&#39;s going to be okay. Just don&#39;t be scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Katie <i>was</i> scared. Right then, she felt a strange tingling sensation spreading across her skin, different from before—more intense, like thousands of tiny bubbles popping all over her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Katie called out. &quot;Something&#39;s happening to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; Ben cried, staring at his arms in horror.<br />
<br />
Katie looked down at her body and gasped. Her skin was changing color, shifting from its normal peachy tone to a soft, bubble-gum pink. Not just her arms, but everywhere—her legs, her belly, her chest—all turning the same shade of bright pink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold!&quot; Sarah&#39;s panicked voice cut through Katie&#39;s shock. &quot;Look at your hands!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie tore her gaze away from her own changing body, to see her parents own transformation. Their skin was shifting color, becoming the same bubblegum pink as hers and Ben&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to us?&quot; Harold asked, his accountant&#39;s mind clearly unable to process that this was all possible.<br />
<br />
The sensation intensified, and Katie watched in fascinated horror as her skin began to take on a different texture—smoother, shinier, almost reflective. It reminded her of the balloon animals at the county fair, how they gleamed under the lights.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel weird,&quot; Ben whimpered. &quot;I feel all... stretchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was right, Katie realized. Her skin didn&#39;t just look like latex—it felt like it too. Smooth and slightly elastic, with none of the little bumps and hairs and imperfections of normal skin. When she pressed her fingers into her arm, they made a slight depression that bounced back when she released the pressure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Katie called again, her voice quavering. &quot;Dad? I&#39;m scared!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here, sweetie,&quot; Sarah reassured her, though her voice was tight with fear. &quot;We&#39;re going through it too. Just stay calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
But staying calm became increasingly difficult as the transformation continued. Katie watched in horror as her fingers began to meld together, the spaces between them filling in with the same pink latex material until her hands became mitten-like, with no separate digits at all. The same was happening to her feet—toes disappearing, leaving behind smooth, featureless appendages.<br />
<br />
&quot;My fingers!&quot; Ben cried out. &quot;They&#39;re gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine too,&quot; Harold said, his voice oddly calm now, as if he&#39;d moved beyond panic into some detached state of observation. &quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt though. Does it hurt anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie had to admit it didn&#39;t. There was no pain, just the strange tingling sensation and a growing warmth that spread through her body. The warmth concentrated in strange places—her chest, her belly, and especially between her legs, where it pulsed with a rhythm that made her feel both embarrassed and weirdly good at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt,&quot; said Katie, reluctantly. &quot;It feels... weird. But not painful.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she spoke, she felt the transformation creeping up her neck toward her face. Her hair receded into her scalp, leaving her completely bald. The pink latex material continued to spread, covering her ears until they merged completely with her head. She could still somehow hear Ben&#39;s frightened whimpers and her mother&#39;s attempts to soothe him—but her ears were gone, leaving only a smooth expanse of pink where they had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair!&quot; Sarah gasped, reaching up to touch her now-bald head. &quot;It&#39;s gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of it,&quot; Harold confirmed. His voice was strangely distorted as the latex began to cover his face. &quot;Everywhere on my body. I&#39;m completely smooth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie realized he was right. All her body hair was gone—not that she had much to begin with at ten years old, but even her eyebrows and eyelashes had vanished. Her entire body was now a uniform pink latex surface, smooth and shiny like a balloon.<br />
<br />
And then came the most terrifying part. The transformation reached her face, covering her features one by one. Her nose flattened and merged with her cheeks, leaving only the slightest bump to indicate where it had been. Her ears vanished completely. Her eyebrows disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; she tried to call out, but as her lips began to seal together, her voice became muffled. &quot;Mmm! MMMM!&quot; <br />
<br />
She tried to scream, but it was no use. Her mouth was gone, leaving only a smooth expanse of pink where her lips had been. Her eyes were the last to go, the latex closing over them like a second eyelid, yet strangely, her vision remained. She could still see everything, her family, the void, the waving colored lights—but her eyes no longer physically existed on her face. <br />
<br />
The changes finished. Where the Jacobson family had been floating, there were now four featureless pink latex beings. Two larger adult forms and two smaller child-sized ones. They had no facial features, no fingers or toes, no hair, no genitals. Nothing but smooth curves and slight indentations where their features had been.<br />
<br />
Katie tried letting out her voice again, but nothing came out. She couldn&#39;t even breathe either, she realized with panic, but then discovered she didn&#39;t need to. Whatever they had become didn&#39;t require oxygen.<br />
<br />
<i>Mom? Dad? Ben?</i> She thought desperately, wondering if they could somehow hear her thoughts. Can anyone hear me?<br />
<br />
There was no response, at least not in words. But she could see the other figures moving, their arms waving in panic, their featureless heads turning this way and that. They were all experiencing the same terror, all trapped in bodies that weren&#39;t their own.<br />
<br />
Katie tried to move toward her family, and found that she could. Whatever force had been holding them apart had vanished, allowing her to drift through the void toward the smallest latex figure—Ben, she assumed. She reached out with her mitten-like hand and touched his arm.<br />
<br />
It felt like a jolt of electricity. Pleasure erupted from the point of contact, spreading through her featureless body like wildfire. It wasn&#39;t like anything she&#39;d felt before. More intense than the tingles she sometimes got during swim class, or when she pressed her pillow between her legs at night. This was overwhelming, all-consuming.<br />
<br />
Ben jerked back, clearly experiencing the same thing. His latex body quivered, and Katie knew that if he still had a face, his eyes would be wide with shock.<br />
<br />
<i>What was that?</i> she wanted to ask, but couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
The two larger latex figures, her parents, drifted closer, their featureless heads tilted in what might have been concern. Sarah reached out, her mitten-hand touching Katie&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Again, that burst of pleasure, so strong it made Katie&#39;s latex body tremble. She could tell her mother felt it too, the adult figure&#39;s body going rigid with surprise.<br />
<br />
Harold moved cautiously toward Sarah, reaching out to touch her arm. When their latex surfaces met, both adult figures shuddered visibly. The sensation was clearly affecting them all the same way.<br />
<br />
Katie felt an overwhelming urge to explore this new sensitivity. She ran her mitten-hands over her own smooth body, feeling bursts of pleasure everywhere she touched. Her chest, her belly, the featureless area between her legs—all of it sent waves of delight coursing through her when touched. It was confusing and wonderful and terrifying all at once.<br />
<br />
She saw Ben doing the same thing, his latex hands gliding over his smooth pink body. Her parents were touching themselves too, their movements were becoming more frantic, more purposeful.<br />
The distant lights pulsed in rhythm with their explorations. The white void around them began to shift, and it seems that there were more strange changes to come….</p>
