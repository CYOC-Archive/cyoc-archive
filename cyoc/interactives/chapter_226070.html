<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is inspired by a story written by LittleBoy but his story is in the Chronivac branch. Mine is in the Magic Shop branch.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was sixteen and so was his best friend Jeremy. It was a Sunday and the two of them were just wandering around with nothing particular to do. They decided to stop at the variety store called Magic just to see if they could find any good deals. Only last week, Jeremy picked up a great deal on a headset.<br />
<br />
They decided to check out the clothing section to see if there were any new t-shirts or hats that might be interesting. Jeff picked up a shirt with a picture of a UFO and the caption said, &quot;Take me with you&quot;. While they discussed whether to buy the shirt or not, they saw Ryan in the store and immediately ducked away hoping Ryan hadn&#39;t seen them.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a bully but he was no dummy. He struggled with academics but he excelled at causing people trouble and getting away with it. He had even managed to give Jeff a black eye once but Jeff couldn&#39;t prove that Ryan had done it. But Ryan seemed to be more interested in the pet supplies aisle and didn&#39;t seem to notice Jeff or Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;I thought Ryan didn&#39;t own any pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Beats me. He probably got a pit bull.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Jeff spoke, he felt something go around his neck and snap. He quickly reached up his hand to find a dog collar around his neck.  Jeremy looked past Jeff with fear in his eyes. Jeff turned around to see Ryan there grinning.<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;I always wanted a pit bull but I think I found something even better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately tried to remove the dog collar but couldn&#39;t get it to unclasp. Jeremy asked, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;I heard a rumor that this obedience collar was magical. First, it&#39;s suppose to force whoever is wearing it to obey my every command. Let&#39;s test that out. Speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Ruff.&quot; He wondered why he said that but he was focused on trying to remove the dog collar.<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;Hate to disappoint you but it looks like that collar is no more magical than any of the other rumored magical items this store is supposed to sell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;Au contraire. The second part of the magic is supposed to alter awareness and reality so that no one notices anything amiss except the one wearing the collar and myself. Didn&#39;t you notice Jeff bark like a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;He always talks like a dog. He is a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Wait, Jeremy, what did you just say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy asked, &quot;What do you mean? I just said you are a dog. That is what you are right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan chimed in, &quot;But Jeff is also human and your friend, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy answered, &quot;Of course. What kind of weird April Fools prank are you playing? Jeff is my friend. He&#39;s a human and he&#39;s a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;This isn&#39;t April Fools and this is no prank. The third part of the magic is that I&#39;m supposed to be able to command dog transformations at will. Let&#39;s test that out. On all fours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly bent down until he was on all fours but he also felt some changes taking place. His pants fell down and Jeff looked back to see that his hind legs had taken the shape of dog&#39;s hind legs and paws. His legs still had human skin, human hair and human toenails but they were shaped for walking on all fours like a dog. Jeff then looked at his arms which had taken the shape of dog&#39;s front legs and paws. His arms still had human skin, human hair and human fingernails but they were shaped for walking on all fours like a dog.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;What are you doing to me? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;You&#39;re going to be my obedient dog from now on. You&#39;ll go on with your regular life acting normal and no one is going to know or be suspicious but you and I will know that you are my dog now. You will obey me and you will only obey me. No one else can control you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;You&#39;re talking crazy. Jeff is not your dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan asked, &quot;Who&#39;s dog is he then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;He doesn&#39;t have an owner. He can do what he wants. He doesn&#39;t have to obey you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan then looked down and noticed Jeff&#39;s boxer trunks. &quot;Let&#39;s see what else has changed.&quot; Ryan grabbed Jeff&#39;s boxer trunks and yanked them down. Jeff reached back to try to pull them up but Ryan said, &quot;Uh, uh, uh. Stand.&quot; Jeff stiffened up into standing on all fours and not moving.<br />
<br />
Ryan asked, &quot;Jeremy, does Jeff have a dog&#39;s butt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;No, he has a human butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan asked, &quot;Does Jeff have a dog&#39;s cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;No, he has a human cock. What are you getting at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan asked, &quot;Should Jeff&#39;s human cock be on display?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;Oh my goodness, Jeff what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I&#39;m standing because Ryan ordered me to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy asked, &quot;But why? You don&#39;t have to obey Ryan. Why are you naked?<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Jeremy, you have to help me. Ryan put a magic dog collar on me. He&#39;s controlling me somehow. The collar really is magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;You both are pranking me. This is some elaborate prank but what if someone sees you Jeff? Quick, put your pants on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just stood on all fours. Ryan said, &quot;See, you won&#39;t obey anyone else&#39;s commands, just mine. Now I am going to test something else. Stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up like a human. His arms and legs also transformed back into normal human arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;Just as I thought. The magic knows what command I mean. When I say stand, it knows whether I mean stand like a dog or stand like a human. Now strip and show your friend your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stripped, put his hands on his head and turned slowly so Jeremy could see every part of him.<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;I just love humiliating you. You may get dressed again. I&#39;ll see you at school.”<br />
<br />
Ryan left. Jeff quickly put his clothes back on.<br />
<br />
Jeremy asked, &quot;What is wrong with you? Why are you obeying Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;You&#39;ve got to help me, Jeremy. Get this collar off me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy tried to remove the collar but it wouldn&#39;t come off. An employee at magic came by and said, &quot;You got to pay for that dog collar now.&quot;</p>
