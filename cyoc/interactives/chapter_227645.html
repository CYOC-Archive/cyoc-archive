<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The teens now looked to one another, a eerie silence growing. Without saying a word they seemed to understood what needed to be done. &quot;We didn&#39;t put in all that practice for nothing,&quot; Winery shrugged. Stepping out of the car, the five teens furrowed their brow at the approaching girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are we doing,&quot; Felicity exclaimed. &quot;Making a stand,&quot; Winery replied, the teen now shifting in form. Felicity watched as Winery grew in size, her muscles increasing as snow white fur covered her body. &quot;Easy for you to say I cant do that,&quot; Felicity exclaimed as she stared at the werewolf. Although Felicity had no affinity to the supernatural, she had to admit Winery was an impressive 7 foot tall werewolf. And a little bit hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Felicity take cover,&quot; Winery growled. &quot;We&#39;ll try and stop her.&quot; Felicity nodded, quickly ducking behind a tree and thankful to be out of the kitsune assassins way. The last thing she needed was to blow her cover. &quot;You,&quot; Winery said, pointing to Lilith. &quot;You said you have magic, time to use it.&quot; Lilith sighed, truely hating activating her powers but realizing she had little choice. In a flash of light, the Solar Guardian Pluto now stood, Pluto staff in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Annie whispered, watching the assassin approach. &quot;Mia and I will hit from a distance. Winery get in close and try to hold her down. Lilith, you&#39;re in a support role. Anyone looks like they&#39;re in trouble, you step in.&quot; Lilith nodded, narrowing her eyes as she gripped her staff. Mia now stepped forward, the witches eyes glowing a brilliant blue as she looked down at her familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get her Rexie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rexie grinned, the tabby cat charging forward as she began to shift in form. The cat now grew larger, her teeth growing longer as she became a powerful white sabretooth cat. Leaping at Hinata, she swiped with her razor sharp claws, trying to sink her fangs into the assassins shoulders. Winery could see Hinata now dodging the attack, taking the opportunity to pounce at her attacker. Claws and fangs now snapped viciously, trying to tear Hinata to pieces.<br />
<br />
Hinata scowled, dodging the vicious attacks before countering. Trying to kill a familiar was nearly impossible and considering the ferocity and skill of this werewolf, she understood it would be no easy task eliminating her. Instead, she now tried to outsmart them. Hinatas opponents were young, seemingly inexperienced. With a simple spell she now caused a pillar of rock to erupt from the ground, slamming into the familiar before useing her skills to toss the massive cat at the werewolf. Luck, it seemed, was on Hinata’s side as the sabretooth tiger collided with the werewolf, sending both careening into a tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rexie! Winery!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie and Mia now raced towards the pair. The attack had happened so fast they barely had time to react. Checking on the pair, they could see Rexie was dazed while Winery was unconscious. &quot;Ugh I just know Winery is going to blame me for this,&quot; Mia groaned. &quot;Um guys she&#39;s still coming,&quot; Lilith exclaimed. Turning, Annie and Mia now watched as Lilith attempted to stop Hinata. The majokko teenager now casting spells with little affect. As Hinata now tried to slash Lilith, the majokko blocked with her staff before being pushed backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap this is not going well,&quot; Annie cursed. &quot;Felicity get Winery to safety and stay out of sight.&quot; Felicity poked her head out, quickly racing to Winery’s side. Thankfully Winery had reverted back to human form, Felicity gripping her under the arms as she dragged her behind the tree. With Winery safe, Annie now used a spell of her own. Channeling her magic through her dual rings, she now attempted to slow down Hinata.<br />
<br />
Homata grimaced as she felt her body go rigid. It felt like she was trying to maneuver in mud. Glancing over at the other two teens, she could see the blonde girl now useing her rings. &quot;Of course,&quot; Hinata thought. &quot;The Pendragon girl possessed two rings. She&#39;s slowed my personal time down to a crawl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata had trained for such an attack. In her early lessons with Captain Cassidy she recalled how the human told her of the disadvantages when fighting magic. A wizard was only limited by their imagination, meaning you would need to be more imaginative. The key to a spell that slowed your body, was to use something that wasn&#39;t attached to your body. This now gave the kitsune an idea.<br />
<br />
Taking a slow motion leap into the air, Hinata now spun, trying to build momentum. As she now released her sword, she smiled, watching it quickly build momentum as it sped towards her attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANNIE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie grunted, her body quivering as she gazed down at her stomach. The attack had come so quickly. She had been so focused on slowing down Hinata that when the girl threw her sword at her, she didn&#39;t have time to react. Instead the katana had pierced her stomach, pinning her to Winery’s car. Spitting up blood, she felt her body go numb as her hands shook from the shock of being impaled.<br />
<br />
With the spell broken, Hinata was back to full speed. Unleashing a ball of fire at Lilith, she sent the majokko teen soaring into the woods like a ragdoll. There was a chance she had killed the goth teen but Hinata doubted it. For now though she was out of the fight, leaving Hinata in a one on one with Mia Hall.<br />
<br />
Mia was panicked, trying to comfort her friend. &quot;You&#39;re going to be okay Annie,&quot; she said quickly. Flashbacks from the war now flooded the witches mind. She remembered wounds like this before. They weren&#39;t immediately lethal but they could be if left untreated. Annie now yelped in pain as the katana exited her body, blood pouring out of the wound as the teen slumped to the forest floor. Mia turned, watching Hinata clean the blood from her blade with a flick of her wrist. &quot;Annie stay here,&quot; she said firmly, grasping Annie&#39;s hands and pressing them against the wound. &quot;Dont pass out and focus on slowing down the bleeding okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie nodded, her lips coated in blood as she stared at Mia with fearful eyes. As Annie&#39;s rings began to glow, Mia could at least breath a sigh of relief. The rings were now slowing down the blood loss to almost nothing, buying them sometime. As she stood, her eyes began to glow, blue lightning arcing off her body as she glared at her friends attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea who you&#39;re dealing with do you,&quot; Mia snarled, gesturing Rexie to her side. Hinata scoffed, finding this girl&#39;s display of power almost comical. &quot;You&#39;re about to learn how big of a mistake you&#39;ve made.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a primal yell, Mia now unleashed her power on Hinata. Blue lightning now arced in every direction, turning trees to splinters, setting the ground ablaze. Hinata, at first, was not impressed. To the seasoned assassin this seemed nothing more than a temper tantrum. When Mia used her magic to hurl an uprooted tree at the kitsune, she scowled before cleaving it in two. It wasn&#39;t until Mia&#39;s spell constricted her body did Hinata begin to take this child seriously.<br />
<br />
Hinata grimaced, feeling the witch grab her with an invisible force. For the kitsune it felt as if a massive invisible hand held her in midair, trying to crush her in its vice like grip. As Mia roared, Hinata now found herself, slammed into different objects as well as the ground. Dazed, she tried to gather her bearings, now useing a spell to free herself.<br />
<br />
Teleporting only feet from the witch, Hinata slashed with her weapon, cursing as the witches familiar defended the blow. Although the witches familiar was injured, Mia continued the attack. For Hinata there was a moment where she could respect this girl&#39;s power. Obviously Hinata had underestimated her, Mia was indeed a powerful witch, she just wasn&#39;t faster than a kitsune.<br />
<br />
With a slash of her blade and a powerful kick, Mia was sent careening into Winery&#39;s car. Bouncing off the vehicle, the witch now crashed to the forest floor, the breath knocked out of her as she bleed from a vicious slash across her torso. Hinata had ended the threat, gazing down at the exhausted witch who was on her hands and knees. &quot;You fought well Mia Hall,&quot; Hinata said softly, raising her sword above her head. &quot;For that, I will grant you a quick death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia winced, awaiting the sword to behead her. Instead, she now saw a fox tail wrap around Hinata’s arms tossing the kitsune back. Glancing up, her eyes grew wide, filling with tears as she gazed at her savior. &quot;Akira?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira furrowed his brow, the five tail kitsune still dressed in his fitted charcoal suit. He had been reviewing security tapes when he sensed Mia was in danger. Instantly transporting to her location, he was able to stop this assassin and save the girl he had sworn an oath to protect. As Hinata now got back to her feet, Akira removed his jacket, withdrawing the katana he had won from Isao from a portal. &quot;You have made a fatal error assassin,&quot; he growled. &quot;You threaten those I have sworn to protect. For that you shall now PAY!&quot;</p>
