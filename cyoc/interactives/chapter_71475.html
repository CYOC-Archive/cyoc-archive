<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They didn't know each other. Nor did either show any inclination that they should know each other. But both Dennis, called Denny by his friends and family, and Olivia, who hated her name and wish her mother had named her something else, were standing next to each other in line when they paid to enter the carnival. <br />
<br />
What both had in common was that each was trying to escape from something in their lives. <br />
<br />
Denny wanted to get away, for the moment, from dealing with his father, who was in hospital dying. His ten-year-old sister Carla, who had recently started acting like a prissy, know-it-all bitch. A mother who'd withdrawn so much that she was only scene at mealtimes. And his own confusing feelings of wanting to be the opposite sex and gender, something that he'd managed to suppress since he'd been about seven, but now was getting harder and harder to do.<br />
<br />
Olivia, besides hating her name, really only had two problems in her life. The first was her parents, who were insisting that Olivia move out and either find a job or start college. The second was that ever since she been a little girl, she had always felt like she'd been born in the wrong body as the wrong sex and gender.<br />
<br />
Both entered the carnival at the same time and for awhile each drifted off to separate areas of the festive grounds, exploring the midway or taking in the rides with really running into each other until they arrived at the house of mirrors. But even then, as both progressed inward, neither gave the each the slightest inclining of having ever seen the other. And what each saw in the house of mirrors filled them with so much awe, that both returned to stare at the mirrors, which depicted their images of various stages of their lives, had they been born the opposite sex and gender.<br />
<br />
Leaving, one after the other, Denny and Olivia once again parted paths and once again took to wandering the carnival grounds, going on rides they hadn't been on, returning to rides they had rode previous and cruising the midway and listening to the barkers hawk their games and prizes. But, subconsciously, each chose to avoid the house of mirrors, which both Danny and Olivia had found interesting that it was called Revelation's Reflection.<br />
<br />
<br />
When they did cross paths again it was when each had started wandering the section set up to sell clothes and other forms of souvenirs. Each wandering under one tent after another, Denny and Olivia eventually came in close proximity of each other when they began looking at the clothes.<br />
<br />
For Denny it was the women's and girl's clothing that drew him. The softness of the fabrics, bright colours and the way they accented the body and allowed for just the right movement. All of that and so much more screamed out to Denny that these were clothes clearly created for the opposite sex and gender. When a vendor approached him, a man that looked of Roma descent, and asked, &quot;Are you looking for anything in particular,&quot; in a think accent, Denny merely shrugged and mumbled, &quot;Just looking. Thought maybe I'd get something for my mother or sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the man replied, &quot;If you need me, just call,&quot; Denny felt once again the feeling of embarrassment and shame creeping over him as he nodded in response and watching the vendor go assist another young woman, Denny contemplated just leaving.<br />
<br />
Browsing the various clothes, not in the least bothered by the fact that what she was looking at was clearly meant for a man, Olivia was startled when a vendor slipped up next to her and asked, &quot;Can I help you with anything?&quot; in such a thick accent she almost didn't recognise what had been said. Glancing at the vendor, she noted that he appeared to be of Roma descent.<br />
<br />
A shrug escaped Olivia and indicating a pair of board shorts, white with a blue Hibiscus pattern, she asked, &quot;How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up the indicated piece of clothing, the vendor flipped over and peered at the tag within. After a moment, he listed a price that was about three dollars cheaper than what was listed. Thinking she was getting a bargain, Olivia glanced about, noticed the teenage boy going through the girl's and woman's clothing, and figures it really was none of her business why he was do that, but that it must be because he planned on purchasing something for a sister, mother or girlfriend, Olivia turned attention elsewhere, spotting a guy's tank-top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get I get one of those as well?&quot; she asked, indicating toward the tank top, figuring she could wear the both as pyjamas.<br />
<br />
Nodding, the vendor asked for what size and after Olivia told him, &quot;Small to medium,&quot; he reached into a box under the table and pulled out a pair of the shorts and from another box one of the tank tops.<br />
<br />
As Olivia was paying for her purchase, Denny kept browsing, the paranoid feeling that the other people in the tent were looking at him and judging him growing. When he came to a table labelled &quot;Five to six years old,&quot; he almost turned away, but than saw the romper.<br />
<br />
Picking it up, liking how soft it was and that it was all one piece with no buttons, zippers or snaps on the front, as some rompers he'd seen had, Denny took in the light pink fabric and the white, light blue and dark pink hearts printed on the fabric. Picking it up, he discovered that it came with a pair of light pink briefs that had the same heart pattern printed on them. Looking at the tag hanging off one arm, Denny noted that he had just enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Found something?&quot; an accented voice asked from behind him and glancing in the direction and seeing the male vendor from before, Denny suddenly wanted to leave, but instead nodded.<br />
<br />
Smiling, the vendor said, &quot;Good. Another happy customer,&quot; and peering at the romper Denny was holding, he reached under the table and pulled from a box the exact same romper, saying, &quot;I am sure your sister is going to love this,&quot; as he did so.<br />
<br />
In response, Denny merely nodded and feeling he should make it more believable that he was getting something for his sister, he hastily pointed at a two-piece Hello Kitty bikini and said, &quot;Can I also get one of those.&quot;<br />
<br />
Collecting it from a different box, the vendor politely asked, &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Denny, glancing about briefly, wanting more and more to leave, shook his head. Following the vendor over to a table, Denny wondered what he was going to do with the clothes, as he figured there was no way they would fit him. When the vendor listed a price, Denny hardly paid any attention and just handed over the money, unaware that he'd just been charged less than what he though he would be.<br />
<br />
Both taking their bagged purchases, Olivia and Denny each exited the tent of clothes and souvenirs. Once again, they went their separate ways, taking one final look at the rides and midway before exiting the carnival. Heading home, each wondered about their purchase and only Olivia felt really comfortable about what she'd bought. But, in the end, each decided that what they really wanted to do was try on the clothes they'd bought when they got home, with only Olivia wondering if she should wait until later but deciding that when she got home would be good enough.</p>
