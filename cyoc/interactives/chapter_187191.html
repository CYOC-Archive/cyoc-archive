<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gerald was the biggest bully in the whole school. He bullied class nerds every day and usually flushed their heads into toilet. Or sometimes he just beat them or stole their money. Today he was wandering around the locker rooms and tried to open locks with a screwdriver. There was nobody around and Gerry was kind of annoyed as he badly wanted to humilite someone. Suddenly he spotted the note on the ground. First he thought that it is folded greenback, but as he grabbed and unfolded it he realized that it is some stupid quiz. He groaned and punched one of the locker rooms with his big fist and bended the door. He sat down to a nearby chair totally bored. Then he looked at the quiz again. Maybe he could kill some time until a class ends and then some nerds will arrive to the locker room. Cool... He took the pen he stole from one boy in the morning and checked firt question.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
What the fuck is this quiz about? I don&#39;t wanna be a girl at all. It is kinda gay stuff. He wanted to throw it away but then looked at it once again. He recalled hours of playing computer games like Tomb Raider or Syberia or Half-Life 2 when he played for women characters just for fun and because he could stare at their swaying hips from the 3rd person view. Maybe it could be fun to imagine some playable woman character. He began to write.<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, it wouldn&#39;t be important for me. It could be neat when I focus on it, but most of time it would be messy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
&quot;Not at all. I hate this fucking barbie color as well as girly girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
&quot;Straight and almost always in plait.&quot; He wrote. He had naturally longer hair so he didn&#39;t realize that his hair got longer and rearranged to plait on his back.<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
&quot;Green, brown or black. Generally darker tones of colors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
Gerry thought for a while. He always preferred girls with dark hair so he wrote &quot;Dark brown or almost black.&quot; He didn&#39;t realize that his blonde hair darkened and become thicker.<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
Gerry had always thing for blue eyes. Combination of black hair and blue eyes almost gave him a boner. So he wrote it down.<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like makeup?<br />
&quot;Not very much. Just some dark eyeshadows and dark lipstick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?<br />
Gerry smiled. He loved sporty girls. Especially in sports where they showed their assets so he could admire them.<br />
&quot;Yes, I would sport a lot. But mainly no teamsports. Solitary activities like rock-climbing, swimming, shooting, archery and sometimes mud-wrestling.&quot; He laughed when he wondered about how sexy two girls in shorts and covered by mud are.<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
&quot;Just in extraordinary situations - high ladies&#39; boots to be sexy chick. But otherwise I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?<br />
&quot;Again - not usually. Just in rare occasions with high boots. And it will be leather motorcycle miniskirt everytime.<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
&quot;Not exactly jewelry, but I would have piercings in my eyebrows, ears and chin.&quot; He suddenly felt sharp pain in his face. He started to wave his palms around his face: &quot;Fuck! Some fuckin&#39; bees had to sting me! Ouch! Nevermind! I am not a pussy. Bee sting wouldn&#39;t kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
&quot;I would be wearing just a army camo backpack with my sports clothing, trench knife and 9mm beretta pistol for self-defense.&quot; Gerry didn&#39;t realize that army backpack formed behind him. So he continued to next answer.<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
Gerry imagined how pretty are all those gamer girls and how great big boobs look on them and wrote almost without hesitation &quot;Firm 38D breasts.&quot; He was shocked when almost immediately his chest got heavier with every inhale. He gasped and observed two huge mounds protruding from his chest. His T-shirt stretched to it&#39;s maximum and Gerry could clearly see two erected nipples. He got boobs! Gigantic heavy boobs! He grabbed these alien mounds and was horrified about the new sensations he was feeling from the area. &quot;What the fuck! I must be dreaming!&quot; He pinched his nipple and sharp pain ran through his body. He blinked several times. &quot;Ouch! Fuck that hurts like a punch into my nuts! What is happening? It is not a dream, but...how? Magic doesn&#39;t exist, or does it?&quot; He caressed his boobs again and slowly. His whole body was shivering and he felt his penis erecting. &quot;Fuck! This stupid quiz changed me to some shemale! I have to stop it or something worse happens!&quot; He was ready to tore the paper to pieces, but suddenly weird text appeared: &quot;DON&#39;T STOP NOW OR YOU WILL BE STUCK LIKE THIS AND YOU WILL BE PUNISHED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY!&quot; Gerry was scared. He took the pen again and read the next question.<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
Oh. He was still shivering but this question is easy. If he has to spend some time as a girl he would be 100% lesbian. His computer was full of lesbian porn as the imagination of girl on girl aroused him everytime he was watching it. Girls eating each other, kissing, scissoring or fucking one another with strap-on. Yes...maybe he could take some advantages on this situation if it is temporary. So he wrote: &quot;No, I would be attracted to girls only, especially biker girls or tough girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
&quot;Yes, I think that girl should be shaven. But my hair would grow slowly so I don&#39;t have to shave too often.&quot; With a weird itching all his body hair disappeared.<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
Weird. The vision of his own crotch in girl underwear was odd for him. He wrote the less feminine underwear - boxers. He felt almost immediately how his shorts changed, but his body also chamger to fill new women boxer shorts. His hips widened and his butt expanded so his jeans also stretched on his full ass. Gerry was breathless.<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
Oh fuck. This is really happening. Point of no return. If he needs such a female hygiene, he would also have to change his gender. He deeply inhaled and hesitated again. He could still discard the quiz...but he was also scared about the punisment and that he will be stuck as big breasted shemale. After a while he wrote &quot;Pads&quot; as he wasn&#39;t ready to stick something like tampon inside his body. Almost immediately he felt how his penis retracted itself followed by testes. He gasped as something new formed in his groin. He unbuttoned his stretched jeans and touched the area. It felt weird. There wasn&#39;t his dick anymore. He could feel just clearly shaven slit. Weird feeling in his belly - probably as organs rearranged forming uterus, womb and ovaries. It is true. He has a vagina. Fuckin&#39; pussy in his crotch. He tried to slide inside with two fingers and felt stronch sensation. His nipples erected again and Gerry felt wet warmness spreading from his crotch. But not for long. He also felt numb pain. As he pulled his fingers out from his new pussy he could see that these are covered with blood. &quot;Nooo, fuck no! I don&#39;t wanna experience period! This sucks!&quot; But in a second cotton pad formed in his boxers giving him at least feeling of lightness as it hugged his privates. &quot;Great! I am bleeding like a girl...&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
Gerry hesitated for a moment. He didn&#39;t wanna be dumb, but also didn&#39;t like too smart geek girls. He wanted to be smart enought to live simple but independent life. So he wrote 6. He felt new informations getting into his brain as he wasn&#39;t very intelligent in his former life.<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
&quot;Simple sports bra.&quot; Gerry felt as unfamiliar piece of clothing slid across his boobs lifting them up. He breathed a sigh of relief as heavy weight disappeared. He felt much better now, but he still regreted that he wrote down such an extraordinary size of tits. But he has to accept it - at least for now. <br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don&#39;t lie)<br />
I’d be 21 years old (so I can drink alcohol legally), about 5’8” and would weigh 145 Lb.<br />
Gerry felt weird sensation again as his body rearranged. He lost some inches, but still remained quite tall. His belly slimmed down in comparison with his hips and boobs. His legs shaped to be more feminine as well as his hands. He lost most from his muscles but still had well sporty figure with small bicepses. His body got well shaped sporty appearance (except his big bouncing tits). &quot;At least I am still strong.&quot; He tried to punch into air with his smaller fists but it still felt effective despite the fact, that his boobs jiggled much more. <br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
Gerry touched his hair that were already a bit longer and in a plait. It felt familiar as he was used to wear longer hair even as a male. But could it be longer? It would look really sexy. &quot;My hair would be to my mid-back, but always in ponytail or plait. Sometime pigtails.&quot; he felt itching of his scalp as his hair growed longer.<br />
<br />
Question 22: If you were a girl ... what would your name be?<br />
Gerry thought for a moment. Gizelle would be good. It sounds interesting and still kind of related to his old name.<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl ...how would you sound?<br />
Gizelle wrote &quot;Sultry and mellodic.&quot; and immediately tried it: &quot;Hi, I am Giz. Are you interested in some girl on girl action, babe?&quot; It really sounded very sexy. And the last question.<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl...what would you be wearing right now?<br />
Ok, here we go. Final question and maybe after this all changes can be undone. &quot;I would be wearing camo shorts showing a bit of my sexy butt, black undershirt with open cleavage, leather jacket and army boots.&quot; His clothes changed to match his answers. He really looked sexy. Maybe it is not so bad to experience a bit from woman world. Then he felt cramps in his belly. &quot;Fuck. Almost forgot this fucking menstruation stuff.&quot; So he tried to wrote. &quot;How can I undo the changes and change back to man now?&quot; After a while words appeared: &quot;All the changes are final and couldn&#39;t be undone. But if you want to live a happy life as a girl, toss this questionare to another person - man or woman doesn&#39;t matter. Enjoy your new life Gizelle.&quot; Gerry felt devastated. So he is stuck like this for the rest of his life. Stuck with huge tits and moist  vagina bleeding every month. Tears formed in his eyes but he wiped them with his hand: &quot;Nope. No crying. I am not a pussy. I am sexy lesbian and I am gonna find benefits of womanhood. First one is that I can sneak into girls showers anytime without their suspicion.&quot; He smiled. Gerry folded the paper and threw it to some random locker. He left the school and when he was walking down the staircase realizing the weight on his chest with every step, somebody whistled to him: &quot;Heeeey Giz! Look sexy today!&quot; in luscious voice. He turned around to see redhead girl with moderate breasts and stunning body in leather motorcycle outfit. She was wearing two helmets and threw one to former man. &quot;Wanna take a ride?&quot; she asked backhandy. And then she whistled to his ear: &quot;I know that you&#39;re in your bloody season - I am as well. But we can still have some cuddling and groping these knockers. She squeezed one of his breast and he felt sudden arousal and heat in his vagina. Maybe being a girl is not so bad. The former school bully realized.</p>
