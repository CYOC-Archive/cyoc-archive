<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen had finished her homework and both girls had reverted back to their non-magical girl forms by supper time. There was a little conversation about Jen's day at school and how Allison's flight was ans if she was enjoying London so far. Then Charlene said &quot;I'm curious about something. You said you were cursed. Why didn't you try to get it removed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of reasons&quot; Allison said. &quot;One is that I've always wondered what it was like to be a girl and I was one now. The other is that I've heard mixing magics can have some undesirable results. I didn't want to find out what would happen if I did mix magics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you a magical girl then?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's part of the curse I guess&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How were you cursed?&quot; Andrew asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found my necklace on the ground about two weeks ago&quot; Allison said. &quot;I thought someone had dropped it since it was so unusual being a fossil on a chain. As soon as I picked it up pain raced through my body. I didn't know that I was changing until the pain stopped and I was left as a twelve year old girl. Shortly after I met a witch that told me I was cursed by Kitsune magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was Kitsune magic either Keiko or Akira could undo it&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think they could&quot; Andrew said. &quot;It may be a permanent change like mine and Jen's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok anyway&quot; Allison said. &quot;I like being a girl. It's a curse I can live with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene smiled and said &quot;Well I'm happy you find joy in this. There was a time after I was transformed that I wasn't happy. I thought that I was going to lose Andrew before Keiko gave him the option of becoming who he is now.&quot; Both of them smiled at each other and held hands. &quot;Now we're going to have another baby&quot; Charlene continued. &quot;I couldn't be happier than I am right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Charlene said. &quot;Now I'm curious about something else. How much of your schooling do you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's tough to explain&quot; Allison said. &quot;I remember it all but I can't put it to use. Like I know about the Pythagorean Theorem but I can't solve any problem with it. It's like I have all of my knowledge from before I was transformed but I can't access beyond that of a twelve year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words you need schooling&quot; Andrew said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll need to enroll you in a school then&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I have to go away to school?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we can figure out a way for you to stay here&quot; Charlene said. &quot;That is if you want to stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of supper went by discussing where Allison could go to school that would enable her to be at home every night. Later, Andrew put a cot in Jen's room and Charlene brought in blankets and pillows. As Charlene was making up the cot she said &quot;We'll go get you a bed tomorrow Allison. You'll have to make do with this cot for tonight though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said. &quot;I can handle a cot for one night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Jen and Allison had already changed into their pajamas and they slid between the covers. As soon as they were tucked in Charlene said &quot;Goodnight girls. Sleep tight.&quot; She then kissed both of them on the forehead and left.<br />
<br />
During the night Allison started mumbling in her sleep. Quite suddenly she bolted into a sitting position and shouted &quot;NO! MOM! DAD! DON'T GO! PLEASE DON'T GO! COME BACK! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was more than enough to bring Charlene and Andrew running into the room. Charlene hugged Allison as she started to cry freely. &quot;Get it all out&quot; Charlene said tears leaking from her own eyes. &quot;I'm here for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're gone&quot; Allison said through her sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it all out and you'll feel better&quot; Charlene said. &quot;You tried to be a brave girl by not crying didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn't be crying like this&quot; Allison said. &quot;I know that the body is just a shell and that they're ok spiritually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's natural to be sad and cry&quot; Charlene said. &quot;You're twelve again and you had to depend on them again. That made you even closer to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss them so much&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you do&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
Neither of them said anything else and soon Allison was asleep again. The rest of the night went without any incidents.<br />
<br />
The next day at school during lunch Jen asked Marry if she could come over. She said that she would if she could. Jen accepted that and tried to decide if she should surprise her with the transformation. She wanted it to be a surprise but she was afraid that she would alienate Marry by doing that. That was why she didn't turn any of her friends into magical girls. She was afraid of losing all her friends. Allison coming to live with her and being a magical girl too gave her the push she needed to try this.<br />
<br />
Jen was happy to learn that Marry would be able to come over since it was Friday. She could even stay the night if she wanted to. Later Jen and Marry had finished their homework and were talking. At first it was just small talk about school ad their teachers but it soon turned to what Jen really wanted to talk about. It was Marry who brought it up by saying &quot;You're so lucky Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get to be a fox girl now&quot; Marry said. &quot;I want to be a fox girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a way that you can be like a fox girl&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Marry asked looking excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold onto my necklace with me&quot; Jen said taking her necklace off and holding it out to Marry. Marry took it and Jen said &quot;This is you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The necklace glowed between their hands and it spread over Marry. Her features shifted subtly making her cuter than she was before. The glow faded and when she withdrew her hand she had a necklace in her own hand. It looked like Jen's but the jewel was green. Marry looked at it and then her reflection in the mirror. &quot;I'm not a fox girl&quot; she complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try transforming&quot; Allison said from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Both Jen and Marry jumped and Jen said &quot;I thought you were with Mum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was&quot; Allison said. &quot;We found a bed and Uncle Andrew is bringing it in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been there?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long enough to see you transform your friend&quot; Allison said. &quot;Are you going to tell me who she is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry&quot; Jen said. &quot;Marry, this is my cousin Allison who used to be my cousin Rick. Allison, this is Marry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Marry&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here&quot; Marry said. &quot;How do I transform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold your necklace and say 'Mystic Girl Power!'&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
Marry was already holding her necklace so she said &quot;Mystic Girl Power!&quot; Her necklace glowed green and it spread over her body. Her ears moved up to the top of her head and became triangular. Her shirt changed color from red to green while her shorts became a green skirt. Green knee high boots and green elbow length gloves. Finally two tails burst from above her butt. She looked at herself in the mirror and said &quot;Close enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel great&quot; Marry said. &quot;I'm kind of a fox girl now. Though why am I wearing green?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just the color of your costume&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
At that moment Andrew came in carrying a box. He took one look at Marry and said &quot;Another magical girl. You could start a club with you three.&quot; He didn't say anything else but began setting up the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should transform back&quot; Allison said. &quot;They don't like us transforming without a reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I do that?&quot; Marry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say 'Hidden Power!'&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
Marry said that and she became her human self. &quot;Well what do we do now?&quot; she asked.</p>
