<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean said I got this tub of lard to take care of. How can I take care of you too.<br />
<br />
Jay looked down and but I really want to get fat.<br />
<br />
Well your just going to have to wait.<br />
<br />
Jay grabbed his jacket and headed out to a buffet to stuff his woes. For several hours he sat there. Plate <br />
after plate filling his stretching belly. When he finally got up his pants were unbuttoned. His pants would <br />
have fallen off if he hadn't had the belt still buckled at it's last notch. He dropped a tip on the table and <br />
got in his car and headed to a bar.<br />
<br />
He sat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of beer. As he looked at the mirror on the wall behind the bar he saw <br />
a guy that looked familiar looking at him. As he worked himself around the guy in the mirror was gone. He <br />
looked around the bar and didn't see him. Jay finished off that beer and then was on to another. After his <br />
third beer he looked into that mirror again and there he was. Where have I seen him Jay thought to himself. <br />
Then it hit him. He was at the buffet he was just at. Searching his memory he remembered seeing him at several <br />
of his stuffing events. Maybe it was just the beer talking. Maybe he was just hallucinating. But this was <br />
about the only clear idea that was working it's way through his head with all this beer in him. Jay turned <br />
around again and the guy was gone. Jay was on to his fifth pitcher and then off to the bathroom looking for <br />
his stalker along the way but nothing.<br />
<br />
When he returned to the bar and got several more pitchers he saw the guy several more times but it was his <br />
10th pitcher that Jay felt an arm go around him. How are you doing big guy. It was his stalker.<br />
<br />
Who are you?<br />
<br />
A friend.<br />
<br />
I don't know you.<br />
<br />
But I know you. I have been watching you for awhile.<br />
<br />
That is just creepy.<br />
<br />
But I can tell you are excited about it too.<br />
<br />
Jay felt himself getting more and more excited as he was talking to this guy. But he wasn't going to admit it.<br />
<br />
Jay was about finished with this pitcher and the man said here let me get the next one for you. He went down <br />
to the end of the counter and ordered another pitcher and brought it back.<br />
<br />
I don't want your beer.<br />
<br />
Aw come on it's already been poured. Jay wasn't thinking too clearly and let it set there as they chatted <br />
more. Absentmindedly Jay eventually picked up the pitcher and began to drink. All that beer had been soaking <br />
up the alcohol but for some reason this beer really was going to his head.<br />
<br />
Here let me take you home. The man said to Jay. They left the man holding up his drunk hunk and sat him down <br />
in the passenger seat of Jay's car. He got in and started off. When Jay woke up he was hanging in a sling in a <br />
darkened room. he was firmly secured so that he couldn't get out but his movements did make the sling swing a <br />
bit.<br />
<br />
Hey let me out of here. Jay screamed.<br />
<br />
His belly was painfully stuffed from the events of that night and he could see the tiny mound rising between <br />
his legs.<br />
<br />
I know what you really want.<br />
<br />
WHAT!<br />
<br />
You want to get as fat as your roommate.<br />
<br />
No I don't.<br />
<br />
Don't you? You have been stuffing yourself. You were doing it tonight and you have been doing it for weeks.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I want to get fat. I was just hungry.<br />
<br />
Does it? As this chat commenced the man was circling Jay like a predator eyeing his prey. When he got down <br />
between Jay's legs he moved in close. Hey hey hey I'm not gay. <br />
<br />
Doesn't matter you are going to accept everything I do to you and do it willingly.<br />
<br />
NO I'M NOT!<br />
<br />
The man grabbed something hanging from the ceiling. It looked like a large rubber penis. Was that what a dildo <br />
looked like Jay thought to himself. Hey Hey Hey that ain't going in me. <br />
<br />
Oh yes it is. Right now you might not want it but you are going to crave it later.<br />
<br />
I WILL NEVER WANT THAT!<br />
<br />
The man spread something on Jay's butt cheeks and poked a finger in to lube him inside. He worked the dildo <br />
into Jay's ass and snapped some straps onto it to keep it inside and secure.<br />
<br />
Feel good? The man asked.<br />
<br />
NO GET IT OUT!<br />
<br />
Oh well maybe you need a little lubrication to make it feel better. The man reached up and got a hose and <br />
attached it to the end of the dildo. When it was secured He turned a lever and a pressure started to fill his <br />
abdomen. There you go the man said doesn't that feel good.<br />
<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
Liquid lard is now filling your abdomen. The man was kneading Jay's abdomen working the liquid deep inside of <br />
him. <br />
<br />
Stop it that hurts. There were tears coming to Jay's eyes. He abdomen was painfully bloated and the man turned <br />
the lever so that the flow stopped. <br />
<br />
You are enjoying this aren't you?<br />
<br />
NO!<br />
<br />
This says yes. The man grabbed hold of Jay's penis that was now hidden by the bloated abdomen.<br />
<br />
Stop that!<br />
<br />
The man complied as he worked the liquid deep inside of Jay. When it was beginning to feel better and the <br />
sweat beads stopped flowing down Jay's forehead the man reached up and turned the lever and more flowed into <br />
Jay.<br />
<br />
STOP!<br />
<br />
Several minutes later the man stopped the flow and said there you go. And left the room turning off the light <br />
leaving Jay painfully bloated and in the dark.<br />
<br />
Jay was excited by this but he wasn't going to tell this guy that this was his fantasy to be kidnapped and <br />
fattened up. His mind swam all night long from pain to ecstasy.<br />
<br />
When the morning came the man came into the room switched on the lights and with very little ceremony pulled <br />
the dildo out of Jay and the flow began to shoot out his ass. All that liquid lard and the meals from last <br />
night were flowing on the floor. The stench was horrific. The man stood next to him in hip waders pressing on <br />
Jay's abdomen working every last bit out of him. <br />
<br />
Jay felt so empty.<br />
<br />
Stop this please Jay pleaded with the man.<br />
<br />
He just smiled through that thick black beard. Open up.<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
I said open up.<br />
<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
I need to test your capacity so open your mouth.<br />
<br />
Jay clamped down his jaw and was not going to open for anything.<br />
<br />
The man squeezed Jay's nose tight and when Jay took a breath a block went inside Jay's mouth making it <br />
impossible for him to close his jaw.<br />
<br />
There now that wasn't so hard was it. It was like he was talking to a child.<br />
<br />
The man started feeding a hose down Jay's throat. Helping it with a bit of water on the sides of it causing <br />
Jay's swallowing reflex to help with the process. When it seemed like miles of hose were fed into his throat <br />
the man stopped and turned on a lever. Similar to the one that had filled his ass the night before.<br />
<br />
I know you can't talk right now but you probably are wondering what this is. It's a mixture of weight gain, <br />
lard and other nutrients and we are going to see how full you can get. I have an estimate from the amount that <br />
you downed last night but we are going to push that a bit.<br />
<br />
Past the hose Jay could see his stomach rounding out. That empty feeling soon left him to be replaced with an <br />
over stuffed feeling that he had never had before. His cock stood to attention and as the beads of sweat began <br />
to form on his forehead his cock spurted forth for the first time ever from feeding.<br />
<br />
The man turned off the lever and headed out as Jay passed out with the hose down his throat and having had the <br />
most exciting sexual experience he had ever had.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sean pulled up Jay's profile and started reading the events of the night. His adjustments to Jay and to the <br />
man who was now a feeder, formerly a biker leather stud. Had really worked. All the bikers and dominant <br />
personality had worked well in dominating Jay. And although now a lot of weight had been added to Jay his circumference was now twice what it had ever been and he was excited.</p>
