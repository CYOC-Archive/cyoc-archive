<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake washed the pile of dishes on Katie's sink, vacuum-cleaned the Malteser-strewn floor and dusted - Katie for her part largely looked on; her gaze was flirtatious, even hungry as it kept straying to his package. Jake was finding a lot of things challenging at five inches flaccid - he was overfilling his boxers now, with the result that his cockhead kept slapping against his thigh as he moved, giving him odd little bursts of stimulation that made a very healthy bulge in his jogging bottoms; he tried to play it as cool as possible, remembering that as far as Katie was to know he'd always been this size.<br />
<br />
Katie, however, made no moves - Jake wondered whether she was reserving judgement until she was able to match him against Josh. Surely she wouldn't literally have them submit to a penis-measuring contest? And what if he lost? Would his enhancement have been in vain? He found himself wondering whether he shouldn't have gone even larger - ensured that absolutely no-one could compare. He couldn't upgrade himself again for another 16 hours; Liz and Josh would be here in four.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang as Jake was putting the final touches to a meringue and Katie was in the bathroom getting washed and dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute!&quot; Jake put the dessert down on the sideboard and rushed to the door.<br />
<br />
Liz was an attractive brunette - heavier around the waist than Katie but if anything larger in the chest and hips. Her features were a little too sharp for Jake's tastes, though. Next to her ... Jake looked up and tried to suppress a gulp. Josh had to be close to 6' 6'' and built, with broad shoulders and a heavy upper body that betrayed a weightlifting regimen. Jake allowed himself a brief glance downwards - Josh was wearing cargo pants that could have hidden a draft excluder. Of course, that's probably what you would wear if you were hung like an elephant, he thought gloomily.<br />
<br />
The conversation was light and mundane as Jake served a pastry dish and vegetables in gravy, but Jake kept catching glances between Katie and Liz. They'd clearly agreed something over the phone - Josh, on the other hand, seemed perfectly clueless, making only cursory contributions to the conversation and spending most of his time eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was lovely,&quot; remarked Katie to Liz after they had polished off the meringue - &quot;my compliments to the chef. Look, it's only eight o'clock - why don't you and Josh stay and we can play a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
The game turned out to be a tabletop number Katie had obviously picked up from a charity shop - slightly worn, it alternated 'bets', 'favours' and 'dares', and the game started fairly predictably, with Jake and Josh being gentlemen and asking for kisses, salacious gossip, and the like, and Katie and Liz extorting various promises of housework. Katie sprung the trap just as Jake reached the home strait and landed on 'Dare'.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you ten spaces,&quot; she said, &quot;that you're not packing more in your trousers than Josh here.&quot; She fixed Liz with a determined glare, which she returned. Jesus, thought Jake, she's actually serious about having us compare.<br />
<br />
Ten spaces would take Jake from first to last place and send Katie over the finish line. &quot;Looks like we have a winner,&quot; Josh joked, and Jake realised he was getting annoyed in spite of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh chuckled. &quot;Come on dude, you're like half my size. You really want to play wee-wee comparison?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, THIS is getting interesting,&quot; interjected Liz, resting her large melons on her folded arms and leaning forward. Not to be outdone, Katie adjusted her d&eacute;colletage for a spectacular display from her higher, firmer pair. Jake found himself already getting hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm willing if you are,&quot; Jake responded combatively. He suddenly remembered what had happened to the over-hung kid at the mall who had humiliated him and reached for the watch.<br />
<br />
The greyed-out display showing his own 7.5 incher faded away when he pointed the watch in Josh's direction; instead, a new size appeared. 8.1 inches. Jesus, he thought, he really does have a huge one. He pretended to fumble around his waistband as Katie and Liz declared their need for a measuring device and went off to find a ruler.<br />
<br />
What should he do? He could hardly reduce Josh to micropenis territory in front of Liz - they'd been together long enough that he couldn't imagine that she hadn't seen him naked on numerous occasions. However, he thought, he didn't need to go that far. He thumbed the 'v' symbol and watched the number decrease. 8.0, 7.8, 7.6, 7.4. There. They would be equal now; surely no need to go further? But as he watched he allowed himself to shave a little more off Josh's vital statistic; 7.3, 7.1. 7.0. He pressed 'ADJUST'.<br />
<br />
Josh frowned, obviously experiencing a lesser version of the cold, unpleasant vice-like feeling that Jake had experienced when he had accidentally reduced himself to near-androgyne status.<br />
<br />
Katie and Liz had returned, and whatever compact had passed between them had clearly come to fruition as they giggled and nudged each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, boys,&quot; asked Liz - &quot;who's first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would have to be me,&quot; said Josh, and Jake couldn't be sure whether he was confident in his superior physique, worried by the pang he had felt in his genitals and wanted to get it over with, or whether he had simply misunderstood the question and thought she was simply restating the question of who was bigger. They stripped him from the neck downwards, revealing an intimidatingly solid frame with defined pectorals and considerable biceps. His waist was taut but bulky, a combination of eating habits picked up from the zaftig Liz and daily crunches. He was more hirsuite than Jake too - a dusting of blond hair covered his chest, forearms and trailed from his bellybutton down.<br />
<br />
Liz was left to do the honours and unveiled Josh's equipment - the cargo pants and shorts slid down to reveal one, two, three - four very respectable inches of flaccid meat, crowned with a significant thatch of blond pubic hair Jake looked on, trying not to appear over-fascinated by the other man's penis. Some of the bravado seemed to have gone out of Josh's face as he looked down, frowning. The watch had obviously reduced his flaccid size too, thought Jake - maybe he was five inches too before; or even bigger. His frown relaxed a little as Liz coaxed his member to life with one hand and it swelled dramatically. It rose - 120 degrees, 90 degrees, then kept going, lifting up a little further to around 70 degrees, his pelvic muscles holding the reduced weight at a perkier angle. There the swelling stopped, despite Liz's best efforts, including kissing its rosy, circumcised head. Josh seemed perturbed - he kept opening his mouth as if to say something then thought better of it.<br />
<br />
For all that it was still generous in terms of length, Josh's member was no longer more than a fraction of an inch thicker than the average - and the same for his testes. If anything his shaft looked a little too slim for his frame. But it was length the girls seemed interested in measuring, and Katie obligingly pressed the tip of the tape measure into the slight paunch above his pubic hair while Liz drew it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven inches,&quot; she declared. Again, an alarmed look passed over Josh's face, but he said nothing yet. Admirable self-control, thought Jake, given that he's lost over an inch. You can't tell me he's never measured that thing.<br />
<br />
Next he submitted to the girls' ministrations - Katie slipped his jacket and T-shirt over his slim frame and for a moment he stood topless, feeling like an adolescent next to Josh. Then Liz peeled down his jogging bottoms and cooed as she saw the impressive curve of meat filling his briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me do the honours,&quot; warned Katie, guiding her rival away as she gently extricated his member and applied the tape measure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five and a half inches FLACCID,&quot; she declared in awed tones.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be a valid measurement. He's already half hard!&quot; - Josh finally found his voice. Jake looked back impassively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Katie, archly, leaning in and resting her cheek against Jake's cock with a mischievous grin. That was enough to get him all the way hard and he watched it ease out to its full length - a glance in the mirror showed a slender, boyish young man with a big, thick dick being admired by two luscious women. This time Liz rested the end of the tape measure against Jake's pelvic bone and Katie drew it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven and a half going on eight. Looks like we do have a winner!&quot; proclaimed Katie, which Jake took as a signal to begin re-robing.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but that's not right,&quot; Josh stuttered. &quot;I'm way bigger than seven inches. I'm, like, nine.&quot; Bit of an exaggeration there, mate, thought Jake.<br />
<br />
Liz's expression had soured a little. &quot;Hun, you're nowhere near that big. Seven inches isn't bad - it's quite big. Most guys would be very happy with that. You're just second to Jake.&quot; As if to signify her seal of approval on the competition, she walked back over to the all-but-forgotten game and moved Jake's token forward ten pages, over the finishing line, and Katie's back ten paces so Josh's token was lapping her. But she's won, thought Jake. She beat Liz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Josh, i think we're through for the night. Maybe you'd like to pop back to Liz's place?&quot; said Katie abruptly. Jake momentarily wondered whether both women had agreed to stay with the winner, but Liz left too, looking distinctly disappointed.<br />
<br />
No sooner had the door closed on Liz and a hastily redressed Josh than Katie pounced, pinning him to the sofa, large firm breasts dangling above his head. She was biting her lower lip hard as she reached for his sizeable erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're so good,&quot; she whispered, &quot;so big.&quot; She stripped off her blouse and bra - Jake caught a flash of the size, 36E - and lowered herself until her pillowy mounds straddled his cock. With a hand on each breast she gently squeezed, smooth, soft flesh sliding over his sensitive foreskin. None of Jake's previous girlfriends had ever done anything like this - Jake couldn't be sure whether it would have always felt this amazing or if his increased size came with more nerve endings, but he was overwhelmed. One thing's for sure, he was able to think through the haze, this simply wouldn't have been possible at 5.5 inches. Katie was able to slide his penis through the full length of her plump cleavage, pumping it as he leaked precum. Finally, he closed his eyes and yelped as his enlarged balls discharged a gout of thick, sticky semen. And another. And another. Katie seemed to be in heaven, leaning back and rubbing his spectacular discharge into her chest.<br />
<br />
To Jake's surprise his reverie was broken minutes later as his penis roared back into life. Katie's eyes lit up as she dragged him into the bedroom and unrolled a condom on his sizeable equipment. It was labelled 'standard' and Jake complained that it pinched around his girth, prompting squeals of delight from his girlfriend. How could I have missed that she was such a size queen?, thought Jake. She had some difficulty engulfing him with her slight, trimmed pussy - she took his first four inches then had to spend the next few minutes teasing her nipples and clitoris until she was ready to take him at his thickest. The head went in last with a satisfying gulp. She slid up and down on him, eyes glazed. Jake was able to prolong the climax for what seemed like a lifetime - but which was probably no more than fifteen minutes - until she shuddered violently, pushing him over the edge. They fell asleep shortly afterwards, exhausted by their exertions, with Jake dreaming of what more he might be able to do with the watch.</p>
