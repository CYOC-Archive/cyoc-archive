<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    For now you weren&#39;t quite sure what your end goal was. Heck, you weren&#39;t even sure if you had one. What you did know was that you wanted to expand your army. <br />
<br />
        You get off your purple wolf and waving your wand tell them your next command<br />
 &quot;Alright, both of you will follow me to my home, follow me with stealth and if any human other than myself spots you then corrupt them if you are able to without attracting more attention, if all else fails return to these woods and wait near where I originally found you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
     The latex wolf and cat nod in understanding and wait for you to start moving. <br />
<br />
     You turn away from them and start going down the street to the direction of your house. For now you didn&#39;t have anywhere you could properly House them, but you figured your house would be sufficient for now. You make your way through the town, doing your best to not attract any attention as you walk. Thankfully today was a quiet day and the streets were empty save for a few hobos and a couple of pedestrians. <br />
<br />
       Taking a quick look behind you, you don&#39;t manage to spot either of your latex beasts anywhere at all, giving you some relief.<br />
<br />
     You face forward again and in about a half hour later you enter your familiar neighbor hood. A few parties were going on but you ignored them and made your way through to your front lawn of your two story house which you had inherited from your dead grand uncle who had sadly passed away several years ago.<br />
<br />
       You rifle through your pockets and pull out your key to the front door when you hear a noise inside of your home. You put your keys away and listen more quietly. Inside you heard voices, not ones you were too familiar with either.<br />
<br />
     A faint voice inside whispers &quot;Alright, I searched around the master bedroom, I found some old jewelry and a bit of cash, still didn&#39;t find the safe though, keep searching.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;I haven&#39;t found anything exciting yet, but I gotta ask. When do you think the owner of this place is coming back? It&#39;s getting pretty late.&quot; Another voice says, noticeably younger sounding than the first.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Relax, it&#39;s a Saturday, whoever lives here is probably partying it up, be quiet though, just in case if someone does come.&quot; The older voice says in a reassuring tone.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Your heartbeat increases as you listen to their conversation. Normally you would&#39;ve called the cops, but now you had power. That power came in the form of two half man half animal beasts who you saw hiding together in nearby bush.<br />
<br />
      You equip your wand and motion them to come out quietly. The two beasts nod and stealthly both rise from their hiding place and join you.<br />
<br />
        In a barely audible voice you say to both of them &quot;There are two people inside of my house. Sneak inside and capture them, don&#39;t corrupt them however and wait for me to enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
   They both nod and both went in separate directions around the house, both of them easily jumping over your fence and making their way into the backyard without making a sound. <br />
<br />
         Moving quietly, you peak through a gap of one of your windows into the living room. Inside you saw a fat squat man wearing a roughly made ski mask and black clothing proceeding to quietly dump everything of value in your house into a large plastic bag. <br />
<br />
       Behind him you see the shiny latex reflection of your blue cat crawl through a open window which had been originally been opened by the robbers and make his way up to the fat man. <br />
<br />
            The fat robber seemed to be in his old years and out of shape as you can see him breath heavily as he continues trying to rob you. He was just about to grab a small pocket watch on a table when suddenly, like a panther, your latex cat wraps his shiny sky blue paws around the man&#39;s face and proceeds to wrestle with him.<br />
<br />
      The man tries to scream and resist capture, moving around erratically and blindly knocking down everything near him, but your cat proves to be much more physically stronger and throws the man to the ground, causing a large noise as the man&#39;s weight hits the wooden floor.<br />
<br />
     Coming out of another room, the second robber, someone who seems to be in his late teens watches in surprise and horror as he watches his accomplice trying to wrestle with a large latex cat man.<br />
<br />
     The teen pulls out a kitchen knife out of his pocket and was about to try and strike at your cat when, behind him, your wolf man claws at the teen from behind, causing several gashes on his back, Causing the robber to drop his knife and scream in pain. The wolf wraps one of his shiny arms around the teen&#39;s body and holds down his hands and arms. The teen barely puts up a fight and is nearly knocked out when the wolf gives him a harsh smack to the face, warning him to quit moving or else.<br />
<br />
         Your cat eventually managed to restrain the remaining robber as well and both wait patiently in the dark for your arrival.<br />
<br />
     In excitement you unlock the door to your house, lock it behind you and enter the living room. The two robbers see you in confusion and both scream &quot;Help! Please! Help us!&quot; loudly.<br />
<br />
    You cringe at their noise and grabbing some duck tape, proceed to tape their mouths shut.<br />
<br />
      You completely cover your windows and look back at the would be robbers and grin. <br />
<br />
      You go up to the older robber who looks scared out of his mind and pull off the duct tape. <br />
<br />
      He gasps heavily as your pull off the tape  and you swear you can almost hear his heartbeat pounding in his chest. You almost felt bad for him and certainly didn&#39;t want him to die of fear.<br />
<br />
  Stepping back you say &quot;Now, I know for a fact that you two were trying to rob me, so speak up and I might let you go.&quot; <br />
<br />
    The robber responds immediately in a begging tone &quot;Oh god, we&#39;re so sorry! Please don&#39;t kill us, times plate desperate out there, for the longest time our family had been wasting all our money on drugs and women. We want to make a new start but we don&#39;t have anything. We didn&#39;t do it because of personal reasons, please, you can call the cops but please don&#39;t kill us!&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;I see. Well I suppose I can understand why you went at such desperate lengths, don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t kill you, but you both will still have to pay,&quot;<br />
<br />
     The man&#39;s eyes widen though you can see he has calmed down a bit. The teenager still looks scared and you can see several tears start to drop from his eyes. Whether they are tears of regret or not you couldn&#39;t tell.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Do you know what these fine young creature that caught you are?&quot; You question.<br />
<br />
   &quot;N-no sir. Aren&#39;t these just some guys in costumes?&quot; He answers submissively.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Alright then, that&#39;s good. Tell me both of your names.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;My name is Johnathon, the other one is my nephew Thomas.&quot; The man answers.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Good to see your being cooperative. Now what did you guys intend to steal from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Just anything that seemed valueable sir. Money, jewelry, stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;Alright then, here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;m not going to kill either of you, nor turn you into the police. However you guys will owe me. You both are going to become my... servants shall we say? If you try and rebel, I can&#39;t say that you won&#39;t be hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
      You raise your wand and give a command to both of your monsters.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Let them go, make sure to cover all exits, if they try to escape or hurt me then you have my permission to either kill or corrupt them.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The beasts nod and carelessly drop both robbers to the ground. The wolf and cat proceed to move to the corners of the room, making sure to block every available exit.<br />
<br />
    The two robbers go on their hands and knees and both start sobbing heavily. You can hear both of them saying words of apology but you can&#39;t make anything out through their cries.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Both of you, take off your duct tape and stand up straight.&quot; You order. They both quickly stand up, Thomas taking off his duct tape and looking at you with a frightened look.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Now, both of you, strip off all of your clothes, say a word about it and I&#39;ll do something worse. <br />
<br />
    Both robbers comply and strip down completely naked, taking off their ski masks and letting you see their faces completely.<br />
Thomas was a old teen, nearly at adulthood with a small growing beard on his chin and a large amount of acne. His body was dirty and messy and even from where you stood, you could smell his musty stinky sweat. Johnathon was like Thomas but worse, he had a nearly balding head, was really overweight and smelt as if he didn&#39;t know the meaning of showering and as if he spent most of his time around pigs.<br />
<br />
     Both of their dicks were both an average size with Thomas&#39;s being slightly larger in both length and girth. <br />
<br />
     Your nearly gag and pinch your nose to block off their smell.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Oh sweet Jesus Christ. Have you two never learned how to shower? I don&#39;t even want to imagine how your teeth must look. It&#39;s clear that you two need someone in charge to lead you. That&#39;ll be me, now prepare to change for the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
         You hold out you wand and concentrate, aiming at Johnathon, you shoot a burst of brown latex goo at him. Johnathon tries to scream but only makes things worse as the latex begin entering his mouth. He struggles as the latex starts covering his body, shaping it into a new form. In a matter of seconds, Johnathon is completely covered in the goo, with Thomas watching in pure horror. In the last seconds of the change, Johnathon&#39;s hands become thick brown paws, he becomes bulky and more muscular and his face turns into that of a large hulking bear.<br />
<br />
    The new brown latex bear looks around at the room until it&#39;s eyes rest on you. The bear nods and moves to the corner of the room. The wolf and cat give a nod of approval at their new member and continue blocking the exits like before.<br />
<br />
    Thomas looks at the latex bear that was his Uncle and for a second it looks like he wanted to scream.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Don&#39;t worry Thomas, you&#39;all be in good hands with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Thomas holds up his hands and yells &quot;Wait! Please no! I don&#39;t want to be like that! I don&#39;t want to be some shiny animal man for the rest of my life! Please I&#39;ll do anything.&quot; Thomas yells begging for mercy.<br />
<br />
    &quot;What can you possibly do that would make me not want to corrupt you?&quot; You ask, almost laughing at his desperation.<br />
<br />
      Thomas goes silent as he tries to think of an answer, but nothing comes out of his mouth at all.<br />
<br />
   You give a large sigh and say &quot;Thomas, you have no money, no clothes, if I don&#39;t corrupt you then chances are you&#39;ll go to jail for who knows how long, I&#39;m reasonably sure this sign the first illegal thing you&#39;ve done and if you go to jail, that&#39;ll all come back to bite you. If you want I&#39;ll use your favorite color. Just hurry up and join me.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Thomas looks down at himself and after several long moments, he mumbles &quot;Red.&quot;<br />
<br />
       You nod and using your wands, shoot a blast of red latex at Thomas. Like the other transformations, this one is quick, as the goo covers every part of him and forms bright red scales, a pair of wings, and white horns. Thomas had become a red latex dragon.<br />
<br />
         The Dragon looks at you nodding, and then stands with it&#39;s brethern.<br />
<br />
  You give another sigh as your work had just finished. You Point at your now larger army and say &quot;Alright, for now this is our base of operations, as of now there are only five of us and we will need a bigger and larger base. For now if you guys require food I have some in the kitchen. If anyone comes into this house invited do you best to hide unless I say so. For now, make sure to not be spotted by neighbors and treat this house as if it was your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
      The latex creatures nod and proceed to go explore the house, individually. In the meantime you start cleaning up the mess Thomas and Johnathon had made while thinking of your next move.</p>
