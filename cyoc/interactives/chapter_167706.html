<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their ship landed just outside the city limits of LA, on the other side of the interstate highway.<br />
<br />
Immediately people came to investigate and after eye witness accounts confirmed what it was the military stepped in and formed a perimeter.<br />
<br />
At first, the military thought it was some secret Russian prototype till it was pointed out it had no obvious propulsion and was the size of an oil tanker, after it was determined that this was an alien ship of some sort was around the time Air Force 1 landed in LA.<br />
<br />
Both the President and the Secretary of State had arrived, the president wished to be there for first contact and brought the Secretary along on this potential first in the history of the earth; diplomatic relations with an alien species.<br />
<br />
An opening manifested on the underbelly of the vessel and a fire pole formed from this hole (and when I say manifested and formed I mean it, the video shows both coming from nothing) and down said pole was the first sight of these creatures.<br />
<br />
They were small, only around 3 feet tall with a spindly tube-like body a neon orange in color, their hands and feet each ending in three fingers/toes that end in suction cups, they stood on their toes, their legs being digitigrade, by contrast, their arms appeared to lack any joints at all, rather being tentacles with hands.<br />
<br />
Their head was teardrop-shaped with a rounded head with a small muzzle, their eyes were large proportional to their head and a solid blue lacking both pupils and sclera, on the top of their head was a pair of antenna, the creature had neither ears nor a nose. They had no neck, or one could say they had no shoulders.<br />
<br />
Aside from their mouth the only other opening they seemed to have was at the end of their tail, which connected seamlessly to their lube-like body which bent backward behind them as the only transition of the body to the tail, at the end of the tail was a small orifice.<br />
<br />
The creature was unarmed and also lacked any form of clothing (not that there was anything to hide) the creature introduced itself as Sen, and it’s species as the Kimasi, Sen explained that they were to represent the Kimasi race in the proceeding diplomacy that was to occur.<br />
<br />
The event was held later that day in a conference hall in LA, while the media wasn’t supposed to be there, the meeting was joined by several dozen reporters from every news station with the exception of FOX (who thought the whole thing was an elaborate hoax.)<br />
<br />
“We wish to share our advanced technology and our way of life with your people.” Said Sen at the conference, “With that in mind we have a proposal, you may study our ships and the data logs onboard, in exchange for letting the 50,000 Kimasi both on the ground and in orbit immigrate into your country, additionally, we wish for a patch of land upon which we may build a city and that this city be treated as an embassy, under your jurisdiction, but subject to Kimasi law.”<br />
<br />
After a bit of negotiation, it was decided that a chunk of federal land in the Nevada desert about twice the size of Vegas and LA combined would be handed over to the Kimasi to build their city, and the Secretary of State would provide all the necessary documents for the Kimasi immigration.<br />
<br />
After negotiations were over the media had many questions and Sen many answers, but one thing stuck out.<br />
<br />
“Yes, any human is open to join us in our city, so long as they are willing to follow our laws.” When asked how their laws differ Sen replied, “Our laws are pretty lax, in fact, we only have one, everyone must be biologically under 10 Kimasi years, or five of your Earth years.”<br />
<br />
Sen then explained that the Kimasi had advanced to the point of having absolute control over biology, using this power, they advanced at an unprecedented rate, till they found themselves with no jobs not already done by machines, since none of them needed to work, and they were all just playing games at this point anyway, they decided to regress themselves into children.<br />
<br />
When asked about violent crime, Sen explained that for them, death wasn’t a big deal, if you died then you would be resurrected at the hospital, death was more an annoyance then anything.<br />
<br />
After most realized they were essentially talking to a five-year-old, they decided against asking about sexual assault.<br />
<br />
That was two months ago, and Kimasi City has just finished construction and now open for both visitation and for permanent stay within its borders, although everyone who goes there as tourists generally decide on a permanent stay.<br />
<br />
Within the borders of Kimasi City, there is no concept of money, if you want something you just ask for it, the Kimasi themselves don’t have genders, as they explain it, they are all birthed from birthing pods and don’t require such things.<br />
<br />
All Kimasi go by very simple names: Di, Gi, Sen, Len, Fen, Ti, Len, etc, as it turns out, these are all single characters in the Kimasi language, as such, its not uncommon to meet two Kimasi with the same name, in these cases you identify them by their colors, such as Orange Sen and Green Sen.<br />
<br />
Sen informed everyone on live television of one final thing about the city, whether you’re visiting or staying, you must decide on a partial or total conversion.<br />
<br />
In order to explain it, Sen brought in a mother and daughter, both of which they explained would be staying in Kimasi City.<br />
<br />
“First, could you two introduce yourselves?”<br />
<br />
“Susan.” The mother said, she appeared to be in her thirties from the looks of things.<br />
<br />
“I’m Katie and I’m four.” The little girl said, holding four fingers out as Sen giggled.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s start with Susan, for this, I’ll show a partial conversion.” Sen then had Susan lift her shirt, just enough to show her belly button and then stuck their tail into it, Susan began to shrink, getting shorter and chubbier as she regressed, her pants and panties fell to the floor as her regression ended her blouse now the only thing keeping her decent.<br />
<br />
Susan for her part stuck her hand under her blouse and was feeling around under it, “There’s nothing between the cheeks…”<br />
<br />
“A partial conversion means we regress you to five, and rewire your digestive system so you no longer need to eat, both intestines have been erased, and the stomach has been altered so instead of processing food, it disintegrates it,” Sen explained.<br />
<br />
Sen then began to lift Sarah’s blouse causing her face to turn beat red and for her to cover her bits, only for her feel around down there and remove her hands to show there was nothing down there to hide.<br />
<br />
“Since your too young for it, we also remove the sexual organs, and the bladder is rebuilt so that it converts everything in it back into usable material for your body, as I’ve said before, we have achieved total control over biology, all of these are features of the Kimasi body with just the addition we no longer need to breathe, we’d give you that too but the way we do it makes it impossible to breathe in and thus your nose is rather useless, it’s why we have the antenna.”<br />
<br />
Sen then went over to Katie, who was watching with fascination while finger-combing her brown hair, “Next I’ll use Katie here to show a total conversion.” As Sen said that the hole in their tail opened wide before swallowing Katie whole.<br />
<br />
At first, it looked like Katie was struggling until the sound of moaning was heard from inside, Katie eventually tired herself out rubbing up against the walls of the tail and went relaxed into the fetal position and was squeezed into Sen’s torso, As Katie moved up Sen’s torso her body seemed to lose its shape becoming a perfect sphere as it reached Sen’s head where Sen then spit out the three-foot diameter pure white sphere.<br />
<br />
This egg then disintegrated revealing a neon yellow snake-like creature, exactly identical to Sen with the exception of coloration and the lack of limbs, the Kimasi lifted its head to reveal that it had a head of neon green hair, the same color as her eyes, in the same style as Katie’s old hair.<br />
<br />
“To help differentiate between naturally born Kimasi and converted humans, all converted humans will keep their hair when converted, doesn’t mean they will keep it if they are changed some other way or purposefully get rid of it with their tail, we can’t really stop them from doing that.” Sen explained, “Total conversion means becoming a full Kimasi and all that entails, no pun intended, a Kimasi is defined by their tail which they can use to manipulate both their own body and the bodies of others.”<br />
<br />
Katie then touched the tail to her sides, each time creating a tentacle limb giving her four tentacles she used to climb onto Sarah and wrapping herself around Sarah like a scarf, Susan for her part looked into her daughters new solid green eyes as the new Kimasi sneakily stuck their tail to the back of her head.<br />
<br />
“Hopscotch.” Susan said and immediately looked confused. “Dancing pickle water game, forest master magic kitten.” Susan said, Sen and Katie giggling like schoolgirls.<br />
<br />
“We can also do that, we can rewire the brain however we like, the result is we can change how you think in a lot of ways, here Katie has just scrambled Susans language center, meaning when she hears or speaks one word, it comes out as a different one, we can also do similar to your instincts, personality, and general knowledge, the only thing we can’t affect is personal memories, that was a specific limit put on us by the original species we were created from.” Sen explained.<br />
<br />
In just under a week, Kimasi City went from a population of only 50000 Kimasi to well over 1 million humans and an almost equal number of Kimasi. Pet’s and animals that are brought into the city are also made biologically 5 years old in their years when brought in as well as converted into anthropomorphic forms of equal intelligence to humans.<br />
<br />
A few things noticed by those who&#39;ve been to the city.<br />
<br />
1 The Kimasi aren’t all like Sen, Sen is the exception, most of the Kimasi are immature to an extreme, pranks, playground games, and general children things abound, all with a transformative touch added.<br />
2 the Kimasi body plan is extremely varied, they are less a species and more bioengineered children, the only consistant trend with them is they have the tail.<br />
3 While the Kimasi are a race of children, they are masters of biology and can create new creatures on the fly, what they can’t do is make a living creature into a non-living thing, if they turn you into an inanimate object, it will be a living, inanimate object, whether that be a plant or a blob of pink flesh, or something else entirely.</p>
