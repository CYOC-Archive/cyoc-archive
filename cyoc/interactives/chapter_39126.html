<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A nice straightforward switch seemed the best way go about trying out being a man with a penis. From Jay's modification of Chris's fathers he was sure that Jay wouldn't think there was anything wrong with that. This plan had the added advantage that if he decided that he liked having a cock it would mean he could just stay that way and if it was just a fun one time thing he'd change back with Jay none the wiser and no disagreements.<br />
<br />
First he had to decide on what sort of member to have. Looking at Jay's profile he concluded that larger would be what Jay thought was better. Certainly though he'd only had sex once so far Jay's considerable member had been quite good and he should probably return the favor or even a bit more. So he moved around sliders until his cock would be a bit larger than even Jay's, 10 inches long and about as thick as a European soft drink can when hard and of course he wanted a foreskin. He set up the emitter and transformed himself.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately he got an erection. He marveled at the sensation as he played with his new equipment rapidly working himself up to ejaculation. Leaning back naked in the chair, he'd yet to put on clothes the whole time he'd been alive, he was both happy and a bit disappointed. It was a sharp and wonderful release, but it had lacked the drawn out intensity of the pleasure of being fucked the previous day. He also felt drained, realizing that he needed to up his sexual stamina so when Jay came home he'd be ready for one or many more. So after a few more changes his testicle each swelled to the size of a golf ball and then he set about creating a transformation for his lover based on his own previous form.<br />
<br />
Jay arrived home with something troubling him.  Something off about what he had done the day before with Sean and Dan's son. This was because reality had been adjusted by the Chronivac so that when Chris made himself male Jay remembered having sex with him as a homosexual encounter. As he got near his bedroom he felt something and the vague sense of a problem going away.<br />
<br />
Entering his bedroom he found the handsome Chris lounging, naked, on the bed. The sight of the physically 18-year-old man's erect penis sent a tingle though his vagina and everything seemed all right again because he could fool himself into thinking of their pairing as heterosexual even though he still had the same massively built body that would put most body builders to shame. Unaware he had never had sex as a woman he started stripping off his sensibly boring office clothes while grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've thought about you a lot today. I want that big cock inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris replied playfully, &quot;That's good, because I'd love to have my cock inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once stripped as naked as Chris he jumped into bed. He had a moment of trepidation as Chris's cockhead started filling his entrance but soon the bigger man was enjoying his ride upon the substantial cock, his pussy filled just to the point where it was pleasurably overfull. For his part Chris was enjoying this much more than his masturbation earlier in the day, after only a few moments he could not hold back his cum. <br />
<br />
Fortunately the increased stamina Chris had given himself allowed Jay to keep ridding giving his lover a second orgasm flooding his man pussy with even more seed and he was finally rewarded by his own huge orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, that was so good,&quot; Jay said lying on top of Chris. <br />
<br />
His partner was enjoying the sensation of being pinned by Jay's larger weight as his cock slowly softened when he asked a very leading question, &quot;Do you like being a pussyman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's an interesting question. Uhhh... Well. I think I like it a lot more than I did. I always wanted to be a full man, with a dick. And, well, don't tell your dads this, but I transformed Sean to having a pussy like me because he'd teased me about it so much. But seeing how much fun he was having and then you... Well, while I think I'd still like to try having a cock I think unless it is really great I'd rather be a pussyman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris thinks about this and...</p>
