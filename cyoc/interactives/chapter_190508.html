<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you entered into the room designated for being transformed, you were a bit nervous. The scientists tried to reassure you that while this is a first for someone wanting to be a custom fly, it likely would not go wrong. They legally couldn&#39;t say to be 100% certain, but it practically was that, according to her. This is what finally pushed you to step inside the room with your wife.<br />
<br />
It was a large room, about the size of your living room back home, trippled. Definitely big enough for several people to become large animals like rhinos if their ever were a need for them to become them. But it was overkill for a pair of house flys. You both were given an injection, then watched as a green gass filled the room. The gas was the reagent, while the injection had the specifications on how to change the person.<br />
<br />
You both were naked, as a precaution for when you were to shrink down, so any changes were immediatly noticed. It began when your waist started shrinking because your body fat was being redistributed over your body. Mainly in 2 specific areas. It was odd that part of the procedure involved you growing a pair of maybe G cup breasts, which definitely shocked your wife when she saw how much larger your breasts were in comparison to her own, who were starting to shrink away.<br />
<br />
Whatever body mass melted fromnyour body, your wife seemed to suddenly gain, as she developed a great muscular buikd, while you slimmed and shrunk down to an attractive feminine body size, albeit one that is a bit hypersexualized due to a know side effect within the gender changing drug. It explained your wife&#39;s new 14 inch long dick, and why the slightest touch to your breasts would cause milk to stream out of them. And definitely why you both couldn&#39;t look away from each other&#39;s crotch. <br />
<br />
It was only a matter of time before your wife picked you up and impaled you onto her cock, which you even helped her accomplish, by lining yourself up properly before she slamed you down. No one said not to fuck mid transformation, so you felt it may be alright to do. You were so horny anyways, so you couldn&#39;t even say no when your wife initiated. <br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe turning up that setting was a bit of a mistake?&#39; You thought for half a second, but immediately shoved that thought away. Who cares, you have a really big dick inside of your pussy, why wouldn&#39;t you want this amazing cock pounding you all the time? It definitely was the drug talking now, but you agreed with what it was saying, so...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is when things went VERY wrong. It began when your feet, which you had wrapped around your wife&#39;s waist, cramped and reshaped into hands, then a pair of arms burst out from your sides about half way between your normal set of arms and reshaped leg arms. Having 6 arms now, you held onto your wife&#39;s body much easier. She then underwent the same process, and now was standing on a pair of hands attached to arms that were once her legs. 2 sets of arms now were feeling you up. 1 hand per boob, and 1 hand per ass cheek.<br />
<br />
Your mouths then became circular in shape, as they narrowed down into tubes, becoming probisci. That was basically the end to kissing, in a sense. However now you suddenly could taste her entire body. Anywhere you placed a hand, you could taste. <br />
<br />
She then came inside of you. You also came and now were heavily leaking the cum mixture from your pussy. But to hell if that stopped your rampant fucking. If anything that only sped you up as you began pistoning up and down on her shaft in order to orgasm again. <br />
<br />
So far, everything was progressing at an ok amount, but then it happened. Suddenly you felt 2 pressures building up within you. At first they were fine and could be ignored, but then a minute later, you were full of concern. Both of your breasts ached. Something inside was desperately trying to escape. You begged your wife to squeeze them and she did. <br />
<br />
To both of your horror, your nipples widened considerably as a pair of round, white, objects pushed out of them. And once the first were out, it was too late. More and more began pushing out, spraying copious amounts of breast milk every time they exited your nipples. You were laying your eggs through your tits! <br />
<br />
What was once an unbearable pressure instantly had flipped to become an endless stream of pleasure for you. It was durring this time when your shoulder blades tore through your skin and a nearly transparent set of wings grew down your back. The same happened for Samantha too, save for the egg laying.<br />
<br />
She rotated you around and dropped to the floor, as you changed positions. Now she was mounting you while your twin baby makers pushed out more and more of your eggs while hanging beneath you. It was amazing! You never felt euphoria like this before. <br />
<br />
It was at this moment the green gas was sucked out of the room and men in hazmat suits ruahed inside. For the first time, you finally hear the loud blaring of an alarm and noticed the red flashing lights. Something was definitely wrong. Samantha unmounted you, and moved to stand beside you on her 6 hands. You too were already standing like that, just like a pair of flies.<br />
<br />
You noticed that your head hair was now very long and turned a dark black with a bit of oily looking, dark green highlights. No body hair either, which was different than what you were expecting since aren&#39;t flys are supposed to be hairy?<br />
<br />
Then someone important approached the two of you. A small pile of golf ball sized eggs still was forming beneath each of your boobs, but that was apparently of less concern at the moment. The person then knelt down and had a grim expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something here, has gone horribly wrong. The two of you should be tiny by now. And your legs should not be shaped like human arms and hands. Why you are laying eggs from your breasts is also a mystery. And how your penis became so large is concerning. <br />
<br />
You look over at the said &quot;large penis&quot; and go wode eyed. That, that thing was about the thickness of a coffee can! Somehow that monster had fit inside of you with room to spare! <br />
<br />
You could only agree, something definitely was not right here. And part of it was how much you wanted, maybe even needed, that thing back inside of your pussy asap.</p>
