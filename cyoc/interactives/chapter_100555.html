<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She had sent her young son along to the gym to try and build up his confidence a little bit. Get him out from behind a computer screen and doing something a bit more active instead. Maybe in time he&#39;d even join a sport team and start attracting some real friends rather than the guys he played games with online or the school bullies who saw him as easy prey.<br />
<br />
When he hadn&#39;t returned home after a few hours she started to worry. He never usually left the house, let alone stay out later than he needed to. Perhaps she&#39;d pushed him too far. He had been too timid, as always to really fight back when she had suggested the gym but she knew he didn&#39;t like it. His tiny shoulders had been tensed up from the moment they entered to when she waved him goodbye as he left with a muscular personal trainer to begin his first workout.<br />
<br />
What if he&#39;d seriously injured himself? What if some of the other boys had started giving him grief? Now she was back at the gym to find her son and take him safely back home.<br />
<br />
When she asked at reception if they had seen Sean, the girl behind the counter just seemed to giggle. The man next to her just  looked at her cluelessly like she had no right to be asking after her own son. Close to desperation now and with tears in her eyes, the staff members were obviously a little freaked out. They both just indicated to a man standing behind her who was chatting up a big chested girl in a tight top.<br />
<br />
The man they&#39;d pointed to had big beefy arms which were toned, tanned and bulging without effort. They were connected to broad shoulders and massive, bulging pecs which sat over a washboard stomach also in full display as he had chosen to go shirtless and show off his body in its full glory. Craning her head up because the man was easily several inches taller she noticed something in his face and froze. It was Sean. His hair was blond, wavy and shorter now, he looked almost 20 instead of 14 and had a dazzling Hollywood smile but there was no way his own mother couldn&#39;t have recognised him still. His face may have been much more tan and masculine looking with a sharper jaw, stronger nose and lots of dark stubble but something in those innocent blue eyes still gave him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young stud in front of her noticed her for the first time and suddenly paused in the midst of his conversation with the girl next to him. When he spoke back it didn’t sound anything like Sean&#39;s usual soft, high pitched voice. It was deep, confident and full of disdain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the words hit her, she suddenly felt a rush of blood go to her head and the world paused for a second. Then everything around her started spinning. Sean, the bimbo he&#39;d been flirting with, the staff behind the counter, the gym. She closed her eyes to try and make it stop.<br />
<br />
When she awoke she was back in her bedroom. It seemed bigger and tackier than before but it was her bedroom. Somewhere else in the house she could hear big deep grunts and the sound of a piece of furniture being pressed up against the wall again and again and again.<br />
<br />
As she clambered out of her big bed and into the landing, the noise had already stopped. A door further down started to open.<br />
<br />
Out walked Sean, completely naked, in his full glory. His huge muscles tensed up from what had obviously been an incredible fuck session judging by the sight of the girl on the bed behind him. The little fucker has never had any shame even in front of his own mother, she thought to herself, secretly proud that her son was the one that had always got all the attention growing up. The one all the guys wanted to be, all the girls wanted to be with.<br />
<br />
Sean caught sight of his mother and attempted to shove a massive hand in front of his long cock. Behind him, there was a shrill shriek as the girl realised see had been seen and tried to find something to cover up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, relax its my mom, she&#39;s cool&quot; Sean called out in his deep, relaxed and masculine tones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as relaxed as Brittany will be when she finds out you&#39;ve been cheating on her again&quot; his mom replied. &quot;Anyway, your gym called while you were....busy. Asked if you can come early today. They&#39;ve got someone in for a personal training session they&#39;d like you take care of.&quot;</p>
