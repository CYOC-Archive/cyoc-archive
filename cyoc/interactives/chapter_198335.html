<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The main grocery stores that supplied the food for Dino City were actually in Glen Rose, and largely served the same sort of function that Lyre had with Animalia. Glen Rose already had a lot of the infrastructure and set up to provide food for the new town that was built as a sister city to it. The stores had some remodeling done to enlarge their doorways and had bought some specialized carts and bags that would be easier for Dinotopians to use, but that was all relatively minor and helped allow the two cities to grow close in a way. The people of Glen Rose would have to accept and do business with their Dinotopian neighbors. And for Quetzal it was a rather easy flight from Skybax Heights, the mixed apartment/hotel tower in Dino City and with practice she&#39;d gotten fairly good at coming in for a landing at one of the crosswalks from the parking lot to the store&#39;s main doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; came a male voice from behind Quetzal and was accompanied with the heavy flapping of wings, making her turn her long neck to see her bond-mate, Fred Timm, recovering from his own landing.<br />
<br />
He stood on par with her, though the crest on his head seemed a bit larger and was colored a bright red. It was also something that also made telling the difference between them rather easy. She was covered in rather drab brown pycnofibers with dull white ones on her chest. Her beak, while long and pointed was also a dull yellow, like she was designed to try and &quot;hide&quot; on the ground. Fred Timm was flashier in that his crest and the pycnofibers on his chest were actually a bright crimson while those on sides was more of a reddish brown, but still bright enough to make him stand out. His beak was also a brighter yellow than hers. It made for an interesting comparison, though left Quetzal with questions, particularly given the large size that some Dinotopians could get to, though neither Rex nor Fred Timm had any clear answers, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... still working on the landings,&quot; Fred Timm said slowly, &quot;it&#39;s interesting... I&#39;ve spent a lot of times looking over papers, the bones, and participating in the whole theoretical debate on whether or not Quetzalcoatlus could fly... and I&#39;m still getting used to actually flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The flying isn&#39;t too bad,&quot; Quetzal teased, &quot;it&#39;s your landings that still need work. And with that... I&#39;ll carry anything that might break if jostled too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; Fred Timm answered.<br />
<br />
And the flying lessons were coming along well, and sometimes Buzz was there to provide some help. For Quetzal it was refreshing in a way to be on the other side of &quot;flight school&quot; from when she was learning to fly, which ended up including trips up to Dallas so that Sophie and Roland could provide some lessons on days when they didn&#39;t have many classes. Fred Timm had often come to them at times as well, often replacing Rex as the &quot;science&quot; expert back then, which made some degree of sense given that Rex had specialized in Tyrannosaurs and had some work with some of the other large theropods while Fred Timm had worked closer with Pterosaurs and Quetzalcoatlus specifically. Though, over time they gradually got to know each other better and things just seemed to hit off between them and from there, they met up even after she and Buzz no longer needed flight lessons from Sophie and Roland, and it got to the point where eventually they&#39;d reached a point where Fred Timm would have to convert... <br />
<br />
And as the two of them entered the grocery, Quetzal found her mind drifting back to that day...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We both need to be here?&quot; Fred Timm as he and Quetzal followed Jeremy through Dino City&#39;s Horizon Labs office.<br />
<br />
&quot;In pure theory, no, as we do have the formula for Quetzalcoatlus,&quot; Jeremy answered as he led them toward one of the transformation rooms, &quot;however, given that you gave the reason for conversion as &quot;romantic,&quot; it creates the opportunity for your conversion to be something special for you. That your partner would be the one to provide the conversion. All I really need to do is provide the counter to the vaccine in Quetzal and she can then turn you in whatever way she sees fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred Timm looked up to Quetzal and noticed the parts of her lips that were behind where her hard beak was pulled upward into a small smile. It was something that made him feel better, as he had a lot of love that had grown for Quetzal over the time they had spent together. True, she wasn&#39;t likely going to earn any awards for academic achievements, but she was a kind and decent person, and at the same time what she&#39;d told him about how her former employer had treated her added some major feelings of sympathy. While the man may not have broken the law in getting Quetzal and her friends to have all those cosmetic surgeries to play to his personal tastes, Fred Timm had found the man&#39;s actions and policies to be a form of bullying. It was the bullying that had struck a nerve with Fred Timm and drew him closer to her. Seeing her happy was a good thing, and to a degree, she&#39;d seemed to enjoy being able to fly and was looking toward more &quot;athletic&quot; pursuits.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I wasn&#39;t sure that that part was in the plan,&quot; Fred Timm admitted after a moment, &quot;after all... there is quite a bit of size difference between us at present.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there were clear differences. While the Dinotopians weren&#39;t the size of the animals they were based on, those that were big were well bigger than Humans. Fred Timm wasn&#39;t exactly a short man, but Quetzal still towered over him. He&#39;d read that there were cases where a Human converting to become an Animalian might often convert by having sex with that partner, often as a sign of love between the romantic partners. Quetzal was also more than beautiful enough to gain his attention and a part of him would like that, but she was so much taller than him and her hips were wide enough that he feared that he could engage in intercourse with her and wouldn&#39;t even generate enough stimulation to even trigger anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some things planned out,&quot; Quetzal answered as she patted her purse, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred Timm was quiet for a moment as they reached the door to the conversion room and Jeremy opened it. The male Syntixisaurus Dinotopian then held the door open and motioned for Quetzal and Fred Timm to go on. Quetzal led the way and sat down on the bed in the room, setting her purse down beside her and moving her wings so that she wasn&#39;t sitting on them. Fred Timm then stood aways apart from her while Jeremy came in and produced a small plastic box. Fred heard the box &quot;click&quot; as Jeremy opened the box and produced the syringe. From there, he rolled up Quetzal&#39;s sleeve and then administered the shot to her shoulder. Once that was done, Jeremy put the safety cap back on the syringe and then picked up the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to Dinotopia,&quot; Jeremy said to Fred Timm as he left the room and shut the door behind him.<br />
<br />
As the door shut, Quetzal then stood up again and picked up her purse before moving over to one of the end tables that was in the room. Like all the furniture in Dino City, it was taller than what a Human would need, but it was of a better height for Quetzal. She opened her purse and produced a plastic cup and then placed it down beside her purse. Fred Timm could only watch as Quetzal began to remove her shirt. Fred could only watch as her great breasts bounced free as her shirt was removed. It was a complicated move to allow for her long neck and beak and her wings, though Fred also found himself getting a bit aroused in looking to Quetzal&#39;s large breasts and engorged nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, you are going to get bigger,&quot; Quetzal spoke calmly, &quot;So... while I fill this glass for your first dose, you&#39;d best to strip down. That way we can then be ready for the second dose after you&#39;ve at least begun transforming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred Timm slowly nodded and moved over to the bed. It took him a little bit of effort, but he did manage to climb up onto it and sat down. As he set up untying his shoes, he looked up to see Quetzal lift the cup toward her breast while moving with her other hand pinch and tug at a nipple. Fred even heard her moan a little as milk flowed from her breast, through her nipple and into the cup. It took a little while, but eventually Fred was sitting there naked on the bed and tossing his clothes onto the floor with his penis also rising to full attention even as he looked to Quetzal&#39;s pycnofiber covered orbs. They were large, soft, firm, and that like any other female Animalian, it was like she didn&#39;t need a bra for support, even though they weren&#39;t enhanced by plastic as what her past employer had wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it would appear that the show was good for you,&quot; Quetzal smiled as she finished filling the cup and noting the erection between his legs. <br />
<br />
And that was one thing she liked about being an Animalian. She knew that people would always be attracted to those with generous curves, and to a degree that had been part of what had gotten her in with her previous employer. But his short cuts and cost cutting ideas had only led to follow on problems that lead to him dumping her and the others fairly quickly, and those problems lingered. As an Animalian... and specifically as a Dinotopian, she had all those curves again and they were all natural. Her breasts might be proportionately smaller than what she&#39;d been &quot;made&quot; to be in the past, but they didn&#39;t feel heavy and unwieldy. They were natural and the only real issue was making sure she didn&#39;t let them become too milk heavy.<br />
<br />
Quetzal then passed the cup to Fred Timm and stood back and watched him drink. He coughed a little at first, but that was likely that her milk probably didn&#39;t taste like the milk that most people would get from the store, and ultimately, he did down the entire cup. From there he then passed the cup back to Quetzal, and the transformation was already beginning with his fingernails lengthening into the claws that she had on her fingertips and with his fair falling out while the start of a bony crest began to form on the top of his head. It wasn&#39;t a huge crest and was shaped almost like a right triangle. That made her smile as she continued to watch Fred Timm transform.<br />
<br />
His muscles grew larger and more defined while his pycnofibers began to grow in. His head also began to stretch upwards as his neck grew longer, and he wanted to say something but at almost the same time his lips and teeth merged to form his beak. The beak grew out long and pointed directly to Quetzal and he ended up giving something of a squawk in the process. It made Quetzal chuckle a little bit, largely remembering that on some of the times where something had startled her after her conversion that she&#39;d make a similar noise. Though, as she watched Fred Timm grow larger and with his penis growing larger and throbbing with each spurt of growth, Quetzal found the squawk more sexy than funny. It got her moving to get out of her pants and underwear and get onto the main event, particularly as Fred was starting to like the feelings of the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;UnnnnnnNNNNNGGGGGHHHHHH!&quot; Fred Timm gave a heavy grunt as his wings grew out behind him and he flared them out in the process, and he relaxed a little, only to notice Quetzal approaching and giving off a very aroused scent. &quot;Quetzal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You grew into a very big boy,&quot; Quetzal said playfully and reached down to wiggle his erection, making Fred Timm breathe deeply for a moment as it moved, and he hadn&#39;t been able to look down to it, but Quetzal had and knew it was perfect. Bigger than any Human&#39;s erection. &quot;And just watching you change turned me on.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she climbed into his lap as they were now both on even par with each other while gyrating her hips forward, which pushed the front of her vagina against Fred&#39;s erect shaft, but it wasn&#39;t in a way that would let him in. It&#39;s more that she pushed it up and between them. Part of it was also that the two of them found that the long hard and pointed beaks couldn&#39;t allow for kissing and if they tried to face each other, they&#39;d risk poking the other with their beaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is tricky,&quot; Fred Timm admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but I want you in me so bad...&quot; Quetzal answered.<br />
<br />
It took a little jostling before they could get their heads pointed to a side and moved to keep their wings out of the way of their beaks. It actually resulted in each of them looking closely into the eye of the other and with their crests rubbing against the other. Once they got to this position was, they finally got to the point where Fred&#39;s erection was positioned so that it easily slid into Quetzal&#39;s vagina and a chorus of pleasure filled squawks followed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Some things about their first time had been a bit awkward, but Quetzal loved it and had found herself loving Fred more. And with practice, things got even better. The harder thing was in where to place their beaks, but they also would find that with the one on top arching their neck back they could then nuzzle their beaks together and had no worries on &quot;stabbing&quot; the other. From there, there also came the flying lessons, which Fred was getting better at and the two could settle into Dino City very well. It also gave Quetzal more reason to practice. Her size and wing structure might make long distance flying more difficult, but that didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t train. It&#39;ll make for a quick escape from the college students coming into Dino City.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice to see Sophie and her friends again... Roland, JC, and Pauline,&quot; Fred commented as he walked into the grocery with Quetzal, snapping her out of her thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Quetzal agreed, &quot;and hopefully... when she graduates college, she, her bond-mate, and her former pets can move in. It&#39;d be nice for Dino City to have some more flyers. But they still have college to finish... which you say is important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Fred Timm answered with a chuckle as the two of them moved on to their shopping.</p>
