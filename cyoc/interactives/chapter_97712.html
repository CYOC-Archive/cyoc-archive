<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly the vision of light returns to my eyes as I again awaken from slumber.  How many days has it been, sense Ty had gained control?  I haven&#39;t been counting, though I&#39;ve been through Hell and back again.  I don&#39;t know how much longer I can take this.  <br />
     I lift myself off my bed, if it can be considered my own, I don&#39;t think I even own myself anymore, and fell onto my feet.  What age was I this time?  My body must have been around fours years old.  There, in the corner of the room, in a golden rocking chair, Ty was sitting, swaying forward and back.  He was smiling at my displeasure.  <br />
     My family, he took away my family, this monster.  He took my father, my mother, myself, and, thinking about it now, he took my foster brother.  Tears began to well in my eyes.  I hate to let him, but I could&#39;n&#39;t help the overflowing tears in my eyes, pouring down my cheeks.  Ty began to laugh at me, laugh at my misery.  <br />
     This was a monster in my room, controlling my life, controlling the world.  I spoke to him, but my tears were not silent &quot;You took them away.&quot;  Ty, or what looked like Ty, at least, put on a curious, but still evil, expression.  &quot;What are you going on about, baby?&quot; He snickered, and I spoke again, my voice quivering even more than before &quot;You took my mother!&quot; the monster laughed &quot;She deserved it!&quot; my turn &quot;You took my father!&quot; and the monster laughed harder &quot;He was even worse!&quot; I had one last thing to say &quot;You took my brother!&quot;<br />
     Ty stopped laughing.  He looked at me with an expression that I couldn&#39;t quite understand, and he asked me &quot;What did you say?&quot; I lost it.  I ran at him and punched and kicked with little blows, blows that couldn&#39;t possibly hurt him, but still I hit as hard as I could.  &quot;You took my brother!&quot;  I cried out &quot;Give him back!  Give him back to me!  I want him back!&quot; He was shaking now &quot;Shut up!  He ordered.  I kept screaming at him, crying out &quot;I want my father back!  My mother back!  I want my brother back!  Give them back to me, give me back my brother!&quot; He was trembling.  <br />
     Looking up into Ty&#39;s eyes, I saw tears.  He tried to speak, but his voice wasn&#39;t anywhere to be found.  I just kept wailing at him, crying for my family, and soon, he spoke.  It wasn&#39;t clear, but it certainly was audible &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; With his words, my vision turned brighter and brighter until all I could see was bright white.  The house shook, and the room shifted, and I fell on the door.  I blinked, and my vision returned, but all I could see was my bed coming straight down on me, and I let out a short-lived scream before it hit me with great force, and the world seemed no more.  <br />
     I awaken slowly, very slowly, as light spat violently at my open eyes.  It felt like eternity before the light calmed, and I realized that I was in my own room.  I looked at my body; yep, I was still a four year-old.  But then I heard a voice calling for me from somewhere else in the house, definitely from down the stairs &quot;Dustin, sweetie, get ready for breakfast!&quot; It was mom&#39;s voice.  She was back, she was back to normal!  I stood up, off of my bed, and I realized that it wasn&#39;t too big for me.  It wasn&#39;t very high at all, perfectly sized for me!  I headed for the door, and there was a step ladder nailed onto the door.  I used the step ladder to reach the door nob, and I walked out into the hall. heading for the bathroom.  <br />
    The bathroom door also had a step ladder, and when I entered I immediately closed and locked the door.  Okay, what&#39;s happening?  I thought over and over different scenarios.  Did mom think I was always like this?  Am I four years old, or a sixteen year-old in a toddler&#39;s body?  Was dad back, too?  Where was Ty?  But mom and dad, how I wanted to see them.  <br />
     I shed my pajamas; they were a child&#39;s pajamas, buttoned up, clearly meant for my age, or developmental age, at least.  I shed them, dreading to look at what became of my dick.  When I felt a weight between my legs, on my crotch, I looked down.  It wasn&#39;t small, it was huge!  It must have been seven inches, and it was flaccid!  My balls were quite big, too!  I noticed that I was even muscular!  not just muscular, massively so!  Sure, I was short and young, but these were muscles that could only be explained by years of weight lifting!  Now I was really confused.  I looked again to my dick and balls.  They looked young, though.  They were smooth, they were pale, and they seemed a bit more lively.  I got dressed as fast as I could, but the bulge in my shorts was way too big!  That&#39;s when I noticed, on the wall, was a jockstrap.  Of course, I thought.  Can&#39;t be gifted like this without consequences.  I redressed, this time with the jockstrap on, and quickly hurried out of the bathroom, down the hall and down the stairs.  <br />
     After turning a corner to my right while I headed down the stairs, I saw both my mother and father in the kitchen, having a conversation about me.  My mother was the first I heard speak &quot;I&#39;m still worried about him!  So young, yet so strong!  He&#39;s clever, too.  He&#39;s smarter than the both of us!&quot; Before my father could respond, I walked in, interrupting their conversation.  My mother smiled at me and gestured for me to sit at the table.  I couldn&#39;t do it, I just ran towards her and hugged her, though thankfully not with all my strength.  Mom gasped &quot;Wow, there, what&#39;s all this about?&quot; I replied quickly &quot;I love you, mom!  You too, dad!&quot;  I hugged my father as well.  Before they could ask about anything, I was the first to ask a question &quot;Where&#39;s Ty?&quot; I asked.  Mom just stared at me &quot;He&#39;s in his room.  He&#39;s sick, remember?&quot; I didn&#39;t bother saying anything else, I just ran up the stairs and into Ty&#39;s bedroom.  <br />
     There he was, , Ty, laying in bed.  He was pale, green, definitely ill.  He looked at me &quot;Hey Dustin.  What is it?&quot;  he asked.  I stared at him with a mean glare &quot;Don&#39;t act so innocent!  What game are you playing at?&quot; he frowned at me.  A single tear in his eye, he spoke again &quot;No more games, Dustin.  I&#39;m done.  Everything is back to how it was supposed to be, except for you.  To you, I gave a few gifts.  I made sure that they won&#39;t make anything too bad.  Sure, you&#39;ll be treated by strangers as a simple-minded toddler, but it&#39;ll be fine, trust me.  I took away my power already, and after this conversation, I&#39;ll forget it ever existed.  I&#39;ll forget this conversation, and I&#39;ll believe life was always like this.  Of course, I made sure I&#39;ll be happier.  See, I made myself a bit more impressive.  Not as impressive as you, but impressive enough for mom and dad to treat me better.&quot;  Ty sighed.  <br />
     Ty fell asleep just then.  So, was this it?  My new life?  Ty&#39;s new life?  It wasn&#39;t that bad, actually it was great!  How do I react to this?  I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll get used to it.  I&#39;m a genius toddler with a God-sized package and extreme muscles.  I can make this work, though.  No more bullying Ty.  I can make this work for myself and Ty.  Everything&#39;s going to work out fine.</p>
