<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The loud cheers of the pirates jolt Nate back to his senses. The captain’s door is closed, and the sailors are still busy using every inch of the other cabin boy. This might be a good opportunity to explore, maybe even the only one he&#39;ll have. Nate checks to make sure no one is watching him, then starts to look through the other rooms. One stinks of sex and is filled with beds; another has hammocks that are presumably used for sleep over love. There&#39;s also a storage room, areas to man the canons, a planning room with maps spread out on the table. There&#39;s a lot on this floor, but ultimately nothing in it is important.<br />
<br />
Sneaking past the ongoing orgy, Nate descends down to the third level of the ship. The atmosphere here is startingly different. It&#39;s quieter, while also giving an almost ancient feeling. The wood here is a shade of grey compared to the ebony of the other levels. The floor open and empty, splintering off to several halls and closed doors. No sources of light bar a lantern hanging near the bottom of the stairs, which Nate brings with him. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to realise that no one should be down here, but that just means there&#39;s more of a chance to find something that might help.<br />
<br />
The floor creaks as Nate leaves the steps and starts to search the ground. The doors are all locked, and there&#39;s no light on the other side. Peeping through the keyhole, Nate sees nothing but darkness. This endeavour quickly becoming pointless as he can&#39;t access any secret that might be hidden away. Still, he tries each door at least once. Locked, locked, unlocked. The handle turns on one of the back rooms, it looks like whoever was here didn&#39;t close the door properly, which Nate plans to take full advantage of.<br />
<br />
Inside, it&#39;s as dreary as the rest of the floor. A work study with bookshelves filled to the brim. The furniture still standing, though it all seems to be gnarled. Nate scanning the covers of the books, they&#39;re all on magic and curses. Maybe this is part of the pirates plan. Nate opens a few of the tomes and reads as much of it as he can. It’s detailing how to bind a curse and spread it like a plague. This had to be the basis for whatever the captain was doing, which means there might be a book covering a cure.<br />
<br />
The quiet of the study is broken by creaking floorboards and heavy footsteps. Oh shit, someone was coming. Nate slowly closed the door, dulled the light, and waited. The door to the study opening only a few seconds after he shut it, light being shone in, as the pirate captain looks around the room. Almost immediately spotting Nate in the corner, as he sets down the light on the desk, and closes the door. The cabin boy paralysed with fear at being caught, just watching the captain’s blank expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shame, boy. Ye had a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate wants to say something, anything to convince the pirate to let him go just this once. But he&#39;s too afraid, he knew this was the one place he shouldn&#39;t be in, and the captains lack of jovialness just cements that. The pirate taking off jacket and pants, undershirt and underwear. Tall, broad, and hairy body illuminated by the lantern. The old sailor grabbing Nate by the arm, and forcing him to turn around. The cabin boy&#39;s chest pressed against the wall, and the pirate captain slowly getting closer. His hot breath felt on Nate&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer&#39;ll enjoy this, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something hard starts to force itself into Nate&#39;s ass. Pressing between his bubble butt, it’s as thick as a fist and seeming practically endless in length. The curse Nate had been afflicted with flaring to new heights as he submitted to the pirate captain. Chest against wood, and back rubbing against the muscular torso of the sailor. Strongarm’s meaty pecs pressing against Nates shoulders, knees slightly kneeling to match his subordinate&#39;s height. It&#39;s pure bliss for the two of them as the pirate slowly moves deeper and deeper.<br />
<br />
Nate starts to find it hard to move, at first, he thinks it&#39;s due to the captain pinning him to the wall, but then he realises even the slightest shake of his lower body is impossible right now. His legs are not responding to him anymore, and the captain is still pushing deeper, how long is his cock?  Its pierced far past his rectal entrance and seems to still be going. It feels so fucking good but... this isn&#39;t right, is it? There has to be something off, something wrong. Nate manages to glance down, looking to his feet and finding nothing. His legs have just vanished.<br />
<br />
All he sees is the captains hairy and mountainous feet, rising up to his legs and cock which is buried deep into Nate&#39;s ass. Still pushing forward, as the cabin boys butt begins to merge with the captain’s own dick and ass. The more he presses in, the more of Nate that he takes.  A panicked yelp escaping the smaller man as the pirate does not relent. Pressing on, as Nate&#39;s rear is absorbed into the captain’s firm and defined ass, while his dick is slowly taken in by the captain’s gargantuan cock. A few inches of Nates own member being added to the pirate’s cock, now even bigger as it presses against the hard wood of the ship.<br />
<br />
Despite no longer having an ass to be fucked, Nate still feels like he&#39;s being railed. An unknown presence digging into him, giving him pleasure beyond what he could ever imagine. The pirate thrusting his cock against the wall, Nates back pressing into the captain’s torso. Lower abs becoming clearer, losing the fat that comes from age as more of the cabin boy is dragged in. Now just an upper torso, arms, and head which are all starting to be absorbed. The captains&#39; large pecs easily taking in the rest of his chest. Becoming wider after the assimilation, as Nates arms and hands press into the pirate. The hairs on the sailor&#39;s body going from grey to bright red, skin clearing as the youth of Nate is absorbed by the captain.<br />
<br />
All that&#39;s left is Nate&#39;s own head, which is dragged into the captain like the rest of him was. The cabin boy still feeling that wonderful piercing sensation. Like the captain has shoved his dick far past his ass and through his body. Nate&#39;s mouth agape as that sensation finally reaches his mouth. Claiming the entirety of him as his head assimilates with the captains, and everything goes dark.<br />
<br />
Memories that are not his own begin to barrage Nate. He remembers growing up on a coastal town, a stronger boy that quickly joined the town guards. He oversaw the ships and trade, locking up pirates and black-market dealers alike. That was until a large vessel docked at the shore. A swarm of pirates descended on the town and Nate defended as best he could. Nate... no, his name was Llyod, that&#39;s right. Llyod fought and fought, but was eventually knocked out. Waking up naked in a cell, greeted by an orange bearded pirate who entered his prison, and entered his ass.<br />
<br />
That was the best day of his life, Captain Broadback making him a member of the crew. Dwarfing the former guard’s puny body, and making no effort to be gentle. Just shoving himself in and out, forcing a kiss or two as they made out like beasts. Llyod becoming stronger as it went. Gaining muscle, gaining hair, gaining respect for his new captain. It only ended after the captain blew his load in the new sailor’s ass, then left without a care.<br />
<br />
The new pirate went to work straight after. Dressing in his sailor&#39;s garbs, and sailing under his captain’s banner. Making new pirates, drinking with the crew, fucking and being fucked. It was the best life he knew, and it proved his worth to the captain. After years of sailing, Captain Broadback wanted a son, and he chose Lloyd. Shoving his cock deep down his crew mates throat, and feeding the smaller pirate his spunk. Months of this activity following, Lloyd becoming more like his captain after each dose. Hair turning red, body growing further, personality twisting into a confident and intelligent seaman. <br />
<br />
It all culminated to Lloyd becoming what he is now, Captain Strongarm. Granted a ship by his father and a crew to grow, he set off and began making the rounds throughout the kingdom. Plundering loot, making more pirates, and striking terror in anyone who would dare sail the seas. This was who he is, who Nate now is a part of. The lingering will of the cabin boy fading away, as not even a trace of Nate is left within the burly pirate.<br />
<br />
Captain Strongarm thrusted against the wall a few more times. The grey wood becoming white as he had his release, cleaned his cock with a cloth, then dressed into his usual garb. Smirking as he brought a hand to his chest with a heavy thump, feeling up his younger body as he spoke to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome abord, Nate.&quot;</p>
