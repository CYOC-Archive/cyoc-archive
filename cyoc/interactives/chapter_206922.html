<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassidy couldn’t believe her luck, she could fix this in a day!  She could even get back to work tomorrow, and no one would be the wiser.  She jumped for joy, only to feel the very real weight of her four tits and udder, nearly making her fall forward.<br />
<br />
She composed herself, then looked through her clothes.  None of them would fit, but she’d want a spare set for after this got fixed, and- ah ha! She eyed a bathrobe.  It had been slightly too large before, but now it was perfect to make her semi-decent for the ride and for her rendezvous with… whoever that man was.  She probably should’ve asked.<br />
<br />
As she looked over herself in the body mirror, it left little to the imagination.  Her entire front was lumpy, and a total of eight nipples and teats tented the material. Still, it was better than nothing.  She carefully returned to her vehicle with the spare set of clothes in tow.<br />
<br />
The ride was notably more annoying.  Her assets were growing as they filled with milk, and what little space she had on the trip from work was lost.  The wheel bit into her udder, and she could scarcely turn her body to look left or right without her body reminding her of the lack of space.<br />
<br />
The address was also out in the sticks, but unlike her business, this building looked a bit more...Derelict?  Its upkeep wasn’t that great and the parking lot didn’t have any street lights installed. However, there was a light at the entrance and someone standing out there.<br />
<br />
She parked her car, squeezed herself out, and approached the man.  “Hello?  Were you the voice on the phone?<br />
<br />
The man looked her over. “Yes, and you’re the one from Future Farms?”  She nodded.  “Good.  First, what kind of secrets are you bringing me?”<br />
“I’m bringing the results of their machine, and was wondering if you could help fix it?”  She undid the bathrobe, flashing the man her four breasts and udder.<br />
<br />
He went wide-eyed, then recollected himself.  “They can do that...?  Amazing.”  He paused for a bit, clearly deep in thought.  “We can revolutionize the market if we can reverse engineer it.  I’ve got a diagnostics machine that can read every chemical in a body, and determine what makes what happen.”<br />
<br />
“But, can you fix me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, we have a second device that can implement modifications.  Ah, but they’re both a little off-site.  This is just the admin building.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy shifted uneasily.  There weren’t any other buildings near the road.  “How far?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, not far at all.”  He pointed to a small vehicle, larger than a golf cart but smaller than a car.  “It’s only a few minutes away, and it’s where all the magic happens.”  He headed over to shuttle, and brought it back to where Cassidy stood.  “Hop in and we can get you fixed.”<br />
<br />
She didn’t like the idea of leaving her car behind, but who was she to ask how these people do business?  She wordlessly stepped onto the back of the cart and sat down.  After a small engine rev, the cart began moving around the building and into the fields behind it.<br />
<br />
“So, how recently did you, uh, grow those?”<br />
<br />
“It’s only been a few hours.”<br />
<br />
“Good.  New additions are less settled, easier to read and change.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy sat in silence as the building shrank into the distance.  All the bumps and jostling was irritating her udder, causing it to give her a strange sensation that felt like a need to urinate.  She then realized her lower tits were slightly leaking from getting squashed between her other assets.  “Um, I might need to get milked before you change me back.”<br />
<br />
The man laughed.  “Of course you’ll be getting milked. In fact, you’ll be walking right past the cows we do have.  I can give you the whole spiel about our business model, like you’re one of our investors.”  He paused for a moment.  “I forgot, payment!  You’d like to have us remove the, uh, spares.  I’m not sure how useful your addition will be, but I can offer five thousand.”<br />
<br />
Five thousand?  That was great!  Maybe she could become a full-time operative if the pay per run was this good.  She recollected herself to retain some professionality.  “That sounds good.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy realized something.  “I never got your name.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s intentional.  Plausible deniability and such.”<br />
<br />
After several more minutes of silence, the vehicle slowly approached a small structure, no larger than a shed.  It was hidden among the trees that lined the primary field.  He brought the cart to a stop.<br />
<br />
“Is that it?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, it’s bigger on the inside.”  He approached the unimpressive shack, pulling away a boar to reveal a metallic wall beneath with a complicated-looking display.  He gave it a thumb and face scan, entered a password, and an audible sucking noise occurred as the door unsealed.  Inside was an elevator.<br />
<br />
Cassidy realized fairly quickly that this was an underground structure!  Those things cost tons of money to make!  There’s no way these guys wasted that much money building underground, right?  “You have to be bullshitting me.”<br />
<br />
“What? You think we built this as a joke and I brought you out here to show it off?  Get on the elevator and I’ll give you the tour.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy obeyed.  He closed the door and pressed one of the few buttons available.  After some grinding noises, the elevator began to descend, going deeper into the ground.  It wasn’t moving fast, but she was surprised that it was still took over a minute to reach the bottom.  When the elevator completed, there was a hall stretching before her.<br />
<br />
The man led the way.  “Greene Fields is a company built on sustainability.  Our goal is to create a scenario where humanity can live indefinitely within a tightly enclosed space without fear running out of any necessities.  It is for this reason that we’ve built this underground bunker, to prove it can work.<br />
<br />
He approached a room, opening a door.  Inside were four cows that were hooked to milk machines, along with several more stalls open.  “We are making huge leaps forward in modifying what animals can eat, and how much space they really need.”  Cassidy realized there was one more tube, going into their mouth.  “These cattle have been modified to convert trash to milk at an extreme rate, such that they don’t ever need to be removed from their machines.”  He paused, breaking character.  “Sorry, but these are the only milk machines we have at the moment. You’ll be using these when we want to undo things.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy shifted uneasily.  These cows were practically zombies, or just cogs in a milk machine.  “I think I’ve seen enough.  Can we get this over with?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, you don’t want to see the chickens or pig?  Admittedly, no one really wants to look at how we farm pig meat, but-”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want to get this done.”<br />
<br />
He rolled his eyes.  “Okay.”  Returning to the main hall, they walked quite a ways down the sparse corridors until the man opened a new door.  Inside was something that looked like a CAT scan, scaled up massively.  “Here’s the diagnostics machine.”<br />
<br />
“Why was it so far from the animals?”<br />
<br />
“The front entrance is closer this way, but it’s a relatively tight ladder-climb down.  I didn’t think you’d appreciate climbing a ladder in your current condition, so we used the livestock elevator.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Thanks.”<br />
<br />
The scan wasn’t too much of a problem, as it had been apparently made to scan animals much larger than humans.  It was the automated needles that were bothersome. The machine expertly drew out blood, breastmilk, udder-milk, and several other materials that hurt as they were removed.<br />
<br />
The man clapped his hands together as the machine shut down. “Oh man, this thing is saying I can change counts and lactation rates!  Very good stuff.”  He smiled.  “Anyways, time to finish this deal.  One last stop to get you fixed.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy nodded, then followed him out once more.  After much backtracking, nearly all the way back to where the cows were, the man eventually opened a new door.  Strangely, it looked almost exactly like the machine at her workplace. “This looks almost like-”<br />
<br />
“-Yeah, we hired some talent that had a hand in building Future Farms’ stuff.  Get on and I’ll take care of you.” He paused briefly, then pressed some buttons to cause a beaker to fill with an opaque white liquid.  “Oh yeah.  You need to drink this.  It’s necessary for destability and removal.”<br />
<br />
She nodded, then downed the beverage.  It had a bitter taste and her stomach immediately started folding into knots, but it wasn’t bad enough to incapacitate her. The machine activated and eight tubes extended to her various tits and teats.  <br />
<br />
The man paused.  “Alright, it should be-”  The machine beeped, then a painful suction occurred across her four breasts.  As quickly as the suction started, it had already ended.<br />
<br />
Cassidy frantically pulled off one of the cups, revealing that her nipple had been turned into another cow teat!  “Hey, what the hell?!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, geez, sorry.  Machine doesn’t like being hooked up to not-cow parts.  Please reattach the cup and I’ll fix it.”  She obeyed, but gave him a sideways glance.  <br />
<br />
The pause was taking too long. “Hey, what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Just waiting for the destabilizer.  Do you feel any pain?  Hunger?”<br />
<br />
Hunger?  She hadn’t thought about it, but she actually was feeling pretty hungry.  “Yeah?   Why am I feeling hungry?”<br />
<br />
“Side effect of the destabilizer.  Means we’re good to go.”  He hit several buttons, then Cassidy felt a thump from the machine.<br />
<br />
Then another.  And more in increasing rapidity, until the machine sounded like a lawnmower as each thump proceeded with another.  She felt something strange happening across all her breasts, like a tingling or burning sensation, and even after the machine stopped its thumping, she continued to feel it.<br />
<br />
The tubes retracted, but she still had everything on her!  Worse yet, they felt heavier than ever!  She grasped onto one of her breasts, and was alarmed to feel it heavy with milk, and pushing further outward.  “What the hell?!”<br />
<br />
“Looks like it was a success!”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what?!  They’re still here!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, and you have about five minutes before they explode from their own productivity and you die.  Please follow me.”  Cassidy stood in shock as she started to feel her body scream that she needed to be milked, then the man grabbed her.  “No time for panic, my little cash cow.”  Wrapping her arm around his body, he physically began to drag her toward the cow room.<br />
<br />
He tossed her into a stall, then moved a second milk machine over to her.  Her breasts had begun to redden from the sheer pressure they were forced to hold in.  He attached both machines to Cassidy, then flipped them on.  She felt some relief, but her udder was producing nearly as fast as it was getting sucked out.  She felt constantly overfull, and was starting to get woozy.<br />
<br />
He pulled a food tube down.  “Your body and bones are getting sucked dry to make more milk.  You need this feed tube or else you die.”<br />
<br />
“You...won’t get away w-”  was as far as Cassidy got before the tube was stuffed into her mouth.  She felt a flow enter her body, but her stomach didn’t fill.<br />
<br />
“Shh.  You’re going to go to sleep for a while as your body focuses on production.  I know you don’t see it, but you’ve opened entirely new paths into sustainability.”<br />
<br />
He continued to monologue, but Cassidy struggled to remain awake as she drifted into an unnatural sleep.</p>
