<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cowritten with Anonymous aka Real History <br />
<br />
Melissa had her arm wrapped around Casseus&#39;s arm as they walked down the sidewalk, both of them had dressed elegantly for a night out on the town. Although Melissa had been trying to make the night a memorable one, she noticed Casseus was seeming distracted about something. She knew it couldn&#39;t have been her, as he had been opening up to her in these last few months the two had gotten to know each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin? Something the matter?&quot; Melissa finally asked him as they walked down the block. Casseus was unsure at first whether or not to tell Melissa about his situation with the Boss, but he didn&#39;t really have anyone else to vent his frustration out towards.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s....my boss. I&#39;ve become so....embittered with everything that&#39;s going on. He thinks I&#39;ve been a little soft lately, and he seems to be pushing for a &#39;younger model&#39; as it were to take my job away from me as it were.&quot; Casseus admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, I cannot believe that. From what I&#39;ve seen, you have boss material, you have the muscle, the ferocity, the will, but you don&#39;t seem to be able to....I don&#39;t know, raise hell? Make your superior see that you are the one who should take charge, hell, I don&#39;t know why you haven&#39;t taken charge of this bastard of a boss before?&quot; Melissa argued with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you don&#39;t know this man like I do, woman. He is someone you shouldn&#39;t agitate, he is one of those people that could literally crush you under his thumb.&quot; Casseus argued back with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bull....shit! You just think he can, but trust me, he&#39;s just one of those jackasses that worked his way to the top from being a snot nose pencil pusher. You know how I got to the top? By making sure I was never that. Every job I got, I made sure I pushed the little people beneath me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not a &#39;little person&#39; as you so eloquently put it, and you should probably watch your mouth because he potentially has spies everywhere, so just....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hands up! Give me, whatever money you have on you, now!&quot; A dirty looking mugger said. The mugger looked like he was in his thirties holding a gun, he looked unshaven, and his hair was relatively long.<br />
<br />
Melissa and Casseus held up their hands as the mugger shakenly moved towards the two of them. &quot;Dustin do something,&quot; Melissa whispered.<br />
<br />
Casseus was silent, furrowing his brow as the mugger now snatched Melissa&#39;s purse. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything stupid,&quot; the mugger said quickly, jamming the gun into Melissa&#39;s stomach. &quot;I got no problem putting a bullet in your old lady.&quot; Casseus seethed, staring into the beady eyes of this supposed thug. This man was nothing, a drug fiend and lowlife looking for cash to get his next fix. If he were alone, he would crush this man with a thought. That wasn&#39;t an option though, not with Melissa present. As much as he liked her, he dare not reveal what he was for fear if what could happen to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus turned, seeing the look of fear on Melissa&#39;s face. That look alone caused his blood to boil. Melissa looked both frightened and disgusted by Casseus&#39;s lack of action. &quot;Looks like you picked a real winner lady,&quot; the mugger chuckled. &quot;He&#39;s smart though, I got no problem putting a bullet in either one of you. Still....if you&#39;re looking for a real man.&quot; Melissa breathed in sharply, the mugger grasping Melissa&#39;s groin and squeezing.<br />
<br />
That was the breaking point for Casseus. The Boss, Villar, Fukushu, all had questioned him. All questioned whether he would act when confronted. What type of man would sit idly by as his woman was assaulted? Releasing a roar he did not think possible, he reached for the mugger&#39;s arm with the gun and twisted it cracking the arm and exposing his bone.<br />
<br />
This caused the mugger to fall down to his knees, a painful scream leaving his body. &quot;Let me show you what a real man can do,&quot; Casseus growled, grabbing the man around the throat as he repeatedly punched their potential mugger in the face. As Casseus was beating the man&#39;s face in, Melissa watched him and seemed almost in awe of the moment, she watched Casseus&#39;s hand come down, the sound of man&#39;s face breaking. Things seemed to be moving in slow motion for her as the beating looked to her like a work of art, Casseus was the artist painting blood red on his human easel.<br />
<br />
Casseus had pounded the man&#39;s face reducing it to an unrecognizable bloody mess. His breathing ragged, Casseus looked up at Melissa who was looking at him in surprise. He stopped and looked at the mugger noticing he was barely breathing. Slowly he now stood, trying to control his anger as he turned to Melissa now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We...we should go, he&#39;ll....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t finish.&quot; Melissa said as she walked over to the mugger and stomped hard on the man&#39;s face with her shoe killing the man and then slowly took a few steps back and stood next to Casseus.<br />
<br />
Casseus himself was shocked at what Melissa had just done and didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry you had to see that. My anger at my situation made me lose control and it made me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel alive.&quot; Melissa said taking a deep exhale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always imagined what it felt like to crush someone under my foot, but to actually do it. It made me feel so....alive.&quot; Melissa admitted to Casseus smiling at him as he smiled back.<br />
<br />
The two of them looked down at the body and knew someone would eventually find it. Casseus had Melissa bring his car around as Casseus stuffed the corpse into the trunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do we dump this trash?&quot; Melissa said as she now sat in the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could just dump him in some landfill. Although, have you ever seen &#39;Breaking Bad&#39;? I think I could arrange it so we could just have the body dissolve?&quot; Casseus suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I like that. Make his disgusting body crumble until he&#39;s nothing and best of all, no one will miss him. God, is this turning you on as much as it is me?&quot; Melissa asked with an excited sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had known beating a man to death would excite you this much I wouldn&#39;t have waited so long,&quot; Casseus chuckled. &quot;Still, you&#39;re going to have to explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What we just did, we killed a man and it awakened something in me that I haven&#39;t felt since the first time I fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well technically you did just pop your cherry,&quot; Casseus stated, still confused. &quot;But I still don&#39;t get what you&#39;re getting at<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea here, you and I have had a great connection Dustin. But these last few months, I wanted something more to connect us together and this....this was it. God I never thought I could meet someone who would bring out this urge I didn&#39;t know I had in me.&quot; Melissa said with a relieved sigh.<br />
<br />
As Casseus drove the car, the two of them pulled over at a dark side road and stopped. Melissa was confused as she looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d we stop? I thought we were going to dissolve the guy in our trunk?&quot; Casseus looked down at his hands then over at Melissa, he knew this was a now or never moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa, there&#39;s something I....have to tell you: this, isn&#39;t exactly my real form. You see, my....job has me working with....magic, yes, it exists, and there are people out there who...did this to me.&quot; Casseus said as he finally revealed his true form to Melissa who cupped her mouth in shock. Sitting before her wasn&#39;t the handsome silver haired man. Instead, Melissa now beheld a man with cracked, scarred, and greying skin framed by long silver hair. Stranger still was the man&#39;s eyes, one human while the other was a point of reddish light in an empty black socket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin....&quot; Melissa said gently putting her hand on Casseus&#39;s face. &quot;What kind of monsters did this to you?&quot; Casseus was surprised by the question, he thought she might be alarmed at his appearance but was almost taken aback by her response. &quot;The kind of monsters that call themselves heroes,&quot; he said. Melissa simply nodded, surprising Casseus as she leaned in to give the man a kiss. &quot;Well now those so called &#39;heroes&#39; are going to have to deal with me.&quot; Melissa smirked.<br />
<br />
A wide grin now spread across Casseus face as the pair now continued. For those who considered him an enemy, they would be forced to deal with someone just as wicked as him.</p>
