<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Very well Mrs. Brockman but I need to do something first.” I said as I walk over and pick up the ‘clothing ring’ then headed towards Nadia. Silently making a wish; I snap my fingers three times and chairs appear on the stage. One in the middle and two off the side.<br />
<br />
“What the hell was that?” Asked Brad clearly shocked as he finally noticed the audience and try to cover himself up with his hands.<br />
<br />
“Magic Bradly.” Said Carly from the lap of the star quarterback. Brad squint his eyes as if he recognized Carly.<br />
<br />
“Carlos?” Asked Brad in shocked.<br />
<br />
“It’s Carly now Bradly boy.” Answered Carly causing the audience laugh at him. I was soon next to Nadia and hold the clothing ring above her head.<br />
<br />
“Please hold this from the inside.” I instructed and Nadia nervously obeyed. I let go of the ring and made a silent wish. “Now let go.”<br />
<br />
Nadia let go of the ring; as it fell to the ground and pass her, the towel she was wearing turned into her standard uniform. Nadia seemed happy to be back in her uniform more than anything. I turn to Monica and gestured towards the chairs on the side.<br />
<br />
“Have a seat with Nadia, she needs you Moni. Don’t worry Mrs. Brockman can be my assistant for the next couple of acts.” I insured Monica. Monica nodded her head in agreement as she led Nadia to the seats. <br />
<br />
“Umm can I get some clothes too?” Brad asked really upset that he has to cover his junk with his hands. I walked over to Mrs. Brockman with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Sorry but you won’t be needing clothes.” I responded causing Brad to give me a confused look. I wished a paddled to appear in my hand which it did. <br />
<br />
<i>‘This paddle will regress Brad one year every time you spank his butt.’</i> I whispered in her ear as I handed her the paddle. She smiled at me then headed over to Brad.<br />
<br />
“What…Mom?” Brad asked as she grabbed his arm and dragged Brad over to the chair in the middle. Once they got there; Mrs. Brockman sat down on the chair and managed to force Brad across her lap. She raised the paddle.<br />
<br />
<b>Whack. Whack. Whack. Whack. Whack.</b><br />
<br />
“Mom what are you doing?” Asked Brad but noticed his voice got higher. The audience was shock as Brad seemed to get younger. Now he look like a preteen around twelve years olds.<br />
<br />
“Punishing a naughty boy who did unspeakable things.” Answered Mrs. Brockman as she raised the paddle again.<br />
<br />
<b>Whack. Whack. Whack. Whack. Whack. Whack.</b><br />
<br />
“Mama pleased stop?” Brad begged in a high voiced. He was now 6 years old and lost a lot of mass. He now easily fit in his mother’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Nope you’ve been a naughty boy.” Said Mrs. Brockman as she raised the paddle again.<br />
<br />
<b>Whack. Whack. Whack.</b><br />
<br />
Soon Brad was toddler of three years old crying his eyes out on his mother’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Almost there.” Mrs. Brockman in a singsong tone as she raised the paddle again for one final time.<br />
<br />
<b>Whack. Whack. Whack.</b><br />
<br />
The audience was shock to see that Brad was reduced to a baby barely two weeks old. Brad had tired himself and was asleep on his mother’s lap. Mrs Brockman carefully pick up Brad then place him on his back on the floor. She then got up and walked over to me.<br />
<br />
“Okay please get rid of him.” Said Mrs. Brockman to me shocking me at how casual she requested that.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? He is your son.” I started to state but Mrs. Brockman had a look as if she was going to reveal a secret.<br />
<br />
“I never wanted sons. Yes I wanted multiple children but never sons. My husband has somewhat similar opinion but we had Brad because and I quote ‘We need a son to carry on the Brockman name.’ However even so he never really help me discipline him as much as we both did with Becky and Betty. That’s why he turn out the way he did, a strict mother and a father who couldn’t care more.” Mrs. Brockman said before taking a breath to continue.<br />
<br />
“If Tim had been more strict in Brad’s life then maybe he wouldn’t have turned out the way he did. However over the past year Brad became a moot point when Seth got Becky pregnant. Both me and Tim were impress that Seth not only took responsibility; but also when they married Seth took the Brockman name instead of the other way around with Becky. So much so that Tim decided to offer Seth a chance to work at his company.” Mrs. Brockman said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“He turn out to be a better son than Brad. Sadly it’s what cause Brad’s declined.” Mrs. Brockman finished. I nodded in response remembering how Brad has been acting recently.<br />
<br />
“Okay then one reality warping trick coming up.” I said as I wish up a sheet. I walked to the sleeping baby Brad and cover him in the sheet. I put the sheet on him and made the wish. I pulled the sheet off of him and in a flash of light baby Brad was gone. Everyone in the audience gasped as well as Monica and Nadia from the side.<br />
<br />
I quickly rush over to Mrs. Brockman who suddenly became very faint and was griping her head. Letting her lean on me, I made a wish then touch her head. She immediately recovered and stood back up.<br />
<br />
“What just happened?” Mrs. Brockman asked very confused at what happen.<br />
<br />
“I did what you ask but due to the restrictions I had to put it left you in a not good condition. But don’t worry I gave you the strength to temporary; however you may need to sit down soon and probably go to bed for the rest of the day.” I started to explain.<br />
<br />
“What restrictions?” Demanded Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t make Brad permanently however all I did was make him the unwanted son you gave birth two weeks ago.” I continued.<br />
<br />
“That explains what I just felt; I was in bed for weeks after giving birth to my children.” Interrupted Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“However you and your husband decided to give him up because you both agree during your pregnancy, you both agree that having a child with that big of an age gap would not look good. So you kept yourself lock up in this house and gave birth in secret. Right now Brad or should I say baby John Doe was dropped off at orphanage still opened.” I finished explaining. <br />
<br />
“That would explain some conflicting memories.” Mrs. Brockman commented.<br />
<br />
“Yeah really shouldn’t be out and about like that in your condition.” I decided to say as a jab.<br />
<br />
“Okay why make me strong enough to be out and about?” Mrs. Brockman asked.<br />
<br />
“For the next trick.” I said excitedly confusing Mrs. Brockman but I turn to the audience who was silent at this point. <br />
<br />
“Alright boys and girls. Now that Brad is gone we have a problem.” I announce to the audience and they seem confuse. “This was supposed to be the birthday boy’s belated party. No birthday boy; no party so your parents will wonder why we are out so late.” The audience gasped at this but I hold out my hand to calm them.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry I have an idea to fix this. So happy birthday! Next trick is to turn one of you into a new Brockman.” I announced this caused the audience to look at me in silence. “Now who wants to become a Brockman?” I asked. There was silence for a good two minutes.<br />
<br />
“I’ll do it.” Came a response.</p>
