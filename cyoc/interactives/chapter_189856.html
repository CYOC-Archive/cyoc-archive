<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, that worked. It seemed whatever Charlie had been on had not only affected his body, but also affected how his mind handled things. And there was that weird nickname again. Even though it seemed Charlie wasn&#39;t exactly in that state any more, there was still that vibe in how he said Mr. Officer. Huh. Well, it was worth looking into.<br />
<br />
There was also the matter of Charlie&#39;s body and the other changes that had taken place. Apparently he&#39;d needed to dye his hair, and now his chest was oddly hairy. It was in the same place and configuration as human male chest hair, but it didn&#39;t LOOK like chest hair. It looked...different somehow. Liam knew he should be able to place it, but for the life of him he just couldn&#39;t. He thought about how this probably meant there was some weird new drug out on the streets. And whatever it was, it was probably popular with preppy boys like Charlie here.<br />
<br />
Liam bit his lip lightly. He needed to investigate further, and that meant getting more friendly with Charlie. Earning his trust and learning who was responsible for distribution and production. It had to be someone pretty well off for it to be making the rounds with the wealthy side of town rather than the poor. Probably someone within their general social sphere. But for now, Liam needed to work his way in and see what in all was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind,&quot; Liam asked, &quot;If I joined you for a workout today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;Mister Officer, I&#39;d be happy if you joined me. I mean, I have to aspire to you now instead of the other way around. Let&#39;s hit some weights.&quot; Liam was happy to learn that it seemed they&#39;d made some sort of connection through the gym. The muscular cop led the way over toward the deadlifts once Charlie got done with his current set as he dealt with his strength issues.<br />
<br />
Liam racked 225 lbs on the deadlift, eager to demonstrate what he could do.<br />
<br />
He peeled off his shirt for the first set, and watched Charlie&#39;s eyes widen as he looked at the small bush of hair on Liam&#39;s chest, and then at the tightly toned, muscled look the cop had. Hot cop indeed. Charlie told himself as he watched Liam get in position and start preparing for the lift that he was not gay at all. He was just admiring Liam&#39;s form, musculature, and size. After all, at this point Charlie knew he still liked girls...<br />
<br />
Because when one of the women in the gym walked by, Charlie gulped in order to swallow down a yelp. His cock pulsed in his shorts, and Charlie could feel himself immediately growing excited. He had never had self control that poor before. Just seeing someone was turning him on. Whether it was the well muscled and strong Liam currently lifting 225 lbs and going for his seventh rep, or that blond hottie with the large breasts in a pair of short shorts and a sports bra...<br />
<br />
It took all that Charlie had to calm himself down, though he just as quickly shook on his feet when Liam got done and patted him on the shoulder. &quot;Your turn, big guy.&quot; Liam said.<br />
<br />
Charlie just as well almost wanted to run off to the bathroom to jerk off in one of the stalls - as much as his body it seemed had diminished, his libido if anything had grown stronger still. More demanding, and eager to go. As Charlie pushed himself to do 225 deadlift reps, having to go slower and more concentrated, he found himself admitting it wasn&#39;t entirely a bad trade. Get a smaller body, but get a more intense, strong libido? It didn&#39;t seem too bad. Maybe if Charlie could just work his body back up...<br />
<br />
Liam was very obviously checking out the blond bombshell now, and Charlie didn&#39;t exactly blame him.<br />
<br />
She was hot, and so was he. Charlie could totally see those two getting together - after all, it&#39;d only be bad if the girlfriend found out about it, as far as Charlie was concerned. Her taking him out, getting coffee, him bringing her home in that police car of his, and then she would peel off his shirt and start kissing his rugged, strong pecs and drinking in the moans when she started kissing his nipples. Then she&#39;d kiss lower and lower, until she started taking his dick into her mo---<br />
<br />
Charlie cursed under his breath and dropped the weight, only barely containing himself. &quot;I...uhh. I&#39;ll uhh, b-b-be right back...&quot; He managed to get out, making Liam and his hot new friend stare a bit as Charlie raced off into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Liam stared at where the rich boy had previously been standing, and walked over. The guy was almost tripping over himself as Liam watched him run to the locker room. Liam tilted his head, and wondered. Maybe something was going on in there...<br />
<br />
Charlie for his part rushed into one of the stalls and almost fell over himself pulling his pants down.<br />
<br />
The rich young man grit his teeth, feeling some of them seem slightly sharper than usual, pulling his pants down as soon as he was sure he was alone. The moment his cock was free, it bobbed, pulsed, and shot off. He&#39;d gotten far, far too excited out there just from thinking about Liam and a potential hot hook up. Charlie wavered on his feet as his orgasm raged through him, let loose at last. It seemed his emission went on for a fair bit, and he groaned - almost sounding like a yowl slightly - and by the time he was done, he jerked it one final time just to be sure, and almost lost his footing from the sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...wow...&quot; Charlie had been basically hyperventilating through the whole thing. He hoped nobody&#39;d think he was a weirdo or anything. It was bad enough that Liam thought he was gay! Charlie grinned despite himself. Fuck but that felt good, even if it was kind of embarrassing. He didn&#39;t even notice his chest &quot;hair&quot; slightly thicken further, his fingernails slightly sharper.<br />
<br />
By the time Charlie left the stall, he found himself looking at Liam - waiting there, evidently having went in to check on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, man?&quot; Liam asked in a flat tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m...I&#39;m fine. Just really had to go!&quot; Charlie said with a chuckle and started heading out. He knew he&#39;d left the toilet in a pretty messy state, streaked with his emission. But as far as he was concerned, that was not his problem. That was a janitor problem.<br />
<br />
Liam observed Charlie as the two of them left the locker room to continue their workout. Charlie seemed to have slightly more spring in his step now as opposed to before. Liam swore that he could see Charlie looked if anything slightly more lean still than before. Maybe whatever was going on, he was just not suited for tremendous bulky muscle. Made Liam wonder. Whatever happened in there, Charlie sure seemed relieved, at least for now.<br />
<br />
He considered, and went along with continuing the workout - through the next few exercises noting that Charlie seemed to prioritize lighter weights that weren&#39;t near his typical weight before. He seemed to either have made peace with what happened to himself, or was just lifting with the state of being he had right now. Liam figured once they were done, he could continue the social occasion and find out who Charlie&#39;s dealer was. It did seem like Charlie was acclimating to Liam joining him like this very well. He seemed to regard the two of them as just friends - quite a bit trusting!<br />
<br />
By the time they were done, both young men were covered in a sheen of sweat. Charlie wiped his forehead and grinned, &quot;That was quite...thrilling, Mister Officer. Thanks for joining me for that workout. I know I wasn&#39;t exactly at my typical threshold. But give me time and I&#39;ll...acclimate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What next?&quot; Liam asked, wiping his forehead. Fuck, but he always enjoyed a good workout. Helped cement his position as the town&#39;s sexiest lawman. AND it was helping him get to the bottom of a case? All seemed pretty good.</p>
