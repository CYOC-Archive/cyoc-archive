<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly some memories of Madame' Illusia and that day so long ago he'd forgot it ever was, thought Bob. The man said he'd been there a stallion for now five years, he really didn't believe it! Then too, his learned passion and touching for the mare called as Mrs. Veenstra, he wondered?<br />
<br />
Plodding down the cobblestoned isle he came out into the golden red light of yet some sundown as the little man sat high on the nearby fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got ya thinking I bet!&quot; yelled the man as Bob turned a listening ear.<br />
<br />
A snort and Bob plodded over to be almost face to face with this strange talking man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll speak slowly as my words will carry more meaning, understand me now?&quot; said the man as Bob gave an understanding nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must have insulted the old Witch but good, she put some wicked curse on you making for me one fine Arabian stud. Like I said before you've been here now five years since that day you drank of the tainted trough over there. Yup the water has in it some special chemicals that if one drinks, washes, or plays in can and will make changes happen. Madame' starts the changes but it's those guys as Animal Husbandry department who makes the real magic. Hey, here comes some teenager there and he's been playing Gunslinger about town all day. Now watch him as he comes to the trough, just watch!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Bob looked over his left flank to see a blurry figure walking over to the trough.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm hot and tired, but this place does have it's fun!&quot; said the figure as he stood by the trough.<br />
<br />
Bob felt a sudden urge to warn him away from the trough and turned round making a mad dash across the corral. Screaming a warning whinnie the young man looked up first in fright but then in anger. As Bob stood there breathing heavily down on the boy his thoughts were for safety but no heed was being taken.<br />
<br />
Tossing his western hat to the ground the boy yelped a yell tossing himself into the cool water of the long trough. Bubbles came up and blubbering the water out came the young man soaked to the skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow that feels so damn goo,haw! Huh, haw! Hey, haw! Hey, hee, haw!&quot; said the young man as his eyes went wild of fear and a voice turned rough with gravely sounds.<br />
<br />
Bob looked at the young man as he stood there dripping wet and changing ever so fast. The man's ears stretched out longer and soon had a layer of fur.<br />
<br />
In a panic the young man dunked his head down into the trough for yet another time as he tore at those new ears. It must have been a good minute cause when he raised his head out of the water it was totally that of a Donkey.<br />
<br />
Bob stood in horror watching as the young man's chest began to barrel out and his arms fast took on forelegged form. He stood there studdering and making wierd sounds as the little man walked over and hooped a halter on his soon new Donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much how it happened to you there Bob, the memory goes first and with a few hours of change in a stall he should be ready for market in two or three days!&quot; told the man as the Gunslinger's shirt ripped wide open and his gun belt popped, dropping into the dust.<br />
<br />
Bob whinnied his disgust as the change was fast making the tall young man a long and lean Donkey male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't give a worry for him he was out in the street today shooting up the town. I imagine his guts full of the saloon's Donkey brew and it would have been only tomorrow before he'd look as he does now. I myself prefer root beer to their lusty mixtures, so he can sleep his change away while you and I need to tend to your working cock there.&quot; said the little man to Bob.<br />
<br />
Bob stood there in the corral as the fast changing young man hobbled into the barn and got used to his own stall. A time of panic laden screaming brays came from the barn as Bob was led to stand in the ready area of his stable.<br />
<br />
It became as so many times before that a bucket of warm water and a sponge was soaking his sheath. The sensuous feeling made his cock fill and falling out of the sheath stood ready for what was to come.<br />
<br />
Soft words helped that moment of trusting be ever so calm for Bob. He tried to twist his neck and look backwards and down up still could not see what was happening. Returning to stand alert with head high the stallion just felt the healthy processing being done to his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Bob, easy, I need to clean your shaft less my stallion get any of three sexual deceases going! Now be extra calm as normal while I bend the cock up and with a swab poke out the pearl of dried semen stuck just in this odd little corner of the cock's opening .&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Bob jerked a little as the pearl poked loose from inside his cock's opening. He somehow remembered this to have been done a hundred times. He didn't know why this man toyed with his cock in that way but he trusted him and trust was what his life was all about.<br />
<br />
The man stood up and holding a swab high for Bob to see he announced, &quot;There she is, one horse semen pearl! Yup the stallion is the only animal I know that has this problem. Yup, we don't remove it and in time you can't even pee a solid stream. Worse yet it could plug you off in time and cause an early death, now we don't want that do we my fine good stud!&quot; <br />
<br />
Bob turned to see it and the odor was making him curl his upper lip with odd facination. A reaching nip as Bob was instinctively urged to bite and eat the pearl of his own semen, but a quick jerk away sent the gray marble flying off into some far corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, you shouldn't eat your own semen, it make you sick, then I get our town horse doctor! You won't like him he's more a witch doctor that a healer.&quot; said the little man as renewed screams of donkey transformationing came from the barn.<br />
<br />
A pat to Bob's large buttocks and he was urged to follow the man down the long stable isleway to his big box stall and a night's sleep.</p>
