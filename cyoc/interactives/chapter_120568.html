<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know sometimes I wish you had gotten the virus as well. That way you were a baby as well and we could play together for real” she said as she gripped the railing of the playpen, “I know you would definitely enjoy the diapers” Jan said as she rubbed the back of her pampers suggestively.<br />
<br />
Brad was struck speechless by her suggestion but he had to admit he was definitely curious about what it would be like to be a baby again. Not having to worry about the girls or work or having to take care of the house, all those responsibilities just disappearing sounded really. Even more considering he spent the night and part of this morning dealing with bitchy crying toddler in a stinky pamper. He could definitely use a break after those stressful ordeals.<br />
<br />
And then there was that last thing she said about him enjoying being back in diapers which peaked his interest. Having already seen Jan pee and poop in them and then changing her twice into a clean one made Brad wonder what it would be like to wear and use that crinkly plastic padding again. His penis became erect again and he imagined it much smaller and hairless, trapped within the crinkly confines of a disposable diaper. The more he thought about it and pictured it the more the desire inside him grew to relive his diaper days.<br />
<br />
Eventually the temptation grew too much and he made his decision.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me honey I’ll be right back” Brad said as he practically jumped out of the playpen, snatching up the Chronivac before running up stairs.<br />
<br />
As he made his way back to the master bedroom he quickly peeked inside both girls’ rooms to see they were still fast asleep. Glad that he wouldn’t be disturbed he went into his room and closed the door, but not completely leaving it open a crack. Taking the Chronivac in his hands he quickly brought up his own profile and wasted no time in changing the number in the age box to a 2 which would make him a 2 year old toddler just like Jan. He also set the clothing function to make it so his clothes would disappear as he regressed eventually leaving him just a diaper, also just like Jan. As Brad was double checking to make sure he’d still have his adult mind he noticed the ‘alter reality’ function was still engaged. Looking more closely at that particular function he saw that he could exclude people from the mind alteration and decided to make it so Jan would remember him being an adult. Sure it would be tough explaining to her what happened but it would be worth it to see the look on her face when he unexpectedly turned back into a baby. Satisfied with all the changes he programmed in a two minute delay on his physical regression to give him enough time to get back downstairs and join Jan in the playpen before hitting the magic button that would literally change his life.<br />
<br />
The second after he pushed the ‘execute’ button Brad immediately went over to the dresser he and his wife shared he pulled open the sock drawer and stashed the Chronivac inside. He was paranoid that Robin or Sally might try to take it from him after he became a toddler. Hopefully no one would find it there and potentially mess with it until he could retrieve it later and find a better hiding place for it. He chose that particular drawer because it was on the bottom and would be easy for him to reach in his new younger body. Closing the drawer he then turned around to leave only to notice the room had changed in the few seconds he wasn’t paying attention. The large queen sized bed had been replaced by a large crib complete with spinning mobile. There was also a lot more baby appropriate toys scattered around the room and the walls now had a baby blue motif with puffy white clouds. <br />
<br />
The entire room had become a full on nursery, prefect for what would soon be two babies.<br />
 <br />
Realizing he had less than a minute before the physical regression Brad quickly ran back downstairs and into the living room, swinging his legs over the side of the playpen to stand before his wife. Looking down he saw that while he was gone Jan had taken to playing with one of her stuffed animals, a black and white penguin to be specific.<br />
<br />
“Brad what’s with all the running around?” she asked quizzically staring at her husband.<br />
<br />
“Oh you’ll see honey” Brad grinned just as the two minute delay ended.<br />
<br />
It started as a tingling sensation running throughout his body, his clothes feeling looser as the regression began to take effect. Brad noticed he was already starting to lose height the floor looking a little bit closer than before as he aged backwards. He could already feel the stress and tiredness of old age slip away being replaced with the energy and vigor of his youth which he was regaining more of with each passing second. He had to admit growing younger was way better than growing older.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jan was staring open mouthed at the fact her 35 year old husband was growing younger before her very eyes.<br />
<br />
He now looked like he did when they first got married a 26 year old young. But that didn’t last long as ten seconds later he was a 17 year old teenager. She barely had time to blink before Brad was re-entering the single digits of early childhood. And yet despite all this he didn’t look the least bit surprised or concerned that he was aging backward. In fact her husband looked happy about it. By this point all his clothes had vanished save for his underwear which had already turned into a pair of pull ups. Brad frowned at the sight of the training pants as they meant he still had some control over his bathroom needs. He was about to throw a fit when he felt the padded undergarments swell, turning into a thick crinkly pampers disposable diaper. Brad’s frown instantly became a smile as it was now official; he was back in diapers. He was no longer potty trained or capable of using a toilet for his bathroom was now wrapped around his cute little butt, one that he could go in at any time. And after he did his business an adult would change him into a nice clean one. All these thoughts filled his mind making him excited for his future as a diaper dependant toddler.<br />
<br />
As for Jan she simply stared speechless at her husband who had stopped regressing and was now a precious looking 2 year old baby boy.<br />
<br />
“B-Brad?...You’re a baby?” she questioned aloud wondering if her secret wish had come true.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, I’m a baby now just like you” he replied sitting down on the floor, loving the cushy feel of the pampers taped to his bottom.<br />
<br />
“But how?”<br />
<br />
“Remember that package I got yesterday? It turned out to be a device capable of altering reality. When you told me about your desire for me to be a baby I decided to make you wish come true…in a way. Everyone except for you thinks I have the regression virus that you caught, you the only one who knows that I’m supposed to be an adult” Brad explained as he unknowing played with his feet.<br />
<br />
“Even the girls?” she asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Them too, so don’t be surprised if they act like this is totally normal because to them it is” Brad elaborated.<br />
<br />
“Aww this is the sweetest thing you’ve ever done for me and it’s not even our anniversary” Jan said giving the other toddler the biggest smile, “This is perfect now we can truly be together Brad, and I can also teach you how to be a baby again.”<br />
<br />
“How do I do that?” he asked perplexed.<br />
<br />
“It’s actually really easy, just do whatever you feel is right in the moment” Jan told him, “Let your babyish instincts take over, they’ll tell you what to do.”<br />
 <br />
Brad nodded before looking down at his baby toes which he just now noticed he had been playing with during the entire conversation. Suddenly an infantile urge to suck on them came over him and following Jan’s advice he embraced it whole heartedly by lifting his leg and sticking his tiny foot in his mouth. Rolling onto his back he sucked on the tiny digits without a care in the world, the blissful feelings of babyhood overtaking him. As Brad nibbled and slobbered on his toes with his baby teeth a new source of pleasure came in the form of a rapidly increasing warmness on his crotch. It took him but a second to realize he was peeing himself but he wasn’t at all worried since he was wearing a diaper. He could already feel it doing its job, absorbing the steady stream of liquid he forced into it as of a result of him emptying his bladder. When he finished going he removed his foot from his mouth and sat up, gazing down to see the yellow tinted front of his padding.<br />
<br />
Standing up he admired the way the wet pamper now sagged between his legs, so full and heavy with his pee. Wanting to strut his stuff Brad began to toddle around the playpen confidently showing off his saggy diaper before eventually coming to a stop right next to the stuffed animals. He then let himself fall back onto the pile, lying back as he enjoyed the warmth of the ocean he had just made in his pants. Jan giggled as he crawled over to her baby husband with a grin on her face at how easily he took to having an accident.<br />
<br />
“Feels nice doesn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Brad just nodded still too caught up in the bliss of using his diaper for the first time in 33 years.<br />
<br />
“Making pee pee is alright, but the real good stuff is when you make a poo poo.”<br />
<br />
Forgetting his soaked padding for the moment Brad looked at the other with interest, “Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah making a stinky is the best thing ever!” Jan exclaimed, “The way it feels when it comes out and your diaper catches it, holding it against your bottom…it’s like heaven. You can feel it back there all the time” she said while patting the seat of her pamper. “As for the smell it may bother you at first but you’ll get use to it trust me. I actually love the smell of my dirty diapers now.”<br />
<br />
Brad giggled at his wife’s explanation of the joys of crapping one’s pants and the way she used such childish words for going number two.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry honey if you’re anything like me it won’t be long before you make poopie” Jan reassured.<br />
<br />
He gave her a grateful smile before going back to relaxing while rubbing the front of his used diaper, having a good feeling he was going to enjoy being in them this second time around.</p>
