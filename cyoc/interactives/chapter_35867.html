<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'I wonder why Daisy doesn't have this medallion anymore' Steve thought. 'I could use it to transform myself but what would I buy? I need some help. I think I know who can help me. I just hope that she remembers me.'<br />
<br />
Making up his mind he grabbed his coat and headed to Daisy's house.<br />
<br />
Going up to the door he paused for a second. He had to ask himself if he was doing the right thing. He was about to his friends mother to help him transform into a seven year old girl. He didn't know if it was right or not but he was determined to see it through. Before he could knock, the door opened and Daisy's mom looked at him in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Miss Punnit&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello Steve&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;What brings you here? It can't be because you want to see Daisy since you've been avoiding her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember me?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I forget you?&quot; Miss Punnit asked. &quot;You were Daisy's best friend when she was Declan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to be her best friend&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a funny way of showing it&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;Daisy has been heartbroken because you've been avoiding her. She has new friends now but none of them are her best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Daisy home?&quot; Steve asked. &quot;I have something to tell her that will make her happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not here&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;Denise took her to a party one of her new friends is having.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still have the medallion?&quot; Steve asked suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why no we don't&quot; Miss Punnit replied. &quot;We lost it someplace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I found it and I want your help&quot; Steve said. &quot;I want to become a seven year old girl so Daisy and I can be best friends again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have the medallion?&quot; Miss Punnit asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; Steve replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you give me the medallion back I'll help you&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;Have you told your parents what you're planning on doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet&quot; Steve admitted. &quot;I figured that I'd wait and see if you would help me. They won't believe it unless they see me transform themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll have to invite them over to watch it then&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;I was just about to go to the store and pick up a few things. Do you want to come with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
About an hour later they were back and Miss Punnit was cooking supper. She had bought a brand new package of little girl undies which were sitting beside Steve at the moment. Miss Punnit had told Steve that this was the safest way since no little girl had worn these before so he would transform into a little girl version of himself. She had called his parents and invited them over for supper which they accepted. Denise was suppose to be back anytime now with Daisy, Katie, and Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve&quot; Miss Punnit shouted from the kitchen. &quot;What did Declan's friends think when he didn't show up for school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't remember Declan&quot; Steve said coming into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Miss Punnit asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Steve said. &quot;When I had asked them about Declan they were like 'Who's Declan?'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also noticed that people didn't remember Declan&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;It started after we legally changed Daisy's name and age. I had thought that you had forgotten also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost wish that I had&quot; Steve said. &quot;As it was I was avoiding her because people might think that I was a pervert or something else. Besides it would have been awkward talking about our lives now. It was awkward when she had told me what she did to get me to believe her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then they heard the front door open and Denise call &quot;Mom, we're home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Punnit and Steve left the kitchen and headed to the front door. When they saw them Miss Punnit said &quot;We're having guests over for supper so I want you girls on your best behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy was looking at Steve with a mix of emotion on her face. She walked up to Steve and then punched him in the stomach as hard as she could. It wasn't that hard but Steve was caught off guard and her punch knocked the wind out of him for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooof&quot; Steve said as his breath left him. As soon as he caught his breath again he asked &quot;What was that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You boogerhead&quot; Daisy said. &quot;You know what it was for. You say our friendship would be awkward but you don't even try to be my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daisy I want to be friends&quot; Steve said. &quot;It hurt me to stay away but I thought that it was for the best. Think about it, a sixteen year old boy being friends with a seven year old girl. People would think that I was some sort of freak or pervert. That would mean that the police could get involved and the result would be the same. I wouldn't be seeing you in that situation anyway. Not only that but they would insist on having you examined to see if I had molested you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn't find anything&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that but neither of us needs to go through that when I could just stay away&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have said you were dating Karen&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have a boyfriend Daisy&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daisy, Steve has something that will make you happy&quot; Miss Punnit said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; Daisy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've decided to become a seven year old girl too&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you going to do that?&quot; Denise asked. &quot;We don't have the medallion any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I found it&quot; Steve said. &quot;I'm going to use it to transform myself into a seven year old girl. Unless Daisy wants to use it to return to a sixteen year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy shakes her head and says &quot;I'm happy being a seven year old girl. I had always been a sissy behind closed doors. When I chatted on line I pretended to be any female to would allow me to act and talk as a female. I was even on Second Life and one of my avatars forms was a seven year old girl. Of course all of it's forms were female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never heard of Second Life&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like a chat and game hybrid&quot; Daisy said. &quot;There is no goal other than to have fun. You can build things, chat with friends, and of course pretend to be someone you're not or make your avatar as close to the real you as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds neat&quot; Karen said. &quot;I should look into it and see if I can get my friends to get it. How much does it cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Second Life is a free program&quot; Daisy said. &quot;Though if you pay a monthly fee you can 'own' Second Life land. That's on the main grid though. I don't know about the teen grid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teen grid&quot; Karen said with a quizzical look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Daisy said a bit uncomfortably. &quot;When you're a teen you're suppose to be using Teen Second Life. Anyone over 18 is not allowed on that grid without permission from Linden Labs. Teens aren't suppose to be on the main grid period.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get on there then?&quot; Miss Punnit asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I signed up they didn't check ages like they do now&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I get that you're happy being a seven year old girl now&quot; Steve said. &quot;So I'm going to transform myself into a seven year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to do that Steve&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright&quot; Steve said. &quot;Besides, I'm curious what about being a girl appealed to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just liked the feel of female clothes&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It had to be something much deeper than that&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve, your parents should be here any moment&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;I'll ask you one more time. Are you sure that you want to transform and in front of your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then&quot; Miss Punnit said. &quot;I need to check on dinner. I hope that you'll be happy as a girl Steve. Daisy adjusted easily but I'm not sure you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine Miss Punnit&quot; Steve said. &quot;I'll be able to change back if I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you'll have a couple of days to decide since it's Friday&quot; Miss Punnit said heading back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Steve, Daisy, Katie, Karen, Denise, and Miss Punnit were sitting in the living room when there was a knock on the door. Miss Punnit went to answer it and came back with Steve's parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for inviting us over Alice&quot; Steve's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my pleasure Jenny&quot; Alice said. &quot;We haven't had dinner together in awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I must admit that I was surprised when Jenny told me that you had invited us over&quot; Steve's father said. &quot;I see you're still single.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't start that again Joe&quot; Jenny said. &quot;It's no wonder that she doesn't invite us over more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still say that all her boyfriends dieing after they got her pregnant is suspicious&quot; Joe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe will you please stop this&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Her daughters are in the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know very well that I never received anything for myself upon their deaths&quot; Alice said. &quot;All they had went into a college fund for my kids and I can't touch it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe didn't say anything to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I'm still amazed at how much Daisy looks like Katie even though they have different fathers&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So am I&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom , Dad, there's something you should know&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it honey?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about Daisy&quot; Steve said. &quot;She used to be a guy my age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be ridiculous&quot; Joe said. &quot;Don't you think that we would remember if she was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For some reason most people don't remember my son&quot; Alice said. &quot;The only ones that remember are me, my daughters, Steve, and of course Daisy herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling alright Alice?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine&quot; Alice said. &quot;And before you say it Joe, I'm not on drugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right&quot; Joe said. &quot;Jenny, Steve, we're leaving. She's obviously on drugs and she slipped you some too. I'm calling the cops right now so you can be placed where you belong. Behind bars.&quot;<br />
<br />
As his dad stated dialing the police Steve said &quot;We can prove that it's true Dad. I'm going to transform myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve put the medallion around his neck and picked up one of the new panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing with that?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch&quot; Steve simply said as he touched the panties to the medallion. A blue spark went between them and Steve's body began to tingle. He started to shrink and his hair started to lengthen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I want to report someone using drugs around children&quot; Joe said into his phone seemingly unaware of his son's transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, she's not using drugs&quot; Steve said in a higher pitched voice. He was much shorter now and he was trying to hold his pants and underwear up. He could feel his genitals tingling and pulling inside him to transform into their female counterparts. By the time his transformation to a seven year old girl was complete his father was done talking to the police.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I must be hallucinating&quot; Joe said. &quot;I could swear that I just saw Steve transform into a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then we're both hallucinating&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I saw Steve transform into a little girl too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can this be?&quot; Joe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This medallion has the power to transform people&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just great&quot; Joe said. &quot;The police are on their way here. What are we going to tell them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daisy, Karen, take Steve upstairs and see if you can find him some clothes&quot; Alice said. &quot;Give me the medallion first Steve. I'll call Dr. Mezzner and see if she can do anything within a few minutes. I have a feeling that she's responsible for everybody forgetting about Declan. Well get to it you three.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve handed the medallion to Alice and then let his pants and underwear slide off of him. As he stepped out of his shoes, socks, pants, and underwear he took off his shirt. He then ran naked up to Daisy's room clutching the panties he had used to transform himself. Daisy and Karen were right behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do with Steve's clothes?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go put them in the trunk&quot; Joe said as he gathered up Steve's clothes. &quot;I wish I hadn't called the police now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Joe was outside Alice was able to get a hold of Dr. Mezzner. &quot;Hello Dr. Mezzner, this is Alice Punnit&quot; she said. &quot;I hope you remember me. We have a little problem that I think you can help us with. A friend of mine called the police thinking that I was using drugs when we told him about Daisy being Declan before. I think you can somehow change people's memories since just about everyone forgot about Declan shortly after we saw you. Can you do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe came back in just as Alice was hanging up. &quot;Well can this Dr. Mezzner do anything?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll do what she can but she can't promise anything on such short notice&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess we wait for the police to show up&quot; Joe said. &quot;That should be at most ten minutes.&quot;</p>
