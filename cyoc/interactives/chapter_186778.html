<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Tom came to, a brief wave of confusion washed over him. He couldn’t move at all, yet he didn’t feel restrained; it was more like lying in bed with sleep paralysis still in effect. All he could see was two bare feet at the ends of a pair of shapely legs and thighs that dominated both sides of his vision, as though they went on forever shielding him from the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
As those legs began walking over what looked to be carpet, Tom suddenly remembered what he had been doing. He had used the Chronivac to turn himself into a cat that belonged to Bella, his sexy neighbor, and her cat into a rubber toy. Thinking back, he never specified exactly what toy for the cat to become, nor that he should become the cat she already had. He started to worry that something had gone seriously wrong that would explain his bizarre position, but his worries were alleviated when he remembered the 2-hour time limit on his transformation. Only when Bella entered a different room, one with tile floor, could Tom get a look at himself in the reflection of the marble finish.<br />
<br />
Bearing witness to what he had become made him feel like the world’s biggest idiot. He had told the Chronivac to make him Bella’s pussy, thus it made him her vagina. Why, did I not specify to be her cat? How could I make such a blunder? How am I going to explore her home from between her legs? Questions flew through his head at a million miles a minute. At least he would be able to enjoy seeing her naked body, if only as nothing more than her reproductive organ.<br />
<br />
“Where is that cat… I just heard her?” asked Bella to no one in particular. She looked around the master bathroom, having sworn she just heard a sharp meow. She had planned to bathe while her boyfriend was at work. Figuring that the cat must have left, Bella proceeded to the shower. <br />
<br />
Tom only being able to see the ground got a little excited when he realized that he would be joining his neighbor for a shower, only to quickly remember that he couldn’t see anything but her legs nor could he touch himself in any meaningful way. His disappointment was slightly relaxed as warm water began dripping over him. That relaxation only lasted a moment, when he felt a shift and some liquid began pouring out near when his vision was focused. The total relaxing of muscles and the release of tension in his body revealed to him that Bella was the type to pee in the shower. Tom thought that it was at least somewhat erotic that she was peeing though him.<br />
<br />
Once Bella had finished her shower, which Tom saw as mostly uneventful save for the few seconds when she cleaned his lips, she got out and wrapped herself in a towel. Only then did she notice, sitting idly tucked behind the toilet, a giant white dildo. She bent down and picked it up, wondering where it came from. It couldn’t be any less that 10 inches in length. The monstrous rubber dildo made her thoughts fall on her boyfriend and the night she knew they would be enjoying together. Tom couldn’t see what was going on, but he could tell that some fluid began building up inside his body. It felt like his mouth was full of saliva, but he couldn’t swallow.<br />
<br />
Tom saw Bella’s towel fall to the ground as she entered her bedroom. After she took a seat on the bed, Tom could finally see a bit of his surroundings. Everything looked huge, he felt like he was the size of a bug. He saw a mirror on the wall, and Bella staring down between her spread legs. She was biting her lip, while holding her dildo in her right hand. Tom could just make out the sheen of fluid that was on her pussy lips, his pussy lips. His view was obstructed when Bella began rubbing her fingers over Tom’s clit. Tom was thoroughly turned on now, fluids now flowed like drool. He could feel the same pleasure Bella was feeling but across his entire body. Waves of ecstasy washed over him, then Bella took her dildo and rubbed the tip over Tom, like she was teasing him. Tom sat in anticipation until she pushed the whole shaft in and began thrusting.<br />
<br />
Juice from his lips created a glistening layer on the outside of the dildo. The way she tickled his clit felt like all the sweetness of a thousand chocolate bars had been placed on the tip of his tongue. And as Bella brushed the tip over his G-spot, the feeling of a hundred warm blankets wrapped around him on a cold winter day brushed over him. When these were pulled together, Tom felt absolute euphoria, his whole life had been nothing more than a dream leading up to this moment, a moment of utter bliss.<br />
<br />
So lost in pleasure, Tom didn’t realize that this was the female orgasm, the first one he had ever felt. Meanwhile Bella was just winding down, lying in bed, dildo in hand, and completely out of breath. She took a tissue and wiped off what was left of her juices on Tom’s lips. Tom was still in an almost comatose state, just barely quivering when touched. <br />
<br />
Bella continued to clean up the mess she had made and began getting ready for her boyfriend getting home. She put on a pair of panties then pantyhose over top, obstructing Tom’s view of the ground, leaving him to only hear and guess as to what she was doing. Tom, in his lingering daze, heard the rustling of fabric and the zipping of zippers. Then the was a loud clack, a sound he knew so well that he could recognize she was wearing a pair of heals. She must be going out. That was his only thought.<br />
<br />
Bella continued downstairs still wondering where her cat was hiding. She sat on the couch in the living room. She just scrolled through her phone for a long while. Tom enjoyed the relaxing feeling of pressure while he sat between Bella’s crossed legs. Suddenly, a door opened, and Tom felt shifts as Bella began walking. But before more could happen, he felt a vibrating through his body, as everything went grey.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Tom was back in his room. Like before he was hit with a bit of confusion, on where he was. Once he came to his senses, he looked at his computer, at the Chronivac. Remembering of all the pleasure he had, he considered all the pleasure he had yet to feel. He could only think of how much he longed to feel that pleasure again, and all the new fantasies he now possessed. His longing turned to resolve. With his head full of lust and a dick full of blood Tom typed away, ready to fulfil one of his new transformation fantasies.</p>
