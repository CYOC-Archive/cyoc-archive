<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve walked over to check that the door to the bathroom was firmly locked.  He didn’t expect that anyone was going to try to come in, but there was no reason to chance it.  Targeting himself with the app, Steve generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
“Steve is wondering what to do.”<br />
<br />
Well, that was true.  Steve was very curious how he should change himself.  Should he pick a specific species?  No, there was something about the thrill of not knowing and, after his successful test with the addict, he didn’t want to risk things by making a different change to himself.  Steve changed “man is” to “anthropomorphic animal” and watched as the sentence changed to:<br />
<br />
“The anthropomorphic animal is wondering what to do.”<br />
<br />
Steve suddenly felt woozy, detached, and a bit nauseous.  He’d barely managed to hit the submit button on the app and now standing upright felt like a significant challenge.  Frightened that he might drop the phone, Steve squatted and gently placed the phone down on the ground – just in time to see a light coating of grey fuzz grow out over his slendering hands.<br />
<br />
The world began spinning and Steve collapsed onto his hands and knees to the feeling of an unfamiliar weight pulling down on the top of his head.  Two small grey objects began swaying in the very top of Steve’s field of view, and he managed to get a hand off of the ground and into position to feel the two rabbit ears that were now stuck to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
The floor began rushing up towards him and Steve planted his hand firmly back down onto the floor, only to feel a surge of pressure coming from just underneath his bellybutton.  Looking down, the first thing that Steve noticed was that in place of the blue t-shirt he’d been wearing, there was now a black piece of clothing that only seemed to cover his upper chest.  The next thing that Steve saw – and felt – was the cream-colored fur on his belly expanding outwards as his stomach bloated beneath it.<br />
<br />
Was he getting fatter?  Steve didn’t know what it felt like to be fat, but this still felt different somehow.  There was so much pressure in his belly, it was like something was inside of him that shouldn’t be there and then, to make matters worse, he felt a small but firm object press up against the front of his spine.  Not the back of spine – the front, the side that was pointed towards his belly, as though there was something else inside of his belly moving around.<br />
<br />
Steve’s confusion only increased when he felt his cock go flaccid.  Not that he’d been erect before, but this was like an overwhelming feeling of utter impotence.  It wasn’t something he’d ever experienced before, and it almost felt like his cock was shrinking as it drew up inside of him…”<br />
<br />
Moving his hand towards his belly, Steve felt his nipples firm up and begin pressing out into the crop top on his chest as his vision of his bloated stomach began to be obscured by the two mounds swelling out of his chest.  However, that didn’t stop Steve’s hand from continuing down, slipping under the waistband of the yoga pants he was wearing, and grabbing on to his diminished dick.<br />
<br />
It felt so much smaller than he used to, and his delicate, feminine fingers desperately latched onto it.  He could feel it pulling back into his body and he tried to pull it out, as though that would somehow arrest what was happening or even restore it to how it had been.  But Steve’s efforts were in vain as the tiny nub simply shrunk out of fingers and pulled back, forming Steve’s new clit as the skin underneath it pulled apart to form the walls of his tight rabbit cunt.<br />
<br />
“No!  No!  This isn’t what I wanted!” Steve shouted in a groggy, but decidedly girly and submissive voice.  But his protestations were for nothing as, just like the man before him, a hole appeared in her yoga pants and small tail puffed out.  Then the last change hit as his mouth grew out into a small muzzle and Steve felt his tongue pressing up against the back of two buck teeth.<br />
<br />
Steve’s changes finished and he was left as a petite, pregnant rabbit girl laying on her hands and knees on the bathroom floor.  But while Steve had assumed that his disorientation was the result of the transformation, he didn’t seem to come back to his senses now that it was over.<br />
<br />
The world kept spinning and pulsating to the point that it was even hard to maintain his current position.  Flopping over onto his side, Steve’s body felt warm but distant.  He could feel something squirming around inside of his belly and there was a distinct aching in his lower back, but neither of those things seemed to bother him.  <br />
<br />
There was almost a tinge of euphoria running through his mind.  He couldn’t concentrate, and his body felt slow and uncoordinated.  Plus, his stomach just felt like it should be uncomfortable, but for some reason nothing seemed to bother him.  He’d felt this way one before, back when he’d had his wisdom teeth removed, and they’d prescribed him painkillers…<br />
<br />
Steve tried to connect the dots, but he just couldn’t concentrate enough to figure out what was going on.  With a monumental amount of effort, Steve managed to paw at his phone until he felt it slip into his palm.  Rolling over on his back, he held it up in front of him.<br />
<br />
Like the rest of the world, the phone seemed to pulsate as it looked distant and out of focus.  Steve saw the countdown timer in the top of the app – 58 seconds.  Had it really only been 2 seconds since the change finished?  It didn’t matter, he could still generate a sentence even if he couldn’t change it.  Steve selected himself and hit generate:<br />
<br />
“The pregnant anthropomorphic rabbit is starting to feel the effect of the pills she took with her husband.”<br />
<br />
Fuck.  Steve slowly looked around the room until he saw the purse sitting at his feet.  He tried to grab it, but his body was so slow and tired.  What should have been a simple act turned into a comedy of errors as Steve clumsily spun his body around and then pawed at the purse.  Finally, grabbing it, Steve managed to unzip it and look inside.<br />
<br />
Fumbling through its contents, Steve saw a lot of feminine products that he wasn’t particularly familiar with – makeup pens, a tampon, a small mirror, and other things that only a girl would use – until he came across an orange pill bottle.  Holding it up to his face, he saw the words “OxyContin” on the label.  Just great, the app had turned him into some sort of pregnant drug addict who was high on opioids.<br />
<br />
How much of these had he taken?  The bottle looked about half full, but Steve had no idea how many had been it in before he and his “husband” had taken them.  On top of that, there was the other pill bottle that he’s seen walking into the room – had Steve taken anything from that as well?  All Steve knew was that, since he couldn’t get his body off the floor, he had probably taken a lot of whatever cocktail was now flowing through his blood.<br />
<br />
Steve kept rummaging through the purse until he found a driver’s license, but as he started to pull the license out he realized just how tired he was.  His entire body felt like it was made of lead and the idea of closing his eyes felt so appealing, even if just for a second.  Still on his back, Steve’s hand with the license in it collapsed onto his right breast as his eyes closed and he felt himself drifting off into a warm, tingly placed.<br />
<br />
*THUMP*<br />
<br />
Something inside of his slammed into the back of his belly button, causing his entire body to involuntarily spasm.  That, combined with the strange sensation of his vaginal walls clenching together, brought Steve at least partially back to reality.<br />
<br />
“Uhhhnnn.”  Steve let out a feminine moan as he opened his eyes.  He was so tired, but he couldn’t fall asleep.  With how high he was, Steve had no idea when he would manage to wake up.  Were it not for the shocking sensations coming from his new female anatomy, Steve might have ended up in the same position as the man next to him.  That wouldn’t be good if a janitor came to clean the bathroom and discovered the two of them in here.  <br />
<br />
After all, anthropomorphic animals didn’t exist, so what would happen if two were discovered in a mall bathroom?  Would they be taken away to be experimented on?  That wasn’t a question that Steve wanted to find out the answer to.<br />
<br />
“Ding.”  The noise from the phone told Steve that the timer was up.  He looked at the sentence he’d previously generated about himself, but it was too long and complicated for his brain to figure out how to begin fixing his current predicament.  Generating another sentence, Steve felt a dull sensation in his lower abdomen, followed by a feeling of intense dampness inside of his cunt.  Still, it all felt so dull and distant, so rather than focusing on it, Steve looked at the phone and saw:<br />
<br />
“The high anthropomorphic rabbit’s water just broke.”</p>
