<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shawna was going over how to get them back to Qirmallah. She knew that the only viable solution would be to create a portal to Qirmallah, but since magic was so weak on this planet that wasn't looking like it would be possible. If only she had someone here that was proficient in using magic no matter how weak. Just then there was a knock at the door. Shawna cautiously went over to it and peered<br />
out the peep hole.<br />
<br />
Standing in the hallway was a man with his back to the door. He was looking around like he expected someone to jump him. There was something about him that felt familiar to Shawna so she opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I help you?&quot; Shawna asked when she opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to hear your voice again sis&quot; the man said with his back to her. He picked up a bag that was by his feet and backed into the apartment.<br />
<br />
Shawna closed the door and asked &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not surprised that you don't recognize me sis&quot; the guy said. &quot;My name that I have been going by is Rick. I sensed that you had finally changed back to yourself yesterday and I immediately set out to find you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that I'm your sister but I have no siblings&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew that you wouldn't remember me&quot; Rick said. &quot;You ordered me to block your memory of me when the attack on Qirmallah first happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you know about Qirmallah&quot; Shawna said. She was starting to get a little suspicious about this guy. She did not have any siblings at all. &quot;Perhaps your one of the attackers and you've come to curse me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These should jog your memory&quot; Rick said. He pulls out a simple looking necklace with a brown triangle and ivory stripe down the center, and what appeared to be half a fossilized bird head. &quot;Are they jogging your memory?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do look familiar&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing else?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, nothing else&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you'll need to see me in order for your memory of me to return&quot; Rick said. He put the necklace on and it began to glow with a powder blue light. Rick's clothes disappeared in a flash of that same blue light. The light then spread to cover his whole body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body doesn't impress me&quot; Shawna said, &quot;I'm a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know sis&quot; Rick said in a slightly higher voice. &quot;This is just the beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shawna didn't understand how this was suppose to convince her that he was her sibling. As she continued to watch however Rick's body started to change. The first obvious change was his body hair receded into his body then the real transformation started. His feet became smaller and daintier. The change continued up his legs slimming them and making them more feminine. It reached his genitals and Shawna could see his balls being drawn into his body as his ball sack shrunk. His penis shrunk down and became a clitoris as his shrunken ball sack formed feminine lips. His new genitals moved back a little to the proper place for a female. His butt grew out a bit. The change continued up to his hips which widened a bit. His waist slimmed as his stomach flattened. His chest was the next thing to change. Two mounds started to push out from his chest. They grew until they were size c breasts. As the change continued his shoulders narrowed. His arms slimmed and became more feminine and his hands became smaller and daintier. His fingernails grew out a little beyond the tips of his fingers. The change then continued up his neck making it thinner. When it reached his face it made his face more of an oval shape from his roundish face. His lips plumped up a bit as his nose became smaller and narrower. His eyebrows thinned and took on a more feminine shape. Finally the change reached the top of his head and his hair. His hair changed from brown to platinum blond and grew down to his waist. As it grew it became curly. His skin remained the same white color that it was before. During the change his height had changed going from 5 foot 8 to 5 foot 6. Once the changes were done another flash of that powder<br />
blue light left him clothed in a flowing powder blue silk robe. The light faded from the necklace and Shawna just stared at what Rick had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember me now sis?&quot; the former Rick asked in a higher voice than he had while the transformation was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rainna!&quot; Shawna exclaimed as she embraced her. &quot;I'm sorry I forgot about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok sis&quot; Rainna said, &quot;it was because of the spell I put on you that you didn't remember me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I ordered you to do that&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you were trying to protect me from the Barbarians of Barduu&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't look like that happened&quot; Shawna said. &quot;They cursed you as they did Dani, Jayu, and myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't exactly curse me&quot; Rainna said. &quot;They were able to capture me in a magical trap and they destroyed my staff. They were going to execute me but before they could I was able to break the magical bindings they had placed on me. I used my magic to send myself to where they had sent you. Unfortunately their sorcerers interrupted my casting and I ended up being a five year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that means you've been in that horrid male body for a long time&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;For close to 30 years&quot; Rainna said. &quot;That isn't the worst part for me. My memory was affected so that I believed that I was Rick. I even had sex with women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must have been horrible for you since you're straight&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now it is but at the time I didn't know who I really was&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you remember who you were?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesterday&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My transformation must have triggered your memory&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I thought when it happened&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
Just then the door opened and Dani and Jayu entered with Jerry. When Jayu saw Rainna she knelt down and said &quot;My lady, it's so good to see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sure is good to see you again Rain&quot; Dani said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on here?&quot; Jerry asked. &quot;I thought that your queen was named Shawna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rainna is Shawna's sister&quot; Dani explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't look black&quot; Jerry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I'm not&quot; Rainna said, &quot;I am white.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how can you be Shawna's sister?&quot; Jerry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her mother took me in when the Barbarians of Barduu killed my parents&quot; Rainna explained. &quot;She had insisted that I was a part of her family from that moment on and treated me as such. I was very young when my parents died so I was able to adjust quite easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you were adopted then&quot; Jerry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's something like adoption but without all the red tape that they have here on this planet&quot; Rainna said. &quot;Now, perhaps you could tell us your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I used to be Jerry&quot; Jerry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is your name now?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told that you would give me my new name&quot; Jerry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that isn't something that the queen does&quot; Shawna said. &quot;That is a job for the High Witch which is Rainna. The High Witch always names new Amazons in our culture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is my new name?&quot; Jerry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it will be Jerruunta&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a fine name&quot; Shawna said. &quot;Welcome to Amazonhood Jerruunta. You now have a very long life ahead of you. In fact you are almost immortal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jerruunta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way that you'll die is if someone kills you or you have an accident&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's awesome!&quot; Jerruunta exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you two come back here?&quot; Shawna asked. &quot;You should be out recruiting more Amazons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive us my queen&quot; Jayu said, &quot;but we suddenly had this irresistible feeling come over us that we should come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would have been because of my transformation&quot; Rainna said. &quot;You needed to see me in order for your memory of me to return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive us for not remembering you my lady&quot; Jayu said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing to forgive&quot; Rainna said. &quot;It was not your fault that you forgot me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should have remembered you&quot; Dani said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had ordered her to block our memories of her&quot; Shawna said. &quot;I did that in the hopes that it would protect her from the barbarians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it didn't work&quot; Dani said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it didn't&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is your staff my lady?&quot; Jayu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The barbarians destroyed it&quot; Rainna said, &quot;though I do have a piece that couldn't be destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the bird head fossil?&quot; Dani asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but only one half of it&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you show her what you brought with you Jerruunta&quot; Dani suggested.<br />
<br />
Jerruunta pulled out a fossilized bird head and said &quot;I found this a few years ago and picked it up. I never knew why I picked it up but I've kept it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's the other half of my bird guide&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess it's rightfully yours&quot; Jerruunta said as she handed it to Rainna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all I need is some type of pole&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have something that will work for you my lady&quot; Jayu said and she went into one of the bedrooms. When she returned she was carrying a wooden rod that was about as tall as Rainna was. It was thin enough that Rainna could easily hold it. &quot;Will this work my lady?&quot; Jayu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it will Jayu, thank you&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my please my lady&quot; Jayu said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you need some type of crystal for your staff?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have one sis&quot; Rainna said. She reached into the bag she brought and pulled out a small quartz crystal. She then took the two halves of the fossil and put them together. She put the fossil down and the two halves remained together. She took the pole and put the crystal on top. While she held the crystal and pole together with one hand she picked up the fossil with the other. She slipped the open end of the fossil over the pole and crystal. There was a<br />
flash of powder blue light and Rainna's staff was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you look like the Rain I know&quot; Dani said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You three need to go out and recruit more Amazons&quot; Shawna said. &quot;Rain and I will work on getting us back to Qirmallah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course my queen&quot; Jayu said as she knelt down in front of Shawna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll miss you&quot; Dani said and then she passionately kissed Shawna.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Jayu, Dani, and the newest Amazon Jerruunta left Shawna turned to Rainna and asked &quot;Do you have any ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The best way would be to create a portal&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my thought too but magic is so weak on this planet&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are places on this planet that are strong with magic&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What places are those?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The best known place is Stonehenge&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn't that built as some type of observatory?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's one theory the people of this planet have come up with&quot; Rainna said. &quot;It's easy to see why they would think that since celestial bodies do line up with it the openings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you say that it's a place of strong magic&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is&quot; Rainna said. &quot;The people of this planet don't believe magic exists so they don't even consider the possibility that Stonehenge might have been built to concentrate magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These people are so dumb&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They'd say the same thing about us sis&quot; Rainna said. &quot;Of course they could say that we were crazy and put us in psychiatric therapy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will change in a few months when the Chronivac becomes available to the general public&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be here when that happens&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I&quot; Shawna said, &quot;so let's figure out how to get back to Qirmallah. I don't think we'll be able to use Stonehenge for the portal. It will be too small to use as a portal for the force I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there is an area that I believe will work&quot; Rainna said. &quot;It's an area of the Atlantic Ocean called the Bermuda Triangle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the area that ships and plains are suppose to have disappeared in isn't it?&quot; Shawna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right sis&quot; Rainna said. &quot;We could charter one or two cruise ships to take us to the triangle. Once there I could open a portal to take us back to Qirmallah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one problem though&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that&quot; Shawna said with a little groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that barbarians could be here&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why you had your back to the door&quot; Shawna said. &quot;Why would they be here though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that they want to take over this planet as well&quot; Rainna said. &quot;In fact I think they may be behind the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that as a possibility&quot; Shawna said. &quot;What better way to take over a planet. People will be transforming others into roaches if they're annoyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to be chaos here&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can help this planet after we free Qirmallah&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if this planet is worth helping&quot; Rainna said. &quot;The people on this planet aren't much better than barbarians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some who are worthy of our help&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;True but I think those will choose to become Amazons&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
Shawna laughed and said &quot;I bet they will.&quot;</p>
