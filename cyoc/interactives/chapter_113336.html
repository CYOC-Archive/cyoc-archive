<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick was immediately aware that he had jumped too fast, but the girl just looked at him with a measuring look, and said, &quot;You&#39;re sure. You aren&#39;t going to back out. This isn&#39;t a painless treatment. You can still back out if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick immediately knew that she would think he was a coward if he changed his mind over a little pain, even though she hadn&#39;t said anything. Besides, it would be painful if he had to do it the long way around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Your best strength and running treatments.&quot;<br />
<br />
She still made him sign his name on the form.  He wondered if he should have told his parents, but they had always given him a lot of leeway -- he was a very mature kid at fifteen.  Still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you please let my parents know when they get back that I&#39;m in the spa? If they get back before we&#39;re done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the girl said. &quot;Call me Hebe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick remembered his Greek myths from the quick read on the way here.  &quot;After the goddess of youth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; she said, leading him to a closed door. &quot;You did your reading.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You ended up marrying Hercules?&quot; He meant that as a joke, because clearly this couldn&#39;t be the real Hebe, the goddess, because this place was really ... well, wait, if they could really make the changes they said. Maybe they were more than just ... but that&#39;s impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did. In fact, my sons Alex and Nic will be doing the massage.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him, and it was so brilliant that he felt confused and dizzy, yet at the same time, he felt incredibly good, strong and energetic and happy.  OK, so she was Hebe.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Derrick,&quot; she said to the two identical young men who waited inside. They looked to be about the same age as Derrick, but much more fit, like weightlifters or gymnasts or gymnasts who lifted weights -- but that was kind of to-be-expected if they were really Hercules&#39; sons.  Derrick said a &quot;hi&quot; that came out more as a squeak, but they looked at him with a nearly-carnivorous grin and said, &quot;What&#39;s he&quot;  &quot;in for?&quot;  in a twin-trick that made Derrick snort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Running and strength.&quot;  Hebe smiled that brain-melting smile again and said, &quot;You enjoy your massage, Derrick.&quot;<br />
<br />
He almost didn&#39;t notice when they picked him up like a toy and pulled his shoes and socks off, then stripped off his clothes. It seemed perfectly reasonable for them to do that in his haze of well-being from that smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, off with the boxers, too,&quot; one of them said. He had a polo shirt that had &#39;alex&#39; stitched on it. The other one, apparently Nic, was rummaging through a cupboard pulling out some bottles and jugs.  A hot-water kettle whistled, and Nic did something with leaves and a cup and the hot water, and a smell like fresh hay and cinnamon spread through the room.<br />
<br />
Derrick pulled off his boxers, and Alex wrapped a thin towel around his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now drink this down,&quot; Nic said, holding out a gleaming white sea-shell which had an aromatic something in it.  He accepted it and sipped it back. It had a slight flavor of apple as well, and he felt even better, but increasingly hot and flushed and was pretty sure he was getting drunk, though the drink hadn&#39;t tasted of alcohol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the first thing we&#39;re going to do,&quot; Nic said, as Alex laid him back on a massage table, angled slightly with the knees up and the head slightly raised, &quot;Is to wrap you in an herbal wrap that will help open you up for the work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cloths they laid on him were almost too hot, but they felt good after a moment, and when his chest, arms, and thighs were covered, they laid one on his neck, and another on his face, making sure he could breathe. The little noises were accompanied by gentle touches to his body, not hard but not ticklishly soft, and he found himself relaxing and feeling aroused, and then they put a hot cloth across his rapidly erecting dick and he felt like he should protest, but they wrapped the cloth he was lying on around him, and flipped him onto his stomach then, and he was lying on a different table. The cloth came open behind him and he felt their hands moving gently across his back, his shoulders, putting down more of the nearly-too-hot herbal wraps and he was falling asleep with the sense of relaxation.  He started to feel like he was dreaming.<br />
<br />
They were talking, but he couldn&#39;t understand what they were saying, and the tingling sensation from the herbs was becoming so intense he couldn&#39;t really tell what was happening. He felt disconnected from his body while at the same time, he was intensely attached to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to pull a bit,&quot; he heard one of them say. He couldn&#39;t tell which, their deep tenor voices were almost identical.<br />
<br />
He felt them, one at his head, the other at his feet, grabbing him with their strong grips, and then it did pull, they were both pulling hard on him, and it felt like he had to loosen up or they would tear him in half, but instead he felt himself stretching out. His imagination told him it was like he was made of taffy or something.  They pulled his shoulders, and he could imagine they were wider. They pulled his arms and torso and they felt longer. His legs, though, didn&#39;t feel stretched out, but more like they were swelling up. They did something with the table, and he felt his legs go over the side, his shins resting on a soft cushioned platform. The herbal compresses were still there, fizzing even more than they had been.  He noticed that something dropped away and his crotch was no longer being squeezed by the table, which didn&#39;t mean it was completely free; the cloths were still held against his abdominal muscles, and wrapped him in the pleasant tingling, but he was too relaxed to be more than halfway aroused, and the two strong young men wouldn&#39;t let him move by himself anyway. He was given another cup of something to drink; they held it to his lips as he was lying against the massage frame.  He felt the room change around him as whatever was in the drink took effect. It was like he was in a place that was too bright, but he was under some sort of tent, and there was a roaring noise like waves.  He felt something massive move near him, and three voices speaking, two familiar, one a profound deep bass.  He felt something touch him that was inexorably strong, incredibly controlled. His body responded to it without any choice.<br />
<br />
In the dream-world, he saw horses. Dozens of them, all different, and from different parts of the world. Some were small, some were light and lithe and thin, some he knew to be fast, but light, and then some looked odd, horses with muscles more like bulldogs or human muscle men. He liked some of how that looked. He heard the deep voice express approval, and the two lighter voices say no, something about a disease, and a thoughtful rumble and then there was a blinding light and heat, and another voice, and it was gone but he felt like something had burned out of him leaving him hollow and then something was pressing into him, finding its way into his insides from behind, but there wasn&#39;t pain like he&#39;d expect. He was too relaxed to feel anything but warm pleasure. It washed over him but didn&#39;t wane, just grew stronger, but he couldn&#39;t resist it at all.  After a while the ocean rhythms crashed and he felt something intense and hot fill him up, and he felt like he was swelling up, becoming metal like copper or bronze, hardening to iron.<br />
<br />
He felt hands then, pressing through his body on his muscles, everywhere they went leaving behind a hot emptiness that filled in as the heat expanded in him and solidified. He felt something weird going on with his insides; his legs felt odd and there was a strange popping sensation and he could feel them twice. The deeper voice leaned over him and whispered something in his ears and he felt the pressure inside him throb again and his body felt even more solid.<br />
<br />
The massage moved to his abdomen and he felt a wall of solid muscle traced out, a sensation like big rocks were being shoved around in his skin, and then he felt what seemed to be his chest again, below them and something that felt like arms and legs at the same time, and his hands? feet? they were stretched, the thumbs pushed in and around and everything became solid, dense, powerful, but bent differently. They moved to his ribcage again, and he felt something odd happening again, mostly powerful muscle in his back (again) and then his hips felt weird, and whatever was going into him became hotter, and his legs felt even stranger... he felt like they were pure muscle made out of jet engines and spring steel, the knees went in a different way, the shins and ankles changed, and he felt hard broad strong springs where his feet had been.<br />
<br />
The heat burst in him one last time, before it pulled away leaving him feeling hollow, but then something moved in and he felt himself grow tight around it, and something else began massaging the tingling into his balls and his dick felt like it was as big as his fist.  He began to feel the dream fading around him leaving him intensely horny and exhausted.  Someone was ... inside him. He was being fucked by one of the two brothers. The other one was down below doing something incredible to his cock, making it feel like lightning lived inside it.  His arms were chained in place, he heard the jingling and felt the cuffs, and he was standing on his stiff front legs while his rear legs danced around with the movements, and someone was pressing hard on pressure points in his back, someone else stroking and pressing spots inside his legs, and everything went into explosion land but this time he was aware of it.<br />
<br />
It went on for what felt like five or ten minutes, him gasping and panting around the braided leather halter tied in his mouth, and the brothers keeping him in a prolonged state of eruption. He felt like he was made of fire and lightning when they stopped, and he felt heavy and gasped for breath, but he wasn&#39;t exhausted, just winded.  They patted him on the shoulder below his waist, and one of them said, &quot;Hold still. We need to unfasten you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood, peculiarly stable. He felt like he should be dripping with sweat and other things, but he wasn&#39;t -- he was comfortable. Warm. Dry. He felt incredibly strong, and light though he also felt like he was packed in stone and metal.<br />
<br />
The  cloths came off him, and he felt warm water being washed over, cooling him off, being caught in the towels. It was still warm. He felt the chains holding his arms loosen, and he wondered when that had happened.  His arms felt strange, his back felt strange. Heavy. Bulky but somehow more flexible and light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Bring in the mirror, please.&quot;  That was probably Nic&#39;s voice. The one washing him down felt more like Alex. He heard someone come in, and his ears twitched, which surprised him a bit. He shifted his weight slightly, and Alex punched him very lightly in the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold still, I&#39;m not done yet,&quot; he said. His skin twitched all over from the punch, like goose-bumps, and it felt amazing and weird and good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your father decided to help,&quot; Hebe&#39;s voice said. &quot;I&#39;ll have to wind him back a bit, you know. His parents need to be able to recognize him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we take him to the gymnasion first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, fine. I&#39;ll mix an elixir for him to take when his parents are here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, Derrick,&quot; Nic said. &quot;We have a mirror for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick waited. He felt his arms rest at his side, and he felt how his back muscles held them slightly out, and how the shoulder girdle felt oddly wider, and he felt how his hands fell not against the legs he was used to, but against the shoulder of something else, but it wasn&#39;t something else, it was him.<br />
<br />
One of them -- Alex -- put his hands in the center of Derrick&#39;s back -- his second back -- and pushed himself up like a gymnast onto a pommel horse, and then stood on his back, barefoot. It made a faint twitch in Derrick&#39;s cock.  He felt something move behind him, twitch. Something brushed behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s doing that? That brushing thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see in a moment,&quot; Alex said, &quot;but hold still.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tight wrap around his neck loosened, and that loosened the wrap around his face and the back of his head, and he felt a rush of steam, and then a warm wet towel went over as soon as the cloths were taken away and he still couldn&#39;t see anything. He&#39;d had brief glimpses of the twin masseurs, naked, but then Alex was scrubbing him clean.<br />
<br />
A moment later, he felt the table drop away and more hot wet cloth on his second chest and torso and then Hebe said, &quot;You&#39;re just delaying things.&quot;<br />
<br />
They came in on either side of him and whispered, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, this is going to be awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cloths came away.<br />
<br />
Derrick saw a mirror. In the mirror he saw the reflections of the twins, who were somehow dressed again in their spa uniforms, and between them, a very tall ... a man, but he stopped at the waist and there was a horse there, perfectly blended in where the V of the hips would have started. The man was built. He was bigger than the twins. His torso started around where the shoulder of the horse would have been and went up another five feet, and the horse part came up to their shoulders. Their faces were around where his navel would have been if he had one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah. I&#39;m huge,&quot; he said, because he realized that the centaur in the mirror had his face. Grown up, stronger, a bit edgier, and his hair had become something like a mohawk and he had horse ears, but it was his face.  The horse part was as excessively muscled as the human part, with feathers and a huge flowing tail. His &quot;mohawk&quot; was similarly flowing and ran down his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Hebe said, handing him a flask with a tightly screwed stopper. &quot;Drink this before you meet with your parents. You are currently at your optimal age. The flask will return you to fifteen, and you&#39;ll shrink by quite a bit, but it will come back in time naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Derrick said.  He looked at the brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Alex said, &quot;we go show you just how strong and fast you are.&quot;</p>
