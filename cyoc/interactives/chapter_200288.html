<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I pulled into the gas station and started fueling. Vague questions rose up but I pushed them aside saying it&#39;s better to top off than not. A faint feeling of, &quot;That&#39;s not the issue,&quot; was met with a, &quot;Well get back to me when you can clarify,&quot; and faded into the background as I went into the convenience store focusing mostly on the schoolwork I needed to accomplish in the next few hours.<br />
<br />
I approached the cappuccino machine which sputtered to life as I pressed the button, superheating some concoction within and mixing it with the water to create something sweet and caffeinated which was all I cared about. I gazed at the 20 oz cup disapprovingly with thoughts of algebraic equations, theorems, and proofs battling for attention... &quot;I&#39;m gonna need more...&quot; I said to myself and I made my way to the fridge and pulled a chilled Starbucks frappuccino from the cooler. <br />
<br />
I made my way to the counter and asked for two packs of cigarettes along with the coffees and paid with my credit card. Pocketing the frappuccino and a pack, I stepped outside and nimbly unwrapped the other to get my nicotine fix, it had been countless hours after all... I took several heavy drags and made my way back to my beater of a vehicle.<br />
<br />
I freed my car from the hose and got in, rolling the window down as soon as the car turned on, and continued my journey home. On the way, the stimulants were vying for dominance, a drag here, a gulp there. By the time I arrived home, I was prepared to focus on algebra 1b and the various other assignments.<br />
<br />
By 5:30 homework was finished, I popped outside for a couple of cigarettes and played a game on my phone to separate myself from the school day mentally. I had long ago finished the coffee and the tiny Starbucks frappuccino was just a couple of gulps to keep me from getting distracted mid homework. At 5:50 I went back inside and greeted my dad in passing, making my way back to my room, then to the bathroom for a shower. By 6:15, I was dressed and ready for the night out.<br />
<br />
I stopped by the store grabbing some beer and a handle before grabbing a small bite to eat through a drive-through. Just enough to make sure I&#39;m covered if snacks aren&#39;t very hearty. I stopped by the ATM and pulled out $50. I made my way across town and pulled into my buddy&#39;s house. I parked and brought the supplies into his garage, placing the beer in the fridge and the handle went into the freezer. It was a few minutes till 7, and I was the first one to arrive. I knocked on the door from the garage to the house and let myself in announcing my arrival.<br />
<br />
My friend&#39;s wife was cleaning up after dinner and gave a greeting as I entered. Within a few more minutes the gang arrived and quickly retired to the garage where snacks had accumulated and the beer fridge was now closer to full. The group of 7 other men ranged in ages between their 30s and late 50s. We sat around two folding tables pressed together which gave ample room for snacks, drinks, and ashtrays as we played poker, drank, and smoked. Of course, I pulled out my cigars and so did a few of the other refined folk at the table, it was the only thing that wasn&#39;t shared.<br />
<br />
Stories, chatter, thoughts, opinions... and money... passed around the table easily. Whenever someone got a straight or better, we would all break and take a shot which happened usually 1 to 3 times a night when everyone showed up. Snacks and beer helped the conversation flow and by 10 the party began to disband. <br />
<br />
I took a few minutes to help clean up and break down so the host wouldn&#39;t have it all to do themselves, got into my sports car, and drove home to my apartment. I got ready for bed brushing my teeth and changing out of my clothes, I briefly thought about classes tomorrow, thankful my first course starts at 10 and the college is near. Something about that didn&#39;t seem right but I let out a beer-flavored belch and decided to sleep on it...<br />
<br />
I woke up to my roommate making some noise in the kitchen and decided to get up. &quot;Mornin Jeff&quot; I offered desperately craving the liquid offerings the coffee pot sacrifices to my cause. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked up from his cereal and smiled, &quot;Ya have fun last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it!&quot; I said with a tiny bit of gusto and a smile as I reminisced. <br />
<br />
&quot;You win?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had a great time with the guys and have a tiny bit of cash left.&quot; I chuckled. &quot;So yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned and gave a weird look glancing at his computer and something like a toy gun he has plugged into it. &quot;Oh, you lost money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it all just goes in circles. I got 3 hours of entertainment and food for 30 bucks, a case of beer, and half a handle. Sure it&#39;s a little pricy but I didn&#39;t have to host, organize, or find a venue. It&#39;s not like this place would do.&quot; I made a grand gesture showcasing the small two-bedroom apartment.&quot;I&#39;ll probably come out ahead come Friday. Being on handle duty is the most expensive contribution role, I&#39;ve got cookies next, so that&#39;ll be 10 bucks instead of 30.&quot; Jeff is just a year younger than me at 18, but doesn&#39;t yet seem to realize the value of things beyond their initial price tag... poor kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t Tuesdays and Fridays weird nights for a regular poker game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but people got family they do stuff with on weekends, so out of weekdays, most people got Tuesday free and we can stay till 11 or 11:30 on Friday. It just works better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Jeff moved with his bowl of cereal to the computer desk setup he had in the living room. I&#39;m not sure why he didn&#39;t go with a laptop for college but it works for him... <br />
<br />
I finally got my coffee. I could have sworn I saw that thing on Jeff&#39;s desk flash but I realized I really wanted a cigar with my coffee and could ask Jeff what it is later. I had plenty of time before class and needed a shower from last night still anyway, so although I tend to save my cigars for the evening I grabbed one and took it to the balcony to enjoy.</p>
