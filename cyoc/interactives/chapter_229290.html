<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of that evening went relatively normal. The first thing he did was shower for more than an hour scrubbing off everybody else&#39;s taint.<br />
<br />
Then he got dressed and headed to class. He was late but the teacher said that it was okay since the towelboy needed time to shower. Everyone in the whole school knew. That first day, most everyone was still in a state of shock but few people teased Chad the new towelboy. A few people even reached down his pants and flipped the switch turning Chad into a towel but then they ran off leaving Chad in a pile of his own clothes until someone rescued him and helped him get dressed again.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the school day ended. His family didn&#39;t know yet so he just had a normal evening and went to bed. He tried thinking about what to do but he couldn&#39;t come up with anything.<br />
<br />
On the bus to school, he got turned into a towel again and the bus driver carried him and his clothes to his next class before switching him back to human. Students were entering the classroom as a naked Chad pulled his underwear back on.<br />
<br />
The principal made an announcement about new policies. He said that it was against the rules to turn Chad into a towel outside of gym class or without prior permission. Then he apologized to Chad because he knew that this new rule would be difficult to enforce and Chad would get turned into a towel anyway. So the principal also made a policy that anyone who found Chad as a towel when he wasn&#39;t supposed to be should help Chad immediately and anyone who helped Chad would be given a quarter. However, the principal warned that if it was discovered that people were conspiring to get quarters by turning Chad into a towel and then helping him would not only not get the corner but would be required to do some chore like mopping the floor as punishment.<br />
<br />
Chad thought about that and realized that people would have to be caught turning him into a towel and helping them and therefore, some would get away with turning him into a towel and helping him and getting a quarter for their scheme.<br />
<br />
The second day was similar to the first except that people were more relaxed about the idea that Chad was a towel and some of them got bolder in their teasing of him. One person even pulled Chad&#39;s pants down and showed everyone the ball stretcher before turning Chad into a towel.<br />
<br />
Of course, after P.E., Chad dried off all the other guys again before taking another shower.<br />
<br />
He got home to learn that his brother Brad had found out about him being a towelboy and Brad told his parents. His dad demanded a demonstration before he would believe and Brad insisted on stripping Chad naked for the demonstration. With Dad holding Chad by the part of the towel where the ball stretcher was attached, Dad became furious and promised to get this taken care of.<br />
<br />
Dad got on the phone and spoke angrily to one person after another while shaking Chad by the ball stretcher, not realizing that to Chad, it felt like he was being shaken by a firm hand around his balls. Even though Dad was furious, he kinda forgot he was holding his son and acted like he was just holding an ordinary towel. Chad was even left to sleep on the floor as a forgotten towel while his family went to bed.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Brad discovered the towel still on the floor and flipped the switch. But naked, human Chad was still asleep. Dad had already left for work and mom went back to bed so while Brad fixed his own breakfast and got ready for school, he kept stopping to study Chad&#39;s ball stretcher. Brad even held Chad&#39;s balls to see how heavy they felt.<br />
<br />
Chad was so exhausted, he slept through most of it but he did finally wake up to find Brad holding his entire cock and balls and feeling them.<br />
<br />
Chad asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad said, &quot;Sorry but you don&#39;t have time to get dressed. We&#39;ve got to catch the bus now or we&#39;ll be late for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad then turned Chad into a towel, gathered his clothes and supplies into a duffle bag, and caught the bus to school. Once at school, Brad went to Chad&#39;s class before making Chad human again. Brad didn&#39;t just let Chad get dressed. Brad helped Chad get dressed by holding Chad&#39;s underwear, pulling them up Chad&#39;s legs and tucking Chad&#39;s cock in.<br />
<br />
Over time, Chad slowly became used to his new life. Dad tried and tried but eventually gave up in futility. So did Chad and everyone else who cared about him. Chad&#39;s treatment by other students became slowly worse. Even those who cared about him started treating him more like a towel than a human.<br />
<br />
The school had been very strict about Chad&#39;s usage at first. They allowed the boys in P.E. to use Chad because they knew they couldn&#39;t oppose Rick. Rick wasn&#39;t completely out of control because Rick had the ambition of becoming a famous athlete. Therefore, as long as people stayed out of Rick&#39;s way, Rick didn&#39;t do anything bad to them. But as time passed, the strict prevention of people besides Rick using Chad relaxed. Then even school staff started using Chad. Science teacher needs to clean up a mess? Grab Chad. Lunch staff needs to clean up a mess? Grab Chad. Chad even began regularly reporting to the janitor for towel duty.<br />
<br />
He never enjoyed it but he went along with it more and more. He found ways to enjoy life anyway. He still went to the beach with his friends. They swam and played and then Chad dried them off after. They all got used to the idea that as long as Chad went with them, none of them ever needed to bring a towel.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s family also started using him as a towel though never as much as everyone else did. Neither his mom or dad ever used him to dry off after a shower. They decided that it was just too inappropriate for parents to get that intimate with their son. But Brad overcame the taboo and started drying off with Chad after every shower. It got to the point where habitually, every morning, both boys would strip and shower together. They got used to each other&#39;s nudity and they got comfortable helping each other get clean. It wasn&#39;t exactly sexual but if either of them got a boner, they&#39;d help each other out.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s sexuality changed a little. He was still completely straight as a man but as a towel, he began to prefer men. Women usually wrapped Chad around their hair where he stayed for a while, bored. Men rubbed his face in their cock and then they were finished and Chad could move on to the next guy. Everyone got used to this, including Rick. They all treated him like a straight dude, not a gay dude. But all the guys felt free to touch or grab Chad even when he was human.<br />
<br />
There was one time when the team was traveling to compete in a distant city. They decided to give Chad a free ride on the team bus if he would stay over in the team&#39;s hotel rooms. But they worried that Chad might get lost so while Chad was a towel one day, someone grabbed a permanent marker, the kind that doesn&#39;t wash off of cloth in the laundry. He wrote, &quot;Property of the Tiger Boys&quot;. When Chad woke up, he found the words, &quot;Property of the Tiger Boys&quot; tattooed on his forehead.<br />
<br />
That same night, Danny became worried that he had a sore on his testicles but he couldn&#39;t see it to examine it. Absolutely everyone refused to look at the sore. Danny didn&#39;t even ask Chad. Danny just put his balls in Chad&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;I can&#39;t see it this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any discussion, two guys grabbed Chad and laid him on the bed with his head hanging off the end so he could get a better look.<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;I still can&#39;t find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again without a word, Danny grabbed Chad&#39;s hand and wrapped it around his own balls. &quot;It&#39;s right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad could feel it then but couldn&#39;t see it. He examined it with his hands for a while before announcing, &quot;I have no idea what that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone went back to the usual stuff as if nothing strange had just happened. Danny&#39;s sore turned out to be nothing but an ingrown hair. That night, Lucas went to bed with Chad wrapped around his waste. He woke up to discover Chad between his legs right up against Lucas&#39; perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus and between the legs.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Chad graduated and headed off to college. Chad hoped to escape some of the towelboy nonsense. He couldn&#39;t escape all of it because his brother expected a shower every time Chad or Brad visited each other but Chad moved to a college far away and no longer had any contact with Rick or most of the people he knew in high school. He still got together with old friends from time to time but he made a bunch of new friends that didn&#39;t know anything about him being a towelboy.<br />
<br />
Chad shared a small apartment with three other guys. Noah was his roommate. Chad became very modest never letting any of them see him without a hat to cover the tattoo and shorts to cover the ball stretcher that would never go away. Everyone wondered why Chad was so modest. The most popular theory was that Chad was bald and had a tiny dick. Chad didn&#39;t bother discouraging these theories.</p>
