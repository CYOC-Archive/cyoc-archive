<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pris found herself smiling as she set the phone down and seeing that her message to Liam. She figured he would like the picture and would be supportive, and a part of her mind even happily mused that it might provoke the next stage in their relationship. They&#39;d been friends for years, and he also seemed to be the most understanding with regard her having an active T-Gene and had been there for her as she essentially revealed her certainty in what she was becoming. And in many ways she was very aware of that.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jeremy&#39;s periodic lectures on T-Girls and T-Guys were often portrayed as something that Mr. Jeremy liked to pretend were informative on a subject with which no one else knew. However, that wasn&#39;t the case. The news had been reporting on the existence of the T-Gene and what happened when it activated ever since the first T-Girls appeared. Of course one could argue on the opinion of the reporting, but that didn&#39;t really change the facts that they reported. And when they first began to appear, it was first thought to be a virus of some kind that was triggering the mutation of young women into massive Amazons that often seemed to be far more confident and forward after their transformation completed. The result had been the camps run by the Health Department that often looked more like private spa retreats than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pris?&quot; an adult female voice called through her bedroom door, &quot;I trust your homework is done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom,&quot; Pris answered catching herself her thoughts were stopped for a moment.<br />
<br />
Her parents weren&#39;t necessarily bad people, but they weren&#39;t exactly the type that had supported T-People. Her father was a retired Army officer and presently worked for the city as a contract &quot;hunter&quot; to kill off the various Animals that had active T-Genes under the expectation they were a threat to people and would only spread the condition to people. Her mother was rather reserved and personally rather conservative and wasn&#39;t very supportive on T-People, largely for the fact that T-Girls were not also taller and stronger than most normal men but that they also often seemed to be far more forward with regard to what they liked and who they liked, which didn&#39;t fit with how she saw the world.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d initially been worried on how they would respond to finding out that she was becoming a T-Girl, herself, on that basis. She&#39;d even voiced that nervousness to Liam that they might throw her out because of how they felt about T-People in general. But Liam had been supportive of her and that struck the part of her mind that wanted their relationship to grow from just friends to boyfriend and girlfriend.  But for the moment, while Pris could tell she was growing more and more confident, especially in recognizing that she&#39;d just sent a picture of herself in an athletic shirt and black bicycle shorts that did little to hide her growing muscles, hips, butt, and bust to the boy she secretly loved, with the full knowledge that if he was hanging out with Tommy, Tommy would surely see the picture too, she wasn&#39;t quite to the point where she&#39;d say openly, even to Liam, that she wanted their relationship to be more than just friends... Not yet, anyway.<br />
<br />
Her mother didn&#39;t go away though, as Pris soon heard her call through the doorway again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, now dinner is ready, move it or lose it,&quot; her mother called through the door.<br />
<br />
It was at that point where Pris softly heard footsteps walking away. She quietly thought for a moment on the situation she had in dealing with her parents. She could try to hide the changes in her body out of fear, as she&#39;d been doing ever since she started having the repeated headaches and cramps that were often associated with the activation of the T-Gene. However a part of her mind snapped at that. She wasn&#39;t sick. Being a T-Girl wasn&#39;t a disease, and was the result of having an active T-Gene, and one she&#39;d been born with according the more recent news reports. That meant she was born with an active T-Gene. What caused it to activate might still be a mystery, but that didn&#39;t change that it was natural and it was active with her. There was nothing she could have done to not become a T-Girl.<br />
<br />
With that, Pris strode far more confidently than she&#39;d been earlier to the doorway and opened the door. She eventually made her way through her home and found her parents sitting down to the dinner table, and a plate of food waiting for her. For the moment there was a silence as she came into the dinning room and slid her chair back. Eventually something was said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you wearing?&quot; her father demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;This?&quot; Pris answered, &quot;Just something new I picked out at the mall today with Liam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You let that boy pick out clothes for you?&quot; her mother gasped, &quot;you know the only thing on his mind is getting into your pants!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... Liam is a bit dense at times,&quot; Pris thought silently with a frown. She&#39;d begun to have some more romantic feelings even before her transition into becoming a T-Girl began, and she&#39;d periodically dropped hints that those feelings were there. Saying that he&#39;d never be a midget to her was one of those hints, but Liam never seemed to fully pick up on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;With as tight as those shorts are, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d need any imagination,&quot; her father spoke, disapproval clear in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re bicycle shorts, dad, people wear them to get exercise,&quot; Pris answered as she began eating, privately thankful that dinner was ready, &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to wear them to school or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was true. The trip to the mall to get some things that would fit her ended up getting a fairly wide variety of things. Some things would serve to cover herself a bit more, in case it got cold, though there were a few things that would also serve the purpose of essentially showing off her growth. And in the back of her mind, the idea to send Liam the selfie she&#39;d taken was pleased with that, though she did recognize the that there was a time and place for everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point, you bring that boy here enough as it is,&quot; her mother commented, &quot;Should he see you in that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll what? Get the uncontrollable urge to join the Tour De France?&quot; Pris answered, &quot;Liam is a good guy. He&#39;s been kind and considerate. The very thing I thought you&#39;d WANT me to look for in a guy?&quot; She didn&#39;t add out loud however, that it was Tommy they needed to be wary of, especially with the fact that she was becoming a T-Girl, even if she was only in the early stages of the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not an excuse to flaunt yourself,&quot; her mother answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn&#39;t here!&quot; Pris argued, &quot;It&#39;s not like he can see me right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Things fell silent for a moment. Pris took that moment to stab her fork into the meat on her plate. She was certain her parents disapproved, but at the moment she really didn&#39;t care. She was clearly stronger than she was before and she&#39;d found herself becoming far more confident in herself as she developed. In this, Pris knew that she was also far more confident than she was even earlier that afternoon. It could be that as some of her physical changes accelerated, her mental changes accelerated with them. <br />
<br />
In this, she really didn&#39;t care if her parents disapproved. They&#39;d just have to get used to her being a T-Girl, or lose her all together, and while they might &quot;boot her out&quot; she was fairly sure that Liam&#39;s family would let her stay with them and with the latest news reports that found and proved that the T-Gene wasn&#39;t a disease. And since T-People didn&#39;t turn into mindless monsters, they couldn&#39;t kill her and get away with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s an excuse?&quot; her mother asked, &quot;a proper lady does not flaunt herself or her body and makes sure her suiter is a gentleman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not running around in tight clothing like a T-Girl slut looking for a T-Guy to pound her,&quot; her father answered, &quot;The damn liberals may have given them rights, but they&#39;re still practically animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not looking to get pounded by anyone,&quot; Pris answered as she clinched her hands around her knife and fork, &quot;and you&#39;d better rethink the &quot;they&#39;re animals idea.&quot; Think HARD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; her father&#39;s eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you didn&#39;t notice,&quot; Pris answered with irritation in her voice and narrowed eyes of her own, &quot;I AM a T-Girl... or at least transforming into one. I can feel it... all my muscles are getting bigger. I feel far more fit than I ever have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably just got bit by one of the T-Animals,&quot; her father said with a dismissive wave of his hand, &quot;we&#39;ll take you to the doctor and get some antibiotics and that&#39;ll fix you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never been bitten by a T-Animal,&quot; Pris answered, &quot;and in case you&#39;ve forgotten, T-People aren&#39;t sick. They don&#39;t have a disease. The same goes for T-Animals. It&#39;s just that they have an active T-Gene and that EVERYONE on Earth has a T-Gene. It&#39;s just a question on whether or not its active. In my case... the gene is active, but I got it from you and mom. So... if T-People are animals... what are you? As you have the gene too, just not an active one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her father glared at her for a moment, but Pris glared back. She wasn&#39;t going to just let her parents walk over her anymore. She might not have asked to become a T-Girl, but it was happening regardless. And in a way it felt good to get all of that off her chest, particularly as her parents then backed down. That felt good, and in the back of her mind floated the reminder, &quot;and now to win Liam&#39;s love.&quot;</p>
