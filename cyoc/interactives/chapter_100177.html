<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jenny slept, Greg, her only remaining parent, he thought back to when Jenny&#39;s mother had died. In all actuality neither of the women who had been Jenny&#39;s mothers had died, but due to &quot;Aware&quot; being off, and Jenny&#39;s great-grandmother being dead and unable to be resurrected and rejuvenated to fill the role, Greg now had some vague blurry memory of his wife--whom he couldn&#39;t quite remember anymore, having died. Her death had left him to be the sole parent for Jenny. He&#39;d always felt that because of that he&#39;d failed Jenny in some way that a mother wouldn&#39;t have. Certainly if her mother was here, she might have taught Jenny to be more careful and she might not be pregnant with twins before finishing High School. Jenny had just told him, and he&#39;d reacted... badly. He&#39;d yelled at her, asking if she knew what she was doing with her life. He now just felt truly guilty and he wished he knew how to fix things or approach her. Maybe the internet might have a solution.<br />
<br />
The computer, which had originally been in Jenny&#39;s room had now, thanks to the change in the family dynamics and loss of a second income had been brought out into the living room as the shared family computer. Greg sat down at it, and wiggled the mouse to wake the screen from the screensaver.<br />
<br />
What appeared was a program which looked like that Sims game he&#39;d seen advertised occasionally on TV. Jenny must have bought the game and left it running before going to bed. Curiosity getting the better of him, Greg took at look at the characters and house. The house looked rather like their own and there was a Father and Daughter character each. Underneath the daughter character were listed two names that seemed oddly familiar to Greg but he could place his finger on why: Kelly and Anna. Deciding to leave the sleeping daughter character alone, Greg clicked on the Father character, which brought up a spinning naked model which look rather like him--even down to his penis size when erect--how had Jenny discovered that? He didn&#39;t want to know--especially considering the one time Greg remembered walking in on his mother, Crystal when she was in the shower. At the time he&#39;d been a little boy and didn&#39;t know any better what his mommy was doing so long in the shower. With adult eyes he blushed to remember that memory that had caused him to be rather shy and embarrassed around girls for a while after that. Hopefully it was just something innocent like that.<br />
<br />
What drew his attention was the age option on the program. Curious, Greg decided to see what his character looked like at a different age. So he began hitting the minus button one year at a time. At first very few changes were noticeable to Greg as he left his early forties and re-entered his thirties. Some of his muscles began to look a little firmer on the model, with the tiny bit of a gut he&#39;d acquired from too much beer and potato chips watching football games melting away. The grey around his temples and ears began to darken, and a few lines on his face began to smooth over. Emboldened and liking what he saw, Greg decided to go further--back to his college days when he&#39;d been an athlete and won the heart of Jenny&#39;s mother. He began hitting the minus button quicker and more rapidly, without paying attention to the numbers as they began flying by. He watched as the model became even trimmer, and his muscles firmed up into a lean athletic build he&#39;d worked to achieve so much. As soon as he saw it, he stopped clicking and admired his body. His little sister, Jenny, had annoyed him all through high school about his not wanting to spend time with her, but the end results were worth it. But the model didn&#39;t stop regressing, the muscles thinning out and Greg being thinning out until he was as thin as a telephone pole. He must have clicked the minus button too much and the model was taking time to catch up with the number of clicks. Fascinated, Greg watched as the model began to shrink suddenly as if in spurts. He felt odd in his seat as he watched and had to skooch around to get comfortable, but Greg watched as the lanky teen went through puberty in reverse and began looking more like a little boy than a man as his face became more rounded and his hands and feet began to shrink as well to match his height. Kicking his feet against the chair he was sitting in, Greg watched as the little boy on the computer began to get even younger and younger, with baby fat filling up on his legs and arms and tummy. When the boy on the screen was finished growing down, a cute boy of three stood there where before there&#39;d been... there&#39;d been. For some reason Greg couldn&#39;t remember what had been there before as the Aware button was off. Bored, and rather tired, Greg decided it was time to find mommy. The toddler slid off the chair he&#39;d been sitting in and wobbled his way down the hall. Unbeknownst to Greg an error message had popped up on the computer screen, but he was too busy fumbling with his mommy&#39;s door to hear or notice the beeping computer with a timer counting down the few minutes until it would be too late to correct. <br />
<br />
Greg opened the door to his mommy&#39;s room. The light hit Jenny and her face scrunched up all weird-like before she opened her eyes and groaned, &quot;What is it Greggy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna sleep with you Mommy,&quot; said Greg insistantly.<br />
<br />
Tiredly, Jenny nodded her head in agreement and told him to close the door behind him--which he did. Greg then waddled over to his mommy&#39;s bed, where she backed up so he could climb up and sleep right in her embrace like a big spoon cradling a little spoon. This was the best way to sleep, Greg thought as he snuggled up with his Mommy. He felt so safe and secure with Mommy&#39;s arms about him.<br />
<br />
As Greg and Jenny fell back to sleep, the computer&#39;s timer ran down and then began to correct the error. Like Anna before, Jenny couldn&#39;t be sixteen and have a three year old child considering she&#39;d been too underdeveloped to have had a kid at thirteen and survive. So the error went to work fixing the problem. Greg, like Anna before him, began to grow younger in Jenny&#39;s arms, his hair thinning out, baby fat taking over more of his body. Uncomfortable, Greg turned around in his mommy&#39;s arms, planting his face plainly into his mother&#39;s breasts. As Greg continued to get younger by the months, Jenny&#39;s breasts began to swell along with her womb as a placenta and umbilical cord grew, preparing to welcome Greg into his new Mommy. In the meanwhile Greg&#39;s infantile instincts took over as he began to nuzzle at Jenny&#39;s milk swollen breasts, wishing to suckle as the months brought him out of toddlerhood and into infancy. Half-asleep, and feeling her breasts constrained by her nightie, Jenny took slipped out of her nightie and brought Greg closer into her embrace. Satisfied Greg began to suckle, and Jenny felt warm and comfortable as Greg fed from her. The feelings reverberated and pulsed through her, easing the pain of her rapidly growing womb and the umbilical chord that began slithering down the birth canal and out of her stretching cervix.<br />
<br />
As Greg sucked the milk from his Mommy his thoughts grew increasingly simple as shapes and colors began to grow fuzzy in the dim dark light. As his age came down from months to days, the umbilical chord from Jenny&#39;s vagina slithered up her rounding belly and reached for Greg&#39;s belly button. In an instant he was sucking and the next he felt the need to do so vanish. Greg closed his blurry eyes for the final time and let a feeling of content overwhelm him as he was pulled closer and closer to his mommy. Soon he felt his feet feel warm and wet, then his legs, and then his tummy, then his arms, and at last his head. He was being pulled up and up, deeper into his Mommy. His mommy...<br />
<br />
Jenny, once again felt the discomfort of a bulging nine month belly as Greg pressed his little feet against her sides and popped her own belly button out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gotta be a boy, he&#39;s kicking me far too hard,&quot; sighed Jenny as she rubbed her belly, but then felt the need to pee. As she pushed to sit up and stand, taking a few moments and the help of her nightstand in order to get up on her feet. As she did, her belly shrank by a month, making it easier for her to waddle to her door. As she hurried down the hall to the bathroom, she lost yet another month and felt the need to pee really climax. As she left her third trimester she just managed to make it to the toilet  and she relieved her bladder. Relieved at sitting down, Jenny laid back, relieving the pressure on her back as her breasts shrank as milk production shriveled up and she continued urinating out the fluids that came from the reduction of her breasts and the shrinking of her womb. The months continued to shed off of her as Greg continued to undevelop. As she approached the border between her second trimester and her first, Greg undeveloped to the point where he could no longer think, and Jenny felt her belly melt down to nearly a manageable level. Jenny was beginning to feel rather horny with all her hormones riled up, and she planned on texting Tim to come over. After all, why had she gone to bed so early? It was only nine-thirty and not a school night. She should be out having fun. Jenny got up and looked at herself in the mirror, she had a rather flabby stomach, but she was working on getting rid of that. What had her worried was that her period was a little late--but she&#39;d been late before. As the first month of her pregnancy began to turn into days, Jenny rushed over to her phone to text for Tim to hurry over. Her grandmother, Crystal, who she had been raised by after the death of her parents when she was rather young, was off at a dog show for the weekend, judging as she had for many weekends of Jenny&#39;s childhood.<br />
<br />
As days turned into hours, the cluster of cells that made up Greg began to consolidate and simplify, until he was back to being a fertilized egg, a state at which he was joining Kathy and Anna at, as they awaited the return of Tim to continue.<br />
<br />
Finally Jenny got a message that Tim was just outside. She eagerly hugged him as he came in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, with my Grandma at the dog show you could stay over,&quot; she assured him. Tonight she wanted to try <br />
<br />
&quot;Your grandmother? What... what happened to your parents?&quot; asked Tim, who since the Aware option for him was still on, was clearly left in the dark as to all the changes that had happened while away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you trying to kill my mood, Tim?&quot; asked Jenny, rather upset at being reminded of her parent&#39;s death. She wasn&#39;t sad, but talking about it was a poor move on his part.</p>
