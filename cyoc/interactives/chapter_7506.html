<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ignoring Miss Salmanella you look at Billy and walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salmanella, Salmanella, how could some mother name her daughter...?&quot;<br />
You say out loud as Billy trots along side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, no,no, dear friend, the word doesn't have the same meaning here as it did back in our world. She own's part of Queen Mayella's name and therefore she is respected for being so named, or at least she was respected. The Queen sent her here to bargin with John of Merlin. He owns three books of magic left to him by the Great Merlin. It so happens that Sarah's book is also part of the collection. Merlin, when he was about to die sent the books far and wide. He knew the future and that some person like Queen Mayella would plan and scheme to rule the world by using, magic.&quot; tells Billy as you hang on every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did John change Salmanella into this goat there?&quot; you say as pointing toward where she was only to be bumped from the left by her pretty muzzel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, she never got to John with her message. Instead, John wasn't at home when she came and while she wandered around, she met those two horney sisters who wanted to kiss you, remember? Well, she played with them and in no time was lured over the fence and into a frolicking game. I was busy with my work, yuck, yuck, yuck, and heard the anguished screams of a human female beyond the hill. I reached the top of the hill only to see a woman ripping off her clothing and screaming as she did. The two nannies took turns licking her rapidly changing human pussy till the fur began to sprout. Once the fur sprouts, the person in not going to be human for too long! Anyway I approached only to have her beg for sexual pleasures, well I'm not one to say no to a party, natually I joined in.&quot; tells Billy as now his red shaft is out and stiff as hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mounted her?&quot; you ask knowing the answer to come.<br />
<br />
Bily cocks his head and looks up at you as if you just asked a stupid question. &quot;Well then why is Salmanella so bad then?&quot; you ask a resonable question.<br />
<br />
Billy jumps up to stand with his forelegs hung over your shoulders. His stiff shaft you brush to one side as it pokes into your belly. Billy giggles at the touch of you touching his shaft, but you continue to think of the question at hand.<br />
<br />
In a whisper Billy says, &quot;Listen dear friend, she is a whores' whore! In the Queen's court or out here she has on object in life and that's to make men lust for her body. Oh, of course now she can't lure men so well, but she drives the few other males around here so crazy they can't leave her alone. Well, I for one can and do, she's, contagious!&quot;<br />
<br />
You walk a little fast as Billy drops back to all fours. &quot;I can't understand you, this animal to which you have been changed, you accept it so well!&quot; a statement made for a response.<br />
<br />
Billy chuckles and then gives you some truth, &quot;Yup, I do! I was a brat teen and looking for trouble! In our world I would have been a problem for the law and my parents. Yet once I landed here this world drew me into what was, I admit at first just plain terrifying. It took me two, maybe three days till the realism of this goat body made new sense to me. I, for once had a purpose in life! A simple purpose, but a real purpose! Not like in humanity does a person have a life which makes things better for some, you struggle, like my Dad. He has a hell of a bad time with people at work, his boss, everybody is clawing at him to get what he's got or just push him out of the way. I, I don't have his problem! Now I can eat, sleep, and fuck with hundreds of sweet welcoming pussies. Yea, I think of them by what I see the most of, pussies!&quot;<br />
<br />
You think for a minute as a pair of hairy lips nicker with the finger on your left hand. Looking down you quickly pull you hand up as Salmanella is playing with you.<br />
<br />
Billy laughs loudly, as Salmanella steps away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't miss your family?&quot; you ask softly.<br />
<br />
Billy whips his head back to look up at you. &quot;Miss, miss what, getting kicked for wanting to be something other than a working grunt in some mill, no thanks! I'm King here, I have all my need met, and here is where I stay. A truth to be sure that learning to graze as this goat self wasn't easy. I never liked spinach, or green beans, yet once I lowered my head and foretook the blades of grass, I choked! Yup, choked, the grazing came slowly and as I tried again and again knowing that there wasn't going to be MacDonalds, freedum fries,<br />
and milk shakes anymore. Now I spend a few quick hours per day grazing to keep my strength for when the nannies wander near.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at Billy you are walking slowly but suddenly a chuckhole captures the end of your boot. Falling forward you mind screams as the terror of Salmanella's royal butt is directly before you. A second of time which to this day seems like a minute of horrid fear. Indeed your forward fall is broken by Salmanella's rump, you face is targeted for a direct hit on her hairy flat rump. A short chuckle from Billy is the last thing you hear before your own screams begin.<br />
<br />
Smack, you face hits her solid nanny rear. As if by her desire she spreads her legs opening the leathered lips of her nanny sex. A human forehead rams into her pelvic bones but you human nose pokes into the juiced lips of goaty sex. Only a second it was as your head jerked back and you took a quick breath.<br />
<br />
Those curse juices now covered you nose. Even as you drew that last breath you nose had not backed past her glorious lips of goaty sex. The sniff drew in her scent, air, and her juices as well. A normal and quick response was a damning one. Your hand comes up in a quick move and begins to rub and smeer the juices over your face. Billy's laughing stops up short as he screams, &quot;NO, Buddy, NO!&quot; too late.</p>
