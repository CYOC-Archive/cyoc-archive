<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a shaping up to be a very lonely Halloween.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy was flopped on the living room couch watching the &quot;reimagined&quot; version of <br />
Nightmare on Elm Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;His costume lay in a pile on the floor as Alberto had gotten a stomach flu and Alberto's girlfriend, April, <br />
would not go trick-or-treating alone with Jeremy and leave Alberto alone sick in bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;His parents had left for their own Halloween <br />
party dressed as Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe, and he was left with Netflix.<br />
<br />
His phone vibrated in his pocket with a text.&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped it open and saw a text from Neil, the kid who sometimes sat at his lunch <br />
table: &quot;Trick-or-treat mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil's father worked for a British airline, and Neil had been raised in London, Cape Town, Cairo, Bangkok&nbsp;and Sydney.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil's mother, <br />
an American, had enough of seeing the world and had brought Neil to the states while his father finished out the last three years of <br />
his tenure and his sister went off to Cambridge for university studies.<br />
<br />
Neil was, frankly, awkward.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd started at Jeremy's school in September and he had ended up sitting at Jeremy's lunch table only <br />
because none of Jeremy's friends had 5th period lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil's accent was a mix of his childhood British and Australian from the last 3 <br />
years of living in Sydney.&nbsp;&nbsp;He always kept prattling on about all the things he'd seen around the world and Jeremy, having been raised <br />
to be polite, listened with half a heart and a facade of full attention.<br />
<br />
Neil didn't talk about girls, sports, video games, anime, manga or even cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil could care less which girl walked by the table or <br />
which game Jeremy had just gotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about exploring these different cities, finding ruins of old buildings and reading books <br />
you'd never find on Amazon.com that he bought from little stalls in open air markets in foreign countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn't a bad guy, <br />
Jeremy always mused, just&nbsp;&quot;different&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy texted back: &quot;Where r u? TorT ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reply came back quickly: &quot;My house- in basement- come in when u get here&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy sighed, picked up his Iron Man costume and shrugged it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking 6 blocks, crossing the main drag and then another 2 <br />
blocks brought him to Neil's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;The driveway was empty, and the suburban cookie-cutter house, that was not at all unlike <br />
Jeremy's, was dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy walked up to the unadorned front door and opened it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the layout, he silently made his way <br />
through a living room filled with antique furniture, dark tapestries and some strange carved masks hanging on the walls to the back <br />
hall where the stairs to the basement were.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and the dim light of an unfinished basement lit by bare bulbs greeted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw right, then, mate!&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a might hasty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't expecting you for at least another ten!&nbsp;&nbsp;C'mon down, I'm getting ready to <br />
change for the night out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy made his way down the wood stairs carefully, remembering how shallow the steps were in his house and realizing these were <br />
built the same cheap way.<br />
<br />
The back half of the basement by the furnace and hot water heater was dark as the bulb there was not working.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil stood in the <br />
dark portion, wearing what Jeremy could only interpret as some kind of Asian robe that was red with white characters sewn into <br />
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet were bare, which made Jeremy wonder if he was naked under the robe.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of him was a plastic bin with a lid on <br />
it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a winner of a costume for this year's festivities, Jer.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be the first to see it! I bought it in Thailand a few years ago and have <br />
been studying how it works for a few years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy gave him a doubtful look, &quot;Doesn't look like anyone I've seen before, unless it's a white guy who just got it on with a geisha <br />
and then borrowed her robe to go out and get the morning paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil laughed for the first time since Jeremy had known him, &quot;Oh, mate, that's priceless.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see what you're saying, I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, see, I <br />
knew you were the smart one in the bunch, I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I always talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy did not feel any more reassured by Neil's laughter, &quot;So, let's get this show on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you going to be?&nbsp;&nbsp;What's left <br />
to get you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil smiled in what was more of a grin, &quot;Oh, you're just in time for the final step. I already read the incantations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Incantations?&nbsp;&nbsp;Dude, are you a witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mate, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something I picked up from a dark market in Bangkok.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to go as a Thai deity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, you think anyone'll get that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mate, there will be no doubts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil reached in the bin, which caused some splashing sounds and then started to drag out some odd clingy, stringy material that <br />
looked like randomly woven netting.&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw it over, covering himself in the material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Veins of a deity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulled from tombs in Thailand, they say, the body was preserved by some weird embalming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been <br />
rehydrating them for months down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are real veins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, and if I did this right, this next step'll do it.&quot; Something silver flashed and Jeremy realized that Neil had a knife in his hand and <br />
that he had cut one wrist and then the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimacing, Neil took different ends of the veiny mess and stuck them into his bloody <br />
wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy took step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any second now,&quot; Neil said with a pained look, &quot;any second now&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy could see the web of veins start to pulse as if they were in synch with Neil's heart. He wanted to be sick, he <br />
wanted to be anywhere else but here, but Neil's growing smile of seeming glee made Jeremy stand and watch in wonderment.<br />
<br />
When the veins starting eating through Neil's flesh, leaving a bloody web of red lines all over his skin, Jeremy turned and bolted for <br />
the stairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgot about how short the risers were, miscalculated and his foot caught the next riser. Jeremy went face down on the <br />
steps and slid back down to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had almost managed to catch himself, but had banged his nose a little bit and he sat <br />
holding it. He could see Neil and the dark half of the room through the spaces between the open-back stair risers.<br />
<br />
Neil was hunched forward on this hands and knees now, grunting like he was being twisted and his voice started to squeak from the <br />
pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy could see Neil's sandy hair turn dark and begin to grow longer and cover his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that was visible of Neil now <br />
was his hair and his arms, which seemed to tint darker a bit and get thinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tight robe hung looser, it seemed, and Neil's <br />
twisting cries were higher in pitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the cries ended in a &quot;Yessss...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt blood trickling down his face from his nose and watched as Neil floated upright back onto his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped breathing <br />
for a second when Neil's new long hair parted and Jeremy saw the face of most beautiful Asian woman imaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then he <br />
realized the red robe was looser, but the shape within more feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremiah.&quot; Her voice was soothing and sultry, yet light and pure.&nbsp;&nbsp;As she spoke, Jeremy felt the trickle of blood from his nose <br />
stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled himself up and walked around the stairs to get a better look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are named for the prophet who was sent to warn those who worshiped false idols, and so you shall fulfill that destiny again.&nbsp;&nbsp;You <br />
shall be my prophet on this night of my return to mortality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. uh..&quot; Jeremy was captivated by her almond eyes, &quot;who...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tap Tun, your goddess, Jeremiah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the energy within men.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am their lust, their passion and,&quot; she cocked her head slightly to <br />
one side, &quot;their impotence if I so choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have flesh again, we begin to return the earth to its true balance between <br />
women and men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fixated by her exotic features, by her eyes that seemed to hold something greater, Jeremy began to feel a burden lifted from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <br />
life of devotion and prophecy would be far better than just killing people and stealing cars in Grand Theft Auto and fantasizing at <br />
night about what it would be like to have Selena Gomez cuddled up in bed with him.<br />
<br />
Tap Tun smiled at him, &quot;Release yourself to me, Jeremiah,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her arms out, he went to her and let himself be enfolded in <br />
her embrace. &quot;You shall be my right hand and live a life where you will be envied by all men who have felt my power.&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose you <br />
because you had a spark, and so you shall be my guiding light out in this night of this strange new land.&nbsp;&nbsp;And on this night where your <br />
people open their doors to strangers, we shall go and spread the news of my rebirth.<br />
<br />
His head buried in her robe, Jeremiah the prophet could only muster one answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my Goddess, yes.&quot;</p>
