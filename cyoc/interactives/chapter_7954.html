<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">jen had barely been in her first period class (Biology) for ten minutes when an office aide came into the room, handing her teacher a slip of paper.Mr. Jerichosta, her teacher, read the slip, and then summoned her up to the desk. <br />
<br />
              Handing her the slip, he shook his head, &quot;I doubt you'll be head cheerleader much longer, Jennifer, after what you pulled yesterday. Miss Jorgenson wants to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
              A knot rose in Jen's stomach as she headed for Miss Jorgenson's office. Miss Jorgenson was the girls' gym teacher as well as being the head of the cheerleading team. This couldn't be a good thing, Jen knew. There was only one reason she'd get called down there so soon; it was so she could be dismissed from the team without any of the other girls seeing her, to save her some embarassment. <br />
<br />
               Jen's mind quickly worked to see how this could be turned to her advantage. She knew Miss Jorgenson didn't have a class scheduled until third period, so she would be alone. Miss Jorgenson also had her own office in the girls' lockerroom, so they'd have a great deal of privacy. Now would be as good a time as any to test her new powers.<br />
<br />
              Jen slipped into the girls' bathroom, hiding in a stall, quickly hiking up the long black dress she'd chosen to wear, and pulling off her panties. Wadding them up, she put them into her purse and smoothed her dress out, heading down to her teacher's office. Knocking on the door, she was answered by a crisp and firm, &quot;Come in, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
             Jen opened the office door and took a seat across from Miss Jorgenson's desk. Miss Jorgenson (Heidi to her friends) had been a star cheerleader during her days as a student. Trophies from various cheer competitions lined her shelves, and various plaques decorated the walls.  She was a lanky woman with small breasts, standing roughly six feet tall, almost an amazon in the world of cheerleading. She had deeply tanned skin and long, sun bleached hair that trailed almost all the way down her back. Now 28, she had returned to her alma mater as an instructor. She was staring at Jen with a decidedly displeased look in her eyes, which were an icy shade of blue.<br />
<br />
              &quot;Jennifer...I don't really know where to begin..&quot; she said, obviously upset. &quot;You're a cheerleader; you're the head cheerleader, and you acted like a fool yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
              &quot;I know,&quot; Jen replied, trying her best to look contrite. She hiked the edge of her dress up slightly, hoping that it would facilitate the spread of her pheremones into the air.<br />
<br />
              &quot;I can't believe what I saw yesterday. You're held to a higher standard, you know.&quot; Jen saw Miss Jorgenson's nostrils flare slightly. She had caught the scent, even if she didn't realize it yet.<br />
<br />
               &quot;I know,&quot; Jen told her, consciously trying to produce more of the pheremones.<br />
<br />
              &quot;And now...with what's happened to Kyle..I...I...&quot; Miss Jorgenson trailed off momentarily. There was no doubt she'd caught the scent and was trying to fight off its effects. Jen tested the theory by getting up from her seat and closing the blinds on the window. Miss Jorgenson weakly protested, &quot;What are you doing, Jen? Jen..listen to me, I have to kick you off the squad. Cindy..Cindy's..&quot;<br />
<br />
              &quot;Cindy's what, Miss J?&quot; Jen asked, a coy smile on her face. She peeled off her dress and unhooked her bra, turning and locking the door.<br />
<br />
              &quot;Jennifer...I....Jennifer..don't..&quot; the teacher said, shaking her head, very confused. Jen walked around to Miss Jorgenson's side of the desk, spinning her chair around to face her.<br />
Miss Jorgenson didn't attempt to get up, simply continuing her meek protests, &quot;Cindy's going....I can't...stop....Jennifer, quit.....we don't want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
               Jen's eyes flared red; she'd had enough of teasing. She wanted satisfaction! She grabbed her teacher by the back of the head, pulling her off the chair. Grabbing a handful of her hair, she forced Miss Jorgenson's face into her vagina, her body thrilling at the slight struggle the woman put up.<br />
<br />
             But the struggle was very slight, to say the least. Mere moments later, Jen's legs began to feel weak as her teacher's mouth began to explore her nether regions. Jen supressed her growls as she felt her body beginning to change. Jen dropped to all fours for comfort's sake as her spine began to pop. Miss Jorgenson seemed not to be phased by any of this, instead simply sliding onto her back under her favorite cheerleader, pulling Jen's crotch down onto her face. Miss Jorgenson took her with a furious need, as though Jennifer's juices were the very nectar of life itself.<br />
<br />
             Jen was unable to stifle her howl of orgasm as she ground herself on Miss Jorgenson's face, dripping more and more cum onto her. As Jen's body began to conform back to its more human dimensions,  her teacher still clung to her, until Jen finally pryed her off. Getting up, Jen pulled her panties out of her purse, putting them back on. She quickly dressed herself, and asked Miss Jorgenson, &quot; What was that about Cindy?&quot;<br />
<br />
              But Miss Jorgenson didn't truly respond coherently, still laying on the floor of the room, shivering as though she had a horrific chill. &quot;So...so...Jennifer...you...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
              Jennifer giggled a bit, realizing that even now, her teacher was being transformed internally. Whatever was in her juices that made her a werewolf, it was working its way into Miss Jorgenson's system as she watched. &quot;See you at practice, then, Miss J. I think we've got something to sort out with Cindy, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
             &quot;I...cold...you....we...Cindy...animal....you...we...I...&quot; was the only response. Smirking, Jen walked out of the office, heading back to class.</p>
