<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicity was in a foul mood as she parked in front of a non de-script gym. The gym itself was a front, the Normal using it as a training ground. The Dark Garden had training today, yet Felicity was having a difficult time focusing.<br />
<br />
Winery breaking up with Zack was a blessing and a curse. She knew that the relationship wouldn&#39;t last, Winery was at an age where she wanted something adventurous in a relationship. Yes, Zack was a great guy but he was just too safe. This now left the werewolf single, something that excited Felicity far more than she wanted to admit, but it was going to be difficult actually start dating.<br />
<br />
Not only was Felicity part of the Normal and Dark Garden, her very presence angered Winery&#39;s friends. The werewolf&#39;s friends not liking her made things easier. Chances were the Normal and One Humanity would have the Dark Garden eliminate them, but trying to face Winery was a completely different subject. Although the teen knew something major was about to take place, she wasn&#39;t sure if she could bring herself to harm Winery.<br />
<br />
Entering the gym, Felicity made her way towards the locker room. Quickly checking to make sure no one was around, she activated a secret lever, which now revealed a training area. Stepping inside the door closed behind her as she noticed Caitlin and May waiting for her. &quot;Heard that witch and her pet kitty kicked your ass, boss lady.&quot; Caitlin said with a smug smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; Felicity grumbled, noting Caitlin now quieted while maintaining that same grin. &quot;Anyone know why they wanted us here today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; Caitlin shrugged. &quot;I did see the Boss and Mokomi though. I think they have something big planned.&quot; Felicity frowned, already she was not looking forward to whatever this was. Ever since Solar Guardians Neptune and Pluto slipped through their fingers, the Boss was training them harder than ever. Chances were that today&#39;s training session would be the hardest yet. Hearing a door open, Felicity, Caitlin, and May turned to see the Boss and Mokomi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;Gather around I have to tell you something.&quot; Felicity sighed, slowly walking to where the Boss was. Glancing at her teammates, she could see Caitlin sporting the same smug expression as always as May fidgeted nervously. &quot;I&#39;ll make this brief,&quot; The Boss said. &quot;Right now you three are out-manned and outgunned. Mokomi and I decided to help even the odds.&quot; Felicity now watched curiosity as the Boss beckoned someone behind him. Slowly a figure now emerged, Felicity noting it was a teenage girl. The girl was Asian, perhaps 15 or 16 years old with shoulder length black hair and glasses perched upon her nose. As she cane into view, Felicity’s eyes grew wide as she noticed the black and pink military outfit complete with skirt. &quot;Allow me to introduce you to Michelle Wong aka Poison Lotus. She&#39;s the newest member of the Dark Garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
Five days prior<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you certain this will work?&quot; Michelle asked as she gazed at the silvery liquid contained within a small vile. &quot;Absolutely Agent Wong,&quot; Dr. Ivy replied. &quot;Remember I was the one that helped design the Clean Slate protocol.&quot; Michelle could do little more than nod, a small frown on her face as she thought about her assignment.<br />
<br />
After a parting of ways between S.P.E.A.R and the hunters, the agency found themselves scrambling. The loss of the majority of the hunters diaries was a major blow to S.P.E.A.R. Since then, Director McMillan attempted to continue to provide assistance in the ongoing operations with the Normal. That&#39;s where Michelle came in.<br />
<br />
According to Dr. Alexander Ivy, considering the recent failures the Normal experienced, the Boss would try to redouble his efforts. That was when he explained the Dark Garden and Project Clean Slate. Currently the Dark Garden, a twisted version of the classic magical girls, was contracted with the Normal. The Boss was using these girls as elite shock troopers. As of now, there were three girls but the Boss wanted more. That&#39;s where Clean Slate came in.<br />
<br />
Clean Slate was the name of a rejuvenation procedure the Normal used. The process was simple in its explanation, despite its complex science. An individual would be reverted to infancy, their mind wiped completely so that the Normal could &quot;grow&quot; the person backup to be raised by the Normal. In this way, said individual would view the Normal as family. Unwilling to question what they were retaught as they grew up. The program so far created several individuals who were undyingly loyal to their adopted family. It was perfect yet S.P.E.A.R had a countermeasure in the form of the defector scientist, Dr. Alexander Ivy.<br />
<br />
&quot;These nanites will protect your mind during the physical regression Agent Wong.&quot; Ivy stated. &quot;Remember I worked on this program with Dr. Eastly. By combining my robotics ingenuity with her specialty in genetics, we devised a way to revert a human subject to infancy. The procedure would wipe your memories completely without these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does Clean Slate work anyway?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eastly designed a virus that repairs the telomeres of DNA,&quot; he said. &quot;In essence it rewrites DNA, reverting it to a younger state. The nanite portion, which I designed, stimulate the virus to revert DNA to its original state. If my nanites aren&#39;t used, the regression is unpredictable. That&#39;s what happened with Eastly. The virus is based on the one she was afflicted with, leaving her permanently in a prepubescent state. My nantes allow the person to grow up naturally once the process is complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the nanites you&#39;re injecting me with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The brilliance of the program is that it repairs any damage done to the body.&quot; Ivy continued. &quot;I programmed them to view memories as damage. The virus will stimulate memories inside the brain, which the nanites will attack and repair. The solution I&#39;m injecting you with neutralize any nanites that enter your cerebellum. Think of them as a protective shield. You may revert to infancy but you get to keep your adult mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle sighed. When Sarah approached her about this deep cover mission, she was excited. That excitement though turned to anxiety when she found out what it entailed. &quot;According to the reports Agent Wong,&quot; Ivy stated. &quot;The Normal have a 92% chance of attempting to add a fourth member to the Dark Garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that&#39;s what Sarah said,&quot; Michelle replied. &quot;Which is why I&#39;m acting as bait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ivy nodded, a nervous look on his face as he injected Michelle with the solution. &quot;Agent Wong,&quot; Ivy said nervously. &quot;It&#39;s important to remember to stay calm during the procedure. The virus and the nanites react to chemical changes in the body. The stronger your emotional reaction, the stronger the process. If your reaction is too strong, I don&#39;t know if the nanites I injected you with will be effective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easier said than done,&quot; Michelle grumbled. &quot;I mean I&#39;m literally going to watch myself reverting to infancy in minutes. I have to figure it&#39;s going to be surreal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the thing with Clean Slate,&quot; Ivy replied sadly. &quot;Every test subject becomes frightened in the latter parts of the procedure. Everyone wants to be young but too much youth can be unsettling, especially as you watch the world grow around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Michelle said, a small smile spreading across her face. &quot;But little do these guys know, I&#39;ve always been fascinated in by science, especially mad science. I plan on asking as many questions as possible to keep myself calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Present day<br />
<br />
Michelle furrowed her brow, offering a cold introduction to her fellow Dark Garden members. Dr. Ivy wasn&#39;t lying when he said Clean Slate was frightening. When the agent awoke, she was shocked to see herself reduced to a young teen. It only got worse as she noticed her regression continue. If Ivy hadn&#39;t told her what to expect, Michelle would have panicked. Instead, the agent remained calm, letting her natural curiosity take hold as she descended into infancy. In the end, it allowed her to retain her memories.<br />
<br />
As she listened to the Boss and her fellow teenagers, Michelle now thought over her mission. This was an infiltration mission. Despite the uncertainty within S.P.E.A.R, the agency had a duty to continue to protect the supernatural from the Normal. Michelle would gather Intel, working within the Normal until the time was right. The only downside for Michelle was the fact she would be stuck as a teenager, forced to grow up once again. It was a small price to pay, even if Michelle was a bit disheartened by her predicament. Memories of her teenage insecurities front and center in the rejuvenated agents mind. If everything went as planned, Michelle and S.P.E.A.R could help turn the tide against the Normal.</p>
