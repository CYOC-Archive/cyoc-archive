<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer tried to stay awake, fearful of what any changes would bring. As the night dragged on she could feel the drowsiness setting in, desperately fighting it by pinching herself she could only wait till midnight. The light in the living room buzzed as suddenly it started to flicker, the pace increasing before turning into practically a strobe light. Jennifer looked around fearfully as she was shocked awake. She saw the walls around her being to shift, the sun rising and falling rapidly, faint flickers of people passing her by in a second. Jennifer looked down at herself as she gasped with horror as she saw her stomach get smaller and smaller before becoming flat once again, her body feeling tight as she compressed down. Glancing at her hand she could see her fingers shortening ever so slightly, her hand growing smaller. She must have become eight again. Then Jennifer screamed.<br />
<br />
A throbbing in her groin as she suddenly saw her stomach growing once again, it grew in horrible spurts, each surge causing her to try to kick in discomfort. By the time it stopped it looked even larger than before, laying down like this she couldn&#39;t even look over her baby belly. She felt trapped, the whole scenario was too much as she fainted with a sigh as the world fell into darkness.<br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up with a gasp. Breathing heavily she tried to remember what had happened, only to grab her head as a bleeding headache pierced her mind. Jennifer howled as the headache racked her brain. Looking at herself she saw the horror around her. <br />
<br />
Her attempts to try to prevent more children had failed, a tangle of new siblings, or worse, aunts and uncles laid around her. Jennifer was unable to move as her bulbous stomach prevented any core movement, she couldn&#39;t even sit up. Trying to count heads she could only see two others, Lukas for sure, now only four again, and a new face, a girl who looked very similar to Jennifer, maybe a sister, she looked about six. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; Jennifer whispered, feeling around her mouth at her new voice, it sounded brutish, and very broken, like each word spoken was the first time she had ever tried saying it. Jennifer tried saying her name and a few long syllable words, concerned with each pronunciation. <br />
<br />
Trying to speak must have woke up Sylvia as soon she appeared around the corner, thankfully on the side of Jen&#39;s stomach so she could see her. Jennifer had a hard time spying Sylvia, she looked about sixteen still, some level of good news. But it soon became soured as she then noticed Sylvia&#39;s burgeoning baby bumb, her midriff now puffed up obviously to show she was a few months pregnant. Whatever the family was now, it was still growing.<br />
<br />
Sylvia stumbled over to Jennifer as she fell to her knees to give Jennifer a wet slimy kiss. &quot;Hehe.....baby.&quot; Sylvia muttered. <br />
Oh dear gods no. Jennifer thought to herself, if Mary was fried it must have spread to Sylvia. Sylvia poked Jennifer&#39;s stomach playfully as Jennifer tried to shoo her away. She acted more of a child than herself, if Sylvia had a brain of what was probably a two year old, would she get better or worse in time, if her mother become a drooling idiot who only had sex what would that mean for herself? Jennifer was still ever so fearful of the future, or past at this point. She had yet to meet Justin and Mary in this timeline, maybe they were better off.<br />
<br />
As the day progressed the answer never came, Jennifer soon found she was throughly stuck, her belly was just too much at this size and she was dependant on the other kids and Sylvia. Lukas and the girl, named Abby were barely any more help than her own mother. The three of them played with what was around and food was mostly spilled before reaching Jennifer. What was worse was needing to use the bathroom, holding it was no option and being unable to move only exasperated the feeling of filth Jennifer felt. The only thing worse was her nipples, it seemed to be a trait now that both Sylvia and Jennifer had started to leak milk. Jennifer cursed as it felt like her nipples were always on fire, as if someone was constantly pinching them. Jennifer never had more than a single drop, her breast&#39;s still hadn&#39;t formed yet, but the feeling persisted. Sylvia however was a mainstay in the kids meals, even Jennifer was offered it, Sylvia&#39;s swollen and bruised tit swaying like a pendulum above Jennifer&#39;s face as she desperately tried to reach up to catch it with her mouth. She was hesitant at first, but without any other source of fluid and certainly unable to request the complicated task of getting water in a cup, it was her only option.<br />
<br />
As the day carried on Jennifer&#39;s heart sank as she once again saw Justin, the sudden uncle. He came out of Mary&#39;s room, or maybe what used to be her room, only to kiss Jennifer and Sylvia before grasping Sylvia&#39;s waist and pushing her down doggy style infront of the family. Sylvia grunted and moaned as she was dicked down by her brother as the two other kids barely paid attention to the scene. After it was over Justin pulled out to leave Sylvia grinning stupidly on the ground. His gaze fell on Jennifer as he stroked her belly. It quivered in response, or maybe it was her groin, either way Jennifer was repulsed, no matter what her body felt or remembered, her mind had no feelings for this mystery man. Feeling the nervousness, Justin retreated back to his room. <br />
<br />
As the night began to set in, Jennifer made it a goal to stand up, using Lukas and Abby as crutches and with Sylvia picking her up on her feet, Jennifer was able to waddle over slowly to Mary&#39;s old room. As she creaked the door slightly she saw it.<br />
<br />
Mary was landed on the bed, cum, dried and fresh splattered her body, she giggled mindlessly as Justin continued to use her as his personal cum dumpster. She gave no resistance, no agency of her own. Her hips thrusted in the air whenever she was touched, her mouth puckered and sucked on air whenever she felt anything close. Over the years, somehow, Justin had reduced Mary to nothing but a living sex-toy, rented out for others pleasures. Sylvia was already down that same road....and soon, Jennifer would be next.</p>
