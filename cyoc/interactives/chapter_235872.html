<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The curse had browsed through Kyle&#39;s life, looking at all the instances of bullying and finding that his life was relatively peaceful, the only person that had really actively bullied him was Jen. She had not only pants him last week, but had been responsible for most of his bullying recently, either directly, or by spreading rumors. But the curse couldn&#39;t target her, so it looked into her family, was there someone who caused her to be a bully? It didn&#39;t take long to find what it was looking for, and when it did it set to work.<br />
<br />
Jen walked down the stairs and into the kitchen, then froze, the woman in the kitchen wasn&#39;t her mom, but it was. There were subtle differences in her, she was dressed more conservatively, she was humming a song, her mother was usually groggy and surly at this time of morning, her hair was different, a shorter cut and looked like her natural brunette hair color. She turned around and Jen knew something was off, the enhancements she had gotten were gone, this was a different woman, and time froze as her reality adjusted. Her hair remained it&#39;s blonde color, but her clothes changed, her skirt shifted into a pair of jeans, her sneakers turned black, and her top changed from her cheerleader top to a black t shirt, framed with a long sleeve flannel shirt.<br />
<br />
She felt the clashing realities smother her, her new life becoming more real, her old one becoming like a dream, she was smarter, she wasn&#39;t a cheerleader, she sat with the freaks and geeks even though she was prettier enough to sit with the popular kids. Her personality clashed with her old one, her snide, shallow self fading away to be replaced by a tomboy attitude, with plenty of nerdy knowledge entering her head. And for the first time she felt pity and remorse. What had she done? To herself? To her old mom? To Kyle?<br />
<br />
Time sped back up and her other smiled at her.<br />
<br />
“Good morning honey! Ready for school?”<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
“No fucking way....” Kyle muttered as he stared at the woman standing before him, his eyes caught on her ample chest and name tag on her right breast. “Jessica Smith?!? Jen&#39;s mom! I don&#39;t even know you!”<br />
<br />
Jessica Smith, the old one, was nearly forty, and was the spitting image of the stereotypical trophy wife. She was tall, six foot even, leaving her bust even with Kyle&#39;s head, even without the heels, her heart shaped face was framed by long dark rooted blond hair, pulled back in a ponytail that reached halfway down her back. She had a thin but curvy figure, the slim hourglass type, with wide hips and large breasts, long slender legs and a firm plush ass. Her breasts were her most noticeable feature, having obviously been enhanced, the melon sized breasts strained the too small blouse she was wearing, threatening to pop a button at any second. She was clad in business attire, a white button down blouse, a black skirt, black nylons, four inch heels.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt every inch of his new second half, feeling awkward in heels, but completely natural at the same time. He shuddered, both of his bodies shivering as he adjusted to the feeling of having a second body. The shock of this curse numbing him to all of the moral implications of this situation, he could only concentrate on existing for a few seconds. He tried to make her talk.<br />
<br />
“Eee.” She strained, “Ahhh, Ahhhhhh.” She tried to talk, he couldn&#39;t make her move and he worried that he now had a flesh and blood manikin to deal with when another wave of shivers hit them both. New knowledge hit their shared mind, the both moaned as the thoughts flooded in, giving knowledge of how to take care of their new bodies&#39; hygiene, their past history, why they had implants, that they couldn&#39;t make her pregnant for... reasons. The curse forced all of these thoughts in their dual minds and suddenly stopped.<br />
<br />
“FUCK!” She shouted. “WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO US!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK!” Kyle shouted. “FUCKING CURSE!”<br />
<br />
They both panted as they regained composure, finally getting a grip they shakily stood up, he looked at her and back at himself through both eyes. He walked over to her and she reacted, both under his control as he hugged himself, face pressed into her impressive bust, he got a hard on almost instantly.<br />
<br />
“Shh. We don&#39;t have time for that Kyle, we have to get to school, remember?” She said to themselves.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, how are we going to do this? I can&#39;t....” <br />
<br />
“We can, we&#39;re two halves of the same mind, we can control ourselves separately, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, now that we “remember”<br />
<br />
“Good, now we need some asprin, and some food, come on, let&#39;s go.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re not going to change that shirt?”<br />
<br />
“I applies to dress code, they can&#39;t stop me.”<br />
<br />
“Okay....” Kyle paused.<br />
<br />
“Later stud. Work first, play later. Now, breakfast.” The went down the hall to the kitchen where their mother was now making twice the amount of waffles for them.<br />
<br />
“Good morning my Kyles.” She said to them, “Breakfast is almost ready. Kyle, looking great as always, both of you!” She chirped, she always payed compliments to him every morning, They looked at each other and smiled slightly. She turned around with two plates of waffles and set them down.<br />
<br />
“Now eat up, the bus will be here soon.” <br />
<br />
Eating came naturally, the separate halves of his hive mind controlling themselves as they thought, how was Jen going to take this, she surely didn&#39;t think it would be like this, but it was her own fault, but still, she must be taking this hard. They would find out soon enough, Kyle grabbed his back pack, his female half grabbed her messenger bag and they went off to wait for the bus, they would have a long day starting with meeting with Jen.</p>
