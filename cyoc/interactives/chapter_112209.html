<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Frances’s brother meeting her as well as mom and dad at Grrrrrrr; it was a tense moment before Angelica hugged her son. Still in his police uniform and technically on duty still. Samson told his family that the police department can survive an hour or two without him as he dines with his family. Entering the establishment, the four are greeted by the door attendant. Whiles Frances is all too familiar with the spiel, this was Joseph, Angelica and Samson’s first time at Grrrrrrr. Hearing of the rules to dine, made Samson laugh, while both Joseph and Angelica look at the daughter.<br />
<br />
Not seeing their son already removing his clothes and assuming his Alaskan Malamute fursona; Frances just smiles and say “go with it for a change.” Joseph sighing as Frances quickly assumes her were-cat fursona; with her auburn fur covering her head to paw, Joseph was next to shift into his fursona. Being a were-dog, Joseph’s fursona is that of a bloodhound. With brown fur covering him head to paw; Joseph had the distinctive feature that marked him as a bloodhound. The large floppy ears falling beside his head, soulful looking eyes and heavy jowls that give him a perpetual look of melancholy.<br />
<br />
It was Angelica’s fursona that made the family stop and stare. Not because she adopted an exotic form; but because all see her clutching her abdomen, clearly in pain as she shifts. Her form that of a sleek grey furred greyhound with bright amber eyes. Hearing her whimper as her change finishes makes Frances cry. <br />
“Is it the cancer causing you pain mom,” Frances asking.<br />
“Every time,” Angelica wincing; “my doctor said it will only get worse as time goes on.”<br />
“You should be in the hospital,” Samson placing a paw on her shoulder; “recovering like you did last time.”<br />
“It’s not like last time son,” Angelica sighing as they are let into the dining area; “this cancer is terminal. Even with chemo and radiation,” Looking at Samson as they sit down; “son I’m dying.”<br />
<br />
The party fell into silence afterwards. The only time words were spoken was when Ben, having his tryout shift for “busboy/waiter” came over to take their drink orders. Surprised to see his mom and her brother and to be serving them; the werewolf was quickly introduce to Joseph and Angelica. Explaining to her parents that Samantha and she adopted Ben shortly after his parents passed away in a tragic accident; did not help improve the cold pallor of dread among the table.<br />
<br />
The first course that Ben served was the restaurants take on a Waldorf salad. Despites Frances’s low appetite, she did find the salad tasty and slightly fruity. Watching her parents eat the simple lettuce and fruit concoction like starved puppies; Frances wondered when the last time her parents had a proper meal. Seeing Samson slowly eat the salad; it was clear to Frances, that her brother was more of a meat lover. She shakes her head as Samson grumbles at having to suffer through rabbit food when his nose picked up the wonderful scent of cooking meat coming from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long after that Ben came back with the entrée. Samson seeing the trio of sliders made him growl happily as his tongue rolls out of his maw; salivating at the three different two to three bite burgers, served with steak frites and a tangy coleslaw. Samson’s tail was wagging furiously as he bit into his first slider.<br />
“Oh that is soooooo good,” Samson smiling through his Malamute muzzle.<br />
“Are each of them different,” Joseph looking at each slider; “which one do I eat first?”<br />
“Just pick one and bite into it Joseph,” Angelica chuckling; “the middle slider I think is lamb.”<br />
“With rendered bacon fat,” Samson speaking with a maw full of food.”<br />
 <br />
Frances looked at her food with a heavy sigh. Seeing the text from Samantha about her press conference and missing it; the were-cat among three were-dogs really didn’t feel like eating. Discreetly sending a reply and letting her know of what’s going on with a promise to talk later; Frances puts her phone back down a picks up a slider biting into it. She chews the meat slowly trying to figure it out. Not knowing she just ate a blend of wild boar and bison served with a sundried tomato and bbq sauce.<br />
“That burger had a nice gamey taste to it,” Samson speaking; “didn’t it sis.”<br />
“I can’t place the meat,” France answering as finishes the slider; finding it juicy and flavorful. “But it was tasty.”<br />
“This one,” Joseph finishing his slider; “is just plain beef. But the cheese is unusual.”<br />
“Its blue cheese,” Frances sniffing the far left slider on her plate; “It looks a bit greasy.”<br />
“That’s the onions,” Angelica chiming in; “just eat your food daughter.”<br />
“So what will the next course be,” Samson staring at his empty plate.<br />
“It will be dessert,” Frances speaking; “I don’t know what you will be served. But for me it will be like last time I was here. A bowl of mint ice cream sitting on top of some rice pudding,” Frances licking her muzzle like a cat; “infused with cat nip. Samantha and I licked our bowls clean when it was served for us.”<br />
“That must have been some dessert then,” Joseph speaking up as he sips his ice water.<br />
<br />
Frances doesn’t answer as she forces herself to finish her last slider and the coleslaw. Taking a few bites of the steak frites, she sees her adoptive werewolf son coming by with desert. Already smelling the cat nip coming from the rice pudding dessert; Frances was quickly savaging her bowl as her parents and brother were each served bacon infused crème-Brule with a marrow bone sticking out from the top. All three watch as Frances quickly devours her dessert like savage beast.<br />
“Take a breath sis,” Samson looking stunned; “don’t choke yourself.”<br />
“Cat nip affects us were-felines,” Frances now looking wired; “just as bad as regular cats. It’s why I couldn’t keep the bowl down until I licked it clean.”<br />
“And from the looks of it,” Angelica looking at her daughter; “you’re looking for seconds.”<br />
“So everyone is served the same meal here,” Joseph taking a bite of his dessert; “but dessert is different.”<br />
“That is what makes this place successful dad,” Frances looking calmer; “each dessert is unique to suit the individuals fursona.”<br />
“A marrow bone,” Samson taking his; “because our fursonas are based off of canines?”<br />
“I can’t answer that brother,” Frances speaking up while looking at the time on her phone.<br />
“You need to be somewhere,” Angelica speaking.<br />
“I have a patient for four pm,” Frances answering; “but I told my office assistance that if I’m not back by thee thirty to go ahead and reschedule it.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ben was in the kitchen chugging back a glass of water with his left paw, while using his right to scratch the back of his lupine head. Not expecting his job interview to involve an actual work shift for who knows how long; let alone his mother showing up for lunch with her estranged family. Ben was starting to reconsider Nates offer to come work for him when the owner of the establishment, a were-fox marking him as an artic fox variant approached.<br />
“I think I’ve seen enough for today,” the vulpine man speaking; “you did okay for someone who has no experience in this field. That last table you served,” The were-fox speaking; “you were a nervous wreck.”<br />
“You try serving your mother and her family on your first day,” Ben answering.<br />
“Oh,” the were-fox twitching his ears in surprise; “I guess that explains the nervousness then.”<br />
“So do we have a new busy boy then, “the were-badger cook speaking; “or are you going to rope me and my line into waiters for diner service again?”<br />
“Don’t badger me right now Andy,” the were-fox growling; “you still might have to do that as we are still short pawed.”<br />
“That’s what you get when you hire were-cats and other feline weres and they serve the rice pudding dessert to the patrons,” Andy grousing; “I told you before Jake…”<br />
“Shut up,” Jake the were-fox snapping; “I’m not having this argument with you again. I don’t care if you married my sister, bring this up again and you’ll be looking for work as well.”<br />
<br />
The were-fox escorting Ben back to the office and having him take a seat as he closes the door.<br />
“Sorry about that,” Jake speaking up; “my brother in-law can’t help but beat a dead horse. I had you do a portion of our lunch service,” Jake answering; “because I need to see how you’d react to some of the situations a server comes across. The were-otters being rude and insulting to you was not part of the test.”<br />
“Why did they treat me like that,” Ben unable to help himself as he growled.<br />
“Its because of the whole mess the Luna Brotherhood is in,” Jake answering; “you know of what the Seattle chapter did right?”<br />
<br />
Ben nods as he and every werewolf in his pack heard of how Alyssa Cooper had her throat ripped out at the order of a Beta because, Julie Stovall would not give them sport with a pack hunt. Julie being the prey that the pack would track down, despite the fact that she was a fugitive and the Luna Brotherhood duty bound to bring her back to custody.<br />
<br />
“Suffice to say,” Jake sighing; “the Luna brotherhood the world over is in turmoil from that. The werewolves not a part of the organization are feeling the brunt of it as the various were-communities look at them with suspicion.”<br />
“This is the first time I’m hearing this,” Ben looking concerned; “but what does it have to do with the job interview?”<br />
“It doesn’t have anything to do with the job interview,” Jake sighs; “the were-otters ragging on you; they moved to town recently and are from one of those were-communities. They brought their prejudices with them. Refusing to serve those werewolves that came for lunch earlier, I had no choice but to fire them.”<br />
“So now you are really short pawed,” Ben speaking.<br />
“That and my tail caught in the door as it closes,” Jake grimacing; “Your still in high school correct?”<br />
“Yes,” Ben answering; “I know my availability will be limited as a result, but my weekends as free as far as I know.”<br />
“It’s a start,” Jake rifling through some papers; “come back tomorrow to fill out some paperwork and we’ll see about getting your hours worked out. Welcome to Grrrrrrr Benjamin Twist.”</p>
