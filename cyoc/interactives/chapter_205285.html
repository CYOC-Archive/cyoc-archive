<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your own daughter, Emelie, was standing in the door. She threw herself around you as soon as you opened the door and started crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;First my father died a few months ago and now you lost your memory?&quot; She sobbed. Wait? You died a few months ago? You had been to self involved to think about the date - how long had you been nothing but a brain, exactly? But before you could think about that much longer you patted Emelie on the head and said &quot;Things will be okay, Emelie&quot; without thinking. Oh shit! Did you just give yourself away? <br />
<br />
&quot;You, You remember me?&quot; Emelie said with a smile. Right, you just dodged a bullet with explaining how you knew Emelie. You&#39;d just have to feign that something deep inside you remembered her name. Your new parents looking at you with hopeful eyes. They thought they were getting their son back. <br />
<br />
Your new parents excused themselves and said &quot;Maye you&#39;ll remember something else if you spend some time together? We&#39;ll be out of your way&quot; as they put their jackets on and went outside, closing the door behind them. <br />
<br />
Emelie looked behind her and took you by the hand. &quot;Follow me upstairs, I know something that might help with your memory a bit more&quot; she whispered, in a tone you couldn&#39;t help but feel sounded seductive. This sounded bad. But you obediently followed along. Hopefully your intuition was wrong. In the worst case scenario, you&#39;d just stop her. You wanted to try out your new large member, sure, but not with your... Well, Donald&#39;s daughter. She was your girlfriend now. But you had been Donald the rest of your life, mind you. You raised this girl. But as she lead you upstairs, you couldn&#39;t help but glance at her figure. She reminded you of Donald&#39;s wife. When you still were Donald, you found his wife quite sexy.  But even if you were William now, finding this girl attractive was wrong, right? You kept looking at Emelie&#39;s tight ass swinging back and forth as she walked up the stairs. Turned out your large member enjoyed the view at the very least because your pants were getting really tight. <br />
<br />
As you got inside your room, Emelie looked deep into your eyes. That&#39;s when she pressed her lips against yours. But rather than pushing her away, you actually liked it and let it happen. Her tongue was now inside your mouth. After a little while, she let go. &quot;So, did that help you remember something?&quot; She asked. &quot;No, sorry!&quot; you said. &quot;Well, maybe this will help&quot; Emelie said, bending down. You knew this was wrong, but your new body definitely liked Emelie. A lot. You were at this point kind of hoping something would happen. She pulled your pants down and your massive meat sprung out, hitting her in the face. She giggled as she said &quot;Someone remembers me, doesn&#39;t he?&quot;. Emelie took your fat cock in her tiny hands and started to stroke it. You really should stop her, but it did feel good and besides, who cares if William fucks Donald&#39;s daughter? Nothing wrong was going on, You were William and William was just having a good time with his girlfriend. Donald was dead. &quot;That feels good&quot; you moaned. &quot;I want more&quot; you said. Emelie looked up on you &quot;Only if it&#39;s helping. What&#39;s my favorite color?&quot; This was an easy question. She had loved purple all her life. &quot;Purple?&quot; You answered. Emelie now guided your penis into her warm wet mouth and started to suck it. Emelie was good. She was better than Donald&#39;s wife. Well, figures. That old loser and his tiny cock obviously wouldn&#39;t get head like William would. Being William was clearly better in all respects. But you wanted even more. <br />
<br />
You decided to be forceful and pulled your throbbing member out of Emelie&#39;s sweet mouth. You spun her around and pushed her against the floor. Her head to the ground and ass in the air. &quot;This is the Will I remember&quot; She said. &quot;Fuck me, Fuck me now!&quot; She screamed. You pulled her pants down and was greeted by an amazing pussy. Couldn&#39;t help but think it reminded you of her mothers. But as you penetrated her, you could tell she was an upgrade in every way. First you get upgraded to being William and now, now you were enjoying your former daughters flesh which was an upgrade to her mother. &quot;Oh fuck, I love that big cock&quot; she screamed. Damn, Emelie liked to talk dirty. Her mother never did. But who cared about some old broad? You cared at the moment only about the attractive woman you were fucking with your massive manhood. Emelie was a fine woman and maybe it was best you were here to take care of her? She deserved someone like you. That was both William and Donald talking. A dad that wants what&#39;s best for his daughter and you, the sexy man that wanted to fuck this amazing woman. Because again, who cared if William wanted to fuck Emelie? She didn&#39;t have to know you used to be Donald, her father. You were William now and loved it. Emelie clearly loved it as well. <br />
<br />
As you kept fucking in all kinds of positions you couldn&#39;t help but think your stamina was an upgrade as well. Donald would never have been able to please a woman this long. But for William, this was easy. After 50 minutes of fucking, you came. Hard. You pulled out and came all over Emelie. The sight was amazing. So amazing you were rock hard faster than you had gotten limp from cumming. Emelie was clearly used to this and simply scoped the sperm of her body and swallowed it. She than brought your cock into her mouth. Just as good as before. This round was more gentle. After yet another 30 minutes you came again. This time in the missionary position while inside of her. Filling Emelie with your cum. <br />
<br />
Yeah, being William was great. Fucking Emelie was great. At this point you were ready to completely let go of Donald. Because doing so would mean you didn&#39;t have to justify fucking Emelie and not fucking her, being with her, was not an option anymore.</p>
