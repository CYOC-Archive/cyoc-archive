<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rays of sunlight escaped through the coverings of the windows in Luka&#39;s room, quickly gracing her closed eyes, the female Rider gave an annoyed groan as she slowly woke up, rubbing her eyes as she put on her slippers, &quot;Come on Karyu! Wakey wakey!&quot; said Luka as she gently pushed her demonic drake, who gave an adorable growl, &quot;Hng... Five more minutes...&quot; growled Karyu, unwillingly using his eldritch voice, &quot;It&#39;s ten in the morning! Wake up you lazy dragon!&quot; said Luka as she started to lose her temper, &quot;Fine! If you don&#39;t want to wake up, then i&#39;ll have to tickle you!&quot; she said, with a devilish smirk on her lips, this made Karyu open his eyes wide as he quickly got up, &quot;That&#39;s what i thought.&quot; said Luka as she looked at her drawer, putting on her tunic as she headed towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
To her suprise, Teach was guarding the bathroom door, the golden drake quickly saw his Rider&#39;s sister, who was slowly approaching him.<br />
&quot;Sorry, Tammy is occupying the bathroom.&quot; Said Teach with a sad voice, this made Luka sigh.<br />
&quot;Hold on, let me talk to her.&quot; Said Luka, she knew that her sister locked the room, so she had no choice but to shout through the door, &quot;Tammy! Hurry up!&quot; shouted Luka.<br />
&quot;No! Me and Teach had a messy night! You bathed last night so it&#39;s my turn now!&quot; Protested Tammy, as she poured the hot water on her soft skin, Tammy barely gets four hours of sleep a day, and this day is no exception, even if her fetus didn&#39;t develop enough to give her a noticeable look, this didn&#39;t change the fact that Teach filled her with buckets of his drake-seed, &quot;Since you&#39;re awake, why don&#39;t you make breakfast! After all, you need to feed your children also!&quot; finished Tammy.<br />
Tammy was right, since Luka was awake, she should be the one to make breakfast, plus she also needed to feed her children, without hesitation, she quickly went downstairs preparing breakfast for her family.<br />
<br />
A few hours have passed, the entire family was in the dining room eating their breakfast, all except Luka, who was feeding her two Kilin children, laughing playfully as their mother feeded them.<br />
&quot;M...&quot; Started one of the Kilins, this caught the attention of Teach as he looked at them, &quot;M-Momma!&quot; the two Kilins said together, Luka and Karyu gasped, meanwhile Teach and Tammy smiled.<br />
&quot;Their first word!&quot; Said Luka triumphantly as she quickly hugged both of them with tears of happiness streaming down her face, Karyu  quickly went towards his children and his Rider, covering all of them in his midnight black wings in a loving embrace.<br />
The two stood there hugging their offsprings, Tammy smiled as she saw her sister being happy, &quot;Soon you&#39;ll feel the same happiness, isn&#39;t that right, my queen?&quot; asked Teach teasingly as he chuckled with his deep voice.<br />
Tammy rolled her eyes, &quot;I guess so, my king.&quot; replied Tammy with a teasing voice, the golden drake chuckled as he quickly pressed his lips with the ones of his Rider, in a warm kiss.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes, Luka and her family were in the living room, discussing on what they should do.<br />
&quot;So, what should we do?&quot; Asked Karyu, as she looked at his Rider, cradling her children in her arms.<br />
&quot;I saw a cave nearby, maybe we should explore it?&quot; Suggested Tammy, ever since she was born, Tammy was gifted with a perfect eyesight, being capable of catching details that others couldn&#39;t, meanwhile Luka, was born with excellent hearing capabilities.<br />
&quot;I have no problem exploring the cave.&quot; Said Luka, &quot;But first i need to give my children to Avelia or Anija, i&#39;m to scared to leave them alone.&quot; finished Luka.<br />
&quot;Well, then what are we waiting for? Let&#39;s go!&quot; Said Teach as the family got up, and headed towards the location of the cave.<br />
<br />
An hour has passed, Luka gave her children to Avelia and Anija, promising that they both would take care of them while she was gone, Luka and her family were walking in a dense forest trying to locate the cave, the two sisters were the ones leading the march speaking of possible names for their childrens, meanwhile Teach told Karyu about his romantic session with Tammy.<br />
&quot;So, how did it feel?&quot; Asked Karyu, as he looked at Teach with an interested look in his face.<br />
&quot;It felt too good, you were right about it, mating female humans is much better than mating hens.&quot; Replied Teach, remembering his session with Tammy.<br />
&quot;Hey now, i hope you&#39;re not thinking of mating with human women all the time, after all with a body like yours, every hen would beg you for a clutch.&quot; Said Karyu, with a smile.<br />
&quot;Oh shut up, you look much better than me, especially with those horns.&quot; Said Teach as he looked at Karyu&#39;s ruby-like horns, &quot;Those horns of yours could make any hen melt before you.&quot; finished Teach, the golden drake had to switch in the form of a hen once, which caused him to keep some of the female hormones.<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not thinking about turning into a hen and force me to mount you.&quot; Said Karyu with a worried voice, looking at the golden drake.<br />
&quot;Maybe i&#39;m thinking about it, who knows?&quot; Asked Teach teasingly with the same deep chuckle.<br />
Ofcourse, Tammy heard the discussion between the two drakes, she wouldn&#39;t mind if Teach switched his gender and mated with Karyu, nor did Luka.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not stopping you!&quot; Said Tammy, this made Karyu blush as the golden drake looked at him.<br />
&quot;L-Luka, could you help me with this situation?&quot; Asked Karyu kindly, while the golden drake licked his lips seductively.<br />
&quot;Sorry, if Tammy decides then i have no choice but to follow her lead.&quot; Answered Luka, giving her sister a high five, this made Karyu&#39;s face even more red.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry i&#39;m just joking.&quot; Said Teach, &quot;But i have to admit, you&#39;re really attractive.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
After more minutes of walking, Luka and her family reached the cave, Tammy looked at the entrance, she couldn&#39;t see anything but the endless darkness within the cave.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t see anything.&quot; Said Tammy, &quot;But it dosen&#39;t look dangerous.&quot; she finished.<br />
By just looking at the entrance, Karyu felt as if something was calling for him, begging for him to enter the cave, at first he was hesitant, maybe it could be a sick trick made by the Cultists to lure dragons like him into a trap, but that didn&#39;t stop him from entering it.<br />
Just as Karyu entered the cave, his horns started shining, creating a red light illuminating the entire cave, Teach, Tammy and Luka slowly entered the cave.<br />
On the floor there were multiple tattered robes, with a weird symbol on each one, Luka instantly recognized the symbol, &quot;Wait, this is Madurai&#39;s symbol, was this place some form of sacred temple?&quot; asked Luka as she inspected the old robes, meanwhile Tammy and Teach looked at the walls, multiple beautiful carvings were in the stone, depicting great events when the great dragon gods existed, &quot;Luka! Karyu! You two might wanna see this!&quot; said Tammy as she looked at one of the walls, Luka and Karyu quickly went towards her, on the wall Tammy was inspecting, there was a masterpiece of a painting, depicting a great demonic dragon with red and black scales with six magnificent wings and horns resembling antlers!<br />
&quot;Is it me or does that painting kind of resemble Karyu?&quot; Asked Teach, with an interested voice.<br />
&quot;Well, the coloration of the scales and of the horns does resemble Karyu&#39;s one.&quot; Said Tammy as she looked at Karyu, who gave an innocent look.<br />
&quot;No way, i do not belive that my sweet dragon Karyu is some form of dragon god.&quot; Said Luka as she patted her dragon, little did Luka know that Karyu was indeed a dragon god, walking in the mortal realm.</p>
