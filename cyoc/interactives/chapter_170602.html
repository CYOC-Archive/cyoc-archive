<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson did admit that while he did see himself as straight, and usually was not the type to go around with guys, this was also a new and exciting point for him. He was young again and so was Percy. And they could get even younger still with the assistance of the Chronivac. So Jackson decided maybe it was time to try out some experimentation tonight. &quot;Alright,&quot; Jackson started, &quot;I&#39;m not about to change my sexuality, but we&#39;re now in a unique spot with this. I&#39;m good to experiment with my sexuality.&quot; While he was nowhere near as confident with guys as he would be with women, Jackson was willing to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh excellent!&quot; Percy said with a grin and a look of eager anticipation. Percy crossed his more muscular than prior arms, and walked over, feeling Jackson&#39;s shoulders in a rather flirtatious way, &quot;And don&#39;t you worry Jackson, I&#39;ll be as gentle and instructive as possible. I know your first time going gay can be intimidating, but I&#39;ll keep your comfort zone in mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson chuckled, seeing one of Percy&#39;s hands starting to move toward Jackson&#39;s ass, &quot;Ah ah, after I check on Oliver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know where to find me.&quot; Percy threw himself on to the bed in the private room, and started undoing his shirt&#39;s buttons, eager to start the seductive act. Jackson knew Percy well enough to know he was always happy to go out with women, men and any combination thereof. He was not nearly as well experienced, and he hoped Percy would do as he said.<br />
<br />
Jackson slowly left the private room just in time to hear the sound of the shirt being thrown on the side of the bed. He started to look around and scanned the crowd looking for good old Oliver. And there he was. The damages of years of alcohol abuse and overindulgence in food and drink being undone in real time. While his knee was not repaired yet, it was really inspirational to watch Oliver slowly recovering from its effects.<br />
<br />
Even Lilah was seeming a bit astonished by the wellness that her husband was displaying. &quot;My, Oliver,&quot; Jackson overheard them talking as he moved closer in toward the food and drink, &quot;You seem lively today. Very lively.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Lilah, but it&#39;s definitely something. I feel great! Maybe it&#39;s just the air in here. I have never felt healthier in years!&quot; How right he was, and how much further did Jackson intend to take his old friend. He fetched the Chronivac from his pocket and started looking over the info. Jackson could see that Oliver was almost done changing. Maybe he could push a bit further and have Oliver&#39;s knee heal up. Considering it looked like most people weren&#39;t exactly alarmed, more delighted for Oliver.<br />
<br />
Jackson went ahead and decided to regress Oliver again by another 8 years, which would put Oliver back into his late twenties and before the point when he&#39;d damaged his knee. It would be pretty interesting to see if anyone noticed a difference in Oliver. The revelry seemed to be well underway! <br />
<br />
Jackson started the new transformation, and decided he would check in again as soon as he was able. He looked forward to seeing what came of giving Oliver his youth and vitality back. He then started to look around and check in to see who else was around. Considering people had invites they could give to others, he did see some people younger than his usual crowd. There was a twenty-something young actor, blond well coiffed hair and a muscled physique, sitting in one of the rooms, making out on the sofa with his girlfriend, a red haired bombshell with tits that made Jackson quiver a bit.<br />
<br />
Why not give them a bit of a change too?<br />
<br />
Jackson fired up the Chronivac and got their information; the guy was Lukas Vinston, up and coming, and a bit of a heartthrob. He was smooth and hairless across his well muscled physique. The woman was Emily Stanton, a wealthy producer&#39;s daughter who was evidently here with her dad. And now she was off making out with her actor boyfriend. Grinning a bit, Jackson decided to add some muscle on to Lukas. He&#39;d be on the level of early Arnold by the time he was done changing - and Jackson decided to give him another year or two of age to grow into his new physique, and for Emily he decided to just heighten everything that was already lovely about her.<br />
<br />
He would need to likewise check in with these two later. Now, he had an experiment to engage. As he headed off toward the private room, he pulled up Percy&#39;s stats, looking at him at 35. Hmm...maybe. Nah. He&#39;d go with changing Percy at request.<br />
<br />
As Jackson returned to the private room, he saw Percy sprawled out on the bed, shirtless, and flexing his abs, hand behind his head, &quot;Ah hello there, Jackson, I&#39;ve been expecting you. Get comfy, I&#39;ll guide you through the whole of this.&quot; Jackson started to take his own shirt off and headed toward the bed...</p>
