<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler, Jeff’s 12-year-old brother, who, like Jeff, has black hair but styled in an undercut, he has dark-green eyes, like his mother and his body is athletic since he does a lot of sports. Tyler’s personality is on one side mischievous and on the other side extremely curious, especially at his age where kids start to discover their sexuality and start to experiment.<br />
<br />
The 12-year-old is currently on his why home from spending the afternoon with his best friend “Jordan”, who is a year younger than Tyler, they had a fun game of soccer in the park and Tyler’s team won. Tyler is still grinning about the score he and his team achieved, 7-3 with him scoring the most goals. He decided to leave the park early enough, so that he could have a rest and shower before dinner, since it is a one hour walk from the park to his home.<br />
<br />
‘I wonder if Jeff is home,’ the boy thinks to himself, ‘and that he’d let me play some UNO on his computer after I shower.’ Tyler and Jeff have a good relationship with each other, sure they argue and fight most of the time, but that is what siblings tend to do, and Tyler is aware that he can be a real pain in the butt at times.<br />
<br />
Tyler soon arrives home, he notices that his parents are still out, since the driveway is empty and the garage open with no cars to be seen. Since the garage is connected to the house, Tyler decides to enter the house through the garage, he knows that the door is always unlocked, which he and Jeff both find not safe. They had told their parents about the dangers, which could happen if the wrong person would find out, but their parents simply always tell them to not worry, that they live in a peaceful neighborhood which never had any break-ins. After at least five times of telling their parents to lock the door and continuing to get ignored, Tyler and Jeff just gave up.<br />
<br />
Tyler turns the doorknob, and when the door opens without difficulty, he shakes his head and lets out a sigh. The boy enters the house and closes the door behind him, “I’M HOME,” he calls and waits a few seconds, but no one answers, “guess I’m alone. Oh well, I hope Jeff left his Computer on, he won’t mind if I play a little, maybe he has some cool new game. First though, I need a shower… I’m a stinker.”<br />
<br />
Unaware to Tyler, Jeff is at home, but not as himself, the “Doll”, which still is sitting on the Chair in front of his Computer, wearing Jeff’s clothes and the noticeable “tent” in the Jeans, starts to panic the second he heard Tyler calling. ‘Oh shit…,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I hope he does not come into my room and finds me. I don’t look like myself, what if he mistakes me for a simply “strange” toy or doll? What if he takes me away? What if he notices my Computer is just in Stand-by, he’ll find the program and knowing him start to mess with it… shit… shit… shit!’<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tyler has headed to the bathroom, he turns on the water and strips off his sweaty clothes. The boy steps into the shower and lets out a relaxed sigh as the warm water soaks his body. Tyler looks down at himself and smiles, he takes real pride in how athletic his body is, he has well trained ABS, almost a noticeable six-pack. His bum is well trained, bubbly and firm, he does get teased because of it, some call him names like “Bubble-Butt”, “hey there girly-butt”, amongst other things, but Tyler just ignores them. The boy strokes his body and lets out soft moans of pleasure, his body pretty sensitive, especially when he strokes, rubs and squeezes his butt, the boy can’t help but to moan. Tyler notices his penis twitch as it starts to erect, he grins down at it, for a 12-year-old, when his cock reaches its full erect state, it is at least 6 inches, which is not common for 12-year-olds and Tyler is pretty proud of it. After playing with his body and cock, Tyler starts to soap himself in, continuing to moan, “dang… my body is so freaking sensitive,’ he says to himself, grinning, “hehe… I love my body. Especially my “Tyler Junior”, hehe… about time I get a girlfriend.” Smirking at the thought of ramming his big cock into a pussy, Tyler rinses himself off and turns off the water. The boy steps out of the shower and dries himself off, he then sprays himself in his Deodorant and looks over at the pile of clean clothing. Tyler grins and decides to stay nude, the boy loves running around naked, the feeling of cool air on his body always feels so good, especially on a hot day like this. “Besides,” Tyler says, as he opens the door and steps out into the hallway, grinning, “no one’s home for at least 3 more hours. Why not enjoy myself? Now… let’s see what cool games Jeff has on his Laptop, I hope he left it running,” with that, Tyler heads to Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
Tyler opens the door to Jeff’s room and walks inside, he closes the door behind him and walks around the bookshelf Jeff had built up to hide his bed. When turning the corner and looking towards Jeff’s desk, the boy stops dead in his tracks when he sees someone with brown hair sitting at Jeff’s Laptop, his back turned to Tyler. Tyler is frozen in shock and surprise, quickly covering his privates and blushing, “so-sorry… I… I didn’t know Jeff had a fr-friend over,” he quickly says. The figure does not move nor say a word, ‘weird… normally the guy would have turned around to see who has entered the room by now. Or at least said something,’ the boy thinks to himself. Tyler waits a few more seconds, when the figure still does not move he starts to relax and move his hands away from his privates. Slowly and cautiously, Tyler walks up from behind, “um… hello,” he asks, he carefully pokes the figure on the shoulder, but receives no reaction, “you alive?”<br />
<br />
Jeff hears his door open and panics, knowing that it can only be his brother, ‘damn it,’ he thinks to himself, but he can’t help but chuckles mentally when he hears his brother apologizing when he notices the “person” in the room. He then tenses again when he feels his brother poking him, ‘shit… he’ll realize that I am not a real person… well, not now at least.’<br />
<br />
Tyler waves a hand in front of the person’s eyes, but still receives no reaction, “what the freak,” he says. His curiosity gets the better of him and he turns the chair so that the figure is facing him, Tyler looks closer and his eyes widen, “it’s some kind of doll,” he says, when he realizes that the eyes of the “person” are made of glass and his skin made of soft silicone.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels a tiny hand turn him around and he is shocked to see his little brother in all his naked glory standing right in front of him, staring at him with confusion in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Tyler takes a few steps back to get a better look at the “doll”, “why is it dressed in Jeff’s clothes,” he asks himself, “and why would Jeff even have this?” When his eyes move down to the “Doll’s” crotch, the 12-year-old blushes, “oh… th-that’s why,” he says when he notices the “tent” in the jeans. Tyler looks back up at the Doll and tilts his head, “what kind of “Doll”… “Toy”… are you exactly,” he asks, “some kind of sex doll? Why would Jeff have you? As far as I know, Jeff has a girlfriend. Hmmm… maybe Jeff got you as a gift for her, that would make sense.”<br />
<br />
Jeff, still terrified of what Tyler would do, feels slightly relieved, ‘well… at least he does not assume I am gay… which I am NOT!’<br />
<br />
The more Tyler stares at the “Doll”, unaware that it is his brother Jeff, the more curious he becomes. “I wonder if you weigh like a real human, or like a feather,” the small boy says, he walks over and puts his tiny hands on the hips of the “Doll”. Jeff is surprised, when he finds himself being lifted effortlessly by his brother, who almost falls backwards, not expecting the “Doll” being so light. Tyler giggles, “woah, almost caused me to fall over,” he says, “you are a lot lighter than I have expected. Let’s put you on the bed,” so Tyler walks over to Jeff’s bed and sits the “Doll” on the edge. The boy steps back again and looks thoughtfully at the weird “Doll”, “you kinda look like a Spanish guy, with that brown skin and hair,” he says, “I am kinda curious how you look with out any clothes, I still have no idea why Jeff dressed you in them. I have two explanations, one: he tried to hide you… well… “Junior”, or reason two: he tried to prank me, our parents or his girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Hearing his brother wanting to see how he looked like in the nude, sets Jeff back into a panic, but he is surprised at how smart his brother tries to come up with explanations.<br />
<br />
“Hm… I wonder if your joints are fixed or movable,” Tyler the says, he decides to test it and grabs the right arm of the “Doll” and tries to move it. Tyler is surprised, when he notices that the “Doll’s” body seems to have moving joints, “wow… you already looked expensive before, but now with moving joints…,” he lets out a whistle, “I don’t even want to KNOW how much Jeff has paid for you. Let’s put you into a much more comfortable position.” Tyler then starts to move the “Doll’s” body, straightening the legs and arms, then with one hand on the “Doll’s” chest and one on its lap, pushes it into a lying position. The boy then lies the “Doll” outstretched onto Jeff’s bed and is again amazed by how real the Doll looks, “man… if I wouldn’t know it,” he says, “I would assume some stranger is lying in my brother’s bed, dressed in his clothes.” Tyler tilts his head, he looks between the “Doll” and Jeff’s Laptop, one side of him wants to play a game, the other side wants to know more about the “Doll”. How will he decide?</p>
