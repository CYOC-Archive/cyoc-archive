<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(this episode, I think is the worst I've ever written for this series) <br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish foxes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Never, but never, ever, underestimate your enemy. Djinn who for one reason, or another, <br />
been bonded for any length of time and made to grant the wishes of mundane humans, all <br />
knew the fine art of utterly destroying anyone from the wish of a sandwich to the curing of <br />
the illness of a loved one. How easy it was to utterly abuse and grotesquely twist the crude <br />
languages of man to all mean more or less the same thing 'bring death and/or misery <br />
upon me and/or those I love.' The haughty attitude unbound djinn showed towards <br />
humans was legendary, 'I Dream of Genie' be damned! <br />
<br />
Considering that all of the kitesune slaves and creatures were all at one point human, this <br />
superior attitude had carried over. And left large openings for mistakes. <br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Your majesty!&quot; Lucy had vanished from the city walls in a burst of sand and reappeared in <br />
much the same manner within seconds in Tamthis' throne room, the throne for her King <br />
currently unoccupied. &quot;Your majesty! I've sensed it! The ones we sent out in the name of <br />
peace! They have been attacked! Taken! Amused! By things not our kind or humans!&quot;  <br />
<br />
 &quot;I know.&quot; Her towering wolf/vixen queen replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know?&quot; Lucy asked shocked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are all mine, I sense and feel through all of you,&quot; 'Strange that I can't sense or feel <br />
through Alexandra or my King, no matter, their guardian provides me eyes and ears <br />
enough for them. If only not for the taint infecting my second body, then I could merely <br />
sense her out!' &quot;I sensed through them where they were taken, who had taken them, what <br />
had taken them, through their senses, those of my loyal subjects I sensed it all... then, <br />
another invader cut my connection to them, they are lost to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. But their sacrifice is not in vain, I now know of the existence of this second enemy <br />
besides my second body... and they have violated those moving in the name of peace... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Criminals!&quot; Was the only thing Lucy had to say to that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely. Beware, our enemy is numbered in ten thousand, each one creatures who are -<br />
living- magic, rather than living containers of magic, and those ten thousand are led by <br />
one more who could very well be as powerful as my second body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten... ten THOUSAND?&quot; Lucy felt small. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but I shall converse with our King, I sense in the knowledge he gave me when I <br />
became his queen,&quot; What she took from him, &quot;What these beings are, and I shall ask him <br />
for what strengths and weakness they have. We do not know if they are in league with my <br />
second body or not, but the nature of the one leading the ten thousands suggests they <br />
are! Natalie! Roberta! Your queen in the name of your king calls you!&quot;  Someone else might <br />
have accused the Kitesune Queen of having planned the capturing of her own 'citizens', <br />
but she was far too mad to conceived such a thing. <br />
<br />
The Alpha Natalie wolf beast, and the Shiva Vixen soon enough joined Lucy in front of <br />
their queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Redirect all resources at once! Fortify the city! Arm our citizens! Rally the troops! Prepare <br />
our defenses and weapons! We! Are at war!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Janice however, had one last thing to say, &quot;And if you didn't really want any of them to <br />
become angels, why did you offer the option in the first place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me answer your question WITH a question: if God didn't want Adam and Eve to eat <br />
from the Tree of Knowledge Of Good And Evil, why did he place it in the Garden to begin <br />
with?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Part of the Great Plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, so that even in a perfect paradise like the Garden, there would still be a choice. If I <br />
pretended that option didn't exist, I'd be no different from the illusionists who want to <br />
keep up the veil that the so-called 'super natural' doesn't exist. And I noticed you didn't <br />
ask why, if I secretly wanted them all to become Angels, then why did I even offer the <br />
option of them becoming true kitesune?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess I didn't really give it much thought. ... By the way, if Jasim is the species as you <br />
and my sisters, why is he working with genies anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Djinn and Angels are cousins of sorts.&quot;  <br />
<br />
That was when they both heard it. In Jasim's voice.  In their minds.<br />
<br />
'Attention Tabra and his spirit double. You are invited to witness the interrogation of <br />
slaves of the kitesune prince who my loyal djinn have freed. Weather you come or not is <br />
your own business.'<br />
<br />
Tabra thought for a minute, &quot;We better get Julio to have them warm up while we're gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think it's a trap? I'm surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasim at the end of the day is still a loyalist, not a devil. He's too -honest- to do <br />
something like that. Heh. If I had ten thousand buddies with me I wouldn't be as scared at <br />
making broadcasts over open radio either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose we need to get Julio to get the girls awake and what not before we go right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
When Tabra/Janice appeared at what was apparently Jasim's base of operations. Janice had <br />
expected something grand and otherworldly, but seemed to be much a safe haven as <br />
Tabra's was. Only there were.... GENIES! Everywhere! Janice had never seen one outside of <br />
TV but knew exactly what they were! Their aura alone that she saw with their body's <br />
second sight spoke volumes of them. These beings -were- power. But at the same time... <br />
Janice had the strange image pop into her head at being at a powder cake convention. <br />
<br />
When a smaller genie floated along and said was their guide, Janice couldn't help but <br />
noticing the... condescending attitude they held towards them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You took them into your base of operations, THEN de-brainwashed them?&quot; Tabra <br />
confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Jasim said wondering what the idiot was going on about now. <br />
<br />
Tabra stared at Jasim for several seconds before shouting, &quot;You idiot~!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You dare-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! For once in your life SHUT UP! You just -handed- Tamthis every single thing <br />
these people saw and heard before you broke their brainwashing! You've lost your element <br />
of surprise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you babbling about now you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tamthis can see, and hear, everything her creations do! She can't focus on all of them at <br />
once, but I think she'd focus on some of her creations getting rescued from her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you even know -any- of this your fraud?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice jabbed their own temple with their fingers,   &quot;-WE- were inside her head! We <br />
-were- her for a short time when we turned us into a copy of her! If Tabra hadn't done <br />
what she had we'd -still- be her! Her power comes from having absorbed Karther's castle! <br />
That means anything she transforms has a small part of it made like her! Meaning she can <br />
sense and feel through them like -any- body part!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;BAW!&quot; abu Haj boomed, &quot;The kitesune and his abominations will tremble in -fear- when <br />
they learn an -army- of dijinn is about to descend upon them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice looked at the djinn, &quot;You think -rational- and logical fear applies to someone <br />
whose completely lost in conflicting essences, conflicting magics, and several layers of <br />
conflicting brainwashing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You jest, the kitesune is a coward,&quot; Abu Haj objected, &quot;Why else would he have his slaves <br />
carry a white flag when outside his stolen land?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice said together, &quot;Oh no you didn't!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What of it?&quot; abu Haj asked annoyed at this Nazarene. <br />
<br />
&quot;.....You have to ask? It might not be anything in of itself, but you've opened a -lot- of <br />
dangerous doors! Tell me, did you try to speak to Tamthis' victims before rescuing them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AGH! Cause that's what a white flag is for!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not need to answer or explain myself to you Nazarene!&quot; <br />
<br />
'A what?' Janice asked.<br />
<br />
'Judo-Christian.' <br />
<br />
'Oh.'<br />
<br />
&quot;You technically committed a war crime! Yes! Under most laws of common sense it won't <br />
hold up -but- that doesn't mean Tamthis can't use it to her advantage somehow! Taking <br />
advantage of a situation is what kitesune do! Even a mad one.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There's any other kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are degrees of insanity, some constructive, some not.&quot; <br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
At the interrogation, more like a debriefing with Tamthis' victims now having their own <br />
minds, one thing that surprised and confused Jasim to no end, was how kitesune prince <br />
was apparently now king, had no harem, made no public appearance (impossible for such <br />
a grandstander) and this 'Tamthis' queen or something or other, apparently was trying to <br />
get their fake little kingdom to function as a genuine society, baw! It would be gone soon <br />
enough! <br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice were alarmed and concerned as they managed to learn the fate of their <br />
two lost sisters, yes, it seemed they would have to fight them to save them and Tammie as <br />
well. <br />
<br />
'HUH?' Jasim had stood there stupified when Tabra had APOLOGIZED to the family for this <br />
happening to them. Of course it was the Nazarene's fault totally and utterly, but he was <br />
actually APOLOGIZING for something? The fact Tabra regularly apologized for his mistakes <br />
when they occurred did not occur to Jasim in the slightest. <br />
<br />
T could only exist as an immature, ineffective, vain, cowardly, proud, selfish creature in his <br />
mind, anything else he quickly wave handed as being due to his spiritual double. <br />
<br />
&quot;You and your Project return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Our- project return Jasim, all divinities, all divine powers agreed to this, with only one <br />
vote being enough to stone wall it all... Jasim, people are SICK of having to hide their own <br />
nature like criminals.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Back at their safe house, Julio putting the girls through what would be their last -normal- <br />
training session, Janice said, &quot;Well.&quot; Their body smirked and swayed, &quot;We do have one <br />
added advantage now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra moaned, &quot;And what, precisely, would that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice laughed, so much at stake, and she was able to laugh. 'They're expecting us to <br />
show up with a very visible and very large army of ten thousand beings with enough power <br />
to make even a dime store magic meter break right?... They're not expecting a MUCH <br />
smaller group of five angels to sneak in. And even if they spot us... they'll be get up in <br />
arms looking around for the REST of 'our army' right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra thought for a minute, &quot;You have a point, and they'll figure on us attacking with the <br />
rest of the force, so they'll won't be putting as much effort trying to sense us on our own. <br />
No many notice bugs when you're on the look out for a herd of grizzly bears. But being <br />
able to outfox the Queen of Kitesune, won't be a game, and we only have a day to plan it.&quot; <br />
<br />
They smelled it, the sent of leafs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then maybe,&quot; A neither male nor female voice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You need two foxes,&quot; Another neither male nor female voice added. <br />
<br />
&quot;To out fox,&quot; The first one added.<br />
<br />
Then together, &quot;The big fox!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice recognized their auras even before they even made themselves visible from a <br />
swirl of leaves. They were too familiar not to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna! Keiko!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it's Akira right now,&quot; Said one of five tailed foxes. <br />
<br />
Janice wondered, &quot;What are you DOING here? I thought you guys wanted -out- of -all- of <br />
this? How'd you get in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko, showing herself being more aloof then Janice had ever remembered, waved her tails <br />
back and forth, a slight glint in her eyes, &quot;We let ourselves in.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think this place considers us on the guest list.&quot; Akira/Anna said. The two kitesune <br />
circled the angelic fox, always moving their legs and tails. <br />
<br />
Keiko, &quot;As for why we're here, if we're really kitesune now, that makes Karther our <br />
responsibility too right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And meh I thought,&quot; Anna/Akira said, &quot;It'll make a good coming out party for us too. <br />
Besides, who better for you to prepare to gate crash a trickster's house, than a -pair- of <br />
tricksters?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice wanted to say, &quot;You two guys aren't tricksters.&quot; But she saw the look in her sisters' <br />
eyes. It was not tainted with carnal desire like Karther, or delusion like Tamthis, but she <br />
saw it. That slight glint in their eyes, that mark of slight insanity that all kitesune had.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back home little sisters.&quot; Janice finally gushed and hugged the two five tailed <br />
foxes. <br />
<br />
They say that in war, one must get inside the head of your opposition, think as the enemy <br />
thinks. And Tabra knew a very true statement. Only a kitesune, could think like a kitesune.</p>
