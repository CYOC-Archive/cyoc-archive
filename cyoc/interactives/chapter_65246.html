<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alex,&quot; the voice of my sister drove its way into my head and looking about, I saw that I was back in my bedroom and figuring that all that had happened before must have been some form of seizure or that I fell asleep sitting at my desk, I nearly screamed when my sister said, &quot;Why aren't you ready yet? Jeremy is going to be here in the next ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning my full attention to Erin, who was standing the door to my room, I was about to ask who this Jeremy happened to be, but before I could say anything, she walked in and picked up something off my bed that looked like a dress and told me, &quot;Don't worry. I know that you are a little shy around boys and that you normally don't wear such clothes, but you'll be fine. And as long as you remember what mother taught us about control, you shouldn't have any unpleasent transformations,&quot; and handing me the dress, she asked, &quot;Do you want to borrow anything from me? Jewelry? A matching purse? Stockings or hose?&quot;<br />
<br />
As I shook my head and took the offered garment, I wondered what she was talking about and why she was treating me suddenly like a girl when I clearly knew that I was a boy and as I looked down, taking in the towel wrapped around my torso just below my armpits, I barely heard Erin tell me, &quot;Well, if you need anything, just hollar,&quot; as she left, closing the door behind her, I wondered what the heck was going on.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
My foot and leg raised up behind me, I tug on the shoe, which just barely fits my foot and placing my foot on the floor, I listen as my stepmother called out, &quot;Alex. Your date is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning toward the full body mirror I peer at my reflection, taking in that I looked about sixteen, as I knew my age to be, noted that my chest was flat and lifting up the front of the dress, I shifted the underwear and pantyhose until I could see that my penis and testicles where clearly tucked back between my legs. Dropping the hem of the dress, which fell to just about my knees, I took in the white fabric, how it was strapless, wondered how it was held up and let my gaze fall to the hose I was wearing, sheer in appearance, but dark enough to cover up my legs, which I suspected had a fair bit of leg hairs.<br />
<br />
As I looked down at my feet, I thought that they looked off somehow, but before I could fully come to how they appeared differant and why my feet no longer really felt pinched, a voice behind me said, &quot;You look beautiful, Alex,&quot; and turning around, I found myself looking at a young man of about sixteen years of age wearing a black suit.<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling shy an awckward, I gaze down in a shy manner and mumble, &quot;Thank you,&quot; as the boy grins in a sheepish manner and after a couple seconds, he tells me, &quot;I got this for you,&quot; and looking up, I watch as he opens a small box and withdraws a corsage, which I offer my wrist for him to slip it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we?&quot; he asked as he held out his arm and the feeling of being shy increased exponentially as I took the offered arm and allowed myself to be led out of the room.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
A slow song plays and around me I feel other bodies pressing almost up against me. But this does not really bother me as I lean against Jeremy, allowing him to lead in the dance, my mind on other things as well as the high school dance.<br />
<br />
There was quite a load of stuff I do not fully understand. Like how I got here, how I got dressed up and why nobody was saying anything about the fact that I was clearly a boy dressed in a girl's dress. I did not understand why my feet had shrunk, for that was what had happened and why they no longer felt pinched. I did not understand how it was that Jeremy had grown taller over the past couple hours or that I had clearly shrunk. Nor did I understand how it was that my hair had grown in length, taking up a bun-like feature on top of my head, or that skin had shifted somehow and was now smoother and softer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything all right?&quot; Jeremy asked, breaking into my thoughts and looking up at him, I nodded and answered, &quot;Mmm, hmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling, he closer and kissed my forhead and whispered, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; I answered back as I leaned closer and pressed my body against his, liking the warmth that it was generating.<br />
<br />
After a couple more minutes, the song ended and Jeremy asked, &quot;Can we go somewhere to talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, I felt myself being led off the dance floor and when we had reached a fairly secluded spot, Jeremy said, &quot;We have been dating for a bit and I was wondering something. I was wondering if you wanted to try to take out relationship to the next level. I mean. I ma comfortable if you say no, but still...&quot; stuttering and faltering at certain points until he finally just lapsed into silence, looking first at me and then away.<br />
<br />
I thought about what he had just said and what it was obviously being implied and thinking that something felt off, I thought about it for a couple seconds and then leaned forward to whiper...<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jeremy was kissing my, his tongue slapping against my lips, searching for the proper opening before he was finally able to get it into my mouth. I felt his hand grasping at my flat chest and his penis pressed up against me and for a second I thought that this was all wrong and that we should just stop.<br />
<br />
Instead, I let out a moan of pleasure and reaching out, I began unbutton Jeremy's shirt, returning his fumbling kiss as he groped in back for a zipper to my dress. Pushing away from him, I took in the room we were in, the mat we were lying on all in a matter of three seconds and pushing Jeremy down so that he was lying on the mat, I whispered coyly, &quot;Does Peter want to come out and play,&quot; as I shifted about and pushed off my pantyhose, underwear and tossed them over onto my shoes.<br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned up at me and replied, &quot;Yes. But he has to put on his special hat,&quot; and leaning down to kiss him, I told him, &quot;You do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jeremy returned my kiss, I reached up under my right armpit and gently pulled on the hidden zipper and feeling my dress loosening, I shifted so that it was riding higher, my penis and testicles suddenly exposed, where upon I almost stopped making love to the boy before me, but found myself caught up even more in the throughs of passion as he placed both his hands on my chest and began to gently squeeze.<br />
<br />
Moaning, I began to gyrate my body, rubbing the area between my legs against Jeremy's pants, feeling his penis getting harder within the fabric. As I did this, Jeremy continued to massage my chest, which had started to grow from a flat chest to breast buds to an A cup and out before finally stopping at a C cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment,&quot; Jeremy whispered to me and as I leaned down to press myself against him, he started to undo his pants, paused, twisted until he was in a sitting position with me wrapping my legs around his abdomen and moving about, he pushed off his pants and boxers, reached in the pants pocket for the condom before tossing them aside and leaning in to kiss me, he began to fidgit about, sliding the piece of protection over his erect penis.<br />
<br />
Looking down, seeing my own penis and testicles just past my pert chest, I let my gaze fall past my own genitalia as I took in his erect member and leaning to start kissing him again, I whispered, &quot;Peter came out to play. And he has his special hat on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy returned my kisses as he leaned forward, forcing me to lie back onto my back and rubbing his genitals against mine, I let out another moan of pleaure, unaware that my own genitals had begun to transform. And then I felt a slight pinch as Jeremy pressed his penis into my vagina and for a moment I thought that something was definity wrong, but then Jeremy started to push and gyrating to match his movements, I lost the thought once again.<br />
&quot;Alex,&quot; the voice of my sister drove its way into my head and looking about, I saw that I was back in my bedroom and figuring that all that had happened before must have been some form of seizure or that I fell asleep sitting at my desk, I nearly screamed when my sister said, &quot;Why aren't you ready yet?

I know that you are a little shy around boys and that you normally don't wear such clothes, but you'll be fine. And as long as you remember what mother taught us about control, you shouldn't have any unpleasant transformations,&quot; and handing me the dress, she asked, &quot;Do you want to borrow anything from me? Jewelry? A matching purse? Stockings or hose?&quot;<br />
<br />
As I shook my head and took the offered garment, I wondered what she was talking about and why she was treating me suddenly like a girl when I clearly knew that I was a boy and as I looked down, taking in the towel wrapped around my torso just below my armpits, I barely heard Erin tell me, &quot;Well, if you need anything, just holler,&quot; as she left, closing the door behind her, I wondered what the heck was going on.<br />

<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; I answered back as I leaned closer and pressed my body against his, liking the warmth that it was generating.<br />

<br />

-----<br />
<br />
&quot;Play with me,&quot; the voice of Tanya called out and blinking, understanding that I was lying on my bed, thinking about what had happened the night before with Jeremy, I find myself confused as I sat up and looked down, taking in the white Lycra-spandex stretch pants I am wearing and the white t-shirt that was stretched tightly across my chest.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;This isn't right,&quot; but unsure how it was supposed to be right, I once again hear Tanya's voice telling me, &quot;Come play with me. You said that you would,&quot; and looking in the direction where he voice is coming from, I see her standing in my doorway, wearing one of her one-piece underwear and nothing else, twirling about in place, looking at me as if she expected something.<br />
<br />
After a couple seconds, I stand and asked her, &quot;What do you want to play?&quot; as I caught sight of my reflection in the full body mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dress up,&quot; Tanya immediately replied and turning my attention away from the sixteen year old girl reflected back, I gazed at Tanya and said, &quot;I haven't played dress up in years and I don't have anything to wear for dress up,&quot; finding that I was speaking automatically without really giving any thought to what I was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wear something of mine,&quot; my half-sister said.<br />
<br />
Blinking, I smiled and explained, &quot;I do not really think anything that you have would fit me. Are you sure that there isn't something else you want to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya shook her head and replied, &quot;Dress up,&quot; and reaching out to take my hand, she commented, &quot;Don't worry. What I have will fit,&quot; as she led me from my room, down the hallway and into her room, where she handed me a doll and told me in a no-nonsense sort of voice, &quot;This is your baby. Her name is Gina.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I accepted the doll, Tanya went to her closet and going through the contents within, she took out another onesie, this one with a bit of fabric sewn around the waist so that is looked like a one piece dress. Handing me the garment, she explained, &quot;You can wear this,&quot; and taking the offered garment, I saw that it had two snaps between the legs.<br />
<br />
Not giving it a second thought, I reached down to the hem of my shirt and pulled it up and over my head, exposing my breasts to my younger sister, who was no longer paying attention to me as she went through her closet for something else. Undoing the snaps, I pulled the garment on over my head, adjusted my breasts and pushing down on my pants, I gently pulled down on the onesie dress until I was able to get the snaps to fasten between my legs.<br />
<br />
Kicking off my pants, feeling rather silly wearing something that was clearly several sizes to small, I turned to Tanya and asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya, who was pulling on one of her fairy costumes, nodded and told that I looked pretty and inviting me to sit down, she picked up a pair of tights and began to pull them on. Sitting, I asked, &quot;Do I get any tights,&quot; as I shifted my legs so that they were curled up almost to the point that I was sitting on them.<br />
<br />
In response, Tanya handed me a pair of tights and as I slipped them on, I noted that for some reason the outfit that was originally stretched tight over my body no longer felt as tight as before. But before I had time to dwell on this, Tanya handed me once again the doll and said, &quot;She needs her mommy,&quot; and as I cradled the thing close to me, failing to notice that my chest had flattened out, I listened as my sister asked, &quot;Tea, ladies?&quot; thinking for some reason that everything looked bigger.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
With a gasp, I sat up, the odd dream driven violently away as I gazed wildly about, trying to figure out where I was and what was real and what wasn't. Seeing that I was lying in an abandoned shop, the events of the previous night and unknown amount of time passage flitted through my mind as I gazed down. What I see nearly caused me to wail out in alarm, but before I could I heard something moving close by and tensing, ignoring my current appearance, I started to scan the vacant shop, understanding that there was someone else in the room with me and that they too had just woken up, wondering if this was something new or if it had anything to do with my sister Erin and her friend Beatrice.</p>
