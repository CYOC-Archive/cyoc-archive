<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For whatever reason tonight, Andy just was not feeling all that hungry. Lucy was as usual being icy and distant over the whole issue yet again, even her worry seemed to be momentary and barely last. And she just as well had a rather nasty smell to her. Andy didn&#39;t know when his sense of smell became quite so attuned, but he guessed it was a new gift of some sort. None of the food was really appealing to him right now. He didn&#39;t even know what it was, just that it didn&#39;t smell so good.<br />
<br />
As he walked out, Andy was hit by the heat one more time. Even the evening was pretty hot out...<br />
<br />
As Andy excused himself to go out and &quot;cool off and lay down for a while&quot;, he took off his shirt again and groaned. The heat was really something else out here, but he guessed it was to be expected what with Africa. Maybe they&#39;d just let him keep his shirt off, walk around like this as he wanted. He then found himself thinking about Mitch, the well toned young blond man and how he&#39;d responded to him.<br />
<br />
Andy crossed his arms, Lucy was hardly the first girl he&#39;d ever gone out with or had sex with. He&#39;d never so much as entertained the idea of indulging with a guy before. Then he remembered how Lucy was acting, and hey, maybe it would be a good break or something from the way things were right now. He knew he shouldn&#39;t be thinking about cheating on Lucy, let alone with a guy of all people, but it wasn&#39;t like fooling around with one guy would turn him gay or anything.<br />
<br />
He looked back at the dinner tent, and crossed his arms. He looked down at them for a moment and mused that this much hair coming in on him was really weird. And his body had never been this outstandingly fit before. Andy knew he should be at least a little alarmed about this, but one flex of his bicep cleared that worry away from him posthaste.<br />
<br />
When he looked back up, Andy&#39;s eyes were drawn to something standing just a while outside of the tent circle. A singular grazing gazelle just...standing there within his sight. Grazing on some small amount of flora growing out of the desolate earth. Andy&#39;s eyes widened a bit, and he licked his lips. For some reason he was thinking things about this gazelle, salivating in anticipation of eating it somehow. He shook his head in time to see it run off into the dusk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, what the hell is wrong with me?&quot; Andy asked himself as he headed back into his tent to go lay down and try and cool his nerves. Fuck, he thought as he looked down at his groin, I&#39;m fucking horny. On top of everything else going on here.<br />
<br />
Thankfully he could take care of himself in all likelihood. It seemed Lucy was more into talking and engaging with the other travelers here as opposed to going back and seeing anything to do with him. Andy guessed he could probably get away with taking care of himself out here. He damn well needed it.<br />
<br />
As Andy entered his tent and laid down on the sleeping bag, he quickly threw his shirt held in one hand to the side, followed by kicking off his track pants. As he pulled down his boxers for some momentary relief from his needs, Andy squinted a bit. His manhood looked a little bit...off in some way. He couldn&#39;t tell how. But eh, his cock still looked like it was gonna function. Wrapping a hand around it and choking down a moan, Andy set to work.<br />
<br />
He was pretty astonished by the degree of sensitivity there, but he guessed it was not that surprising. He was feeling pretty wound up today.<br />
<br />
As Andy continued his self pleasure, he would not even notice Mitch walking over to the tent, partly opening the zipper, and holding back a gasp at what he was seeing. Mitch leaned back and thought about what he was going to do from here. The guy he was crushing on was right there in the tent, having apparently the time of his life just going to town like that. But then, Mitch also knew he himself had a girlfriend who was gonna come back tonight from a supply run. But he really fucking wanted Andy...</p>
