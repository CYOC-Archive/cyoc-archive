<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upstairs in the Gustav manor, Bowen was sitting on the bed of his girlfriend Cherry. She had gone into the shower only a little while ago, but he was already impatient for her to get out. Shooting out a couple of texts to his gaming bros had only killed a little bit of time, and only made his boner for his bitchy girl harder to ignore...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up, Cherry babe! I ain&#39;t got long tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
However, unbeknownst to the brash Bowen, the person who heard his words wasn&#39;t Cherry. Well, for the moment anyway...<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
About fifteen minutes earlier, the Italian-American woman had pulled off and tossed aside her clothes before hopping into the shower. Letting the hot water pour down over her head, she thought about the willpower it had taken to keep from jumping her brute of a boyfriend&#39;s bones on the ride back from school. But the two of them rutting in the back seat of her daddy&#39;s limo would&#39;ve raised more than just eyebrows. <br />
<br />
She knew Daddy wouldn&#39;t approve of her brash Bow, especially if the Step-Monster was about. He wanted her to find a nice &quot;respectable boy&quot;. She almost gagged. If she wanted that, she wouldn&#39;t have dumped Darren Wong!<br />
<br />
Returning her attention to getting cleaned up, Cherry started to lose herself in the steam, relaxing greatly. Unseen by her, her long dark brown hair was beginning to recede upwards, lightening with each inch it lost. It was a sandy blonde when it finally settled just under a chin that was starting to fill out more rounder. <br />
<br />
Elsewhere, her ample breasts dropped down from c-cups on the verge of d&#39;s to much more modest b-cups. Her well-toned and round butt went from a peach to a pear as well, As water and soap bubbles flowed down the drain, so too did her tanned olive skin, leaving behind a slightly pasty complexion. <br />
<br />
She almost stumbled out of the shower, as her feet grew bigger and she dropped about four inches in height. Groping for a towel and pulling over her head to try her hair, a now fading Cherry didn&#39;t see her perfect smile get hidden behind corrective braces. Nor did she see her designer sunglasses become regular glasses with a black horn-rimmed frame and thick lens. <br />
<br />
An now unmanicured hand reached out, wiping steam from the mirror over the sink. Sherry Grace  blinked at the blurry image she saw before pulling on her glasses. Her now green eyes widened in shock, as she didn&#39;t recoginze where she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get from school to here? I remember that homophobic bully Criss was yelling at me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, she heard a boy yell for someone named Cherry to hurry up! The nerdy lesbian panicked slightly not sure who he was referring to. This was compounded by the fact she was WET AND NAKED TOO! <br />
<br />
Wrapping the towel around herself, she looked frantically for some sort of clothes to put on but none of the stuff on the floor could possibly fit her. Especially those hip-hugger jeans, which probably would&#39;ve split if she pulled them on.<br />
<br />
Outside, the boy had gone quiet. Sherry breathed a sigh of relief. At least, that was one problem off the list. But there was still one glaring issue. She still couldn&#39;t figure out how she&#39;d gotten here!<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Unknown to Sherry, the boy yelled earlier was also beginning to revert from his brash self back to his much shyer drama club self. But that&#39;s for later, let&#39;s get back to the bathroom....<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Sherry sat down on the toliet, her brow furrowed in throught. She just couldn&#39;t crack the puzzle of her transposition from the school to wherever here was. Sighing, she took another look around the room, and her gaze fell upon a frame photo hanging over her current position.<br />
<br />
It was obviously some sort of glamour shot, as the girl in the picture look really pretty,  Like she knew she was damn sexy and flaunted it. The more Sherry looked at the image, the more it drew her in, and caused a flush of lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a knockout, but something about the smirk says she&#39;s a real....BITCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
She clapped a hand over her mouth, wondering where that had come from. It wasn&#39;t a word in her regular vocabulary. However, she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it for too much longer, as she&#39;d retriggered the &#39;were-breeder&quot; curse Criss had passed to her... <br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
In the main hall of the Gustav manor, there was a two framed photo portraits hanging over the door leading to Don Gustav&#39;s study. He was present in both of them, but his companion was different in each, One was with his precious daughter Cherry, and the other with his darling wife, Caterina.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never been able to get them to agree to take one as a whole family, which always disappointed him. But now the curse was warping reality to draw the two of them closer to one another. No longer were they going to stepdaughter and stepmother. Now they were actually made mother and child by blood<br />
<br />
With a cracking of glass and a splintering of wood, the two portraits merged into one. Now three figures stood together, smiling. Don Gustav, his wife and their daughter.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Something deep inside had made Sherry get up and look into the mirror again. She gasped slightly as her short hair was growing longer. It flowed past her shoulders, reaching down to the center of her back. It was darkening as well, with a rich brown flowing out from the roots until only the tips remained blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;W..w..what is happpening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, her vison grew blurry, as her eyes corrected themselves to perfect 20/20 vision. Confused, the nerdette leaned over to grab the sink for support. There was a flush of heat from her ass, as it began to remould back into a perfect heart-shape of lusciousness. A crack from the small of her back forced Sherry forward, sending her glasses into the sink.<br />
<br />
Looking up, she could see her face was different now. Her braces were gone and the brilliant white smile they&#39;d been trying to achieve since middle school was there! Unconsciously, she smirked at her reflection, her lips already plumping up. Her pasty complexion was also gone, as the skin had taken on a lovely olive-hued tan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...I look fucking great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, a unfamiliar curse word came out of her mouth, but this time, it felt right. LIke it was one of her favorite words to say. And there were others starting bubble up in her mind, crowding out some of her intellect, and a lot of her attraction to women. Thankfully, it was replaced with a healthy admiration of the male form.<br />
<br />
As if in response to this rising attraction to guys, her chest started to expand, pushing aside the towel wrapped around her torso. More of that lovely tan flowed over her new d-cups. The girls were looking extra perky today, and the bounce they gave as she stretched her thin and toned arms brought another smirk to her now cherry red lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cherry? My fave color!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn away from the mirror, she bent over to pick up her fallen towel, and looked pleased at the view of her long toned legs and her thick thighs. Rising back up to stand at her full height of 5&#39; 10&quot;, she ran her hands through her still damp hair, fluffing it out to let her blonde tips show. She raised a perfectly manicured red fingernail to her lips thoughtfully<br />
<br />
&quot;So glad I got Momma&#39;s hair instead of Daddy&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words seemed to spark something inside her head.. This rush of new memories washed out the last bits of a lesbian nerd from her mind. It also erased a previously held animosity towards a certain Russian queen.<br />
<br />
After all, how could Cherry ever resent her mother! She was her role model! She&#39;d learned all the tricks and tactics that had put her on top of the social ladder at school from her MaMa. Not mention how to speak Russian. Of course, she&#39;s learned Italian just like Daddy wanted to.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
On that same wall in the hall, more pictures of the family had appeared,  one showing a young Cherry in the arms of her natural mother Caterina. Likewise, there was now a healthy mix of Russsian objects d&#39;art sprinkled through out the manor, as Caterina had always been the lady of the house. <br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Cherry fussed some more in the mirror until she was satisfied. Picking up her discarded clothes, she didn&#39;t even register that her hip-hugger jeans had become a black skirt that rested dangerously above her knees.<br />
<br />
Nor did she care that her crop-top had become a silky red blouse. She did remember to unbutton her top two buttons to let her cleavage breathe before bending down to pick up her black pumps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m ready for some fun with my man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chernislava &#39;Cherry&#39; Gustav, the Russo-Italian mafia princess, opened the door leading back into her bedroom...</p>
