<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Brenda walks out the door, you survey an empty store. The boredom is quickly broken as within about 15 minutes it goes from zero to 5 people roaming the aisles, browsing. You spend time answering any questions or checkout, but mostly staying out of the way of the customers. Time flies as Brenda walks in with the bags from drive through. Your glad she didn't go inside. A few customers go out of their way to get a close up look at Brenda's package, but continue to keep to their shopping. You take turns, although you eat lightly, as you would rather have what Brenda makes. The afternoon is uneventful, and you find yourself asking if each and every customer is the next one. You go out of your way to brush up against them as they walk the aisles. As the clock nears 7pm, and it nears darkness, Brenda looks over to you, &quot;Your still here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, &quot;So far. It's not closing yet. You just jinxed it for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Brenda is about to speak, the bell on the door jingles, and you both turn around to see a man and woman, and recognize the man as the older gentleman from this morning. Brenda waves, &quot;Hello again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the couple approach the counter, the man smiles and takes a breath, &quot;First off, from both of us, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man's wife nods, &quot;Yes, thank you&quot; she adds.<br />
<br />
The man continues, &quot;Um, I don't want to sound ungrateful, but there is an issue I hope you can help us with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man's wife takes a few steps back so she is in full view of the two behind the counter and pulls up her skirt. Underneath, is a near identical copy of Brenda's ball sac, and a foot long, bulbous, vein riddled cock. Even more striking is the jet black neoprene chaps she is wearing.<br />
<br />
The man points to the cock, &quot;Ummm, that's a bit bigger than I figured.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman lets her skirt down, and Brenda walks over to the door to put in the CLOSED sign and lock the door.<br />
<br />
You look longingly at the model of perfection that is the object of your innermost desire nestled between Mrs. Spencers legs, slowly, you start out, &quot;Congratulations, Mrs?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman says, &quot;Spencer, Margaret Spencer. And this is my husband Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and continue, &quot;Mrs. Spencer, you really love your husband. This would not have happened if both of you did not want to satisfy the other both physically and emotionally. Your size is relative to your husband's physical desire as well as his own carnal desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer looks at his wife with a &quot;I had no idea&quot; look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not his fault Mrs. Spencer&quot;, you add, &quot;It was all a function of you being receptive to your husbands carnal, subconscious desires. His is quite a desperate anal pleasure addict.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know about that,&quot; sighs the older mid-fifties looking woman with graying auburn hair. &quot;But does it have to be so big? My thighs rub against this huge scrotum, keeping this enormous shaft constantly hard.&quot; she asks, then continues, &quot;and I am constantly looking at him, wanting to fill his waiting hole while he does the same to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer walks over to his wife, and puts his arm around her shoulder, which she pushes away.<br />
<br />
Brenda speaks up, &quot;There is something you probably didn't notice when you walked in.&quot; Brenda points down to her own male equipment.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer, &quot;See, that's smaller. I could manage that better than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wave to Brenda, as you use hand motions to signal for her to step back and just watch. &quot;Mr. Spencer, drop your pants please.&quot; Mrs. Spencer watches as her husband pulls down his own pants, showing off his original package with his legs still encased in the silver lycra chaps. &quot;If your wife has a smaller cock, with you be less attracted to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer looks at his wife, but does not answer. You look to Mrs. Spencer, &quot;How about your husband being the same size as you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer doesn't expect that question and is slow to respond, &quot;Just a minute....you say you can make us both the same size?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head and say &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer walks over to her husband and the two whisper to each other. You are happy to see this, as they are still communicating. The two shake and nod as they take turns whispering. Finally, Mr. Spencer speaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife is very much attracted to me. More than she has since we met probably. I don't want to ruin that, as I am more attracted to her than ever before. Please consider my wife's idea, as I agree.&quot; states a husband who is willing to do whatever it takes to make things work.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer looks to you, and with a deep breath slowly states, &quot;I felt a bit left out as I didn't have a say in what happened here. I want to be able to control my husbands outward gender appearance, and to make modifications to his form I may want. Is that possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at Mrs. Spencer, &quot;Well, kind of. What I can do is when you explain your ideal form to your husband, his body will react to your words, based on his interpretation that you can guide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer nods approvingly, &quot;Ok, and I want my husband to be able to do the same to me. Thank you for the spandex fetish, I have been trying to get my husband into it for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't do that, he did that of his own free will.&quot; you respond.<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer, &quot;The way these chaps right so high into my thighs, I feel them slip and slide into my camel toe from time to time, it's great. And the hairless groin helps too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't remember giving Mr. Spencer a hairless groin, but that was probably something your subconscious threw in. &quot;Now that your hear Mrs. Spencer, how monogamous should you and your husband be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer starts to speak but stops and thinks for a  moment, and with some hesitation adds, &quot;Jack and I have  had an open relationship for years. He frequented gay clubs for his pleasure. I was grateful to get the kids we have, but I have not been as able has my husband to find a constant ability to fill my empty void between my legs. If this works, we will each desire each other, and have no need for each other. But I also know my husband, and while we may both have male and female sex organs, I want our vaginas, if we have them, to be exclusive to the two of us. I don't want to raise any one else's kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer was losing a fight to hold back the tears as his wife spoke. He wraps his arms around her and just hugged her tightly.<br />
<br />
You walk over to the tightly embraced couple and whisper, &quot;Continue holding each other until I say it is done.&quot; You get down on your knees and with one hand, you reach between Mr. Spencer's legs and with another you reach between Mrs. Spencer's.  You slowly work both of your fists into the two identical vaginas. You begin to work them into a female orgasm as you picture in your mind the changes Mrs. Spencer requested. While not mind readers, they will respond to the other's words. You also give Mr. Spencer the suggestion that his body is incredible, and that form fitting clothes are the best way to show it off to his wife. You also modify their vaginas to lube with a special fluid, that they both share, and this lube will become a strong acid and cause great harm and damage to the offending penis. As you feel both bodies spasm with each side to side twist, you slowly work your fists out, letting them down slowly from another of their shared orgasms. You stand and give both a pat on the shoulder with your vaginal fluid coated latex hands. &quot;It is done&quot; you explain.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer whispers into her husband's ear. Almost immediately Mr. Spencer is becoming softer in his male features, as his hair is growing. His chest and abdomen are also changing shape. Mr. Spencer takes off his shirt as his nipples are huge and look like cock heads. Mrs. Spencer smiles as she watches her husband become a splitting image of herself at age 20 with huge DD breasts and a foot long cock and full ball sac to match her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Spencer, step over here, and look into the mirror if you like.&quot; you offer.<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer does not move, &quot;It does not matter what I look like, It makes my wife happy and that is all I want, just as her body is filling my head with the urge to leap on her and impale myself on her magnificent member.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look to Mrs. Spencer, who is in tears, &quot;Mrs. Spencer, are you happy, and can you make this work. You both have a lot of responsibility. Your power over each other can be a sadistic road to ruin just as it can be an enlightened path to everlasting happiness. You are in each other's hands now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer reaches up and cups each breast in his hands and gives a gentle rub of the mushroom shaped nipple, which sends a jump start to make his rock hard cock throb. He turns to Brenda, &quot;Got a crotchless bodysuit, black, very shiny, with some help for my breasts?<br />
<br />
Brenda goes over to a rack, thumbs through and returns with a shiny wet look black lycra bodysuit with a crotch zipper and a modified upper torso that will encase her breasts in their own spandex pouch, and zipper access to the nipples.<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer removes the rest of his loose clothing at his ankles and the silver chaps, then walks over to Brenda, takes the suit, and slips into it right there. Mrs. Spencer comes over to you and points to Brenda's feet, and wants two sets of the red latex booties similar to hers. You head over to an display of footwear, and return with 2 boxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try them on first,&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer hands a box to her husband who opens the box, takes the booties out, dropping the box to the floor as he attempts to slide the tight, stretchy latex shells around his feet.<br />
<br />
Brenda laughs, and goes around behind the counter and returns with her bottle of latex lube lotion. Brenda puts the lotion back on the counter after giving all four booties a couple of squirts of the lube. Both Spencers are twisting their bodies as they get used to feeling their feet slide around in the tight latex.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two need to pay and get home. You have a lot of sex ahead of you. You probably should call in sick at work tomorrow and just spend the entire day screwing like rabbits. And remember, don't withhold sex from the other. It's like a drug and it's yours to unselfishly share with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Spencer reaches into her purse and puts her credit card on the counter, while Brenda walks back around to complete the sale. Brenda smiles, &quot;And you come back here anytime and we will get you both fixed up with whatever you need.&quot; Mrs. Spencer barely beats her husband to saying, &quot;We will be back&quot; in near unison. Mrs. Spencer turns to her husband, &quot;Honey, don't forget your clothes.&quot; You swallow your own lust as you watch the hung hermaphrodite bend over and pick up his loose fitting clothes and the out of place form fitting silver chaps. Brenda walks to the door to let the couple out, &quot;Thank you and come again.&quot; Both Spencers wave and offer additional gratitude, and a moment later, the bells ringing stops as Brenda locks the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm horny as hell now&quot; Brenda groans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too. I can't wait until we get home,&quot; you complain.<br />
<br />
You follow Brenda to the back lycra futon, and....</p>
