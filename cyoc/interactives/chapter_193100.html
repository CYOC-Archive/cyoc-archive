<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s vagina was disappointed to hear that <b>its</b> favorite singer was kicked off the show.  Likewise, Jeff himself vocalized that same disappointment.<br />
<br />
Well, TV time with the family was over.  Typically, everyone starts turning in for the night at this point.  Jeff, however, would go to bed after everyone else, for various reasons.  First was that he always showered before bed; he never liked going to bed sweaty from the day.  And then he&#39;d stay up long enough to dry, during which he&#39;d either hop online, or finish any homework he was unable to finish during TV time.<br />
<br />
While watching TV, there was very little movement from Jeff.  His vagina was starting to get used to <b>its</b> altered shape.  As soon as Jeff got up and moving again, though, the shifting of Jeff&#39;s legs around his vagina once again amplified how strange <b>its</b> new body felt.<br />
<br />
This was a two-bathroom home.  As soon as Melissa brushed her teeth, Jeff (and his vagina) had the bathroom all to himself.<br />
<br />
For the past few hours, Jeff&#39;s vagina had been imprisoned within the darkness of Jeff&#39;s pants.  Soon, though, light filled <b>its</b> hypothetical eyes when Jeff&#39;s pants were finally pulled down and tossed into the hamper.  Those &quot;hypothetical eyes&quot; were quick to adjust to the light, without the stinging pain that a sudden brightness would bring to real eyes.  Jeff&#39;s vagina wondered how bright a light <b>it&#39;d</b> be able to tolerate.<br />
<br />
From <b>its</b> vantage point, the bathroom was like a school gym to the small vagina.  <b>It</b> was unable to see above the nearby sink, but <b>it</b> could easily see the toilet off to the side, appearing larger and furthur away than normal.  <b>It</b> knew that <b>it</b> would have an intimate date with that toilet soon enough, but for now, there was an additional whole experience to come.<br />
<br />
Straight ahead was the bathtub.  Though it seemed furthur away than normal, the distance was quickly closed, as Jeff&#39;s legs swung around Jeff&#39;s vagina, walking their way to the tub.  One leg quickly lifted over the tub&#39;s edge, and then the other.  The large shower curtain was then pulled closed.  There was a moment&#39;s pause.  Jeff&#39;s vagina wondered if Jeff was observing <b>it</b>, though <b>it</b> was unable to see the face of Jeff from <b>its</b> vantage point, especially not with Jeff&#39;s pubic hair blocking <b>its</b> view above.  That was until Jeff leaned down, reaching for the faucet handle.  Jeff&#39;s vagina never thought <b>it&#39;d</b> see <b>its</b> former chin from this angle.<br />
<br />
After the water was turned on and warmed up, Jeff pulled the tab to start the shower.  This part was no different than normal, until the water started distorting Jeff&#39;s vagina&#39;s vision.  It was at this point that Jeff&#39;s vagina realized that <b>it</b> could not blink or close eyes that <b>it</b> didn&#39;t have.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, from somewhere within Jeff&#39;s vagina, there was a familiar, yet strong and misplaced feeling of anticipation.  And then, it happened.  As a habit, Jeff would pee in the shower, figuring it to be a way to save water, while also quickly draining the pee away.  Jeff&#39;s vagina felt and watched as pee poured out of <b>its</b> urethra, splattering on the floor near the front of Jeff&#39;s feet.  Jeff lightly cursed up above.  Turns out that without a penis, you can&#39;t really aim your pee away from you.  The experience was probably a little gross for the teenager who now had a vagina.<br />
<br />
For the source of the pee, though, the experience was even more so.  While Jeff&#39;s vagina had mentally prepared <b>itself</b> for fulfilling what was a natural purpose for vaginas, <b>it</b> had no idea that it would taste this rancid.  What&#39;s more, the activity made <b>its</b> new form seem even more alien.  While <b>it</b> had difficulty feeling out <b>its</b> urethra before, its strange location (from the perspective of a teenager-turned-vagina) was now prominently felt.  What&#39;s more, the sense of taste around <b>its</b> urethra seemed separate from the sense of taste within <b>its</b> larger orafice.  The experience was almost like having two very different mouths.<br />
<br />
At the very least, it wasn&#39;t an uncomfortable feeling.<br />
<br />
As the pee trickled to a stop, Jeff splashed some water into his vagina.  <b>It</b> then waited, as Jeff washed himself above.  Soon, a large hand soapy from shampoo came down, covering Jeff&#39;s vagina&#39;s view and smothering <b>it</b> with soap.  This was the most jarring experience, so far.  Having these giant fingers rubbing all over and into <b>its</b> alien form, opening <b>its</b> lips to clean <b>it</b> out.  It was when one of Jeff&#39;s fingers slipped into his vagina&#39;s larger orafice that Jeff suddenly yanked his hand away.  Jeff&#39;s vagina wasn&#39;t sure how <b>it</b> felt about this situation.  Even if by accident, <b>it</b> just now experienced being fingered.  Even though those were Jeff&#39;s fingers, his vagina had no sensation of them.  It was like someone else pushing their fingers into <b>it</b>.  Needless to say, Jeff&#39;s vagina was not ready for... THAT sort of experience.  Thankfully, the experience only ended with the taste of shampoo.  And though the shampoo also had an unpleasant flavor, it was at least better than the pee.  In fact, it even helped clean out the aftertaste of that pee, however little there was.<br />
<br />
At this point, Jeff&#39;s vagina was having second thoughts about this whole thing.  <b>It</b> wanted to know what it&#39;d be like being a vagina.  Well, now <b>it</b> kinda knew.  Was it worth it?<br />
<br />
...Maybe?  Though it was unpleasant, Jeff&#39;s vagina IS getting to experience something that <b>it</b> never would have as a person.  But <b>it</b> was now kind of wishing that <b>it</b> could communicate with Jeff, and let him know to merge <b>its</b> conciousness back to him.  At least tomorrow afternoon would not be too far off.  And it&#39;s not like living as a vagina would be like this the WHOLE time.  In hindsight, though, maybe they should&#39;ve planned to ease Jeff&#39;s vagina into this life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hindsight.&quot;  Maybe next time, Jeff and his vagina could try a different part of Jeff&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the shampoo was rinsed out of Jeff&#39;s vagina, and soon after, the shower ended.  Jeff&#39;s legs lifted around <b>it</b>, carrying them out of the tub.  Then came the toweling off.  Jeff&#39;s vagina watched as the towel dangled above and around <b>it</b>, until eventually the towel was used to dry <b>it</b> off.  Strange as it felt for <b>its</b> body to be rubbed, the end result was kinda... nice.  It always felt nice to be clean, but to be a clean vagina, was just extra nice.  Even if <b>it</b> still had that odd female taste within <b>itself</b>.<br />
<br />
As soon as Jeff finished drying himself off, his vagina watched as Jeff pulled a fresh pair of underwear up his legs, covering <b>it</b> up.  <b>It</b> could briefly see light filtered through the grey underwear, before a pair of pajama bottoms left <b>it</b> in the dark, once again.<br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t last long, though.  After some walking, both the pajama bottoms and underwear were pulled away, and Jeff&#39;s vagina was met with <b>its</b> reflection in Jeff&#39;s mirror.  Jeff was far enough that <b>it</b> could see Jeff in his entirety, up to his face.  This was the first time <b>it</b> had seen <b>itself</b> on Jeff&#39;s male body.  Just like when they were fully female, Jeff&#39;s vagina didn&#39;t look any different than a normal vagina.  Nobody would know that <b>it</b> was sentient just by looking at <b>it</b>.  They WOULD know, however, that <b>it</b> looked very out of place on Jeff&#39;s male body.  He wasn&#39;t a manly sort of male, but his body hair and overall body shape were definitely not feminine.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s vagina almost felt like <b>it</b> should be disgusted, seeing another naked dude.  But <b>it</b> still saw Jeff as <b>itself</b>, even if <b>its</b> perspective was from Jeff&#39;s crotch.  No, wait, there&#39;s the gross feeling.  As a person, <b>it</b> would not want to be anywhere near a dude&#39;s crotch.  Now <b>it</b> was a PART of said crotch.<br />
<br />
Jeff stepped closer to the mirror, sat his naked butt on the floor, and leaned back with his legs spread open.  His vagina watched as Jeff brought down his fingers, pressing two of them down his vagina&#39;s lips, and spread them open to look inside.  This was the first time Jeff&#39;s vagina felt air enter <b>it</b>.  Unfortunately, <b>it</b> could not see what the inside of <b>itself</b> looked like, as Jeff&#39;s hand was positioned in a way that blocked <b>its</b> vision.  <b>It</b> mentally yelled at Jeff to let <b>it</b> see, tried to find the muscles of <b>its</b> body to maybe get Jeff&#39;s attention, but there was no way to communicate with him.<br />
<br />
After a minute, Jeff let go of his vagina&#39;s lips, and got up off the floor.  On went the undewear and pajamas, again.<br />
<br />
Jeff was still lightly damp from the shower, but it would not take long for him to dry up, especially with his short hair.  Typically, he&#39;d head to bed as soon as he was dry.</p>
