<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Was on my way to Moon Lake when I came across this thread. Hope no one minds the addition.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Todd stared at the tigresses before him.<br />
His first thoughts, naturally, were of escape.<br />
It had not been the best of days for him so far.<br />
He had started out as a regular human being and everything seemed to be going well until it all went crazy in the Teachers&#39; Lounge.<br />
First he became a tiger, and he still wasn&#39;t quite sure if he was a traditional or anthropomorphic one.<br />
Next thing he knew, Mr. Todd was... elsewhere, surrounded by a bunch of lady tigers.<br />
A group that were all looking at him with a very <i>distinct</i> interest in their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it isn&#39;t so bad here,&quot; began the tigress that first spoke to him. &quot;Regular meals of good raw meat. Those funny looking things on the other side of our place can be quite interesting at times, staring at us like they&#39;ve never seen our kind before.&quot;<br />
&quot;They&#39;re human beings,&quot; replied Mr. Todd, looking up at the high walls and iron railings that surrounded the enclosure he and the tigresses found themselves in,  &quot;and until a little while ago, I was one too.&quot;<br />
The female stared at him with a confused expression on her muzzle. &quot;You feeling okay?&quot; the tigress asked. &quot;You certainly don&#39;t look like one of them. And you certainly don&#39;t smell like one either,&quot; she added, taking a good whiff of him.<br />
&quot;In fact, you smell <b>very</b> good,&quot; said the tigress, as she started sniffing closer to his lower extremities.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Mr. Todd wanted to know, afraid that he was about to be eaten alive.<br />
The fact that the other tigresses were now moving even closer to him was not lost on Mr. Todd, but something else was happening now.<br />
He felt a stirring between his legs as the first tigress sniffed what once would have been covered by trousers.<br />
Then, she turned around and laid on the ground in front of him before raising her tail and hind legs enough to offer him a very interesting temptation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on. You know you want to,&quot; said the tigress. &quot;It&#39;s been awhile since we&#39;ve had a virile male in here with us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m next!&quot; shouted another tigress, as the rest of the females present started circling around Mr. Todd and the one who was offering herself to him.<br />
&quot;Now see here...&quot; he began, trying to remember he was a gentleman, regardless of how he currently looked.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t let that go to waste!&quot; exclaimed another tigress. &quot;If you don&#39;t want her, take me instead,&quot; before she assumed a similar position, offering her body for his sexual pleasure.<br />
Mr. Todd looked and saw what had gotten all the females&#39; attention.<br />
A thick shaft was emerging from a furry sheath between his legs.<br />
A shaft that was growing harder by the second, and wanted some relief from the tension building within.<br />
&quot;I—&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; protested the first tigress, as she swished her butt and tail seductively at him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Todd stared at the sight before him.<br />
<i>It does look tempting...</i> he thought, feeling the new representation of his &quot;man&quot;hood twitch.<br />
Then a tantalizing scent crossed his nostrils.<br />
He took a deep breath.<br />
The first female offering herself to him was now highly aroused, and growing more excited by the second.<br />
&quot;Come on stud. Take me!&quot; she called out.<br />
At that moment, something within Mr. Todd snapped as any reason and logic he had (temporarily?) disappeared.<br />
With a loud ROAR he pounced upon the tigress, his front paws grasping her as his hard tiger-hood sank deeply into her furry depths.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help myself!&quot; Mr. Todd tried saying in apology.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop!&quot; was the tigress&#39; only reply.<br />
<br />
He kept thrusting his rod back and forth, feeling it sink deeper into her with each stroke.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; shouted the tigress, even as the other females looked on and licked their muzzles in anticipation of having their own turn with the new tiger.<br />
Despite whatever remained of his human mind, Mr. Todd let animal instincts take over his actions.<br />
His claws sank into her fur to hold his position. His tail swished madly in excitement as he continued driving his hard rod inside his partner until she shuddered in pleasure as he filled her with a large load of his seed.<br />
Spent, he laid on top of her.<br />
The tigress didn&#39;t seem to mind. In fact, she turned her head a bit and began licking his muzzle with her tongue in the tiger approximation of a kiss.<br />
Finally, the tension within was eased just enough for his cock to slip out of the tigress&#39; vagina.<br />
She laid there in contentment with the feline version of a smile on her muzzle.<br />
Mr. Todd turned and looked at the other tigresses gathered around him.<br />
Each was staring at the rod that gave their companion such pleasure.<br />
The fact that it was starting to regain its girth was not lost on anyone present.<br />
&quot;Next?&quot; roared Mr. Todd with excitement in his voice, as another female approached and positioned herself to be serviced by him.</p>
