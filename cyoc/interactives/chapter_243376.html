<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan walked inside the shower room where her lovely wife was waiting for her. The ceramic tiles on the bathroom floor produced enough heat that it felt more than comfortable to have impromptu sex on top of them. Susan’s balls churned like a mill as she remembered how she had put lot of money on her miniature spa that she called her, paradise, a little tropical island inside her house. The cost to run her mansion’s spa was under five numbers per month but for Susan that money was literal pennies. She earned more money than it took for her to spent it in Glendale. Only a luxurious sea yacht meant for ten thousand people might have made a small insignificant dent but even then the money would have crawled back to Susan’s wallet in no time.<br />
<br />
Susan’s miniature spa was kept warm with a transparent tent that took in the natural sunlight which kept the tropical scented air inside while the high-end ventilation made sure that the temperature never dropped below eighty five. On the middle of the spa there was a clear watered light blue pool water with real white sand surrounding it’s edges with imported sand from other side of the globe. The indoor pool’s radius was mile long from the center of the spa and there was a thirty feet of sand spread around it’s edges in a circle like rim. The pool had multiple arched walkways that formed a bridge on the small artificial island made out of real materials which was on the middle of the spa. It gave the space very realistic looking tropical island feel to it with two three story tall buildings that were made out of bamboo trees. On one of the bamboo buildings there was a tiki bar with two smiling female workers working behind the counter. The second building was a bamboo lodge that was maintained by the same two females that worked on the bar as they partially lived on it’s ground floor. All this was made when Susan had an idea to remodel her old bathroom to something more glamorous. Susan loved how she was able to remodel the buildings and beach surrounding it how ever she liked it on a whim. The hidden resort in her bathroom would have made outside people envious if they ever learned about it but it was the norm for Susan. She had always wanted to splurge her money on something big.<br />
<br />
Susan loved how there were no mechanical sounds on the beach as the water pumps were building deep underground with fans so quiet that they couldn&#39;t be heard from the surface and the only artificial noise came from the portable stereos that could be turned on and off at anytime. The pool’s sounds were kept natural which made sleeping in the bamboo lodge feel as realistic to the real lodge on an isle as possible. Susan and Felicia didn’t have to put on their wet suit or bikinis as it was mandatory for all of them, including the workers, to keep themselves as nude as possible. It was meant as a nude beach after all.<br />
<br />
“I’m so glad that I finally can enjoy this place.” Susan said to Felicia who walked towards her with a orange colored tiki drink in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Mmh-mm, the girls we hired are perfect and more than happy to serve our needs. They said that they would prepare us something to eat if we informed them thirty minutes prior eating. One of the girls told me that she trained all her life to become a chef to serve us the finest meal she could ever make. I&#39;m glad we found such a dedicated spirit that is sadly an outsider but she said that she has gotten used to Glendale’s norms and she is considering the offering to get her rack bigger through our company.” Felicia smiled while she slurped her drink.<br />
<br />
Susan gave a loving kiss to her wife’s cheek and elegantly looked at the beautiful personal resort she had build for her family. Susan loved how her wife called the paradise with so mundane name like ‘Showers’ as it originally was their mansion’s small bathroom. Susan’s dream was to visit new places after the college but because of the constant deal signing and busy meetings at her office building. She couldn’t afford travel to the outside world anymore. So the next best thing was to bring the outside world inside her own vicinity. This way Susan didn’t have to leave her house and Martha’s handmaidens made sure that Susan was kept informed inside the building where ever she was if she had to go back to the work.<br />
<br />
Susan noticed that Felicia had with her an one girl who acted as her moving extra pair of hands and took away the emptied drink from her wife when she signaled the girl to approach her. Felicia’s handmaiden girl kept her distance, but with a wave of a hand, the girl was ready to serve Felicia at any given time. Susan couldn’t spot her own service maiden but she didn’t care as she didn’t need anything at the moment.<br />
<br />
Susan asked from Felicia if she could give her a back massage on the near white beach bench for her while she mentally prepares herself for a swim. Today had been a rough day and the biggest urges for masturbation were satisfied with Tiffany. Susan was peckish to have sex with Felicia but wanted to wait for a perfect opportunity to do so. Susan imagined fucking her loving wife inside the cozy lodge while the nightly sounds surrounded them. Felicia begun her massage and gave small kisses on Susan’s neck. Susan tried to relax but she wondered why her daughter and her right hand maid Martha didn’t join with them to ‘showers’. Maybe they were too busy watching the lesbian theater on the theater room that she had build prior to the pool.<br />
<br />
“Feli, my dear. How long was the act in the theater room? Did the girls say it was going to be a two hour show?” Susan asked from Felicia.<br />
<br />
“Let me call the show manager maiden and ask her directly.” Felicia said and next to her a girl presented Felicia a handheld radio while explaining which channel out of twenty was the show manager’s number.<br />
<br />
At first Susan was surprised why her wife had that type of communication device but after Susan felt the familiar churning feeling. She knew that they had to use them as the estate was the largest and the most expensive land they had in Glendale. Susan’s home was run with thousands of hands and every corner of the house required a miniature golf cart or an electric scooter for movement. The whole house itself was a miniature town inside the city of Glendale which offered work for more grass rooted citizens who didn’t pass the beauty standards that Susan had invented and promoted all over the city. Even among the Glendale people some of them couldn’t work as prostitutes or sex workers as their body types weren’t suited for such a work. These people were gladly taken as the hard working people as groundskeepers, electricians, plumbers and similar type of workers where it didn’t matter what type of body they had. They were given good compensation for their hard work and they gladly worked for Susan.<br />
<br />
Susan made yearly speeches and gave credit to everyone for making sure that Susan’s Paradise Estates worked as they should have. Susan owned all the private and public schools, advertisement firms and the news stations in the city of Glendale which made it more easier to nudge potential workers on the right track when they entered to school life. Susan was on the top of the pyramidical hierarchy. Jennifer and Felicia was under Susan while Martha was under them. Rest of the people and the outsiders were below Martha as even Martha was considered very influential person and a fashion icon of the Glendale’s work force. Susan, Felicia and Jennifer had kept their autonomy in check while rest of the people in Glendale always served someone who had higher authority and power than they had.<br />
<br />
Susan felt that her throat was getting dry and wanted a tiki drink as well. She raise her hand and suddenly a maid approached next to her. She was Susan’s personal hand maiden and one step lower from Martha. A girl who Susan called her silent bodyguard and left hand’s pinkie finger. A girl, so tough as nails, that she made army men look bunch twinks in a hand-to-hand combat. She was more than ready to take a bullet for Susan with a stern look on her face as she took her job seriously.<br />
<br />
“Greetings my mistress. Rebecca saw that Mrs. Smith’s called her?” The girl sternly said as she watched to the distance and made no eye contact with Susan.<br />
<br />
 “Yes, Rebecca. Could you fetch me my favorite sugary drink from the tiki bar. They should know exactly how I like my drink if they don’t. Tell them to surprise me.” Susan asked from the girl.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my mistress. Orders received loud and clear.” Rebecca answered and like a graceful doe strutted to the tiki bar to take care of Susan’s business.<br />
<br />
Susan stretched her limbs and asked from Felicia when were Jennifer and Martha going to join them. Felicia told Susan that the stage mistress at other end of the radio&#39;s receiver had given Felicia a rough estimate that Jennifer and Martha should be with them in under an hour. Susan nodded her head as she wanted to spent that time to relax and enjoy the scene. Susan took her life as a blessing. The curse didn’t feel a curse anymore. It was giving her all the things she wanted. Susan looked at her wife and asked from her if she wanted to worship her husband’s huge cock. Felicia knelt in front of Susan and begun to lick the dick&#39;s both sides like an ice cream. Felicia nibbled the cock’s tip gently and spun her tongue like a merry-go-round to make it’s veiny shaft wet. This must have been her thousandth or so time to suck, fuck or play with Susan’s cock but something about it allured her wife to play it with like it was her first time.<br />
<br />
The sixteen inches was enormous cock it was a miracle the Felicia was able to swallow it so deep. The length and thickness of Susan cock made the whole thing challenging. Felicia’s mouth was never able to push her lips so far that they would reach Susan’s crotch, but this time it was different. Felicia wanted to prove herself and begun to push the inches one by one down her throat. Five inches went without a hitch but the rest were a struggle. Felicia pulled back after she got to the eight inch mark but quickly pushed one inch more.<br />
<br />
Susan saw and felt how Felicia’s throat bulged every time her wife inserted the cock deeper and deeper into her mouth. One inch after another Felicia begun to sweat and she was able to push her own limit so far that she was only two inches shy from achieving the impossible. Susan felt horny and her balls churned. Susan tried to held her ejaculation but it was clear that eighteen inches was too much for her wife.<br />
<br />
“Damn. Only sixteen inches. That’s my personal record, but oh well, maybe someday I’m able to take it all in.” Felicia said while she licked her lips and went for the last push.<br />
<br />
Susan couldn’t hold her feelings anymore and just like that shot both of the balls empty inside Felicia’s mouth and straight into her stomach. The two small satchels worth of sperm filled Felicia’s stomach and it begun to fill her up. The amount of sperm she had just swallowed was equivalent to a two sets of burgers, fries, sodas and small package of chicken tenders with sauce. Felicia’s lips slurped Susan’s cock like a piece of spaghetti and she thanked for the meal. Susan smiled as she heard her wife’s stomach making sloshing noises when her wife walked in front of her.<br />
<br />
Susan wanted to close her eyes and relax for a bit by the pool. Susan&#39;s stamina was finally running out and most of it was thanks for her lovely wife. Susan felt how her two eyes finally shut themselves and Susan begun her well earned rest.</p>
