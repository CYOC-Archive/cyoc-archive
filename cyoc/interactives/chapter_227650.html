<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We walked around the store for a few minutes, the small man browsing the aisles and occasionally picking out a couple of things. Eventually, he turned to look at me for a moment, and grabbed something from the bottom shelf that I couldn’t see. Eventually he went to pay for his selections, and when he did I spotted a leather jockstrap that was way too big to fit around his waist, but also way too small in that it in no way would fit the girthy package I saw imprinted on his shorts. After he paid, he turned and I felt him reach into my pocket and place something - I assumed the jockstrap - inside. “Consider it a gift for tonight. He smirked confidently and winked at me, making my heart flutter. <br />
After we exited the store, he turned back to me. <br />
“So are you gonna tell me your name or should I just call you ‘Big’?” He said, his light voice having more authority than I ever imagined a voice like his could have. <br />
“Oh, uh, Jason, sir.” I said, flustered.<br />
“Well Jason, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Theo.” He smiled at me, this time with less cockiness and more kindness. He handed me a business card that seemed large in his hands, but as I grabbed it, it seemed like it shrank in my much larger hand. The card was for a restaurant in the upper district of the city - a place called DiMarcino’s. The restaurant was well known for its upscale clientele, and was one of the most expensive places to eat in the whole city. <br />
“I’m thinking we go there for dinner. My treat of course, I don’t expect a big guy like you to have that kind of money, but I expect you to be wearing your gift. Oh, and make sure you dress nicely, no gym clothes. Put on your best vest, okay? I’ll see you at six.” He walked past me and I felt him smack my ass as he did, barely causing me any distress of course but the exhilaration I felt more than made up for the difference.<br />
I quickly made my way home and went straight to my closet, the excitement of the date was all I could think of. Theo was adorable, beaming blue eyes, his small slender frame sending me for loops in arousal. First thing I did was strip, pulling out the gift in my sweatpants pocket. The jockstrap was there, but there was something else too - a pair of thin black leather straps, designed to go around the upper arm and accentuate the bicep. <br />
I smiled seeing this, now feeling confirmed that the night would end at his place. I looked at the clock - 2pm. I had a couple hours still before I had to leave. I thought about it for a bit, and decided I would clean myself up, starting with shaving off the body hair. I felt that given where we were going for dinner, a fresh clean look would probably be best. After looking all over my bathroom for equipment to help me shave and not finding it, I gave up and pulled the book out from the steak drawer, opening it up and quickly scrawling “Jason Miller is hairless from the neck down except for his pubic hair, and is able to keep a clean-cut beard without needing to shave.” The familiar tingles returned, and I felt my body hair suck itself back into my body, leaving smooth skin, as if hair was never there in the first place. <br />
I then went to start getting dressed. It took me a few tries, but I eventually got the arm straps on along with the jockstrap. I took a quick look in the mirror and smirked to myself. I looked hot- no, I looked downright sexy. I turned to see my large muscular ass in the mirror, exposed by the thin straps of the jockstrap. I practiced some poses in the mirror, trying to find the best way to present myself for when things escalated to the bedroom. <br />
Then it was time for the rest of the outfit. It didn’t take long to find a pair of black dress pants, socks, and shoes that I quickly put on, excited to try on the new (to me) outfit. The pants were just tight, but just loose enough to move well in. They were, however, extremely tight around my glutes, filling me with a sense of pride. I had a couple options for a shirt - I could wear a button down dress shirt, a polo, or even go full out with a suit jacket. However, I settled on a white button down shirt that was far too tight around the chest, leaving the top three buttons undone so I could breathe - I suspected bought on purpose to expose my chest - and rolled the sleeves up. I didn’t wear any undershirt, since I felt that covering up my muscular pecs would be a crime, but I did put on a black vest, which fit to my form nicely, leaving the looseness of the dress shirt around my stomach behind in favor of a tighter fit. Lastly, I put on a gold chain necklace, to draw even more attention to my chest. After finally finishing getting dressed, I looked in the mirror one last time, and felt waves of confidence as I admired the vision of myself that I saw. Any top worthy of their massive dick wouldn’t be able to resist me tonight.<br />
I arrived about 15 minutes early, and waited outside for Theo to arrive. A few minutes after six, the host inside came out to see me. “You are Jason, correct? Master Theo is inside awaiting you at your table.” He the. escorted me inside, where I could admire the interior - the restaurant was beautiful inside, sconces made of gold, tables that were each secluded off from each other, granting privacy to the guests. But my eyes were glued on the man sitting at the table I was escorted to. <br />
Theo stood up and pulled the other chair out for me, and as he did I got full view of his outfit. He was wearing a sheer green top that billowed off his body, giving his dainty movements an extra helping of grace. His white pants were equally flowing, hanging loosely off his small waist. You could see his massive member hanging down his leg, visibly stiffening as he took me in. His hair had been pulled neatly into a bun. He beamed with delight as I sat down. <br />
“You clean up well, for such a big man.” Theo  said as he sat in the chair next to me, his arm “accidentally” slipping around my midsection, where he caressed the small of my back, giving me chills.<br />
“Y-you’re very beautiful, Theo, sir.” I stammered, the butterflies in my stomach getting the best of me. It sounded odd to me to hear such nervousness from such a deep, masculine voice. “Sorry, I’m a bit nervous… it’s been a while since I’ve been on a date.”<br />
“Don’t be nervous. It’s just you and me tonight.”</p>
