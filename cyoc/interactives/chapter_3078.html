<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julius watches in fascination as the tranformation starts running its course. 
<br />
Cody's three day stubble starts forming into a full beard. He scratches it absently, but doesn't wake from his sleep.
<br />
'How dense can this guy be?!' Julius wonders 'He's transforming and doesn't even realize it!' As Julius debates whether to wake Cody up or not, Cody wakes up. He looks at Julius with large brown eyes, that were not there this morning. He scratches his chest and belly, seemingly oblivious to the fur that was growing there and on his arms.
<br />
&quot;Hi, Julius.&quot; He yawns, not bothering to cover his mouth, and reveals that his teeth are sharper than before. When he finishes, he looks at Julius again. His mouth has extended slightly, and his nose has a slightly blackened look. &quot;What?&quot;
<br />
Julius shakes his head. 'What is WRONG with this guy?' he wonders. &quot;Haven't you noticed?&quot; asks Julian, with more than a hint of annoyance.
<br />
Cody takes a minute to look at himself. He carefully removes his shoes, which seem too tight. His feet are much longer and covered in fur. His arms are covered in fur, and his finger are thicker and more paw-like.
<br />
He smiles at Julian &quot;Yeah. I mean I could sorta feel myself transforming in my sleep, but I thought I was dreaming.&quot; He looks down at his hands, which are thickening. &quot;Er- better get my clothes off.&quot; He quickly and calmly derobes in front of Julian. His body is covered in white fur, and is starting to reshape itself. A nub of a tail has emerged, and Cody's ears are lengthening, He sticks out his tounge and begins to pant.
<br />
Julian is dumbstruck. &quot;WHY ARE YOU TAKING THIS SO CALMLY?!&quot; He yells at last.
<br />
Cody flinches a little, &quot;Ya don't need to shout, my hearing is improving!&quot; he says jokingly, but then looks at Julian seriously 
<br />
&quot;You wanna know why? Well, see, when I was younger, all the kids at school used to make fun of me. Then when I got to high school, things weren't much better. See, I'm gay, and I didn't bother to hide it. Now by the time I was in tenth grade I had this really bad selfesteem problem. At that point in time I was ready to do anything for a little love and caring, and this guy happened to notice me. He was a really hunky guy who happened to know some magic. Mainly it was transformation magic. He promised to be good to me, and we DID have a lot of fun together since he was gay too. One night, though, he suggested we go beyond being friends. He said we both knew what we wanted - well HE knew what he wanted - I wasn't so sure, but I wanted to make the relationship last. So we made love. My first time and it was fantastic. After that, we started doing it regularly. Then he suggested we try something a little more exciting. I would've done anyhting for him. That's when he started changing me into animals. The first couple times it was freaky, but after a while I got used to it. Finally he graduated - he was a year ahead of me - he promised we'd always be lovers and friends, but he left for college and I never saw him again. I tried to kill myself. Fortunately my parents stopped me. I recovered and came here to college. And that&quot; he said &quot;is why I'm not freaking out.&quot;
<br />
He casually  lifted his hand, which now bore a strong resemblence to a paw &quot;Some sort of dog?&quot; He asked.
<br />
Julian nodded vaguely, but couldn't quite hide his pity - or his anger. His anger over Cody's lack of housekeeping skills seemed so silly now.
<br />
Cody was still transforming. He was now sitting on his haunces. His legs were covered in the white, felted coat common to komondors. His upper bod had lost its flab and had taken a strong, well-built form. Julius watched as Cody let the transformation sweep over him, his arms extending and changing into legs, his mouth pushing out into a muzzle and, finally, thick, corded white fur covering his body. He was a huge dog now, standing 36 inches at the shoulders. He looked at Julius with all too human eyes.
<br />
&quot;I thought I would made you my familiar.&quot; said Julius, scratching Cody on his head.
<br />
&quot;Why don't you?&quot; asked Cody.
<br />
Julian almost fell backwards &quot;Y-you can still talk?!&quot;
<br />
Cody eyed him &quot;Of COURSE I can still talk! ALL familiars can talk! Or didn't you read that?&quot;
<br />
Julian blushed, of course he had read it, but he'd forgotten it after Cody revealed his past. He also remembered that a familiar was almost as smart as the wizard he was companion to - it was much easier than dealing with a 'normal' animal.
<br />
&quot;I -well- I&quot; Julian looked at COdy. He was every bit the dog that Julius had wanted - large, friendly, intellegent. But he wasn't sure he could go through with the binding ceremony. Not after what Cody had told him. Cody, however, seemed pleased with his new form. He was looking at himself in the mirror. Julian walked up to him. &quot;Listen, Cody, I think I should change you back I -&quot;
<br />
He was stopped by a soulful look from Cody, one remarkably like that of a real dogs.
<br />
&quot;I - I really like you Julius.&quot; he said &quot;I mean I know I drive you crazy with the mess I make, but your a damn decent person. I -I'd be honored to be your familiar. It's not like I had a future as a wizard or anything.&quot;
<br />
&quot;But what you said about turning into animals before...&quot;
<br />
Cody licked Juliuses hand &quot;That was different. He was in it nly for the sex. You wanted me as your familiar. Familiars and their owners are always deeply bonded. It's almost like being married.&quot; he looked at Julian &quot;You do like me, don't you? I thought I saw it on a couple of occasions, but I was afraid. Afraid that I'd be taken in again.&quot;
<br />
&quot;But I...&quot; Julian started. He had cast the spell because he had been angry. Or had he? He could have turned Cody into a normal animal, but he had chosen for him to become his familiar. Not any familiar, but a familiar animal he always deeply desired. Why? 
<br />
'Because' Julius suddenly realised 'because I really do like him.'
<br />
He looked down at Cody, who was wagging his tail.
<br />
&quot;Told ya!&quot; he said, smiling.
<br />
Julius smiled back. The full binding ritual was in the book. After he and Cody were finished, he'd have to give Cody a new name. He reached for the book and performed the spell. Suddenly Julius could feel Cody within himself - and Cody could feel Julius. The two stared at each other a minute.
<br />
&quot;The room IS messy isn't it?&quot; said Cody.
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe not THAT bad...&quot; said Julius.
<br />
&quot;I could use a name.&quot;
<br />
&quot;How does Ramseys strike you?&quot;
<br />
&quot;LOVE IT!&quot; He licked Julius &quot;Well, now what?&quot;</p>
