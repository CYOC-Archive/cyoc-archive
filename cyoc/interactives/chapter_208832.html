<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can&#39;t believe Nat got grounded for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she did take something from her mom,&quot; Miranda shrugged. &quot;What would Mama do of you took something from her?&quot; Miles shuddered, chances were if he had stolen from his mother he would be fortunate to escape with only  being grounded.<br />
<br />
As the Desoto twins and Amara continued passing out candy, they xhatted about everything that occurred. The shade that caught them by surprise, however, they were thankfully able to eliminate it before it could hurt anyone else. Now the teens were able to relax as they worked at the schools Halloween event.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still trying to wrap my head around Nats powers,&quot; Amara stated. The mara was sporting a pair of cat ears as she passed candy out to a series of elementary school students. &quot;And I&#39;m still trying to figure out your costume,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;Your a nightmare demon. How is a cat scary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cats scare me,&quot; Amara grumbled. &quot;Their small, those big eyes, why do you think I shapeshift into a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore him Mi Amore,&quot; Miranda smirked. &quot;Miles here is scared of chihuahuas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chihuahuas!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikes turned beat red as Miranda began to giggle. Amara now turned to the twins wondering where Miles fear came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Miles was five our Titi visited with her little dog Pepe,&quot; Miranda grinned. &quot;Pepe started growling at Miles and chased him around the house. He ended up hiding in a closet for half an hour because Pepe wouldn&#39;t let him out.&quot; Amara now tried to stifle a laugh as Miles now frowned at the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little dogs freak me out,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Like little rats with needle teeth man. They&#39;re the worse.&quot; Miranda and Amara couldn&#39;t contain their laughter any longer. Both girls bursting into laughter much to Miles chagrin.  At least they no longer had to worry about anything else awful happening.<br />
<br />
************************************<br />
<br />
Somewhere on the Nebraska border<br />
<br />
Kayla finished wiping down the bar as she gazed at the patrons of the Silver Moon Saloon. The small bar in the middle of nowhere was watering hole for a certain segment of society. The clientele of the bar often times kept to themselves. After all they all had a sickness, a sickness that often made them a target.<br />
<br />
Kayla smirked, looking at the dozen regulars that now mingled inside the bar. People were playing pool, chatting, shooting darts, the usual fair that Kayla had grown accustomed too. Tonight though had brought an additional patton, a skinny looking man who was now talking a bit too loudly about something back east. As Kayla eavesdropping, her face formed into a frown. <br />
<br />
The young man was a vampire. Kayla wasn&#39;t a fan of vampires. They were often to boastful, thinking with their fangs and their stomachs. Other members of the supernatural community tried to keep a low profile, staying off the radar of any potential threat. It was how they managed to stay alive. Before Kayla could say anything, she noticed a rather large man enter the bar.<br />
<br />
From Kayla&#39;s guess, she figured the man probably stood about six and a half feet tall with greasy long hair, a thick mustache and generous amount of growth on his face. From his dress and demeanor, Kayla thought he might be in a bike gang. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a biker had wondered in here. Kayla grinned at the thought, in any other bar this guy would be the toughest man in the bar. At Silver Moon though, he was a very small fish in a very big pond.<br />
<br />
The man now lit a cigar, glowering at the patrons of the bar as he began to move towards the vampire. &quot;Hey no smoking in here,&quot; Kayla yelled. The man ignored her, Kayla watching as he spun the vampire around jabbing a knife into his shoulders and pinning him to the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Kayla exclaimed. &quot;The hell is your problem?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Piss off bitch,&quot; he growled. &quot;Ain&#39;t none of your concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla frowned, looking first to the man then her patrons. Already she could her patrons nodding, the dozen men and women standing as they slowly moved towards the bar. &quot;Last chance pal,&quot; Kayla growled. &quot;Beat it and you won&#39;t get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man now slowly straightened, a low chuckle escaping him as he gazed at each person inside the Silver Moon Saloon. &quot;Yall can&#39;t be serious,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Do you werewolf mutts think you got a chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla balked, how did this guy know who frequented this bar. Studying him and the vampire, she now listened to the vampire shout a warning to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Ezekiel Kane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kane,&quot; Kayla gasped. <br />
<br />
Kayla and the others now began to transform. Kane was a boogeyman to the supernatural community. A demon hunter bent on torturing any and all creatures with even a hint of inhumanity. For Kane it didn&#39;t matter if you lived peacefully, it didn&#39;t matter if you left humans alone. Kane was interested only in killing monsters and any humans that helped them.<br />
<br />
At the mention of Kane men, the other werewolves began to transform. Their bodies twisting as they grew larger, more muscular. Their faces stretching into lupine proportions, fangs glistening in the faint light as fur covered their bodies. Kayla too now transformed, the werewolf bartenders claws lengthened, her face contorting, her mouth becoming a muzzle with razor sharp teeth, while her body became covered with black fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave Kane,&quot; Kayla growled. &quot;Its 13 to 1, real bad odds even for a hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kane simply chuckled, the hunter blowing out a cloud of smoke from his cigar. &quot;I&#39;m gonna enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kane was fast, Kayla hadn&#39;t even noticed the shotgun the hunter had been hiding. Before she could act Kane had already unloaded a pair of shells into the two nearest werewolves. Kayla looked on in horror as the werewolves lay dying from the silver buckshot. <br />
<br />
Kane now dove into the group of werewolves, the large hunter far quicker than Kayla had anticipated. He now systematically began carving his way through them useing a silver buck knife and pistol. Kayla was stunned, watching friends and family gutted by the remorseless killer.  Screaming, she now lept at Kane, looking to tear the hunter to pieces.<br />
<br />
Kane smirked, dodging Kaylas attack before sinking his knife into the werewolf. With a flick of his wrist he now gutted her like a fish, Kayla&#39;s entrails spilling out on the foor as she sank to her knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess your the alpha of this little pack,&quot; Kane grumbled as he grabbed Kayla by the throat. &quot;Dont worry! After I&#39;m through here gonna make sure the rest of the pack joins ya in hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla tried to cry out, the pack had always been peaceful, finding this secluded area to live peacefully. Some of their family weren&#39;t even werewolves. Kane didn&#39;t care, anyone who associated with demons deserved death. The hunter now slit Kayla&#39;s throat, almost severing her head from her body as she collapsed dead to the floor.<br />
<br />
Kane now spat on her corpse, relighting his cigar as he now approached the vampire. &quot;Listen man I won&#39;t say anything,&quot; the vampire cried. &quot;Please, just let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that easy,&quot; Kane growled. &quot;You&#39;re a monster, and I kill monsters!&quot;<br />
<br />
The vampire simply whimpered, Kane grabbing the knife embedded in his shoulder and twisting it. The vampire howled in pain as Kane grinned maliciously. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats the name of that town you came from,&quot; Kane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The town,&quot; the vampire asked. &quot;Why? The vampires fled. The Morelands saw to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morelands,&quot; Kane grumbled. &quot;Damn boy scouts! Only hunting the monsters that have already hurt humans. Small minded bastards, don&#39;t they realize its us or them!&quot;<br />
<br />
The vampire said nothing, casting the hunter an odd look. He had run into hunters before, but this was different. Kane was blood thirsty, so filled with hate of the supernatural that it had become a crusade. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Kane threatened, his voice little more than a whisper. &quot;Your going to tell me what I want to know. Tell me the town back east.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll let me go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Kane chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll just make you don&#39;t suffer as much.&quot; Kane&#39;s face now contorted into a malicious grin as he now began to interrogate his latest victim.</p>
