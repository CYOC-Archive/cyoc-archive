<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Wizard teleports Mary and himself back to the center of the Buttundoa town market in blinding flash of light. But in the middle of the night, few are even awake to notice. Those that are awake are currently patrons of the tavern and pay no mind. They are alone on the cobblestone street as the full moon hangs in the night sky overhead.<br />
<br />
The Wizard in his white robe lowers his staff and tends to his new wife. &quot;Mary, are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting a hand to her stomach, the rumbling has seemed to dull. But she can hear thunder rolling in the distance as it does, as softly as you would hear the sea in a seashell. &quot;The pain has mostly gone away. Can I go home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, we are married now. We can share a home.&quot; Mary nods and somewhat sadly turns to walk to the Wizard&#39;s cottage. &quot;But if you wish, I will build you a new home, a castle, where your cottage now stands. It will be my first present to you.&quot; He takes her hand, kisses it.<br />
<br />
Mary smiles. &quot;That would make me very happy, Wizard. Thank you.&quot; She accepts his hand, and the couple walk arm-in-arm to his home, their home.<br />
<br />
That night Mary found herself sleeping in a bed with a man for the first time. But her stomach continued to rumble through the night. The Wizard brewed calming teas and potions for her but nothing calmed it. So she managed to only fall asleep when the Wizard cast a small sleeping charm on her. Her dreams were full of visions of her running in an endless field under a purple storming sky.<br />
<br />
When she wakes up, the Wizard begins his duty to fulfill his sacred path to provide Mary with anything her heart desires. First, he conjures up a whole closet full of ornate and exotic gowns, shoes, and jewelry; all expensive enough to make a Duchess weep. Then he summons up a perfectly hearty and delectable breakfast for her to indulge in. The former peasant almost does not know what to do with so much food, but she happily does the best she can to eat every last crumb. Then with her belly full, the Wizard takes her outside his home and into the town to where a pair of immaculate white stallions are fixed to a gleaming golden & purple, not enclosed, carriage for two.<br />
<br />
The townspeople gather as the otherworldly beasts stand there proudly as a mysterious wizard leads the most alluring woman in the world inside to sit. The men and women of Buttundoa all stare in awe at Mary and a crowd quickly begins to gather. Soon after only having the horses move a few feet, they have to stop because the whole of the town and the traveling merchant caravan have surrounded the carriage. The Wizard stands to address the crowd, holding his golden staff&#39;s large ruby up into the sky. &quot;People of Buttundoa, the maid Mary has been made my wife by the King of All Gods. You will regale her as your Patron Lady and treat & respect her as royalty. She has been blessed by the gods and deserves your recognition. All hail Lady Mary, the Most Beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheers back, swept up in the powerful charm of their new queen. The townspeople that might seem wary are quickly won over by the intense beauty of the woman in the carriage. And the fewer still that are suspicious are kept subordinate by the clear servitude of the all powerful town wizard. The crowd cheers and suddenly talk of presenting gifts comes out in the group. A prized goat here, a few extra jewels there...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Mary! Wait!&quot; Someone is pushing their way through the crowd to get to the front. Joseph, the one who broke Mary&#39;s heart, is fighting his way to the her. With a wave of her hand, the crowd parts for him and he runs up to the carriage and bows. Out of breath, he tries to approach the door to the cart to get close. &quot;Mary, my Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tries to reach inside to touch her, but the Wiazrd aims his staff at Joseph, the ruby spinning and boiling hot with power. &quot;Stay away from the Lady Mary, mortal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary raises her delicate hand. &quot;Wizard, wait. This is the one who hurt me. Joseph.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard&#39;s staff almost growls, but he does not activate whatever horrible spell he has at the ready. Joseph tries to charm his way out of an imminent end. With his hands up, he backs up a few feet from Mary, and the crowd gives him a berth behind him. &quot;Mary, my one true love. I never intended to hurt you. I promised myself to you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remembered. You were the one who came back with a wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph is begging. &quot;Please Mary. I was wrong. I should be with you, not Valeria. You are the most beautiful girl in the world, she could never compare to you. I&#39;ll do anything. Take me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary stands, confidently with her archmage husband, loyal citizens, and divine inner strength protecting her. Thunder rolls in the distance beyond the valley as she gathers this strength. Even after all of this time, he still only cares about one thing. &quot;I will grant you that wish, Joseph. However, I am already married to a man who helped after you broke my heart. He made me who i am today and I will never leave his side. But your charge will be to stay in Buttundoa, your wicked wife too, and live as my servant. You will do anything and everything I ask until the end of your days.&quot;  As she punctuates his sentence, lightning strikes the peak of the tallest mountain surrounding the valley and thunder crashes down.<br />
<br />
Joseph bows again at the sign and accepts his fate. &quot;Thank you, your Highness. I will not let you down.&quot; He melts back into the crowd.<br />
<br />
The Wizard raises his staff again and addresses the crowd. &quot;People of Buttundoa. Your Lady Mary is a divinely gifted woman, so Buttundoa is divinely gifted under her.&quot; He points his staff at her dilapidated cottage far up the hillside of the valley wall. Letting forth a blast of crackling purple energy, he strikes the house from this incredible distance. Upon contact, the walls begin to glow purple and morph and grow taller and wider as the home itself begins to change. No longer are bricks missing or straw thatching falling loose. But her view of her home is soon obstructed by a grand wall of stone rising up from the ground. Six towers grow from the wall, two on either side of the entryway, two on the corners, and two against the mountainous wall of the valley until a grand fortress of grayish blue stone settles into place. Large iron gates form from nothing in the entryway and lively purple runes visibly glow, setting into place a ward of some kind. &quot;This is her new castle. She will be there to bring good fortune to the people of the village and keep the gods&#39; might and my power in your favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd gasps and murmurs in the presence of such powerful magic, but Mary is pleased. &quot;Thank you Wizard. I love my new home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you, Queen of my heart. Come, let&#39;s go to our new home.&quot; The horses begin to trot down the path to Mary&#39;s new castle and the townspeople all cheer and sing her praises. Joseph follows along, but is further behind as he is getting berated by the wicked Valeria.<br />
<br />
Once Mary reaches her castle, the pampering never ends. She is presented with more fine food than she could ever eat, though she certainly tries. The Wizard hires half of the town to serve in the castle so she never has to lift a finger for anything. And so many dresses have been stuffed into her closet that she can hardly expect to wear them all.<br />
<br />
But through it all, she still dreams of the storms at night. Thunder rumbles in her ear when she is still and soon she can feel it inside of her belly. She tells no one, not even the Wizard. But after two months, she cannot hide it any longer. She has started to grow round in her belly, despite not yet letting anyone touch her besides her maids to dress her. And she is beginning to crave stranger and more exotic foods than ever before. All while the thundering in her belly never ceases.<br />
<br />
One evening, she sends word to the Wizard to meet in her bedchamber. He eagerly arrives, for he had not been given the privilege to visit her and consummate their marriage. In fact, he has hardly seen her outside of meals together. But even then, she is so quickly surrounded by her ladies in waiting that they hardly have a moment to themselves. &quot;Dearest Mary, how may I serve you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She calls out from her closet &quot;Wizard, we were blessed on the day of our wedding, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, by Zeus himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe Zeus gifted me with a something special.&quot; She walks out of her closet cradling her growing stomach. &quot;I am with child.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Wizard is completely enchanted by her pregnant form. He immediately falls to his knees. &quot;My Mary, we have truly been blessed. You are to bear Zeus&#39;s child. This is excellent news.&quot; He calls out to the hallway for a servant and Joseph comes running in. He has gotten fat since coming to work in the castle despite all of the running around he does for the Wizard. He also appears weary since Valeria had given birth to his triplet sons and has all but left him. &quot;Joseph, tell everyone to gather for a feast. The Lady Mary is bearing the child of Zeus.&quot;</p>
