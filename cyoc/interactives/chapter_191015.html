<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another week later...<br />
<br />
Andrew Parker was thinking about other things that day after work - he hadn&#39;t checked in at the nursing home yet to see if the people there had begun regressing as he had, but this was largely due to him being distracted with how good he felt. While he didn&#39;t want to break the corporate policy about sleeping with coworkers, he saw fewer problems about meeting women from outside of work. Hence his current situation with the young woman Amanda. She said she had no problem with older men, and obviously so.<br />
<br />
Given she was moving her hips up and down on his cock, and really owning the pleasure she was feeling right now. Andrew didn&#39;t remember how long it had been since he had enjoyed sex this much. He pumped his hips up into her, and she moaned - her pussy was nice and wet, and she was one of the most vibrant women at that bar he&#39;d tried hitting up. At first he thought he might not really have much of a chance with a 24 year old bombshell like her.<br />
<br />
She was a beautiful blond with a generous chest, an athletic body, and damn that ass showed right through the skinny jeans she wore that seemed to entice the majority of the guys in the bar. Yet here she was - with him. Him in particular. Andrew wondered if there might be some residual effect on him since he took the tree over to the retirement home. He was if anything even fitter still than earlier - just the other day he saw that his four pack had developed further into a six pack.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Andrew felt thrilled despite how much he should be worried about this. He was after all feeling younger, fitter, and figured he could worry about it later. Ohh fuck, and his dick was a good bit more sensitive now. &quot;Fuck...fuck, I&#39;m gonna cum.&quot; He heard Amanda let out a gasp and before long she got off of him to take it on her face. Better than potentially getting pregnant off of a hook-up. Andrew was pleased by how much control he had - though he had to wonder given how good that had felt...<br />
<br />
Ahh, the orgasm rushing over him...<br />
<br />
Andrew relished in it and felt his release seem to pulse through his body before several spurts of cum released, one after the other. His muscles twitching and his face registering utter, total relief. Once Amanda was done, she said, &quot;Thanks for the good time, big guy. You&#39;re...you&#39;re that big shot local businessman, Andrew Parker, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me,&quot; Andrew said, leaning back and enjoying the afterglow, &quot;What about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe this could be a recurring thing. A repeat job, if you will,&quot; she joked, and whereas Andrew a few weeks ago would&#39;ve sternly denied her, Andrew now thought about how sexy it would be - and how much of a relief it would be - to get regular sexual service after work.<br />
<br />
He knew he should try and maintain a certain level of professionalism, but so long as it just happened after work, and she didn&#39;t bother anyone at the job site, he saw no reason not to let this single hook-up become more of a friends with benefits situation. &quot;Alright so, as far as your position, I am thinking &quot;friends with benefits&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of benefits...&quot; she dreamily responded as she cleaned herself off. Fuck but she was starting to turn him on again...when was the last time he could get it up so soon after such a cum? &quot;Oh, again? I&#39;ve got some special work in mind, Mr. CEO.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to seeing your productivity, Miss Amanda.&quot; He said with a grin as he leaned back, grabbing the edges of the bed with his arms and subtly flexing, tensing his arms and chest. Ohh yeah, looked like this was gonna be fun...<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Another round later, and Andrew was rather surprised by how good it felt. She had orally pleased him that time, and eased him into a different kind of pleasure. She&#39;d put one of her fingers into his ass, and he was rather surprised by how much that had affected him. He at first needed to overcome a little bit of &quot;isn&#39;t this kind of weird?&quot; before she had shown him how sensitive that spot back there could be. He remembered all the way back in sex ed how men had something like a g-spot in there.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never had it pleased before...and now, he was wondering if he might be interested in going for that again.<br />
<br />
Amanda had to go apparently, and left after getting dressed and gave him her number and address &quot;in case he needed his sexual consultant&quot;. Andrew barely took any downtime after his hook-up left - he already planned a little jog to really enjoy his body. Whereas most of the times when he jogged he wore a tracksuit pair of pants and a long sleeved shirt, this time he disregarded shirts and went running outside in just the tracksuit pants and running shoes.<br />
<br />
And he could tell as he ran that he was the object of a number of people&#39;s attraction.<br />
<br />
As he jogged he increasingly saw that he was not the only one with this idea. His underling Kyle had apparently left his house to go run. Kyle had been 40, and a good worker if rather prone to taking on those kinds of workloads that left him unable to workout as much as he liked. The man&#39;s light brown hair was combed back and gelled, but only so much could be done to divert attention from his hairline. Kyle had some wrinkles, and a somewhat more dad bod-like body that Andrew swore he would never end up like.<br />
<br />
Now? Kyle&#39;s hair was thicker, longer, and he&#39;d evidently had to tie it back in a ponytail. He too had gone out without a shirt on, letting the world see that Kyle had developed a more toned, muscular physique. Not as ripped as Andrew&#39;s, but quite brawny in the chest, shoulders, and with a nice, wide back. His biceps were large but didn&#39;t have much tone. His stomach was still somewhat chubby, but more tight - more a ball gut, with tight muscle not far behind it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good, sir!&quot; Kyle said with a smile, &quot;I saw you in the bar earlier, admittedly. You and Amanda seemed to really hit it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was in the bar, too? Andrew didn&#39;t worry and asked, &quot;You find anyone there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Kyle said lecherously, &quot;Two, in fact. Lisa and Gabrielle. Bad babes and total hard bodies. Oh you should&#39;ve seen what they did for me.&quot; Kyle? 40 year old, workaholic Kyle was out here getting two women into bed with him? Could there be some aspect of this change that affected mentality? It required some further inspection. He decided to run alongside Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind if I joined you for the run?&quot; Andrew asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, go right ahead man,&quot; Kyle said with a grin, &quot;I swear, we&#39;re probably the two sexiest men in the corp now. I mean, if we could just have that workplace fraternization rule relaxed a little...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening, by the way,&quot; Andrew said with a wry smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well, it WAS worth a shot,&quot; Kyle said chuckling at the idea. He hadn&#39;t expected to change it just out of the blue. More testing the waters. &quot;You know, there&#39;s a spa down by my house. Would you be down for trying it out? I mean, I&#39;ve heard how dealing with water weight is good for muscular development...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re speaking my language, go on,&quot; Andrew responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I heard it can really help you look more toned. I&#39;m more of a size guy myself,&quot; Kyle said and flexed his arm, &quot;but I figure a little tone couldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded, and found himself feeling odd when it came to Kyle. There was something weirdly flirtatious about all of this. But neither of them liked men - Andrew had only ever had sex with women, and he knew Kyle from experience only had relationships with women. But it seemed Kyle had intended for these vibes to be sent. Kyle put a hand on Andrew&#39;s shoulder as they stopped at a light during their jog, &quot;Now, I know this may sound kind of weird. And I&#39;ve never done anything like it before myself. But I&#39;m wondering if there might be some chance you and I might be able to experiment a bit during the sauna.&quot;<br />
<br />
Experiment...? Andrew wasn&#39;t so far removed from college that he didn&#39;t know what Kyle meant. Both of them hadn&#39;t exactly had any experience in the matter, but they knew well enough that college men sometimes...tested the waters on the other side so to speak. Andrew had no opposition to such behaviors, but he was worried about this setting a precedent.<br />
<br />
Kyle was a very attractive man indeed, and so was Andrew. So he worried that someone might read something into Kyle&#39;s job if info about their dalliance got out from the spa. &quot;We can&#39;t really talk ab---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens in the spa, stays in the spa, my friend,&quot; Kyle said with a nod, acknowledging the point. He had no intention to turn this into anything more than, well, an experiment. And he was down to conduct it with the current most attractive guy at the company. Both men were otherwise straight, but considering the recent changes, Kyle had figured it might be something worth exploring just for the sake of seeing if they liked it.</p>
