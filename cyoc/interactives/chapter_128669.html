<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully for everyone the rest of the weekend passed smoothly. Although Kumiko, Cole, and Julia were upset they kept their word and didn’t tell the girls parents. When Lisa found out the whole story she immediately sat down with Katie to talk. To her great relief she discovered Katie was still a virgin and that her and Kellie both realized they weren’t ready for that. Now with school ending Lisa had invited the girls over for a girls night.<br />
<br />
“Thanks again mom for letting everyone hangout here tonight,” Katie said happily as she helped clear the table. Lisa smiled as she now loaded the dishwasher. “No problem kid,” she said. “I’m looking forward to this.”<br />
<br />
The sound of the doorbell ringing brought Katie and Lisa to attention. Quickly now made her way over to the front door to see Claudia, Julia, Mika and Kumiko standing there. “Hi guys come on in,” Katie said happily. The four smiled as they brought in overnight bags. Katie paused for a moment as she looked at Kumiko and Julia. Both women had bags in hand as they entered. Julia was returning to work in a couple of days so Katie assumed she was just getting somethings together before her trip. Kumiko on the other hand surprised her, she at first thought it might of been Mika’s. When Katie saw Mika drag hers into the side room while Kumiko held onto hers she began to wonder.<br />
<br />
Before Katie had time to think though another knock announced the more guests had arrived. Throwing the door open Katie smiled to see Kellie, Samantha and Mary Elise standing at the door. “Guess the gangs all here,” she said happily as she escorted her friends inside. As they passed the kitchen Katie looked in. Lisa, Kumiko and Julia were happily laughing and talking. As the three adults looked out at Katie they suddenly stopped talking, sporting an impish smile as they gazed at Katie and her friends. Although puzzled Katie shook off the feeling, joining her friends on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for having us all over tonight Katie,” Mary Elise said. “It’s been way too long since we all had a chance to hangout.” Katie smiled as she looked at her friends. “I’m just happy you could all come over. We haven’t all hung out together lately so this seemed like the best possible time.”<br />
<br />
Katie paused once again to glance into the kitchen. The three adult women seemed very giddy as they talked quietly amongst themselves. Katie couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off turning to Kellie she now beckoned her girlfriend closer. “What’s up Kat,” Kellie whispered. Katie frowned slightly as she looked over her shoulder. “Any idea why the three of them seem so happy,” she asked motioning towards Lisa, Kumiko and Julia. Kellie shrugged her shoulders. “Not really,” She said. “I know Kumiko and Julia have been talking a lot lately so maybe they’re just being friendly.”<br />
<br />
Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully before she could say anything though the doorbell rang. Curiously the girls now all looked at each other. “Did you order pizza Katie,” Samantha asked. Katie shook her head, they hadn’t ordered pizza and with everyone here they weren’t expecting anyone else. Cautiously she now made her way to the door. Opening Katie now gaped at the two people standing on her front porch. “Ashley!? Jennifer!?!”<br />
<br />
“Hey Katie,” Ashley said. “Thanks for the invite.” Ashley nodded as she looked at her friend. “Yeah we were a bit surprised but we appreciate it, this should be a lot of fun.”<br />
<br />
Before Katie could say anything Lisa, Kumiko and Julia came up from behind. “Ash, Jen,” Lisa said happily. “Glad you could make it. Why don’t you join the others in the living room. We’ll be joining all of you in just a sec.”<br />
<br />
They watched as Ashley and Jennifer now entered the living room, where Katie could see her friends looking at Ashley and Jennifer in confusion. Katie now turned to her aunt in confusion. “Mom what’s going on,” she asked. Lisa smiled impishly as she looked at Katie. “Okay I know that’s a surprise and this is last minute but I’ve been talking with Julia and Kumi and well we want to have some fun.”<br />
<br />
Katie furrowed her brow as she looked at Lisa and her friends. “What kind of fun we talking about,” she asked, having an idea where this was going.<br />
<br />
“Lisa told us about your sleepover,” Kumiko smiled. “We were thinking something like that....with a twist.”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed before smiling. “Okay as long as were careful but what is this twist.<br />
<br />
“We’ll explain in the living room,” Julia smirked. “We just wanted to know if you were willingly go along with it.” Katie nodded, agreeing to their idea as they made their way into the living room.<br />
<br />
As they headed into the living room Katie could see her friends giving her a confused look. Lisa now stepped forward smiling broadly. “Thanks for coming girls,” She’s said happily. “So I’d say that the last month has been...interesting. Sooo keeping with that theme me, Kumi and Julia kinda came up with a fun idea. If you could all just follow us into the garage I’ll explain.”<br />
<br />
Curiously the girls now followed Lisa into the attached garage. As they entered they could see a folding table setup with a series of cups arranged on either side. Lisa smiled as she turned to the girls. “Well girls in case your wondering I setup this table for a game of beer pong,” she said. “Before anyone gets too excited there’s no beer, just soda. I know all of you have been to parties so chances are you’ve either seen this.”<br />
<br />
The girls all nodded somewhat sheepishly as they looked at Lisa. Lisa continued to smile. “Awesome so everyone knows how to play,” Ashley now stepped forward, curious as to what was going on. “Um Ms. O’Toole,” she said quietly. “We Uh all have played before but if there’s no beer then what’s the penalty for losing?”<br />
<br />
“Well Ashley I’m glad you asked,” Lisa grinned. “You see I deliberately setup ten cups. All of us are playing tonight but instead of losing a drinking beer if you lose....you lose years.”<br />
<br />
The girls now all gawked as they realized what Lisa was saying. The ten cups equaled ten years that they had to lose. Every time someone lost a cup that person would become a year younger. “Wait hold on,” Samantha exclaimed. “For us ten years is a lot but for you guys that’s not so many.”<br />
<br />
“We thought of that,” Julia said. “That’s why when we play our cups are worth a few more years.”<br />
<br />
“Girls,” Kumiko said. “I know that it’s a lot to take in but from what I’ve seen and heard this could be a lot of fun. That and I’m sure some of you would just love to knock someone here down a few pegs, so to speak.”<br />
<br />
As the girls looked each other over they at first shrugged before smiling. “What the hell,” Claudia smirked. “This could be fun.”<br />
<br />
“She does have a point,” Samantha added. “This could be fun, plus I always wanted to see what Ashley and Jen looked like as six year olds.<br />
<br />
“Us!!! Oh Sammy I can’t wait to put you back in kindergarten.”<br />
<br />
“So were actually doing this,” Mary Elise said.<br />
<br />
“”Guess So,” Kellie smiled. “Only question is...who goes first?”</p>
