<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad&#39;s thigh burned.   The new Chad had emptied a syringe into it.  He blacked out. When he came to, Chicochad was naked, and his collar chained to the back of the kennel.  He had leather mitts on his hands, a chastity cage on his cock, and a rubber tail dildo shoved up his ass.  He started to call out, and got a major electric shock from the collar.  He looked out at the grinning jock that he had been.  He had a fitful sleep in the kennel.   He was cold and shivering when a stiff pain woke him.  His morning wood was trapped in a metal cage.  It was still dark.<br />
<br />
Chicochad stared at the dark wimpy arms in the dim light from the back porch, as he pushed his now tiny naked body up off the concrete.  He stared at his backyard through the kennel gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hel-!&quot; ZAP!  he started to speak, as was reminded of the electric collar.  It wasn&#39;t a normal electric collar, it was a suped up one.<br />
<br />
Chicochad awoke again when dawn&#39;s early light shone on him.  He stared at his backyard from the kennel.   The chain kept Chicochad from reaching the gate.  He was humiliated in a strange body. He sniffed his new hairy armpit, and crinkled his nose, Chico&#39;s body needed a bath.    He was trapped in the kennel, unable to speak without getting shocked into unconsciousness, and unable to do anything.  He had never felt so helpless.  There was nothing he could do, but stew and wait.<br />
<br />
It was nearly 9 am, when the new Chad sauntered out of the back door.  He was wearing his boxer briefs.  Somehow seeing his body half naked made puppy boy Chicochad feel more naked than ever.  The new Chad was exploring his new backyard,  There was a patio, a pool, a pool house with a workout room, and sauna, and there was jacuzzi and a garage with Chad&#39;s BMW motorcycle.  It was all his now, he was a rich bastard.  He grinned.  It was only when he noticed the open can of dog food in his hand that he remembered why he&#39;d come outside.  He started to laugh.  He walked over behind the garage where bushes obscured the kennel .  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Chico!&quot; Chad roared.<br />
<br />
Chicochad opened his mouth to speak, but thought better of it.<br />
<br />
Chad laughed, &quot;Good, puppy!  You&#39;re a fast learner. Well, I guess I should feed you.&quot;  He undid the padlock, opened the gate, and emptied the can of compressed meat and grain on to the concrete.  It landed with a splat in front of his new dog.<br />
<br />
Chicochad looked at him like he was crazy if he thought he would eat that.<br />
<br />
Chad just laughed, &quot;Now, Chico, I&#39;d eat that if I were you.  I picked this weekend because I knew you&#39;d be home alone, but I&#39;ll have to move you before your &#39;rents get back.  My uncle - your uncle has a junkyard, you&#39;d make a good junkyard dog.  But my boyfriend has a gay club, and a cute fuck puppy would be popular with his clientele.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chicochad&#39;s eyes widened in horror.  He got on his knees and raised his hands to beg Chad for his life back.  He seriously doubted that Chico could convince anyone he was Chad, but who would believe that the punk stole his body.  No, they&#39;d probably ship him off to a psychiatrist, and meanwhile, he cringed at the thought, he would be somebody&#39;s &quot;fuck puppy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, ain&#39;t that cute.  But no, Chico, you&#39;re Chico the dog boy now, get used to it.  I&#39;m the only Chad here.  Now eat your breakfast, then I&#39;ll take you walkies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad slammed the gate and sauntered back to the house.<br />
<br />
Chicochad&#39;s stomach growled.  Chico must&#39;ve not eaten for days, the bastard. Chicochad leaned over the dog food slop and sniffed.  He wasn&#39;t really thinking about eating it was he?  It smelled - well, not too disgusting.  He stuck out his tongue and tasted it.  He waited and resisted, but eventually, he ate it up.  He even licked the last bits off the concrete.  <br />
<br />
The sun was high overhead when Chad came out again.  He was naked this time, and sporting a boner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your old man, I mean daddy had some purple pills,&quot; Chad said with a wink.  &quot;But it takes a while for them to work, so, come on, puppy boy, come out of your kennel and poop on the grass.  I&#39;ve got a baggy to put it in.  Then I&#39;ll give you a bath inside and out, and then you&#39;ll begin earning your keep, bitch boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was lead out by the chain.  He attempted to break free, but  the Chico body was no match for the Chad body.  Chad pulled the butt plug tail out with a plopping noise, and Chicochad found his bowels grumbling. He was forced to squat, and poop.  At least it was somewhat gratifying that Chad had to pick it up when he was done.  Chicochad figured that Chico must&#39;ve eaten a lot two or three days ago, and then starved himself, and maybe kept the butt plug in his ass to make sure Chicochad would have a big humiliating shit.<br />
<br />
Then Chad hosed him down, and shoved it in his butt.  It wasn&#39;t high pressure, but it was more than an enema should be.  Soon Chicochad was sobbing, and Chad was rock hard.  Purple pills?  Oh, crap, thought Chicochad, he&#39;s going to make me his bitch boy now!  He was right.<br />
<br />
Chicochad really lamented being born with a big dick now, as it was  buried up to his pubes inside his new tiny ass.  Damn, he was fucking himself.  He had yelped in pain when he first entered himself.  Only after he was somewhat enured to the pain of  the flesh penetrating him and moving in and out, did Chicochad realize that he hadn&#39;t gotten shocked.  He could speak safely.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-s-s-o, Ch-ch-chico, y-y-you d-d-don&#39;t really think , you&#39;ll get away with this, d-d-d-d-oh-gawd,&quot; moaned Chicochad.  Chad slammed his cock all the way inside him, and Chad&#39;s big balls slapped hard against Chicochad&#39;s thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch boy, I know people who can remove your vocal chords. So, yes, I will get away with this.  The question is will you be a good fuck puppy, or do I have to make you a good fuck puppy by cutting your vocal chords and nuts off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chicochad&#39;s eyes widened more, he pleaded softly, &quot;No, Chico, please don&#39;t -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Chad now.  Call me Chad, Chico, understand?&quot; Chad said reaching between Chicochad&#39;s thighs, and twisting his nuts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeow!  Yes, yes, Chad, I understand!&quot; gasped Chicochad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good then no more words, bitch boy.  Now I&#39;m going to train you to obey commands.  Sit, rollover, suck cock, all the basics!&quot; laughed Chad.<br />
<br />
Chicochad was exhausted by late afternoon after being on all fours all day.  He played fetch with Chad.  He sucked cock repeatedly.  He was chained to a post in the backyard, while Chad swam in the pool.  Then he was put back in the kennel, and Chad made a point that Chicochad knew his collar was back on.<br />
<br />
Chicochad sobbed himself to sleep in the shade of the garage.  It was getting to be sunset, when Chad heard voices.  He rushed to the kennel gate.  It was Rick and Bruno with Chad.  They were all drinking beer.  Oh, his parents would kill him when they got home, thought Chicochad.<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway, I got us a sex puppy for tonight&#39;s party, &quot;Chad explained, &quot;And I&#39;ve invited every jock in the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No girls?&quot; lamented Rick unhappily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone will think you&#39;ve gone gay,&quot; giggled Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Chico, show my buddy Bruno how good you are at giving head now,&quot; Chad said.</p>
