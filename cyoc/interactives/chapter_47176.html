<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The energy he felt within him had slowed down, but it hadn’t dissipated.<br />
<br />
Guy could still feel himself growing, and he could see his muscles still swelling under his skin.  His gym clothes were incredibly tight on him, straining to contain his growing body, the seams slowly popping and tearing as he pumped up bigger, ever-larger.  He lumbered to the end of the locker aisle, his huge thighs rolling around each other, and looked around.  Although the locker room looked empty, he could hear a couple guys chatting a few aisles over, and someone was in the shower.<br />
<br />
Surely, someone would soon notice him.  He was growing too immense to hide!  He couldn’t hide in the locker room forever!  He had to get out of here!  He had to get back to his apartment!<br />
<br />
Guy returned to his locker and gathered his things.  He then left the locker room as quickly as he could, his thighs pressing against each other more and more as he walked, causing him to waddle.  He could feel his shorts straining to hold together, the seams on his seat tearing even more as his bubble-butt expanded, and the fabric rubbed together between his inner-thighs.  He could feel his triceps rub against his lats as his arms swayed, even though his arms stuck out over a 45-degree angle.  He stepped out and right away headed for the parking lot, people gawking as he passed.  Many loudly commented on his too-tight clothing, others pointed out his large bubble-butt, and others still commented on his muscle-gut and chest.<br />
<br />
Guy ignored them.  He hustled as quickly as he could across the parking lot and fumbled with the door lock of his car.  Once he got it, he clambered in.<br />
<br />
The seat of Guy’s shorts finally gave way, busting open as he sat down.  He cursed quietly and started the car.  He had an awkward time driving home, it was tough for him using the gas and break pedals; his thighs were fighting each other for space.  He could feel his hamstrings lifting his legs in the seat, while his growing quads pressed against the underside of the steering wheel, making it difficult to turn the wheel.  He was half-way home when his shorts started tearing along the sides, so enormous his thighs were growing.<br />
It was becoming quite the tight squeeze in his car.  His could feel his lats growing thicker, pressing into the backrest and spilling out to the sides, his shirt tearing down the back and around the armpits, forcing his arms upward, which made it uncomfortable to hold onto the steering wheel.  His biceps and pecs were expanding as well and started to press against each other, forcing him to hold tighter onto the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t adjust the seat.  Each time he tried, his chest would press against the steering wheel, honking the horn, and he couldn’t squeeze his thickening forearms between his swelling thighs to reach the lever.  The seams of his shirt were losing the fight to contain him, and the seams along the shoulders, collar, and sleeves started tearing open.  How big was he going to get?<br />
<br />
Guy cursed loudly.  “C’mon!  Just a little further...”<br />
<br />
He finally made it home, and hastily parked the car, nearly driving it over the curb.  He managed to squeeze himself out of the car and waddled up the walkway to his apartment.  Each step was difficult to take.  Looking down as he climbed the stairs, he could only see his growing chest.  So, with his swelling legs, he had to feel his way up each step, placing his feet uncertainly, and with a heavy thud.  Luckily, it was a short walkway, and he didn’t have far to climb.<br />
<br />
It was a lot of work for his still-growing body.  Guy was only half-way up the stairs when the last seams holding his shorts and shirt ripped.  His shorts hung off him like a loin cloth, hanging on only by the elastic band.  His shirt was falling off of him in patches, as his arms tearing the sleeves, his deltoids shredding the shoulders, and his lats and chest pulling the torso of the shirt apart.  His neck and traps were thickening even more, causing the collar of the shirt to tear under their rapid growth.  He was shirtless by the time he reached the top of the walkway.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily from the exertion, he reached the front door of his apartment, thankful for living on the first floor.  Fumbling for the keys, he managed to open the door and fall into the foyer with a heavy thud.  With great effort, Guy managed to pick himself up.  He lumbered into the kitchen and grabbed the wall phone.  He dialed a number and pinned the phone between his head and shoulder.  His shoulders we still growing, and with this thickening neck, he could no longer hold his head in that position like he used to; he nearly dropped the phone.  He then tried holding it to his ear while it still rang on the other line.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, pick up.  Pick up!”  Guy could feel his bicep pressing against his forearm, pushing the phone away from his ear.  He fought against it, but still his biceps and forearms grew.  He was losing the ability to bend his arms inward!  He continued resisting, growling in frustration.  “Pick up, God damn it!”<br />
<br />
“Hello?” a male voice answered at last on the other end.<br />
<br />
“Ryan!  Thank God you picked up!”  Guy exclaimed.  By now he was holding the phone a few inches away from his ear.  “I need your help—whoa!”<br />
<br />
Guy nearly lost his balance, stumbling, he had to widen his stance.  His quads and hamstrings were incredibly thick now.  Would he have to widen his stance again?<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?  Are you okay?”  Ryan asked, concerned.<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”  Guy laughed nervously; his bicep had pushed his forearm away further; the phone was now almost a foot away!  “You’d have to see it to believe it!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ryan replied cautiously.  “I’ll be there as soon as I can.”<br />
<br />
“Come quick!  Bring your van!”<br />
<br />
Ryan hung up.<br />
<br />
Guy struggled to place the phone back on the receiver.  His bicep pressed against his pec when he lifted his arm, and his shoulder bulged immensely, which hindered him greatly.  He waddled to the side and was able to hang the phone up.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Guy waddled into the living room, since there was a mural-mirror in there.  He swayed back and forth with each step he took; lifting his legs was becoming challenging.  He could feel his quads pressing against each other as he moved, pressing as well into his hips as he lifted his legs.  He could barely bend his legs, however, as his calves has grown so large, almost filling the back of his lower legs.  He entered the living room, and turned to face the mirror.<br />
<br />
He was amazed at how big he had become!  His muscles bulged everywhere, his muscular build becoming rounder and bulgier, as his muscles were running out of space to grow.  Each muscle group was growing and fighting for room on his limited frame.  He saw his shorts in tatters, and managed to tear them off.  He was only in his boxers, which were now starting to tear on him!  They rode up his thighs and made it look like he was wearing briefs, and his bubble-butt filled the seat incredibly, drawing the fabric tight across his crotch; he could feel the seams popping open.  His muscle-gut bowed outward, pushing the waistband of his boxers down closer to his crotch.<br />
<br />
His muscles bulged immensely, jostling at the slightest movement.  He struck a double biceps pose, and gasped at how huge they had become.  He couldn’t bend his arm inward past 90-degrees!  Relaxed, his arms bulged out to the sides, his triceps bulging over his elbows, and his biceps looked like they were resting in the crook of his arms.  He struck a front lat pose, but couldn’t bring his arms in to touch his waist, so wide his lats had grown.  He tried the side chest pose, but he couldn’t bring his left arm around to reach his right wrist, his chest and biceps got in each other’s way!  He wanted to see his back and ass, but as he shuffled around, he couldn’t look over his traps to see in the mirror!  He wobbled back around, and struck a “relaxed” pose, and was looking anything but!  He tried to perform the abdominal-thigh isolation pose; he couldn’t bend his arms up and back enough to reach his head, but he flexed anyway.  His muscle-gut was huge!  He could feel himself flexing, but it just didn’t look like it.  His quads jiggled as he flexed them; they hung off his legs like a engorged tear-drop, and they bulged out over his knees, almost obscuring them completely!<br />
<br />
He looked at the clock’s reflection in the mirror, wondering when his friend Ryan would arrive.<br />
<br />
He had to widen his stance again.<br />
<br />
He hoped his friend would get here soon!</p>
