<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cathy stood in Naomi's room and waited for her sister to return.  She stood completely motionless since at the moment it was not possible for her to move.  Instead she looked at the walls and the carpet and the ceiling before becoming bored.  It had been a normal day until she had come home and seen her sister turn into some sort of rubber girl.  The memory of Naomi being coated in the strange liquid was haunting to Cathy.  But that had been only the start of the weirdness.<br />
<br />
Cathy had come home from university for the weekend.  Officially to get some clean clothes and to spend some time with Naomi.  Secretly, Cathy was asked to come back to keep her sister from getting into trouble.  As Cathy listened to Naomi's story about revenge and magic, she wondered if she were ready for the weekend.  Naomi explained what had happened to her and her friend Jen in the bathroom and now they were going to have some fun.  The rules would be simple.  Use the magic only when asked and try to give what the other person wants.  It would be simple and everyone would be happy.  The possibilities were so numerous that Cathy's mind raced to grasp any single one at all.  But eventually she asked to join the game.<br />
<br />
Cathy could hear strange noises echoing from the bathroom.  Everything seemed to distorted from where she stood.  She wanted to go spy but walking was not possible.  Rolling maybe, but not by her own choice.  She wanted to call out and ask if everything was alright but that also was not possible; Cathy had no mouth.  So she waited and hoped that the young girls would not forget about her here, in the room, alone.  Thinking.<br />
<br />
She thought about how it was odd that she could still see.  After all her 'eyes' at the moment were simply painted on.  But she could still see all around her as if 'seeing' at the moment did not require the normal human vision system.  She had talked before to pass the curse back to Naomi, but had been unable to make any other noise since.  She was not even sure where her voice had come from before but was certain that if confronted with the curse again she would be able to participate.<br />
<br />
Feeling was something different.  All over her body Cathy could feel.  She could feel the soft carpet under her belly.  The slight draft wafting over her bare back side.  She could feel the crumpled and torn clothing she had been wearing before she had been transformed laying under her tail.  But most of all she could feel the afternoon sun peaking trough the window heating her gaseous insides.  And she swooned; feeling warm and safe.  She wondered if she she should just take a nap while she waited.  If only she could move down to the pool side and float on the cool water also.  That would be nice.  After a short time Cathy heard voices on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;... know she is studying psychology and sexuality at school?  Well she wondered if she could experience some of what she was researching.&quot;  Naomi's voice explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; said another girl.  Cathy guessed it was that of the friend Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she said that so few people actually know they have a kink, and since most keep it hidden from everybody, there is no data to study.  She wanted to do some first hand research to get a better insight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she decided to start with what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy watched the door swing open slowly.  Two figures stood looking in.  One the dark, glossy rubber figure that was her younger sister.  The other, a normal looking teen girl with her mouth hanging open.  Both dressed down as if for sleeping and lounging.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pool-toy.  Specifically, an orca.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi walked in and leaned against Cathy causing the air to redistribute.  For a moment Cathy was bent in two, her bulbous head rising off the floor a little.  Her rounded fins folded inward giving the impression that she was propping herself up to look directly at Jen.  The feeling of being sat on was new and comfortable.  Cathy felt a thrill to be moved, but her inability to do anything much more was getting boring.  If she could have Cathy would have raised her eye brows to get attention that she wanted to change back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does she want to be a pool-toy?&quot;  Jen said walking in to touch the taught vinyl skin that was Cathy's nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently people want to become pool-toys,&quot; Naomi explained.  Naomi straddled Cathy's back and rocked forward grabbing the two handles placed around the dorsal fin.  &quot;She just wanted to see if she could understand what the appeal was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get it,&quot; Jen said squishing the nose and letting it bounce back.  She caressed it and kissed it and a warmth seemed to spread through Cathy's body or mind making her feel happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Naomi said.  Slowly she started to bounce up and down on Cathy's back.<br />
<br />
Naomi's rubber legs squeaked as they slid over the plastic body of the toy that took up much of her room.  The rhythmic motions were starting to build in Cathy a feeling that was akin to arousal.  She tried to fight it.  She wanted to tell the girls to turn her back quick but she could do nothing.  Cathy was helpless as the two poked and prodded and played a little with her.  She was getting a little horny but could find no way to make it go faster or to make them stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I change her back?&quot; Jen asked.  &quot;We could leave her like this for the night and do it in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said she could join us, though,&quot; Naomi said.  Her bouncing was getting more vigorous and she was smiling a big toothy smile between pinched rubber cheeks.  &quot;This is fun, Jen.  You should take a ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well should I ask her?&quot;</p>
