<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adrian didn&#39;t know what to do. Instincts told him to run. He turned himself around. However, as he tried to run, he couldn&#39;t move. &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; Steve smirked. His finger hand made it&#39;s way into the collar of Adrian&#39;s shirt and that was more than enough to keep Adrian from running. <br />
<br />
With just a bit of a tug, Adrian was pulled back into Steve&#39;s body. A layer of sweat had covered the colossal man. Adrian barely came up to his pecs, and felt his face pulled into them. Adrian struggled against the strong grasp. It only drew a hearty chuckle out of Steve. &quot;Come on bro? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s struggle was in vain. He couldn&#39;t do anything against the growing giant. Another inch seemed to have added onto Steve and somehow his muscles only grew even more. Thick veins bulged out of his biceps and ran down his forearms. Steve&#39;s hands barely struggled against the full strength of Adrian&#39;s body. He couldn&#39;t do anything.<br />
<br />
Finally Adrian took a breath. In his struggle, he hadn&#39;t even realized he&#39;d stopped breathing. The strong musky smell of Steve fill his nose. He let out a moan as the smell entered inside him. The struggle instantly died as Adrian pressed his nose up against the sweaty pecs his face was being pushed up against. His mind went into a frenzy as the smell permeated his senses. He couldn&#39;t think about anything else.<br />
<br />
His struggle had changed. Pushing quickly changed to pulling as he buried his face into the massive pecs in front of him. He groped and clawed at the massive muscles. &quot;Oh God...&quot; he moaned deeply as the strong smell permeated his senses. Adrian&#39;s mind couldn&#39;t get enough of it. The sheer amount of bliss radiated through his body as his heart rate rose. Blood pumped faster through his body and he almost began humping the massive man holding him down against his body.<br />
<br />
Steve chuckled. His enormous hand grabbed the back of Adrian&#39;s head. He pulled the smaller man away, watching as Adrian struggled to get back in there, only to shove Adrian deep into his pit. Adrian&#39;s body clawed at Steve excitedly as his tongue lapped up the sweaty smelly cave under Steve&#39;s arm. He couldn&#39;t get enough of it.<br />
<br />
The sexual haze completely distracted Adrian. He didn&#39;t even notice as his average body begin to grow. His muscles were starting to swell bigger. Every second added another pound or two to his frame. Pure muscular strength filled every inch of him. Though his shoes were the first to burst. Without any give, the swelling size of his size ten feet rapidly grew far too large for their confines. His toes burst through the front while the rest of his foot crushed the sole of his shoe.<br />
<br />
It was barely even 30 seconds before his medium shirt began to tear. What had been straining against his growing belly, was now far too tight around his chest and shoulders. The sleeves rose up around his shoulders and then started to tear. The fabric of the shirt couldn&#39;t hold on. It could only stretch so far. The thickening of his pecs and widening of his shoulders were too much. Adrian flexed his body and a loud tear filled the building. He barely even realized as it tore away from him.<br />
<br />
Nor did Adrian realize that his khaki shorts were gone either. Even though his fat had disappeared down into the single digits, his pelvis bone had to grow to support his taller body. A little over half a foot added onto his frame, growing him to 6&#39;3&quot;. His arms had grown to 20 inches and a thick vein ran along the bicep. Lots of oxygen rich blood would have to supply the muscle to keep him strong. However, he was thoroughly disappointed as he was pulled out of Steve&#39;s pit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you!&quot; Steve praised Adrian&#39;s bodybuilder physique. At 6&#39;3&quot; and 250ish pounds Adrian could easily step on any stage and win first prize. Each and every muscle was beautifully on display. Perfectly sculpted abs ran down to his massive legs. There was no denying that he was massive. Even his calves were looked like massive diamonds. However, they barely compared to the now 7&#39;1&quot; Steve. His weight was probably incalculable on any standard piece of machinery. He was easily in the 400 pound range if not closing in or passing 500 pounds. His arms looked to be bigger than Adrian before any of the changes had started. Two massive pecs filled his front and he leaned back showing off everything.<br />
<br />
Adrian found himself distracted by the massive rod. Something far larger than he&#39;d ever imagined. However, his eyes couldn&#39;t look away. They didn&#39;t want to look away. Just seeing Steve&#39;s enormous hands stroke the steel pole send shives down his spine. His ass tingled with excitement. His mouth watered with anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Ey buddy, flex for me,&quot; Steve commanded. <br />
<br />
Instantly, Adrian went into a double bicep pose. His arms shot up and seemed to know exactly where to go to make his biceps look as big and round as they possibly could while also showing off his deeply cut abs. &quot;Another,&quot; Steve commanded. His stroking of his cock grew a bit faster. Adrian did as he was told, transferring his body into a side chest pose. He made sure to pop his chest and show off his quads and pecs. &quot;Oh fuck... An--nother...&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s stroking grew even faster. He was barely able to focus on what was going on. He just loved watching this muscular man pose for him. Even though he&#39;d dwarf Adrian in every way, watching Adrian pose was better than anything right now. Adrian smirked feeling like he could see the excitement in Steve&#39;s eyes as he watched him. Adrian spun around for a rear lat spread, but made sure to poke out his butt more than he should.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK!&quot; Steve cried out as he saw the underwear stretch and tear to reveal Adrian&#39;s hole. He couldn&#39;t hold on anymore and finished. Large globs of cum shot out of his dick and covered a lot of Adrian&#39;s body. Adrian couldn&#39;t contain himself either. He felt his dick throb and finish in the bare remnants of his underwear. &quot;&quot;Man little bud... You always look that damn good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian smiled widely at the compliment, however the two were distracted at the chime of the front door.</p>
