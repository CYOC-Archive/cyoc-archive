<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paula only talked with the reporter for a minute or so before she was rushed off in an ambulance. They rushed a ton of people into the hospital, which was already overwhelmed due to something else that had happened across town, meaning that the entire hospital was packed. As Paula was let in, they sat her down outside a ton of rooms with more serious cases from the bus. The bus&#39; derby had hit more people than the news initially anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now wait here please mam... I&#39;m sorry but we have a lot of people to help. We&#39;ll get someone in here to check on the baby as soon as we can.&quot; A nurse told her before rushing off to help others.<br />
<br />
Paula rubbed her stomach gently. She definitely wasn&#39;t pregnant before this, but now some sorry sap was unborn in her uterus. She looked around the hall, looking into rooms where people she had been staring it as potential targets were now heavily in pain. Guilt finally hit her as she began to tear up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;No this is no time to cry. I have the camera, and I can keep changing people until no one&#39;s life is in danger.&quot; <br />
She raised the camera and began to look around.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mitch was dying. He knew he was, he could feel it. Every ounce of his body was screaming in pain. He could see blood pouring from his twisted arm and more coming from his head. He could see his wife Bethany try to reach him but two large, buff security guards kept her at bay. The doctor began to sedate him, as Bethany walked away for a moment to try and breath. He almost could&#39;ve sworn he saw a light for a moment, but only briefly as the pain went away. It was over, she was done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Ms. Kylie,&quot; One of the two doctors who delivered Michelle&#39;s baby. &quot;it&#39;s a girl!&quot; She sighed in relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Michelle was able to mutter as she was given her baby girl. Her sister Bethany ran back in, and excitedly hugged her sister. Michelle felt like she was going to die, but she finally gave birth. If only it wasn&#39;t surrounded by so many rooms filled with death.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paula looked at the photo and thought she did a good job. The only thing that really sucked was the doctor who was now a new born, but is he, or she now, wanted to be a doctor again it was up to her when she grew up... again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Focus Paula.&quot; She thought. &quot;People are in trouble, you can fix stuff later.&quot; She thought as she moved to the next room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Angie was completely passed out. She had broken both of her legs, and she was losing blood fast. The two doctors working on her were struggling every second just to keep her alive. &quot;Johnson, hand me the scalpel!&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t have time dammit!&quot; &quot;Well make ti- hey!&quot; He yelled, suddenly noticed a woman with a camera. &quot;Get the damned press out of here!&quot; The older African American doctor yelled at his younger subordinate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lady get the he-&#39;m sorry but this isn&#39;t one of the crash victim rooms.&quot; The meekly blonde suddenly found herself saying. She could&#39;ve sworn she was a man a moment ago, but that thought soon faded along with the rest of her old life as only Karen remained. &quot;We&#39;re trying to say goodbye.&quot; She calmly explained before closing the door on Paula.<br />
<br />
Paula had only briefly been able to see, but was able to confirm it on her camera. The crash victim was now an old man, surrounded by family that was not there before. At first, Paula felt panicked, like she needed to barge in and stop him from dying. But, she had other people to save, and technically the man had lived a full life. <br />
<br />
<br />
Paula looked down the hall and saw plenty of other rooms to go for, but if the last person she saw was any indication, she didn&#39;t have much time. That&#39;s when an idea struck her. It was stupid, but it just might work. She tried her best to aim at the entire hallway, making sure to get every room that she hadn&#39;t changed yet. In a bright flash, the bustling hallway was now devoid of people, with only a few rooms filled.<br />
<br />
In one of the room&#39;s place, was a nursery. It was filled to the brim with new born babies, all crying and kicking up a fuss. She laughed at this, wondering what they had to fuss about. They had just been on the verge of death, but now they had a second chance at life. She figured that everyone she changed, at least other than the bus driver, were all in there too. The working girl, the odd couple, and even the latino maids were now infants again. No accident had ever happened, which Paula could feel as her cuts and bruises vanished.<br />
&quot;Well, good luck everyone.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Serves you right for taking public transportation&quot; She looked before walking away.<br />
<br />
As she walked down the hall, she caught a glimpse of the news report. Before, it had been a solemn broadcast, examining how such a deadly accident could have occurred. Now, however, it was very different. &quot;Hilarious news today,&quot; The woman started. &quot;as a pregnant woman was on a bus with a CAT, as the driver! Apparently, the woman had fallen asleep, and thinking everyone had gotten off, the driver left the bus alone with his cat to pee. The cat accidentally started the bus, and the rest was history. Luckily, the woman did not get seriously hurt. Now how the zoo&#39;s escaped aardvark got involved was a whole...&quot; The broadcaster continued to cornily explain as she flashed a picture of Paula.<br />
<br />
Paula was taken aback by the photo. She looked more like her mother than herself! &quot;Well, I guess being pregnant wasn&#39;t my only change.&quot; She thought rubbing my belly. &quot;That was more your change than mine right?&quot; She rhetorically asked the former passenger, now fetus. &quot;God, I must be what, 35, 40 now?&quot; She thought disappointed. &quot;Ugh, I&#39;m as old as mom!&quot; She internally cringed, thinking about being as old as her mother Rachael. &quot;If I see Emily before I change back, she&#39;s gonna have a field day with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat back down in the hallway and relaxed. Although she wasn&#39;t a fan of her current er conscience was clear and she could rest easy knowing nobody was going to die in agony. &quot;Oh shit, the old man! I completely forgot!&quot; She said as she forced her pregnant body to stand. As she did so...</p>
