<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was ultimately up relatively early, mostly as he continued to struggle with dreams and drifting thoughts that wrestled with just about everything in his past and who he was. He knew that he&#39;d have support in Moon Lake, in that Henry Jenkins had been supportive, as had Huck, and Jenny was very understanding. A part of him even added great appreciation in Ginger&#39;s understanding for things, but he was still wrestling with who he was and whether or not becoming a were was something he needed or wanted to do. A part of him felt Ginger made a good case for joining, but he knew that until John knew who HE was, he couldn&#39;t go any further. And the dreams he&#39;d been having didn&#39;t make things better.<br />
<br />
He slowly stumbled into the kitchen where he found Harry standing there at the coffee machine and watching the dark liquid drip into the pot that would the coffee. The warm beverage carried a strong scent and even John could smell it. As John looked to Harry, he noted that the youngest of Henry and Lisa Jenkins&#39; children was in a pair of jeans and socks, but had no shirt on. In this, John noted that Harry was fairly well toned as a werefox, even in his human form. His muscles were perfectly balanced and toned enough that he would look strong and attractive to any woman that saw him, sorta like the male models that some magazines had for either underwear or cologne/aftershave type products. What surprised John the most was that the first thing that went through his mind was, &quot;Ginger looks stronger than Harry does.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was a surprise, as it wasn&#39;t what he expected to think, partially as that sort of thing would be a given. The largest species of fox, the Red Fox was many times smaller and weaker than even the smallest sub-species of tiger, the Sumatran Tiger among the confirmed living tigers and the Javan Tiger if one believed some occasional claims of seeing a tiger on the island of Java. That only made him stop to rub his eyes as he tried to mentally process the thought that went through mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, John,&quot; Harry said to John as he turned to see the younger Harper rubbing his eyes at the moment, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked up to see Harry looking to him and nodded, &quot;Fairly well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry heard his voice trail off and he wondered if this was something related to what Jenny had told him about from her own sort of dreams, where she conversed with the other versions of herself and had told her that John might be gay or at least bi. It was something that he knew would be potentially troubling for John, but Harry couldn&#39;t say anything about it for fear of coming off as nosey or judgmental. If John wanted to share things with him, Harry figured it best to let John do so when he was ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I&#39;ve had some things on my mind,&quot; John said after a moment, deciding not to get into too much detail with Harry at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing too bad, I hope,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;You know that Jenny and I... my parents and Huck, too... we&#39;ll all do everything we can to make you feel welcome and at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and you&#39;ve all been great,&quot; John answered, &quot;I just have some things to go through...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would this be with regard to the Ginger O&#39;Toole Janice has teased you on a bit?&quot; Harry wondered, as he heard some footsteps and guessed that either his parents or Jenny was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be part of it... she is a good friend and I don&#39;t want to hurt her in anyway,&quot; John answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the O&#39;Tooles are good people,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;I remember they gave out good candy on Halloween when I was a kid...&quot;<br />
<br />
John saw a small smirk creep onto Harry&#39;s lips as he soon continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d think that Ginger would be a good friend for you,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;kind, intelligent, and fairly open...&quot;<br />
<br />
A thought then crossed John&#39;s mind and he couldn&#39;t help but voice it, &quot;What if she&#39;s to be more than friends... or wants to be? Could you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;d work?&quot; Harry finished, his face becoming a bit more serious as he saw his mother and Jenny come into the kitchen from behind John, &quot;that I can&#39;t say for certainty. A werefox&#39;s bond only really works with a pair that has felt they&#39;ve found their one true love  and it usually forms either after sex or after a fairly lengthy period of courtship. It&#39;s not something that either Jenny or I could use to say who is &quot;the one&quot; for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you want it to be a romantic relationship... making it work would be up to you,&quot; Jenny added as she gave John a small hug, &quot;make the choice to ask her out and treat her with kindness and respect. And if not... be honest and don&#39;t lead her along. Especially if you just want to be friends. And remember... John... we&#39;re ALL here to talk with you and help you with ANY problems you may have.&quot;<br />
<br />
John smiled at that and nodded. The smile was a bit on reflex but it could work with the fact that he was in a better place than where he was a week or so prior. He settled into breakfast, which Jenny brought to him while Harry and his parents shuffled around with some other projects for their own breakfast. So far Janice wasn&#39;t up yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what&#39;s got you up early?&quot; Jenny asked to him as she sat down at the small breakfast table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... as I told Harry... I had some things on my mind,&quot; John answered, &quot;and it&#39;s probably a good thing I&#39;m up... Ginger loaned me a book she got from the school library... however, she has to return it this morning and thus I have to return it to her before she goes to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that that rule book on chess that I saw you with last night?&quot; Henry Jenkins wondered as he got out a frying pan to start cooking some eggs from an upper cabinet.<br />
<br />
With his mouth full of cereal, John could only nod. Thankfully, the Jenkins family patriarch was looking in his direction. John finished chewing and then swallowed the cereal before he answered vocally.<br />
<br />
&quot;She also got me a travel chess set,&quot; John added, &quot;the game seems kinda fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very fun if you&#39;re into thinking games and strategy,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;played a little in college... but I was never any good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m very good either...&quot; John said slowly, &quot;but Ginger has been quite willing to teach and be friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded, though there was some knowledge that there was some sense that Ginger was more than a friend, or at least potentially more than a friend. This could be either that John had interest in Ginger that went beyond basic friendship or that Ginger had some romantic interest in John. From there, things would be up to John to make the decision on whether to go forward with that regard. From what John had already told him, Henry figured that might take some time as he tried to answer his own issues, which could be tough, particularly given what John had had to live under in Alabama. He had the sense that Harry and Jenny understood at least some of what John had told Henry, but like Henry or any of the other people that John had talked to, they could only provide general guides and assurances of acceptance. In that, Henry wasn&#39;t sure on what more could be done without professional help or open coaching that might help John make that choice... but they weren&#39;t ready for that, yet.<br />
<br />
However, John did seem a bit calmer with things and more open to talking, which Henry took as a good sign. That let things go through the morning while Harry and Jenny got ready for their college day. Janice was up by seven thirty and joined John for breakfast with some friendly questions on his night and his dreams, though before John could answer, Janice went into some excitement on being a weremermaid and singing &quot;under the sea&quot; with various fishes. It was something that provided a few chuckles as Jenny and Harry then made their way out for the college and dealing with their Tuesday/Thursday classes. It was at seven forty-five that a knock at the door alerted John.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably Ginger,&quot; John spoke as he slid his chair back and made a quick dash from the kitchen to the living room, collecting the library book that Ginger had lent him from the couch as he made his way to the front door. For the moment he ignored Janice urging him to say hello for her. After all, Ginger had school to get to and he and Janice couldn&#39;t go until things were completed in Alabama. He answered the door to find Ginger standing there quietly, though with her brother behind her and looking rather nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;re going to be late and in even more trouble with mom,&quot; Fred commented nervously, turning his head as if to look toward where the O&#39;Toole&#39;s house was rather than to the person who&#39;d just answered the door.<br />
<br />
Ginger ignored her brother&#39;s complaint. Her mom was concerned, largely in relation to the fact that she&#39;d heard plenty about the &quot;Harpers&quot; before Halloween and about the only one she&#39;d easily trust was Jenny Harper, and that had more to do with Jenny being clawed by Yvette Smith and thus being a were already. However, Ginger assured her mother that John wasn&#39;t like the rumors that had gone on about James Harper Senior and was also the sort that needed love, friendship, and a welcome feeling given all that he&#39;d been through. Her mother accepted it, but also gave the warning that she wasn&#39;t to take advantage of him or get seriously involved in ANY way until after John Harper met them face to face. For the moment, that was okay, as John was still getting used to things in Moon Lake and was wrestling with his own identity. Ginger saw no need to get into that with John at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just picking up a book,&quot; Ginger gave an irritated growl to her brother before turning back to John with her face brightening, particularly when she saw him smile. &quot;Hi, John, sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About as well as I can... though... I&#39;ve still had a lot on my mind,&quot; John answered and then held out the book that Ginger loaned him, &quot;I did get through the book you loaned me, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Ginger smiled back, &quot;Did you hear anything... on...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My elder sister and her husband didn&#39;t hear anything special last night or evening,&quot; John answered, &quot;So... I&#39;m still waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Ginger, we&#39;ll be late!&quot; Fred urged, tugging on Ginger&#39;s back shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t stay long right now... school, you know?&quot; Ginger chuckled as she took the book that she&#39;d borrowed from the school library and held it tightly, while keeping her eyes focused on John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know, see you after school?&quot; John wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ginger smiled back and waved to John as she and her brother began to make their way back up the street that they always took to school. As they made their way to the road that curved in a slightly northward direction from the Jenkins house and would take them to the High School, Ginger also heard John call after her that Janice said, &quot;Hi.&quot; Ginger gave a small chuckle and waved to him before continuing on her way, noting the small smile John still had.</p>
