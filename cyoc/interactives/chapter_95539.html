<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three of you continue your road trip through the countryside.  You admire the hills covered with trees and the purple mountains off in the distance.  You sit in the passenger seat next to Colby, giving George and his new, muscular frame the entire second row.  Since leaving the rest stop, you&#39;ve systematically gone through each of your sugar-filled delights, ripping open their packaging and devouring the contents.<br />
<br />
George gives you an awkward glance with his perfect eyebrows and brilliantly blue eyes.  &quot;Geez, man.  Are you starving or something?  We can stop for lunch if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head, licking some errant chocolate off your fingers from your freshly killed Ho-Ho.  &quot;Only if you guys want.  I think my dad has one hell of a sweet tooth.  He&#39;s just always restrained himself before.&quot;  You relax into your seat, empty wrappers strewn all over your lap.  &quot;But this summer is all about no restraints.&quot;  You sift through the plastic pile and find an unopened back of cookies.<br />
<br />
Colby gives you a sideways glance, the crow’s feet around his eyes wrinkling.  &quot;You&#39;re going to make yourself sick, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No restraints!&quot;  You practically pour the back of small cookies into your mouth.  You almost immediately regret it as the tiny crumbs fall into the back of your throat making you hack and cough.  George and Colby find this hilarious.<br />
<br />
After George collects himself and it&#39;s established you aren&#39;t choking to death, he reaches over the back seat begins fiddling with the blanket covering Colby&#39;s stash of beer.  &quot;Speaking of &#39;no restraints,&#39; what say we crack a few of these babies open?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby snaps his fingers and points at George like a parent might to a misbehaving child.  &quot;Don&#39;t you dare!  Put those back!&quot;<br />
<br />
George gives a perfect smile as he pulls out two cans of beer, still unopened.  &quot;Oh, come on, old man.  Lighten up.  Just a couple of me and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Colby barks.  &quot;It is illegal to have opened containers when somebody is driving.  If a cop sees what we&#39;re doing we could get pulled over.  And, just for the record, I may look like your uncle, but I don&#39;t have his driver&#39;s license.  And if we all get arrested, chances are his dad will hear about it, seeing as he looks like him and all.  Then would you like to explain to everyone how we deceived them so we could impersonate them and go on a summer-long trip unsupervised?&quot;<br />
<br />
George huffs petulantly and puts the two cans back where they came from.  &quot;Alright, alright.  I just thought...&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby looks apologetically through the rear-view mirror at George.  &quot;Listen, when we get to the cabin, anything goes.  But not while I&#39;m driving, Georgie.  Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of you sit in awkward silence for a few minutes before Colby changes lanes and onto an exit ramp.<br />
<br />
You glance at Colby, not remembering this part of the route.  &quot;Where are we going?&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiles at you.  &quot;What?  I thought you guys might like some lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After some hunting, you guys pull into a Mickey-D&#39;s drive-through, not wanting to waste time walking in.  You each order your food; a wrap for George, chicken nuggets for Colby, and a double-layer bacon cheeseburger with a large side of fries for you.<br />
<br />
After placing your order you get another awkward glance from George.  &quot;Do you seriously still have room for all that?  How are you even still hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
You did feel a little full from all the junk food, of which you&#39;d eaten about two thirds, but then again...  &quot;No restraints, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
George rolls his eyes.  &quot;Almost no restraints,&quot; he mumbles.<br />
<br />
You eventually receive your respective meals and set off down the road again.  You unwrap your latest prize, the extra-large burger leaking cheese, grease, and ketchup back into its packaging.  George leans in to gaze upon the soggy mass that was called a &quot;cheeseburger.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks up at you incredulously.  &quot;I bet you ten bucks that you can&#39;t eat the whole thing in one sitting.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smirk back at him.  &quot;I bet you twenty I can eat this AND the fries.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flashes his perfectly straight, perfectly white teeth in a grin.  &quot;You&#39;re on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby rolls his eyes as you shove the greasy mess into your mouth, taking a bite from its cheesy, bacony mass.  It tastes amazing.  You&#39;ve never quite eaten anything quite like it.  You take several more greedy bites of the sandwich.  You stop partway through.  Something doesn&#39;t feel right.<br />
<br />
George laughs.  &quot;Oh, man!  I think he&#39;s going to throw up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby grimaces.  &quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
You reach down and unfasten the button of your jeans, giving your bloated stomach some room.  The pressure relieved, you return to your sandwich.  After a few more bites the mass of fat and grease is gone.<br />
<br />
George lifts a sculpted eyebrow at you.  &quot;And now the fries...&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod.  You&#39;re feeling quite full, your stomach bloated with too much food.  &quot;Easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five at a time, the fries disappear into your mouth.  You&#39;re about halfway through when you feel pressure of a different kind build up.  You put a hand to your mouth, dreading the inevitable.<br />
<br />
George dives behind Colby&#39;s seat, laughing.  &quot;He&#39;s gonna blow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby winces and leans away from you as far as he can, while still maintaining control of the vehicle.  &quot;Oh my God!&quot;<br />
<br />
You let loose an impressive belch, something which you&#39;d only thought your father was capable of.  Well, you were practically him, now, so it made sense.<br />
<br />
Seeing as gas was the only thing to escape your mouth, Colby leans back into his normal position, looking a little flustered.  &quot;You guys are pigs.&quot;<br />
<br />
George sits back up as well, looking a little disappointed.<br />
<br />
With a grin, you pop the last few fries into your mouth.  With the food gone, you put both your hands up, signifying your victory.<br />
<br />
George shakes his head.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe it.  Man, your dad is a human garbage compactor.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grin.  &quot;And now I am, too.&quot;  You sigh in relief and lean your chair back, one hand on your painfully overfed stomach.  <br />
<br />
George dangles a 20 dollar bill in front of your face.  &quot;You earned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pocket your reward and close your eyes.  &quot;If you guys don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to sleep this off.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The trip is long, even with Colby&#39;s shortcuts.  Six hours after lunch, you go through another drive-through to grab a quick dinner.  By that point you actually do start feeling sick to your stomach, to which you get an &quot;I told you so&quot; from Colby.  You still manage to gulp down a small cheeseburger, to George&#39;s surprise, and the trip continues uneventfully.  The vehicle winds through the hills and begins its trip up into the mountains.  You were drawing close as you pass by tall evergreens and rocky hillscapes.  You were in the wilderness, now.  George says there isn&#39;t another town for about an hour.  You would be at his uncle&#39;s cabin in a matter of minutes.<br />
<br />
You sit up in your seat, feeling nauseous.  Your overfilled gut protrudes uncomfortably over your unbuttoned pants.  You&#39;re beginning to regret eating all that junkfood.  You suppress an urp as Colby pulls in to what looks like a dirt driveway.  You see ahead of you a large wooden building.  It&#39;s two stories and about a hundred feet long, possibly 50 feet wide.  It&#39;s hard to tell through all the trees.  It has an enormous patio off one side and large, ceiling to floor windows on one of the corners of the upper floors.<br />
<br />
You gape up at it.  You were expecting a small, wooden shack.  This was no cabin at all.  This was some sort of mansion!  &quot;It&#39;s huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
George and Colby glance at you.  Colby then smirks.  &quot;Oh, I guess you&#39;re the only one, now who hasn&#39;t seen it up to this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
George shoots Colby a look.  &quot;Wait, when did you see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby grins and taps his head.  &quot;I have your uncle&#39;s memories, remember?  I saw in my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
He parks the SUV in front of the large &quot;cabin&quot; and frowns.<br />
<br />
George looks between Colby and the cabin.  &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby points at one of the windows on the first floor.  &quot;As your uncle, I don&#39;t remember leaving lights on in the cabin when nobody&#39;s supposed to be around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, you can see yellow light spilling out of the window into the open night.  &quot;You think somebody&#39;s inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
George grunts.  &quot;Only one way to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of you cautiously exit the vehicle, your stomach painfully protesting as you do so.  You ignore it and grab a metal pole that had been lodged into the ground, possibly to hold a lantern at one point, but now stands empty.  George assumes some sort of fighting pose.  Colby creeps up to the front door and places one hand on the doorknob.  He slowly twists it, finding it unlocked.  He looks up at the two of you.  He holds up five fingers, and then proceeds to count down.<br />
<br />
Four, three, two, one!<br />
<br />
The three of you barge into the building, only to find...</p>
