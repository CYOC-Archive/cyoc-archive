<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to stay at Artur&#39;s hut for awhile. It&#39;ll be nice to be with someone your age and have someone to talk to. You&#39;re grateful for everything he&#39;s done too so you don&#39;t wanna be rude.<br />
<br />
Inside the hut is a luxurious-but-short log cabin. It feels like home and is nothing like what you expected. Artur shows you through the various rooms as you go deeper and deeper into the cabin. The main room is apparently at the very center and you find Colton sitting at a table reading there. He doesn&#39;t look up when his dad enters the room. Once you come in he stops and stares at you. You do the same.<br />
<br />
Colton definitely takes after his dad. He&#39;s not wearing a shirt and though he&#39;s your age his muscles are like a junior bodybuilder or something. His face is softer than his father&#39;s though. It&#39;s more angular and defined rather than strong. And you can&#39;t imagine him looking angry or mean. His eyes are a deep blue too. They&#39;re very different from his black hair and tail but it works with his palomino coat. His long black hair that frames his face and falls to his shoulders reminds you of a rock star.<br />
<br />
Artur introduces you and Colton stands up. He&#39;s slightly taller than you but not as tall as his dad. &quot;Nice to meet you, ,&quot; he says as he shakes your hand. You see his eyes twinkle and feel yourself blush.<br />
<br />
Colton&#39;s dad explains what Selina did to you. Colton doesn&#39;t get angry like his dad does though. He looks concerned and sympathetic. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; he says once his dad is done. &quot;That&#39;s awful. Well, don&#39;t worry, me and my dad will help you with everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thanks,&quot; you mutter, looking away from Colton. You don&#39;t know why you feel very hot with him so close to you. He doesn&#39;t seem to notice and just smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You boys have fun. I&#39;m going to go talk to Kasia,&quot; Artur says. He&#39;s smirking as he makes his way back out.<br />
<br />
Once Artur is gone Colton smiles at you. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got a lot of questions about everything. But you&#39;ve had a long day so I don&#39;t blame you if you just want to lie down and try to unwind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I want to lay down,&quot; you say, feeling your face go red. Why is that so embarrassing and why do you feel so hot? Colton smirks and shows you to a bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my room, but you can have the bed.&quot; The bed is a giant mattress in the corner bigger than anything you&#39;ve ever seen. Colton gestures to it with his arm but you just stand there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, I don&#39;t know how centaurs lie down,&quot; you mumble. Colton giggles at that and your heart skips a beat. It wasn&#39;t what you expected his laugh to sound like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I&#39;ll show you.&quot; Colton takes you by the hand and guides you to the bed. &quot;Just do exactly what I do.&quot; He turns so he&#39;s standing next to you and lowers himself onto his front knees. You do the same but it&#39;s uncomfortable. He then lowers himself onto his back knees so his legs are tucked under him with his tail out at the side. You do the same but you don&#39;t know how to get on the mattress. Colton grins with mischief and pulls you as he rolls onto the mattress. You roll with him and instinctively kick out your legs. Colton laughs as your roll finishes and you&#39;re right against him on the bed. &quot;No need to be so dramatic!&quot; he laughs.<br />
<br />
You blush and look away from him. &quot;I thought I was going to fall.&quot; You don&#39;t want to tell him how nice it feels being nuzzled against him and you try to keep the human half of your body away from his.<br />
<br />
Colton puts his hand on your cheek. &quot;You&#39;re fine. Hey, look at me, you&#39;re fine.&quot; When you look into his eyes you find him smiling at you. Not mean but caringly. He pulls you into a hug. His chest is nice and warm. &quot;It&#39;s going to be okay.&quot; Before you know what&#39;s happening he leans down and kisses your forehead. You hug him and start to cry. Everything that happened is going through your head. And you don&#39;t know why you feel so good with him. And you&#39;re realizing that everything&#39;s gone wrong now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Colton says. He runs a hand through your hair as he holds you. &quot;There, there, let it out. It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re fine. I&#39;m here.&quot; He kisses your head again as you sob into his chest. You don&#39;t realize he&#39;s leaning down to kiss your head again when you stop crying so you look up and he winds up kissing you on the lips. It takes him a moment to open his eyes and pull back. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot;<br />
<br />
You pull him down back into the kiss. You&#39;re still feeling warm and you realize something is slapping against your belly. But when you break the kiss there&#39;s nothing there. Colton is panting and smirking. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad I was right,&quot; he says to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right about what?&quot;<br />
<br />
He points at your horse half and you follow his finger. Your horse cock is slapping against your barrel. The sensation is weird because it feels like that&#39;s where your belly should be. But you realize how big you are now and your eyes go wide. &quot;Holy shit I&#39;m hung like a horse.&quot; Colton laughs at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ve been showing that off since you set eyes on me,&quot; Colton says teasingly. &quot;Lucky for you I think you&#39;re hot too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to him. Wait, no, you&#39;re straight! You got into this mess because you were trying to go out with Selina. The thought of her tits makes your eyes lose focus a little until Colton kisses you again. Fuck Selina, you want Colton right now!<br />
<br />
Colton makes out with you more for a few minutes before stopping and getting up. &quot;We can&#39;t do this in here, let&#39;s go to the mating room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mating room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s got the plumbing for us to clean up after. Trust me, centaur spunk is messy!&quot; Colton brings you to the room and stands above a big grate. You stand there not knowing what to do. &quot;Well, don&#39;t you want to have sex with me?&quot; Colton asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I want to keep kissing you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colton walks over and hugs you. He kisses you deeply and guides you so that you&#39;re standing next to him. &quot;We&#39;re a lot more flexible than humans,&quot; he says as he helps guide you to mount him. Once you&#39;re on top of him, he turns and keeps kissing you. He encourages you as he lifts his tail to expose his butt. You slide your dick in and gasp at the new sensations. Colton smiles as he kisses you and tells you how to buck and thrust. You moan into the kiss as you fuck him slowly then quick and hard then slow again. When you come it&#39;s the best orgasm of your entire life. All worries about being a centaur fade away as you bask in the afterglow without puling out. But then you squeal as you feel yourself getting hard again after just a few minutes. &quot;We&#39;ve got a lot more stamina too,&quot; Colton says seductively. You hope Artur is going to be gone for a long while. Whatever happens next, you&#39;re happy you decided to meet Colton.</p>
