<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(M/F because of cross-pleasuring.)<br />
<br />
John shook her head and said,&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just that....we don&#39;t know each other to that extent yet. But if you want you can help yourself to the other parts of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur pauses for a moment then chuckles and nods to John and says,&quot;My lady, you have been eying me for the entire trip up until now. True to your kind, you are honorable and you just aren&#39;t sure yet. Understandable, considering the history of my species, but you flatter me by your generosity towards me, especially considering the past conflicts between our species.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushes and bit her lip, feeling tempted to mention her ignorance towards the issue that the minotaur spoke of. Suddenly the minitaur put one of his muscular arms over her shoulder and she could feel his muscular body and she blushed. The minotaur let out a chuckle then said,&quot;Why don&#39;t I be nice to you here, you liked the feel of my sheath. It felt nice to have it touched by a female being other than my mother when I was a wee calf being bathed. Feel free to lay that bow and quiver down for now, if anything happens I&#39;ll protect you both in the name of Lilith, mother to us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused for a moment then nodded, and pulled her bow and quiver over her head and lied both on the ground to the opposite side that the minotaur was sitting at. The minotaur then moved closer to John, and he turned to face her, then he ran his hand down her back, and across the horse section of her body. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are tense it seems dear, do you have anything on your mind that you feel comfortable to tell me?&quot; The minotaur asked<br />
<br />
John blushed looking down at the minotaur&#39;s loincloth, and his sheath than hung out underneath of it. Then she looked over to Aaron and sighed,&quot;How....familiar are you with humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded and said,&quot;Ah, I see you must have experience directly with them, oddly part of your race finds the need to ally with them, while others wish to wage war with them. I personally have minimal experience with humans, other than the stories that I heard as a calf. They aren&#39;t very tough alone, but they populate this world more than any of us. I wonder, where do you stand amongst your kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused feeling pressured then she said,&quot;I...I...uh, neutral I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur paused then cocked his head to the side and asked,&quot;Neutral?&quot;<br />
<br />
John hesitated then said,&quot;W....well I don&#39;t exactly like them, but I don&#39;t hate them either. Like I would definitely fight against them, but....if I found a rather young one lost and afraid then....I feel as if I should aide them, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded then pet John along her equine half then said,&quot;I see where you are coming from, but I fear if a human were to come into contact with me or even your sultry friend here, I feel that they would just run afraid or attack on instinct. It&#39;s interesting in a way to hear someone&#39;s views such as your own, any particular reason why you would aide them?&quot; The minotaur began massaging John&#39;s equine part.<br />
<br />
John sighed and said,&quot;I guess....it&#39;s just think that if it&#39;s a young one then they would be more innocent. They wouldn&#39;t have done what humanity has done, or if they have they wouldn&#39;t be aware of it yet. I just think they can change.&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded,&quot;I see your reasoning, all things have feelings in this world, at bare minimum pain. But your kind and mine do have a common root that proves how diverse humans are in terms of emotions, we are both part human. Tell me miss...what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
John shuddered a bit, if she told the minotaur her real name then he would know something was up, so she just said the first thing that came to mind in terms of a name,&quot;J...Janice....&quot; <br />
<br />
The minotaur paused then said,&quot;Heh, sorry about that I must&#39;ve hit a knot. So Janice right? What a nice and mellow name, mine is Garret.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused for a moment then smiled and put her hand on Garret&#39;s arm and said,&quot;It&#39;s fine, pleased to meet you Garret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garret smiled and took her hand that was on his arm and kissed it then said,&quot;No, believe me the pleasure is all mine. To find such a beautiful mare such as yourself is rare on its own, but you have taken an interest in me. It would be rather rude of me to not allow you to have some fun with me as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushed again flattered then turned to Aaron who was still fast asleep in her coiled tail. John then smiled and ran her hand along Garret&#39;s chiseled abs, and she blushed. Garret smiled and said,&quot;You certainly like my physique. Yours isn&#39;t have bad either, such wide hips at the end of your human torso, a nice large equine ass complete with a beautifully groomed tail. Your breasts are nice too, nice and large for feeding future young. Your skin is nice and soft, and your eyes are like stars in the sky.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused wondering if she should be flattered or afraid by Garret&#39;s comments still blushing of course. Garret then moved his starting at John&#39;s lower human torso, and made his way up to caress her sensitive breasts. John blushed then Garret squeezed one if her breasts gently and she felt a strong surge of pleasure. Garret then smiled and asked,&quot;Mind if I give one of your nipples a pinch, it will hurt but only briefly.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushed and nodded and she grinned,&quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot; <br />
<br />
Garret nodded then moved to her nipple, then pinched John&#39;s teat causing her to moan loudly. It was then it hit John, this wasn&#39;t a dream at all, feeling Garret pinch her nipple hurt, even though it was mostly pleasant. Aaron suddenly woke up from her sleep and looked up at John and Garret then paused staring for a fee moments then spoke up,&quot;Sssssso, issss there ssssomething going on between the two of you or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
John almost jumped seeing Aaron awake, and she stood up and said,&quot;Um...n...no we were just....uh....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mingling,&quot; Garret interrupted and Aaron turned to him then John and said,&quot;Well I feel like we can talk about thissss later. Ssssso, what ssssshal we do now? I feel well ressssted after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garret nodded and said,&quot;Your kind is nocturnal, like most snakes are. I wouldn&#39;t imagine that you would sleep long anyways, perhaps you could take watch, or hunt while Janice rests a bit, with me with you? Then I will rest and she watches with you afterwards, and we leave at dawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron shot a look at John then nodded to Garret and said,&quot;Sssssure, I would wisssssh to have a talk with her before anything happenssss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garret nodded and walked away from them taking a long log from the fire to use it like a torch, and he walked away. Aaron then slithered over to John and said,&quot;John, what the hell are you doing.&quot; Aaron was pissed, but she kept her voice down trying not to have herself heard by Garret.<br />
<br />
John then gave Garret a puzzled look and said,&quot;What Aaron? He&#39;s nice, muscular and....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He wassss groping your boobssss, and don&#39;t you think I didn&#39;t sssssee you touch hissss cock back there.&quot; Aaron said annoyed<br />
<br />
John paused then said,&quot;Okay okay, we like each other is all. It&#39;s too early for assumptions though Ashley so calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron paused her jaw hanging open, then she hissed,&quot;Asssshly? What the hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
John covered Aaron&#39;s mouth careful of the lamia&#39;s fangs, then shooshed her and said,&quot;Garret could hear you okay, be quiet alright? Things....happened, nothing too serious for the time being. But don&#39;t be mad about the name, I call myself Janice now and I think that you should have a female name too or else we could raise suspicion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron opened her mouth to speak then sighed,&quot;Your right, jussst let&#39;ssss hope that he doessssn&#39;t come onto you.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused then said,&quot;I&#39;m sure you can find a nice manly naga, or reptile out there for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron blushed for a moment glared at John then said,&quot;Get ssssome ssssleeep, we&#39;ll talk about thisssss later.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sighed then lied down next to the fire, and slowly dozed off to sleep. Before she knew it she was being awoken by Garreth, and the first thing she noticed was that Aaron was standing with a new creature, a reptilian creature, a muscular male.....</p>
