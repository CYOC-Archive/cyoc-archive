<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;To be honest, I feel stronger then I've ever felt before,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Indeed, his muscles do seem bigger and even his skin seems more toned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, touch them. It's okay,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
You risk a touch and indeed, he does feel strong. Then he looks between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at how big my dick is now,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean, just look at it. Most guys would kill to have one this size.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabs it and begins massaging it with his eyes closed. The grey fur on his chest expands and the muscles in his arms seem to get larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run if you want,&quot; he says. &quot;Back home, no one ever let me do these things. Everyone always judged me! I couldn't be myself! Now I'm strong. This is what I want!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you cry. &quot;That's the hormones talking. What do *you* want?&quot;<br />
<br />
The grey fur on his chest is soon thick enough that you can barely see skin and now the fur is spreading down his arms. His face is starting growing longer and you watch as he seems to get taller but is actually standing on tip toes as his feet begin the journey into hoofdom.<br />
<br />
&quot;*This* is what I want,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to be strong and free of inhibition and stupid rules and taboos!&quot;<br />
<br />
He lets out a loud bray as his manhood gets even longer and begins to deform into a form that a jenny would desire but you're unsure (female feelings making you attracted to guys or not) you could ever desire to have on or in you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, please stop before it's too late,&quot; you cry. &quot;You don't want to be a beast! It can't be what you want!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just me do this. It's what I want. I can already feel it. You've got to experience this! It feels wonderful,&quot; he says. &quot;Please, be my jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have to back up as his chest barrels forward while his hands form into hooves. He falls forward as his face grows longer as his human hair falls out all while a mane grows in. All the while he brays excitedly.<br />
<br />
However, he stops braying for one moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I get it,&quot; he says. His voice is deeper and you have to admit, he sounds sexy to you. &quot;If we go willingly, we get to stay us and can still speak. I remember, I'm still me. Come on, be my Jenny!&quot;<br />
<br />
His body begins emitting a strong odour as he blinks and brays some more all while the fur creeps over the rest of his body. His face, hands and feet finish changing and his belly takes on a look only an equine could have.<br />
<br />
It seems to be done. He now stands before you as a donkey jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he cries.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Why did you do this to yourself?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so strong,&quot; he says. &quot;I could pull anything. Back there, oh man, I feel like I could please any Jenny. Come on, become my Jenny and I'll show you thing you wouldn't have dreamt of even in your wildest dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
You back off but feel a warmth go through you just before you feel a strong urge to stand on your tiptoes. You cannot resist the urge and follow it. Hoping against hope, you look down and feel despair at seeing your toes growing dark as grey fur starts growing on your ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, hurry,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; you say. Then an adventurous thought hits you. &quot;Can *you* do it to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He brays and smiles a goofy but cute smile only a donkey can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give me the wood er word,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
You turn around, kneel on your hands and knees and point your rear end at the apparently sentient donkey that was a human male minutes ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't hurt me will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never hurt my jenny,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
He's on you within moments. He's heavy and smells terrible but you feel a warmth from him. Then he enters you. He does it with the precision of someone that's done it a thousand times before. He's a gentleman and knows just how far to go without hurting you but to also give you pleasure that leaves you of two minds.<br />
<br />
One one side, this is a terrible betrayal of your manhood and humanity. On the other, it feels wonderful. The idea of being an animal but the process that turns you into one allowing you to retrain your human will, intelligence and even speech has an appeal that's difficult to deny.<br />
<br />
Your skin tingles and itches and you can't help but let out couple of brays.<br />
<br />
You feel your body growing larger as your belly and ribcage begin ballooning out and your hips widen and move to sides of your torso. He's able to move closer to you, your size allowing him to probe deer into you. Your legs change and your increasing size allow you to stand up and you take a deep breath as he's able to fully penetrate you.<br />
<br />
His scent no longer offends you. In fact, you start realizing how wonderful he smells.<br />
<br />
You let out several brays and close your eyes as you feel a pressure on your face.<br />
<br />
Then he releases his load into you as you feel yourself climax as a female for the first time in your life. <br />
<br />
You may have been born a human male and doing such an act is a betryal of everything nature started you out with but that moment is so wonderful that you don't care.<br />
<br />
You've never thought much of the nature of your existence but in the moments after he withdraws from you and you stand now as a donkey jenny, you wonder where the line between what you are ends and who you are begins.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was wonderful,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, actually, it was,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I guess this makes you an official female,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
You gasp. &quot;How did you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same way I knew that becoming this way willingly would let me stay sane,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, doesn't it bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shakes his head. &quot;We can still be friends. If we were both jacks, we'd compete and stuff. Now, I don't have to worry about seeking a mate and you don't either. We have each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right. But, when I was still human, I was doing all that stuff to you and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you told me, I'd have freaked out. But now I feel, I dunno, different about it. Well, why did you do it?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, I guess I just thought of what I'd want the naked woman before me to do and wanted you to have some fun. A part of me was curious too. I guess they made me like boys when they turned me into a girl. But I feel like I used you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun for me and I did this to myself,&quot; he says. &quot;You tried to stop me. I'm glad you didn't. Man, I feel so strong and free. And, don't take this the wrong way but you were wonderful. You knew just how to make me feel great. I mean, I like girls and all, but you were something else. It should have felt wrong, but with you, it just didn't; it felt okay to enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess it wasn't so bad. Even *I* feel stronger,&quot; you say. &quot;I can get used to being the girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walks beside you and nuzzles you. &quot;And don't worry, I won't take advantage of you. You're special and I won't forget that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; you ask. &quot;Just what do a couple of talking donkeys do around here?&quot;</p>
