<br />
Everyone turns their heads towards the direction of the explosion; most sensing something was wrong, yet could not see the black smoke rising as the trees were blocking the view to the town. Obscuring the police station from view. Being quick on her feet Samantha assures everyone that nothing is wrong as she head off the stage; Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya walking to the podium feeling perturbed that Samantha didn’t announce them.<br />
<br />
“Do you have any idea what the hell that explosion was,” Samantha whispering to Tachibana No Akane; ensuring no one could hear, despite everyone present being a were.<br />
“I already told Daisuke to check it out,” Tachibana whispering in return; “let’s hope it isn’t serious.”<br />
“It definitely wasn’t a car backfiring,” Samantha whispering; “I hope it isn’t some skullduggery from those criminals milling about.”<br />
“Well the fact that Sheriff Cooper and his deputies are not present at the picnic,” Tachibana looking perturbed; “implies it could very well be. Frederick Parker and his men have been a very noticeable thorn for us.”<br />
“More like a boil on one’s backside,” Samantha scowling; “the kind that refuses to be lanced.”<br />
“Ouch,” Tachibana laughing at comment; “that’s a good analogy. But in all seriousness,” Tachibana turning her attention back to the Crawford’s; “it looks like the show is about to begin, Lance’s reporter is already torpedoing the Mayoral announcement.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Sheriff,” Leon speaking through the walkie; “now would be a good time to return fire.”<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper heard the plea through the barrage of gunfire also coming through the walkie. Growling as he grabbed a bullhorn; Douglas nodded to his men, informing them to get into position as he made his way to the roof access ladder. Head outside as he watched Leon trying to launch another round of teargas despite being behind cover; he joins the were-lion and readies his bullhorn.<br />
<br />
“Frederick Parker,” Sheriff Cooper speaking through the bullhorn; “you and your men are to lay down your weapons and surrender. You are all under arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, assaulting a peace office with a deadly weapon and possible attempted murder of a peace officer.”<br />
“Best not let them know we know of their attempt to bust out Daniel Parker,” Douglas looking at Leon; “Dreams and an anonymous tip aside, we can’t charge them that until they gain entry into the jail itself.”<br />
“I don’t think they care,” Leon growling; “and I’m running low on tear gas.”<br />
“This is your last chance Frederick,” Sheriff Cooper speaking through the bullhorn; “surrender or we will use lethal force.”<br />
“Fuck You,” Fredrick swearing; “we are not leaving until my son is set free!”<br />
“That sounded like intent to commit a jail break to me,” Leon snorting.<br />
“Agreed,” Sheriff nodding; giving a shrill whistle, Sheriff Cooper signals his men to return fire.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Daisuke heard the gun fire well before he started to smell the acrid black smoke coming from Sheriff Cooper’s destroyed cruiser. Loosening the scabbard for his family’s katana; Daisuke doubles his efforts to head to the police station.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
The sudden explosion of gun fire coming from the police station forced Frederick’s men to retreat to the relative safety to their cars. Not expecting to face such fierce resistance; the men are fortunate that their body armor was able to take the hits, thus keeping them from getting killed.<br />
“You said you had a plan,” Frederick looking at the lead man and snarling at him; “you knew the layout, but what about manpower?”<br />
“Not now boss,” the man wincing. “Last time I get military hardware,” the man looking at the discarded RPG; “from a two-bit private thinking he is the next supplier to the warlords of the world.”<br />
“Nine men,” Frederick snapping; “and you couldn’t even get to the front entrance. You guys are fucking useless.”<br />
“At..least,” the man looking at the blood on his hand; his bullet proof vest letting a round through; “we... showed up.”<br />
“What does that mean,” Frederick seeing the man struggling to breath.<br />
“No…money,” the man expires before he could finish his sentence.<br />
<br />
Frederick looks at the man as he goes still; confused as to what was just said, Frederick was still unaware of Benton’s code: Omega. Code: Omega attacking the mobster’s finances; ensuring he couldn’t support his lifestyle, pay his men, bribe officials or hire top notch lawyers. Frederick was unaware of it all; nor was he paying attention to the sound of gunfire slowly fading as he grabbed the assault rifle at his feet and was about to resume his attack.<br />
<br />
Turning around and popping out from behind cover, Frederick swore as he saw deputies slowly approaching the remaining men that were putting their hands up into the air. Taking aim as he was still slightly obscured from the tear gas that was still irritating him; Frederick froze.<br />
“Lower your weapon,” Frederick could hear a man behind him speaking in a funny accent.<br />
Frederick was about to ignore the order, when he felt a sharp point press on his throat.<br />
“Lower your weapon,” the man speaking; “or lose your head.”<br />
<br />
Growling as he dropped his rifle, Frederick finally got a look at the man as he adjusts his position. Swearing as the man was in a black suit and tie, Frederick first assumed the man was a federal agent, yet the sword at his throat was not a typical weapon FBI issued to their agents.<br />
“Your no Fed,” Frederick spat; “who are you?”<br />
“I’m the man with a katana at your throat,” the well-dressed Japanese man answering; “but if you insist on knowing who brought you to heel, my name is Daisuke Tachibana, and this is a citizen’s arrest.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“So how the hell did you get hear so quick,” Sheriff Cooper looking at Daisuke.<br />
With the smoke finally cleared and paramedics on scene to tend to those that were wounded in the battle; fortunately for the sheriff and his deputies, nothing that a little iodine and a band aid won’t fix. Unfortunately for Frederick’s men; some had to be taken away in body bags.<br />
“We heard the explosion at the picnic grounds,” Daisuke answering; “I was sent to investigate. Plus the picnic and the station separated by some woods and a few streets…”<br />
“I get it,” Sheriff Cooper grunting; “at least we can finally put a wrap on Frederick and his shenanigans.”<br />
“IF you don’t mind,” Daisuke looking at the sheriff, “you mind telling me why you and your deputies were in a fire fight with the mobster?”<br />
“We got word he was planning to assault the jail,” Sheriff Copper beginning to explain as he led Daisuke to the station; “so we planned to repel the assault.”<br />
“While moving Daniel Parker to a more secure area of the station,” Daisuke responding.<br />
<br />
“Not quite,” Sheriff Cooper stopping so Frederick in hand cuffs and surrounded by deputies, making sure Frederick could hear the next bit; “we had Daniel transferred into the custody of federal agent Brooke Reed last night. He was sent to Seattle Field office well before midnight last night. And by now,” Douglas chuckling at the stunned mobster; “being given a simple choice. Testify against his father, or face the serious charges he committed here by nearly killing Peter Talbot.”<br />
“I hate to be the fly on the wall,” Daisuke shaking his head; “when you tell Leon that.”<br />
“You should have been yesterday then,” Sheriff Cooper grinning; “in fact you should have seen Leon with the grenade launcher on the roof. He kept Frederick and his men at bay with the tear gas while my deputies got into position to return fire.”<br />
<br />
Frederick seethed as he listened to the Sheriff and this Daisuke person walk away.<br />
‘How could the men I had keeping an eye on the roads miss Daniel being transported out of town,’ he wondered.<br />
Frederick’s thought was interrupted as he was unceremoniously made to get up and frogged marched inside the station.<br />
“Time to get processed like the common thug you are,” at deputy growling.<br />
“My lawyers make sure I never spend a day in this shithole,” Frederick snapping back.<br />
“Don’t bet on it,” the deputy responding; “you’re facing multiple counts of attempted murder of a peace officer. I doubt even the savviest lawyer will get you off on this.”</p>
