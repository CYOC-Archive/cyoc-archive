<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had expected some sort of magical weirdness, like the sensation of falling or a tunnel of light. But my hoof simply trod onto a surface of cold, <br />
sand and stretched out before me was a vast, rocky desert. The mist hung low and gave everything a tinted grey colour. There was light but no <br />
apparent sun. I looked behind me, expecting to see the red curtain I'd just stepped through, but there was only more desert. There was no <br />
going back now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot; I asked Runt as I set him down.<br />
&quot;Limbo,&quot; he explained.<br />
&quot;That's Purgatory, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's what it became. In the beginnin' it was just a nowhere place. Then wayward souls started settin' up camps here. Now it's where refugees <br />
go, waitin' to enter Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heaven?&quot; I repeated, &quot;Is that the next world up?&quot;<br />
Runt sniggered, &quot;Hardly. Limbo's slap bang in the middle of the ladder.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;I kinda figured Earth was in the middle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Earth people always do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was distracted by the sound of hurried footsteps. I turned around and saw a shape emerging from the fog. It was headed straight for us, and <br />
was holding a spear. My brain worked fast. My muscular fist collided with skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yowza!&quot; cried Runt, &quot;Good punch! He's out cold.&quot;<br />
I massaged my wrist as I took my first good look at what attacked us. It looked a lot like one of Jabba the Hutt's guards from Return of the <br />
Jedi, like a large, green pig man. It was like a horribly overweight, stumpy looking man, except with mottled green skin and a boar's head, with <br />
a large snout and dangerous looking tusks. It wore sandal like shoes, a fur loin-cloth and a chain-mail vest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your typical Limbo demon,&quot; Runt explained, &quot;They act as the guards of this realm. He's probably out huntin'. Lucky we ran into him, really.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;'Cause you're gonna need a new disguise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Him?&quot; I looked at the creature in disgust.<br />
&quot;We have to find another gate before the Angels figure out where we went. Our best bet of finding a gate is at one of the camps. Our best bet <br />
of getting into a camp is disguised as one of the guards. You can get us inside with me as your prisoner.&quot;<br />
&quot;I dunno...&quot; I said, &quot;It sounds risky.&quot;<br />
&quot;You got a better idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed.<br />
Runt knelt over the unconscious demon and began to undress him. He tossed the clothes, spear and various bits of jewelry toward me and had <br />
a good look at his new model. It wasn't pretty. Then, casting every other glance back at his reference, he began to mould me.<br />
<br />
First of all, he hung onto my shoulders and took my height down so I was only slightly taller than him. Then he took a fold of my belly and <br />
pulled it out into a large, flabby gut. I held it in my paws, sloshing it about as I got used to the extra weight. I'd gotten so used to being <br />
athletic and attractive this was kind of a sombre moment. <br />
<br />
Runt continued onto my legs. My hooves were almost right, but he made them smaller and my legs fatter. It made my posture so terrible I <br />
found it difficult to stay standing. He pulled my tail back and let go so that it whizzed back inside me like a rip-cord, becoming a short, curly <br />
thing. Similarly, he pushed my cock back into my body until it was only half the size. It was a little shorter than my human cock, which wasn't <br />
great. But, paying attention to the detail of the unconscious creature, he made it much broader. Short but fat, like the rest of me.<br />
<br />
Then he got to my head. Deciding to start from scratch, he simply pushed my snout and horns back into my face. For a moment, though I <br />
couldn't see it, my head was completely featureless apart from my mouth, eyes and ears. Then he took my top lip and pulled out a new snout. <br />
Large but stumpy, though somewhat familiar to the snout he'd given me that first night. Then he pulled out my teeth into two, impressive <br />
tusks. It made my mouth feel weird so I tried speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thish ish a new feeling,&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, I shound shtupid&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Runt told me, &quot;That's how they all sound.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then he quickly massaged my entire body, shaving off my white fur and replacing it with dark, green skin. It felt thicker than my normal skin <br />
though, which was strangely encouraging. While I'd felt much fitter as a minotaur, I felt certain that I could be stabbed with little effect in this <br />
body.<br />
<br />
Runt took a step back and compared me with my counterpoint. He spent a good twenty minutes retouching elements, adjusting proportions, <br />
adding precise freckles or stray hairs.<br />
&quot;Ahre you done yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nearly. I can never tell these guys apart. I need to make sure they recognise you,&quot; he said, &quot;There. Get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I pulled up the loincloth and fastened the belt before pulling on the chain-mail vest and shuffling into his sandals. <br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot; I asked.<br />
Runt passed me the spear. &quot;Pretty good, if I say so myself. And if Limbo demons could ever be considered good lookin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
A groan emerged from the snout of the real demon. He was coming round.<br />
&quot;Whath do we do wish him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kill him.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I balked, &quot;We can'th do that!&quot;<br />
&quot;We can't let him free. What do we do if two of yer turn up at the camp?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can'th you change him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt hesitated. &quot;Demons are harder to do... but he is quite a weak one.&quot;<br />
&quot;We can'th kill him. It'sh noth hish fault.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot; Runt sighed, &quot;Damn you... making me do nice things...&quot;<br />
<br />
He knelt over the creature and began to work. He took the thing's cock into his mouth and began to suck. The creature's weight and size began <br />
to drain away, until it was little more than three feet tall and its skeleton was visible. He pushed in his snout and pulled into a beak. Then he <br />
rolled it over and pulled out two, scrawny wings from its back.<br />
<br />
All the while, his face was screwed up in concentration. And with every movement he let out a tiny grunt. This was clearly very exhausting for <br />
him. He continued, rubbing out the creatures green skin and replacing it with a stony grey. Finally, he pulled out a long, thin tail. The demon <br />
was now a weak-looking gargoyle. And he was fully conscious. It opened its mouth to yell but no sound came out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; Runt told it, &quot;I wanted to kill you, so be thankful my friend is not so mean as I am. We need to borrow your body, okay? I got rid of your <br />
vocal cords, so you can't make trouble. But if you don't make things easy for us, you'll never get it back, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
The gargoyle stared at Runt. Then he nodded.<br />
&quot;Good. Now lead us to the camp.&quot;</p>
