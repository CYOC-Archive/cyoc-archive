<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry and Jess were happy to shut the door behind them. While the frantic morning spent in the kitchen was finally behind them, the repercussions still haunted them. Jess now had to duck as she entered her room, now standing over two feet taller than her partner, while Henry carried a heavy weight on his chest, with a pair of E-Cup breasts paired with two equally large teets. The couple were still panting, their racing hearts barely having time to settle from their morning outing, and the self proclaimed donkey show that followed. Jamie’s word still resonated with the new couple. About how their changes might be a manifestation of a deeper desire. The implications of their mutual species were slowly starting to dawn on them. If Jamie could get pregnant to a donkey, what was stopping the same thing from happening to Jess? The pair shared an uneasy look; a look that they both knew precluded a serious conversation that was well overdue. Jess wandered over towards their bed, gently laying herself down on its side as the mattress compressed beneath her weight. The bedframe creaked under the strain as a blush spread across Jess’ cheeks. She turned away from Henry, Embarrassed. “God, I’m covered in milk. What am I doing sitting on our sheets?!” She exclaimed, standing up again suddenly. The springs in the mattress creaked as they recoiled, but the sound was quickly drowned out by a loud ‘THUD’.<br />
<br />
“Ow!” Jess cried out, standing up too fast as she knocked her head on on the beams by their bed. <br />
<br />
“Jess-” Henry called out, running to her side, but she held her arm out to keep him at bay.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine. Just a little knock. I’ll get over it.” She said, cradling her head in her arms.<br />
<br />
“Well.. Be careful. We still need that big brain of yours in one piece if we’re ever going to make it out of here.” He mused. Jess let out an innocent laugh, pondering the progress she’d made on deciphering the book. She was getting close to something. Before she put herself to bed last night, she managed to make out what seemed to be directions. She just needed to find the starting point. Jess sighed. A silence hung in the air between the two of them, both knowing what they needed to talk about, and the book wasn’t it.<br />
<br />
“I Should go shower… Clean up a little. Then maybe you might want to as well? You’re just as covered as I am you know. She said, immediately making an excuse to leave the room.<br />
<br />
“Jess. Wait.” Henry said as Jess stopped in her tracks. “Maybe this is a conversation best had while we’re… Um… Spent…” Henry finally spluttered. “I don’t want to get too much energy back.”<br />
<br />
Jess sighed again, nodding reluctantly as she looked back towards Henry, her eyebrow arched as she motioned for him to continue.<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Henry gave her a reassuring smile, before his face became more serious.<br />
<br />
So… Jamie.” Henry’s reluctant tone set the mood for their conversation. His mouth hung open in silence, poised to continue before Jess beat him to the punch.<br />
<br />
“She’s… She’s so far gone… I don’t even think you could convince her that changing was a bad thing anymore. Not after that revelation.” Jess’ hands subconsciously traveled to her stomach, cupping her bulging fat as she mumbled “I can&#39;t believe that she&#39;s… pregnant!” <br />
<br />
Henry grunted in response. Jess went straight for the thing that was weighing the most heavily on his mind. “Jess… Honey. I know Jamie might have made everything out there sound grand and exciting... But we really cannot afford for that to happen to us. You know that right?” Henry spoke softly, hoping the soft tone of his voice would at least provide some comfort to their sharp conversation.<br />
<br />
Jess’ fingers lingered on her stomach before slipping away and falling to her waist side.<br />
<br />
“I… I know that...” It took nary a moment for the guilt to begin to well inside her words laced with mistruth. In her mind she was trying to stifle her growing Jealousy of Jamie. She didn’t see it fair that her sibling could just do whatever she wanted. She loved Henry, she should have that right to choose those things. But at the same time, she understood that the Cabin’s magic was more likely at play here than her own natural emotions. Finally she spoke again, gifting Henry the response he longed to hear.<br />
<br />
“If we ever get out of here. We can’t have that complication. I understand.” Jess looked up at Henry, taking in the relieved expression that adorned his face.<br />
<br />
“I do have to wonder how what Jamie said was true. About wanting something enough that the Cabin grants it for you…” Jess spoke quickly, not wanting to let the previous topic linger. Her eyes darted back to the ground, hoping that her guilt wasn’t too obviously plastered across her face. “Before I grew.. I had this overwhelming feeling of helplessness. Of being stuck, unable to take control. And then, well.” Jess motioned towards her body with both hands. Henry nodded, getting the picture. “I don’t know what else I ‘want’. I have no idea what my next change could be. Maybe it was just a one off.” Jess finally concluded.<br />
<br />
Henry sat in deeper thought, looking down at the pair of large breasts that now adorned his chest. Ever since they’d grown he knew that he would have to deal with them overtly. It wasn’t something that he could just tuck away and hide. What’s more was that if what Jamie said was true, did that mean that this change was something that he actively wanted? He had to cast his mind back to that moment, wondering if there was anything that he was thinking or might have done that would give the impression that he wanted breasts. The best that he could come up with would have been his own desire for Jess’ at the time. After all, he was practically face first into them.<br />
<br />
Jess noticed Henry staring at his new additions, looking over them with a frown on his face. She tried to lighten the mood. “I uh, hope you’re ready for the back-pain.” She joked half heartedly, extracting a smile from Henry. “Did… Did you want to talk about those? I know it’s a massive difference compared to what you had before…” She tested Henry’s reaction, hoping to offer some comfort while trying not to push things too far, but despite her best intentions her own insecurities just came bubbling out. “We’ve been pretty lucky so far.. Mom and Jamie… They have... ‘both’, now… But not us. I suppose it won’t be long…” Jess pondered, solemnly. Her eyes gazing down towards Henry’s limp cock, picturing a vagina nestled behind his balls. She finally looked down at her own body. Her sex was hidden behind her plump figure, but she had to wonder what it would be like once she had a cock.<br />
<br />
Henry lifted his hands beneath his new Breasts, cupping them gently as he let them rise and fall. He was shocked at how heavy they felt against his chest, though given their size he supposed that shouldn’t have been much of a surprise. “They… Are what they are.” He answered stoically, not wanting to let them bother him he turned his attention towards Jess.<br />
<br />
“We’ve been here long enough. We know we take that chance every time we slip up… I know I run this risk of repeating myself, but please don’t let your changes worry you. You’ll be my beautiful cow, no matter what either one of us has between our legs.” Henry forced a smile, getting one in return from Jess as she looked at him lovingly. “And you’ll be my handsome bull.” She shot him a kiss through the air. “The only difference now is that we have one more pitfall to watch out for… We’ll just have to try our best to not have that happen.”<br />
<br />
Jess tried her best to stifle a blush. Not wanting to let on to Henry just how much the idea resonated with her. At first when Jamie was talking about it, she felt disgusted. After all, he was still partly human. But something about the idea, when she considered her and Henry; It made her feel all warm inside. In the end she nodded in agreement with Henry, not wanting to worry him. But despite her convictions, the idea lingered.<br />
<br />
“We… We don’t have much control over it… But god forbid. What will we do if that does happen?” Jess asked, wondering about the logistics of it all. “We don’t even know what will happen if we get out of here. If our changes will revert. If we’re stuck like this… forever. If I’m pregnant and we leave; will that disappear too?” She asked, though not expecting any answer from Henry.<br />
<br />
“Jess, I wouldn’t even begin to know what those answers might be…”<br />
<br />
Jess buried her head in her hands, massaging her temples as she pushed those thoughts to the back of her mind.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I know… We shouldn’t worry. Not much like there’s much to do…” Jess sighed as Henry looked on solemnly. A silence hung in the air for a moment, long enough for the two cows to hear the front door of the cabin clatter shut. Jamie&#39;s muffled voice could be heard, alongside the clopping of hooves. The noise disappeared as it drifted further towards the woods, before falling silent. Henry and Jess shared a nervous exchange before Jess wanted no more of it.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s time for a shower!” Jess said, standing suddenly as she changed the topic. ‘BANG’ Her head clanged against the lights once more as she keeled over, holding her head in pain as she groaned aloud. “Ngh, that’s going to take some getting used to.” Henry grimaced, holding his own head in solidarity as Jess left the room, heading into the row of showers that were adjacent to their barnyard home. <br />
<br />
Jess took her time in the shower, gathering her thoughts as she washed her mammoth new body. She had never found the showers to be particularly roomy, but at the very least they were accommodating enough to clean herself and be on her way. Of course, things were different now. Things that she’d never thought about were becoming issues. The shower head, for example, was locked in a fixed position such that the water only managed to reach the middle of her back. She now had to crouch awkwardly if she was to even attempt to wet her hair. Even the actual dimensions of the showers were causing problems. With her latest growth, she was beginning to feel a little claustrophobic. Something was always bumping into one of the walls, whether it be her udder or her rear or even just her hips. The sides of the shower shook and rattled with her every movement, followed by a curse beneath the young woman&#39;s breath. Jess’ struggle was not lost on Henry as he sent a worried gaze towards the stalls. Finally the sound of running water came to a stop and Jess stepped out, steam pouring off her body. She reached out towards a towel, beginning the arduous process of drying herself.<br />
<br />
“My clothes are still in the living room… Not that they would fit anyways” Jess tilted her head back in frustration, just wanted to get this whole day over with.  She looked down at herself, pondering her height and weight. Wondering if there was anyone that had stayed in the cabin that was even her size. She couldn‘t even wrap her towel around her body as she strolled back out into the Barn, making eye contact with Henry who had laid down on their bed. “Forgot some clothes.” Jess said briefly, tip toeing through the barn towards a dresser on the opposite side. She dropped the towel altogether before opening the top drawer, grabbing some undergarments before she held them against herself, tossing away the ones that were clearly too small. She continued the process until the drawer was empty, and a pile of panties lay stacked up beside her. She let out a frustrated sigh before collecting herself. “Okay… No underwear then…”<br />
<br />
Jess went into the drawer of shirts, rummaging through the clothing until she found the largest item. It was a 4XL Shirt, plain and unnoteworthy besides it’s ridiculous size. “Surely this will fit…” Jess nodded to her own words, hoping to convince herself. She lifted the shirt above her head, feeding her arms through the holes as she inhaled, trying her best to suck in her not insignificant girth. The collar slotted over her head as she lowered her arms, grabbing the shirt by the waist as she pulled it down, straining herself as the fabric stretches across her rolls. “Ngh… C’mon…” She stubbornly fights, pulling the waist over her breasts. “Gah!” She grunted as she put all her force into tugging, pulling the fabric down and over, finally squeezing her mammaries into the cotton. With one final pull the shirt clears her stomach as Jess stands triumphant. “There!” She exclaims, holding her hands up high, posing victoriously. Her tail swished happily behind her for a brief second before a tearing sound echoed through the barn. Henry turned a nervous eye towards Jess as she finally breathed out, “RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP” The shirt splits at the seams, her udder and breasts bursting out in a perverse display as the fabric of the former shirt clung limply to her slumped shoulders.<br />
<br />
Jess stamped her foot in frustration, her body jiggling as she tore through her fathers drawers now. Articles of clothing flew from her grasp, each one smaller than the shirt that had met its demise by her hand; or more accurately, udders. She tried on countless articles of clothing, grey sweatpants that couldn’t clear her thighs, larger women&#39;s dresses that clumped up around her breasts. Nothing she tried would cover her new form. Jess stood there, stark naked in a pile of stretched and torn clothing, wondering what she was going to do.<br />
<br />
“Nothing fits…. I have no clothes…” She mumbled, finally slowing down enough for Henry to approach. He hovered behind her, restricting his touch for fear of what might happen.<br />
<br />
“Jess…” He sighed, looking for the right words to say. “We… We knew this was going to happen eventually… It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Maybe I… I can join you? If you wanted.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not embarrassed! Not after what we all just did… I’m worried! I can’t walk around naked! I might set one of the others off! I might set you off!” Jess ranted, growing weary towards the end as she leaned into Henry. She just wanted him to hold her, to tell her everything was going to be okay. But their new size difference made that difficult with Henry standing several feet shorter.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to worry about me… I’ll be fine. I’ll just have to… Find other ways to deal with things.” Henry concluded.<br />
<br />
Jess nodded along, only partially listening to what he had to say. She could just imagine the leering eyes of Melissa and her mother. Judging her. Lusting after her. Somehow she didn’t think it would bother Jamie. Jess finally snapped out of it, casting her own eyes down her body as she swallowed loudly, the gulp getting stuck in her throat. This was her body now. In all its naked glory. Somehow deep down, she knew that it wouldn’t be as easy as Henry made it sound. Life was about to get much harder.</p>
