<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob&#39;s heart was racing. (S)he almost couldn&#39;t believe this was real. It was the ultimate character creation tool--in the palm of her hands. She finished up in the bathroom, following her instinct to wipe up her &quot;new&quot; slit before pulling back on her boxers and pants. As much as Jacob felt like taking things for a test drive, her memories betrayed the boredom over playing with her hand and various toys she now knew were under her bed in a box.<br />
<br />
On a whim; after washing her hands, Jacob decided to check social media to see if there were any changes. Surprisingly, her Instagram had a few extra followers. She scrubbed through the timeline to make sure there weren&#39;t any other weird pictures, and pretty much everything was normal. Except every picture where Jacob had his legs spread subconsciously, now had her crossing her legs.<br />
<br />
Jacob got an idea, but he didn&#39;t quite want to go all-in with the full body changes. At least not yet. He wondered what else the reality toggles could do, and to what extent the effects would be implemented. ||After all, a good QA tester is thorough!||<br />
<br />
She grabbed a towel and strutted back to the Chronivac. It felt a bit weird walking without his male bits, in spite of the memories of a lifetime of being this way. With every step, it felt like she wanted to overcompensate how close she wanted her legs to stay to her center of balance. After all; there was a void where there was once a wedge.<br />
<br />
Jacob took out her camera again, took off her jeans, and made a butt-centric pose in her boxers. With a bit of a gulp, she pushed &quot;Post!&quot; to instagram. Thankfully none of her family were tech-savvy enough to have anything to do with most social media that wasn&#39;t Facebook.<br />
<br />
A few comments rolled in from Jacob&#39;s friends, it was mostly positive stuff like &quot;You go gurl!!1!&quot; and &quot;Werk it!&quot; with a winky emoji. But there were also a few trolls, from the anonymous few additions she&#39;d gained with the reality alterations. &quot;Flat f****t&quot; and &quot;Man ass&quot; were two that showed up, before someone else--too quick for Jacob to even form much of an opinion on the statement--reported the first and it was struck from the comments. She chuckled to herself; if only they knew how close they were to the truth in this new reality. No matter, time to prove some jerks wrong.<br />
<br />
Jacob sat back down at the Chronivac. There were a few different ways she could do this, but out loud she declared, &quot;Why not both?&quot; so she got to work. She would first do a test run to see how much things were affected by the reality alteration. She also noticed the timer option earlier, and was curious what that was like. Deciding she liked how the presets worked for the gender transition, she started applying the reality-specific parameters to her butt stats. Once that was out of the way, she wanted to see the extreme to which she could push the 3D model. She toggled the butt to &quot;female&quot; as her previous changes hadn&#39;t affected anywhere non-genitally related. She then moved the master slider all the way to the right to the &quot;MAX&quot; and checked out the 3D model. It was absolutely ridonkulous. Each ass-cheek more resembled a beanbag chair than an ass-cheek, though they oddly still remained firm. If Jacob applied these changes, her computer chair would surely break; regardless of any reality-matching settings.<br />
<br />
As much as Jacob wanted to max out first and blow her transformation &quot;load&quot;; she was still curious about the extent. Leaving the slider at about halfway to &quot;Max&quot; she implemented a time constraint. <br />
&quot;Will grow [10]% every [10] minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
Going over the changes once more, she clicked &quot;Apply&quot; once she was satisfied. She briefly toyed with the idea of applying the first change quicker, but realized she could settle into something where she wouldn&#39;t notice until things had cranked up a little. She decided to go back to her main PC and load up a game of League, one of the game modes that only took about 20-30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Jacob ended up with a decent comp, but they struggled for roughly 33 minutes before the enemy managed to push them back. The last few teamfights especially, Jacob had felt a bit uncomfortable in her chair and kept squirming around. It kept feeling like it was too narrow...<br />
<br />
As Jacob ended the game, his mind wandered and he remembered the changes. She looked down and sure enough; where there had been a man-ass before, was now unmistakably ballooned and was impeding on the sides of her computer chair. Her new memories accounted for this; she&#39;d been lucky that her butt had formed shapely since a little after graduation, though she&#39;d been a bit of a late bloomer throughout high school. She&#39;d really begun to fill out downstairs, in spite of her rather mannish upper body.<br />
<br />
Jacob quickly reached for her phone, and checked her instagram post. Surely enough, she now had an additional 500 followers, and the picture that she had posted a little while ago had over 1000 hearts. There were no negative comments. Plenty of sleazy ones, but that comes with the territory. More importantly, the boxer picture had a very clear curvy shape outlined where it didn&#39;t before. Her chair began to feel tighter, and the image refreshed. It was now pushing out enough that a tiny hint of ass-crack was now visible above the elastic in the image. Another 800 likes, 2000 followers. Looking at the history, many of the followers were from &quot;before&quot; today; so this wasn&#39;t attributed to the most recent picture.<br />
<br />
Diving back through her history, sure enough every image the last several years had an absolute dump truck of an ass, always in jeans (Jacob&#39;s clothing of choice, of course). And it was only going to get rounder. She walked to the bathroom to examine her new growth. Each step caused a jiggle to ripple across each cheek. She found herself offsetting her posture naturally, which gave a new sexy sway to the strut from earlier.<br />
<br />
Jacob took off her boxers after she walked through the threshold of the bathroom. Sure enough, she had an ass that would make more than a few Brazilians jealous. She pivoted it in front of the mirror, and gave her left cheek a firm *SMACK* which--surprisingly--felt amazing. She watched the force ripple across her left butt-cheek, and watched the glowing hand-print appear which made her feel more than a little warm. Mid-wobble, it almost seemed to get bigger, but it was hard to tell. 10% was subtle enough when combined with the impaired awareness of the reality changes, it was nearly impossible without it being noticeable.<br />
<br />
She checked back on social media, and sure enough the picture that had before displayed a hint of a crak, displayed a full few inches as the boxers were clearly straining against the pressure. Ignoring the damp feeling between her legs, she decided to put back on the boxers; struggling to pull the waist past her cheeks. The elastic gave a few *POP* noises, but all in all she was eventually able to work them on. Though now, with all the increased junk in the trunk, they were beginning to more resemble daisy dukes than boxers. She felt the grip of the fabric hugging her pussy, giving a clear camel toe through the boxers. They would probably survive the rest of the changes, but it might get a little...tight.<br />
<br />
She jiggled her way back to the computer with the Chronivac on it, and noticed that both chairs had been replaced.  They were now double-wide, with plenty of room for her ass. As she sat back down, she noticed the additional height being provided by her endowment. It was like sitting on two stacks of pillows! But it was just a bit too high. So she pulled her cheeks apart a little--lowering her height to match the monitors. </p>
