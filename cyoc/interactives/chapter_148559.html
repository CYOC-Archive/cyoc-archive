<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin realized, what he had done to Robin, or rather now Robyn, may have very well have obliterated who Robyn used to be, having changed his species, gender, attitude, beliefs, using him almost as raw material to make Colin&#39;s new servant... true, Colin hadn&#39;t changed Robin&#39;s tastes, or preferences (as far as he knew)... But Colin decided, if he was going to do something like this... he might as well EMBRACE IT... and ACCEPT what he had done, instead of hiding behind justifications and excuses! Sure, he could argue maybe he&#39;d given Robin a better road... a road as a die-hard servant... but Colin realized how selfish and vicious what he&#39;d done was... And decided indeed, he didn&#39;t care. The whole world was his sand box... He could make himself bullet proof, invincible, invulnerable to everything... But... that almost felt boring! If he was going to have this kinda power, having NO limits or challenges would be get boring very fast. So Colin, foolish or not, chose to let himself remain vulnerable, if only to keep the thrill of being alive intact. <br />
<br />
If he was going to use this power to turn the world, or at least his home town, into his personal furry fantasy, he might as well drop any pretense that he was doing anything else. He had Plato&#39;s invisible ring so to speak, and he was going to use it! Did this make him the bad guy? Not if he asks if he was the good guy! Ha! <br />
<br />
Also, with this crazy power, any chances Colin had for a normal life were shot to hell anyway, unless he wanted to watch what he said for the rest of his life, or took a vow of silence, or moved to a desert island, or lived with only a group of deaf people, soon or later he was going to blurt out in fear or concern &#39;Is she dead?!&#39; and the automatic &#39;yes&#39; would come and that person would have died. Or asking &#39;was that an attack?&#39; and the yes would come, and suddenly the country would be at war! Yeah... Colin could kiss any chances for a normal life out the window... Best he make the most twisted and insane most of this as he possibly could! <br />
<br />
Western dragons were greedy, materialistic, selfish, egotistical, and brutal (basically the opposite of their eastern cousins), he might as well embrace what was now his true nature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Robyn, are your parents in the living room patiently waiting for us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; came the automatic answer, like fate was speaking through Robyn rather than Robyn responding herself, &quot;Master.&quot; She added in her own voice. <br />
<br />
In a blur, Mr. and Mrs. Rodgers appeared on their living room, looking tired, and mostly asleep, but not impatiently so. <br />
<br />
&quot;So kid, what&#39;s the &#39;meeting&#39; about? You know my daughter is always eager to help you with whatever, you don&#39;t need my permission,&quot; Robyn&#39;s father said, not even looking at his Kobold daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you two Kobolds too?&quot; Colin asked, remember that including a negative canceled out the effect. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; they echoed dimly. <br />
<br />
&#39;Might as well make them a matching set!&#39; Colin thought with a wicked glimmer. <br />
<br />
And the world blurred as they transformed. <br />
<br />
The two shrank down, their clothing vanishing with them, rusty brown scales covered the body of Robyn&#39;s father while Robyn&#39;s mother&#39;s scales became the same green as her daughter&#39;s. Their fingers and toes becoming claws, and a tiny tail emerged from their backsides, and their faces pushed coward into tiny muzzles with dainty fangs. Like himself, Colin say that the manhood of Robyn&#39;s father was protectively hidden away. They were only a few inches taller than their daughter. Like her daughter, Robyn&#39;s mother was also a short-stack beauty. <br />
<br />
The entire house changed, the door was still big (for their Master to have no trouble entering of course), as was the ceiling (poor taste to have to have Master duck while inside), while most of the furniture changed size to fit the Kobold except a lavish plush chair in the center of the room. The house became spotless and perfectly organized (Master could visit at any time after all). <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish to stay for breakfast Master? We shall provide however you wish!&quot; Mrs. Rodgers said, her husband deferring to him as was the Kobold way, just as all Kobold deferred to dragons. She looked eager and exited at the chance to serve her draconic better. She wasn&#39;t human, not in the least. <br />
<br />
There was also a draconic shrine of worship right in the living room now. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, not today, but thank you. I&#39;ll be taking Robyn with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master,&quot; the two kobolds bowed obediently. <br />
<br />
Robyn followed without having to be told of course. Colin saw the outside was also perfectly maintained to showroom quality. Colin wondered idly how this affected their jobs and hobbies, but he could wonder about that later. <br />
<br />
&quot;Robyn, hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-M-master!&quot; Robyn blushed an insane amount. &quot;I couldn&#39;t! I shouldn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I order you to hold onto to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As my Master commands it,&quot; Robyn said and grasped onto Coin&#39;s bodybuilder leg, unable to hide the bliss of feeling his body. <br />
<br />
With that, Colin took off, he didn&#39;t think about he&#39;d never flown technically until that morning, but he was now flying, even with a passenger, without the greatest of ease, like he&#39;d been doing it his own life. Well, if the power was anything to go so far, he likely had. <br />
<br />
Colin came in, &quot;Hey Jane, I&#39;m back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, oh, you brought Robyn with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Master&#39;s sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze, I wish I could get Robyn&#39;s family to do what I wanted just cause of some million year old blood pact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin thought about it. And asked, &quot;Are you a dragon Jane? Do you respect me as an equal?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jane mindlessly said, &quot;Yes. Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane&#39;s clothes began to fade away, but even as they did, stunning beautiful sapphire scales covered her body. She grew in size and body build much like Colin had, though not the He-Man level his previous question had given him. She came a dragon very similar to him. An alligator snout, fan like ears, bat wings, a long reptilian tail, a forked tongue, slited eyes but her were bright ruby color rather than emerald, and her hands and feet gained claws. But then, her wrists, ankles, waist, neck, horns, and ears, were all stunned with jewelry. Gems of various sorts and gold circled around her body, none of it covered anything that a human would consider part of modesty, instead, it was a display of wealth and vanity. Somehow, Jane managed to make the king&#39;s ransom in finer actually WORK for her, complimenting her natural colors rather than distracting from them. Colin didn&#39;t feel anything different for his own sister, but he couldn&#39;t deny she was now definitely beautiful by dragon standards. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, I wish there were more of you little guys around to share,&quot; Jane said in endearing tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you mistress!&quot; Robyn bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, maybe some will, I mean, I&#39;m sure some will turn up,&quot; Colin said catching himself. This was going to be trouble with him eventually accidentally setting it off, it was only a matter of time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jane, wanna eat out today?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jane said simply.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ugh! Oh right! Yes/no, questions, always yes. I really did want to know whether she wanted to eat out! Well, she does now.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think mom and dad will be fine with us going out by ourselves?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jane said simply. <br />
<br />
The pair of dragons went outside, and Robyn again held onto Colin as they took off for a favorite diner of theirs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, be careful, you&#39;re going to make some girls jealous like that,&quot; Jane teased. Respect as an equal or not, she was still his big sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I simply hold as Master orders me to!&quot; Robyn said quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you do,&quot; Jane smiled. She&#39;d taken her walkman with her, now designed to fit her draconic head.<br />
<br />
The two headed inside the diner, already opening, and with a few customers already inside. <br />
<br />
Colin looked at them, all these people, oblivious to how two dragons and a kobold, all naked, all creatures that should have existed only in myths, stood before them. And anything Colin asked of them, would be true. Reality was his to do with as he pleased. Whatever they had been or would have been no longer mattered, they were raw material for Colin to remake as he pleased. Whatever reality had been before, no longer was, whatever future was going to be, never would have been. <br />
<br />
The two dragons sat down. Robyn stood at attention before Jane patted the seat next to her. &quot;Come on Robyn, sit with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then, what if-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have waitresses and stuff for that here, sit down with us and relax, if I have make that an older Kobold I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mistress,&quot; Robyn said obediently and sat down next to the much larger dragon. <br />
<br />
A waitress came over. &quot;Can I take your order? Oh, would you like a booster seat?&quot; She asked Robyn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she would,&quot; Jane answered for her. Robyn didn&#39;t object. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we have this breakfast for free?&quot; Colin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are our lucky random customers today, breakfast is on us!&quot; She said with a smile and nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s lucky,&quot; Jane said. <br />
<br />
Colin didn&#39;t even hesitate, why should he? Everything he could do, was his to do. All he needed was another person to ask. He wondered if there were any other limits on his power besides that. If there were, he&#39;d find them soon enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, are you Kobold?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the waitress said. And just like that, her body shrank, becoming big boobed, little body, with wide hips, her body covered in copper colored scales, her face a cross between a reptile and a dog, and just as loyal. Her clothing vanished except for the apron she was wearing and her name tag, well, they weren&#39;t clothing, they were a uniform after all. Her tail wagged behind her. &quot;Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
She&#39;d also brought a booster seat with her now without asking. It seemed Jane being nice to the servants was as routine happenstance now. With she helped Robyn with without missing a beat. <br />
<br />
Robyn ordered simply sunnyside up eggs, the dragons on the other hand, ordered a huge breakfast for themselves. With an insane level of efficiency, the breakfast was brought out in a much faster time than usual. <br />
<br />
In that time however, Colin had gotten out his phone and texted an online buddy of his: &#39;C&PT&N&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you a dragon?&#39; He typed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Naw. I always preferred wolves.&#39; Was the reply.<br />
<br />
&#39;So texting, doesn&#39;t work.&#39; Colin thought. <br />
<br />
He then called a friend of his, Rex. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Rex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Good morning! I thought dragons were heavy sleepers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex, are you a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, very funny, only not really, no, last time I checked I wasn&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, bad joke, will make it up later I promise, oh! Sorry! Meant to chat longer, but foods here! Sorry!&quot; He tried to think of how to affect Rex without it being a negative, but then remembered it wouldn&#39;t work anyway. He hung up as the food arrived, the Kobold proving surprising angle with the food trays she deposited without trouble. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope all is to your satisfaction Master, Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be Lea!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mistress!&quot; Lea bowed and left to attend to other costumers. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are nice to them,&quot; Colin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, they&#39;ve sworn themselves to us for eternity, why NOT be nice? They&#39;re not objects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin got a twisted idea from that and looked around, until he spotted a man alone at the bar. Was he was a father? A criminal? A police officer? Didn&#39;t matter. That existence was coming to an end. <br />
<br />
Colin got up, and walked towards the unwitting victim and tapped him on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The man said automatically.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oy! That was meant to be rhetorical. Ugh. This is going to get annoying.&#39;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Does no one mind seeing an animated love doll naked in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. That&#39;s a weird question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does no one mind seeing an animated love doll be used in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. But you know that&#39;s not really a question you outta ask someone out of nowhere dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you my sister&#39;s personal animated love doll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; He said. In a flash he changed. Everything he wore vanished, how can something that is owned, own anything? And what use did a love doll have for clothing? His body turned a bright neon blue, all body hair vanished into nothing, his body&#39;s front side from the underside of his jaw downwards became bright white. His fingers and toes dissolved as they formed into the shape of claws. A mold line formed along the outline of his body, and his body became that of a super model. But then a tail emerged from his rear, along with wings on his back, and his head became reptilian with horns. He became to squeak as his moved, his body hollowing out. Two grip handles, like those of a pool toy, grew from his hips. An air valve replaced his belly button. His eyes became to look painted on even as he continued to look around and blink. A barcode and copyright information appeared on his right buttocks. Unlike Colin, his manhood was out and on full display, permanently upright, and longer than any flesh and blood being&#39;s had a right to be. He stood up at attention, and in a blur, he was now sitting next to Jane. The love doll obediently waiting for its owner to need something from it involving giving her any pleasure she pleased. There was no food in front of it of course, what use did it have for food? <br />
<br />
Jane continued to eat her breakfast without looking his way. Colin looked through his phone, and found a &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; message from Jane&#39;s last birthday, a gift from one of her friends, showing the new draconic love doll standing at attention besides her. <br />
<br />
Colin admitted, he had only tried to turn Rex into a girl as an experiment since asking if he was a dragon would be WAY MORE awkward than the girl one, even both were kinda crazy. But Colin had no real interest into turn Rex into a girl. But that didn&#39;t meant Colin wasn&#39;t interested in upgrading his friends into superior creatures. Maybe make them something other than dragons to keep things fresh? Maybe. What could possibly be better than being made fellow dragons after all? Depends how he felt when they showed up. <br />
<br />
Oh right, he couldn&#39;t use his power over the phone. He&#39;d affected his parents by asking Jane before... would that work here now? Or was that just because his parents were close by, or it was a question that Jane would obviously know the answer to? That was a possibility Colin hadn&#39;t considered. If not, he could just invite them for a quick get together. His friends all knew he was finally back from their family trip, so wouldn&#39;t they all get together? <br />
<br />
But first, he walked to the cashier dude and asked, &quot;Are you a Kobold?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; And instantly, only his name tag and apron remained, shrinking down, and quickly covered in brownish red scales, standing on a step stool to be on eye level with those who came in. The reptile blinked his dull yellow eyes sideways. <br />
<br />
He then shouted right into the visible kitchen, normally something that was insanely rude, taboo, disrespectful, and a hundred other things, but none of that mattered to Colin. &quot;Are you a Kobold?!&quot; <br />
<br />
The cook turned to him and immediately his anger faded as he said simply. &quot;Yes.&quot; His apron and chef hat remained, but that was all, and indeed looked a little comical on the brownish-red Kobold, the equipment within actually changing height and shape to accommodate the cook&#39;s stature and nature. His little naked tail neatly tucked behind him. Holding the frying pan with perfect skill. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing great,&quot; Colin said realizing the Kobold&#39;s eyes were glued on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master!&quot; The cook said before going back to cooking at an incredible speed, the only thing slowing him down was cooking time. <br />
<br />
He had to get around to upgrading his parents into dragons next chance he got as well. But that was for later. <br />
<br />
He finally went back to the table, leaving the rest of the customers alone (for now). &quot;Jane, can my friends make it here in a couple minutes?&quot; He asked, wanting to see if his power could affect those whom Jane couldn&#39;t logically know the answer to.</p>
