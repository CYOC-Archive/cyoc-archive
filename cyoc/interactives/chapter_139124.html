<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Surprisingly things seemed to have improved slightly since gym. While Lynne and Sasha weren’t exactly best friends they were at least on polite terms. Gloria had watched as the two talked with one another after gym. Although she couldn’t hear what they were saying it appeared they were beginning to come to an understanding. As Gloria and the others now entered Ms. Deans class Gloria pulled Sasha aside.<br />
<br />
“So what did you talk about,” Gloria asked. Sasha shrugged as they headed towards their desks. “It was just small talk,” she said. “I mean I did apologize for punching her in the face and not leaving her alone when she asked. She said thanks, then we just talked. We...kind of have a lot in common.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously,” Jackie said in astonishment as she sat down next to Gloria and Sasha. “You two? I’m finding that hard to believe.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t of believed it either,” Sasha answered. “But it turns out we do. Believe it or not we both like the same kind of movies, we even like the same classes. It was weird, I always thought Lynne was just some stuck up pretty chick.”<br />
<br />
“Appearances can be deceiving,” Diane stated. “In case anyone remembers we were all scared of Sasha the first time we met.”<br />
<br />
The girls giggled as they began to talk. After a few moments though they paused, Ms. Dean still hadn’t come to class. “Where’s Ms. Dean,” Felicia asked. Reiki shrugged as she looked at the anxious class of freshmen looking for their teacher. “Huh good question,” she said. “Maybe we have a sub.”<br />
<br />
As the girls continued to talk they saw the door slowly open. Turning they noticed a very attractive blond woman in her late twenties enter the class. “Sorry I’m late,” she said. “I was just talking with the principal about Ms. Dean. Unfortunately she went home I’ll so I’ll be taking over the day. My name is Ms. O’Toole.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends looked at the smiling woman as she made her way towards Ms. Dean’s desk. For some reason the woman looked familiar. “Gloria is she a relative of yours,” Felicia asked. Gloria shrugged as she continued to look at the woman. “No idea but she looks familiar. Maybe Lynne can tell us.”<br />
<br />
Turning Gloria could see her sister and Trica gawking at the woman in complete shock. Seeing this Gloria now became slightly alarmed and now attempted to get her sisters attention. “Hey Lynne,”she whispered. “LYNNE.”<br />
<br />
Lynne turned towards her sister, her jaw still hanging open. “What,” she hissed.<br />
<br />
“Who is that?”<br />
<br />
Lynne furrowed her brow as she gazed at her sister Gloria. “Seriously,” she hissed in exasperation. “You don’t know?” Gloria shook her head, she was having trouble placing the woman’s face. Lynne sighed in frustration before angrily staring at the woman. “Ugh I’ll handle this okay,” she moaned. “Just don’t hold this against me later on.” Gloria could only watch in confusion as Lynne stood from her desk, Tricia desperately trying to pull her friend back into her seat.<br />
<br />
“O’toole Huh,” Lynne exclaimed. “Seriously, you decided to use the name O’Toole.”<br />
<br />
Ms. O’Toole looked at the young teen a stern look carved into her beautiful face. “Is their a problem Ms. Turner?”<br />
<br />
“Oh cut the crap Gloria I know it’s you.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends gawked at the woman as she sighed. “Fine,” she answered. Raising her hand they watched as the woman snapped her fingers. As Gloria and the others looked around they could that aside from Lynne, Tricia, and themselves everyone else in the class was frozen in time. “So how did you figure it out,” the adult Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
“Wait that’s me,” Gloria exclaimed. Lynne sighed as she looked at her teenage sister. “Yeah that’s you in about 15 years,” She sighed. Turning she now glowered at her older sister who was sitting at the teachers desk. “And you get on my ass about being reckless with spells,” she grumbled. “The hell Gloria, you travel back and item, come into this school, AND use a glamor charm to conceal your identity.”<br />
<br />
“That reminds me how did you see through my charm,” AdultGloria mused as she smirked at her kid sister. <br />
<br />
“Hello I’m your sister,” Lynne exclaimed throwing her hands in the air. “And you taught me that damn spell so spill it, what are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Hold up,” Jackie exclaimed. “Are you telling me that THATS Gloria in the future. Why does she look like a model and why is she here?”<br />
<br />
“Especially after all that talk about screwing up the timeline,”Felicia added. “All I’ve heard for the last month is how dangerous it was for Lynne to travel back in time.”<br />
<br />
The adult Gloria could only smile and nod as she looked at the young versions of her friends. She had met up with them before she had made this decision at Jackie and Ann’s home. They had all thought it was a bad idea and had told her as much. Gloria had assured the group she would be okay and that this needed to be done. In the end after much debate (and a promise from her friends that she wouldn’t make fun of their teenage appearances) they had relented to her request.<br />
<br />
“Your right Felicia it is dangerous,” she said. “But....considering everything that’s been going on with my sister over here it needed to be done. By the way, really great to see you all again. Forgot how much fun we all had when we were in high school.”<br />
<br />
“Enough with the trip down memory lane sis,” Lynne groaned. “Your here for a reason. Most likely because of what happened with mom. If it’s an apology your looking for forget, just go home.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t looking for an apology Lynne,” Gloria grumbled. “Mom told me all about what happened and how the young me tried to use the ring.”<br />
<br />
Lynne and Gloria’s eyes went wide as they looked at Gloria. Both feared this Gloria would reveal Lynne’s deepest fear. Lynne didn’t want to be embarrassed in front of everyone while Gloria feared Lynne would take out her anger on her and bind her magic. “Gloria,” Lynne warned her older sister. “Don’t.”<br />
<br />
The adult Gloria narrowed her eyes as she gazed at her little sister. She was well aware of Lynne&#39;s fear and how secretive she was about it. She also remembered the promise she had made when her and Lynne had been in the hospital. She did not want to break that promise, she was here to fix her relationship with her sister. The girl felt betrayed because of Morgan LeFay. The trick she had used was meant to isolate the girl and make her more susceptible to the sorceress’s influence.  If Gloria was going to regain her sisters trust she needed to be mindful of her feelings.<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” she said. “You have every right to feel the way you do,” she said sadly. “Everything you’ve had to deal with. Not being able to go home, mom just dropping in unannounced, me. I...I would of felt the same way, I came here to apologize and to talk.”<br />
<br />
“What,” Lynne said, a mixture of anger and confusion clouding her words.<br />
<br />
Gloria chuckled as she looked at the bemused look on her sisters face. “Yes Lynne I just wanted to talk,” she smiled. “And to apologize also, I never knew you felt like you needed to live up to me and Katie. You’re your own person Lynne. My spunky, prankster kid sister who’s a pain in the ass and who I absolutely adore.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a pain in the ass,” Lynne grumbled, causing the adult Gloria to smirk. “Fine just a pain,” she said. “Now will you stop so standoffish and give me a hug cause otherwise I’m coming over to hug you.”<br />
<br />
Lynne groaned as she approached her sister. Although the girl was frowning deep down she was happy to see her sister, she just didn’t want to show it. Wrapping her arms around her sister she sighed heavily as she buried her face into her sisters shoulder. “This doesn’t mean I’m happy to see you,” she mumbled.<br />
<br />
“I know kid,” Gloria smiled. “But I’m happy to see you so let’s talk.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others stared dumbfounded as the future Gloria and Lynne stood in a sisterly embrace. Despite Gloria having frozen the class, school was still in session. For now they had no choice but to see how things would work out.</p>
