<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was typing away, oblivious to the changes happening to him and Chris&#39; body. Chris came running up to Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan! Something&#39;s wrong I have to show you something!&quot;, he belted out in his slightly deeper voice. Ryan turned around and he gave his friend a puzzled look. &quot;What is it? And what&#39;s that on your lip dude?&quot;, Ryan asked in his similarly deepening voice, spying something dark on his friends lip. Chris ran to the small desk mirror in the room; &quot;oh no! What is this!&quot;, he cried.<br />
<br />
Chris could see he had more than a few scraggly hairs that had squirmed their way out of his upper lip. They were still mostly blonde and there weren&#39;t that many. It looked like a sad first attempt at a scraggly teen boy moustache. Still, he didn&#39;t have that hair yesterday, or even an hour ago.<br />
<br />
Chris turned to his friend; &quot;Dude, something&#39;s wrong! Remember when we came home and our voices started cracking. Well they sound a bit deeper now, right?&quot;. Ryan pondered, but didn&#39;t answer. &quot;Well&quot;, Chris continued, I noticed this in the bathroom&quot;. He took off his shirt, airing out his new bushes for Ryan to see. Ryan was shocked; Chris had some pretty large bushes sticking out from under his arm now. Moreover, he had a very small smattering of hair on his chest. &quot;What?! Chris had pit hair now?&quot;, Ryan thought. &quot;I saw him change for gym class today and he was totally smooth. And now chest hair too?!&quot;. Ryan also noticed his friend stunk a bit as well, but not as bad as Coach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, my chest and armpits have been itCHING all day&quot;, Chris remarked, his voice cracking again, settling into a slightly deeper range, &quot;have you noticed any strange feelings with your body?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Chris I have! My clothes have felt tight ever since we got home. And its only been GETTing WORse!&quot;, he stammered as his voice dropped yet again. Ryan stood up to examine his changes, and as soon as he was up it was fairly obvious he had changed.<br />
<br />
As Ryan stood up, he appeared to be at least 6 inches taller, and his shirt appeared painted on. There was about 4 inches between the waist band of his jeans and the bottom of his T shirt. You could see the beginning of a small but defined set of ads and a very small smattering of blond hair around his belly button. Ryan&#39;s shirt was also bulging around his small but defined biceps. &quot;Biceps? Ryan has never had biceps before! &quot;, Chris thought.<br />
<br />
Ryan peeled off his shirt, like Chris to compare the changes. Ryan had indeed gained an impressive range of lean but defined muscles. He had small but hard pecs, a good start on biceps, and slight abs. &quot;Holy shit! How are you all muscular all of a sudden!&quot;, Chris exclaimed. &quot;Speak FOR yourSELF&quot;, Ryan stammered, his voice breaking for a final time and finally settling in to a deep baritone permanently, giving him a bobbing and prominent Adams apple. Ryan gestured to Chris&#39; arms, which had biceps even larger then Ryan&#39;s now. Chris also noticed that he was starting to bulk up a bit. Not much, maybe a few pounds.<br />
<br />
Ryan spied Chris&#39; armpits again and curiously lifted his own. Ryan did indeed have armpit hair, too, but it was just a small blonde tuft; no where near what Chris had. Ryan also noticed, to no mild annoyance , that he now had body odor as well.<br />
<br />
Ryan adjust his crotch one last time, and decided he could take it any more. He took off his jeans and stood there in briefs. His previous assessment was wrong; his briefs hadn&#39;t shrunk, his package had ballooned in size. He peered inside his briefs and saw a huge python with egg sized balls. It was much much bigger then his old package. Also, his whole groin was covered in thick blonde pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell! Why does it seem we are getting older!&quot;, Chris stammered, examining a crop of new scraggly brown hairs growing out of his chin ; pretty soon he would need to shave. Looking down he also saw much more hair on his chest and all over his stomach. He glanced at Ryan, who still seemed quite smooth. Chris was jealous of this fact, as well as Ryan&#39;s impressive manhood. Chris reached into his pants. His member had certainly grown, but not nearly as big as Ryan&#39;s. Chris saw Ryan scratching his cheek and one of his armpits vigorously and then he felt his own package begin to heat up in his pants. He knew the changes were far from over.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy!&quot;, Chris stammered in a frightened deep voice. &quot;What are we going to do?!&quot;</p>
