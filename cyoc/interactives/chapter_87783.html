<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh picked his straw first, and sighed with relief when he picked the longest straw. Kyle was next up and picked one of the straws. Kyle let out a deep grunt of frustration as he saw that he held the shortest straw. “Alright”, explained Travis, “So Josh has to pick an embarrassing change to happen to Kyle”. <br />
<br />
Josh eyed Kyle up and down, trying to think of a good idea. Kyle was almost 6 and a half feet tall, and he looked like an adult. He was the team’s linebacker and he was very muscular and had a great deal of body hair. Glancing at Kyle’s bulging jockstrap, with tufts of dark and thick pubic hair peeking out from the fabric, gave Josh a few ideas. Moving his gaze up from the jockstrap, Josh was struck with an idea he liked. He saw how hairy Kyle’s armpits were; He had thick and wiry brown bushes nestled under each arm and a thick tuft stuck out even with his arms at his side. Josh also noticed Kyle’s pits stunk; they were producing rather strong body odor from the tough game they had just played. Josh finally decided on a change that would gross out and embarrass Kyle.<br />
“Alright, I have the change in mind”, Josh said as he walked over to the chronivac. He typed in a few entries to Kyle’s profile and hit Enter. There was a bright flash and Kyle felt a tingle in his right armpit. Kyle asked Josh “Hey, what did you change about me”, but stopped midway; His voice sounded like it was coming somewhere other than his face. Kyle reached his hands up to his mouth and, to his surprise, felt nothing but skin. Josh, amused at Kyle’s surprise, told him what he had changed; “Hey Kyle, I moved your mouth and put it underneath in your right armpit”. Kyle lifted up his arm, showing off his armpit. There was so much hair that Kyle had to part his bush in half to see his mouth. It was true! His mouth was nestled in his armpit underneath all of his hair. His armpit hair grew all around his mouth; everywhere except on the lips.<br />
<br />
“Dude, gross! Change it back!” Kyle yelled at Josh. “No dude, this is part of the game. When we draw straws again maybe you’ll have a chance to get back at me!”, Josh rebutted. Kyle, still with his arm up, made a spitting sound with his new mouth; “Gross! Every time I talk or open my mouth, I get armpit hair in my mouth. And to make it worse, I reek; I haven’t had a chance to shower after the game! Breathing through a sweaty, smelly armpit is about as pleasant as you would expect!”. Travis butts in this time; “Sorry Kyle, all part of the game man”.<br />
<br />
While Kyle adjusted to his new mouth placement, Josh and Travis examined the change up close. Travis held Kyle’s arm up and they both leaned in to get a better look at Kyle’s mouth. As they leaned closer to the thick underarm bush, Kyle’s body odor began to smell much stronger. “Man, Kyle, you fucking stink dude!”, Josh jokingly told his friend. Travis joined in on the fun for a bit; “Damn man, you can’t even see your mouth under all of this hair. Maybe if you trimmed your caveman bush once in a while you wouldn’t stink so bad!”. Kyle was getting a little annoyed and snapped at his friends; “Hey, you guys better be careful, or when it’s my turn, I’m going to get you guys good!”, Kyle yelled from his armpit. Josh and Travis began to laugh; every time Kyle spoke, his armpit hair was ruffled by his breath. They began to laugh even harder at the spitting noises Kyle after he spoke, trying to rid his mouth of some thick and curly stray hairs.<br />
<br />
Kyle’s face turned red from embarrassment; He had to admit, he was kind of humiliated that the change has made his body something freakish and gross. His mouth was itchy from all the wiry hairs brushing up against and sticking to his lips. It didn’t help that Josh and Travis were making fun of him as well. Kyle tried to lower his arm and close his armpit, but Josh grabbed his arm and held it up. Josh reached into Kyle’s armpit and grabbed a tuft of hair. Tugging on the hairs between his fingers lightly, Josh continues his joking; “Wow, Kyle, I didn’t know you were trying to grow a beard? It looks so good on you!”. Trevor and Josh continue laughing.<br />
<br />
After Josh and Trevor’s laughing fits had subsided, the three boys realized they were hungry. All three of the boys ripped open the pizza box in front of them, each grabbing a slice of pepperoni pizza. While Josh and Trevor devoured their slice, Kyle looked at the slice in his hand and hesitated; how would he eat his pizza? His stomach rumbled; hungry from the game tonight. He sighed and decided to just deal with his new change. He lifted up his right arm and forced the slice of pizza through his thick underarm bush and into his new mouth. <br />
<br />
Josh and Trevor looked over with curiosity and disgust. Kyle was shoving a slice of pizza into his armpit. He was smearing grease and pizza sauce all over his thick pit bush. After finally reaching his mouth, Kyle takes a few small exploratory bites of the slice. He was disappointed to find out that shoving a pizza through his armpit hair was a bad idea; Every bite he took, no matter how small, had at least 2 or 3 thick wiry pit hairs stuck to the pizza. Making spitting noises, the other 2 guys figured it out pretty fast; “Aww man, that’s not fair; Kyle got 2 more extra toppings we didn’t get!”, Josh said to Trevor. “He has the privilege of having stray armpit hairs and smelly old sweat to stick to his pizza as a topping!”. <br />
<br />
Kyle had had enough; “Alright guys, if you think this is so funny, than lets pull straws again! It’s time for you guys to get something changed”, he yelled, as he wiped pizza sauce and grease out of his bush with a napkin. Josh and Trevor looked at each other, and shrugged. “Okay, yea, lets pull some more straws!”</p>
