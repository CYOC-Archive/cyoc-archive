<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah really didn&#39;t know on what to decide on. In a way, she was insanely jealous of how Abby had turned out, and in fact the way all of the female uplifted animals turned out. On her hike she had seen a few of the other uplifted animals going about some variant of farm work, normally the stuff that she&#39;d seen Abby&#39;s father doing in the past. They were rearranging fences and so on, which made sense. In the past, the Brown family&#39;s Belgian Blue cattle had plots of grazing land, as did Samson and the other horses, but now that they were uplifted by the Animalia virus and a large number of cabins had been built behind the main barn and Brown family home for them and as they began to be more like humans than like mundane animals, their purposes changed. Sarah remembered that it looked like they were preparing to try and turn the grazing pastures in to wheat fields or from what she overheard from Samson when she arrived, orchards.<br />
<br />
From what Sarah had seen on her way out, the female Belgian Blues looked even bigger than Abby was, and while Abby looked leaner, more sleek, and in Sarah&#39;s opinion sexier than the uplifted cattle, the cows weren&#39;t exactly ugly either. She also remembered seeing all that Abby had gained, she was clearly stronger and faster, and when they had PE that day, Abby easily lead the other students in the laps around the high school&#39;s basketball court, and Abby didn&#39;t break a sweat doing it. She just went at a steady trot and her long legs covered the distance easily. Sarah felt some desire to be able to do that, to be strong and fast, and it wasn&#39;t as if Abby had lost who she was by becoming a horse. She demonstrated that while they had their first day in school. So, if there wasn&#39;t that much that made Animalians different from humans, would it be wrong to want to join? Everyone would be strong and fit, certainly solving the issues with obesity that was going around.<br />
<br />
However as she thought over the first day of school she remembered some of the other classes she shared with Abby. While Abby had gone from a shorter and skinny fourteen year old to sexy and muscular mare, she also had to have larger pencils and pens to deal with the reduced dexterity in her fingers, desks and chairs had to be higher to suit her height and not to mention stronger to support her muscular weight that came along with her increased height. At the same time, from what Sarah remembered seeing, while there was so much about Abby&#39;s transformation that was cool, it also seemed like Abby was walking on egg shells so as not to hurt someone. Sarah also worried about how her mother would react to things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why...?&quot; Sarah found herself asking to Mary Alice, or Malice, the nickname she preferred.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my bestest friend,&quot; Malice said with a smile and no hint of malice in her voice, &quot;sometimes... especially since I drank that water back at home... I&#39;ve felt like we&#39;re sisters, even if we didn&#39;t have the same mother. Drinking that milk... it made me feel strong, and while I&#39;d NEVER force it on you... I do want you to feel strong and happy. I don&#39;t want you to feel inferior to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see me as a sister?&quot; Sarah spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Malice answered, &quot;Even before I was uplifted... but now... that has only grown stronger. I love you, sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Sarah hadn&#39;t made her decision yet, she did feel touched by Malice&#39;s claim of sisterhood and wanted to hug her and let Malice know that she loved her dog too. However, as she came forward, she tripped over a rock that was hidden in the tall grass that they were standing in. Samson might have the idea of turning the area into an orchard, but between the work to build homes for the uplifted animals and get things worked out so that Animalia would have some at least basic economic stability meant that all of the work for everything hadn&#39;t been completed yet. That had left all the rocks other things to trip on in the grass, and Sarah managed to find a rock hidden in the grass as she moved forward to hug Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whuh...?&quot; Sarah gasped as she stumbled forward.<br />
<br />
Abby gasped and took a step to catch her friend while Malice dropped the milk canister she&#39;d carried and moved forward to catch Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah!&quot; Malice gasped as she moved forward and caught Sarah.<br />
<br />
Sarah felt Malice&#39;s strong arms wrap around her, but not before she stumbled face first into her former pet&#39;s right breast. Her fur was soft, as was her breast, but the impact soon brought finding Malice&#39;s nipple poking through her fur and touching her cheek. Soon after, Sarah felt something rather sweet drip down her cheek  and she almost instinctively swallowed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Alice?!&quot; Sarah spoke as pulled back slightly to see a couple of drips of milk leaking from Malice&#39;s breasts, &quot;You... you taste sweet...&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby stepped back and glanced over to Samson. Her stallion stood by quietly for the moment. A part of her felt a bit uneasy, as if a lot humans ended up transforming, that might lead to more hostile reactions from humanity, but she hadn&#39;t lost much when she became a mare and Samson was learning a lot from working her parents. So, it wasn&#39;t as if Animalia was dangerous to humanity in the way that many would think it was. She&#39;d keep her promise to her parents not to infect those who wouldn&#39;t want it, but she wasn&#39;t so certain with regard areas where someone wanted to join Animalia, which Sarah had seemed to want to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia, Sarah Wesley and Mary Alice &quot;Malice&quot; Wesley,&quot; Abby said politely as Sarah latched on to Malice&#39;s breast and began to suckle.<br />
<br />
Malice ignored the mare&#39;s comment and simply held Sarah to her.  Her grip on her nipple was firm enough to draw milk out of her breast, but soft enough as not to cause her pain. The flow of milk felt good and Malice did her best to stifle a heavy moan as Sarah continued to suckle. She felt especially glad that if Sarah was to change, that she&#39;d become a husky like her. They could really be sisters now,  and she looked down to see white fur beginning to grow on Sarah&#39;s hands and as her fingernails lengthened into short and stubby claws. She smiled along her muzzle and licked the top of Sarah&#39;s head as two black furred triangular ears began to poke through her black hair. Black and white fur was also beginning to grow on her face. Her forehead  and the area just to the sides of her eyes was growing black fur while the rest was growing white fur. That made Malice smile even more. Sarah wouldn&#39;t just be a fellow husky, but would be same coloration as Malice herself.<br />
<br />
Sarah could feel herself changing, but she couldn&#39;t stop. Mary Alice&#39;s milk was so sweet, and she had to have more. She barely noticed as her feet began to lengthen into a digitigrade paws, forcing her to kick her shoes off. She felt one ear turn at the sound of a snort which probably meant that she&#39;d kicked her shoes toward Abby or Samson. She felt a bit of discomfort in her panties and her shorts as her hips began to widen and as as fuzzy tail began to grow behind her. At first it created a small lump that Abby and Samson could see in Sarah&#39;s shorts. It steadily grew larger and larger until eventually a white tip poked out from the bottom of Sarah&#39;s shorts. Sarah now looked the way Mary Alice did after she had first drank from the infected water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sis,&quot; Sarah said to Mary Alice, &quot;but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d like some more?&quot; Malice asked, wagging her tail.<br />
<br />
She watched as Sarah managed to wag the tip of her own tail and give a very canine smile. Malice smiled back and offered Sarah her other breast. As Sarah began to suckle again, Malice did her best to keep from howling in pleasure, as Sarah&#39;s suckling from her breasts was actually arousing her a bit. Malice could also smell her growing arousal was also triggering similar responses from both Abby and Samson, but she couldn&#39;t pay attention to that, as now Sarah was beginning to grow and put on muscle. Malice also noticed that Abby&#39;s face was also maturing, looking more like an adult husky rather than a puppy.<br />
<br />
This growth was a bit more painful for Sarah as her body was now growing even more. She could feel her breasts swelling in size and severely testing the limits of the A cup bra she wore. Her growing butt, widening hips and growing leg muscles were straining her shorts and her panties as well. Her shirt was straining to contain her growing chest and upper body,  and it drove her on Sarah knew she was going to be just as well built as Malice was now and her eagerness for that was growing, and the more of Malice&#39;s milk that she drank, the closer to that she&#39;d get to. Then in a great sense of relief, her shirt and bra ripped and snapped off her, letting her breasts hang freely. Shortly after her shorts and panties also snapped and Sarah&#39;s transformation  completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now here I am,&quot; Sarah gave a smile as she stood up before Malice, an amazonian anthro husky of equal size  and strength to her former pet. Sarah felt quite good and felt power in her new form, likely similar to what Abby had felt when she changed. That made her wag her tail in happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sis,&quot; Malice smiled and the two hugged, their breasts compressed against each other, &quot;and you got to keep your human hair too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah broke the hug and raised a furry hand to feel that her hair was in fact still there. She also noticed that while her hand was paw like, it wasn&#39;t so much that she&#39;d be unable to write or do anything. She figured that she&#39;d still be very dexterous and since she and Malice were well smaller than Abby, things wouldn&#39;t need to be specially resized for them. Both of them were taller than an average woman but not so tall as Abby was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Sarah spoke, &quot;That&#39;ll help mom tell us apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention your different eyes,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;Malice&#39;s are blue... yours are still brown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you have no need to feel jealous,&quot; Malice hugged Sarah again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you could say that this was an accident and it&#39;d be true,&quot; Samson added.</p>
