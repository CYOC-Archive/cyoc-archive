<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen and Lakshmi walked their Prime Body out of the health office.  The bell had just rung and passing period had begun, meaning that they had missed their entire first period.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Jen&#39;s face dick swayed and her ass-breasts jiggled intensely.  When Lakshmi quietly groaned, Jen told her to hold off and take  a breather.  Jen reached out a soft hand and caressed Lakshmi&#39;s face on her stomach, fixing the glasses mounted on her ears.  Her touch felt kind of good to her as well.<br />
<br />
They had left Lakshmi&#39;s Old Body lying in the health office, where they would pick it up after lunch.  Lakshmi could see out of its eye on its right breast, but Jen couldn&#39;t, which signified that Lakshmi was more connected with the body then Jen.  If this was correct, it would explain why Lakshmi felt more pain then Jen with it (it felt like just a huge bruise to Jen) and why only she could control it and its limbs.  <br />
<br />
Jen had been given a blue mask by a nurse in the health office to cover her face-cock.  She sighed with her manly voice which came out of her lower ass.  The COVID-19 pandemic was waning and her school had just lifted the mask mandate.  This was unfortunate.  She instinctively rose her arm to brush away her hair before she realized she no longer had it.  A bit surprised, Jen put on the mask and barely wrestled the Latino dick into her mask, careful not to arouse it.  Should that happen, the mask would either rip or be drenched in pre-cum.<br />
<br />
Jen thought that the curse was cool, but dangerous.  She had gotten an unwilling body-mate seriously injured, and she needed to get Kyle to switch off the curse before she got more people hurt.<br />
<br />
Jen:  &quot;Lakshmi, I-&quot;<br />
Lakshmi:  &quot;Jen, don&#39;t worry, its okay.  I&#39;ve shared bodies with you before, remember?  Were friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen took a moment and once again realized that reality had changed to accommodate the curse.  She had to ask Kyle about this too, asking anyone else would be weird.<br />
<br />
Jen:  &quot;Are you feeling all-right?&quot;<br />
Lakshmi:  &quot;The nurses did the checkup and said that I, we, are okay.  Don&#39;t fret.  I&#39;ll start walking soon.&quot;<br />
Jen:  &quot;No-no-no-no.  I&#39;ll do the walking, you rest.&quot;<br />
Lakshmi:  &quot;Oh!  Thanks Jen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was curious about their past body-sharing experiences due to her power/curse, but she decided to hold off on any questions until later.<br />
She had, during the hour she and Lakshmi were in the health office, been sorting details out about the curse while Lakshmi slept.<br />
<br />
Apparently, all transformations reverted after 2 days.  At least Kyle was somehow merciful.  She would go to the attendance office during recess to see if he was here.  Then she would track him down.<br />
Also, for some reason, a trait swap had occurred instead of a part swap when she touched Carl, which could mean that Kyle probably added some hidden attributes to the curse, somehow.<br />
Another anomaly that occurred was when she and Lakshmi did not swap out any body parts but instead swapped the legs of the nurses who transported them.<br />
<br />
Kyle was a bringer of chaos.<br />
<br />
Jen had also tested her sexuality.  She was still straight.  She knew this for a fact because her ass-breasts&#39; pussy got wet and quivered with excitement when she looked across the room at Tony, who was sitting cross legged and shirtless on his own bed, tying her old blond hair into a bun.  She barely even thought about his pecs when it happened.  However, her dicks twitched too which meant she might be gay in the masculine sense . . .<br />
<br />
But Jen was truly bisexual.  She tested whether she was lesbian or not by looking at one of the nurses she and Lakshmi had inadvertently transformed when they were being transported - the nurse was clad in light blue scrubs, around 5 foot 4 tall, in her late 20s, and African American.  Though the scrubs concealed much, Jen could still see that she had around C-cups and a nice ass, which Jen remembered was not hers.<br />
The nurse was struggling to walk.  Her tall and supple fair-skinned legs and ass she had borrowed with her White coworker were facing backwards, so she was walking on her tippy-toes with her ass sticking out in front and her knees bent in the back, reminding Jen of an Ostrich.  Every time the nurse took a step, her ass strained against her lower scrubs, and it was beautiful.  When she turned to look at Jen, she waved and smiled warmly.  At that moment, Jen, entranced and very turned on, lurched back as her face-dick shot out a small bit of pre-cum, which she caught with her hand.  After washing everything, Jen just laid back and waited.<br />
<br />
The nurses wore long gloves and woke up Lakshmi to do the health testing on the Prime Body after they had completed treating Lakshmi&#39;s Old Body.  It was then that Lakshmi&#39;s mother, in her late 40s, and Jen&#39;s house&#39;s housekeeper/babysitter, Martha, in her 20s, both came into the health office to check up on the girls.  After yelling for a few minutes at a clueless Tony, they came to the bed to check up on the girls.<br />
<br />
Lakshmi Das was of Indian heritage and was as hard working as both of her parents, owners of a popular market in the city.   They were a middle-class household, and Lakshmi had 2 older brothers.  She was 16 years old, and was in her Junior year of high school, like Jen.<br />
<br />
Jennifer (Jen) Beck was the daughter of a lawyer, her mother, and a big-time real-estate agent, her father.  She was 16 and a half years old, and had a younger sister, an older sister, and an older brother who she didn&#39;t see much - he already had a home of his own and a girlfriend whom he had recently proposed to.  Her house was decently large.  Due to this and the fact that her parents intermittently needed to go on 2 to 3 week-long business trips, Jen&#39;s parents hired Martha Sanchez to take care of their three daughters.  Originally a directionless 21-year-old who had a hard upbringing, she was hired when Jen was 10.  Looking for a job since she had to drop out of college due to her lack of funds, she moved in with the Beck family to take care of the girls.  Growing attached to them, even to Jen&#39;s older sister Sara, a hard-core E-girl, Martha had become the girls&#39; caregiver, second mother figure, and perfect sister.  Martha didn&#39;t have any boyfriends or girlfriends, and had enough money to leave for college but instead stayed home and took online courses instead to be with the girls for longer.<br />
<br />
Martha had become good friends with Lakshmi&#39;s mother as Jen and Lakshmi had gotten into a pickle before.  According to them in their collective warning, the last time Lakshmi and shared bodies with Jen, their heads had both been attached to the end of 2 horsecocks which had erupted from Jen&#39;s crotch.  They barely kept themselves from completely losing it and spewing spunk all over the cafeteria until Martha, with Lakshmi&#39;s mother&#39;s help, drove them home, where they jumped outside and immediately pumped their load, or vomited it, into the drainage ditch.  Incredibly sticky, it took the four women an hour to scrub the sidewalk free of the cum, and by then Jen and Lakshmi&#39;s &quot;necks&quot; were stiff once more.<br />
<br />
After they left, the nurses gave Jen and Lakshmi&#39;s Prime Body and thumbs up and they walked out of the health office as the bell rang, announcing the end of the first period. <br />
<br />
So Jen continued to walk to her, or their, next class.</p>
