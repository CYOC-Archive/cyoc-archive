<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I play 'Enhancement: Perception, Inner Peace...Ecomancy', whatever the last bit means,&quot; said Tobi as the card fell from his hand and he shook his head.<br />
<br />
Lissy's face was a picture of anticipation as she stared down at the picture on the card. There, slipping lightly through a slyvan glade was the image of an impossibly elfin woman clad only in a trailing robe of leaves and flowers, her long hair of strawberry gold gathered in a loose braid which fell away down her back. Under the picture was one word: 'Dryad'.<br />
<br />
While the others leaned in closer to see the card, Lissy's face suddenly changed as if a feeling had swept over her and she raised her head above the others. Only Dina, who had been engaged in the act of learning to crawl on her tail saw her friend's head raised and she again read the look on her face, she knew that Lissy felt the change coming.<br />
<br />
For her own part, Lissy was exstatic with the idea that she was about to change into the slyph-like being on the card. Now she would have the grace to match Ryan and be far more exotic and desirable than a cry-baby mermaid with rabbit's ears. There was no way she wanted to end up looking like a reject from the Playboy Mansion's private menagerie.<br />
<br />
The first thing she felt was a sudden warmth in her stomach as her muscles seemed to begin to move of their own accord. She had been kneeling over the card, but she now found herself forced to pull away from the others and lay on her side as the tensing of her muscles became more intense. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden she felt a new sensation, a slight itching around her waist and she glanced down in anticipation of seeing her thighs fill out to the dimensions that the picture on the card seemed to promise. But instead she was shocked to see that the itching was coming from her panties, as they were inched down her thighs and emerged from the edge of her skirt right before her eyes.<br />
<br />
Just after the panties emerged into full view, Lissy saw somehting else that made her cry out inspite of herself. At this the others looked up from the card and then down at her as she lay there and stared at the point where her hips were slowly buit surely fusing together into one and forcing her underwear off her reshaped body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks to me like we could end with a harem of mermaids at this rate,&quot; said Tobi as he shot Dina a smile. Dina just stared at Lissy's legs and shook her head. &quot;The last time I checked, we mermaids had scales and fins...not shoots and buds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dina's bitcy comment threw Lissy into a panic as she writhed on the floor of the room trying to get a better look at what she was becoming. Tobi hurried round behind her and lifted her shoulders off the floor. As soon as she was upright, Lissy grabbed her skirt and yanked it up to reveal the green stem that was quickly replacing her legs. From the waist down and as far as her knees, she had become a member of the plant kingdom and the change showed no signs of stopping for the loss of her modesty and had even begun to creep up her stomach as well.<br />
<br />
No one spoke as they sat and watched the progress of Lissy's transformation. Inch by inch the panties were pushed further down her new stalk until they and her ankle socks were left dangling from the broad spread of roots that burst forth from the tips of what had once been her feet. <br />
<br />
Finally she elbowed Tobi away and began to explore the feeling of her new shape, both hands probing and exploring the soft but firm expanses of green that spread away below her waist. The change had left her shape unchanged and the stem enjoed the same shapely curves which had been characteristic of Lissy's legs. Her feet on the other hand, were gone for good, replaced by a solid mass of roots at the bottom of her stem. She gazed at and them whistfully at the shoes she ahd left by the door, thinking of the expense and glamour she could now never show off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dina chimed up, &quot;if we ever play a game of 'animal, vegetable or mineral' this sure screws things up!&quot; She was getting a good deal of revenge in the aftermath of Lissy's departure from the order mamillia.<br />
<br />
Lissy opened her mouth to fire back and could manage only a gasp as she suddenly felt the grip of the worst thirst she had ever expereienced in her life. She held out a hand desperatly and appealed to her friends for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter with her?&quot; siad Ryan in a haughty tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she sick?&quot; asked Dina.<br />
<br />
Tobi glanced down at her exposed roots and leap to his feet. &quot;I'll be right back,&quot; he said as he dashed out of the room.<br />
<br />
He reappeared a minute later manhandling a large sack and a sizable terracotta pot through the door and immediatly set about yanking Lissy round so that her roots disappeared into the pot. Next he shovelled handfuls of earth from the sack in around them until it covered her to the base of her stem. Ryan, who had caught on to what was the problem, suddenly sloshed a pail of water onto the earth and together they hauled Lissy upright and held her there.<br />
<br />
As the water soaked into the earth, Lissy felt it reach her roots and them pull it in and up the length of her stem. It was an intense experience and reminded her of her first orgasm, and just like that the terrible thirst was gone.<br />
<br />
Ryan and Tobi gently sat her down on the edge of the bed and watched as she peered down the collar of her top and surveyed the green tinge that had setteled over her breasts, but stopped shy of her arms and neck.<br />
<br />
Dina had hauled herself onto the bed and the two sat next to each other, like creatures from different elements, each looking the other up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Dina, &quot;looks like the storybooks got Dryads all wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lissy nodded, &quot;too much elf and not nearly enough oak, from where I'm sitting.&quot;</p>
