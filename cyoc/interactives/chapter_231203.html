<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lady Zhen was fairly amused by some of the things that went on with Heiya Island&#39;s embrace of things like Songkran. It wasn&#39;t a typically Chinese or Japanese celebration, but then, as she&#39;d learned, much of the island had become something of a refuge for many people from across Asia and thus having those that did celebrate it. Though, the things that brought her the most amusement was how many elements of Heiya Island&#39;s version was heavily adapted to suit both modern takes on old traditions and providing something that was fun for Animalians that had been uplifted, and thus weren&#39;t always familiar with Human traditions. Some things couldn&#39;t be changed, as some of the days for the festival did fall on weekdays, and those that went to &quot;Samurai Prep&quot; had school during the day, but those were things to be expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is most amusssing,&quot; Lady Zhen commented as she, Yu, and Na sat and watched some of the water ballon fights one afternoon, and noting Muxing, Li-Wei, and Fang go after the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties as part of the battle.<br />
<br />
The group had set themselves up in a spot where they were in a dry zone, though also near the main runway for the airfield that pretty much split the island in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have gone with the snake team, we wouldn&#39;t have stopped you,&quot; Na said to Lady Zhen.<br />
<br />
Lady Zhen shifted her eyes to follow Muxing and Li-Wei as they moved. A part of her was tempted, but she also knew that there were some underlying romantic bonds that were there between the two... or between Muxing and one of Li-Wei&#39;s heads, if their different personalities counted as two different Animalians in one body. And while the species of snake she&#39;d become was similar to Muxing and Li-Wei&#39;s species, they weren&#39;t the same. The Human, Fang, joining them was also interesting, but Lady Zhen didn&#39;t want to pry.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I wouldn&#39;t want to get in the way of their romanccce,&quot; Lady Zhen spoke, &quot;besides, I&#39;m comfortable to rest here and observe all the changes that have gone in the world and how the residents of this island have adapted to different traditions and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And not hedging bets on old traditions?&quot; Yu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I left that to you two,&quot; Lady Zhen gave a smile and thought back on the last sessions in Lyre/Animalia as her group of elderly women, all victims of old traditions in China that had left them with Lotus Feet...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
By now the Horizon Building was a familiar sight as Lady Zhen pushed Yu&#39;s wheelchair. Na walked a bit behind them but was using a walker to maintain her stance through good upper arm strength. Lady Zhen was quite impressed with Na on that basis. As they were often expected to be trim and demure, and of course, submissive to their husbands. To a great degree, even the People&#39;s Republic didn&#39;t change a lot of that. The one thing that was truly different was that by now, those that had been part of the group were old enough that fears of rebelliousness or anything else wouldn&#39;t be an issue anymore. Becoming Animalians might reawaken those fears, but it was also viewed as something to clean up issues that related to what had been done to them. Thus, the Chinese government accepted &quot;Project Phoenix&quot; as a means to remove reminders of past mistakes.<br />
<br />
And so far, becoming Animalians hadn&#39;t inspired much in the way of &quot;rebellion.&quot; They may not have had great love for the present government, and privately, even Chang had no problem with criticizing the government. But none of them had really looked to rebellion or anything of that nature. The government had shown itself to be more than capable and very willing to kill dissidents, and they weren&#39;t becoming Animalians to be part of a revolution. They might accept Heiya Island as a sort of &quot;refuge,&quot; but that would be about it. The rest was more filling out the Zodiac Wheel in how many in their group had become species that had either recently been part of Animalia&#39;s celebration of the Lunar New Year or would be part of upcoming years. Lady Zhen was on the fence with regard to competing in the Year of the Snake, but it was an option. Eventually they would get to animal in the zodiac that could have some confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two are sssure with your choicessss?&quot; Lady Zhen asked, working hard to make sure she didn&#39;t hiss any word that would have anything that had an &quot;s&quot; in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yu answered, &quot;fill out the representatives of the Chinese Zodiac that Animalia doesn&#39;t have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there are a couple of ssssheep and goatsss here and there,&quot; Lady Zhen answered, &quot;though... not many.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which was true. Most of the livestock that had been uplifted in Animalia initially had been the cattle and horses on the Brown Farm and some of the adjoining ranches. But the Browns didn&#39;t have sheep or goats, and many of those that were uplifted animals came later. Often with sentimental owners who had bonded with a particular animal and didn&#39;t want to see it die. Most of the rest were converted Animalians who had other reasons. Lady Zhen didn&#39;t look too deeply into this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we&#39;ll be going for the sheep and goats, filling out the yáng,&quot; Na said, &quot;and a Nubian Goat for me. And one that&#39;s mostly black with white legs and face. From some of the notes, it won&#39;t be a perfect color pattern, and might actually have a fair amount of white in it... but it should have enough black to be mostly black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would balance with my becoming a Valias Blacknose,&quot; Yu spoke, &quot;we&#39;d be the perfect yin and yang symbol together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leaving people wondering between ssh&#257;nyáng and miányáng,&quot; Lady Zhen quipped.<br />
<br />
The quip earned a few chuckles, but not much more. For as they arrived the last bits of paperwork and things were to be finished. Horizon did require that those converting present some instinctual knowledge on the animal in question, and the only work arounds with it was if their conversion was being handled by a lover or potential lover. With no &quot;lovers&quot; present, that meant that Yu and Na had to write out as much as they could. Thankfully, that business was handled well in advance and once approved, Horizon would send the approved request along with the selected dates for the conversion to be handled. Yu and Na chose to go together, and Lady Zhen had come along as something of a chaperone, before they agreed to settle into things at Heiya Island, or possibly one of the other islands in that &quot;prefecture&quot; as they opened up for settlement.<br />
<br />
Of course, Lady Zhen was a bit surprised by how much leeway that she was being given, or that she was even the one to be in “supervision” of things with regard to the others. After all, before she became a White-Lipped Pit Viper Animalian, she’d been dealing with the pain of Lotus Feet and was also in the same age group as the others. She’d also had no governmental experience, and yet the officers that met with her before her conversion and then as she set about the conversion for the others seemed to be fine with it. Though the oddity of it soon became conversation while Yu and Na went through their conversions. Mostly as a result of Doctor Stein being there for the conversions at this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these two are the last that were with you?&quot; Doctor Stein asked to Lady Zhen in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last that I was assssigned to look after,&quot; Lady Zhen answered with a shrug, &quot;strange that they would trusst an old woman with no party tiess... but, I get the sensse they&#39;re just happy to ssee one embrassssment end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that?&quot; Doctor Stein wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heiya Island... and the Animalian colony there,&quot; Lady Zhen replied, &quot;asss they&#39;ve had to allow more rights on what iss Japanessse territory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bad place... and one that might offer room for something more peaceful for the future,&quot; Doctor Stein commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can allow for the Lunar New Year parties to be full in the future,&quot; Lady Zhen commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be a shame no one went with a Dinotopian... you&#39;d actually get a discount on that THIS year,&quot; Doctor Stein commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mossst of thosse in my generation know of dinosssaurssss would be with thosse that are too big,&quot; Lady Zhen replied, &quot;we&#39;re all fine with what we became.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded at that, just as a tap was heard through the door to one of the conversion rooms. The walls and things were largely soundproof, mostly a result of the upgrades that came in after Horizon found a decent market for Animalian conversions, and that there were some cases where couples would come in to become Animalians. The only place where sounds from within the conversion rooms could easily be heard was at the door, and that was often a sign more that the new Animalian had either finished transforming and was ready... or at least in a stable enough state that they wouldn&#39;t be a real threat. Lady Zhen slid back on her tail to let Doctor Stein move to open the door while also moving with one hand to collect the plastic box that contained the vaccination shots for the Animalia Virus.<br />
<br />
The door opened to reveal Na standing there in her old clothes, though they were stretched a bit more than they normally were over a larger bust line and wider hips, but so far as Lady Zhen could tell, it wasn&#39;t as though Na was fully prevented from doing anything with her new form. She looked younger and likely more energized, so far as what Lady Zhen could see. Na had no horns and her ears drooped down, but she did have a lot of the color pattern that she&#39;d suggested. A white face, hands, and feet, though it wasn&#39;t even and much of her black fur vanished underneath her clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think, Zhen?&quot; Na asked, &quot;think this would win the Year of the Sheep/Goat when it comes up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d give you a chanccce,&quot; Lady Zhen answered, &quot;Though, Yu may give you a good run for your money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Along with the others in Lyre/Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;We don&#39;t have many Domestic Sheep and Goats, but I believe there are a few Rocky Mountain Goats and Bighorn Sheep that were part of the Lyre Zoo in the initial outbreak... and most Americans that have become &quot;sheep&quot; have looked to be Bighorn. And among the Animalian Colonies, we have at least two Pyrenean Ibex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could make for an interesting contest, then,&quot; Lady Zhen spoke carefully and managing to avoid hissing.<br />
<br />
And the same sort of applied for Yu. Her wool was a bit longer, but she did fit in her clothes and looked pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may want to go down to the groomer,&quot; Doctor Stein commented to Yu as he delivered the vaccination shot, &quot;our warm weather season is approaching, and I&#39;d imagine that the same will apply for Heiya Island. Shorter wool will let you keep cool. To a degree, you could also then sell it for wool and yarn sales.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Yu, &quot;right now... I&#39;m just enjoying being able to stand without feeling pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good too, and I wish you all the best,&quot; Doctor Stein finished.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And will you be training for the Year of the Snake, next year?&quot; Yu asked to Lady Zhen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking on it,&quot; Lady Zhen commented, &quot;though... that one is also going to be tighter, given all the Snake Animalians that are there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d do well...&quot; Na commented, &quot;as you&#39;ve overcome a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in some ways, the contest celebrates a lot of Chinese traditions and brings in new ones with an Animalian flair to them,&quot; Yu added, &quot;like the two Velociraptors diving under a Sauropod.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... new and old altogether,&quot; Lady Zhen smiled, &quot;Good to see.&quot;</p>
