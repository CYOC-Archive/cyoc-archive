<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric had said he had to piss, but it had only been a gamble to get back to his room and try and recollect himself and come up with some sort of strategy. His pipsqueak little brother was now, by virtue of an idle wish his older brother. In the flash of a light he&#39;d lost sixteen years of his life and now was back to... what, first grade? Eric shuddered at the thought. He remembered first grade all too well--how there&#39;d been a bunch of older second graders who&#39;d chase him on the playground--just for the fun of locking him up in the games shed and hearing him yell and cry as he&#39;d pounded on the inside of the shed. How weak and little he&#39;d been then. It&#39;s why he&#39;d been so focused on his body as he&#39;d gotten older--because he&#39;d refused to be that little and weak again. No one was going to push him around, he&#39;d vowed... and now, now his pipsqueak little brother had just made him little and weak and pushed him around. He couldn&#39;t let that stand, no! He had to show he was still the big brother!<br />
<br />
It was then Eric felt a chill on his cheeks and brought up his hand to his face and found it stained wet with tears. Fuck, he was already crying like the baby he looked like. He had to get a grip on himself. He&#39;d toughened up before, he had to get a control over his little boy emotions. Eric wiped his cheeks with his arms, however the tears still kept coming, and he began to hiccup--oh no. Whenever he&#39;d cried too much he always started hiccuping. It had been something his mother had exclaimed was cute and endearing about him, which is why he had militantly tried doing anything to keep himself from crying too much, but his feelings, his wild scared emotions at being so much smaller, of being so weak, were too much. He tried punching his bed, that had always worked before, but it only brought on more tears and more hiccups, because his twin-sized bed now made him feel so little and small. Pretty soon, Eric gave up punching his bed--it wasn&#39;t doing anything anyway--and he buried his head onto the Sesame Street print of the sheet, finding some soothing comfort in the warm yellow color of Big Bird.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute, Big Bird?? That had been pipsqueak&#39;s old bedspread. Eric managed to collect himself enough to pull his head back from his bed, to see it was still a twin, but now bed rails had appeared where they hadn&#39;t, and his bed sheets had transformed from the cheap, but adult looking silver set he&#39;d bought from Wal-mart with his own money, to the bedspread that had been on pipsqueak&#39;s bed until he had started Kindergarten.<br />
<br />
Startled at the transformation that had occurred to his bed, in shock, he looked around his room more. Gone were the trophies and photos from his years of football, basketball, and baseball, replaced with toys, a mix of stuff he&#39;d had the first time he&#39;d been six and stuff he distinctly remembered Jason having. Gone was the basketball net he&#39;d set up on the back of his door, replaced with a plastic Fisher Price toy model. Gone was the cheap adult furniture he&#39;d bought with his own money when he&#39;d redone his room himself, replaced with some of his old furniture he&#39;d replaced and a few others which looked like newer models of what he&#39;d had the first time around. Quickly, Eric ran to his dresser--pink and blue, because his parents had wanted to be prepared no matter whether he&#39;d been born a boy or girl--and opened it to find his clothes all gone, replaced with a mixture of his old wardrobe that his mother had donated to charity years ago, or newer updates since then. Like his Kindergarten class shirt now having the most recent year on it, rather than the one from 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
It was then that Eric felt a chill around his bottom. Up until now, his wife-beater had gone down to his ankles, but now, as he looked down he noticed that it had adjusted to his size and turned into a regular plain white t-shirt, which barely hid his baby gut, let alone go further down than that. He was now plainly buck naked from the waist down.<br />
<br />
Frightened, at what was all around him was evidence that his old life was slowly van... van... gone, Eric began panicking, the hiccups still coming, but now he wasn&#39;t crying, he was too scared to cry. If his room had changed, what else had changed? Would he keep changing? Would he start to think like a little boy? He wasn&#39;t a little boy. He was a big boy!<br />
<br />
The moment he&#39;d thought that, his mind reeled back in horror. It was happening, he was starting to really become the little brother he looked like. It was then he heard a knock on the door, followed by his Momm--Mother. He had to fight to keep his older thoughts, as long as he could still think like a sixteen-year-old, he could still go back to being one, he reasoned. His mother came in holding a shrunken version of the sweat pants and underwear he&#39;d been wearing when he&#39;d been playing with his pee--penis. Gosh this was going to be harder than he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, you had another accident,&quot; said his mother, and Eric looked to see that the cum which he had accidentally dripped onto his sweats when he&#39;d tried climbing off the couch, had now turned into pee-piss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mom&quot; He fought with every ounce of willpower he still had left to not add &quot;my&quot; onto the end.<br />
<br />
Mom looked shocked, as though she&#39;d been expecting the &quot;Mommy&quot;--and she likely would have been, as he&#39;d called her Mommy up until second grade when he&#39;d called her such in front of one of his friends who&#39;d teased him mercilessly afterwards. A closer look at Mother revealed she looked at least a decade younger herself--which made sense in an odd way to Eric. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call me?&quot; asked his mother, seemingly trying to put aside her shock that he&#39;d not called her Mommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted ta change myself... like&quot; uh oh, what to say? &quot;Like Jason does.&quot; Inwardly, Eric cringed, but that was about the only thing he could say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Eric, honey, you want to be a big boy like your brother?&quot; cooed his mother, her shock now being replaced with that annoying look of endearment, as though she were about to pull out her phone and snap a picture to preserve the moment. Eric shuddered at the thought.<br />
<br />
Eric, not trusting his mouth to not slip up and add a lisp or some other word, simply nodded his head and opened one of the other drawers where his underwear had been kept. He opened it to find cartoon briefs to greet him, though beneath them, he saw a pair or two of what looked to be plain briefs. He reached down and grabbed at one, causing the pairs above them to come tumbling out the drawer, but he didn&#39;t care, he just wanted to stop feeling chilly down below. With his mother as an audience, he stepped into the briefs and pulled them up to give him the modesty he&#39;d wanted the moment his mother had burst into his room. His mother, thankfully, had restrained herself to not pull out her phone or to come over and help him, but instead had crossed her arms and watched as he went through his drawers and pulled out a small pair of gym shorts and stepped into them with as much ease. When he&#39;d finished, sure half his wardrobe was on the floor in front of it, but he felt like he&#39;d proven not just to his mother, but to himself that he wasn&#39;t the paste eating six-year old he looked like.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a bit messy, Eric, but it might be time for you to start picking out your own clothes to wear,&quot; said his Mom as she came over, knelt in front of him, and gave him a hug, which at once shocked and comforted him. Shocked him as another reminder of just how small he&#39;d gotten, and comforted him to have the large warm arms to pull him close and safe to his Mommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;ll clean up the mess you&#39;ve made here, and next time you have an accident, don&#39;t just leave the clothes in the living room and go running around nakie through the house,&quot; scolded his mother rather lightly. Again, not trusting his mouth to not slip up, he dutifully nodded and then scampered out of the room, only to run straight into Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, watch where you&#39;re going... pipsqueak,&quot; taunted Jason after Eric had knocked them both over.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t, but the sly smile on Jason&#39;s face told him everything he needed to know, and Eric shook with anger as he began flailing to get back at Jason, but as soon as he had, Jason began to laugh as he began to roll, causing Eric to sense he was about to be pinned again--no! Eric quickly sat up and placed himself up on Jason&#39;s chest in an effort to keep him from using his upper body to help with the roll, but Jason&#39;s longer legs proved powerful enough on their own that Eric went flying off of Jason&#39;s chest and was sent across the hall into the living room where he was suddenly stopped by something hard and painful before he blacked out as he heard his mother scream.</p>
