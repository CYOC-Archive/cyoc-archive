<br />
Penny just hoped the mother in her memory had been joking about 'testing out' Kirk.  She <br />
remembered Madam Serenity speech about how broad the term 'civilized' could be, and <br />
that made her sick inside fearing her family would lose their endearment to each other. But <br />
the thought of using the game to become Pen again and Kirk Kathy again strangely felt <br />
alien, maybe it was the curse, maybe it was a desire to just move foreword, or maybe <br />
reality itself didn't want to go to the trouble of putting things back the way they had been <br />
after going through all the trouble and over time and hard work to make the current <br />
species and injuries of all those involved by the curse fit...  Penny found herself wishing she <br />
knew. <br />
<br />
She felt she was on a death clock. Normally from what she remembered from police <br />
training on the nature of the game that people whose reality changed was instantaneous or <br />
was completely oblivious for all parties involved. This was nothing like that. She had <br />
WATCHED in full notice, and she could tell Kirk had too, as her parents had mutated into <br />
giant, muscular naked lions that had gotten thumbs and learned how to walk upright... oh <br />
and had apparently learned not to eat other sapient beings. The mere thought of that made <br />
her sick... 'The thing that makes us human is our empathy! Animals don't care about each <br />
other! It's all about your DNA making it to the next generation with them! They don't love <br />
each other... sex is just reproduction to them... everything alive is either a food source, a <br />
rival for a food source, for something that sees you as a food source... if we stop being <br />
able to empathizes with others then we stop being human!' Penny looked down at her furry <br />
breasts, 'Whatever human means anymore...' <br />
<br />
Penny felt humiliated and much like a cub as Mother Glenn did indeed carry her on her <br />
back of her grandmother, or was that ancestral grandmother now? Or was she now <br />
grandmother to several leomens? ' Ugh! These memories feel like even they aren't sure! I <br />
can't remember Mother Glenn ever walking on two legs... but I why do I remember seeing <br />
faded black and white photos of her on two legs looking like a beauty queen?... Why would <br />
the 'true love' part of my transformation make her even older than before and be in better <br />
shape than some other leomens my age?... Ugh!'  <br />
<br />
A person's lifespan, in fact any living thing's lifespan, was suppose to be determined by the <br />
preset number of times the cells in a person's body could divide, supposedly a safeguard <br />
against cancer and to insure a species kept reproducing and kept shuffling the gene pool <br />
to ensure a race kept adapting to it's environment. <br />
<br />
Penny tried to figure out if that could have anything to do in the slightest with why her <br />
granny was now a four legged beast... but it just made her head hurt more. 'Wasn't my life <br />
complicated enough already?'<br />
<br />
Mother Glen had said simply, &quot;We're going to Wolf Manor to check up on our injured <br />
packmates.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff, Gloria, Maxell, and Sonia had all but dropped what they were doing, and fallen in <br />
formation behind her without so much as a word. Penny was apparently excused for not <br />
doing so since her legs were useless for the time being but Kirk got several glares from his <br />
parents and future in laws and quickly joined in feeling an underlying compulsion to go <br />
along with Mother Glen's decision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kirk, you hold onto Penny's wheel chair, son, Sonia, help Penny onto me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother Glenn.&quot; They obeyed their Matriarch and lifted Penny out of her Wheel chair <br />
taking care with her legs as they laid her on Mother Glenn's marked back carefully like she <br />
was a lady riding a horse.  A very very big horse, with a mind of her own, which <br />
commanded respect and author by her sheer presence from anything with whiskers. <br />
<br />
The lions then simply walked out of the house, locking it, and following behind Mother <br />
Glenn like a entourage. <br />
 <br />
Penny couldn't believe they were simply STROLLING to Wolf, Smith, WHATEVER Manor... the <br />
same place Penny had not three days ago been preparing to storm in a do or die battle to <br />
save the brainwashed slaves of another punk who had gotten hold of the game with <br />
delusions of godhood.  And her mother! Her mother walking down the sidewalk naked, <br />
taller than any man Penny saw, and not complaining or thinking about in the least that the <br />
long beautiful hair that been Sonia's biggest vanity was totally and completely gone!  Not <br />
to mention how she was holding dad's rear in public... <br />
<br />
'Isn't anyone going to even say anything about us being naked-?!'  If lions were living in a <br />
human cultures, shouldn't that mean logically they'd be expected to abide by human <br />
culture's expectation and obligations-!?' Penny wondered if it had to do with their fur being <br />
able to hide things... but if fur DID cover parts people normally found improper, that <br />
undermined their biological function didn't it?' The only clothes Penny had found in Kirk's <br />
parents' house was some very formal attire... she had tried some on to find it was very very <br />
itchy...  'You THINK they could come up with clothes that didn't agitate skin with fur!' She <br />
remembered how she had wheeled outside and felt she was going to cook in it before she <br />
put it back,  'Or breathed enough so I didn't end up simmering in my own juices!' <br />
<br />
Penny sighed, glade her grandmother and parents could see her face from this position <br />
that looks so much like theirs. Penny looked around, it was still the Glendale she knew as <br />
far she could tell... the same road signs, the same stop lights, the same prices for things, <br />
the same tacky gift shop, the same occasional tourist trap invented by city hall to pull in <br />
revenue. One blogger she remembered had joke Glendale's major export was petrified <br />
teenage girls first and farm produce second...  That had always given Penny a sick feeling... <br />
and was one of the reasons a lot of art collectors in Glendale liked to keep their collections <br />
local and not sell off their stuff to people out of county.  On the tinny, tiny off chance that <br />
a PERSON could be the true identity of that piece of rock... of course there were plenty of <br />
bastards who saw that as a reason to sweep the existence of the game under the rug... <br />
don't want to scare away buyers after all.... the smarter ones saw it as a golden chance to <br />
sue like crazy anyone who was caught doing such a thing for loss of property... loss of <br />
property... UGH! That sounded so much like slavery it was enough to make Penny almost <br />
vomit. <br />
<br />
The one who was drawing the most attention she could see was herself... and that wasn't <br />
from being a humanoid lion, being naked, or riding a giant lioness, it was from being <br />
currently crippled... And still Penny knew that red and white cub was going to be there... <br />
Penny in her gut knew... Not to mention those gargoyles who had also been victims of the <br />
curse... and apparently ...had there been something else? Things had happened so quickly <br />
that things had quickly spun out of control... and then she went to free Kathy.. and she <br />
woke up to find the final battle had apparently happened without her if everything around <br />
her was to be believed. 'Not fair.' She thought, 'I should have been there for them...' Then <br />
she remembered, 'At least I was there for Kirk... even if I failed miserably to protect him... <br />
some lioness I am...'   All those statues... they had been people with lives... now <br />
assimilated into the mass of the big bad wolves... and she had failed to protect them... she <br />
was a police office! Protecting others was her job! That was why she never had turned a <br />
blind eye to the curse! Had never pretended it didn't exist! Because she knew that didn't <br />
really help the victims... <br />
<br />
The seven lions, no, seven leomans entered the high pay district of town and again Penny <br />
saw it hadn't appeared to really chance, not that she had exactly been in this part of town <br />
every day, she didn't work this part of the streets. <br />
<br />
But she saw Wolf Manor only... it was much larger than Penny remembered it being... the <br />
land devoted to it, the sheer size of the mansion itself... it had more than doubled in size! <br />
<br />
&quot;And the rich get richer.&quot; It came out of Penny's mouth purely reflex. <br />
<br />
Penny felt Mother's Glenn's tail swat on her behind. Causing her a yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't be rude Penny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny looked at the giant beast that was now her grandmother... the woman had acted as <br />
if Penny had just insulted a lifetime friend... She looked at Kirk, who was clearly thinking <br />
the same question, 'What has the curse done? What is the curse doing-?!' <br />
<br />
Penny behind a rather impressive looking gate looking made to without an all out assault <br />
from a swat team van. <br />
<br />
Jeff without even having to be told came up besides his mother and pressed the button for <br />
the intercom, &quot;Mother Glen is here to see her pack, open for her.&quot; <br />
<br />
With so many people currently doing medical recovery, no one was watching the gate <br />
security at the moment, (that was normally Jasmine's job), Kira however, did hear the <br />
voice... and feeling out fate felt she meant no real harm and rewrote her statue existence <br />
without greatly changing her outward appearance so wiring from the house ran through <br />
her via some hidden buttons on her person and opened the gate up herself.  <br />
<br />
Penny being carried in on top of her grandmother, the last thing she expected to see was <br />
Mary and a bunch of brightly colored wolf pups playing ... and a stacked sparkly purple <br />
she-wolf and a silver with red-orange highlights she-wolf with multiple arms, a giant <br />
black and gold wolf bigger than some movie monsters... and... a naked white wolf cub girl <br />
with red markings on her body that looked like brush strokes... 'How.... how did I even <br />
know what she looked like?... We talked OVER THE PHONE! I should have no clue what she <br />
looks like.... nothing makes sense anymore...' Penny though miserably. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Reality as a rule followed the path of least resistance, making thing stick together in the <br />
least confusing and contrived way possible in theory.  For this reason, the twins adopted <br />
by Anne had been in the original timeline when they were single people, human, and in <br />
Toni and Paula's case male, had in fact grown up without their parents for the most part, <br />
one crossing the border criminally, the other legitimately. <br />
<br />
How did Martha, Joy, Ingrid, Whitney, Abdul, Maddex, and Ryan's marriage work?  That was <br />
a very good and surprising confounding question to answer. If Alpha Jensen removing the <br />
prefixes had been considered racial - some of the pack in fact considered it a stripping of <br />
a piece of their individual identity- ... then Martha's union was considered by many of the <br />
pack to be down right sacrilege!<br />
<br />
The fact that the omegas had been allowed to breed wasn't a problem and hadn't been a <br />
problem for a hundred years... what -was- the problem was that Martha's union <br />
completely broke what was considered a normal and healthy dynamic of a sub-pack union <br />
by having multiple male partners! The fact male lupmen were expected to have multiple <br />
female partners but not the other way around at first glance seemed sexist and had been <br />
used a ammunition for sexist individuals in the past. But it did have some basic logic, after <br />
all, once a male impregnated a female his job was done for about ten-eleven months or <br />
so.... But a female could only be impregnated by one male at a time, thus it was like <br />
shooting all your bullets at one balloon at the carnival from the wolf perspective. <br />
<br />
While there were technically more females in the 'big bad mess' as some had nicknamed it <br />
behind the omega's backs, and sometimes more honorably to their faces... the fact that all <br />
three males pretty much considered themselves to be Martha's was disorienting. That Ryan <br />
had yet to father any children, and that Joy was also childless many considered the omega's <br />
massive combined union to be proof of an experiment that just didn't work. <br />
<br />
Martha, Whitney, and the twins Ingrid and Joy were all supposed to have been wed to Ryan <br />
was was lupman tradition.  They were all omegas after all, it was a tradition, while there <br />
was nothing on the books anymore preventing them from breeding with the other wolves <br />
of higher rank under Jensen, the omegas had just felt more comfortable breeding with <br />
wolves of their own status, declared outdated or not. Ryan had been a hard worker, loyal, <br />
attentive, diligent, that was when it was found out that Martha was pregnant with Abdul's <br />
child, as was Ingrid. It had been a formal agreement between the competing males that <br />
whoever had ever successfully blessed Prime Omega Martha with pups first was to be her <br />
male...  <br />
<br />
And the little fact that divorces were completely unheard of among the pack in the sense <br />
human beings knew them, fights for the right to breed and rank within the pack had been <br />
progressively made less bloody. However, due to these ritualization, it had added a sub-<br />
clause that now came into play hard... Ryan had done nothing technically to WARRANT <br />
being challenged! Before one could declare a challenge just because... now one actually just <br />
cause!  Bound by their word, in the most awkward situation imaginable, Abdul was married <br />
to the four females as well... then things got worse. <br />
<br />
Whitney was also pregnant... with Maddex's pups... at this point the pack's general opinion <br />
of the Omegas and of Beta-Julie's competence had taken a nose dive. It took years for <br />
Beta-Julie to regain the trust of her pack-mates that she was in fact a good doctor... <br />
<br />
While Alpha Jensen had certainly revised the rules and laws of the pack with the pest of <br />
intentions, and in fact the pack had become more community minded than military minded <br />
than since it's founding, the decrees of the Alpha Male had also created several 'run time <br />
errors' within the pack's internal code of law. <br />
<br />
And so bound with no other honorable course of action open to him, Maddex too had been <br />
added to the small mess of multi-limbed wolves. Maddex, his brother Ryan, and Abdul all <br />
now formally wed to the same four females. Many single female members of the pack were <br />
outraged at the Omega Females &quot;hogging the goods.&quot; &quot;What does Martha think she is a <br />
Queen Bee?&quot; A teenage Chi-Sunny had said. Even Zeta-Alexandra, Jensen's most devoted <br />
and loyal supporter outside of his mates and children had found herself questioning some <br />
of the changes to the pack Creeds the new Alpha Male had made. <br />
<br />
But what was done was done, and could not be undone. Giselle and Gretchen, along with <br />
Laura and Zulema ... in spite of being half-sisters had never treated each other as any <br />
more respect and friendship than they would fellow pups their act and pack mates. <br />
Gretchen growing up in this 'mess' often played at the fantasy her real father had been a <br />
fairy prince and had nothing to do with the Lazuli twins. Giselle meanwhile, seeing the <br />
dynamic of the sub-packs around her felt confused and befuddled about how she SHOULD <br />
feel! As for Laura and Zulema... they wondered if there was nothing -wrong- with them not <br />
being like their mother and Giselle and Gretchen's attitude towards them didn't help in this <br />
matter. All in all, Casandra and Lilly proved to be about the best emotionally adjusted to <br />
living in a VERY untypical untraditional family. And Whitney herself, often wondered at how <br />
she felt cheated whenever Maddex was with Martha and not her... he had married into their <br />
sub-pack for her hadn't he?   But weather through simple attraction or sheer charismatic <br />
will, the Omega males found themselves drawn like bees to honey to the Hindu Goddess <br />
like Martha. <br />
<br />
When Theta-Anne had adopted and brought home two sets of twins that also had gem <br />
stone colored fur into her subpack... Gertchen began to suspect her fantasy might have <br />
been real and had run away from home...  Elise and Fox had brought her back to the pack <br />
sobbing two weeks later. <br />
<br />
Then Martha found herself an Omega of one, when the rest of her sub-pack had <br />
vanished... and Giselle and Gretchen without a father, and Casandra and Lilly  and Laura <br />
Zulema seemingly abandoned. Only to find out they had been turned into empty, puppet <br />
like extensions of the will of Master Jensen's first born. The phrase 'Oops,' had quite cut it <br />
for the eldest twins. <br />
<br />
Anne accepted that Martha was currently looking after her adopted children at the moment <br />
as natural, after all, it was the omega's duty to look after the pups when the parents were <br />
preoccupied.... As Anne worked tirelessly to help her packmates and pride allies not having <br />
time for her four adopted children.  All things considered, Anne's adoption of the two sets <br />
of twins had been considered just plain weird, then again, Anne was considered weird <br />
among her packmates before... not weird like Martha in her appearance or Amethyst in her <br />
attitude, she just seemed to have little distinction between who was part of the pack and <br />
who wasn't... it was as if everyone was a part of the pack to her and worthy of her time and <br />
effort to help and protect...  Jay, Pence, Toni, Paula on the other hand... were just very <br />
happy to have a mother and to be part of a real pack for the first time in their lives. <br />
<br />
Of course, now that reality had healed the inconsistency of the parenthood of the gem <br />
twins, this of course had it's own ripple effect that reality did not think about nor could <br />
think about as it mindlessly and non-sapiently balanced itself out. A sapient force may <br />
have been behind reality's birth, but that did not the creation itself sapient. <br />
<br />
Jenny and Bart had used the PARENTS of Giselle and Gretchen, Casandra and Lilly, and <br />
Laura and Zulema, minus Martha as their personal shadow puppets so they could put their <br />
collage-level law and business knowledge and talent to practical use. <br />
<br />
This was likely the other reason why Martha  had kept her children and those of her mates <br />
and pack mates from waking up and playing with Master Jensen's first born. <br />
<br />
While the adults were relatively quick to accept that the two eldest pups of the pack had <br />
been under the influence of the game (Martha herself among the forgiving surprising just <br />
about everyone, Bart and Jenny the most stunned) the twins however being children, driven <br />
by emotion, and the prospects of loss and have, were not that quick to let bygones be <br />
bygones. Maybe it was a good thing Jensen's five other children were sleeping it off. <br />
<br />
Being outside, none of the twins knew that their parents were no longer will less shadows <br />
until Whitney appeared... And since Casandra and Lilly were listening to glass Marie's tale <br />
of the origin of the curse of Glendale of Transform or Dare it took a bit longer to realize <br />
the omegas were among them again, the pups had been playing their game after all... but <br />
that was when after the dust had settled and everyone finally noticed the wolf with Amy... <br />
<br />
&quot;Whitney?&quot; Amethyst whispered.<br />
<br />
The four armed silver colored she-wolf smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU'RE YOU AGAIN!&quot; Psi-Amethyst leapt through the air in a single bound and began <br />
hugging her packmate her maternal material squashing against her. Giselle, Gretchen, <br />
Laura and Zulema then began hugging her legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes I am...&quot; Omega-Whitney said hugging Psi-Amethyst with her upper arms while <br />
hugging the pups with her lower arms. <br />
<br />
Mary blinked, she knew she had never seen this wolf woman before... but at the same time <br />
she swore that she had... hadn't she? <br />
<br />
Mr. P stopped pinning Chester who fled and came up and began licking his packmate. <br />
Toni, Paula, Jay and Pence soon joined in the hug. This left Mary feeling like the odd girl <br />
out at the family reunion. But she KNEW she had seen this she-wolf before... before this <br />
whole mess started?  At.... someone's last birthday party? <br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Jay asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can thank Amy and Zelipe.&quot; Whitney said, &quot;They restore us all, me, the twins, Abdul, <br />
Ryan, Maddex, all of us...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;THANK YOU AMY!&quot; Giselle, Gretchen, Laura, and Zulema, all cheered, &quot;THANK YOU ZELIPE!&quot;  <br />
The news their father was himself again, (and in Laura and Zulema's case their mother as <br />
well) was overwhelmingly good news. <br />
<br />
Amy acted reserved, Zelipe on the other hand wasn't sure how to handle the sudden <br />
praise. But, he was pretty sure he liked it, liked it a whole lot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are Lilly and Casandra?&quot; Whitney ask concern her daughters.<br />
<br />
The gold pup Giselle spoke first, &quot;They're playing in Wonderland with Eta-Lawrence and Xi-<br />
Betty.&quot;  Of course Whitney instantly knew the gold pup was referring to the mirror universe <br />
Alice and her sisters could enter. <br />
<br />
 The laws of reality of course meant that since Betty was mated to Robert like Wendy, <br />
Jessica, and Rose were, this meant they had been mated before all being turned into <br />
statues... this of course also meant they had been the ones in the gallery who had been <br />
statues the shortest amount of time... maybe this was why Nelson and the others had <br />
chosen to go back to their inanimate existence, while a sense of duty had inspired Gabriel <br />
and the other statue-lions to stay flesh and blood... the Pride's numbers had always been <br />
smaller than those of the Pack. <br />
<br />
Not stopping her hug Whitney asked, &quot;Where are Mistress Alice and Mistress Abbey and <br />
Mistress Samantha?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amethyst answered, &quot;Samantha is sleeping, Alice and Abbey are getting the herd does and <br />
fawns back from Big Bad Island along with the pride quadruplets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney didn't need to ask about that, she remembered everything she had done as Jenny's <br />
shadow and the goings on in the house regarding the game. However that didn't mean she <br />
didn't want to see her own daughters. &quot;When will they be back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amethyst shrugged, &quot;I don't know, but with the pride quadruplets helping it should go <br />
much much faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when the gates opened. And into the estate came seven leomens. The first to <br />
enter was a giant mundane lioness as white as freshly fallen snow (which had many <br />
children ask her if she was Aslan from 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe') with <br />
several names tattoos on her back in swahili.  Riding on her back was a pale beige off <br />
white lioness. Carrying a wheel chair was a male leoman, who walked behind two couples <br />
of a lioness and male leoman. <br />
<br />
Amy instantly bowed. Zelipe stared with his mouth open. Amethyst and Whitney stood in <br />
shock. Chester made a mad dash for the room of his masters and never looked back. The <br />
twins bumped into each other and they took steps back.  The statues were facing the <br />
gateway as they had always had. Mr. P smirked and took a few step foreword. &quot;Hello <br />
Snowwhite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Blackie.&quot;  The giant lioness replied to the giant wolf. <br />
<br />
Mary looked, feeling a headache, her mind was blown into full confusion when the lioness <br />
nearest the giant mundane lioness looked her way and said, &quot;Hello Mary, are your parents <br />
and sisters okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary's head swam, she had never seen this lioness before in her life... but there was a look <br />
of recognition in the eyes of the giant lioness, and most of the other lions, there was Penny <br />
she saw, the lioness who had taken off running to the museum and had to be hospitalized <br />
after a battle with the superior numbered pack so Mary knowing her made sense but... <br />
Mary KNEW she had never met these people save Penny before... yet she REMEMBERED <br />
having seen them all several times... they were all part of the same pride after all... And <br />
Mother Glen... That name rang hard in Mary's head... she her own Matriarch when she saw <br />
her... <br />
<br />
Mary heard herself say, &quot;T-t-there fine, no, they're really hurt.. the pack is taking care of <br />
them, Moja, Mbili, Tatuli, and Nneli aren't here right now, they're helping Alice and Abbey <br />
bring the Gold Deer herd back... oh, but the bucks are already here already...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so.&quot; Mother Glenn said simply. <br />
<br />
Penny could see in Mary's eyes that she was struggling to remember... remember the life <br />
she had now? Or the life she had a week ago? Penny had a feeling it was the latter.  That <br />
was when Penny caught sight of the white and red cub... and she was staring right back at <br />
her! And... was that a wolf with four arms?...  And... WHERE THE HECK DID ALL THESE KIDS <br />
COME FROM-?!  It was like bring your child to work day at the Island of Dr. Moreau. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would care to visit my injured pack mates...&quot; Mother Glenn said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I think Julie doesn't really want-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be just a simple visit, nothing more.&quot; Mother Glenn said a little more forcefully. <br />
<br />
Mary shrank under that gaze. &quot;Y-yes Mother Glenn!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma...&quot; Penny said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Penny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd... like to stay out here with Kirk... there are some things we need to discuss... alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glenn smirked, &quot;Is that so? Well then, by all means, don't let me get between the <br />
two of you. Kirk. Help your future Prime Mate down.&quot;     <br />
<br />
Kirk only nodded and took hold of Penny and gently placed her in her wheel chair.  Of <br />
course the EVER curious twins wanted to know.  &quot;Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay asked his question a bit more precise now, &quot;Why are you in the wheelchair?&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny looked at the positively absolutely innocent face looking up at her... he just wanted <br />
to know... like any child... &quot;I ran into some art thieves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Pence asked, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I went to the museum to save my pack-mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Toni's turn picking it up, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause .... &quot; She meant to say just Kirk but instead, &quot;My pack mates are special to me, they <br />
are my friends and my family, and one whose going to be my Prime Mate... &quot;<br />
<br />
The girls (and boys) again shuddered at the idea of girls and boys together, at the age <br />
where the lines between boys and girls were drawn deep in the sand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Paula asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I love him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny... honestly wondered how to answer that question... she knew all the things she had <br />
loved about Kathy as Penn... a woman who was good on the eyes, willing to take the risks <br />
he took, didn't use him as a crutch, trusted him to come home when working late hours, <br />
didn't ask him to quite his job, though she had been chicken around her grandma like any <br />
girl Penn had dated... but Penn could understand that. ... But why did she as Penny love <br />
about Kirk-?! How many of those traits of their relationship even still applies with their <br />
switch in gender and change in species? <br />
<br />
&quot;... &quot; Penny opened her mouth, nothing came out. Of course Kirk noticed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, please don't bother the cute couple.&quot; Amethyst said skipping over her bosom <br />
bouncing in the air.  &quot;Why don't you target practice on the statues... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jay looked around, &quot;Where's Laura, Zulema, Giselle and Gretchen?&quot; <br />
<br />
Miss Amethyst said, &quot;I think the ran inside the house ahead of Mary to see their parents .... <br />
I think you should get some practice in...&quot; <br />
<br />
Theta-Anne's adopted children looked at each other and nodded. Paula didn't want to play <br />
water-war, but with Saba not present that was not, not an option. <br />
<br />
A minute later Whitney and Amethyst began to wonder if the pups were just bad shots as <br />
they seemed barely able to hit the statues. <br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;I swear it's almost like they're ducking and making faces at us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paula retorted to her adopted brother, &quot;You're imagining things, that's the faces the <br />
fountain heads have always have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay looked at her, &quot;Isn't that the first thing to come out of someone's mouth if they're under <br />
the effects of a perception warp curse?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that a circular argument?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Circular-what-now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Word I learned from Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause she's made of glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause she talks more adult than some of the adults!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I guess that is weird...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jay said nothing and seemed to be hitting the statues just a bit more often... almost as if <br />
they were letting him hit them with his squirt gun. <br />
<br />
Zelipe's shots hit the water basin quite well... Mr. P meanwhile did what he did best, being <br />
he shadowy and ominous dread protector of the next generation. <br />
<br />
Whitney and Amethyst played 'catch up' not that there was much to catch up on with <br />
Whitney remembering her time as a shadow, but it felt relaxing for Amethyst to chit-chat <br />
with another member of the pack who carried the burden of looking after the pups when <br />
their parents found themselves unable to. <br />
<br />
Amy meanwhile her scroll still with her walked over to Kirk and Penny and bowed, <br />
&quot;Konichiwa Penny-San, Kirk-San.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kirk asked, &quot;Do you know her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny asked, &quot;Are you the kid of the wolf who cut me up?&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, this made Kirk want a full description of this wolf so he could proceed to <br />
break the wolf's legs as payment for services rendered. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Amy said simply, &quot;Yamato-San's heritage may be the same as from that of my <br />
previous self Ami, but we are not, nor have we ever been in any timeline, related.&quot; <br />
<br />
Genetic testing, (several in fact) had all proven repeatedly and without a doubt that Amy <br />
was indeed Gamma-Zackery and Delta-June's daughter, and that Lambda-Yomato's <br />
similar fur pattern had more to do with an ancestor of Zackery or June than any infidelity <br />
among pack mates (though the idea itself was nearly incomprehensible to the pack as a <br />
whole of such a thing as disloyalty among mates) and was ultimately just random chance.  <br />
And while Amy was shinto, she didn't have the fixation on honor or as many other aspects <br />
of Japanese heritage as Lambda-Yomato did. After all, wasn't the point of American culture <br />
to assimilate the best traits of other cultures into a singular whole? <br />
<br />
&quot;Penny-San, we have much to discuss.&quot; Amy said.</p>
