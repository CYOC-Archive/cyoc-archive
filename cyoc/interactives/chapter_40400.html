<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Peter looked at you with a great, toothy smile, complete with his set of now longer fangs. You notice this, but now that you knew what he was and what you were to become shortly, it didn't matter one bit to you.</Br>
<Br>"You know, to be honest I am not sure what to tell you. Like I said before, the nanites never allow the person to transform completely for the first time. One thing that I programmed into the nanites was a program to interpret the thought of individuals they inhabit. In this, it knows right away if a man is going to be able to handle being a werewolf. With you, it registered that you might have an issue, but might not, so they continued to allow you to experience the change. Now that you have made up your mind, they know you are welcoming the change and you should change into a full werewolf shortly."</Br>
<Br>"Oh, ok Peter... that makes sense for the most part. You know better than I would. Is there anything I need to do to be prepared for the change?"</Br>
<Br>Peter just shook his head that had changed in appearance already. He had a full thick beard, his ears were pointier and he had the beginnings of muzzle, which made him look pretty cute. "I would say that we could go into a private room, just to our left here for added privacy, but it isn't necessary since we are the only ones in the brewery."</Br>
<Br>You thought for a second, shrugged your shoulders and moved in closer to Peter. Moving in closer, you felt yourself get more excited, but you notice quickly that the pressure you felt from your hardening member was greater than you had ever felt at anytime before this. It was new and definitely exciting to you. Peter, empathetically felt your excitement, which you noticed from his bulge increasing in size pressing against his jean shorts. Peter moved in closer to you, staring deep into your now amber eyes, looking at your face that was much like his as well. He brought your hand up to his face and you notice that they had changed into puffy wolven paws like Peter's, with sharp and black claws as well as the soft pads on the bottom common to wolves and dogs, both animals of the Canis family. You feel his newly, fully muzzled face and smile with your wolven muzzle at this. Feeling more empowered than you ever had, you begin feeling an amount of energy building up under your skin as you watch your thick body hair change to fur and cover every inch of your skin. Suddenly, the energy peaks and your body explodes with more muscle, making you more muscular than you could ever imagine. You smile though, seeing that Peter had changed right along with you, as if the nanites could feel his changing and made your change easier seeing Peter go through the same course of action.</Br>
<Br>Peter chuckled, being deeper than you thought would even come from a wolf. "So, what do you think? Oh, you are going to have a deep voice like me, so don't be shocked!"</Br>
<Br>"I..." you trailed off, being completely shocked by your own deep and booming voice. "... I am shocked, but I am liking it! Peter... I do have one thing to ask you."</Br>
<Br>"Sure brother, go ahead."</Br>
<Br>"With the new changes, I am feeling a little uncomfortable in these clothes. Do you mind if we both get naked?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh yeah! Sure, I was just about to anyway. My tail really hurts right now, not to mention my swollen cock."</Br>
<Br>You just chuckle as you find removing your clothes in the conventional way was next to impossible. Knowing that you had the claws, you swiped away at your jean shorts, releasing both your tail and your now enormous cock.</Br>
<Br>While you stared at your own member, Peter looked on at it salivating. "My, those nanites really did a good job on you. I hope you aren't bigger than me, but if you are it doesn't matter because I am sure I will have fun with you and it all the same."</Br>
<Br>You just chuckled while staring at his own massive member. "Well... it doesn't look like you have any problems in the size department there Pete."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... I know. I have always been blessed in this area, even before I found out that I was a werewolf."</Br>
<Br>Scratching your head with a claw, realizing that you should use more caution in doing this because you might injure your own head with your claw, you give Peter an awkward eye. "What do you mean, when you found out you were a werewolf? Didn't you always know?"</Br>
<Br>"Nope, I found out when I turned twenty-one, some couple hundred years ago. The first change doesn't happen till then for us that are born with the lycanthropy, because we need to be just about done growing for the gene to become active and then go into overdrive, making one look how you and I do now. Obviously, you are synthetic, but you will get the job done regardless of natural or synthetic."</Br>
<Br>"What do you mean by that?"</Br>
<Br>"Two things: One, your reproductive organs are much bigger as you can see... which means that you are very capable of producing huge amounts of seed or cum, just like I can naturally. This is one way of infecting others because your cum is altered on the genetic level by the nanites. Two, you can make other werewolves by biting or scratching any male out there in the world. Whether on Pleasure Island or on in the rest of the world, it doesn't matter. You are just as effective as I am at these same tasks. The only thing that is different between us, is that you needed nanites to alter your genetics to be like me. By now, the nanites that were in your blood are dead because you changed fully."</Br>
<Br>"Oh, well what about the other people who came before me, but didn't change all the way?"</Br>
<Br>"That is a good question. They are much like us, the nanites are dormant in their blood until they die or I flip the override command switch and force everyone who ever drank a full-moonshine to become a full fledged werewolf. They still get all the benefits we do, the muscles, hair, cock size and even the cum production. No nanites can be transferred by sexual secretion though, that is genetic and in them, the gene is not changed to make another man like us. Do you understand?"</Br>
<Br>"Totally Peter, but now what?"</Br></p>
