<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seemed like your Dad and Tim were becoming a bit on edge lately.  The three of you had recently used the magic socks to become each other.  You all had experienced new sensations and perspectives throughout the process.  But that was over a week ago.  <br />
<br />
It had now been an “Incredibly longgg time” as, Tim had put it, since you all had last transformed. He had been begging you nonstop to try the socks but you told him that it just wasn&#39;t the time. After all, your Mom still had no idea that the magic socks even existed and the three of you wanted to keep it that way.  It was a ‘boys’ thing, she’d never understand or approve.  Though that fact still didn’t stop Tim’s incessant begging… <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your Dad had been pretty quiet.  That is until earlier today.  He pulled you asside one-and-one to ask if he could use the socks on an upcoming Friday. <br />
<br />
“Why do you need them?&quot; You asked him, a bit weary of what your dad was planning.  He did go one what was essentially a date in your body afterall. <br />
<br />
Your Dad became quiet for a moment before telling you that it wasn’t just a request on his behalf.  Apparently your Mom was going to visit some family across the country for the 3 weeks or so to kick off the summer. That would be the perfect opportunity for you all to try out the socks again. <br />
<br />
You agreed before realizing that Tim had a soccer game that very same Friday of your mother’s departure.  So your swapping ‘adventures’ wouldn’t start off with the three of you like last time. <br />
You groaned as you realized changing bodies without Tim present would just lead to him whining about it even more down the line. Your dad seemed to pick up on your concern, <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry son.  I can just drop Tim off and practice and come back home.  We’ll get started right away!  You and I use the socks first and your little brother be none the wiser. Hehe.” Your Dad said in a giddy tone.<br />
<br />
“But what about when you pick him up?  We haven’t exactly mastered acting like each other.” You asked thinking back to how you much prep work it would take to do a convincing impersonation. <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, the game ends after about two hours, we&#39;ll just have to change back by then.” He responded.<br />
<br />
You linger for a few moments, but ultimately agree with your father’s plan.<br />
<br />
When Friday rolls around you tell your Mom goodbye as she gets into her car.  You then watch your Dad pull out of the driveway soon after in his own car to go drop off Tim, who had still didn’t know about your plan to use the medallion with dad <br />
<br />
While the two of them were gone you walked upstairs to grabbed the magic sock from the hidden compartment of your dresser. You initially considering just waiting for your father, but you had to admit… you kinda missed the socks as well. <br />
<br />
You took off your clothes and slide into the magic socks. “Now, who do I even turn into?&quot; You ponder aloud.<br />
<br />
You begin to walk in the hallway and notice that Tim left his bedroom door open.  You quickly look around and over your shoulder. <br />
“Wouldn’t hurt to take a peek…” you think as you convince yourself to enter the room.<br />
<br />
As you walk the first thing you see are a pair of Tim’s shoes haphazardly thrown on the ground. You lifted them up and gave a tentative sniff.  <br />
<br />
You groaned. “Damn, am I really going to do this again?”<br />
<br />
After an internal debate, you say “Fuck it” and with a bit of struggling, you manage place stick the top portion of your feet into the shoes.  Soon you found yourself shrinking. You begin to regress, all losing body hair and muscle mass until you had become a prepubescent boy again. <br />
<br />
“Heh, on second thought, I think going to enjoy this a little.” You say, feeling more assured that this time you were in full control of how long you had to remain as Tim.<br />
<br />
You left Tim’s room and went to the bathroom to see your reflection. You caress your body which feels incredibly smooth. Your eyes fall to your tiny penis and you couldn’t help but blush as you remembered what your Dad had done the last time you were in this body. You begin to touch your current balls- if you could call those little things ‘balls’ yet.  The odd sensation returned and you find youself enjoying the feeling. <br />
<br />
“My oh my. What are you doing, son?&quot; A voice says. You open your eyes to see your Dad staring at you caressing your balls in Tim’s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! Shit! It’s not what it looks like! I was just-&quot; you stammer, trying to come up with an explanation, but before you can continue stuttering your Dad simply holds<br />
his hand up and interrupts.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s alright son. After all, when I was Tim I also explored his body, but you might want some help.”  Your dad reached out his palm expectantly. <br />
<br />
You bashfully remove the magic socks and hand them over to your Dad, hoping compliance might save you got further humiliation.  He smiles at you and walks out of room.  <br />
<br />
You stand there, stunned and nude in your little brother’s body. When he returns shortly after, you see that he had become Tim as well! <br />
<br />
“Huh? Dad I totally expected you to- um, weren’t you going become me?&quot; You ask him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I figured you’d want someone with you while you were still exploring.  So I decided I might as well be Tim. The bathroom mirror is ok but I think this will help you get a better look at your current body from even more perspectives.” Your dad copied your movements and winked.<br />
<br />
The two of you decided to relocate to your parents bedroom to do more exploration. <br />
<br />
When you enter, your Dad instantly comes behind you and begins to touch your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; You exclaimed in surprise. You cringe realizing how much like Tim you sound.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry son, I’m only trying to give you some advice&quot; Your Dad said.  He then reached down and touches your little balls and prepubescent.  He then went up and rubs your nipples. <br />
<br />
“See? Just wanted to show you that matter how much you try, no matter how good it feels, you can&#39;t get hard&quot; Your dad says with a sly grin. You hated hearing Tim’s voice acting out with dad’s smug demeanor. <br />
<br />
You blush as you feel your Dad touch your body, that body you both were currently sharing. It was like you were twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I think I can do that by myself.” you tell with some mild annoyance and he backs off. <br />
<br />
“Haha ok ok son. I&#39;ll be right over here tryin some things on my own.” Your Dad says as you watch him enter his bathroom. <br />
<br />
You follow, Justin time to see him begin caressing himself like you had done earlier. &quot;It feels nice, not being so damn heavy anymore haha.” your Dad said rubbing abdomen, clearly referencing his normally beefy belly. <br />
<br />
He turned to face the mirror. “-but I do miss my beard&quot; He said rubbing his cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Dad? Do you want uh, someone else to lend a hand?” you ask him before taking a play out of your father book walking up and rubbing his balls. This time your Dad closes his eyes and moans. &quot;Oh yeah, That feels so damn good!&quot; He says before returning the favor rubbing yours.  It’s a strange sensation akin to edging. <br />
<br />
The two of you caress each other and as the the pleasure your feeling steadily increases your Dad stops. <br />
<br />
“Wait here.  I have an idea...&quot; your Dad runs off leaving you alone. <br />
<br />
“Man, Dad was actually right about some stuff.  Being young again with older knowledge is awesome.” You stare at the mirror realizing you were slowly becoming acquainted with Tim&#39;s reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should change back soon though.”You say before you hear someone reply<br />
&quot;Wait&quot; In an oddly familiar voice…<br />
<br />
You step out of the bathroom to see your regular body standing in the middle of your parents bedroom with an unmistakable boner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!? What are you doing?!” <br />
You ask him beginning to become embarrassed. <br />
<br />
“I thought we could try your body next?” He said. <br />
<br />
“But Dad thats already my body... I won&#39;t experience anything new.&quot; you whine. <br />
<br />
&quot;If my ‘little brother’ keeps that attitude up I might just have to discipline him&quot; he walks over to you and you look up at your now imposing figure. <br />
<br />
“Dad what are you...&quot; but your Dad doesn&#39;t waste and hoists you onto the bed with ease. <br />
<br />
“Lets see how this feels&quot; he says as climbs on top of you and pushes your dicks together. Once again, the stark difference is utterly humiliating but your Dad continues to use your own body for an impromptu brotherly comparison. <br />
<br />
He then lifts you up and places you on his lap with his greater strength. You feel your old teenage cock pressed up against your back. <br />
<br />
“How do your balls feel?&quot; Your dad asks with a bit of laugh as he holds you. <br />
<br />
Your hands waver as you feel up your father’s teenage balls, which seem huge in comparison to your current ones. Your balls had already dropped in your old body. <br />
<br />
“You like that? This is what a maturing man looks like-“ he says gesturing to your body hair. You weren’t an absurdly hairy guy but there was a good amount if hair present throughout your teenage body.<br />
You watched your father brushing your pubes and dick. Before pushing up it against your current tiny dick.<br />
<br />
“Dad ok I surrender.  Just stop, this is way too embarrassing…” You say. <br />
<br />
Your dad just shakes his head, “Nothing wrong with two boys comparing their bodies, it’s just so happens that is a couple years older&quot; he says with a grin as puffs out his chest and lets you go. <br />
<br />
“Dad, why did you even do all that?&quot; You ask him. <br />
<br />
He gives you a look before saying, “I figured if you wanted to stay in that body you might as well realize how much you really compare to an older boy&quot;. You apologize realizing just how weak you were as Tim.<br />
<br />
Perhaps your Dad was right. You couldn&#39;t just become Tim anytime, especially if Tim was in a stronger body. It could probably put you in trouble. <br />
<br />
“Yeah point taken, believe me.  I’m just going to change back to normal now.”<br />
<br />
“Actually son, there&#39;s something else I wanted to tell you.” your Dad says. <br />
“I got a call from school saying you skipped a day in part of your last week of school.” he says glaring at you with your own stern expression. <br />
<br />
“What about that? Tons of people don’t even show up on the last day of school beside summer break.  Plus I only left like a period early.” You explain. <br />
<br />
He smiles and shakes his head.<br />
“No excuses. As punishment, I&#39;m going to leave you in Tim&#39;s body for a bit.  Most likely will just be for the rest of the day but I haven’t decided yet.” <br />
<br />
What?! and begin to speak but your Dad cuts you off. <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let Tim find out about any of our ‘exploration’ in his body, or the fact that YOU were the one who chose to turn into him to begin with.”<br />
<br />
You kick yourself remembering you put yourself into this situation… into THIS body. <br />
“So you might reverse this tomorrow?” You ask you dad, seeking a shred of hope or pity. <br />
<br />
“Like I said, I haven’t decided yet.  Until tomorrow at least, you’re grounded, in that body.”  You’re dad sits back in his bed and smile, obviously taking pleasure in continuously teasing you. No doubt this “punishment” is his way of getting back at you for not using the swapping socks again sooner and also a way to further your recent kinky foreplay.<br />
<br />
You storm out of your parents bedroom in a grumpy manner. You still couldn&#39;t believe it! Your Dad was grounding you from using the magic socks until tomorrow at the earliest.  Even worse, he was forcing you to stay as TIM until then. You enter your room and sigh in disappointment. Looks like you were going to stay as your younger brother for a little longer.<br />
<br />
As you sulk in your now oversized bed, you spot your clothes lying on the floor. <br />
“Man, I used to fit into- these.&quot; You say grabbing your boxers off the floor.  You attempt to put them on but they obviously just slide off of your tiny body. <br />
“Ugh dammit.  Looks like I NEED some of Tim&#39;s clothes for now.” you say aloud.  You return to Tim&#39;s room and grab some of his clothes from his dresser.   Unfortunately most of his clothes were dirty and scatter across the room so  all put on were some of his cartoon briefs and a color block shirt and shorts that functioned as his pajamas. <br />
<br />
You walked out of Tim’s room to see your Dad back in his regular body and dressed. He ruffled your hair. <br />
<br />
“Looks like I’m not the only one who got dressed!  Don&#39;t worry, I put everything back where I found it. Except for the socks of course. I’m not going to give you those back until… MAYBE tomorrow.” He says. <br />
<br />
“Fine! But make sure Tim doesn&#39;t find out any of the details about this!” you say. <br />
Your Dad says he promises he won&#39;t tell Tim everything and leaves to pick him up from soccer. You walk back to your room and close the door before laying down on your much larger bed.  Eyes transfixed on your smaller hands and hairless arms & legs.</p>
