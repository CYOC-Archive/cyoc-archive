<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty searched Lisa&#39;s room, but didn&#39;t find the mouse. Lisa. He sat down to think. Calling her name didn&#39;t work. She apparently was afraid of him due to mental changges that resulted from the transformation. He considered trying to transform her back to human form, but he was worried that if she was hiding in a small place, transforming her back might hurt her. Could he transform her into a tiny human form, like she&#39;d had when she&#39;d been physically inside his cock, and he&#39;d ejaculated her out? He tried, but found that without being able to visualize her location, he couldn&#39;t transform her.<br />
<br />
I need to lure her out of hiding, Ty thought. But how? He thought about catching mice. He could get some cheese or peanut butter as a lure, but he couldn&#39;t use a common spring mousetrap, as that would injure or even kill her. He remembered hearing about live capture mouse traps, that mice could get into, but not back out of, so that the captured mouse could be released outdoors. He conjured up such a trap, made of clear plastic, with some peanut butter, and set it down in the middle of the floor. He watched for a few minutes, but Lisa remained hidden. She&#39;ll get hungry eventually, he thought, but this may take a while.<br />
<br />
He turned the special dial he&#39;d added to her alarm clock, to once again change the passage of time in her bedroom, to make sure that he&#39;d have enough time to find her and transform her back, before they had to get ready for school. Then he turned off the lights. Her mouse instincts might make her more likely to venture out of her hiding place under cover of darkness, he thought. With nothing better to do, he lay down on her bed and waited.<br />
<br />
He must have dozed off, because he was awakened by an unfamiliar noise. He stood, turned on the room lights, and picked up the trap. Sure enough, there was a mouse in it. The mouse had eaten a little of the peanut butter, but was scrabbling at the walls of her tiny prison.<br />
<br />
If he opened the trap, she might escape and hide again, so he set the trap down on the bed, and transformed her into her human form, but even smaller than before, to still fit inside the trap without injury.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, she kept scrabbling at the walls of the cage. &quot;Lisa?&quot; he asked. She did not reply. Oh, no, Ty thought. Have her mental changes become permanent again? Despite Lisa&#39;s &quot;operator&quot; homunculus agreeing to stay at her post despite transformations, and his own being careful to make the transormation wish specifying that mental changes were to be temporary, something had gone terribly wrong, again!<br />
<br />
He opened the trap and pulled tiny Lisa out. She squirmed in his hand, trying to get away from him, but he held her tightly. As he considered whether to restore her to normal size, he felt a sharp pain. She bit his hand, very hard! Hard enough to draw blood! OK, she&#39;s going to have to stay small for now, he realized. Until he got this fixed. At full size, she&#39;d be too much of a danger to herself, and to him.<br />
<br />
He put her back in the trap, and closed it. She continued trying to escape. If her human mind was working, she&#39;d be able to easily see how to get out of the trap. But then, if her human mind was working, she wouldn&#39;t have bitten him.<br />
<br />
I guess I&#39;ll have to enter her mind again, he thought, to see what&#39;s gone wrong this time. He lay down on the bed, and focused on doing that.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the mental landscape he found himself in was absolutely nothing like what he&#39;d seen before. It wasn&#39;t a recognizable control room at all. It was a rodent nest, made from scrap bits of paper, plastic, and less identifiable substances, and it was absolutely filled with mice. The mice were all staring at him, with their hackles up, apparently ready to attack him. While he didn&#39;t normally have any fear of mice, with that many, he was on the verge of panic. There&#39;s nothing I can do here, he thought, and returned to the outside world.<br />
<br />
Unsure what to do, and having difficulty concentrating, he started pacing the room. I&#39;ve really done it this time, he thought. Lisa and I are so screwed. He continued pacing, not coming up with any good ideas, but becoming more and more depressed, and angry with himself. It felt like hours were passing. The clock showed that only a few seconds had passed in the outside world, thanks to the special clock.<br />
<br />
He sat down, and looked at tiny Lisa. She was still trying to escape from the trap, but she had apparently eaten more peanut butter, and gotten it all over herself. He was so worked up with frustration, fear, and anger, that he could not sit still, and resumed pacing. Suddenly, as he happened to be near her dresser, he heard a noise, and looked down to see a small blur shoot across the room and under the bed. Could it be?<br />
<br />
He conjured up a second live capture trap, also loaded with peanut butter, and set it on the floor. He moved the trap that already contained tiny Lisa to her desk. Then turned off the lights, and lay down again, not quite daring to hope.<br />
<br />
Some time later, he heard the sound of a trap again. He got up, turned on the lights, and picked up the second trap. It contained a mouse, struggling to get out. Was it possible? He set the second trap on the desk, next to the first trap that contained a tiny Lisa, now sleeping. He transformed this mouse, too, into a tiny human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot; she said, &quot;Why are you so big? What am I in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty opened the trap, and carefully picked her up. &quot;You&#39;re not going to believe this,&quot; he told her.</p>
