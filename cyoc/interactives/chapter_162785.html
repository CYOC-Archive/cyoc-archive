<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Margery… no, please don’t do anything because your’ angry, and/or to test my telling of what I was told by the Medallion…, oh dear don’t do…” Bob said as he stumbled in through the open barn doors.<br />
<br />
As Bob entered the barn he gave a quick look around, seeing there his wife as she was standing in the rear doorway leading to the corrals and the pasture beyond. He was scared that his wife might try the same foolish ploy that Jared had, she not believing what he had told her.<br />
<br />
“Marg,” Bob called aloud to stop his dear wife.<br />
<br />
Margery stood looking out at Jasper calmly grazing, and drawing the attentions of Tilda and Mildred. She then turned to look at her husband, as with seeing him she smiled. “Wow, you planning to start a new dressing style for farm owners, dear?”<br />
<br />
Bob was huffing his breathing from the rushed run he did to get to the barn before his wife might put the Medallion through its paces. “I saw you had the Medallion in hand when you were walking out to the barn and…” Bob said as then Margery raised her right hand and displayed the Medallion she held in the palm of her hand.<br />
<br />
“I am just giving the thing a test to see if it, or the Medallion… spirit would talk to me, like you said it did talk to you. I wished to want as ask it of some questions!” Margery said, and a moment later she got her wish.<br />
<br />
“Yes my newest Master, or would you rather I address you as Mistress Master?” Margery heard of some voice speaking, but not openly, as the voice was inside her head.<br />
<br />
“You were truthful dear, I can hear the voice, it is communicating…, tell me why you did what you did to my son and changed him to being a horse?” Marg speaking did pose a question, and having heard her addressed as the Medallion’s Master, she felt encouraged to take control of the thing.<br />
<br />
“Really, as I explained to your husband Robert the curse and how it works, did he not explain to you?” The Medallion spirit said as if it were peeved for being asked again to need to explain what it did and of why.<br />
<br />
“Who is your master?” Marg asked, her voice sounded to her husband standing nearby as knowing she was angry. <br />
<br />
“You dear Mistress Master is holding the Medallion and to you I must confide, telling all what you should ask; but of what you asked is to test me and not allow how to best explain as to show what happened to your son!” The Medallion Spirit reiterated of its truer purpose.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Mister Spirit of the Medallion, do show me your purpose,” Margery asked, and Bob standing nearby by was not able to hear the Medallion Spirit talking, and yet he knew what it likely said.<br />
<br />
“My Mistress Master, as like your son you came to the barn not dressed for the weather, especially the temperature. He your son felt the fall chill in the air and not liking to feeling the cold he sought to find something to keep him warm while he tended to his morning chores.<br />
<br />
I do not make suggestions, the curse is very insistent upon that preset criteria. The present holder of the Medallion in the Master, not mattering if the Medallion is as held in a hand or set into a pocket, it is still in contact with the Master.<br />
The curse is deployed only when the Master might don, put on, get dressed, and wear then something worn by another life form. Your son Jared chose to use one of the horse blankets as to keep warm, and as he wrapped it about his shoulders, when he applied the Velcro straps to bind it in place, he was wearing of something worn by another life form; it was then that the curse when deployed, re-fashions the Master’s physical self to become a matching form to the previous wearer.” The Medallion Spirit did explain its use and of what it controlled. <br />
<br />
Bob stood there feeling a distinct chill; he dressed only by his pair of jockey shorts. He knew what had caused the changing of Jared to become a horse. However, and from what little he knew of the Medallion and its control of the curse, he felt safe for the moment while not the Master, as to pickup one of the horse blankets and wrap it over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Margery turned when she saw her husband take hold of small sized, as a gray colored horse blanket and wrapped it over his shoulders to keep somewhat warmer, Bob with his bare feet and legs as still feeling the cold. Marg smiled and seeing a loose Velcro strap she took it in hand and stretched it to where it bound to the coarse matted blanket material.<br />
<br />
“Ah ha, a sharing has come to pass, does my Mistress Master wish to hear what the curse can do for your husband?” The Medallion Spirit asked, and Margery as looking at her chilled husband, naturally said “Yes, please do!”<br />
<br />
That answer as stated invoked then the curse and Bob doubled over forward, he falling to his knees as if feeling a horrible amount of pain. As then Margery turned her full attention to her ailing husband, she slipping the Medallion into her slacks front pocket. She then knelt down on one knee to offer Bob any help she could, as he reeled with pain, neither Bob or Margery had a thought about what the Medallion Spirit stated of it having invoked.<br />
<br />
Bob leaned more forward, he on bare knees and feeling his hands as if on fire he leaned to where his forehead touched the wooden plank floor of his barn. “Ma… Marg, oh the pains, the pains, as parts of me is on fire, and some feels cold, but my groin, my groin, the searing pain is in my balls!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Medallion, are you doing something to my husband…, ow, ow, my skin, my skin it is like I am on fire!” Margery then began to groan as did Bob, but each from a worsening feeling.<br />
<br />
“Double the pleasuring and double the fun, you being the Master did do the binding while touching, and the curse is invoked, gifting to you both, each to gaining of physical attributes similar to Tilda, the last wearer of the gray blanket!<br />
<br />
As your husband shall know a drastic change to his gender and species, while you my Mistress Master gains a portion of his cursed self, your skin shall change of hue to be similar to Tilda and her body hair shall adorn you as it does Tilda!” The Medallion Spirit so announced to Margery, as she let go of Bob, and fell over backwards to her lying flat out of the barn floor.</p>
