<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Street lights flicker on as you finally make it to your apartment. For once, you are eternally grateful that you rent a single bedroom. You dump the bag's contents on your small, cluttered kitchen table and throw your boy clothes in the hamper.
<P>You take the hanger and put it at the end of the row of hung clothes in the closet. You briefly consider changing back now, but decide it's not the right time yet. This body is still too new to leave now, even if you intend to change again tomorrow.
<P>It's strange being in your apartment after having lost nearly a foot in height. The place feels almost foreign, as if you're trespassing in someone else's home.
<P>You pull off your vest, kick off your shoes, and head into the kitchen to make dinner. The cabinets are harder to reach now. You actually have to stand on your tip-toes to get at the highest glasses and bowls. The pots and pans feel heavier when you lift them.
<P>After making a tasty stew, you sit down in front of the tv to enjoy it. Your old armchair feels bigger and more comfy now. Your petite frame doesn't flatten the cushions as much. To avoid sitting on your hair, you toss it gently over the back of the chair.
<P>One unexpected side-effect of becoming a girl is a faint change in tastes. Your usual favorite shows don't seem as appealing to you tonight, although you make an attempt to sit through an episode in the usual weekday evening lineup. Whenever a commercial comes on that's targeted toward women, you find yourself pondering whether or not to use that product. One particular commercial for pads reminds you yet again of the possibility of getting a period in your female state. If you were frequently changing from boy to girl, would it even matter, or would you be on a monthly cycle regardless?
<P>You decide to put the brakes on this train of thought, but then realize you've zoned out and missed several minutes of your show. You've now lost what little interest you had in what you used to find much more enjoyable. You shut the tv off and head to the kitchen to wash out the bowl. You can always catch the re-run later on after turning back into a boy.
<P>With concentration, you'd be able to control those little feminine adjustments to your personality. At least, that's what you were told. You have a feeling it will be easier said than done. At least it isn't having too drastic an effect. You still have your memories and you're still mostly you. To test yourself, you think of a girl you currently have a crush on, and proceed to visualize her naked. You feel a warmth in your privates. It's not quite the feeling you're used to, but at least you know that girls still turn you on.
<P>By now, it's past nine o'clock, and you still haven't worked on your paper today. You sit down at your computer and open a book on the desk. You have to adjust the height of the chair before you can comfortably use the keyboard. Soon, you're typing away, only thinking of your feminine transformation a few times briefly.
<P>Those distractions soon increase in duration, however, until you stop for five whole minutes to think about what you're going to do tomorrow. It will be a Friday, and you only have one class. Plus, it's a lecture. If you sit in the back and keep a low profile, you'll have no problem. You'll be counted absent for the day, but you have a decent record. One day couldn't do any harm.
<P>You finally remember your paper. You stare at the page of text you were researching, then up at the blinking cursor on the screen. With a high-pitched sigh, you save your file and close the books. Your brain just isn't able to focus on the ordinary now that magic has entered your life. You aren't going to be getting any more work done tonight.
<P>Going to school transformed is becoming more appealing with every second. You're enjoying your girlish body too much to give it up yet. The biggest concern, however, is your hairdo. You love the crown braid the hairdresser gave you, and you'd like to wear it again tomorrow. But you don't have the time tomorrow morning to go back to the mall and get it done up again. You have to try and keep your crown together for another day.
<P>If any problems arise, you have a safety net. You can change back at any time, and you also have the luxury of skipping class if absolutely necessary.
<P>Instead of a shower, which would endanger your hair, you decide a bath is more appropriate. There is still the matter of keeping your hair out of the way; not only in the tub, but when you sleep as well. You want to keep all of it as nice as possible.
<P>A quick internet search solves your problems. You find a site with instructions on how to make a simple braid, which would be much easier to manage. The instructions are a little difficult to grasp at first, but you have plenty of hair to practice with. Eventually, you figure out the right way to manipulate your fingers and weave the braid. It takes you quite a while, as you have about four feet of hair to gather, but you eventually finish. Not having any actual hair ties, you go with a rubber band to secure it. It's not the tidiest braid in the world, but as an overnight fix it will do just nicely. An added bonus is knowing that your hair might be extra wavy tomorrow morning after you undo the braid.
<P>You draw a bath and strip down. This is your first time seeing yourself naked since your transformation, and it's still a sight to behold. You don't believe yourself to be overly sexy, but you do feel a kind of non-sexual attraction. If a girl like this were to present herself to you full-frontal, you know you'd get a hard-on, but tonight you aren't even feeling the faintest of feelings coming from within. You're not sure if it's the magic playing with you, the fact that you realize this is your own body, or both. You don't mind at all, though. Sexual activity is not something you have on your "things to do as a girl" list. You've hardly explored your private areas yet, either.
<P>You slip into the bathwater, being careful to keep your braid hung over the side of the tub. Taking a bar of soap, you become more familiar with yourself as you gently clean every square inch of your young, soft skin. Part of you wants to regard the way you rub the soap on your breasts and thighs as sensual, but overall you perceive it as a mere task. Either way, it's still as enjoyable as any other bath.
<P>You brush your teeth and go through your bedtime routine. Glancing in the mirror, you regret having to wash off your makeup. As you splash water on your face, you add shopping for makeup on your mental list to do tomorrow. A second, street-friendly wardrobe would probably be a good idea as well.
<P>Somewhere between braiding your hair and drying yourself off, you've lost all track of time. It's past midnight when you emerge from the bathroom. You put on your panties and a tee-shirt to wear to bed. The shirt used to be a snug fit, but of course it now hangs quite loosely. It rubs against your breasts and nipples strangely, something you think you'll have to get used to unless you want to sleep with a bra. You gently set your braid to one side as you lie down and pull the sheets over you. The day's events play back in your head, and you think of how wonderful it feels to experience life in a different body. The ordinary things aren't so ordinary anymore. Possibilities have been opened to you. The promise of a new day puts a smile on your pretty face as you finally drift off to dreamland, hoping upon hope that what's happened to you today isn't a dream itself.</p>
