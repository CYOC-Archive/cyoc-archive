<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hanna was just about your average thirteen year old girl with a slight difference. She was a she-male though not like the ones causing all the trouble. She had been an adult male in body before. In spirit she was female though she wasn't the only spirit in the body. Due to a mistake in the spiritual paperwork Hanna was placed in a five year old boy instead of being born a girl again like she had been told. She had found herself in that body with the original occupant. For years she had lived as a boy controlling the body. One day the original spirit battled Hanna for control. Neither of them would give and they eventually came to a compromise. Their body would become that of a prepubescent she-male with a special condition. Their body would look completely female and Hanna would be in control. When the original spirit was in control their clit would grow into a penis. After the transformation they were able to find a family to take them in as their daughter.<br />
<br />
Today Hanna was home sick from school. She had a TV in her bedroom and had been watching the breaking news of people being transformed into she-males all around the country. Evidently golden balls of energy would land someplace and then sort of explode turning those within the blast radius into she-males who would then change others into she-males. The media began calling the golden spheres She-male Bombs. The origin of the She-male Bombs deep in the heart of she-male territory.<br />
<br />
When Hanna had first heard about the she-males a year ago she had wanted to go stop it. Her spiritual grandmother had contacted her and had told her not to. She explained that the power of the she-males would eventually become so diluted that it would implode in on itself and transform all the she-males back to their old selves.<br />
<br />
So Hanna had stayed put while the she-males grew in number. Though when she had seen on the news that two she-males who had tried to get past the military lines were killed and they turned out to be three year old brother and sister, she had a hard time staying put. What was happening was sick in her opinion and she desperately wanted to stop it. However she didn't want to risk her spiritual grandmother being mad at her. She didn't want to think about what her punishment would be if she did.<br />
<br />
Now Hanna knew that she had to stop this regardless of the consequences. She got out of bed to get some clothes on. Suddenly her room disappeared and she was standing in a huge room. Sitting on a throne was a larger than life Zeus. She knew that she was on the spiritual plane in her physical body which accounted for the size difference. Sitting on a throne next to him was Hera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Uncle Zeus, Aunt Hera&quot; Hanna said. Her spiritual grandmother had been adopted by Cronus, just like her spiritual grandmother had adopted her spiritual mother. &quot;It's so nice to see you again after such a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to see you too Hanna&quot; Zeus' voice boomed out of his mouth. &quot;I have something I need to ask you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to try to get into my pants are you?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
Zeus looked at Hanna and said &quot;No. What I have to ask of you is far more serious. Salmacis was here a couple days ago asking me to help spread the she-males since their power was growing weak. I refused to help her of course since we don't involve ourselves in mortal affairs as much as we used to. Before she left however she stole the Ring of the Gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did what!?!&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She stole the Ring of the Gods&quot; Hera said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to get it back!&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be a problem&quot; Zeus said. &quot;Salmacis has hidden herself and the ring from us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With that much power at her disposal I'm not surprised&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the other pantheons learn of this they won't be happy&quot; Zeus said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would bet that they're already aware that the ring is being used&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think that too&quot; Hera said. &quot;They would have to be dead in order for them not to feel their power being drawn on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the power of all the pantheons to draw on Salmacis could change the whole Earth into she-males using only a very tiny fraction of the power&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I'm sure that much power will go to her head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I need to ask you to get the ring back and deal with Salmacis once and for all&quot; Zeus said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot; Hanna asked. &quot;Why not my grandmother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body is already that of a she-male&quot; Hera said. &quot;They won't be able to transform you into one of them easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your spiritual heritage also comes into play&quot; Zeus said. &quot;Being half demon will help protect you against the evil Salmacis is spreading.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You also know the counter spell to the sleep spell Salmacis is using&quot; Hera said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's messing with people's free will?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is&quot; Zeus said. &quot;Those people aren't responsible for their actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do what I can but I'm sick right now&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we send you back you will be healthy&quot; Zeus said. &quot;We have been able to track one of the she-males in the city you live in. She is about to pass your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your second sight will be open so you'll be able to tell who she is&quot; Hera said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the she-males don't wear clothes so it won't be hard for me to spot her&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is clothed and she wasn't made into a woman before being made into a she-male&quot; Zeus said. &quot;You will need your second sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a new twist&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed it is&quot; Zeus said. &quot;Now you must go back in order to intercept this she-male before she can transform anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room disappeared and Hanna found herself back in her bedroom. She looked out her window and saw a girl running toward her house. The girl had a blue aura around her with a red halo around her head. This must be the she-male Zeus and Hera had told her about.<br />
<br />
With the girl almost to The house Hanna had no time to get dressed so she raced out of the house in her nightgown. Will she get to the girl before she passes the house?</p>
