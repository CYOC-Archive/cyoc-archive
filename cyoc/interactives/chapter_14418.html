<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As if insults were being piled on top of injuries Lee found himself with a breathing tube inserted down his throat. The men worked quickly to insert the other tubes for those things necessary to life. Lee felt like a space man looking at how he was trussed up and being prepared.<br />
<br />
Watching in quite wonderment of all the action moving about he failed to note the lowering of a hydraulic lift.<br />
<br />
As his binding straps were released the lifting net was placed under him and soon he was floating in the air. The whole thing was becoming like an amusement park ride. Lee watched in silence his own past worries quelled by some of the injections given, his desire now to watch and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Slowly Lee watches as he's lowered into a cannister filled with a lighly tainted yellow liquid. As he enters the liquid it has the consistancy of egg whites making his movements slowed by the thickness.<br />
<br />
Mumbling his wonderings the men pay no attention to his worries as he is now on his way to a new and totally different way of life.<br />
<br />
Down, down, and in went Lee his eyes beginning to sting from the clearish liquid. He grooped about his arms and legs moving very slowly as they are limited in movement by the thick liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee, Lee, we are administering a sedative now and you will sleep through this most important part of the reformation process. When you genius has changed we will remove you from the tank and continue with your preparation for the major testing period. Now be calm and just let things go the way they are programed!&quot; suggested the man as Lee peered through the liquid and gave a simple nod of the head.<br />
<br />
One might sit for a moment and wonder what was going through Lee's mind right then and there. He was now on his way to a strange and different sort of life. He was to become a brute animal and then live as and with other animals of his type and kind. He was to lose his total human form, his mind and memories should remain but life as an animal is filled with instincts and drives urged on by scents and body language of other animals. Lee no doubt was wondering if not plain worried over how he would fare once he was reborn into the world as a bovine.<br />
<br />
Slowly at first and then the lights dimmed as he drifted off into his transforming slumber.<br />
<br />
Now his subconscience took over and dreams of possible life as a bovine went on and on, and on, and on. Time was now without end as Lee slept but not quietly either. He moaned and screamed often as his dreams turned from placid to ones of horrid fear filled terrors. Even the staff took note that his inner will to grasp and hold onto what he was gave him a higher level of missey. <br />
<br />
Some would come and watch, listen and note that unlike those who came before none had lasted this long without giving in to the bestial frame of mind.<br />
<br />
Lee felt a chill and shivering shudders racked his body. He began to chatter his teeth making for him a noise he could not hear inside his tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee, Lee, its time, wake up Lee!&quot; called a dim voice as the chilly feelings seemed to aid and make him awaken.<br />
<br />
Slowly his eyes opened as he saw again the room where his situation all began. A slow moving of his head he was able again to see people moving about. He tried to move but found the straps holding him in place were larger and maybe stronger then before.<br />
<br />
A different man stood by him looking at him as a woman might being in love of her man. He was dabbing Lee's face as if cleaning him and talking on occasion to others who Lee could not yet see.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm impressed with your progress here Lee! Unlike others who came and went through the process your mental state has retained its properties . You know who and soon will be able to understand what your form has become. The fact of this excellent retention has made you a prime subject for our long term testing.&quot; says the man in white.<br />
<br />
Memories for Lee were scrabled some but he rememred his seeing the pretty lady come in holding a contract. The words he spoke about it and the option to be in a longer test for more money was the reason he had endured this mess thus far. Suddenly the statement of the man next to him suggesting Lee be a canidate for long term testing might keep him as this bovine form for ten to twenty years.<br />
<br />
Try after try to groan out his worries came with little success. Lee was doing his best to talk and ask the question of just how long this would all continue when a nurse came over and with a warm wet towel began to wipe Lee's face and head clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy now take it easy your lips, tongue, and head for that matter will not allow speach as what humans can communicate. Your head, skull, and the common parts thereof are changed.&quot; says the lady nurse as she then holds up for Lee a small mirror.<br />
<br />
Everybody stops and stands still when Lee looks into the mirror. His wonders, dreams, and nightmares all came together as he spied the first sighting of his head, a head of a Charolais bull.</p>
