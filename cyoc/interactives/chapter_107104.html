<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Anthropomorphic Hawk. Warning: Side effects include a general increase of size in females. Please read back label for more information...&quot; Chris read to himself quickly, and was turning to the back label when be heard a sharp impact sound followed by rattling.<br />
<br />
With a sense of dread at what he&#39;d done, he runs back from the kitchen into the living room where he left his mother. On the floor, the plastic coffee mug was still rattling. As Chris watches it spin, he notices that there isn&#39;t a spill along with it. He pales at sudden a realization; His mom drank the whole cup, including the entire contents of the vial. As the mug finally stops moving, Chris slowly looks up at her. She&#39;s silently looking at him, arms crossed at her stomach. He sees her blushing, as if somethings tingling that she didn&#39;t expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Son.&quot; Katherine gasps aloud, &quot;What kind of dairy did you use for that cup?&quot; That was all she could really say before she crouched over and clenched her eyes. Chris began drawing closer. She didn&#39;t look like she was in pain, but she was definitely going through intense feelings.<br />
<br />
Just then, her hair began to recede. He stares at her head in wonder. Pretty soon, she was completely bald. He had never seen his mother bald! That didn&#39;t last long however, as tawny, red feathers began sprouting all around her head. They quickly overtake her ears, which seem the melt away under the feathers, before the feathers themselves reorganize into a more streamlined pattern, leaving just enough space for earholes. As the feathers sprout along her face, her clenched eyes and mouth begin to alter as well.  Chris watches silently as his mother&#39;s nose and mouth begin to push outward. At the same time her entire head shape begins to change. Each passing second, her head gets closer to the familiar hawk shape. When her lower lip and nose touch, they extend another inch in front of her face and quickly round out and harden. Her nostrils go to side as her beak finishes forming. Chris notices how it&#39;s black at the tip, but still skin colored at the edge and of her face. Taking a step back,  she looks like a chicken hawk from the neck upward! He&#39;s surprised at the resemblance to  some sort of Egyptian god!<br />
<br />
Just then, Chris&#39;s mom grabs at her new head while still crouching forward. This gives him a real good view of her transforming hands. As she clenched her head, her fingernails started to lengthen and darken. Pretty soon, they were talons fit for hunting. However, her hands remained dexterous, allowing her to firmly remain grabbing her throbbing head. The skin from her hands up to her forearms quickly grew rough and course while also darkening to a shade of yellow from her fair colored skin. Above her forearms, the tawny feathers took over, disappearing into the sleeves of her bathrobe. They were similar to the feathers on her head, if not a little more varied in color. Looking down, Chris realizes that hat her legs had gone through the same transformation! However, they looked substantially more bestial, very similar to a standard hawk. She even had three pronged talons for her feet. He makes a note how she no longer looks like she&#39;s bending over, but now she appears to be stooping like a bird. Her talons are naturally digging into the wooden floor of the living room.<br />
<br />
Up to this point, Chris couldn&#39;t see what was going on underneath his mother&#39;s robe beyond a bunch of feathers around the top of her upper chest. However, notices something odd. Her bathrobe is starting to appear a little small on her. As a matter of fact, it looks about a size too small. Chris gasps as he realizes that it&#39;s her! In the middle of the moment, he had forgotten the vial&#39;s side effects! It wasn&#39;t noticeable at first, but she was clearly growing now, and at an increasing rate. Even though she was still bent over, she clearly looked taller and more muscular. Her body quickly caused the bathrobe to strain. He blushes as he can see her breasts straining against the fabric. Then, all so quickly, her bathrobe tears away, unable to contain a body three times thicker than its recommended size. The tatters hang off her body, revealing to Chris that she hasn&#39;t put on her underwear yet. He blushes harder as her now large breasts hang free. As they&#39;re hanging, cream colored feathers overtake them, while still leaving her areola exposed, much to Chris&#39;s red-face. The feathers don&#39;t stop at her breasts, covering her navel with them. Chris can&#39;t help but look as the feathers overtake her groin and bend over to her rear. They finally end with her rear as they grow and lengthen into red-tail feathers, making the signature tail of a hawk. Not much more changed besides her growing a little larger before stopping.<br />
<br />
Chris, silent, now exhales. His mother now appeared to be an anthro hawk. She definitely had the similar patterns of a chicken hawk. As he began to approach her, Katherine gave a moan as her insides shifted around to produce eggs instead of live-birth. However, that&#39;s not what made him step back again. From her back, two arms shot upwards, about the same length of the two still grabbing her head. They quickly begin lengthening at the finger tips and feathering out. Relatively quickly, she grew a set of wings. They then tucked into themselves, and folder into her back. Chris, cautiously, went to her and put a hand on her feathered shoulder. <br />
<br />
In response to this, she drops her hands to her knees. As she uses them to stand up, he understands how large she is now. At her full, upright size, she towers over him. At 18, he was the tallest in the family of three. But now, she had him beaten by an entire foot. As he takes a step backwards one more time, he can see Katherine still has her eyes closed. Then, she opens them. They dilate, golden and piercing. They focus downward onto Chris. He shrinks even more over her stature and gaze. He is quiet, as while to the transformation was exiting, he&#39;s unsure how she&#39;ll respond to her change into large, walking hawk-person.</p>
