<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barry looked into the green and red orbs of the creature of carnal desire in front of him <br />
that used to be a male human being, &quot;Dana.. please tell me that monster was lying, that <br />
me remembering you being a girl and Ashley being with us for years weren't lies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana didn't hesitate, &quot;They're complete and total lies. I was a male before this morning <br />
and always had been. Ashley never came to this school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she can screw with memories, how do you know she didn't IMPLANT the idea that you <br />
were boy before in YOUR memories, and a demon possessed Ashley and told you the lie of <br />
implanting Ashley not having been part of the school before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana sighed, &quot;You're grasping at straws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I? Wouldn't it be easier to tell one lie, and alter just your memories?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana started at that, it would have been easier, and would have been more simple but, <br />
&quot;Astara doesn't go for the simple solution. Everything I've seen so far screams that she <br />
loves elaborate games... Your answer is too simple, she'd never allow that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Astara indeed did love fun and games. In particular ones that she couldn't possibly lose. <br />
<br />
Mr. Howard had been the school's english teacher. Now he didn't even have the identity of <br />
Mr. Howard, his spirit had been used as raw material to make a shadow dark thing that <br />
was BORN on the opposite side of the moral event horizon. <br />
<br />
The Math, History, and Science teacher Astara looked at rather vexed and detesting. In a <br />
condescending tone she looked at each one turn,  &quot;Science, humans telling themselves <br />
they actually know anything. Math, humans telling themselves they can actually understand <br />
anything. History, humans telling themselves they can learn from their mistakes. Nothing <br />
but little lies you entire species tells itself so it can feel better about itself. ... All... a <br />
mass... of a single, multiple faced... lie... I like lies... when they're used properly of course. <br />
You three are elected as my new pet and guard dog.... You make speak now.&quot; <br />
<br />
The history teacher a Mr. JC spewed a sea of choice words at Astara. The succubus took <br />
them in like a doggy behind a petshop window barking cutely at her. <br />
<br />
The science teacher a Mrs. Tiest, began to rant and rave how this was completely and <br />
utterly impossible! And demanded to know what planet Astara was from and where her <br />
mothership was. <br />
<br />
The math teacher, a Mr. Carlson, a stickler for detail to the very end and proud of this, <br />
said, &quot;Uh, don't you 'pets' and 'guard dogs?' In plural?'&quot; <br />
<br />
Astara looked as impressed as she could be with a human, and made that rattlesnake <br />
giggle again and said, &quot;Nope! I meant exactly what I said! But since you're showing to be <br />
more level headed than your two fellows, you can be middle head!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand in the middle!&quot; Astara ordered forcing Mr. Carlson's motor serves to move his legs <br />
in between the other two teachers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now.. bark boy.&quot; Astara's eyes glow brighter red than before. <br />
<br />
All three teachers barked at once to their alarm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand on one leg boy.&quot; The three teachers did so in sync, or at least their legs did. Their <br />
heads looked down in alarm and dismay. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am NOT a boy!&quot; Mrs. Tiest of course had to say. In a matter of seconds this was rectified. <br />
The science teacher felt her chest suddenly feel so light.. then she felt some THING in <br />
between her legs as her face became more angular and her voice deeper. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are now!&quot; Astara left out that was going to happen anyway. She just like torturing <br />
them. <br />
<br />
Astara for stage drama only clapped her hands, the teachers clothes vanished. &quot;Sit boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The teacher did land down... on all fours. <br />
<br />
&quot;Be silent boy.&quot; Astara said again and the teachers found themselves unable to use their <br />
vocal cords. And again for stage effect, Astara began to ever so slowly draw her hands <br />
together. <br />
<br />
The three teachers eyes were full of panic and fear that Astara drank up like sweet nectar. <br />
Their hair fell out, leaving them bald, but not for long for as black fur covered their entire <br />
bodies puffing out. Then the joints of their arms and legs bent and shifted. Hips no longer <br />
able to stand up right, knees bending the other way, arms and legs evening out on length. <br />
The student body could only watch as hands and feet melted into paws with retractable <br />
claws. Then the real show began as not of their own will the three teachers leaned into <br />
each other, and like globs of water in zero gravity, they merged. Muscle mass increased by <br />
absurd amounts even as their mass fused into each other. The six paws in front touched <br />
each other, like an film super imposing becoming two paws connected to three legs each, <br />
then the six legs fused fused into two. The same thing happened on the opposite end, and <br />
what happened at certain pieces of their autonomy was a tale that thankfully the teachers <br />
would never be able to describe the experience of! As everything but their necks and <br />
heads fused together, a long tail... two in fact, snaked out... in fact, those two tails were <br />
snakes... poisonous too from the sheer look of them!   The three teachers were even more <br />
shocked as they began to see out of the snakes' eyes and taste the air with the snakes' <br />
tongues!  This was taken off their minds as their still human but furry faces pulled into the <br />
faces of a unknown species of canine, like the worst feature of pit-bull, wolf, and <br />
Doberman pincher congealed together. Their ears followed suit as their necks pulled up on <br />
them leaving their perceptions level with the floor... which was getting father away as they <br />
began to GROW, and GROW, they were soon looking down on Ashley even though they <br />
were on all fours! <br />
<br />
&quot;Speak boy.&quot; She said slyly. <br />
<br />
The three heads instantly began to scream, rant, and plead again, in a gruff version of the <br />
teacher's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Silence boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
They found their muzzles shut. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to turn control over your body back to you in a minute, but first, I'm going to fix <br />
you up so you can actually do so without tripping over your own feet... Mr... Math <br />
Teacher... for amusing me I give you the reward of as I said the middle head. As for you <br />
the other two... it's been fun! And about to be more fun!&quot; Astara snapped her fingers. The <br />
six eyes of the teachers blurred into six identical solid red orbs. But what  was really <br />
happening was inside their minds. <br />
<br />
'I can't believe this is happening! So therefore it isn't happening! Therefore I'm dreaming! <br />
Therefore I should be able to wake up! So why am I not waking up? I must be in a coma <br />
someplace!' Mrs. Tiest said her composure completely destroyed. <br />
<br />
Mr. JC's words were not printable in any medium. <br />
<br />
Carlson wondered what was next, at this point accepting he was totally and utterly <br />
doomed. <br />
<br />
Then it hit like a steam roller, as the memories of the two other teachers came flooding <br />
into them. Raised by a single mother, raised by a gung-ho single foster father, raised by <br />
neglective parents. Finding solace in books, going to see StarWars, taking part in the <br />
school play of 1776. Engaged dying in robbery, being dumped, finding true love. Collage <br />
degree. Masters degree. Seeking out all possibilities of truth. Not tipping the pizzaman <br />
last night. Buying burger for homeless rather than giving money to. Wait, wait, wait.... <br />
whose memories were whose now? The three teachers were suddenly very confused about <br />
which one of them started out female, and who knew what originally and who had been <br />
where.... Ashley had said... which one of them was central head? <br />
<br />
The memories meshed into an incomprehensible and conflicting mess. The three heads <br />
howled in mental agony. Then, simplicity came, all the awful awful knowledge went away... <br />
just the simplicity and purity of an animal's truths remained. 'Obey mistress.' 'Obey <br />
mistress.' 'Obey mistress.' 'I am Cerberus.' 'I am Cerberus.' 'I am Cerberus.' 'It is all I am.'  <br />
'It is all I am.'  'It is all I am.' 'All I've been.'  'All I've been.' 'All I've been.'  'All Will be.'  'All <br />
Will be.'  'All Will be.'  'REND.' 'SLAUGHTER.' 'DEVOUR!' <br />
<br />
The cerberus howled again, this time fear inspiring in another way (some of the students <br />
actually wet their pants). Astara came up to the Cerberus and hugged it stroke it, it <br />
wagged its serpents in response who hissed sultry. It had no collar, but it did have a red <br />
DLXIV tattooed on it's rear. <br />
<br />
The Temptress Lover that had once been the Ms. Homes clapped and cheered at the <br />
wonderful horrifying beast literally right out of Hades. The inhuman siren who had been <br />
once a being named Miss Brazil kept her mouth shut and just nodded her transparent blue <br />
head. <br />
<br />
She then looked at the seven remaining teachers letting her malice run wild with them. She <br />
finally noticed the balding skinny man in a gray jump suit who looked at her shaking in <br />
his boot even more so than the others. &quot;... Janitor right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Minotaur principle grunted and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's... someone who cleans?... Someone like that you? Ha! You look rather ill equipped <br />
for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'll have you know I'm damn good at my job missy!!' The Janitor suddenly found his inner <br />
courage at the insult of the one thing he had been able to do without flaw or failing in his <br />
life satisfied in how blissfully unaware the students of staff where at how quickly the <br />
school  would go to gunk without him.  Astara couldn't hear him. But she did like the look <br />
on his face, so determined, it amused her for the moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;... you like your job so much? Well, once this meaningless school is finished being <br />
upgraded along with all the humans here have been made into my slaves and servants and <br />
minions... you get to keep your job!&quot; Astara snapped her fingers. This time her <br />
transformation spell hit with the force of a freight train. The janitor's mind practically <br />
exploded as he felt the carnal pleasure running through him, melting his mind into mush. <br />
'It feels... it feels... all so good... everything... it all feels so good... all of it... just waiting <br />
for... for... ME... only me... just me... and nobody else!' <br />
<br />
The janitor's clothes didn't vanish, he MELTED out of them, his skeleton turning into the <br />
same matter as his flesh, like he had been turned into clay! Then the clay started to <br />
change color... first purple, then pink, then blue, then violet, then orange, then magenta, <br />
then gray, then clear, then rainbow... the clear goo lost all human shape and became a <br />
blob that CONSUMED the janitor's uniform... there was distinct sensual moan from the <br />
mass. Once the uniform was no more, the ever changing colored blob rose up into a <br />
semi-male human form, then shifted into the vague shape of a adult human woman... <br />
then condensed into the shape of a little girl looking to be made of an endless swirl of <br />
living glass. No matter what shape she took, Astara's DLXIV indentation remained on her <br />
back.  The eyes, hair, all of it like she was a jello sculpture.  It giggled... or close to a <br />
giggle, it had no lungs after all. It looked expectantly at Astara who just waved it off. It <br />
nodded and melted INTO the edges of the stones that entire floor of the cafeteria was now <br />
made out of. Growing ever so slightly larger devouring any organic non-demonic matter <br />
she came across within the school's grounds, it'd consume it until it got big enough, then <br />
spit into twins, and on and on. The waves of pleasure as it consumed it adding it to it's <br />
own mass was delicious, she never once noticed when she forgot her own name, or <br />
anything else related to her former existence... <br />
<br />
She actually came out of one cracks below the seats to devour a mouse who had the bad <br />
luck of wandering inside before the doors were closed and brushed against a tan skinned <br />
girl's ankle, the stuff she was made of acidic burning away at layers of skin making the girl <br />
cry out in pain with tears. <br />
<br />
In another time and place the the siren thing might have felt maternal feelings for the <br />
newly creature creature that was somewhat similar to her. But the siren was a creature of <br />
allure and pleasure and slavery... it couldn't know love... not the kind of love that mattered <br />
at least. <br />
<br />
The student body meanwhile, realized to their great shame, though who weren't thinking <br />
about her own hides of course, that they couldn't for the life of them remember what the <br />
janitor's name was. Some blamed this on more of Astara's memory tricks. But others <br />
realized the simple truth, no one there had even once considered him enough of a person <br />
TO remember his name. <br />
<br />
Astara shrugged it off and pointed at the teacher wearing an apron, &quot;YOU! You are a maid?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I.... I'm a culinary teacher...&quot; The woman stammered out, &quot;My name is Velma Ports.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pst, your name means nothing, an animal noise. You should have answered 'yes' to my <br />
maid question, then I really WOULD have turned you into something just as superior and <br />
free of those things you humans call 'mor-all's and 'eth-icks' but you'd have been much <br />
closer to my beauty.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe what you will! It won't matter soon enough. Boy, Minotaur... you and your harem <br />
keep your eyes on the students, any of them run, any of them try to cause trouble like <br />
those last two... kill them.&quot;  The blond girl and islamic boy's still corpses made deathly <br />
reminders. <br />
<br />
Boy, the Minotaur, and the two minotauress formed a wall of muscle, hooves, horns, and <br />
fangs between the students and Astara with her toys. Dana was actually getting rather <br />
bored at this, reconsidering that perhaps she really DID want Astara to toss another of the <br />
teachers to transform into a thing of evil just so she didn't need to watch her 564th <br />
princess have all the fun. <br />
<br />
Miss Ports meanwhile, never knew what hit her. She felt her vagina explode into a <br />
firestorm, and her thin figure ... began to bulge. Her clothes didn't vanish, she simply out <br />
grew them. Like Ms. Jeanne her body got larger, but her height increased only by about a <br />
foot. But she did get larger side to side. Playing on the oldest stereotype in the book, <br />
Astara mutated the cooking teacher, who suddenly felt like her stomach was slowly <br />
becoming emptier and emptier, becoming like a black hole... several layers of fat appeared <br />
on her body along with muscle. Then two extra pairs of breasts grew out from below her <br />
original ones... both growing larger along with the layers of lard. Then her feet become <br />
dull hooves, with the folds of fat actually hiding them somewhat...  Miss Ports felt like she <br />
was walking in high heels! No... her feel WERE high heels! She needed to get something to <br />
eat! Something! Anything! Anything at all! She was starving! She was hungry and... it could <br />
never be enough... this truth hit her with a thunder clan as her hair grew from all sides <br />
becoming wild and messy, no matter how much she devoured, it would never be enough... <br />
BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER! She wanted to eat! Right now! <br />
<br />
Her hands... remained completely unchanged,  except for the dull yellow her nails became, <br />
and the skin becoming the same molted blotchy color all her skin was becoming. A tail <br />
twisted out of her rear... a degu's tail again... The raised platform the teachers were on <br />
turned to stone just in time... or it would have groaned and bent under her new weight. <br />
Her face twisted foreword into a flat nosed nuzzle, then the tusks came out, dull yellow <br />
and pointed upwards. Then Velma's tongue came out... and opened it's own mouth that <br />
was shaped like that of a lamprey. The spot between Velma's legs... also became a mouth <br />
like a lamprey's. Then two smaller mouths with jagged teeth opened up on either side of <br />
her muzzle. A ring formed around her nostril. Her eyes fluctuated for several minutes <br />
between red and sky blue... her entire body shaking... until finally... DLXIV burned onto <br />
one side of her rear and her eyes turned red, looking diseased. 'Have to eat! Have to <br />
something! Must eat! Got to! The hole! Got to fill! Somehow! Yes yes! That way!' <br />
<br />
The gluttony demon charged at the children... the beast that was once Ms Jeanne kicked <br />
her back with her hoof not even turning around, and sent the creature that was once <br />
Velma Ports flying backwards, the layers of fat protecting it from the impact. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stay.&quot; Astara said simply. <br />
<br />
Instantly the pig woman stopped in her tracts, almost frozen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay still.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I must stay still! I EXIST to stay still! It's why I am! I am but to stay still! As the 564th <br />
Princess Commands me to!' The pig woman though in utter insanity as the hunger tore at <br />
her insides. <br />
<br />
&quot;Change of plans.&quot; Astara called out to the students and teachers happily, &quot;Anyone who <br />
causes trouble be feed directly to her... and then you can be made into her piglets from <br />
the inside then eat your way out of her after she eats you...&quot; <br />
<br />
Anything that remained of courage from the majority of students was broken in that <br />
moment. <br />
<br />
Astara made  but a gesture, and the transformed thing that was once Velma Ports took her <br />
place along side the other monsters. <br />
<br />
'Nine down, four to go.' Dana thought calmly... It was incredibly, she was sure she'd have <br />
been dismayed by these changes ... but... after changing Mr. Howard... it was all so <br />
simply... to just watch them be changed one after the other...She was actually feeling <br />
EXCITED at what Astara would change the remaining teachers into. Yes, this was a lovely <br />
game! It wasn't like she had ever been FRIENDS with any of these teachers anyway. What <br />
did she care what her princess did to them? It was no different from breaking the neck of <br />
a chicken you were going to have lunch, it wasn't like you were on a first name basis with <br />
the chicken or were the same species or part of the same civilization, what did she have to <br />
feel sorry for? <br />
<br />
The two naked succubus stood among their fellow creatures of evil and surviving five <br />
teachers... surviving of course not really being the right word anymore than the lambs <br />
being led to the slaughter were surviving just cause there at the back of the line. <br />
<br />
Astara walked  onto the next staff member... the school nurse, a woman in her mid thirties <br />
with black hair done in a pony tail, &quot;You... you're a nurse...&quot; Astara continued to squeeze <br />
information out of the former Principle's mind like a sponge, drawing information out of  <br />
the former secretary when needed, she was learning about this world she had found <br />
herself in more and more and faster and faster, &quot;And  you help people become well again? <br />
Heh. Interesting. The last couple worlds I've been to, 'nurse' was someone who helped <br />
doctors experiment on children and old men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People have advanced since then.&quot; The norse, a woman named Anastasia replied, <br />
sounding almost defiant. The remaining teachers reached they were doomed, but they <br />
weren't going to give this monster any further amusement for cowering in front of her, or <br />
at least Anastasia wasn't. <br />
<br />
Astara frowned ever so slight, then gave her rattlesnake giggle, &quot;All right then, then let's <br />
advance you as far as you can go in being able to make people feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 564th this time made no pretense or artistic flare, she simply released her demonic <br />
essence into the woman like she had all the others and let it work it's magic. She was a <br />
creature of discord, she had to balance out taking a place over and imposing her own <br />
sense of order -somehow- otherwise she'd be betraying herself. If that didn't make any <br />
sense, then that was simply a plus. Some said the Domain of Demons itself was a living <br />
entity, the demons but disconnected pieces of itself it sent out to spread it's nature across <br />
creation, how true or untrue this stood was unknown even to the demons, but the same <br />
fowl essence that made up Astara now flowed through and ate up Anastasia. <br />
<br />
the paralysis was broken and Anastasia leaned backwards onto her back, moaning <br />
sensually. Her skin started to turn a shade of green devoid of scales or hair, it was hard to <br />
describe it truly AS skin. Anastasia belly began to grow, and she felt a slight void within <br />
her, but unlike Velma, this void was not quite a maddening emptiness... It felt like <br />
something, lying in wait, in anticipation. Of course Anastasia's clothes vanished, and the <br />
DLXIV burned into her backside. Her arms grew longer, then split apart, leaving four, <br />
three-clawed arms that either had no joins or was all joints. Her eyes took on the color of <br />
jaded sinking back slightly into her head... her nose caved in and her lips vanished, <br />
vanishing her face a skullish appearance. Her ears wilted off her like flowers in fall. Her <br />
neck increased in length ever so slightly. Like the pig woman her breasts doubled in <br />
number. Her legs became larger, increasing in muscle strength and size... her body by now <br />
held a decided botanic appearance. Her belly continued to grow as she grew until she <br />
looked like she could hold a small human in there... then a red line appeared along her <br />
belly, and split open revealing a toothed maul... her belly's folds becoming transparent... <br />
and hose like tentacles wandered about blindly within. <br />
<br />
She slowly stood up, she looked at Ashley and the first words that came to her mind were <br />
'Princess 564th Astara.' She shook her plant skull like head in confusion... then her pupil <br />
less eyes caught one of the students... instincts taking over, not even giving it much <br />
thought... she plucked the unfortunate lad.. her belly opened up, and with her four arms <br />
she tossed him inside her, and closed up her belly. The belly quickly filled with a pale <br />
greenish liquid... the lad clawed and pounded on his living prison to no avail. The material <br />
dissolved his clothes and everyone was sure would soon dissolve his flesh. But that was <br />
not in the case.. one of the wandering hoses with like a cobra stuck him in the stomach <br />
and stayed there. Anastasia knew much happiness, and above everything else, pleasure. <br />
'Yes, pleasure, pleasure is what everyone seeks out in life, pleasure is the reason why we're <br />
all here, why should we care about anything else besides pleasure? Yes, this pleasure is <br />
good, yes, pleasure is all that matters...' <br />
<br />
Along the cord and into him, these thoughts transmitted into Max, the poor lad's brain, <br />
infecting his mind. He soon stopped, and merely floated... then his body began to change <br />
shape... everyone watched in horrid fascination as Max's body reshaped into a younger <br />
and female form, turning green until she was a plant like thing of chaos and evil that <br />
happened to be shaped like a human girl... hair turned into vines and skin into bark and <br />
eyes into mere holes but her 'muscles' still twitched. Then the belly split open and spilled <br />
out Maxine... she looked up at Anastasia... who didn't even look at her in return. She had <br />
finished transforming Max, transforming Max had granted her pleasure, now that Max's <br />
transformation was complete, he could no longer grant her pleasure,Maxine was <br />
meaningless to her. Maxine meanwhile, began to claw and pound on the outside of the <br />
belly until slapped away by the demon that was once Anastasia. 'That pleasure... that <br />
bliss... being inside her... being one with her... held by her... PLEASE GIVE IT BACK!' Maxine <br />
groaned in loss and yearning to be placed back into the larger plant like thing. But she <br />
never would be.  Maxine felt herself boil with rage, 'How DARE SHE? How dare she not take <br />
me back-!?' Then a very simple and straight foreword 'logic' came to her mind. 'I want <br />
everyone to experience what I have... that pure bless... so they'll suffer utterly and <br />
completely like I am... so they can feel the same pain! The same misery! I want them all <br />
too!!!'  Maxine frantically looked for one of the students to stuff into the larger plant being <br />
so they could join her in her hopeless withdrawal. <br />
<br />
She saw one student, then the blob that resembled a little girl when formed reached <br />
through the cracks in the floor with her arms and grabbed Maxine's ankles... they melted <br />
into green goo and dripping sap. Maxine cursed and howled in anger, not caring her feet <br />
would grow back in no time. Astara gave light hearted praise to the all-devouring, who <br />
bubbled up giggles at being told she had done a good job. <br />
<br />
Astara meanwhile had been staring deeply at the dance teacher... just another woman to <br />
Astara, just another human, just another soul to toy with, torture, but in this case also <br />
upgrade into a superior species to spread chaos, dismay and disorder. The dancing this <br />
woman knew however, was so ... NICE... that it revolted Astara, the dancing she was used <br />
to practicing and observing was nothing of the sort of this teacher who knew everything <br />
from Tap-Dancing to Ballet. She grabbed her with one arm, dripped one drop of her <br />
essence into her, burning away her clothes in a flash fire that left no mark but left her in <br />
agony as her nerves told her she had been on fire, and the DLXIV burned across her face's <br />
left cheek (it was on the right for Miss Homes). She then tossed the still paralyzed woman <br />
like an object to her fellow naked succubus who caught her like a discus almost. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might need a little bit more practice Dana... do to this one as you will, I've <br />
already branded her as part of my reality. Show me.&quot; Astara watched intensely, recording <br />
every act Dana would do next to the dane teacher. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dana...Just do it quickly...&quot; Miss Miyu said seeing anything human in the eyes of the <br />
succubus in front of her who had been a human girl that morning in her memories as far <br />
as she remembered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Miyu...&quot; Dana said simply, &quot;I always hated dancing... I was never any good at it. I <br />
found it usually boring. I saw you dance... and I never found it boring... but I STILL hated <br />
to learn it... and I hated learning it all the more. It was never me. But you insisted on that <br />
'there is a dancer inside everyone somewhere' shtick! I'll admit... you never gunned for me <br />
like ... he did.&quot; Dana shrugged at the living black cloud of Mr. Howard. &quot;Even if you <br />
endlessly badgered me about giving up my pranks, you just treated me as one of your <br />
students... in return, I'll treat you as any other human being...which I am not.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana knew her choice was perhaps shallow, immature, and even more so stereotypical <br />
given Miss Miyu's surname, but it was too good to pass up. Red fur exploded over every <br />
inch of Miyu's body, the red fur gaining black strips like a tiger. No one was surprised <br />
when bloody claws RIPPED their way through Miyu's hands and feet, looking like long <br />
knives that had sliced their way out of her! Her teeth all became canines and her original <br />
canines fangs! Her eyes became like those of a cat, only red within yellow, then a third eye <br />
appeared between them like the points of a triangle. Her face became feline and her eyes <br />
moved to the top of her head. She gained muscle mass but stayed graceful... a blade cut <br />
it's way out of her rear (of course she screamed, or was that roared now?), revealing a <br />
cat's tail to which the curved blade was connected on the end. Then a pair of red and black <br />
leather wings tore out of her shoulder blade bloody style, along with a singular tiny horn <br />
over her left eye. A gold ring formed around her wrist cutting into skin and too tight to <br />
ever be removed, another ring formed around the small horn and a long thin gold chain <br />
connected them. A similar ring formed along her breast (she still had only two) and then <br />
between her legs that also were quickly connected via a similar chain. Finally the process <br />
repeated itself with the tip of one wing and the point of an ear. Then it was over. The <br />
chains dangled long from her body, strangely not restricting her moves moments all that <br />
much. She fell to the stone floor panting, the walls and ceiling of the cafeteria had sine <br />
turned into blackened and red stone. <br />
<br />
Dana grabbed her face and forced it to look into hers, &quot;You are beautiful, you are graceful, <br />
you are tireless, you are lethal, you are beauty, you are death.  You are like fire, you are <br />
pain, you are pleasure, you give and and are both, you are all these things... anything you <br />
were before is but dust... now dance...&quot;<br />
<br />
Obediently, the thing once Miyu slowly rose... and gracefully danced like a ghost across <br />
moonlight. The chains induced pain and pleasure at the same time, and her form gave <br />
pleasure and pain to any who dared wander too close to her. Astara then came up from <br />
behind and grabbed her breasts... Miyu didn't resist, only moan in pleasure as her princess <br />
felt over her body, every inch, pain and pleasure mixing into the same stuff till they were <br />
one and the same. Astara felt every inch of what was once Miss Miyu and then stood back, <br />
the dancer of the abyss only sad that the inspect from her 564th princess was over. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm impressed Dana... very impressed... every trait she had... now either wiped away, or <br />
reborn as part of us... She truly is a thing of the Demon Realm... I command you, kill <br />
Dana.&quot; The tiger without hesitation leapt at Dana roaring her claws forever extended. <br />
Without pause, regret, or afterthought, Dana jabbed her fist into the tiger dancer's throat <br />
then side stepped her and kneed her in the gut.   &quot;I resend the order.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The tiger stopped at once her claws milimeters away from Dana's exposed stomach. Of <br />
course the jab to the throat had left her unable to breath, but this was more an annoyance <br />
than anything, she was a creature that no longer needed to breath, and it would mend <br />
itself quickly enough. Dana's fingers stopped less than an inch away from the tiger's three <br />
eyes. <br />
<br />
Astara clapped, &quot;Your work is flawless my Dana! You are a natural! I was so lucky that it <br />
was you who accidently summoned me to this world and not another.&quot; Astara walked <br />
behind Dana and repeated the same motions she had on the tiger. Dana shuddered, but <br />
not from revulsion, she felt not the least bit violated, ashamed or trespassed, she <br />
accepted Astara's touch for the praise it was. A ring of brown rather than the red and <br />
green formed for a split second in her eyes... a mix of the two... Dana rejected it... she felt <br />
the same as any demon, no desire to be submissive to another any more than needed. <br />
And if giving in totally would grant Astara more power over her, than she had no intended <br />
of doing so! <br />
<br />
&quot;She tried to kill you without any protest, you altered her perfectly. And you defended <br />
yourself without mercy or pity, I'm infinitely more impressed.&quot; She whispered in her ear <br />
sweetly, almost, DEARLY, if the emotion existed in her brain, &quot;If you had tried to reason <br />
with her, or attacked me so you wouldn't have to fight her, then I'd have known you were a <br />
failure as a succubus... but you are not... I see it now... my Dana... you are truly lovely...&quot; <br />
<br />
Deep down, in spite of herself, Dana felt happy at Astara's words, telling her she was <br />
worth something, that she was part of something greater than she was before, that she <br />
approved of her, more than what Dana could say about most of the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dana? DANA!&quot; Dana snapped back to reality as it was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were staring off into space for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thinking of today, that's all.&quot; She said calmly and casually. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying NOT to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable.&quot; All the other students were too listless to even listen in on the <br />
discussion between the cutie succubus and Barry. The crushing apathy of the demon world <br />
was quick to work on unprotected or unexperienced souls, living or dead. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you say you need friends to ... stop Astara from doing what she's doing -wrong?-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.. yes Barry I do... and so you know, we were friends originally, that part of your memories <br />
aren't a lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still remember you, me and Ashley all went to the beach last summer, I still remember <br />
when Ashley stole your bikini top and you had run topless after her... of course we got <br />
back at her when we burned her in the sand then drew all over her face and took a few <br />
snap shots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barry... that never happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My memories say it happened, and weather they're fake or not they're mine. And they <br />
were good times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana did wonder why Astara would give Barry GOOD memories of being with Dana and <br />
Ashley as friends. Dana shook her head, 'It doesn't matter.'   <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't deny what I am now Barry, I can't escape it. Maybe I am becoming just the other <br />
side of the coin to Astara, but I've been thinking, maybe if I just transform those who are <br />
meant to be changed into beings of chaos, then I can hold onto my impulses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barry looked at Dana for several second, clearly thinking, then he spoke calmly, &quot;Dana... <br />
you said creatures of chaos right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dana...&quot; Barry shook his head slowly, sadly, kindly, &quot;There is no 'meant to' in chaos.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana shuddered, Barry always could whip her in a debate.  &quot;The point is Barry... it might <br />
take me decades or centuries, but Astara is just too reckless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reckless? She RUINED all those people! And some of them you did as well!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana took Barry's words without retort, &quot;You're right. I did. But I'm sure you agree she <br />
needs to be stopped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like to me you want to boil the frog slowly rather than just putting it in hot water <br />
where it'll jump out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana didn't like being talked back to, not now, but she felt herself in check. She knelt <br />
down, &quot;Maybe I am. Or maybe it'll be just something that exists, like guns. There's no <br />
putting the genie back in the bottle, Barry... that's the truth of things and you know it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of truth, what about our parents? Shouldn't they have noticed we were all gone <br />
and called the police? Or come the school looking for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana was dumbstruck, SHE hadn't thought about her parents AT ALL since this entire <br />
mess started like, like they didn't matter anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt she'd have gone to the trouble or erasing each and every one of you from your <br />
families' minds. And I doubt she's powerful enough yet to create a barrier around the <br />
entire school. Maybe she's using some of the Thirteen Servants as a welcoming committee, <br />
or she had the principle tell each and every family via phone or e-mail... then again I <br />
heard he was out claim his wife for his harem. I hear she was a beotch, so it's kinda ironic <br />
he'd be wearing the pants for once, heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you laugh at that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not human anymore... this essence works so fast... any human I don't know personally <br />
feels so... detached. And maybe she left a quick fix suggestion via mass communication <br />
from info the teachers gave her that you were all on an overnight field trip, it doesn't need <br />
to last long so it doesn't need to stand up to logic. It just needs to last until tomorrow <br />
when you're all going to be reincarnated as like us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I'm not getting out of here as human am I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;After I told Astara the total human population of the planet and birth rate, she said she <br />
couldn't afford to waste any 'raw material' on 'Petitioners,' human soul slaves or <br />
something. She knows she needs numbers. She won't tolerate me keeping you human <br />
when there are no spiritual defenses on this world anymore from what any of us can tell <br />
and our kind can shape shift ANYWAY so a human spy is meaningless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose I could at least get out of here male?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you wish to be my equal like I'm offering... I did promise Bobby that he'd be the <br />
only Incubus who'd be an equal among the soon to be born Succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You care?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promises... believe it or not... are incredibly binding to ANY being you'd call 'super <br />
natural'... ugh... this information just dumping itself into my brain is getting annoying! I <br />
feel like an exposition robot!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I'm sorry.&quot; Barry said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... so what is your answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was anyone else Dana... I'd say screw you, just so I could be with my fellow victims to <br />
the end, and want nothing to do with your power play... but it is you Dana... and... I pray <br />
you're still a friend to me still in there. And if you are... then I'm your already your friend, <br />
and I want to do what I need to do, to KEEP being your friend.... I accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we have a binding contract.&quot; Dana said stepping right THROUGH the bars, they were <br />
meant to keep out humans after all, these bars had been engineered by Astara for <br />
maximum fun for the creatures of chaos and depravity after all. And the sick surprise of <br />
the bars not protecting you was right up her tastes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please... just do it quick.&quot; Barry said stand up, legs apart, arms behind his back, facing his <br />
destiny with dignity. Dana wondered if this feeling that now ran through her was the same <br />
delight at being impressed that Astara felt towards her. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Dana said hotly. <br />
<br />
She calmly reached her arm, like she, or he were illusions, right into Barry's chest. He then <br />
felt liquid fire enter via his heart, then race into every vein in his body, his burning heart <br />
beat a world trip a minute and burst, only to repair itself a short time later and begin to <br />
beat again. Barry refused to freak out or scream when his male features gave way to <br />
female ones and his biology changed to match. Then her muscle mass increased making <br />
her lean. Her feet became paws and gained retractable claws, her hands remain dainty <br />
though she felt the blades hidden in each finger tips. Then the fur came in, traditional <br />
colored stripped color... unlike Miss Miyu who had become 'bald' his hair turned black with <br />
an orange strip that fell to her shoulders, some of the stands twisted by themselves <br />
making it into a natural pony tail. Her face pushed out into a slight muzzle as her ears <br />
moved to the top of her triangular. She was now able to hear the moans of her fellow <br />
students with crystal clarity, and smell their sweat, urine and blood as if they were right <br />
next to her, and she could smell their fear and dismay, it was like smell roses almost. Then <br />
her clothes burst into flames like flash paper, and it did feel like she was on fire now <br />
inside and out, but only for a short time. She developed a pair of fangs even visible when <br />
her mouth was closed, she felt them and pricked her own, now forked tongue with them. <br />
The stripped tail came out relatively painlessly. Then a pair of tiny horns cut their way out <br />
of her forehead, followed by a pair of wings... that cut their way out of her back like <br />
crimson stained glass, for like stained glass they were, only finitely harder and lighter, <br />
filtering the light around her into various shades of red.  They were actually rather <br />
beautiful if not for the blood stains on them. Berry couldn't take it anymore and fell to her <br />
kneels panting as the blood came down her forehead and back. 'The pain... the fire, and <br />
everything else... was it like this, for all of them, for Dana?' <br />
<br />
She felt one last transformation, perhaps the least painful of all. Her tail tip was.... <br />
blooming? Barry looked behind at her new appendage. It... looked like a natural brush... <br />
the ends of her tail now looked like the plume of a brush... She look curiously at it. Then <br />
color, a paint of SOME sort dripped from the tip... information flowed into her mind, she <br />
could concentrate and will the dye flow to change intensity, color, and increase or <br />
decrease or all together stop the follow. She wondered for a moment where this last <br />
transformation came from but then it all made sense to her.    Barry was an art student <br />
student after all. 'Yes, that makes sense.' <br />
<br />
Barry stood up, the naked tiger like demoness in front of the kaiwaii swim suited succubi. <br />
Barry wondered about asking for clothes, but realized she didn't feel ashamed at all... <br />
maybe she'd need an apron when painting, the rest just didn't seem to matter. She looked <br />
at her fellow captives in their cells, seeing through the darkened chamber with night <br />
vision, or was that dark vision? She saw her friends and fellow club members and study <br />
mates and worried about their fate, but the ones she didn't know, she found it hard to <br />
relate to them anymore.  She looked at Dana again and after a moment or two of thinking <br />
hugged her, their breasts pushing against each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Barry is thankful for this, gift Dana.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana spoke with an air of authority, &quot;Barry isn't a name becoming of you anymore, as your <br />
transformer, I invoke my right to rename you, from now on your name is Bara. Answer me <br />
Bara.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; Bara answered, &quot;So you saw Spirited Away too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bara saw in a mirror her eyes were solid red, not even whites, like they were red rubies in <br />
her eye sockets. This didn't feel shocking or strange at all, in fact, she felt it only made <br />
her look beautiful. &quot;Bara accepts her new name.&quot; Bara say bowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't bow, we're equals remembers? You and I are the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bara looked in the mirror again, &quot;Yes... you're right... we are the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come,&quot; Dana said turning around and walking out of the cell, Bara followed right through <br />
the bars that now allowed her to pass, &quot;You're not longer a prisoner here but a member of <br />
our household. You can have the room that used to be your art class, you can will it into <br />
any living accommodations you want, as 564th's Princess Astara's Majordomo I give it to <br />
you. You are appointed our household's Artisan. There are many walls that are going to be <br />
need painting, you can discuss the finer details of what style the murals with Princess <br />
Asara in the morning. I can likely spare The Twins to assist you if you need any extra <br />
hands. You'll be expected to be there for the reincarnations of the humans though. The <br />
princess wouldn't have it any other way. And you need to put on a good show of loyalty <br />
and devotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dana... &quot; Bara asked her next question logically and simply, &quot;How do you know I won't try <br />
to simply eliminate both you and Ashley? Then take myself and all those already converted <br />
and go to where we all belong now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana looked back at her smiling, &quot;Bara, I'd have been disappointed if that thought -<br />
hadn't- crossed your mind. It's your nature now. And you wouldn't be much of an equal if <br />
you just did everything I told you. And I think it's just our nature now to think of betrayal <br />
as a practical method.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bara cocked her head, &quot;Doesn't that mean Ashley knows we're thinking of betraying her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no doubt. But that's part of the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bara nodded, &quot;There's supposed to be fun here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The essence that's a part of us now practically makes us the enemy of the world to some. <br />
We need to find fun where we can or we're going to go mad beyond a practical point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bara nodded, &quot;I understand.... I just noticed by the way, I don't have Ashley's mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don't have one either... if I don't, then you don't, we're equal remembers? Of course <br />
this means Astara will shoulder you with more responsibility but that just works in our <br />
favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The full moon shined down on the dark warped buildings. <br />
<br />
The two stepped out of the dungeon and out of the gym, Bara taking a look at the <br />
mutations to the building, seeing the twisted structures and goth motifs, but among then <br />
flat walls and flat floors and flat ceilings, and Bara realized she was already thinking of <br />
possibilities. <br />
<br />
Bara smiled. 'Well, I'm painting for royalty, even if it's just Ashley, at least it's not all soul <br />
crushing and heart rendering awful..'</p>
