<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to JT for the chapter</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan Miller was a loser. At 34 years old, he was very morbidly obese, with curly black hair that framed a greasy face with dark brown eyes partially obscured by thick glasses. He wore a Bintendo t-shirt that was a size too small for him, leaving a crescent of flabby belly exposed. <br />
<br />
He was also incredibly poor, having never been able to hold down a job for longer than 6 months his entire life. One day, while checking his e-mails, he found an offer by the Mag Mell for an all-expenses paid vacation to their lovely resort and casino. At first, he’d though ti was junk mail or some kind of phishing expedition.<br />
<br />
But then he got a physical invite, along with plane tickets. And a phone call. Repeated phone calls, hoping for his response. If these people were trying to steal his identity, they were certainly very persistent. He worked up the nerve to call them and…now he was here.<br />
<br />
There was a really cool fountain outside decorated with life-like golden statues. Beyond the fountain lay the double-doors of the casino and they were oddly crowded with malingerers and scalpers. As Dan tried to pass them by , ignoring any comments, a few of them followed him into the casino proper. <br />
<br />
“Hey man,” A particularly wiry Hispanic guy gabbed Dan’s flabby arm. “Give me your chips and I’ll give you $3000.”<br />
<br />
“$3000?” Dan was tempted as he was poor, but he didn’t have any chips. “No, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“What if I wasn’t asking?” The man whispered.<br />
<br />
Dan felt something solid and sharp press against his back.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” A voice boomed from behind Dan.<br />
<br />
There was a yelp and a knife dropped to the floor between Dan’s feet. <br />
<br />
Dan turned and looked up. And up.<br />
<br />
An enormous man loomed over him, grappling a squirming and shrinking man in one huge ham-sized fist. The man’s features were craggy and ruggedly handsome, like a rather handsome boulder with a big red beard, heavily braided and decorated with metal ornamentation. He wore a tailored suit with an open shirt that displayed his hairy chest.<br />
<br />
“You’re lucky I was looking for you, Dan.” The man’s voice was like gravel, if gravel had an Irish accent. “I’m MB Dolan, co-owner of this establishment.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Dan stared, breathlessly as the little man started twisting in MB Dolan’s grasp, fur sprouting, torso elongating, until the giant was gripping a tiny little ermine, no more than a few inches long. “That’s…weird.”<br />
<br />
“Not worse than what he woulda done to you.” MB’s crystal blue eyes examined Dan for a moment, the cold stare piercing him. Then Dolan shrugged and adjusted the band on his ponytail. “And we invested too much in you to have you lose the moment you walked through that door.”<br />
<br />
“Lose?” Dan shook his head, jowls wobbling. “Man, he was trying to rob me. I could always get more chips.”<br />
<br />
“Not those Chips, you couldn’t.” Some kind of butler or servant appeared at MB’s side and gently removed the ermine from his grip. “He’ll make a fine fur coat.”<br />
<br />
“You’re gonna kill him for armed robbery?!” Dan stared.<br />
<br />
“No, it’s just easier to turn an ermine into an ermine-fur coat.” MB snorted and rolled his eyes at Dan’s indignant expression. “He would have enslaved you, turned you into whatever and whoever he wanted. You’re welcome.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, thanks.” Dan shrugged. “Why the red carpet treatment?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, because I think you’re a rather hot twink.” MB Dolan grinned heartily. “Plus, I invited you for a review boyo! If you had given him your chips, that review would be mighty short, all things considered.”<br />
<br />
Dan blushed and rolled his eyes. He was certainly <I>not</I> a twink. There was no point in denying he was basically an incel. But…maybe what Dolan meant was that he’d make a great twink. Magic was clearly real, he’d just watched it happen before his very eyes.<br />
<br />
Dan adjusted his glasses and nodded.<br />
<br />
MB Dolan extended a huge arm and Dan flinched before it ended up slapping him on the back.<br />
<br />
“Ho, ho! I saw those wheels turning in your head!” MB Dolan nodded. “You can be whatever you want, lad. Anything. Except me, not really into twinning, Lord knows I’ve got enough of those.”<br />
<br />
There was a crowd gathering around them, people taking pictures. Butlers came and took away the phones and cameras, pointing at a sign that said ‘no phones or flash photography’.<br />
<br />
“Who are the butlers?”<br />
<br />
“The floor crew?” Dolan raised a brow. “Oh, former Blanks.”<br />
<br />
“Blanks?”<br />
<br />
“When you lose your chips, you turn into a Blank. You’re either owned by the House or the Player that won the chips from you.”<br />
<br />
The crowd hadn’t stopped gathering, and Dan noticed MB was looking a little spooked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, ya know what boyo? Let’s go on a tour and I can tell ya how to make some Chips.” The big man gripped Dan before he could respond and lifted him bodily up the stairs to the other floor, parting the sea of bodies around them easily.<br />
<br />
The first floor was Body. MB was particularly excited about this one. It was his floor, after all. Well, him and his co-owners. As MB explained all the rules and Dan watched as people lost, he slowly began to realize how dangerous this casino truly was. He’d almost become a Blank-he could look over the railing to the ground floor and see someone transform into one at any given moment. It was <b>easy</b> to lose.<br />
<br />
As he viewed the floor,there was whimsy and amusement, but also dismay. Wrestlers pressed against each other in a ring, Sumos slammed together, kick-boxers fought in a deadly tournament with rules of its own. He sighed and stared down at his flabby boobs and voluminous gut. He was fat, weak, and had asthma. Dan knew he could never win any of these fights, even the Sumo wrestling one.<br />
<br />
“So, this is Body?” Dan said, eyeing a horse race. VR.<br />
<br />
“Don’t. Unless you wanna be a horse.” MB warned. “Sure you don’t wanna try Sumo? I could make -you could do well there.”<br />
<br />
Dan shook his head. “There’s technique to it, you know.”<br />
<br />
“I do.” MB studied him, noting his dismay. “Next floor?”<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and they took the escalator this time to the Floor of Mind.<br />
<br />
There were very few games outside of the two major competitions on this floor. One was maze running-which appeared to take a level of cunning and wit to beat that Dan wished he had. The other was a sort of tactical war game that could adjust to different eras. Dan was not a tactician. He was also a poor loser in general, so not very into the competitive miniatures games. What was left was high-speed chess and…well, nothing his nerd knowledge could give him an upper hand in.<br />
<br />
“Not interested, huh?” MB took a breath, “Let’s try Soul, then?”<br />
<br />
Dan nodded, but his heart was already sinking as the took the escalator. He had a feeling things weren’t going to get better for him here. He was just a loser, after all.<br />
<br />
His fear were realized as his took in the Floor of Soul.<br />
<br />
Painting contests, cooking contests? He’d watched Kitchen Frightmares like everyone else, but he knew he couldn’t do better than even the shitty cooks on that show. And god, painting took skill and technique…nope.<br />
<br />
“Is that tiger looking at me?” Dan pointed a painting of a tiger on the wall.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” MB said. “Anything besides the painting catching your eye? I mean, unless you want to buy him. $5000.”<br />
<br />
“I wish I was him.” Dan whispered, eyeing the lithe, heavily muscled tiger in the painting.<br />
<br />
“Noted.” MB Dolan smirked. “So, and I repeat, anything else on this floor catching your eye?”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Dan jerked his attention form the painting.<br />
<br />
There were magic shows. Bunches of theme. Magician face-offs. Some of the shows allowed real magic while others were mundane sleight-of-hand and chicanery only. There was a space that offered hybridized tournaments. He could bet on them or participate.<br />
<br />
Dan heart dropped. He didn’t know anything about magic either. If he bet wrong, he’d end up…well, anything, really. A rabbit or a dove or something. It didn’t matter.<br />
<br />
He took a seat on a nearby bench and took out his 3 Chips. He could buy more…if he had any money. He buried his head in his hands, running his fingers through his curly hair. There was nothing. He was screwed, he’s taken a plane out here for nothing! Dan wanted to scream or cry, but instead he just sort of wallowed in his misery.<br />
<br />
The bench shifted and creaked dangerously as MB Dolan sat down next to him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be mad, boyo. At least you know your limits. Most people don’t notice.” Dolan pat Dan on the back.<br />
<br />
“So what?” Dan snapped, surprising himself at his own ferocity, “What’s the point of coming if I can’t beat them and lose everything!”<br />
<br />
“You know…” Dolan stroked his beard. “Their <I>are</I> other ways to earn chips. Usually by being an escort or by doing odd jobs for the other guests.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? And who would want me a 30 year old gamer with this body” Dan spat.<br />
<br />
MB looked around and pointed at Dan before whispering something that was lost in the murmur of the casino.<br />
<br />
Dan shivered, tasting copper in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be too hard on yourself! You don’t look a day over 21 and sure, you’re kinda twinkish, but that just makes you the best person for the job.” MB Dolan smiled. “He’s looking for an assistant and I think you’ll be a great fit.”<br />
<br />
Dan sighed, his fat receding, leaving behind only a small belly. He raked his fingers through his hair, which slowly uncurled, the scattering of grays disappearing as he grew younger, the hair becoming slicked back, longer. He blinked, his glasses disappearing with a *pop*, eyes changing from dull brown to a vibrant green. <br />
<br />
“Alright, fine, show me the way. Not like a have much of a choice, do I?” Dan smiled, teeth straightening, whitening, complexion clearing. He stood, wobbling, as he experienced a feeling of vertigo, becoming shorter, twinkier.<br />
<br />
“That’s the spirit lad!” MB bellowed, smacking Dan on the back. “The best path to success is to look the part and trust me, you do. Follow me.”<br />
<br />
Dan followed the muscled hulk as they made their way through the Floor of Soul. He saw more alluring painting, statues in erotic poses, frozen in a state of pure bliss. Dan shivered, creeped out by the statues, huddling closer to MB Dolan. They past the main floor, going further back. Dan wondered just how vast this casino really was. He passed by many doors with flashy names like “Chad the Illusionist” and “Mordom Orcsy” famed orc chef from the hit cooking show “Devil’s Kitchen”. All incredibly talented individuals who appeared to have their own rooms here. They walked past an announcement board that had all the shows scheduled for the day.<br />
<br />
There were two sold out magic shows on the board. One starring a handsome kitsune called “Akita: Master of Magic!”. He had a 90% win rate. Next to him, and closest to his record, was a Chinese Dragon with a show called “Deng-Long, The Dazzler!” with a 70% win rate. The rest of the shows had win-rates of 40% of less.<br />
<br />
“Wow, those two are crushing it.” Dan said. “Are the others that bad?”<br />
<br />
“No. 40% is the average, actually.” MB shrugged. “When those two titans clash, it’s always sold out.”<br />
<br />
They walked through the auditorium past the main stage towards a door in the back. Dan found himself in a hallway filled with multiple rooms. Each one with a golden star and a double door with each door bearing a star.<br />
<br />
“This area is where the winners prepare and sleep until the next competition.” MB explained. “Each room is tailored to the occupants. If they have a star and are close to the main stage, you’re considered a top contender. The bigger a draw for audiences you are, the better your room and accommodations.”<br />
<br />
“I thought it was a competition?”<br />
<br />
“It is, but this is a <I>performance</i> category. It’s not just about the magic, it’s about being entertaining as well.”<br />
<br />
One of the doors opened and Dan briefly caught a glimpse of DJ ‘S’mores’ holding a dance party in his room to the enjoyment of a small crowd. The room was perfect for it and luxuriously appointed. Then the door closed.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap!” Dan stared. “It’s way bigger on the inside! And those accommodations were top notch! No wonder they stay here.”<br />
<br />
“Yup. Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, but as long as they challenge themselves we give them what they want. As long as they can pay.” MB walked past the VIP rooms.<br />
<br />
Dan grew more and more concerned as they left the VIP halls. They were going farther and farther from the main stage. Eventually, the turned down a dark, barely lit hallway. A few Blanks sprawled along the floor, empty whiskey bottles and needles next to their white, formless shapes. Chips were scattered on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I guess we need to send someone to clean these up.” MB scowled. “Want one?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Dan stared at the Blanks. “No…thanks though.”<br />
<br />
“Here we are.” MB grinned, stopping in front of a closet door with a star sign on it that looked like poorly painted cardboard. The door was old, scuffed, and the knob was loose. “He’s really going to be glad to see someone like you!”<br />
<br />
“Please tell me this is a joke.” Dan said, eyeing the door.<br />
<br />
“Nope! Let’s see if he’s in there.” MB knocked on the door, each knock making the door creak. “Yuyaku, it’s me, Dolan. I got a new assistant for you!”<br />
<br />
Dan heard movement behind the door. Maybe this was a newbie with a hidden talent-that would explain why Dolan recommended him. The door creaked slowly open and a fox with gray-white fur and thick glasses on his face peered out at them. The tiny fox was smaller than Dan was, wearing suspenders, holding a pair of cards. His hand shook and dropped the cards to the floor. The fox gave them both an apologetic look and scrambled to pick them up.<br />
<br />
“This is the guy that needs your help.” MB said. “He’s a magician that’s going to perform in the next show.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Dan hissed to MB. “I’m new, I don’t know what I’m doing! It’s gonna be the blind leading the blind here!”<br />
<br />
The fox raised a brow. “I may be new but I have a lot of spirit.”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Dan said, then whispered to Dolan. “He sounds like a little league coach with a losing team!”<br />
<br />
“If you’d like to leave,” The fox’s voice went flat. “You can. But I doubt you came here to talk shit about me.”<br />
<br />
MB smiled and nodded encouraging<br />
<br />
Dan sighed. “I’m sorry. I’m just trying to find someone who needs an assistant.”<br />
<br />
“You look right. Someone new and fresh, and based on your clothes, you’re here to make yourself known.” The fox circled Dan, appraising him. “I’ll take you on if you’d like.”<br />
<br />
“I look the part but that’s about it.” Dan adjusted his suit and brushed his hair behind his ear. “But before I accept, I have to ask what my payment is going to be. Can you afford an assistant?”<br />
<br />
<br />
The fox snorts. “The payment depends on if we win or not. If we do, I pay you well. If not, at least you get something out of it.”<br />
<br />
Dan considered the fox. He seemed like a starting magic user-and an old one, at that. But he understood what the fox was offering. As long as he played the fox’s assistant, he’d get paid or learned the trade if the fox lost.<br />
<br />
“So, you in or out?” The fox swung his door open, revealing the room behind him, and stepped to one side. “Make your choice, Dan.”<br />
<br />
Dan frowned, not sure if he’d actually told the fox his name, then his frowned deepened when he saw the room. The fox’s room was dark, lit by lanterns, and cramped-looking. The decor was terrible and it smelt like a bar.<br />
<br />
Dan hesitated and shot a questioning look at MB. The huge man winked and nodded, gesturing for Dan to enter. <br />
<br />
He sighed and walked through the threshold.<br />
<br />
A blinding light flashed, forcing him to blink and stumble. The horrible barnyard smell went away and by the time his sight had recovered, he had to rub his eyes just to make sure he wasn’t dreaming.<br />
<br />
He stood in a vast room with a vaulted ceiling made of colored glass. Sweeping grand staircases stood on either side of the Ball Room Dan found himself standing in. The floor in the middle of the room appeared to be made of glass, offering views of the casino floor below. As he watched, the view switched to a different area of the casino.<br />
<br />
A heavily muscled anthro horse and anthro tiger descended either side of the staircase, fur glistening in the light, perfectly groomed to highlight their muscles.<br />
<br />
That’s about the time Dan noticed the furniture-well decorated, ornate, and the sofas looked soft and plump. As Dan wandered in, taking in all the paintings and statues, he heard the door close behind him. He turned and stared at the fox.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what the fuck is this?” Dan demanded. “Who are you really?”<br />
<br />
“It’s best if I just show you.” The fox snickers.<br />
<br />
As he stare at the fox he look toward his changes as his silver gray fur start to to change into a vibrant orange color as the old fox become younger by the second as his old look become a devilish handsome as the wrinkles disappear from his face. His height increase till he stand a head over him as his suspenders that he was wearing molded to a nice tuxedo. He give a grin as his tail split into tho and then both tail split and till they were 8 tail moving behind him. He lanky form become more athletic. As his stance become more confident. Yuyaku he give a grin that made Dan blush heavily. He stand in front of him as Akita the great.<br />
<br />
“You’re… you’re…” Dan stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Yep! Akita the great or, to personal friends and lovers, Yuyaku” The kitsune smirked.<br />
<br />
“Why the disguise? Why place your room in the back?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“It was a test to see if you were okay working as an assistant to a nobody. You barely passed, by the by.” Yuyaku snapped his fingers and a table appeared in the middle of the room, complete with a tea set and two cups. He sat in one chair and gestured for Dan to sit in the other. Dan did. Yuyaku poured them both some tea. “Also, when you’re as successful as I am, you have to deal with sabotage. My competitors can’t send their spies here without revealing themselves.”<br />
<br />
Dan nodded, more interested in the two servant again. <br />
<br />
The massive anthro horse offered sugar cubes to them both. He was wearing nothing but a thong, a small tie, and cuff-links. The horse’s massive muscles flexed under his dark brown hide with even the simplest movements. As he dropped a few cubes in Dan’s tea, Dan caught a whiff of warm hay and sex. Yuyaku stroked the bulge in his thong when the horse finished his task, the horse whickering softly.<br />
<br />
The tiger, on the other hand, was thicker and bulkier than the horse with a slight gut. A power lifter build with a serious muscle-gut. The tiger’s eyes were sharp, definitely not the dull, happy brown of the horse, watching every movement Dan made. Perhaps not just an assistant, then, but a bodyguard? He had no weapons Dan could see, just a pair of tight booty shorts that glittered in the light and left nothing to the imagination.<br />
<br />
“You already have two assistants why you need another?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“Two?” Yuyaku followed Dan’s gaze to the horse and chuckled. “You mean Scoot? Oh, no, he’s not an assistant! He’s what is known as a stage hand. Doesn’t have the Mind or Soul to function as anything else unless I invest in him.” Yuyaku scratched Scoot’s chin, the horse anthro closing his eyes in enjoyment. “Besides, I need someone new, someone who won’t bid the minute they get chips like a caveman and force me to find a new assistant to invest in after the lose.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but why me? You’re famous! Your show sold out the moment it was announced. You could choose anyone in the casino.” Dan took a sip of the fragrant tea, feeling suddenly refreshed. He didn’t notice his black hair lightening or his ears coming to points.<br />
<br />
“Not everyone. MB Dolan brought you to me for a reason: you know your weaknesses. Hopefully you don’t end up like my last assistant.” Yuyaku spat.<br />
<br />
“May I ask…?”<br />
<br />
“He was fine, at first. We worked together for a few shows. I was undefeated, top of my game. Then one day, my assistant decided to bet everything. One of my rivals had given him a fake tip. He lost everything, including his Mind Chip.”<br />
<br />
”So?”<br />
<br />
“Do you know how Mind Chips work? You earn one and you get all the previous owner’s memories. He knew all my old tricks. One of my rivals got a hold of the Chip, put it into circulation, and suddenly I lost several rounds in a row.” Yuyaku’s grip on his tea cup tightened, then eased. “But, that’s all in the past now. Let’s talk about your new position.”<br />
<br />
Dan nodded.<br />
<br />
“You will work with me on stage any time I face someone. You cannot speak about any tricks you and Ivan here. Most importantly, never bid everything.” Yuyaku ticked off his rules. “Got it?”<br />
<br />
Dan nodded.<br />
<br />
Yuyaku slid a few Chips over to Dan. “This is something to get you started.”<br />
<br />
Dan stared. <br />
<br />
One Mind Chip, one Soul Chip. He picked them and flinched as they disappeared as soon his fingers touched them. Memories assaulted him, of doing tricks and practicing with Ivan and Yuyaku. His body was different in these memories, more agile…more furry?<br />
<br />
Dan fell back in his chair as the knowledge settled into him, not noticing as his fingernails sharpened and grew into claws.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what was that? Where did these memories come from?” Dan whimpered, dazed.<br />
<br />
“Aw, look boys, popped his Chip cherry!” Yuyaku and Ivan shared a grin, while scoot just stared at Dan dumbly. “You still have those chips but the way it works is that as long as you have them, you automatically use them. Be careful what Mind and Soul chips you pick up. Body Chips are a bit different-you choose what chip you’d like to use. Just don’t be stupid and bet those new chips, that’s your training. Things get substantially harder if you don’t have that.”<br />
<br />
“And what’s stopping me from betting these chips?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“Okay, let me make this clearer for you: If you do lose those chips I’m done with you.”<br />
<br />
“Then what about my chips? I could bet them.” <br />
<br />
“You only have one Body chip. Lose that and, well…then you’ll just be a Blank.”<br />
<br />
“Why not give me a Body Chip as well? Clearly I need a better body to pull of some of those tricks, if my memories are anything to go by.” Dan said, not noticing a light layer of hair growing over his toned body.<br />
<br />
“Then what you run off? No I trust you enough but not enough to give you a whole set to gamble? Beside you body is what we need for the trick and if you lose well I hope you like being one of the Las Vegas show animals.” He Sup his tea nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
“And you’ll run off. I trust you Dan, but not enough to give you a whole set to gamble with. Besides, your body is what we need for the new tricks I’m working on.“  The kitsune demurely sipped his tea, eyeing the changes to Dan’s body with satisfaction. “And if you fuck up…I hope you enjoy being a Vegas show animal.”<br />
<br />
“And how long do I have to wait till I get more chips?” Dan huffed, scratching the stubble on his chin.<br />
<br />
“With just a few dozen show in hand you can bet to your heart’s content without worry” Yuyaku said, leaning forward and stroking Dan’s chin, rubbing and scritching his beard. Dan involuntarily purred and leaned into the paw. Yuyaku smiled and continued speaking. “Here’s a pair of keys to your new room. I bought you an upgrade from that free shit MB gave you. Tomorrow, once you’ve, uh, shall we say, <I>settled in</I>, we shall start your training.”<br />
<br />
Dan closed his eyes, purring louder. He could only nod, enjoying the scratching. Yuyaku leaned in and kissed him, tongue exploring Dan’s mouth. The kitsune was so hot and Dan had been pent up for so long…<br />
<br />
“Whoa, wait!” Dan’s eyes went wide and he broke the kiss, tasting a lingering sweetness in his mouth, like the kitsune had been sucking on a hard candy before frenching him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Danny boi…” Yuyaku licked his lips. “You never asked what my former assistant’s orientation was. You have his Mind and Soul now.”<br />
<br />
“Yuyaku, I…” Danny hesitated and the kitsune leaned in and kissed the confused young man again.<br />
<br />
Another snap, and the table transformed into a bed. Yuyaku drew Dan onto it. A cool breeze ruffled Dan’s growing fur coat. Looking down, Dan realized he’d somehow lost all his clothes, leaving his muscular body exposed. Tight abs, white hairs all over his body…his dick looked longer, thicker, pink and stiff. His balls were pent up and churning. <br />
<br />
“Let me show you all the extra perks you get when working with me.” The kitsune crossed his lovely furry legs and trailed a dainty paw along his thigh.<br />
<br />
Dan started to back away when he bumped into a solid wall of muscle and fat. He turned and saw the tiger behind him, grinning and naked. Ivan licked one clawed digit and rubbed it against Dan’s asshole. Dan gasped, not noticing his ass swell and bulge with muscle.<br />
<br />
He found himself falling onto the bed, ending up on all fours, the kitsune beneath him and the tiger behind him, rubbing his prostate with one padded finger. Yuyaku started licking Dan’s cock and rolling his balls in one softly padded hand.<br />
<br />
Ivan removed his digit and pressed his throbbing feline erection against Dan’s tight hole.<br />
<br />
“I’m a virgin!” Dan blurted.<br />
<br />
“For your next trick, you’re going to make Ivan’s cock disappear.” The Kitsune snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
Dan moaned as his anal ring tensed and relaxed, loosening like he’d taken Ivan a million times. The tip of Ivan’s cock slowly entered him. Dan moaned, flexing his hole, and the tiger eagerly thrust forward, bumping something inside Dan that had his own cock dripping pre like a faucet.<br />
<br />
The kitsune resumed suckling Dan’s cock, nibbling lightly on his foreskin, which had slowly regrown. The tiger behind him began to thrust sharply, balls smacking against Dan’s voluptuous ass-cheeks. Dan groaned, tried to close his legs, the sensations too much, overwhelming him, but the tiger had firmly spread his lags apart.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck…” Dan’s eyes rolled in his head. “I…”<br />
<br />
Two big hooflets gripped Dan’s head and he smelt a whiff of barnyard. The transforming man looked up to see Scoot’s fat black horse-cock inches away from his nose. The horse grinned dumbly and prodded Dan’s mouth.<br />
<br />
There was a snap of fingers below him and Dan found himself opening his mouth, taking the horse’s huge flat head into it, sucking and rolling his tongue around the edge. The horse whinnied happily and thrust his cock straight down Dan’s throat.<br />
<br />
Dan wanted to scream-he was choking, tears were rolling down his face, he couldn’t breath! <br />
<br />
Then he heard another snap and suddenly he could breath from his nose, inhaling the horse’s musky stench, throat undulating oddly, strange muscles moving and gripping and teasing the thick shaft in his mouth. His mouth felt odd-strangely sensitive, and enjoyed the fullness having a big cock stretching it brought.<br />
<br />
His asshole had undergone the same strange transformation his mouth had, muscles squeezing and undulating around the tiger’s fat cock. Dan shivered, being spit-roasted like this made him feel profoundly sex and fulfilled. Unnoticed, Dan’s spine began to extend, becoming a short tail that twitched in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Settling nicely, aren’t you Danny?” Yuyaku asked, licking Dan’s cock.<br />
<br />
Dan said nothing, couldn’t say anything, the horse’s balls were smacking his chin. The strange peristalsis in his throat and anus sped up in time with his lover’s thrusts, becoming more intense. Dan knew they weren’t going to last long, though he had no idea how he knew that, only that he was made to suck out their cum.<br />
<br />
The thought was odd and yet, gave Dan a feeling of contentment. The horse and the tiger both began to climax at the same time, roaring and whinnying, stamping a hoof. Cum spurted down Dan’s throat, deep into his asshole.<br />
<br />
Dan took it all, all his body’s muscles tingling with warmth as they began to bloat and flex. The former twink firmly graduated to twunk as the last of the spunk entered him and the horse and tiger pulled out. Moaning, Danny felt his own orgasm surge towards release.<br />
<br />
“I’m…” Danny panted.<br />
<br />
“Go on tiger. Let it out.” The kitsune smiled and thrust his muzzle firmly onto the transforming man’s groin.<br />
<br />
Danny snarled and let his orgasm wash over him, cock spurting load after load of semen in Yuyaku’s hungry mouth. The fox eagerly swallowed the load. Danny sighed and tried to pull away.<br />
<br />
The kitsune held on, sucking on Danny groin harder, faster.<br />
<br />
“Gah! Wha-what is he-?!” Danny tried to pull away but Ivan and Scoot held him in place.<br />
<br />
“Just let go.” Scoot said.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need it anymore.” Ivan purred.<br />
<br />
“N-need? Need what-oh!” Dan’s eyes rolled into the back of his head.<br />
<br />
He could feel them-his memories-breaking loose, drawn to the kitsune. His memories of being mocked, of being fat, useless, a loser. <I>That’s</I> what the fox wanted?<br />
<br />
Dan relaxed and let the memories break free, exiting his cock as a load of cum. He could feel other things going with it-his love of video games, his straightness-but he didn’t care. He had a job now. Scoot and Ivan were right. The kitsune hovered all of it up and popped off his cock, burping in apparent satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Scoot and Ivan released their grips on his arms and Danny flopped dazedly onto the bed.  <br />
<br />
Danny found himself panting, staring up at the glass ceiling high above him, knowing something in him was missing, but not capable of remembering what that might be. His lovers lay next to him on the grand bed. His body felt strangely flexible, like his spine was made of rubber. Danny looked down at his cum covered body and realized something.<br />
<br />
He really need a shower.<br />
<br />
“That was some good shit Danny boy!” Yuyaku smiled. “Keep that up and maybe I’ll pay you a bit more after the shows.”<br />
<br />
“He’s got a nice, fuckable ass.” Ivan the tiger grinned. “Hope he lasts longer than the other one did.”<br />
<br />
“Me like him, he a good cock sucker” Scoot grinned dumbly, cock leaking precum on the floor.<br />
<br />
“You’re hired.” Yuyaku said. “Now take those keys and get showered. We’ll see you tomorrow at noon.”<br />
<br />
Danny blushed deeply, licking cum off his face. He swung himself off the bed, looking for his clothes, trying to find his shirt and dress pants. He put them on, but they didn’t seem to fit, far too small for his increasingly muscular frame.<br />
<br />
“Don’t fit, huh?” Yuyaku snapped his fingers. “I can fix that.”<br />
<br />
Dan felt his shirt tighten and glanced down. His shirt was altering, becoming pretty silvery muscle-shirt that showed off his muscles. Another snap, and Dan felt a pair of tight, glittering shorts appear on his legs, showing off his definition. Smirking, Dan sauntered to the door, ass swaying.<br />
<br />
“No betting.” The kitsune warned.<br />
<br />
“I won’t.” Dan nodded and left.<br />
<br />
As he walked down the hallway, Danny found himself surprised at how happy and confident he felt. People weren’t passing him by with stares of disgust anymore. He left the halls and walked past the main stage. The posters caught his eye. The poster for Akita had changed. <br />
<br />
Dan was in it, standing behind Yuyaku, next to the sexy tiger. Something about him seemed off, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He stared at his image, trying to puzzle out what it could be for a good minute before shrugging and continuing on his way.<br />
<br />
“Must be my imagination,” He shook his head. <br />
<br />
Just in case, Dan walked toward a mirror and checked his body. It appeared to be the same when he’d entered the kitsune’s room-a long white and black striped tail, white hair, sharp nails. Dan shrugged and made his way towards the main area of the Floor of Soul.<br />
<br />
He never noticed the strangers who crept behind him silently. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Dan was on edge. He’d finally made it to the hotel area, but he swore someone was following him. Of course, he’d never actually seen anyone behind him, but the hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end. <br />
<br />
It took him making three left turns for Danny to spot his pursuers. An anthro-stegosaurus, a Drider, a highly advanced sexbot-all three were pursuing him, though the crowd was keeping them at bay for now. <br />
<br />
Danny started to run.<br />
<br />
He rounded a corner and slammed into a large, sweaty, grey-green belly. Danny looked up and saw a brutish, 7 foot tall ogre. The ogre chuckled, big belly bouncing, and Dan smelt musk waft off the corpulent monster.<br />
<br />
“Hey Danny.” The Ogre grinned, showing his yellowing tusks, “Heard you were working with Akita.”<br />
<br />
Danny tried to run, but the ogre draped one meaty arm over his shoulder and pulled him close.<br />
<br />
“H-how do you know that?” Danny asked, wrinkling his nose at the stench of the ogre’s heavy musk.<br />
<br />
“My little birdies told me.” The ogre’s grin widened and he pressed something against the back of Danny’s head. “Let’s get you more comfortable, huh?”<br />
<br />
Danny blinked as the stench of the ogre’s musk shifted from disgusting to desirable. He found himself burying his nose into the ogre armpits, licking and sniffing deeply, cock suddenly hard. A part of him wanted to fight it, but damn this hot ogre daddy was ripe!<br />
<br />
“You newbies are so easy.” The ogre chuckled. “No defenses whatsoever. Maybe when you’ve served your purpose, you can stay with me. Would you like that, boy?”<br />
<br />
Danny snorted and snuffled.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take that as a yes.” The ogre grinned, and pulled own Danny’s pants. “Put your hole to work and listen.”<br />
<br />
Danny gasped as he felt the ogre’s thick shaft enter him, inch after inch, until he came to a halt at the base of the ogre’s balls. Danny insides began to squeeze and undulate automatically, making the ogre groan.<br />
<br />
“Damn, Akita really tricked you out, huh?” The ogre groaned, bouncing the demihuman up and down on his cock. “Won’t last long. You listening, boy?”<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy.” Danny’s eyes were glazed. “Whatever you want.”<br />
<br />
“Good. Me and my friends, who you managed to evade, placed a big bet against your boss. He only lost because of his missing assistant, so the money’s Akita winning.” The ogre smirked. “You’re gonna change all that.”<br />
<br />
“What did you do to his assistant?”<br />
<br />
“I <I>am</I> his assistant.” The ogre grinned. “I’m rid of that insufferable fox!”<br />
<br />
“But you lost.” Danny said, rubbing his face against the ogre’s massive chest. “I thought you were a blank.”<br />
<br />
“Oh sonny, you are so naive.” The ogre ran his hand up and down the man’s furry back. “Tell him, Deng-long.”<br />
<br />
“I bought his assistant, paid off his debts, gave him the form you worship as we speak.” A deep, melodious voice said.<br />
<br />
Danny turned and saw a kirin standing next to them, watching the ogre have his way with Danny.<br />
<br />
Deng-long’s body was a masterpiece. Silver scales mixed with fur covering a body that was a hybrid of a dragon, horse, and deer all blended together to create the perfect being. Like Danny, the Kirin wore only a thong, his powerful, well-defined muscles flexing as he shifted on his hooves. Jewelry was draped across his chest and his antlers were tipped with gold caps. <br />
<br />
The ogre groaned and Danny felt something warm and wet fill his insides in big spurts. Danny moaned happily and pulled himself off the dick to give the ogre a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Do you like my stage hand, Danny?” The kirin asked.<br />
<br />
Danny nodded as the ogre pulled out of him and set him carefully on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Then I need you to trust me. Give me your chips. All of them.” Deng-long smiled.<br />
<br />
“But I’ll become a Blank!” Danny protested.<br />
<br />
The ogre snorted.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m going to make a bet against your master with them.” The Kirin explained. “As long as he loses his next match, you’ll be fine. That’s all I need you to do. Screw up. Heck, you might even actually screw up without ever having to do anything nefarious.”<br />
<br />
“What if he wins?”<br />
<br />
“Then you are his. Which you are anyways, really.” The Kirin shrugged. “However, if I win, you’ll get 1/5 of the pot. With the payout the way it is, that would catapult you into the tippy-top.”<br />
<br />
“You’re already rich.” Danny quirked a brow. “That body of yours. I saw the auction house. Kirin are going for a billion in actual money.”<br />
<br />
“By playing smart. Spiking the pot.” Deng-long smiled. “Cheating, Danny.”<br />
<br />
“But my chips…”<br />
<br />
“Are in limbo until the winner is announced. And <I>you</I> have all the power. You can ruin the whole show and, like I said, that might happen regardless. Akita is off his game, you’re a complete newbie. No one is going to know you intentionally threw the match.”<br />
<br />
“He’s nice to me…” Danny protested.<br />
<br />
“He’s a kitsune.” Deng-long said flatly. “Spare me. He probably sucked out your soul the moment you agreed to be his apprentice.”<br />
<br />
“Won’t he know if I suddenly have a ton of chips after we lose?” Danny asked.<br />
<br />
“If you agree, I’ll give you a special body chip so you can hide from him after we win.” The ogre winked. “You and me can sweep Body competitions and all the sex we want.”<br />
<br />
“One loss won’t hurt the old kitsune, right? He’s got tons of chips…” Danny blushed. “So..yes!”<br />
<br />
The Kirin grinned and held out a hand. Danny shook it. Their hands suddenly glowed.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?!” Dan asked as the glow faded.<br />
<br />
“A binding contract to make sure we don’t screw each other without repercussions.” The kirin smiled.<br />
<br />
Danny swallowed nervously.<br />
<br />
“Trust me kid, you won’t regret this! Make it look good.” The kirin said, scales glittering along his horse-like body before they flashed, blinding Danny.<br />
<br />
When Danny opened his eyes again, the hallway was clear, no trace of the guys who had accosted him  anywhere.<br />
<br />
Danny patted himself down, matching his body to his memories, making sure everything was there. There shouldn’t be any overt signs of transformation if these guys wanted him to act as their saboteur. If they had, there was no way Yuyaku would miss it. His memories and body checked out. Danny sighed and entered his room, feeling a little bad for betraying his new master, but it was only one time, and failing his first time shouldn’t be all that surprising to anyone.</p>
