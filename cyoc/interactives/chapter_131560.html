<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The creep smiles and closes her door, finally leaving Becky alone in her apartment. She picks up the broken pieces of glass of her floor and mops up the wine off of her kitchen tile. She could just go back to her regular nightly routine and watch some Netflix while sipping some wine. But that creep of a neighbor keeps popping up in her head. He said he wouldn&#39;t tell anybody about her or the necklace, but what if he changes his mind? And without her necklace inhibiting her, she could easily overpower him if anything got weird. &quot;I probably should at least hear what he has to say.&quot; So she wrings out her mop and heads back into her bedroom. She plugs in her necklace into the charger on her night stand and goes into her walk-in closet to put on some clothes. &quot;He&#39;s already seen me half-naked but let&#39;s keep things covered.&quot; Becky pulls on a tight sports tee for her favorite hockey team without a bra because bursting out of her small bra left her breasts feeling a bit sore. The shirt fits her boobs so tightly that each one is fully outlined under her shirt but its the only thing she has thats clean and can fit her bigger body. And for bottoms she pulled out a pair of gray sweats that don&#39;t even reach her ankles. The difference in size between the two garments leaves a large gap of her stomach exposed but it&#39;s all that will fit her at the moment. And Becky doesn&#39;t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing her in one of her tight dancing dresses.<br />
<br />
Becky slides on her house slippers and walks out of her home and over to her the creep&#39;s door. She knocks once before the door pushes open, unlocked. &quot;Come on in. I&#39;m on the kitchen.&quot; She cautiously walks in the place and is greeted by large photographs all over his walls; of women in various seductive poses and states of undress, all very beautiful. One woman above his fireplace has her breasts fully exposed with her arms lifted above her head. It&#39;s all very provocative. She thought this pace would be more seedy but everything from the decor to the furniture to even the sexy protraits is all very sophisticated<br />
<br />
She eases herself onto his leather couch as he calls out from the kitchen. &quot;Welcome Becky. Since you dropped your drink, how about I make you a new one? You were drinking red wine right?&quot; He comes from the kitchen carrying a bottle of deep red wine and two glasses. He hands her one and pours her a healthy amount before sitting and pouring some for himself. He swirls it around before taking a sip. &quot;That&#39;s good stuff. So now Becky, as to why I&#39;ve asked you here. As you might have guessed, I am a photographer. And I want you to model for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know you&#39;re not just some perv with naked women on his walls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair question. I just like to display my art. Here, I had a coffee table book made of some of my best work.&quot; He gestures to a book on his coffee table while drinks more wine. Becky opens it up and flips through the many pages of beautifully posed women. She even recognizes some magazine covers and advertisements. Some celebrities are even posing in them. And at the bottom corner of every picture is the name &quot;Carlos Ricardo&quot;. &#39;That must be his name then&#39; she thinks to herself. &quot;You have a lot of beautiful work in here. But why do you want me? I&#39;ve never modeled before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can tell, my focus is on the beauty of the female form. Sometimes in motion, sometimes in contrast to man, but always the female form. And you are the most definitive example of the female form I have seen yet. Your proportions are near goddess-like. Even in that tight-as-sin bargain tee, you remain a fixture of beauty. I need to photograph you. I need you as my muse.&quot; Becky takes in his fancy words with a large swig of wine. &quot;Goes down smooth, doesn&#39;t it? Please Becky: pose for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She downs her glass and reaches for the bottle to fill it up again. Carlos watches her in amusement. &quot;I can hold alot of liquor before it hits me.&quot; But nonetheless, she gets more comfortable on his couch, laying back into it and spreading her free arm out over the top. &quot;But I have a job. I can&#39;t just quit to come over here and take pictures for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come after work around 6. I&#39;ll have my studio set up and waiting for you. And I&#39;ll pay you for the trouble. What do you say?&quot; Becky downs her second glass and thinks about it. &#39;It could be fun to loosen up after being buttoned up all day.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I&#39;ll do it on one condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot; He fills up her glass again. &quot;I don&#39;t want people to know it&#39;s me. I have a professional reputation to protect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlos swirls his wine in his glass. &quot;A mystery woman, eh? Just to let the body take focus of the image. Face always covered by a hat or hair or someone else&#39;s body? Normally I would say no but your body holds so much potential. Deal.&quot; He holds Becky&#39;s hand and helps her up while shaking it. &quot;Thank you for this Becky. You won&#39;t regret it. Here take the wine. You just about finished it off anyway.&quot; She takes the wine bottle and leaves the artist&#39;s apartment and enters her own once again. She pours herself another glass and nestles herself on her couch before peeling the t-shirt off her body. She tosses it behind the couch and flips on the TV to watch something on Netflix. She flips through while thinking about what she has gotten herself into.<br />
<br />
Becky stayed in the living room watching B-rated action flicks and comedies until midnight before getting up and heading over to her bed. And when her alarm clock chirps her awake at 7:30, she jumps out of bed ready to start the day regardless of her late night drinking through three bottles of wine. One of the benefits of being her is that she doesn&#39;t get hungover. She walks her already naked body over to her bathroom to shower and brush her teeth. She puts on her fully charged necklace and shrinks down to her work body. She always watches herself shrink in the mirror to remind herself why she even bothers with this whole process. But the work day won&#39;t wait for anybody so she picks out her clothes for work same as usual, eats breakfast same as usual, and leaves to catch the train same as usual.<br />
<br />
As always, no one gives her a second glance on the train or walking up to her building downtown. She quietly walks to her cubicle and sets up to start the day&#39;s work. Someone knocks on her wall and she looks up to see a smiling face there greeting her. It&#39;s Scott O&#39;Brien, one of her teammates on the big Smith & Smith Account. &quot;Good morning, Becky.&quot; He smiles his trademark handsome smile and she smiles back. He really is handsome with his thick back hair and whopping green eyes. Becky has caught herself checking him out on multiple occasions, just like half the other girls in the office. But she&#39;s only one that works with him so she gets away with it. Most of the girls in thw office claims to have seen date some guy so he wouldn&#39;t even be interested. And besides, her smaller body isn&#39;t nearly as attractive as her real one: how could he ever find her more than just averagely pretty? &quot;Good morning, Scott. I&#39;ll email my report to you just as soon as Ian finishes with his number crunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thanks, Becky. Just as reliable as always.&quot; Business as usual and one more day of holding herself back. Becky frowns slightly, &#39;That&#39;s me. Good &#39;Ole reliable Becky&#39;. Scott sees his mistake and tries to fix his choice of words. &quot;No no no. That&#39;s not what I meant. I just meant to say that you do good work and I can always count on you.&quot; He rubs his neck in defeat. &quot;No that doesn&#39;t sound right, either. Good going O&#39;Brien.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Scott. I know what you meant. I just had something else on my mind. No harm, no foul.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face brightens up again. &quot;Really? Oh good, that&#39;s good. Well I&#39;ll leave you to your work.&quot; Scott starts to walk away but zips right back. &quot;Um, Becky. I was actually wondering if I could ask you something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you be willing to have lunch with me today? Or coffee after work? You know, together?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky is flabbergasted. Is he actually asking her out? She thought her crush was only a once-sided office fantasy. But he actually likes her? No one has ever asked her out in this form before. But seeing his face slowly droop, she needs to say something quick. &quot;Uh, I&#39;d love to have lunch with you. Meet me at the elevator at 11:30?&quot;<br />
<br />
His frown turns upside down. &quot;Really? Okay great! Great! I&#39;ll see you then.&quot; He starts to back away until he bumps into a courier carrying a stack of memos. Becky laughs, she thinks he&#39;s cute when he&#39;s this clumsy. Maybe this is a sign that her life is moving up and not to be worried about meeting up with Carlos tonight.<br />
<br />
Becky watches the clock tick and tock away until its 11:25. She shuts down her computer and packs up her things in her desk and eagerly grabs her purse to head for the elevator. And waiting for her is Scott. &quot;Hi Becky. Are you ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; And they head into the elevator together. Their lunch date takes them to a nearby bar & grill they both like and they both relax and start talking about work. Then slowly coversation turns to their favorite hockey team that&#39;s playing on the TV. Then it turns to their hobbies and what they enjoy doing after work. Just like her, Scott is more of a homebody but also likes to play in a local basketball league. Luckily, Becky loves all sports so unlike other girls he&#39;s dated, she stays interested. The two of them really click so well they almost don&#39;t make it back to work on time. They race back to their office building and barely manage to catch the elevator. While Scott is recovering from sprinting for two blocks, he laughs. &quot;Well we cut it pretty close. You sure can run pretty fa...&quot; He doesn&#39;t finish his sentence as Becky shuts him up with a peck on the lips. She wasn&#39;t planning on being this forward on their first date, but she really had a good time. She pulls away before they get to their floor, but then he kisses her back. Instead of letting him let go, Becky leans into it and they start making out properly in the elevator. He starts holding her by her hips and she runs her hands through his jet black hair. Buttons start getting jerked open and hair gets tussled. They almost don&#39;t seperate and tidy themselves up in time before the door dings open at their floor. A secretary waiting eyes them both suspiciously as the couple blushes and rushes back to their desks to get back to work. As she slides back into her chair and logs onto her computer, Becky grins to herself. &quot;Maybe this whole modeling thing is a good idea.&quot; She hasn&#39;t felt this sexy and herself in this body ever. And she liked it.<br />
<br />
Her sensuous energy carries on the whole day. And by the time 4:30 rolls around, she is excited to be able to go home and let loose. While walking out of the building at the end of the work day, Scott manages to catch up with Becky on her way out. &quot;Hey Becky. Where are you headed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just home. And thanks for that &#39;paperwork&#39; you filed earlier. I found the numbers very provocative.&quot; Scott gulps and doesn&#39;t quite get her wordplay. &quot;Huh?&quot; He stops along the sidewalk for a bit confused but Becky takes his hand and pulls him along. They walk hand in hand for a few blocks until they reach the stairs to her subway terminal. &quot;I had alot of fun today, Scott.&quot; She intertwines both sets of fingers through his his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too Becky. Could we maybe do this again sometime?&quot;<br />
<br />
She pauses to fake-think about it and pulls him over into a small alley. They are far enough away from their workplace so that no one they know will see them make out. She pushes him up against the brick wall of a bodega and they continue their after lunch &#39;snack&#39;. &#39;Screw Carlos and his photoshoot&#39; thinks Becky. &#39;I could dotl this all night.&#39; But after a few minutes, he gently pushes her away and checks his phone. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my neighbor. They have to go somewhere urgent and they need me to watch their dog. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I get it. But I was really enjoying myself there. We are definitely going to have to finish this tomorrow.&quot; He flips her around so she is against the brick now. &quot;Definitely. I&#39;ll text you.&quot; He kisses her one last time before he leaves to go home. Becky, in complete ecstasy, practically floats down to her subway terminal to do the same.<br />
<br />
Becky makes it back to her apartment around 5, still in the same dazed state as before. &quot;I&#39;m dating Scott O&#39;Brien!&quot; In pure happiness, she squeals and jumps onto her bed and holds her pillow tight against her chest. Her phone chirps in her purse so she gets up to check it. It&#39;s from Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Becky. I was thinking about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggles and types back. &quot;What were you thinking about? &quot; a few seconds later his reply pops up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d be such a good kisser. You&#39;re probably the best I&#39;ve ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky laughs. &quot;Well there&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t know about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to get to know you better. Much better. Can we do lunch again tomorrow?&quot; Becky could&#39;ve just said yes but her stomach is swirling from all that attention she got earlier. So instead, she types &quot;We can do much more than lunch.&quot; He takes a minute to process her words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait. Maybe you can call me later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky looks at her clock. 5:45. She needs to get over to Carlos&#39;s studio. &quot;Maybe but I need to step out for a while. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, bye Becky.&quot;<br />
<br />
She squeals again and jumps up and into her closet. She&#39;ll keep the necklace on for now but she takes off her bra and throws on some granny panties. Once she grows, it&#39;ll be very uncomfortable to have anything to tight on and the panties will stretch. She throws on a large purple maxi dress and sweater that she washed last night that she knows both of her selves can fit into. She flips on some flip flops grabs her phone and walks over to Carlos&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Becky knocks on the door, and just like yesterday, it pushes open. The kitchen is empty but she can hear him playing music in the back bedrooms. She follows the smooth music into the last door in the hall where Carlos is finishing up angling up bunch of lights and cameras for the shoot. &quot;Becky! Come in, come in. I&#39;ve been so excited for you to join me tonight. We&#39;re going to make some magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh okay. What do you need me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first I need you to change back into your &#39;regular&#39; body. Go ahead and take the necklace off.&quot; No longer self conscious about her true body thanks to her escapade with Scott, Becky takes off her necklace and places it on a camera case withe her phone. Instantly her body starts to grow. Her spine tingles as it stretches taller and taller as her torso and shoulder grows wider and thicker. Her short & mousy brown hair flows into a dark chocolate wave down to her stomach. Once her bones have all grown, the meat of her body fills in as her muscles plump up and trim her figure down. Her breasts have filled up as if connected to a hose and they become weighty yet still perky. And as big as her breasts grew, her ass tripled them in size, becoming thick and juicy. If you were to touch them, they would be jucier than a whole orchard of peaches. Those, plus the muscle gains in her arms and legs, make Becky look like a svelte and sexy Amazon. And thanks to the clothes Becky picked out, none of her body has managed to break out of her now very tight and shorter dress, even if her breasts are out in full view of Carlos and his camera. Carlos applauds in appreciation. &quot;I will never get tired off that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ready to begin, Becky sits down at the stool positioned in front of the camera. &quot;Let&#39;s get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very forward today. What changed?&quot; He snaps a few photos.<br />
<br />
&quot;I met someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? Put you arms in your lap please. What&#39;s his name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott. We work together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he sounds handsome. Is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes he is.&quot; She rubs her hands on her thighs, but Carlos says nothing about it. &quot;What do like you about him? What makes him handsome?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s tall and has these perfect green eyes.&quot; She starts to get hot under her spaghetti straps and starts to rub her chest. Carlos silently keeps snapping photos of her arousal in motion. &quot;Go on. What else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He has thick black hair and the most amazing smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds hot. Does he work out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he plays basketball on the weekends. He has the cutest little butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naughty girl, Becky. You peeked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot; She&#39;s really getting worked up now. Her head is starting to spin. &quot;He&#39;s the hottest guy in the office. I can&#39;t wait to kiss him tomorrow.&quot; She starts running her hands through her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are going to do to him tomorrow?&quot; Carlos starts snapping photos faster and faster as he starts to get aroused himself. Becky holds onto the stool in between her legs and rocks her hips over the wooden seat. &quot;I want to fuck him.&quot; Happy with his progress, Carlos picks up her phone and scrolls through her contacts. He hands the phone to Becky. She picks it up just as Scott answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky, how&#39;s it going? I&#39;m just leaving my neighbors place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss you, Scotty.&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckles. &quot;Oh really? Well I miss you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you. Scott I want you bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of him dropping his keys can be heard over the phone. He scurries to pick them up. &quot;Oh, y-yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I had fun in the elevator today, but I wish the door didn&#39;t open.&quot; Carlos raises an eyebrow  but keeps photographing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You liked that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. I didn&#39;t want to go to far to fast but I couldn&#39;t stop myself. I think you&#39;re super sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think you&#39;re the most sensuous woman I know. You keep everything so tight and cleaned up at work. Who knew you had a little freak in you?&quot; She liked that. &quot;Say it again, Scotty.&quot; She starts to pull up her dress to touch herself as the pressure in her cunt grows hotter and hotter.<br />
<br />
O&#39;Brien couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing but he keeps playing the game. &quot;You&#39;re a freak, Becky.&quot; She sticks one finger in. &quot;Keep talking Scotty. Keep going!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you want to feel me, feeling you. Being inside you, beside inside me.&quot; Becky starts to moan as her second finger goes goes inside her womanly folds and starts rubbing on her clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a little freak and you want to get more and more of me inside you. Deeper...&quot; three of her fingers are inside her now as her body aches with anticipation. On the other end, Scotty is laying on his couch seriously enjoying this too, with his pants undone and his dick getting pumped by his free hand. &quot;...and deeper until you can&#39;t even speak. How does that sound, little freak?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky moans hard into the receiver. Both Scott and Carlos are seriously turned on right, but Carlos has a job to do. He takes walks over to a distracted Becky and tries to lift her up. He almost doesn&#39;t make it, but he manages to get her to lay on the floor, with one of her breasts coming out of the dress in the process. He quickly gets his lights refocused and continues the shoot. Almost her whole hand is inside her and she is close to just sticking her phone inside and hitting vibrate. &quot;I&#39;m so hard right now Becky. Are you turned on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost can&#39;t hold it in.&quot; Becky can hear him grunting on the other end of the line. &quot;Finish with me Scotty.&quot; The couple continues to masturbate together until they both grunt out of their climax and are left gasping for air. Carlos gets all of her reactions on film and packs up his film reel for safe storage while Becky calms herself down. Scott speaks up on the other end &quot;Wow Becky, that was something, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so much for taking it slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m happy you called. That was a nice surprise. Can we meet again tomorrow at lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Scott. I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye babe.&quot; And he clicks off the phone. Becky, realizing her predicament, starts to lift herself off the floor. She blushes while she pulls her dress over her breast once more and smoothes out the skirt. Carlos is standing right there in his director&#39;s chair smiling. &quot;That was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for all that to happen. I&#39;m sorry, Carlos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry? My work is in the beauty of the female form. Nothing is better than capturing a woman&#39;s most feminine sexual energy.&quot; She looks down at his body, his own erection standing at full attention. &quot;And this little thing? Don&#39;t worry Becky. While I take all comers, I prefer guys personally. I just love the process of my art to the point of lust.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grabs her necklace and starts to leave this strange man&#39;s place. &quot;I know I told you I would pay you. I have to get these photos sold first so you&#39;ll get your money next week. Same time good for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both uncomfortable and intrigued, Becky nods and goes home to clean herself off and drink some wine before bed. &quot;And give that boytoy of yours my congratulations. He&#39;s going to have a good time with you around.&quot;</p>
