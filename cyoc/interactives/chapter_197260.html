<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were quiet in the convertible as Amielle drove.  Toni turned on the CD player, and was pleasantly surprised to find their borrowed vehicle&#39;s owner was a Pink Floyd fan.  &#39;Us and Them&#39; played while they were each left alone with their thoughts.<br />
<br />
Danielle was still crying in the back seat, with Gemory holding her, trying to sooth the girl, who kept saying she belonged in Hell.<br />
<br />
Toni looked at Amielle, whose face was uncharacteristically solemn.  She had no idea where the Angel was going, but she seemed to have a destination in mind.<br />
<br />
They drove for hours, and it was night by the time they reached their destination, a white Victorian-style house, with a red roof, surrounded by trees and carefully tended shrubbery.  A sign proclaimed it to be the Kingsley House.  Amielle parked.<br />
<br />
“A safe house?” Gemory asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”  Amielle replied. <br />
<br />
“And you&#39;re letting us in?”  The demon pressed.<br />
<br />
Amielle turned and golden eyes met blue.  “I am.  Do you want to make an issue of it?”<br />
<br />
Gemory bowed her head.  “No.  Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not doing this for you.”  Was the Angel&#39;s terse reply.  She got out of the car, without even looking to Toni, who felt stinging tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Gemory reached out to touch her the shoulder of her Succubi.  “Go to her.  She&#39;s not angry with you, but with herself.”<br />
<br />
Nodding, Toni got out and ran after her Angel.<br />
<br />
Gemory brushed the hair out of Danielle&#39;s eyes.  “Can you walk, honey?”<br />
<br />
“I...don&#39;t know.  I feel so weak.”<br />
<br />
“You used a lot of your magic.  I forgot to tell you- even though the power comes from me, channeling it with a mortal body is exhausting.  Especially when strong emotions are involved.  Kick me later, ok?  I&#39;m so used to not explaining the fine print to mortals...but that&#39;s no excuse.”  <br />
<br />
Dani managed a weak smile. “Can I spank you instead?”<br />
<br />
“Well yes, but that&#39;s not much of a punishment.  I&#39;ll enjoy it.”  She kissed Danielle, then helped her out of the car, then picked her up in a bridal carry.  <br />
<br />
Danielle put her arms around her fiancee.  “I wish we were married.”<br />
<br />
“Soon, my love.  Very soon.  I know this isn&#39;t what you want to hear, but you&#39;re sexy when you&#39;re angry.  Francesca is going to be angry at me when I rip this dress off of you.”<br />
<br />
Danielle managed a weak laugh.  “I thought you were upset with me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh by Lucifer, no!  Never!  Love, I knew you were holding in a lot of anger.  I am cross, but with myself.  I was so distracted by how hot you were, that I didn&#39;t step in sooner.”<br />
<br />
“So I did go too far then.”  Dani said, her voice weak.<br />
<br />
“Nah!  Now if you&#39;d turned her into a baby, -that- might have been too much.  Ok, making her a perv target probably crossed the line a little.  But nobody could say you didn&#39;t give her the youth and beauty she always wanted.  Just goes to show there is too much of a good thing.”  Gemory kissed her lover as she brought her up the steps.<br />
<br />
Amielle was talking to an Angel, who was looking at her unwelcome guests with open dismay.  The Angel was wearing the shape of a woman in her late 40&#39;s, but she quickly shed it once the door was closed, turning into a tall, Nordic-looking young woman.<br />
<br />
“By Lucifer, you&#39;re a Valkyrie!”  Gemory was surprised.<br />
<br />
The tall blonde looked annoyed.  “Could you not?  If you must swear, I understand why you won&#39;t say God&#39;s name, but try not to attract the attention of Hell.”<br />
<br />
“My apologies, Lady Valkyrie.”  Gemory nodded her head, showing uncharacteristic respect.  “By Loki, then?”<br />
<br />
The Valkyrie rolled her eyes.  “I am Mist.  Pretend it&#39;s short for Mistress.  It&#39;s not, but this place is under my watch.  I&#39;m surprised your feet aren&#39;t burning holes in the carpeting, Duke Gemory.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I&#39;m levitating.”  Gemory replied.  And if one examined closely, they&#39;d realize it was true- her feet were a good quarter inch off the floor.  “If we&#39;re welcome here, I&#39;ll seal my power properly.”<br />
<br />
Mist frowned.  “I&#39;m not sure &#39;welcome&#39; is the right word, but Amielle has asked for right of Sanctuary, and while it&#39;s rarely invoked on behalf of the Fallen, there&#39;s no restriction against it.  You know the rules, I&#39;m sure you can handle your...Succubus.  But what about the mortal girl?”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s a polite and well-mannered girl, you shouldn&#39;t have any problems with her.  But we&#39;ll explain just in case.  Either way, if she or Toni wrong you or your house, I&#39;ll let you take it out of my hide.”  Gemory stated.<br />
<br />
“Let me, huh?”  Mist grinned.<br />
<br />
“I know you&#39;d probably prefer if I put up a fight, but yes.”<br />
<br />
The Valkyrie&#39;s expression softened.  “I didn&#39;t believe Amielle, but you really do care for the girl.”<br />
<br />
“I do.”  Gemory said.  Danielle had passed out in her arms, but she cradled the taller girl gently.<br />
<br />
“Well...damn.”  Mist said.<br />
<br />
“Too late.”<br />
<br />
<br />
After Gemory put Dani to bed, the four supernatural beings gathered in the living room.  Despite it being summer, Mist started a fire, and the two demons happily sat near it.  While not all of Hell is hot, it was what they were used to, and even on a warm summer day, Earth felt a little chilly.<br />
<br />
Then again, it wasn&#39;t like demons were known for covering up.<br />
<br />
Gemory decided to tell Mist the whole story.  Not that she could have left anything out, Ami was still giving her a cold glare.  That was something she&#39;d have to address, in private.<br />
<br />
Toni still looked like she was suffering without the touch of her beloved Angel as she sat quietly.<br />
<br />
Mist sat back, looking thoughtful.  “So that&#39;s your Doom, is it, Gemory?  To fall in love with a mortal girl?”<br />
<br />
“So it would seem.”  Gemory sighed.  “I don&#39;t see it as a curse though, even if most people would.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s love for you.  A poison that fills you with pleasure, then pain.”  <br />
<br />
“Been there, I take it?”  Gemory raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Aye.  It&#39;s why I&#39;m stationed here on Earth.  I fell in love with a man, and gave him a child.  Normally, I&#39;d have been cast out, but...&#39;in light of my exemplary record&#39;, I was allowed to serve.  Bastards wanted to retire me anyways.  Not much use for Angels of Death these days.  Mortals are too good at killing each other off.”  Mist shook her head.  “But of course, he died in time.”<br />
<br />
“You gave birth to a Nephilim?  And they let you keep the child?”  Gemory was surprised.<br />
<br />
“She had her powers bound at birth.  Even her womb is sealed...she believes she&#39;s barren, the poor child.  She&#39;s married now, to a good man.  They adopted.  She&#39;ll outlive him, of course.  One day, the seal will start to break, she&#39;ll see a young woman in the mirror, and I&#39;m not looking forward to that phone call.”  Mist frowned.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s the funny thing about Nephilim.  They either grow up insanely fast, or take decades.  But either way, they&#39;re almost immortal.”  Gemory nodded.  “I guess it&#39;s fortunate she had a normal childhood.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose so, but when she realizes she looks younger than her own children...she&#39;s going to be cross with me for not telling her the truth.”  Mist looked into the fire.  “I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve ever had children?”<br />
<br />
“It was a long time ago.”  Gemory looked into the fire herself.  “I didn&#39;t carry them myself.  I Fell long before Raphael&#39;s Ban.  I couldn&#39;t love them, but I cared for them.  They were mine.  Then the Angels took them away from me.  If they were slain, or simply banished to some unknown land, I can&#39;t say.”<br />
<br />
“You have regrets.  The mortal girl has changed you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Before now, all I had was anger towards your kind.”  Gemory admitted.<br />
<br />
“Our kind.  Fallen or not, you were created by God&#39;s Will, the same as I.  What was your duty, before?” Mist asked, her voice gentle.<br />
<br />
“I was a Virtue.  God named me Gemiel.  I was a dancer.  That&#39;s all I was for.  To dance and sing the praises of God in the Temple.  Just a pretty, empty headed flower.”<br />
<br />
“Like me.”  Amielle spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Like you.  I guess that&#39;s why you annoy me, Featherhead.  You remind me of what I used to be.  I was happy then.  At least, I think I was.  I didn&#39;t know what sorrow or pain meant.  God loved me, and so I danced for their pleasure.”  Gemory felt her eyes tear up, but she let them flow, even as the tears seared her skin.  Demons were not meant to cry.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, Amielle got up, and walked to Toni, taking her hand.  Then, she curled up next to Gemory, holding her.  Toni flanked Gemory, doing the same.<br />
<br />
Gemory felt the touch of feathers, and realized Amielle had extended one wing around her body.  “Amielle...”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s ok.  I might as well use them while I have them.”  Amielle said, even as the feathers that touched Gemory turned black.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m corrupting you.”<br />
<br />
“I think it&#39;s too late to worry about that now.  Can you tell me what happened next?”<br />
<br />
Gemory paused to kiss Toni on the forehead, and the tiny blonde sighed with contentment.  &#39;Hm, seems to be a lot of blondes around lately.  I should make Toni change her hair.  Actually, that&#39;s not fair.  I should change mine.  I wonder what color Dani would like?&#39;<br />
<br />
“Well.  Even Angels get breaks.  We worked in shifts, those of us who sang and danced for God.  I didn&#39;t really have hobbies, so I would lay down naked in the soft grass at the shore of the river, dangling my feet in the cool water, and stare at the sky.<br />
<br />
One day, Paimon came up to me.  I...I can&#39;t use his real name.  It was taken from him.”  She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the girls hold her tighter.  This was painful, but she couldn&#39;t stop now.<br />
<br />
“He asked me what I was doing.  And I didn&#39;t have an answer for him.  He came by every day and asked me the same question.  Eventually, I had an answer for him.  &#39;I&#39;m looking&#39;, I said.<br />
<br />
<br />
&#39;What are you looking at?&#39;, he replied.  And I said...&#39;Everything.  It&#39;s all so beautiful.&#39;  He sat down with me then, and started to explain to me what I was seeing.  He could name every star in the sky.  He could look back to the moment of Creation itself, and even see into the future.  He taught me these things, even though I was never meant to do anything but dance.  And I felt my mind expanding.  I became hungry for knowledge.<br />
<br />
And for him.  We weren&#39;t made to have sex, of course.  That was for lesser creatures.  But we could love another, in our own way.  Over time, I became less pleased with my life.  I could still dance, of course.  But I no longer felt the same passion for it.  I was going through the motions.  I didn&#39;t think anyone noticed, but the Morning Star did.<br />
<br />
One day, when I was watching the sky, he came to me.  &#39;Gemiel.  Will you walk with me?&#39;<br />
<br />
Well!  He was the Morning Star!  God&#39;s favorite!  He even rivaled Sandalphon!  This was in the time before Metatron was appointed to be God&#39;s Voice, of course.  There are no words to describe how beautiful He was.  I was in awe.  He towered over me, and he had six wings...and his halo crowned his head like the sun!”<br />
<br />
Gemory&#39;s eyes shined with the memory.  “Anyways, he brought me to Earth, and he showed me The Garden.  I had heard the rumors, that God had begun to Create again.  The Bible, as you know, talks about Six Days, but it was more like Six Phases.  Each Phase took a very long time, and God did rest between them.  The Seventh Phase was when God looked around and decided their work was done.<br />
<br />
The Garden, you see, was like God&#39;s workshop.  A pristine, perfect environment, where their creations could grow, evolve, and adapt under observation.  I admit, I wasn&#39;t impressed by Adam and Lilith.  I mean, by mortal standards, they were perfect.  But they were so limited compared to Angels, I couldn&#39;t see the point!  They weren&#39;t animals, but they weren&#39;t Elohim or Malakim either.<br />
<br />
&#39;Do you see there, what God has made?  An animal to rule over all the others.  The King of Beasts.  Ish and Isha.&#39;<br />
<br />
I remember looking at them, and seeing how they were different from one another.  And, I had to admit, though crude, I did admire their forms.  They were made by God&#39;s Will, the same as I, after all.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why does God need a ruler over Beasts?  Is not God ruler?&#39;  I asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;A good question.  Ah, look.  The male wishes to mate with the female.&#39;<br />
<br />
And sure enough, Adam gestured to the animals, then let his intent be known.  And Lilith told him to lay down, and she would mount him.”  Gemory giggled at the memory.  “Well, you know the story, I&#39;m sure.  Adam didn&#39;t like that, and he tried to force Lilith.  But even though the word &#39;Isha&#39; means &#39;fragile&#39;, Lilith was anything but.  She was just as tall and strong as Adam, and on that day, she invented the nut shot.”<br />
<br />
Even Mist laughed at that, deep and throaty.  It was a man&#39;s laugh, and everyone felt more at ease afterwards.<br />
<br />
“Well, after that, Lilith kicked Adam out of their cave, and God found him outside at night, shivering from the cold, with no shelter.  I expected Lilith to be punished, but when God asked her to lay with Adam, she replied that she&#39;d rather mate with a lion.  It&#39;s funny now, but at the time, I remember looking to Lucifer in shock.<br />
<br />
&#39;The Isha...said no...to God?!&#39;  I couldn&#39;t comprehend such a thing.  No one refused God&#39;s Will!  It was unthinkable!  And Lucifer just sighed, looking sad.  &#39;He has given them Free Will.&#39;<br />
<br />
I wandered away after that.   I didn&#39;t go back to the temple when it was my shift.  I sat by the river, staring into the water.  I don&#39;t know how long I was there before Paimon came to find me.<br />
<br />
&#39;Gemiel, why do you stare at the water?&#39;  He asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not staring at the water.  I am staring at nothing at all.&#39;  He bade me to walk with him, and we went to Earth.  Lilith was gone.  God had replaced her with Eve.  Eve was smaller and weaker than Adam, and submissive to him.  She basically worshipped the ground he walked upon.  Now, I&#39;m not saying Adam was a bad person.  He was the first, and God never bothered to teach him how to treat a woman.  He had to learn that the hard way.”<br />
<br />
“What happened to Lilith?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I wasn&#39;t there for it, but what I heard later was that she and God had a long talk.  They discussed all sorts of things, and Lilith asked him what her purpose was.  God isn&#39;t big on explanations, so they said something along the lines of &#39;to please me&#39;.<br />
<br />
Lilith took that the totally wrong way, and made a pass at her Creator.”<br />
<br />
Even Mist looked shocked.  As an Angel of Death, she had to be fairly old, but of course, this story took place before Death was a thing.  “I never knew.”<br />
<br />
“No, I imagine it&#39;s not something Angels talk about.  Demons, on the other hand- we love gossip.  And the Grigori were the worst gossips around.  God had taken a human form, and with it, all the traits of a human.  So when Lilith put God&#39;s dick in her mouth, well, you can imagine how that went.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!”  Toni said, then regretted it, as her mouth started smoking.  “Ahh!  It burns!”<br />
<br />
Mist acted quickly and offered the Succubus girl a glass of water, which she downed quickly.  “Thank you”, Toni said, subdued, her burned mouth slurring her words.<br />
<br />
Gemory nudged Amielle.  “Give your girlfriend a kiss.  She deserves it.”<br />
<br />
Ami nodded and sat with Toni.  Gemory gave them a few minutes to make up properly before continuing with her tale.  “Good to see you two are lovey dovey again.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, Toni.  I didn&#39;t mean to give you the cold shoulder.  Forgive me?”<br />
<br />
Toni smiled, her mouth feeling a lot better after kissing the Angel.  “I&#39;ll spank you later.”<br />
<br />
Ami looked shocked, then smiled, and cuddled with her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Ah, young love.” Mist sighed.  “But please, continue.  I never heard this side of the story before.”<br />
<br />
“Not worried that I&#39;m lying?”  Gemory gave the Valkyrie a wry smile.<br />
<br />
“Loki himself would have a hard time lying to me in my own House.  Though I expect this to be somewhat...abridged.”<br />
<br />
Gemory laughed.  “By which you mean edited.  Well, you might be surprised.  Anyways, yeah, having had sex with her Creator, Lilith ceased to be human.  She wasn&#39;t quite Elohim, but she had taken on some aspects of God&#39;s divinity.  This troubled God greatly.  Even more so, when Lilith&#39;s belly grew, and it was obvious, she was pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“Blasphemy!”  Amielle spat.  “You&#39;re lying!  Jesus is God&#39;s only Son!”<br />
<br />
Gemory looked to Amielle.  “I am not lying.  Yahosua is God&#39;s only Son.  But he has an older sister.”<br />
<br />
Amielle looked stricken and shuddered, fear in her eyes.  “No..no...how...how could I not know that?”<br />
<br />
“Knowledge of her wasn&#39;t always forbidden.  At one time the Gnostics had a name for her, though, being mortals, they got a lot of facts wrong.  Her name was Sophia.  Since she was half-God, she was part of God, yet separate.  Now with Yahosua, God had a plan.  To let the boy grow up mortal, and, after living a life on Earth, to ascend to Heaven.  This would ensure that there was a clear division, just how a baby, once born, is no longer part of their mother, but a truly separate being.<br />
<br />
Sophia didn&#39;t have this luxury.  She was born being fully aware of the universe, and her powers.  And, sadly, her place in it, which is to say, no place.  She was never intended to exist.  So she had the mother of all existential crises while Lilith was still breast feeding her.  She realized that if she remained close to God, she might be reabsorbed and cease to exist, so she pleaded with her mother to flee from God.  And so they did.<br />
<br />
Not trusting the Malak with the details of their..indiscretion, God pursued Lilith and Sophia personally, and that&#39;s when things went horribly south.” <br />
<br />
Gemory paused.  “Now I know what you might be thinking.  Isn&#39;t God omniscient?  Well, as Paimon explained to me, looking into the future is hard.  You can&#39;t do it constantly.  It&#39;s always changing, and even Paimon can only grasp the general shape of how things will occur over long periods of time.  I&#39;m not half as good as he is, and I have trouble seeing more than a few decades these days.  Now even though God&#39;s power is a whole order of magnitude greater than Paimon&#39;s, even God has to stop and LOOK.  And it&#39;s fair to point out that God never claimed to be omniscient- we just assumed God was.  It&#39;s hard to call some of these events mistakes, because, unlike Yahosua or Sophia, I can&#39;t look into the mind of God.  Even I have to admit that the general shape of God&#39;s Plan seems to be in motion, even if there have been some serious disruptions.<br />
<br />
Whether that&#39;s because God is an amazing planner, or just really good at damage control, I leave up to you to decide.  Either way, that&#39;s what sets up the next part.<br />
<br />
When God left, Sandalphon was put in charge instead of Lucifer.  I assume it&#39;s because Lucifer was the most independent-minded of us.  Other than Tabris, of course, but even he was created after this.  God was still working out the kinks of free will, and I&#39;m sure all of this is the reason they realized they needed a Malak of Free Will to really grasp how unpredictable humans can be.<br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t sit well with Lucifer at all, as you might imagine.  We weren&#39;t created to be prideful or vain, but since we had the capacity for love, we had the potential to develop other emotions.  And Luci got a huge double dose.  <br />
<br />
He gathered up the Grigori, who knew exactly what was going on, and spread the word.  God was replacing the Malak with this new &#39;man-animal&#39;.  Who could tell God where to stick it where even they don&#39;t shine.  Now, even the Grigori didn&#39;t know about what happened with Lilith, or the Rebellion might have been an outright mutiny.  We&#39;ll never know.<br />
<br />
Either way, about half the Malak were pissed.  Now, there was never any intention of phasing us out to my knowledge, that was just Luciferian propaganda.  But the fact that these...lesser beings...were given such freedom chafed us.  Sure, they were the Kings of Beasts...but would they be the Kings of us, as well?  What was their purpose?  What was ours?<br />
<br />
Anyways, you know the rest.  Lucifer marched on the Temple and confronted Sandalphon.  Sandalphon refused to entertain Luci&#39;s rhetoric, and told us to get back to work.  Luci was like, &#39;make us&#39;.<br />
<br />
And old Sandy had no idea what to do!  A strike against Heaven?  Against God&#39;s Mandate?  Malak refusing to do what they were made to do?  Sandalphon is a good leader, and very strong, but he was outnumbered...and let&#39;s be fair, not made to be much of a lateral thinker.<br />
<br />
So Lucifer was basically doing whatever he wanted, and the other Malak were just left to watch.  And the longer this went on, the more...let&#39;s be honest...delusional Luci was starting to sound.  I was part of his Inner Circle, but others were closer to him, and had his ear.  I don&#39;t know who had the idea.  I don&#39;t think it was Luci.  But he was desperate to do something, anything, to stick it to his Creator.<br />
<br />
One of the Grigori told him about the experiment.  God placed two Trees in the Garden- you know the story.  One would grant immortality and eternal youth, making the one who ate it strong and powerful- more like us, you see.<br />
<br />
The other Tree would grant knowledge of the universe.  With the ability to question Creation, and seek out answers.  More like God.  Now, God didn&#39;t actually say you couldn&#39;t eat from this Tree&#39;s fruit...which by the way, was definitely -not- an apple.<br />
<br />
What God had said was, you only get one.  Not both.  Now Adam may not have been the sharpest tool in the shed, but even he realized that not aging or getting sick was a great deal, so he happily ignored the Fruit of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Luci decided to disrupt the experiment.  Despite being genetically identical to Adam...basically closer to him than his sister, Lilith...yeah incest was totally fair game in the early days.  I mean, with the Fruit of Life, any kids you had would be healthy no matter what.  Anyways, despite that, Eve was a fair bit smarter than Adam, and really curious.  She would pester him all day, asking questions, and I&#39;m sure he was the first man ever to ask his wife to leave him alone and make him a sandwich!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t remember which Angel took the form of the serpent.  It wasn&#39;t Luci, he was way too prideful to take on an animal form.  If he was going to shapechange, he would take a form that combined all the best traits of anything God Created.  We weren&#39;t terribly original back then, but we knew a good idea when we saw it.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, so Lucifer really was a dragon?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah.  Fat lot of good it did him, but I&#39;ll get to that.  So whichever one of us it was, you know what happens next.  The serpent got chummy with Eve, and started answering her questions- which would lead to more questions.  Until finally, she was so worked up, she asked the question.  The big one.  The one that Lilith had asked.  &#39;Why do I exist?&#39;<br />
<br />
And the Serpent said, &#39;well, I don&#39;t know.  None of us do.  But you know, there&#39;s that other Tree over there.  I heard whoever eats it&#39;s fruit, will know everything.&#39;  Which is a big, giant, fatass lie, but with a bit of truth to it.  The Fruit of Knowledge would give someone the -potential- to figure out everything.<br />
<br />
So Eve took a bite, and suddenly, her brain was full of all kinds of new ideas and revelations.  She went to Adam, and, don&#39;t let a Sunday School teacher fool you- there was no &#39;feminine wiles&#39; involved.  She said &#39;hey, I ate this, and I know stuff!&#39; and Adam was all, &#39;no way is a woman smarter than me!&#39; and he chowed down!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know how Mi-ka-il heard about this, but he was pissed!  Mi-ka-il, or Michael, was just an Archangel.  His job was to fix things.  Even in Heaven, sometimes stuff got damaged or wore out, so he was God&#39;s handyman.  Good guy, Dani&#39;s Dad, Jack, reminds me of him.”<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled.  “He had strong hands.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, wait, wait, you had sex with MICHAEL THE FUCKING ARCHANGEL?!”  Amielle was shocked, then suddenly, she needed a glass of water for her scalding tongue.<br />
<br />
“Tsk, you&#39;re a lightweight, Ami.  A curse like that wouldn&#39;t even bother the average Angel.”  Gemory teased.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s right, Amielle.  I&#39;m surprised profanity bothers you that much, given what I&#39;ve heard.”  Mist added.<br />
<br />
“What -did- you hear?”  Toni spoke up, ready to defend her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Probably that she&#39;s the sluttiest Angel in Heaven.”  Gemory snickered.<br />
<br />
“Ah.  That&#39;s probably true.”  Amielle admitted.  “I mean, I wouldn&#39;t use the s-word, but...I&#39;m a sex maniac.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s the Second Raphaelite Mandate for you.  You were a virgin when you got to Heaven.”  Mist nodded.<br />
<br />
“What does that have to do with it?”  Toni was puzzled.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s like this.  Angels can&#39;t be made out of just any old soul.  Even if you get to Heaven, you might lack the essential purity.  So it was decided new Angels can only be made out of young souls, who have only had one life, and were still innocent when they died.  Like small children or developmentally disabled people.  There as a mix-up...probably Hell&#39;s doing...and somebody confused &#39;innocent&#39; with &#39;virgin&#39;.” Mist explained.<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t say you&#39;re wrong about that, we do love to try and sabotage Heaven when we can, but I wasn&#39;t involved, and nobody has ever claimed to be responsible.  We&#39;re still amused that all Angels have to be girls!”  Gemory grinned. <br />
<br />
Mist stuck out her tongue like a little girl.  “Jokes on you, I chose to be female on my own.”<br />
<br />
“Well I can&#39;t say you chose wrong, you&#39;re a hot Amazon babe.”  Gemory waggled her eyebrows at Mist.<br />
<br />
“Forget it, I don&#39;t have sex with Devils.  No offense, Amielle.”<br />
<br />
“None taken, Mist.  They&#39;re a bit spicy, so it&#39;s an acquired taste.”  Amielle said, cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“Spicy?  How am I spicy?”  Toni blinked.<br />
<br />
“Well, Angel pussy is like milk and honey.  Demon pussy is more like...mmm...Fireball.”  Ami grinned.<br />
<br />
“I have no words.”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“Just be happy your girlfriend likes cinnamon whiskey?”  Gemory grinned.  “Ok, where was I...oh right.  Michael.  So Mike, he goes up the chain of command, asking how long we were going to let Lucifer do whatever the fuck he wanted.  And eventually, he has an audience with Sandalphon who was like, &#39;well, I told them to stop&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;And?&#39; Michael asked- or so I&#39;m told.  I wasn&#39;t there!  But even though he&#39;s really slow to get annoyed, once he gets there, Mikey is a hothead and gets pretty grumpy.<br />
<br />
&#39;And...that&#39;s it.  I can&#39;t force him to get in line.&#39;  I know I&#39;m not doing Sandy any justice here, but I mean, he handled this really poorly.<br />
<br />
So Mikey went to his workshop and had a think.  Even though he was a repair guy, not an engineer or an architect, Mikey is really strong, like, stupidly strong for an Archangel.  Necessary for his work, but surprising to anyone who has ever witnessed what he can do when he puts his mind to something.  And not only is he strong, he has a great talent for problem solving.  So he was like, ok, how to stop an Angel.  I mean, they can&#39;t be hurt by much, and they only have a few weaknesses.  So he looked about the place, and figured out what tools could actually -hurt- an Angel.<br />
<br />
Now, I just want to say, I feel bad for Mikey.  He was put in a situation that never should have happened.  And he was just following his nature.  I know for a fact that what he did, to end the Rebellion, just killed him inside.  But it&#39;s like what I said about how we have the capacity for emotion.  Michael was probably the first Angel to feel guilt.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever gotten over it.”<br />
<br />
“He has not.”  Amielle said.  “He stays in his workshop all day, unless something breaks.  He barely speaks, and he...he mopes.  It&#39;s really sad.  I wanted to go cheer him up, but everyone told me to stay away.”<br />
<br />
“Oh I bet I know what you planned on doing.”  Gemory chuckled.<br />
<br />
Ami blushed.  “Well, I mean, everyone says he has a giant cock.”<br />
<br />
Toni glared at her girlfriend, and Ami looked sheepish.  <br />
<br />
“I can attest to that, I&#39;ve seen it!”  Gemory laughed.  “Uh, I guess I skipped a bit.  So after seeing Adam and Eve have sex, some of us Angels tried it, and found we rather liked it.  So it spread throughout Heaven like wildfire.  I know that now, everyone up there are prudes about it, but this was before God let humans in, and way before humans started to get funny ideas about sex and monogamy.  I don&#39;t know how that got started- God said &#39;be fruitful and multiply&#39;.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can answer that.  The Succubi were too good at their jobs.  So someone got the bright idea that maybe we should convince humans to avoid men and women of &#39;loose character&#39;.  Huge backfire, since it just led to sexually repressed idiots who only screw behind closed doors, and can&#39;t even figure out how to talk to the opposite sex.”  Mist chimed in.<br />
<br />
Toni raised her hand.  “I was one of those.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t remember it, but I probably was too.”  Amielle admitted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it was a dumb mistake, and most of the big religions, rather than admit it was a dumb idea, have just doubled down on it.” Mist shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Hell, it made our job easier, in the long run.  Oh sure, people would denounce a Succubi or Incubi in public, but get them behind closed doors?  Humans are FREAKS!”  Toni grinned.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s the difference anyways?  I mean, aren&#39;t Incubi just dudes?”  Amielle asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, technically, there is no difference.  Most Succubi can change shape to appear more appealing to their target, and they can be male, female, neither, or both, to best do their jobs.”  Gemory explained.<br />
<br />
“So Toni can turn into a boy?”  Amielle&#39;s eyes got big.  “I thought you said you couldn&#39;t!”<br />
<br />
Toni held up her hands.  “I can&#39;t!  Gemory made me that way!”<br />
<br />
Ami gave Gemory a look.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t stare at me like that!  You didn&#39;t now Toni when she was a mortal.  Sexually-repressed idiot is being kind.  Once I found out what her type was, ie, tiny ass loli with big tits, I turned her into one, so she&#39;d learn to be smarter.”  Gemory frowned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was pretty dumb.  Gemory broke my neck and dragged me down to Hell, instead of giving me my wishes.  But!  Before you yell at her, I can honestly say, she&#39;s still the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me!”  Toni exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s true, in only ten years, she&#39;s become one of my top pay earners.” The Demon nodded.<br />
<br />
“So...I&#39;m not your type?”  Ami pouted.<br />
<br />
“Uh, well, that&#39;s when I was young and stupid!  I&#39;ve learned there&#39;s more important things than a pair of big breasts!”  Toni was suddenly on the spot.<br />
<br />
“Oh?  Like what?”<br />
<br />
“Someone who is kind, gentle, affectionate, loving, and wild in bed.  As pretty as you are...and you are perfect, my Angel...that&#39;s just the icing on the cake.”  <br />
<br />
Ami glomped onto her tiny lover.  “Oh Toni, you&#39;re such a good girl!” She then showered her girlfriend with kisses.  “But you did like it when I shrank?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...very much so.”  Toni said, dazed and blushing.  <br />
<br />
“Then I&#39;ll have to do it again, as your reward.”  Ami nodded.<br />
<br />
“Hey, how small can you get?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m an Angel, I can dance on the head of a pin, why?”  <br />
<br />
Toni whispered something to her lover.<br />
<br />
Ami looked shocked, then she blushed, then she got a sly smile.  “Yes, I&#39;d be happy to do that.”<br />
<br />
Mist raised an eyebrow.  “Do I want to know?”<br />
<br />
“Probably not.”  Gemory replied.  “Anyways, I always planned on giving Toni full Succubus powers eventually.  I&#39;m just constantly amazed at how much she gets done without having them.”<br />
<br />
Toni grinned.  “I enjoy a challenge.”<br />
<br />
“Gemory.  I know I don&#39;t have the right to ask this, and this is going to sound hypocritical...but I want a say in who I share my girl with.”  Ami said.<br />
<br />
“Ami...she -owns- me, you know that, right?”  Toni said, quietly.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  I&#39;ll tell you what, Amielle.  I&#39;ll sell her to you.” <br />
<br />
“Done!”  Amielle stuck out her hand to Gemory.<br />
<br />
“AMI!!  You didn&#39;t even ask the price!”  Toni yelped.<br />
<br />
Gemory grabbed Ami&#39;s hand and shook it.  “Deal!  You all witnessed it!”<br />
<br />
Ami looked at her hand, and shrugged.  “I don&#39;t care.  You&#39;re worth it, Toni.”<br />
<br />
“But love...she can ask you do to -anything-!  You&#39;re basically her slave now!”  Toni wailed.<br />
<br />
Ami looked to Toni.  “Maybe so, but now you are -mine-.”<br />
<br />
Toni blushed, looking both happy and uncomfortable at the same time.  “Yes, Mistress.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, Toni.  I&#39;m not going to force her to be a prostitute, even if I think she&#39;d look great in short black leather.  Plus we still have to find out what the fallout is going to be for all this.  So this is a good thing for you both- if Ami Falls, I have to take her in.”  Gemory explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  But does this mean I have to move out?”  The Succubus seemed unsure of herself.<br />
<br />
“Of course not.  My Palace is your home as long as you want to stay.  I created you, I&#39;m not going to kick you to the curb.  In a way, you&#39;re like a daughter to me.”  <br />
<br />
Toni&#39;s eyes got big and wide, and she launched herself at Gemory.  “Can I call you Mom?”<br />
<br />
Gemory hugged the tiny Succubus.  “You idiot, we&#39;ve had sex how many times?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but, we&#39;re -Demons-!  Oedipus banging his Mom wouldn&#39;t even make someone in Hell bat an eye!”<br />
<br />
“Well that, and Jocasta was a total HMILF.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“I assume that means what I think it does?” Mist gave Gemory an arch look.<br />
<br />
“Aw, you&#39;re an HMILF too, Misty!”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ugh.  Stop, I&#39;m not interested.”  Mist held up a hand.<br />
<br />
“I guess I should finish my story.  So Mikey, once he realized what he could do, naturally improved on the idea, and created the very first weapons.  Not only did he create the ancestor of the sword, he did it one better.”  Gemory shuddered at the memory.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it was on fire?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“Worse.  It was radioactive.”  Said Mist.<br />
<br />
“Eww!”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Mikey figured out how to make a superstrong alloy that could be worked like steel, and made Hiroshima look like a warm spring day.  Now, Angels are normally fine dealing with radiation- Angels of Death like Misty here can nuke cities if they have to.”<br />
<br />
“Not that I&#39;ve ever had to.  And the ones that have...aren&#39;t the same after.”  Mist frowned.<br />
<br />
“But it turns out, if you stab one with a radioactive sword, that doesn&#39;t feel so hot.”  Gemory wrapped her arms around her torso.  “So Mikey made a bunch of these, and rolled up on us saying we need to stop being bitches and get back to work, or he&#39;d fuck us up.”  She shook her head.<br />
<br />
“We called his bluff.  Angels were never meant to be hurt.  Never meant to fight like that.  So...it turns out, we were never meant to -heal- either.  I mean, eventually we did, but either because our bodies didn&#39;t know how, or some result of the radioactivity...it took a long time.  And Lucifer, despite taking on that dragon form he was so proud of, was shocked to find out Michael was just as physically strong as he was.  After all, just because Lucifer was the best at everything didn&#39;t mean someone else couldn&#39;t be just as good as he was.  Plus Mikey had trained to use his weapon, and Lucifer...had never fought anything in his damn life.<br />
<br />
So in the end, we were all beaten, but Luci didn&#39;t give up.  &#39;We&#39;ll never stop!  Do you hear me!  Never!  This won&#39;t end here!&#39;.  And, well, while some were seriously rethinking this whole Rebellion thing, the ones who were closest to him...we weren&#39;t going to abandon him.<br />
<br />
So Michael said, &#39;fine, have it your way&#39;.  He cut off our wings and punted us out of Heaven.  There&#39;s a reason we&#39;re called Fallen.  We fell to Earth and, it hurt like nothing you can imagine.  The scars healed.  At least mine did.  And some of us grew our wings back.  But they usually came back wrong.  Black feathers like a crow, or batlike wings like Toni&#39;s.  Mine never did.  I don&#39;t fly anymore.”<br />
<br />
Gemory paused.  She wanted to cry so bad, but she needed to finish this.  Then she&#39;d go find Danielle.  “God came back.  Nobody knows what happened to Sophia, exactly.  She isn&#39;t gone, since humans did learn about her eventually, but she avoids God to this day.  As for Lilith, you run into her every so often.  Still beautiful.  Still immortal.  But the fire is gone.  That pride, that stubborness...gone.  <br />
<br />
Whatever went down, God was in a straight funk.  When hearing about the Rebellion, he made some new Angels to replace the ones that were lost.  He didn&#39;t punish anyone.  It&#39;s true he offered Mikey a promotion, but, well, you know how that went.  The great hero.  The Catholics even pray to him sometimes.  But he just went back to work.<br />
<br />
God went to the Garden, and saw his experiment was totally ruined.  So he opened the Gates, kicked Adam and a pregnant Eve out, and put an Angel to guard it.  Armed with one of those blazing swords.<br />
<br />
The Serpent, well, that one, God did punish.  Took away his ability to change form, and left him to exist, a Fallen Angel with the body of a snake.  He had to evolve into something that could walk about the hard way.  Even Demons avoid him, because he&#39;s a bitter, angry thing.<br />
<br />
And time moved on.  In the lands East of Eden, Adam and Eve encountered God&#39;s first attempts to create humans.  Some were really close, but weren&#39;t perfect.  Eve gave birth to twins- you know their story.  God was plenty disappointed in humans, and was a bit harsh with them, though no doubt, there was a lot of guilt, too.<br />
<br />
Adam and Eve had a nice big brood, and even interbred with their kids and grandkids.  They both lived to a ripe old age.  But the power of the Fruit of Life was fading, and each generation was less perfect than the one before it.  Caine interbred with what you&#39;d call Cro-Magnon peoples, and eventually, the two main branches of humanity became one lineage.  <br />
<br />
As for Lucifer, he established Hell- I guess it was an early prototype for Heaven that God left laying around, thinking there&#39;d be a use for it later.  We made it our home.  Now that Death was a thing, and God was not willing to let human souls into Heaven, Angels of Death were created and assigned to the job of gathering up souls and bringing them to the Lobby.  What people call Limbo.<br />
<br />
But once he got out of his own funk, at least, partially, Lucifer had a change of heart about humans.  He realized that it wasn&#39;t their fault.  They didn&#39;t ask to be made, any more than he had been.  So we started gathering souls as well.  There was a big fight about it, but God didn&#39;t want to get involved, so in the end, Sandy and Luci and some of the other top brass had a big pow-wow.  I was there, but I didn&#39;t get a vote.  <br />
<br />
The Compromise was agreed upon.  We&#39;d get the bad souls, the good...or good-ish ones went to Limbo.  Hell didn&#39;t have it&#39;s bad name just yet, heck, we didn&#39;t even torment the souls.  Just let them be.  It was during their meeting that Luci and Yahosua discussed what Heaven and Hell should be like.  Yahosua is one of the most chill guys you can ever meet.  I mean, he wasn&#39;t the peace-loving hippy the New Testament tries to paint him as- the guy was a radical left wing revolutionary, but he didn&#39;t want to use violence like the Zealots did.<br />
<br />
Change has to happen slowly, or it leads to more chaos.  And that&#39;s when Hell really started to change form.  Anyways, Yahosua died, ascended to Heaven, and opened the Gates for all the souls to come filtering in from Limbo.  Well, the ones that made the cut, that is.<br />
<br />
Some were sorted into Purgatory, a few were sent to us.  The ones that weren&#39;t quite good enough for Heaven, the Lost, were allowed to stay there.  It&#39;s only temporary of course, the fate of the vast majority of souls is to return in one form or another.  Though they don&#39;t have to.  Free Will, yadda yadda.”  Gemory trailed off, then sighed.  “Okay, storytime is over.  I need to be with my fiancee when she wakes up.  Thanks for the hospitality, Mist.”<br />
<br />
Mist simpy nodded.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I hope these rooms are soundproof.  I&#39;m pretty sure Dani is tuckered out, but these two are going to be at if for hours.”  Gemory indicated Ami and Toni.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry.  I&#39;ve had a few Angels show up here for a tryst from time to time.”  Mist shook her head, before assuming the shape of the older woman again.  “Have fun!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Gemory was surprised to find Danielle in the hall, seated on the floor with her back to the wall.  “Baby?”<br />
<br />
Dani looked up at her fiancee.  “Hey.  Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
Gemory sat down next to her beloved.  “Isn&#39;t that what I should be asking you?  Oh...you heard that?”<br />
<br />
Dani nodded. “I did.”<br />
<br />
“I could use a hug.”  Gemory admitted.<br />
<br />
Danielle pulled her lover into her lap and held her tightly.  “I&#39;m sorry.  I had no idea how sad your story was.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, I was a pretty bad girl.  Still am.  So ultimately, I probably deserved it.”<br />
<br />
“It still sucks.”  Dani buried her face in Gemory&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
“It does.  Hey, I have a question.”<br />
<br />
“What is it?”  Dani asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, two questions.  First...I was thinking about changing my hair color.  Any preference?”<br />
<br />
“I can pick anything I want?”  Dani smiled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Absolutely.”<br />
<br />
“I hate having long hair, it&#39;s a pain.  But if I had long hair, I always thought one of those tie-dye looks was great.  Like, platinum blonde that is turquoise at the ends?  Or is that lame?”  Dani frowned.<br />
<br />
Gemory kissed her lover.  “No, I think I&#39;ll try that out in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“What was the other question?”  Dani asked.<br />
<br />
“Can I have that spanking now?”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
Danielle laughed.  “Oh yes.  You&#39;ve been a very bad little demon, haven&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
Gemory giggled as they made their way to their room.</p>
