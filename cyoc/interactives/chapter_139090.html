<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cold water dowsing her, she shuddered and closed her eyes, struggling to ignore the weight of her penis and testicles, and the way they slapped against her legs every so often. Lowing sightly, she thought, &quot;Can&#39;t get horny. Get get myself off. It&#39;ll just, moouuu, make it worse,&quot; she leaned forward in an attempt to keep from feeling it touch her.<br />
<br />
The weight the most noticeable, Chastity wondered how she could take her mind off it. Reaching up, she began running her hands through her hair, but stopped when she felt something thick near the edge of her forehead. Thinking, &quot;Great. Moouuu. Now what,&quot; she used her hands to study what she concluded where two, small, hard nubs that came to a point. Shuddered at the idea that she was developing some other freak appendage, she lowed out, &quot;Moouuu,&quot; and butted her head against the wall, wondering what she&#39;d done to deserve being turned into some male freak.<br />
<br />
Not sure what she&#39;d done, sure she hadn&#39;t done anything, she twisted her head one way, then another as she felt a weight growing more and more prominent. Disturbed, she opened her eyes and was about to investigate the nubs when she noticed the hair circling the drain. Screaming, she reached up and ran a hand over her head and feeling a short frizz, she began to low out, &quot;No, no, no, noooo-moouuu,&quot; unaware with how her words were slowly shifting from English to bovine. Reaching out to shut off the water, she quickly climbed out of the tub, stumbled and immediately cracked her head against the wall, lowing out in panic as it happened.<br />
<br />
Only, to her surprise, it didn&#39;t hurt and instead she heard a sharp, &quot;Crunch,&quot; and trying to look in the direction of the sound, Chastity found she had difficult turning her head as it seemed to be caught in the wall. Alarmed, she screamed out, &quot;Moouuu,&quot; and violently jerked back, ripping a fair sized hole in the wall. Screaming out, &quot;Great. Just moouuu great,&quot; she turned away and stomped over the to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Hesitant to look at herself, it was her desire to know what the nubs on her forehead were that finally convinced her to peer into the reflective surface. Finding a stranger&#39;s face gazing back at her, she lowed out in fright as she first touched what she could clearly see where a pair of horns, still growing, then ran her hair through the remains of her hair, which was now buzz short and cream coloured. Rumbling out, &quot;I&#39;m a freak. A moouuu freak,&quot; she began to weep as she realised that, with how her face looked, she could no longer think of herself as a girl. Turning away from the mirror, still weeping, she stumbled across the bathroom, violently yanked the door open, and nearly ripped it off the hinges, and stomping out into the hall, she headed for her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, she started to sit down on the bed, but remembering what had happened the last time, she paused and after a moment, decided that she needed to find something to wear. But the problem, she noted, was that everything of her likely wouldn&#39;t fit. Walking heavily over to her dresser, she opened the drawer with her underwear, but immediately closed it afterward, knowing already the tiny little panties she loved to wear wouldn&#39;t fit. Considering a skirt or a dress, she glanced down at her large male frame, thought it looked like it was getting bigger, and decided against a dress or skirt, scared about what might happen if she became aroused. Opening a couple other drawers, she pawed through the clothing and after a bit chose a pair of black, Hello Kitty leggings, the only clean pair of leggings she had, as all her others, and her sweats, were in the laundry.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d pulled on the cotton stretch pants, Chasity peered down at herself and immediately lowed out, &quot;I look moouuu ridiculous,&quot; as she took in how leggings pulled tight, displaying fully the two foot long penis she had stuffed down one legs, and the large testicles that she hadn&#39;t been able to figure out what to do and had, in the end, let them slip between her legs. Sitting down on her bed, she pulled on the ends of the legs, trying to get them to come down past her knees, but when it was clear they wouldn&#39;t stretch that far, she gave up and instead contented herself with trying to find a comfortable way to sit as she tried to figure out a way to stop what was happening.<br />
<br />
As she sat on the bed, she occasionally lowed out and tossed her head. The weight of her horns, while she was slowly getting used to them, still bothered her. Settling so that her legs were spread as far as possible, she found herself drawing a blank on how to stop whatever was happening to her. Her feet starting to itch, she absently scratched them as she asked herself whether something similar was happening to Bets, Diane and April, and whether any of them would believe her is she tried to contact them.<br />
<br />
Her feet starting to itch more, she huffed in agitation and flopped back. Staring up at the ceiling, trying to ignore the feeling of her penis and testicles, the sensation of her horns and the irritation that was her feet, she was unaware that it was more than a simple itch as her feet began to morph into a set of cloven hooves. Reaching up to run a hand over her horns, Chastity noted the there was now hair around them and lowing out in vexation, she suddenly decided that, no matter what, she wanted to speak with one of her friends. Thinking about which one, Chastity decided to call April. Opening her eyes, unsure when she closed them, she gasped when she saw it was almost dark out and upset by how late it was and that it looked like she wouldn&#39;t be hanging out with her friends, she heaved herself up and off the bed, which she noted now looked bowed down in the middle from her weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t be helped. At least, not at the moment,&quot; she thought as she stepped back across the room, missing that her feet were no longer human.<br />
<br />
Outside in the hall, she tromped toward the kitchen and picking up the phone, receiver, she had started to dial April&#39;s number, when she realised that she didn&#39;t know what to say. Figuring, &quot;Help. I&#39;ve been cursed,&quot; wouldn&#39;t go over to well, she ruminated on what to say, then began to dial. An itching sensation starting in her hands, Chastity moaned in discomfort as a fluttery feeling began in her stomach. Trying to ignore both, she listened as the phone rang, the went silent. Hoping April had picked up, Chastity was about to start speaking when she heard the answering machine telling her to leave her name, number and her message and that someone would get back to her as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Disgruntled by this, Chastity lowed silently in frustration and when she heard the beep, she froze for a minute. Then, without giving much thought to what she was saying, she spoke out in a deep baritone, &quot;I know this probably, moouuu, doesn&#39;t like like me. But April you got moouuu me. It&#39;s moouuu Chastity. Some-moouuu is moouuu to moouuu-eee and I need your moouuu. I&#39;m moouuu and moouuu and I don&#39;t know what to moouuu. Please-moouuu. You&#39;ve got to moouuu. I moouuu I&#39;m moouuu, moouuu, moouuu...&quot;<br />
<br />
But, before she could finish, the phone suddenly dropped from her hands as the itching feeling suddenly grow worse and she found she could no longer hold the receiver. Terrified, she lowed out, &quot;Nooo-moouuu, moouuu, moouuu, moouuu,&quot; as she watched her hands morph into a pair of cloven bull hooves. Unable to articulate any more in English, she lowed out as she stepped backward, staring in horror at what had become of her hands. Tossing her head, lowing out more and more, she turned and stumbled across the kitchen. Feeling like she needed to get some some sort of help, her digestive tract finishing it transformation to a ruminant digestive system, Chasity ploughed across the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Somehow managing to get the kitchen door open, which she thought might be in part due to the fact that she had closed it properly before, she stumbled outside. Breathing deeply the night air, she screamed out, Somebody helped me,&quot; but instead of words, all that came out was a series of moouuu. Tripping down the back steps, she lost her footing on the last step and pitching forward, she thrust out her front hooves to catch herself. The instant her hooves touched the ground, her body realigned to a quadruped form with an audible and painful crack. Trying, and failing, to stand up, Chasity lowed out in despair. Feeling something painful poking into the back of her leggings, which were now pulled so tight they were almost coming apart at the seams, she was overcome with an odd sensation that she struggled to describe before concluding it was what was certainly her humanity slipping away and the bull she almost was start to take over.</p>
