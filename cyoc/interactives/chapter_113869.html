<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Regina woke up feeling cold; unused to the sensation even when in her Fursona; the were-lioness rolls over on the bed to find her husband’s side empty and unslept in.<br />
“You spent the night at the hospital,” Regina sighing to no one in particular; “didn’t you Leon.”<br />
<br />
Getting out of bed, her digitigrade paws making contact with the carpeted floor; stretching and flexing, Regina digs her claws into the carpet as she woke up. Swiveling her ears about, she listens for sounds of anyone up. Regina knew her daughter Jean and her werewolf mate Nate were over; she heard them rutting well past midnight and into early Sunday morning.<br />
“At least Jean is safe and sound,” Regina putting on a robe and heading downstairs; “I don’t know what I would do if something bad happened to my precious daughter.”<br />
 <br />
Pausing to press an ear to Jean’s bed room door; Regina listens quietly to the sounds of two weres snoring peacefully. Not one to be a snoop, Regina felt the need to make sure the two were alright. Even though her husband has arraigned security to keep an eye on his family and property; Regina felt ill at ease. With a mobster running around town and his son in jail after nearly killing Peter, her oldest son and future king of the were-lion pride. Regina was in no mood for surprises; so when she entered her kitchen to see her nephew Eugene just starting to fry some bacon on a skillet, Regina instinctively bared her claws and fangs as she started to growl at the man wearing an apron.<br />
<br />
“Is that any way to great your nephew,” Eugene looking at the angry were-lioness; “with growls and snarls?”<br />
It took Regina a moment to realize her mistake before calming down. Sitting in a chair at the kitchen table; she listens to the sound of the bacon starting to sizzle as her nephew sits down to join her.<br />
“I’m sorry Eugene,” Regina sighing; “I had a fight with Leon last night and I’m feeling on edge. But what are you doing back in town?”<br />
“Helping family,” Eugene placing his hand on his aunt’s large tawny furred paw; “plus it’s Sunday and I’m off duty until Tuesday. What better place than to enjoy my time off but with family?”<br />
“Well you are definitely a welcome sight to these eyes,” Regina smiling; “but you better flip that bacon. I can smell it’s starting to burn.”<br />
“King uncle always likes his bacon extra crispy,” Eugene getting up; “I figured it would be a nice smell for him to wake up to.”<br />
“Leon isn’t here,” Regina answering; “he hasn’t left Peter’s side.”<br />
“So he is still at the hospital,” Eugene looking thoughtful; “I guess that makes sense, king uncle wants to make sure Peter pulls through. So who else is here? Other than my assorted cousins and uncles milling about the property?”<br />
“Jean is upstairs,” Regina answering; “sleeping soundly with her mate.”<br />
“Ahh,” Eugene chuckling; “guess I’ll need to put more bacon on the skillet then.”<br />
“Don’t forget your assorted cousins and uncles,” Regina getting up; “it would be rude to deny them a breakfast of greasy eggs and bacon.”<br />
“I’ll get the coffee going then,” Eugene chuckling; “you deal with the greasy feast.”<br />
“Just like you,” Regina shaking her head; “to do the easy job.”<br />
“Last I checked,” Eugene rolling his eyes; “being a state trooper is far more difficult than replacing a cracked cylinder in a V8 engine with fuel injection.”<br />
“If I recall you couldn’t even do that,” Regina chuckling; “let alone replacing a flat tire.”<br />
“Oh please,” Eugene laughing; “if I couldn’t replace a flat, I would be next to useless as a state trooper. I can do that at least,” Eugene smiling as he pours himself a fresh cup of coffee; “it’s changing the oil that’s difficult for me, and messy.”<br />
“Go serve coffee to the men Leon assigned to watch over the place,” Regina laughing; “and let them know there will be some breakfast for them in about an hour.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Meanwhile upstairs, the smell of bacon hits the noses of the sleeping couple. Nate the first to react, his lupine nose drinking in the inviting smell of cooking pork as he growls happily; waking up to see he was still spooning Jean, well after the two passed out after their nightly coupling. Nate feels the were-lioness he is embracing stir as she too rumbles; the smell of cooking bacon hitting her nose, her tail twitching in response.<br />
“Smells like you mother has started making breakfast,” Nate giving Jean a playful lick; “lots of it too.”<br />
“I think she is cooking breakfast for my uncles and cousins as well,” Jean yawning; “you had to have picked up their scents last night when we arrived last night.”<br />
“Yeah,” Nate letting go of Jean as he gets up; “you think they know we are an item?”<br />
“I’m sure they heard us last night,” Jean purring; “it’s hard not to hear a lion and wolf roaring and growling in unison.”<br />
“You know,” Nate looking at his were-lioness mate stretch and flex; getting a good long look at her voluptuous figure and feeling a stirring in his loins; “if it wasn’t for the fact that I have some yard work jobs to do today, I’d be spending the entire day keeping your furry body next to mine.”<br />
“We could do that tomorrow,” Jean eyeing her mate’s lupine shaft peeking out of its sheath; “as much as I want to go to the labor day picnic, I’m not liking the fact that I can’t be in my fursona during the event.”<br />
“I am curious about this,” Nate watching Jean lick her lips as she eyes his ruby red shaft now at full mast; “why is this labor day picnic such a big deal here?”<br />
“It’s the one day in the year in which we can be in our fursona’s during the day,” Jean now inches from Nate’s shaft a giving it a lick or two; “think of it as Christmas in the summer as we all get together at the lake and enjoy a pot luck feast.”<br />
“Do we exchange presents,” Nate growling as he watches Jean start to suck on his shaft; her tongue dancing around it causing him to moan as he feels his legs quiver and shake from the intense sensation.<br />
<br />
Jean doesn’t answer as she works Nate’s shaft with ruthless efficiency. Hearing Nate moan and growl as he collapses one the bed; effortlessly following as she feels Nate’s paws on the back of her head, ensuring that she doesn’t try to pull out. Jean just growls as she swallows the entire length of the werewolf penis in her maw; massaging the length with her rough tongue as she sucks it; Jean is soon rewarded as Nate lets off a low howl as she feels his warm salty seed blast and splash in her mouth. Resisting the urge to gag as she lets the seed trickle down her gullet; Jean hold onto a vast majority of Nate’s fluids as she lets his still spurting member out of her mouth and approaches his muzzle and kisses him. Their tongues dancing in each others mouths as best they can; their muzzles ill-suited to kissing like they could in their human forms. Letting his seed spill into his mouth; Jean purrs as she can feel Nate grab her closer to his body. Watching him swallow as she looks into his wolfish eyes; seeing nothing but love in those lupine orbs staring back at her.<br />
<br />
“Now how about we get some breakfast in us,” Jean purring; “you don’t want to be cutting grass on an empty stomach now do you?”<br />
“All right,” Nate letting Jean go; “lead on my horny mate. But you still need to explain to me more about this picnic you want to ditch.”</p>
