<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Note: This is a continuation of the last chapter, with some changes made to follow the rules of the medallion more closely.)<br />
<br />
Ryan stared at himself in the mirror in awe. He couldn&#39;t believe that the face of the chubby, older woman in the mirror was his own. The medallion worked, and it had turned him into the owner of the scarf, his co-worker, Anne. &quot;Wow,&quot; he said softly. &quot;It&#39;s real.&quot; He immediately started to examine the rest of his body. He cupped his new breasts, lifting them up and down a bit. They were large and weighty, but they showed Anne&#39;s age by sagging a bit, resting on his chubby belly. He removed his tie and unbuttoned his shirt, revealing them to the mirror. He chuckled, and placed his hands over his nipples. They were a bit more sensitive than his old ones, and it gave him a slight chill down his spine. He didn&#39;t have a bra to hold them up. He didn&#39;t have any of Anne&#39;s clothes besides the scarf, for that matter.<br />
<br />
He redid the buttons and decided to check below. He unbuckled his belt and dropped his pants. He lowered his boxers and tried to get a good look at his new equipment, struggling to see underneath his gut. He wondered how difficult it would be to learn how to use it. He sat down on the toilet, relaxed, and, to his surprise, was able to go. He giggled a bit. It was such a mundane thing, but it was a completely alien experience to him. Imagine all the small differences he missed out on not having grown up as a girl.<br />
<br />
Ryan put his clothes back on and looked back in the mirror. He realized that his old clothes fit him rather poorly, and it made him look strange. He had lost several inches in height, so everything around him seemed a bit bigger. His shirt was fairly loose on him and his pants were a bit too long. His feet had also shrunk, which meant that his shoes didn&#39;t fit as well as they used to. He fiddled with his clothes, tightening his shoelaces, rolling up his pant legs, and tucking in his shirt. He looked better, but not really normal. His clothing still looked ill-fitting, and Anne didn&#39;t wear anything like this around the office. She usually wore blouses and skirts. He would need to get his hands on some women&#39;s clothing somehow.<br />
<br />
Looking at the clock on the wall of the bathroom, Ryan realized that it was 10AM. He remembered what he read about the rules of the medallion: No changes until 12 hours pass. He would have to wait until tonight if he wanted to change back to his old form. &quot;Wait,&quot; Ryan thought. &quot;I can&#39;t stay here. If Anne sees me, she&#39;ll probably freak out. And people might get suspicious if they see two Annes running around in different outfits.&quot; He needed to get out of the office. He put the scarf and medallion back into his bag. He didn&#39;t want to wear the medallion and have people asking questions about it.<br />
<br />
Ryan slowly opened the door to the bathroom and looked around to make sure the coast was clear. He made a mad dash to his cubicle, keeping his head down as he passed the cubicle partitions. It was a little easier to scoot by unnoticed thanks to his new height. He reached his desk. &quot;How do I make it so that people aren&#39;t wondering why Ryan isn&#39;t here?&quot; He decided to write a note, saying that a family emergency had come up. He&#39;d use some of his sick days to get away with this. He grabbed a post-it note and started writing, but stopped suddenly after writing a few words. His handwriting was different. He was writing in Anne&#39;s handwriting. Her body must still have her muscle memory, which means that he can&#39;t write in his own handwriting. He crumpled up the note and threw it away, opting to just email his boss when he gets home.<br />
<br />
Ryan opened his bag and pulled out his pair of sunglasses, hoping it would hide his identity just a bit. He grabbed his bag and headed for the exit farthest away from Anne&#39;s desk. He made it to the elevator, down to the ground floor, and started walking to the parking garage where his car was. He felt out of breath. Being an out of shape, 50-year old woman wasn&#39;t exactly great for walking quickly. He did enjoy his new ass swaying from side-to-side as he walked. Eventually, he made it to his car. He sat down, put his bag in the passenger seat, and then looked in the rear-view mirror at his face. He still couldn&#39;t believe that this was happening. He started his car and drove out of the parking garage, swiping his ID card to get out. He realized that both his ID card and driver&#39;s license still showed his old identity. He would need to find some kind of workaround for that. He was a bit worried that the garage&#39;s security cameras might have caught Anne driving off in Ryan&#39;s car, but he figured that there wouldn&#39;t be a reason for them to check the cameras anyway.<br />
<br />
Leaving the garage, Ryan thought about what to do next. He could go shopping for clothes, or maybe try to borrow some from someone. He thought about all the fun he could have with this new body. He realized that he could experience sex as a woman. He remembered the medallion&#39;s rules that, if he was on his period or pregnant, then he wouldn&#39;t be able to change back until it was over. He figured that, thankfully, Anne was likely well into menopause, so he didn&#39;t need to worry about either of those things. He felt a strange pride that he was in a body that had given birth several times in the past, though. He decided to go home to his apartment until he decided what to do next.</p>
