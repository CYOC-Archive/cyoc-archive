<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What are we doing here Darren,&quot; Pam asked. Darren had no answer, whatever had happened he had no answer. The only thing the teen did know was that something had changed. &quot;Steph,&quot; he called. &quot;Can you access city records? Find out what happened to Miss Yuriko?<br />
<br />
Steph, nodded, she hadn&#39;t done that before but it was within the Soul Drives abilities. Darren and the others watched as the wolf gynoids eyes seemednto flash, an odd expression crossing her face as she reviewed the information. &quot;That doesn&#39;t make any sense,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Steph?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; Steph said slowly. &quot;According to city records Miss Yuriko never owned this home. In fact, I can&#39;t find anything on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What how,&quot; Darren asked. &quot;Did we travel into the past? The future?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No its the same year,&quot; Steph said softly. &quot;But, it&#39;s like Yuriko...never existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren gawked, what could have happened to erase Yuriko from city records. &quot;Darren what&#39;s going on,&quot; Gail asked nervously. &quot;Nothing about this makes any sense.&quot; The others nodded, everything was proving to be confusing. How had Yurikos home fallen into such disrepair and where was she? As the teens now discussed what could have happened, Steph noticed a trio of Soul Drives now begin to approach. &quot;Hannah look,&quot; the Soul Drive called, pointing to the approaching Soul Drives. &quot;Maybe they could help.&quot; Waving at the approaching Soul Drives, the two gynoids offered polite smiles as walked towards them. &quot;Hi girls,&quot; Steph said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; the lead Soul Drive replied. &quot;What can I help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just talking with our friends,&quot; Hannah stated. &quot;Was curious what was going on with this house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This old place,&quot; a blue cat Soul Drive replied. &quot;It&#39;s been abandoned for close to what? Twenty? Thirty years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever since Mr. Aberforth passed away,&quot; a red canine Soul Drive shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m surprised the town hasn&#39;t demolished it.&quot; Hannah and Steph now looked between the Soul Drives and the home, how had the home been abandoned for so long? &quot;Hey Ginger, Aqua, check it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph and Hannah watched as a silver wolf Soul Drive now motioned towards their friends, there fellow Soul Drives frowning as their eyes locked on Raiden and Sachiko. &quot;What are you two doing with a pair of UnNormals,&quot; the silver wolf asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;UnNormals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the law,&quot; the Soul Drive scowled. &quot;Any UnNormal are to be turned over immediately for termination. Step back and we won&#39;t report this, unless you two want to risk deactivation.&quot; Steoh and Hannah gawked, shocked to hear Soul Drives speak like this. As they looked to answer, the trio of Soul Drives pushed them aside as they stomped towards Darren and the others. &quot;Hey you kids!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren paused, casting the trio of Soul Drives an odd look as they glared angrily at them. &quot;Um can I help you,&quot; he asked. The three Soul Drives now paused in front of Darren, glaring at the two kits who now nervously shifted under their gaze. &quot;What are you kids doing with a pair of UnNormal,&quot; they asked. &quot;Step aside so we can dispose of them.&quot; Raiden and Sachiko stepped back, the two kits frightened by the aggressive Soul Drives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what are you doing,&quot; Darren exclaimed, trying to step in between the Soul Drives and the frightened kits. &quot;Stop it,&quot; he called, the Soul Drivea continued to push forward, shoving Darren and his friends out of the way as they looked to grab the kits. Darren was beginning to grow angry, watching as his friends were roughly handled by the Soul Drives he himself had brought into existence. The teens eyes now began to glow, his anger and frustration rising to the surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said STOP!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s magic now lashed out, knocking the Soul Drives back. Stunned they now rebooted their systems, the teens watching as the trio of Soul Drives now locked eyes on Darren. &quot;Magic detected,&quot; they stated, their voices mechanical as they locked eyes with Darren. &quot;Eliminate magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren and the others eyes went wide as they watched the Soul Drives. Weapons now began to emerge from the gynoids, all trained on Darren. In his wildest dreams the teen had never thought of arming his creations like this. Now the very thing he had hoped to create a utopia was threatening to destroy him. Worse still, they could injure his friends in their quest to destroy him. Withdrawing the Dragons Tongue, the teen now weighed his options on how he could possibly get everyone to safety.<br />
<br />
A flash of light now startled the teens, Darren wondering what could possibly make things even worse. Much to his surprise he and the others watched as a massive werewolf now lept at the Soul Drives from behind them, firmly grasping the lead one in its mouth as it shook it like a ragdoll.<br />
<br />
The sound of metal being torn asunder, echoed through the area now, the werewolf tearing the Soul Drive in half as a middle aged woman rushed to assist. Darren surprised as she now cast a spell, crushing the second Soul Drive. Watching the woman, Darren could tell she wasn&#39;t a wizard, something felt different about her magic. Rushing towards the werewolf, he could now hear the woman trying to calm him as he flew into a rage.<br />
<br />
With only a single Soul Drive remaining, Darren watched as it now turned towards the werewolf and the woman. The teen had seen Soul Drives respond differently when confronted with violence and destruction, they naturally feared the ending of their own existence. These Soul Drives were different, the remaining Soul Drive showing little regard for the passing of its sisters as it trained it weapons on the woman. What occurred next told Darren that things were now drastically different.<br />
<br />
With a single sword swing, the teen watched as the Soul Drive was cut in two. As it collapsed into a lifeless heap of metal, Darren beheld a teenage kitsune, a white kitsune that he recognized but couldn&#39;t believe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia,&quot; the teenage Sachiko called. &quot;Get Zack under control.&quot; Mia grunted, useing her magic to now try and calm the almost rabid werewolf, Darren for the first time noting the scars and metal plates on the werewolves head and body. &quot;I&#39;m trying but you know how he gets,&quot; Mia replied. Mia now tried to calm Zack, useing her magic to calm the feral werewolf. Eventually, Zack seemed to calm, Mia now stroking his head as the werewolf whimpered.<br />
<br />
As the teenage Sachiko breathed a sigh of relief, she now turned, furrowing her brow as she glared at the teenager before her. &quot;Who are you,&quot; she growled. &quot;Whats a kid doing wielding magic out in the open?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren was dumbfounded, trying to stammer an answer. As the older Sachiko was about to speak, she paused as she now noticed the two kits standing behind Darren, gazing at her with frightened eyes. &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko what is it,&quot; Mia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its me,&quot; she replied, still dumbstruck to be viewing a childish version of herself. Shaking herself put of her stupor, she now turned once more to Mia. &quot;Mia we need a portal out of here now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachiko sighed, looking between the group of teens and her teammates. &quot;They&#39;re coming with us,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Fukushu is going to want to see this.&quot;</p>
