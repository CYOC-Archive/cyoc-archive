<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of Gloria’s day was thankfully quiet. Amazingly Miss Dean’s English class was enjoyable as she proved to be a very competent teacher. Gloria and her friends enjoyed it but what amazed Gloria the most was the fact that her friends no longer remembered the teenage Morgan. Morgan’s friends Bethany and Liz were now the tormentors of Gloria and her friends however they weren’t in many of the same classes as Gloria. This meant that the girls were left alone for most of the day.<br />
<br />
As Gloria entered her home she could see her parents sitting at the table enjoying a cup of coffee. “Hey sweetly how was school,” Jason asked. “Pretty good dad,” she said. Jason smiled as he now looked at his daughter. “Glad to hear it dinner should be ready soon so don’t fill up on junk food.”<br />
<br />
“Okay dad,” she answered. “Just need to make a quick call to Katie.” <br />
<br />
“Everything alright,” Lisa asked raising an eyebrow. Gloria nodded quickly as she looked at her stepmom. “Everything is fine mom,” she said quickly. “Just want to talk with her about something.” Lisa gave her step daughter a look of concern as she made her way upstairs. Although Lisa had an idea what she wanted to ask Katie about she realized it would be best to leave it between the girls. <br />
<br />
Gloria now stepped into her room, closing her door. Before Katie had left for college she had told Gloria she could contact her over Skype. As Gloria made her way towards her computer she now hoped Katie was home. Switching on her computer Gloria activated her Skype. “Cmon, Cmon,” she thought anxiously. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity Katie answered. Smiling the college girl smiled at her little sister. “Hey Gloria,” she said cheerfully. “Great to see you. Let me get Kellie she’ll be happy to talk with you too.”<br />
<br />
“Hi Katie,” she smiled. “Glad I caught you, I really need to talk with you, Kellie and Claudia.”<br />
<br />
Katie’s smile faded as she looked at Gloria. She had a feeling Gloria had some questions about the ring, hopefully nothing too bad had happened. “Okay,” she said. “Stay here for a sec, I’ll get them.” Gloria nodded as Katie vanished from sight. As she watched her screen she could hear Katie calling for both Kellie and Claudia. Although she could not make out what they were saying the tone sounded concerned. As the three college coeds made their way back to the screen Gloria  could see worried looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Katie said. “We’re all here so what’s up?”<br />
<br />
“Katie how many girlfriends do I hang out with,” Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
“Well theirs Jackie, Felicia and Diane,” she answered. “But I’m guessing that’s changed. Give us a quick sec okay.” Gloria nodded as she watched Katie, Kellie, and Claudia now touch the necklaces around their necks. As they did so Gloria watched as they seemed to gain knowledge of some of the changes she had made.<br />
<br />
“Okay so I see you have another friend...Sasha right,” Katie said as the information flooded her mind. Gloria nodded. “Yeah Sasha is a friend too.”<br />
<br />
The girls smirked as they looked at Gloria. “Okay well that’s nothing too bad,” Kellie said. “From what we can see she’s a good friend. Very loyal, very tough and you all seem to get along really well. Don’t worry too much about changing Mrs. Sampson. She’s been lonely since her husband passed away and wanted a fresh start. That change isn’t so bad.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded in amazement, surprised Katie and her friends had access to this much power. “Wow,” she gasped. “So those necklaces allow you to not only see what things were like before I made changes but can also see things now.”<br />
<br />
“I told you,” Katie smirked. “The necklaces allow us to see everything you’ve done with the ring. That way if things get too crazy we can help you change things back.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Gloria answered. “So my next question is what can you tell me about Morgan Dean and Claudia’s brother Derrick?”<br />
<br />
“Wait what’s going on with Derrick?” Claudia exclaimed, pushing Katie out of the way. <br />
<br />
Gloria now explained the situation with her old bully Morgan. She told how the girl had attempted to bully her in the bathroom before the ring turned her into a 4 year old girl. Gloria admitted how frightened she was and decided to transform her into a 25 year old teacher, just like Derrick. She now wanted to know how the two had known each other.<br />
<br />
Clauida rubbed her chin thoughtfully. “Good question,” she said. “Let me check the necklace.” Gloria watched as Claudia touched the necklace thoughtfully, trying to gain the information of Gloria’s latest transformation. As she did she begin to giggle. “Oh that’s too funny,” she smirked.<br />
<br />
“What,” Gloria exclaimed. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
“Turns out that Morgan was my brothers high school girlfriend,” she laughed. “In fact that was his first girlfriend. The two even went to prom together before they broke up and went to different colleges. They haven’t seen each other since but they always carried a torch for one another.”<br />
<br />
Gloria stared dumbfounded at her sister and her friend she who were now smiling broadly. “Sooo it’s nothing bad?” She said.<br />
<br />
“No,” Claudia said. “Derrick and Morgan are both single and they’re not both still head over heels for eachtother. Congratulations you just played matchmaker.”<br />
<br />
Gloria gaped at the girls who were now laughing. “So I did a good thing then,” she said thoughtfully. “I was scared something bad would happen. When the ring protected me from Morgan it freaked me out. I...Uh...didn’t want Morgan to be a kid but didn’t want her to be a bully anymore. Making her 25 seemed....well...natural.”<br />
<br />
“The ring does that,” Katie said. “We’ve found over the years that while you control the ring it guides your decisions.  Believe it or not it influence some decisions you make. That’s why Sasha is now you’re age and Morgan is Derricks. It kinda sees where things can be improved in people’s lives and makes it happen.”<br />
<br />
“So the ring controls me then,” Gloria said in alarm.<br />
<br />
“No not exactly,” Kellie answered. “The ring will only do what you ask it to do. It’s more like a guide, if you make a wish that wouldn’t work out well it tries to point you in a better direction.”<br />
<br />
“So that’s why Sasha is 14 not 17 and why Morgan is a teacher instead of back in preschool.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly Gloria,” Katie said. “See your doing fine.”<br />
<br />
Gloria exhaled in relief as shenanigans looked at Katie’s and her friends. “Well that makes me feel a bit better was worried I messed up.”<br />
<br />
“That’s only natural kiddo,” Kellie said warmly. “Trust us we went through the same thing when we were in high school with the he ring. Your doing fine just use your best judgement.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded, finally cracking a smile. “I will,” she said. “Claudia’s brother already told me to be very careful with it in school.”<br />
<br />
“That doofus,” Claudia snorted. “I told him to keep an eye on you not blab about it. Ugh I’m going to smack him when we come home for Thanksgiving.”<br />
<br />
The girls now began to giggle as Claudia angrily sent her brother a text message. “So anything else going on Gloria,” Katie asked. “School going okay? No other problems with the ring?”<br />
<br />
Gloria shook her head. “No everything else isn’t cool,” she said. “Really miss you guys though.”<br />
<br />
“We miss you too Gloria,” Katie said warmly. “You know you can Skype with us anytime or call if it’s  an emergency.”<br />
<br />
“I know Katie,” she smiled. “Hope everything I should going great up there. I should probably get going though. Dinner should be ready soon.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah we got to get dinner going soon too,” Kellie answered. “You take care now Gloria we’ll talk again soon.”<br />
<br />
“And tell my brother I said hi and not to give you too hard a time.”<br />
<br />
The girls now laughed as they said goodbye. Disconnecting Gloria leaned backwards in relief, happy to have someone she could talk with about the ring and happy her actions with it so far were for the best.</p>
