<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, Todd,&quot; said Carrie to the hamster sitting next to her on her bag. The hamster was nibbling on a sunflower seed she had given him.<br />
<br />
“Look at them,” she said.<br />
<br />
She pointed her remote at the three college girls sunbathing in their Bikinis. The brunette  girl in the middle had sat up on her elbows to flirt with a couple of young guys who were passing by her. The guys stopped to flirt with her. They seemed very interested but then walked off as if they were going to get something.<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled. An amusing idea had just come to her. She entered some settings into the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk, tsk. Just look at those girls.&quot; She said to her hamster. &quot;Don't they know that too much sunlight can age their skin?&quot;<br />
<br />
She pressed the execute button on the remote.<br />
<br />
Across the park the three girls felt a brief tingle. The blonde one on the left, whose name was Sandi, shifted uncomfortably for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Susy?&quot; said Sandi to the brunette girl next to her. &quot;Did you just feel something funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Susy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; said the third one, a shorter girl with dirty blonde hair named Nikki.<br />
<br />
Susy just readjusted herself and sighed, &quot;It was probably just the wind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two girls let it drop. They knew their place. Susy was the de facto leader of the group, seeing as she was the tallest, cutest and, with her C-cup breasts, the best endowed of all of them. Susy always got the cutest guys they met, and what Susy said was law to them. Still, Sandi and Nikki felt a little uneasy. It seemed to them that their Bikinis were feeling a little too tight on them, like they had shrunk suddenly.<br />
<br />
Although that had yet to realize it, the girls were rapidly growing older. They had all been 20 years old when they had started sunbathing. By this point, they were all entering their early 30s. Their cute youthful looks were fading away as their bodies matured. Their breasts, waists and hips had expanded some as their youthful physiques picked up some body fat with age. Nikki, the short one, had developed a serious tummy as well as child birthing hips and thunder thighs. Sandi was losing her muscle tone making her look flabby. Cellulite covered all of their thighs. Susy’s large breasts had swollen some then begun to sag, slumping towards the sides of her chest. The skin on all of their bodies was showing signs of sun damage. A smattering of sunburn freckles seemed to cover them all over. They looked less like college students and more like lonely housewives out for a day in the park. <br />
<br />
Susy wondered to herself when those two cute guys would come back with the ice cream she had asked them to get for her and her friends. “It was a pity that there were only two of them,” she thought. “But, Nikki is getting used to being looked over. Maybe they’ll have another less cute friend who would want her.” She looked forward to spending some time with the boys, her favorite hobby.<br />
<br />
The girls passed into their 40s. The first wrinkles began to form on their faces as they entered middle age. Nikki became even fatter. Despite being only, 5’2” she now weighed over 160 pounds. Her Bikini bit into her skin, but she kept quiet so as not to disturb Susy. She couldn’t stand being put down by Susy again for her little weight problem (a problem that was far from little now). Sandi was least affected by the ageing, but she still showed the signs of middle age on her. Her legs were being slowly covered in spider veins and her hair had faded from blonde to white. Susy’s breasts were huge and flattened out now.<br />
<br />
The two cute guys came back with ice cream cones in each hand. At first, they looked excited to see the hot chicks they had talked to before. Then, they took a closer look. Susy propped herself up again on her elbows to talk to them again. This time she looked as old as their mothers.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you guys,” she said. She looked confused a moment. Her voiced sounded froggier than usual.<br />
<br />
The guys looked at each other, surprised.<br />
<br />
“Um,” said one of them. “I think we must be in the wrong place.”<br />
<br />
The two guys walked away feeling confused. They tried to figure out if the girls they had talked to before were somewhere else in the park or if they had somehow mistaken those three old ladies for cute girls.<br />
<br />
Susy also looked confused. “Fuck them,” she said. “Who needs them?” She laid back down and comforted herself with the knowledge that she could get any man she wanted with her good looks. If she only knew how wrong she was…<br />
<br />
The girls flew through their 50s into their 60s. At this point, Nikki couldn’t help it any more, the pain was too great.<br />
<br />
“Ouch, this Bikini hurts,” she said and was surprised to hear the voice of an old lady instead of her own.<br />
<br />
All three girls sat up to look at her. What they saw was a chubby old woman with white hair wearing a tiny Bikini that seemed ready to snap off of her. They screamed. Hearing the old lady voices that came out of them, they looked at their own old bodies and screamed again. They all looked incredibly old, but the ageing continued. Wrinkles covered their once smooth skin all over. Age spots and varicose veins spread all over them. They felt older and more feeble every moment. All of their joints seemed to ache. Sandi just stared at her wrinkled, knobby arthritic hands. Susy noticed that even some of her teeth had disappeared and that her hair had gone gray.<br />
<br />
When all the girls had reached 75 years old, the changes stopped. Still screaming, they grabbed their blankets and attempted to cover up their old lady bodies. All the commotion they had caused began to draw a small crowd of people who stood around them trying to figure out just what it was that these old ladies were screaming about.<br />
<br />
Carrie sat on the bench chuckling to herself. She petted her little hamster.<br />
<br />
“See what I mean,” she said. “Sunlight can really age your skin.”<br />
<br />
