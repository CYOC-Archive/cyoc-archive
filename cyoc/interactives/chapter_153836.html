<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now THAT had felt good. Cody looked over his muscled build, taking in every note of his newfound physique. He had been terribly skinny until this device let him just skip the middle man and go right to the after picture. He took a step forward and flexed his leg, seeing the quad flex and make an incredible impression in his shorts. Cody could not help himself but laugh as he lightly slapped his leg muscle, loving it as much as he loved all other parts of his new buffed up body.<br />
<br />
But now that he thought about it, would it feel just as good to go even further? He took a glance back at the Chronivac. Maybe that&#39;d be good. He&#39;d seen some really buff guys on Instagram. And they were even bigger than him even now. Though... Cody thought about it, he already looked really good. What would amplifying his musculature and size even more do to him? What if he ended up---<br />
<br />
He cut himself off, and thought that no matter what happened, nothing could be as bad as being that skinny wuss he used to be. Nothing could be as bad as barely being able to lift the bar in the gym. He needed to further his advantage and really take this home. With that kind of mindset coming through to him, Cody fired up the Chronivac again.<br />
<br />
His build was already listed as buff, and he was looking forward to seeing what happened when he really got things going. Moving over to the weight, he took it up to 108.8 kg, which he guessed would put him at an even better weight. He would be bigger than even some of the Instagram guys and he would never have to look bad in front of girls or guys again. He made sure he was good to go and then engaged the Chronivac to start the transformation.<br />
<br />
The machine informed him that &quot;to acquire desired change, additional changes will need to be applied. Do you consent?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody didn&#39;t even bother thinking about it and clicked through that &quot;yes&quot;;<br />
<br />
He immediately felt a hot sensation come over him as his already bulky shoulders shredded the sides of his shirt, filling into huge boulder shoulders that required multiple XXL shirts and specialized uniforms besides if he went into any particular job. His back swelled and broadened, forming huge lats and rear delts, Cody&#39;s trapezius muscles swelling up the way a lot of those weightlifters had them. His arms continued bulking up, losing some slight tone but piling on the bulk and developing a huge 21 inch look, his triceps fighting and following the cue of his biceps.<br />
<br />
His chest outright ripped the front of his shirt as the pecs likewise demanded a specialized shirt design just to hold them in, and again it seemed he lost a slight amount of tone but gained substantial size. His abdomen filled in and his abs pushed out into a pronounced form, each abdominal looking thick and strong. His obliques almost looked etched in stone.<br />
<br />
Cody felt his legs get so thick he outright had to remove his shorts, the quads and thighs looking insane - the teardrop shaped quad and huge thigh made finding the right kind of jeans difficult, and even shorts were difficult for him. His glutes were huge, and pushed out the back enough to damage his already severely strained boxers. He chuckled...and noted his voice was deeper.<br />
<br />
And that his legs as buff as they were almost seemed longer by a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-My voice...?&quot; He hurried upstairs and checked out the mirror in the bathroom. In addition to the muscular changes, he noted he was looking more matured than usual. His face was more squared and macho, and he almost winced in recognition of a similar facial structure belonging to Jason, a high school senior who had been bullying him. So he looked kinda like Jason now...a high school senior. He was also taller - yeah, 6 foot 3 was incredibly fucking tall for the former wallflower.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I...it made me eighteen...wow...I turned into a stud at eighteen.&quot; He noted his crewcut in the reflection only made him more impressive looking. Really heightened his appealing features.<br />
<br />
Cody checked his phone, and noted there were some new things in there. Including reminders about homework, about the upcoming &quot;party at Jason&#39;s place&quot;, and some other things. &quot;Oh man, did this thing somehow make me that douchey bully&#39;s best friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked through the phone&#39;s gallery, and saw countless pictures of him and Jason smiling, laughing, interacting, eating pizza out, being bros together, hanging out at his place. Honestly, for Cody it was a side of Jason he&#39;d never gotten to know. He frowned a little. He wondered what to do...</p>
