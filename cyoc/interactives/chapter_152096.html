<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim awoke up and felt as if her whole body was soar, it was as if she had just gone through a whole work out. She was never the athletic and stopped playing sports outside of Gym class when she was in 5th grade and she was never good at it. As she woke it felt as if her whole body was soar, as she sat up in bed and blinked. Her cloths felt tighter and her bangs where covering some of her eyes. She pulled her hair out of her eyes and stopped, her hand was thinner more graceful. <br />
<br />
Her heart was racing as she moved to the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Oh…my…God.” Said Kim, her voice sounded smoother, it didn’t have the musical tone as her mentors and compared to them it was still rougher but the sound was smoother. Still that was nothing compared to changes of a single night. Her cloths felt tighter because they where, her top seamed ready to burst from the new additions to her chest and her but had also begun to take more of a form. Her hair was noticeable longer as well. She was also noticeably taller, she had always been short and plump like her mother but not now. Yes, she was still on the heavy side but what weight she did have was in very good places. <br />
<br />
“Take photo…” ordered Kim remembering the mirror was a smart mirror. The machine obeyed and it took a photo. “Measurements.”<br />
<br />
Kim held her breath as computer did its work. A boy had once told her that she would be lucky if she was considered a 4 out of 10 and would end up with an ugly man or a stupid man more then likely both. The comment and the others like it had helped beat her down, now however she would put herself at least a 7 if not an 8 out of 10 and it was only the first day.<br />
<br />
When it was done, the information came up, her weight had dropped almost 10 pounds, not as much as she thought but she had grown a good 3 inches, standing now just under 5’6 something. All the other Nympfs seamed tall as well, the shortest one being 5’10 and the tallest was over 6’4 so she would likely grow even taller. Her bust had gone up a cup size and her ass, well that was now well defined.  <br />
<br />
She pulled up the photo of herself from under 12 hours ago and began to notice other changes, her eyes where larger and seamed brighter, her neck longer and more elegant as well. And there was the skin, she knew some Nymphs like all monsters had gone through an ethnicity change but so far she hadn’t but old scars disappeared, a mole on her leg was gone as well and her skin just felt smoother. <br />
<br />
“Well I better get ready.” Said Kim still not fully believing that was her voice, she walked over to the dresser, her old cloths wouldn’t work for today. The center provided simple cloths for those changing, a plane color T-shirt and either shorts or pants nothing over the top and they where reused all the time. It didn’t matter to Kim, come tomorrow the top she was putting on now likely wouldn’t fit. She took off her sleeping top and bra only to stop, her breasts where bigger of course but they didn’t drop when down when she took off her bra. They had remained as perky as they had become even without a bra. As she hand touched her breast she gasped holding back a moan, they were a lot more sensitive then before. <br />
<br />
“Well they never say anything about that in the files.” Said Kim as she got dressed, putting on a bra anyway out of habit and then sat down to call her mother before going to bed.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” Said her mother<br />
<br />
“Morning Mom.” Said Kim as it took her mother a moment.<br />
<br />
“Kim?” inquired her mother<br />
<br />
“Ya…my voice changed.” Explained Kim “Happened while I slept.”<br />
<br />
“You sound different, I almost didn’t recognize your voice.” Admitted her mother<br />
<br />
“Well you may have trouble recognizing me, I have grown 3 inches and all around I look like….” Kim stopped should couldn’t say she looked like a better version of herself, that would insult her mother and while not super close she loved her mother. “Like a different person.”<br />
<br />
“I believe it.” Confirmed her mother as the sound of screaming could be heard. “Ah…sorry dear, Mary Sue called off so I have to cover the morning shift, so I have to get back to work. I’ll call you before I leave for work tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…thanks mom.” said Kim as the call ended. As the call ended there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
“Come in.” <br />
<br />
The door opened and Sharon was standing in the door, like her she had changed overnight, maybe in a more drastic way on the outside but not nearly as much. Her fur which had been a black tone like her skin had turned snow white with black strips and parts of her dark skin was were now darker and in a strip pattern. Her eyes had also become silted like a cat and most of all pointed ears poked out of the top of her black hair. <br />
<br />
“You want to come with me to group?” inquired Sharon as Kim blinked. “Everyone has to go to group counseling, or they come down on you thinking you are suicidal or the like, and in the morning there are less people in group. Too many people are waking up and adjusting to their changes, smaller group faster sessions and more free time afterwards as everyone else takes group in afternoon.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Kim <br />
<br />
“That is what someone told me when I first came and so far it seams true.” Confirmed Sharon “Not that there is much to talk about, I am a black woman becoming a white tiger woman. I could make so many race jokes it isn’t funny.”<br />
<br />
“I am an ugly girl becoming a goddess. Who can’t wait to put her bullies in their place” half joked Kim with a slight laugh, she stopped her laugh had changed as well. <br />
<br />
“Hell if you just stole their boyfriends that would be ease enough to do to them with what you are becoming.” Offered Sharon “So shall we go to group?”</p>
