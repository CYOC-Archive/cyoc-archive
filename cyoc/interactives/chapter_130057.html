<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“If I’m going to find out why you’re friend Samantha is half Samoan I should probably get started now,” Merlin stated. Kellie nodded as she watched the old wizard stand. “Okay,” She’s answered. “But What should I do? Should I go with Lisa to Jason’s house, talk with Claudia, or talk with Mary Elise?”<br />
<br />
“Your choice,” Merlin shrugged. “Now for me this could take awhile to figure out but don’t worry. Only a couple of hours will pass here. I’ll be back as soon as possible so don’t worry. Take care Kellie I wish you luck.” Kellie hugged her ancient mentor tightly before watching him vanish.<br />
<br />
Merlin wasn’t quite sure where to start looking but guessed he could most likely find clues to this question in other realities. Reappearing in am alternate timeline the ancient wizard now scanned the area. “A McDonalds parking lot,” he questioned. “What does this have to do with Samantha?” The movement of someone nearby caused the old wizard to hide. As he now peaked out from his hiding place he smiled. <br />
<br />
Merlin recognized the old man in the parking lot as Jacob Wheeler, Samantha’s husband in an alternate reality. As he watched the old man he noticed him growing younger. Jacobs silver hair gradually returned to its original brown. Merlin continued to watch as Jacob became younger and younger. Soon the man was in his prime with dark brown hair and a muscular body. Merlin watched though as the mans body became less muscular as time wore on. Soon a teenage boy in baggy clothing stood bewildered in the parking lot. Merlin watched as the teen shrank several inches leaving a confused boy of 14.<br />
<br />
“I remember this,” Merlin smiled. “Samantha and Jacobs first date.” Like clockwork Merlin watched as a now 14 year old Samantha raced out of the restaurant trying to gain Jacobs attention. The boy turned and smiled at the young girl. Merlin now watched as the two began to talk only to see the young Samantha blush wildly as she grabbed her pigtails. A few more words were uttered between the two befor events Jacob took Samantha’s hand. The two teens clothing now changed as they walked towards a pizzeria.<br />
<br />
“This was such a cute exchange between these two,” he smiled. “It amazes me how much he was able to bring Samantha out of her shell. The girl Kellie and I have gotten to know is no where near this sure of herself. Still a clutz but not as confident.”<br />
<br />
Merlin realized that the two would be awhile and thought it better to speed ahead in time. With a wave of his hand he watched as Samantha and Jacob exited the pizzeria and scanned the parking lot. Merlin smiled as he watched Judy, Samantha’s mother, appear. “So,” he mused. “She was conjured in this reality.” Merlin had seen it happen in front of him. For a moment their was nothing I front of him then slowly a portal opened inside of Jacobs car. As Merlin watched the portal he could see Judy emerge. The woman seemed bewildered at first before shaking her head and driving towards her daughter. Merlin watched as Samantha and Jacob entered the car and drove away.<br />
<br />
Merlin pondered these events thoughtfully as he rubbed his chin. When Samantha was regressed into her youth the ring had pulled forth a version of her mother to take care of her. The reality Alteration made Judy somewhat magical in nature to begin with. If that was the case then she could quite easily have been drawn to the Magic Shop. “Probably should check a reality where Judy is In the shop,” he mused. Waving his hands the elderly wizard now seamlessly vanished from the parking lot.<br />
<br />
The next thing Merlin could see was his shop, glancing around her noticed a very young Kellie and Judy now running through the shop unaccompanied. Curiously he watched the two children went from shelf to shelf checking out various items. As they did he could see Judy separate from Kellie, Merlin paused as they did. “Where are those two off too,” he thought. Before he could figure it out he noticed Kellie find a machine in the back of the shop. Alarmed he watched as the young girl put a quarter in the machine. “Oh no,” he mumbled. Merlin now watched as Kellie began to transform into An imp.<br />
<br />
Kellie, now Kel’iath, began to change. The girls skin grew darker and more demonic while her fingers and toes changed to claws. Shaking his head he teleported to the front desk, to talk to himself.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” he said to the other Merlin. The Merlin behind the counter turned, slightly alarmed by his doppelgänger. “Well hello,” he said. “I must say this is a most unexpected visit.”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded in response as he looked at himself. “I was going to say the same thing,” he mused. “But I could use your help. You see I am looking for the girl Judy, she just came in with Kellie, Tricia, and Katie.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes of course,” Merlin nodded behind the counter. “I believe she found a rather powerful item. It was a wishing coin, however I think I may have mislabeled it, it has some reality altering magic in it as well.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Merlin nodded ruefully. “Do you know where she went?”<br />
<br />
The other Merlin pointed towards the front of the shop wher Katie and Tricia were located. “Thank you,” Merlin answered. “By the way you may want to go check on Kellie. She’s transformed into a imp girl.”<br />
<br />
“Fiddlesticks,” the Merlin behind the muttered. “Thanks for telling me, can’t have a 7 year old imp girl running around unchecked.” Merlin smiled as he watched his doppelgänger race towards the back of the store, trying to fix his mistake. As he turned he noticed that Judy was nowhere to be found. “Blast,” he thought. “Lost her I’ll have to try and found out where she went to.”<br />
<br />
Merlin appeared outside a small home next. Noticing how cold it was the ancient wizard drew his robes closer as he gazed at the home. “Where am I now,” he wondered. Merlin’s question was answered as he saw an adult Kellie pull into the driveway. He watched now as a 10 year old Katie and Mary Elise hustled towards the front door. As they were about to knock on the door Merlin noticed another car pull-up to the driveway. “Judy and Samantha,” Merlin stated as he watched a 10 year old girl lead her mother towards her friends.<br />
<br />
The two women talked for a moment before an elderly Claudia appeared in the doorway. Merlinwatched as the two exchanged pleasantries while their daughters went inside. After a few moments Claudia closed the door as Judy and Kellie entered their cars. The two mothers seemed to have made plans with eachother as they followed eachother down the street. <br />
<br />
“Probably my best option is to follow them,” he thought. “I’ve already jumped through a couple of realities and chances are these two have something to do with my Samantha.” Rubbing his chin Merlin began to follow. He realized the chances were probably slim the two would lead him to anything substantial, still it was his best lead so far. If he choose not to however it would mean searching more realities, he needed to decide quickly though before Kellie and Judy vanished from sight.</p>
