<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The heavily fortified interview room was such to protect the staff of the auction more than the buyer. In the off chance that a larger non-human creature managed to break out of their restraints, containment and control of the mechandise was the priority.<br />
<br />
Room 7 was about normal size, reminescent of the interrogation scene from old movies. Cameron sat patiently on a chair bolted to the ground as the guards lead Denise in and clasped her heavy leg irons to the floor. Her arm bracers were similarly shackled to the steel desk between them. One of the guards put a gun to her head as the other removed the heavy muzzle locking her jaws shut. Once that came off, she put her head down quickly to reduce the threat to the guards. At the end of the day, they were the ones who could find an excuse to end her. Especially after she had nearly torn an arm off of their particularly cruel boss.<br />
<br />
The guards turned to exit the room. One of them huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck, buddy, she ain&#39;t some fucking delicate flower. Knock when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both exited the room and the heavy door slammed shut and sealed. The sound of the outside locks engaging echoed through the plated walls and then all fell silent.<br />
<br />
The deinonychus exhaled heavily and visibly fell against her restraints. Her considerable muscles relaxed and she slumped slightly, her tail hitting the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; Cameron took off his gloves and pocketed them. &quot;You&#39;re a smart girl. I&#39;m sure you know what&#39;s happening here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say I believe it.&quot; She said nervously. &quot;I didn&#39;t think guys like you existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m nobody.&quot; The executive shrugged. &quot;My name is Cameron.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my name.&quot; The deinonychus raised her jaws to look at him and her good eye twinkled slightly. She was terrified of having hope. He could see it all over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; He took a deep breath and his stoic face cracked a little. He was equally nervous, for what it was worth. The dinosaur studied his face intently. &quot;So, did you... feel the same connection?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; She said simply, gulping.<br />
<br />
He put his hands on the table calmly and reached for her claws. They were both trembling a little. Her eyes widened as his fingers touched the rough leather of her hands and she looked back at him with shock.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t waste words. &quot;Denise, do you want to get the hell out of here? I&#39;ll take good care of you, love you, and give you a life where you&#39;ll be treated with respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right from the fuckin&#39; heart, huh, ace?&quot; She smiled for the first time and he could see her sharp serrated teeth. &quot;Now, hold on, before you pull the trigger here, there&#39;s some shit you should know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine print, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she shook her head and snorted. &quot;You already know the fine print. Don&#39;t be a bastard to me and we&#39;ll see what happens. I&#39;m a person, not your property.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair.&quot; He nodded. &quot;I read what you&#39;ve been through. I have no intention of making you a play thing. I want a companion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right. So we&#39;re clear.&quot; She leaned back and rolled her shoulders, tugging at the uncomfortable arm restraints. &quot;Since you have the courtesy to be straight with me, I&#39;ll do the same.&quot; The dinosaur&#39;s plump chest rose and fell quickly. She exhaled sharply and lowered her head before looking back to him. &quot;I&#39;m a fucking mess, Cameron. There&#39;s all kinds of shit wrong with me in the head. I&#39;m scarred inside and out, I&#39;m broken in places, and if you take me home with you you&#39;re walking out with damaged goods. I&#39;ve got depression, I need meds, I&#39;m violent, and sometimes I just cry for no goddamn reason and I can&#39;t stop for hours. I&#39;m fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The human stared at the dinosaur and his face softened. There was an awkward silence as he considered. &quot;Listen, Denise, I&#39;m sitting here across from a lady who&#39;s been treated like shit in ways I can&#39;t possibly comprehend. I don&#39;t think that changes a thing. I look at you, and I see a beautiful and strong saurian woman who can take my loneliness and hurt away. I&#39;m attracted to you and I want to rescue you. We could have a life together. A good life. And if it means rebuilding you from the ground up, piece by piece, and helping you heal, I&#39;ll do whatever I need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
This hit the dinosaur like a truck. &quot;Is this real?&quot; She leaned in. &quot;Like... don&#39;t fuck with me here, man. I mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is real.&quot; Cameron stared into her eyes. Again, the connection. The bond. They were meant for each other. They could both feel it in the air.<br />
<br />
The deinonychus leaned back, emotionally exhausted, and nodded gently. &quot;There&#39;s something else, right? Like, I believe you, but there&#39;s more to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Cameron nodded. &quot;There is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; The dinosaur nodded to him sharply. &quot;Let&#39;s have it. If you want a partner we should be honest with each other from the start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really into you.&quot; He blushed slightly, meekly. &quot;I love strong independant scaly girls. It&#39;s like you were made for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made the saurian woman outright laugh, a sweet growling noise, and she shook her head. &quot;I wasn&#39;t made for you. I was made for some other asshole. I mean, Jesus, you&#39;re a charmer, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Cameron laughed nervously. &quot;I think I&#39;m cheesy as fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.&quot; She grinned. &quot;I like it. It&#39;s cute.&quot; She paused for a moment, considered, and nodded. &quot;Yeah, all right. All right. So you&#39;re into scaly girls, you&#39;re alone, you&#39;re a decent man, and you want me to keep me. Is that it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Cameron nodded back. &quot;That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This... this could work.&quot; Denise admitted. &quot;This could really work out for both of us. I&#39;m a lot of work, though. I just want to make that clear. I&#39;m not just going to hop in your bed. I can&#39;t. I need to feel something and know you. I need to trust you. Feel safe. Right now, you&#39;re just some guy with pretty words.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fair. That&#39;s completely fair.&quot; The human nodded, relieved. &quot;I agree, this could work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it doesn&#39;t?&quot; The deinonychus asked sharply, eyeing him carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then at least you don&#39;t have to rot in a cage or be forced to be a prize for some mob boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have work?&quot; She cocked her head. &quot;You&#39;re a business guy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of it.&quot; He smiled knowingly. &quot;I own a large company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if I wanted out... you&#39;d let me be free? Set me up?&quot; She raised an eye ridge in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second you get into my car, Denise, you&#39;re free. It would hurt, but yes, if you really don&#39;t like me, I absolutely promise I will give you full freedom. They&#39;re going to give you a new ID. I&#39;d let you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dinosaur went deathly silent and still. Her colors darkened as her emotions swirled around inside, unseen. She nodded slowly. &quot;You&#39;re not a man.&quot; She whispered. &quot;You&#39;re an angel. Let&#39;s do it. Get me the fuck out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot; Cameron smiled. &quot;I&#39;d hug you, but I know we&#39;re not supposed to touch yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d really like that right now.&quot; She said, voice wavering as the human rose to knock on the armored door.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you soon, Denise.&quot; Cameron whispered as the locks disengaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. See you soon.&quot; The deinonychus smiled to herself, closing her eyes and smiling as she imagined what this could be.</p>
