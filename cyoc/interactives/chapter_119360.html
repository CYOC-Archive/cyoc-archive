<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was sitting at my desk, It was late at night around 12pm. I looked down from the clock and typed on the computer. Finishing my latest report on the criminals of the city. You see I was a city reporter for Gotham records, my latest report the one I&#39;m most proud of is this one about the revolution of venom and it&#39;s needs. I thought it was all rubbish so I shut It all down with my report. The powers of writing more powerful them brute force. <br />
<br />
I click send on my report and see the loading bar fill with green it then disappears. I turn off the computer with a day&#39;s work complete, I knock over some hate mail as I go for my coffee. It pick it up and look at it, just empty threats from criminals in the city. I put them back on the shelf and grap my coffee. Suddenly I hear a loud noise from behind me which causes me to drop my coffee. It lands on the soft carpet and lies there in pieces. I look down and pick up the pieces one by one slowly. I stand up and look to see a person wearing full black standing there.<br />
<br />
I scream and fall back, they thrust themselves towards me. I grab my gun and shoot them before they get to me, the person cry&#39;s out in pain and I run past them. It walk pass office after office and make it for the elevator. Another person in full black jumps towards me, they push me over. I see a needle in there hands and I grab my gun and punch them out the way. Their needle falls to the ground. In a fit panic I grab the needle and inject them with it. They scream as it pierces their skin then silence. It must have been a quick poison or something.<br />
<br />
Frightened for my life, I run past the elevator and go down the service stairs. I could hear my feet hit the ground as I clambered down the stairs. Each foot a small echo fills the stairwell. A cold sound which would alert anyone of my presence. I keep running  though going past floor 17 to floor 5 in a matter of seconds. Once I made it to the second floor I didn&#39;t go any further. I heard noises from the below &quot;The reporter has escaped keep the ground floor secure we don&#39;t want him escaping&quot;. I go up another flight and run through the door. I sit down and see tears etching their way out of my eyes. I sniffle and take out my phone.<br />
<br />
But it seems all my luck had ran out, my phone was gone it was must have fell out of my trousers when I got tackled by that person. I knew I was on my own. By now they would be up there and have destroyed any evidence against my disappearance. Which I knew was my death. I run towards the window in the only resolution I could think of. I open it and look down, there was no one outside. The fall wouldn&#39;t kill me but would hurt me. I breath heavily and climb through the window. I count to 5 in my head and then jump. I feel the air rush pass me as I fall. It felt slower than I hoped it would be. I hit the ground and I feel a cracking break my fall. I hold the pain in and stand up.<br />
<br />
I limp over the hedges and out on to the road. There was no one around, of course not. I walk onto the road and look around. The skyscrapers seemed taller then they were. They shadows made the street darker, and the streetlamps were all petruding an unnatural green glow. I walk down the road slowly but then I hear something. A slow clapping as get closer to me. I turn around and see something walking towards me. Except they weren&#39;t some normal person, they were a very big person like nothing you&#39;ve never seen big. They were hidden in shadows and I could barely make out them at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop running, seriously, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your strong point&quot;. He points towards my broken leg and laughs. He voice is very low and his laughing sends chills down my spine. &quot;If you just wanted to kill me, why haven&#39;t you already&quot; I ask scared. He chuckles again and is slowly advancing towards me. &quot;What are you talking about we aren&#39;t going to kill you, we just want to make you understand.&quot; He says slowly and low. I point my gun at him and say &quot;Show me what?&quot; my hands are shaking. &quot;Show you this&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
He does something with his hands and suddenly I could hear loud mechanical noises. I didn&#39;t notice this before but he had a green glow coming from his back. He takes off his black clothes. And I see him wearing a leathery suit with pipes coming out his back. He falls to the ground and starts growling loudly. In terror I pace backwards still holding the gun at him. Suddenly he holds out his arm and it grows two sizes bigger. I must have been imaging things. He started growing violently in front of me. All his muscles seem to be bulging outwards. He was grunting loudly and sounded in pain but also like he was enjoying it. It didn&#39;t stop until he was at least the size of the lamppost. &quot;This is what you could be&quot; he said &quot;If you let me make you understand&quot;. <br />
<br />
I shoot him and it flies off his leather chest like it was nothing. In unimaginable fear I start running away until I feel a small pain in my neck and I fall to the ground. The world starts disappearing and the massive person walks towards me. He grabs my hand and makes me feel his muscles. &quot;Do you feel that, you will want that ever so soon&quot;. My eyes flicker as the hardness of his muscles causing me to go numb and fall to sleep</p>
