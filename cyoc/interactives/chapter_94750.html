<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger&#39;s black lips curled into a sinister sneer, loving how he was going to play a major role in the uprising of the werewolf species... a species that had only been a myth until it actually became a reality. In the beginning, Roger thought it was only recently since Chad gave him the call that changed his life, but he realized shortly after his own transformation that it was much longer than he even knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Alpha, my Beta and friend... I do have an idea for you to turn the humans here into your army my lieges.&quot; Roger uttered with that same sneer planted on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you...&quot; Rusty began to say, but was interrupted just as he started. &quot;Actually... hold that thought. I-I have to go... I am being summoned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Now?! You&#39;ve only been back for a short time after fifteen years! Please... my mate... don&#39;t leave me.&quot; Chad said as concern, dread, sorrow and worry in immense fear of losing his mate for an incredibly long and undetermined amount of time like the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes now... I do not have another choice. I cannot tell you what is going to happen, but I can assure you that this is different. The portal summons me to come before it, but it does not summon me to speak or enter it again.&quot; Rusty said confidently and smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do you mean?!&quot; Chad asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... don&#39;t know anything more than that. I feel it call to me, but not like the first time... it summons me for some reason. You felt the power, you know of what I speak Chad.&quot; Rusty said raising a paw to scratch and stroke behind Chad&#39;s right ear.<br />
<br />
Chad wanted to lower his head, showing submission to his mate and Alpha because he definitely knew what Rusty was talking about. Over the course of those fifteen years, Chad had only been summoned by the portal a handful of times... maybe three or four times at the most and it was not something anyone would be capable of ignoring. It was a strong, almost magnetic pull that drew anyone it chose to it... as if it was a magnet to any biologic and organic cellular entity. It wasn&#39;t anything Chad could comprehend, even with his advanced knowledge in things pertaining to cells and such. Finally Chad sighs &quot;I know Rusty... I just wish it didn&#39;t come with the possibility of not seeing or being with you for an undetermined amount of time.<br />
<br />
Rusty smiled, placing both hybrid human wolf paws on his muzzle, forcing Chad to look at Rusty&#39;s own loving gaze. &quot;Hey... it&#39;ll be alright. It&#39;s not like that this time, I promise you!&quot; Then, before he let go, Rusty planted a big wolf kiss on his partner and mate&#39;s muzzle with their lupine tongues swirling around and wrestling with one another.<br />
<br />
Pulling off, he smiled and headed into the elevator and ascended to the main floor. As the doors opened to the metallic car, Rusty sighed and said softly under his breath to himself, &quot;I hope the portal doesn&#39;t make a liar out of me.&quot; and then stepped out of the car, into the closet of Chad&#39;s room. He smiled as the soft woven fibers of the carpet brushed against his thick, black paw pads and ventured through the men&#39;s wing to the room where he knew the portal was. The closer and closer that he got to the main hall, the more he could smell a familiar scent... no... a familiar odor. It was the smell of necrotic flesh, sulphur and phosphorous. Instantly he knew one thing for certain... he wasn&#39;t being summoned by the portal... he was summoned by the hell hound that started all of this for them. Not knowing what the hell hound was there for, what it could want... Rusty knew that he couldn&#39;t keep it waiting or it could do anything imaginable to him or the others. Rusty knew that it was the hell hound that linked him to the portal, which meant that it had ultimate and total control over anything in the universe. Closer and closer Rusty got, his nose was overwhelmed by the smell as he was nearly upon the main hall; his eyes watered from the sheer intensity and it was so strong that he could even taste it. At first, it was horrible and vile, but as he was exposed to it for that short amount of time... it was almost pleasant to him somehow. He even could feel himself begin to crave the taste of blood and flesh as he could even feel himself grow darker and more evil the closer he got to the hell hound. Suddenly, as Rusty stepped into the main hall not only could he feel a surge in that new darkness within him, but he could see both the hell hound and the portal behind it.<br />
<br />
The vortex that existed just how Rusty had remembered it, except for the color was much, much different. Instead of the brilliant and bright sky blue swirling energy, it was still brilliant, but in it’s darkness. It was a swirling vortex of crimson red and black energy that led to the same black opening in the invisible fabric that was the veil between dimensions and worlds. In front of the portal was what looked to be the same exact hell hound that visited him all those years ago, which was just a day or two ago for him. Though his vision was better since the moment the hell hound visited his room all that time ago and started his journey as a werewolf, it was still hard to make out every detail of the beast. As Rusty got closer and closer to the beast from hell, he could see that it was still the exact same creature from before. It had the body, the overall look and fur color of a Doberman Pinscher with the same fire leaping from its’ eyes and the thick smoke that billowed and plumed from his mouth. As Rusty stood before it in his massive werewolf form, he felt as though he should kneel in respect and reverence for the being. As he did so, lowering his head at the same time, something about the beast was different.<br />
<br />
“Rise, my champion! Rise and greet me as a champion should!” It said as its’ lips pulled back into a muzzled smile, as any species with a muzzle would.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m your champion?!” Rusty said in slight confusion, not about the title… since it was pretty obvious since the portal chose him, but more so because the beast could speak.<br />
<br />
“I am not a beast, for starters… I am your Lord!” He said aloud as the fire and smoke increased in intensity for that moment. “Yes… I can also hear your thoughts. I am, after all, a being of malevolent evil.”<br />
<br />
“Yes… my Lord. My apologies. Your presence here has just thrown me off. I wasn’t expecting a hell hound to be what summoned me to the portal… not to mention… the same hell hound that made me and all the others like this!” Rusty explained, knowing that he didn’t have to since he could hear his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Yes… I know, but I have come to reward you. You see… what you have accomplished has only been phase one of a massive plan to win over the one known as God. He has stripped and deprived you of the truth for so long. Humanity was never supposed to remain as you are as all the angels that had any part in your species’ creation intended. You see… humans are a hodge-podge of every beast that lives here on the planet you call Earth. Your true selves reflect the animals that your lineage comes from, unlike what creationists and evolutionists even theorize. For you, you were made a werewolf because your evolutionary lineage comes from the wolf. Those you have turned all had bits of wolf in them, but your genetic instruction overruled the rest and brought out the wolf in them as well. I also chose this form for myself due to that woman’s involvement  and the lore about hell hounds, which made it the easiest for you to comprehend instead of my true form.” The hell hound Lord explained.<br />
<br />
“My Lord… then… what is your true form? I would be honored if you showed your true self to me!” Rusty said in a pleading tone, revering the entity, not really knowing what to think about all of this.<br />
<br />
“So… you wish to see my true form then? Very well… you have earned that much and what I have to bestow upon you from here on out. Plus, I will need to be in my true form to give you such a gift anyway.” The Lord said grinning fiendishly as it seemed to close its’ eyes since the fires diminished and went out completely.<br />
<br />
In an instant, those very eyes snapped wide open and the flames shot out of them much higher, fuller and completely. As the flames rose from the sockets, thicker smoke than usual plumed from his mouth as it slowly encased all four of its’ paws. As the smoke blanketed his extremities, the flames reached up and over his head as it built and spread, using the thick fur as further fuel. Smoke that rose from that mixed and swirled around his body, turning him into one massive ovalish ball of embers, fire and smoke that swirled around and within itself like a self contained sphere. Slowly, but surely, the sphere rose from the ground until it was several feet up and then it began to take shape once more. This time though, Rusty could tell the entity was completely bi-pedal as two legs, a waist, torso, shoulders, arms, neck and head took shape. Then the smoke slowed to just standing still as the glowing embers all floated to the top of the smoke body, adhering together to create more of his Lord’s form. Further details came alive in him as Rusty could make out a human face, horns above the brows, claws adorning the fingers and toes, a thin tail with a spaded tip at the end, along with a set of cock and balls that would make anyone jealous and envious of it. Then, as the embers solidified together and began glowing in a flowing pattern… like the dying embers of a log or charcoal grill fire, the raging fire that had been at the heart of the hell hound rose to staggering proportions as the same fire billowed from his Lord’s eyes, mouth and nose as more detail and solid form came into being. His skin was nicely tanned; his body was huge, thickly muscled and all around beefy; his horns were like ebony hooks of unbreakable bone; his eyes were normal, except for the crimson red of the outer ring of his iris while the interior transitioned from orange to yellow, as if they were showing the flames of hell; yet most impressive of all was his Lord’s package, which made Rusty’s mouth hung agape and drooling profusely. His Lord looked as though he was eight inches in length, but as thick as a Foster’s can of beer with massive, baseball sized orbs in a tight sack that had thick devilish seed swirling inside, waiting to get out and bless the next being to receive it. <br />
<br />
As Rusty simply started at it, it throbbed and jumped slightly while a thick, pearlescent bead of pre formed at the slit and started to trickle down to the crown. The Dark Lord could see that Rusty was on the edge of anticipation, hoping to be given the ok to sample the Lord’s essence. With a voice that sounded like a thousand souls speaking at once, trailing behind each other by just a second, his Lord spoke. “Go ahead my champion. Taste me. Drink from me and let me imbue you with the final phase of your form to then lead my army and rule over the Earth instead of the humans who seek to destroy it!”<br />
<br />
Rusty just grins widely and without hesitating a single moment, he lunges forward while opening his muzzle wide, letting the impressively thick member slide in against his rough textured and thin lupine tongue. Slowly he worked the meat over in his muzzle, moaning from the delectable taste while the Dark Lord just let Rusty have his way with his meat. The Dark Lord moaned under his breath, not wanting Rusty to stop his ministrations, feeling pleasure like he was for the first time in a very long time. Even though he didn’t want it to stop, he could feel his cock swell a bit more in the werewolf’s muzzle as an indicator of his climax drawing near, forcing the fleshy enclosure to bulge as Rusty struggled to keep it all inside because of the sheer thickness of it. At the same time, however, Rusty took the increase in size to mean that he was doing a perfect job and he increased everything in intensity and frequency.<br />
<br />
“Mmm… oh fuck yeah Rusty! I am so close…” The Dark Lord finally called out to his champion, sucking on his teeth and hissing just a bit before the mammoth cock locked in Rusty’s muzzle twitched. <br />
<br />
Immediately the meat engorged a bit further as Rusty could feel the veins and urethra contract quickly as the Dark Lord’s thick load of cum gushed into his muzzle as he pulled back for the majority to land on the sensitive tongue to completely and fully taste the load. Rusty moaned as gush after thick gush of the thick cream pumped into him and slid down into his belly. The Dark Lord reaching out, scritching behind Rusty’s left ear and guided his last bit of suckling as the torrent finished with the patter of a few quick and short jets of the thickest bit of his seed. Finally feeling the cock soften in his muzzle, Rusty grinned and let the sensitive flesh carefully slip from his maw as the clear remnants left a trail behind it. Enjoying what he just did, Rusty continued to grin while he cooed in contentment.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… my Lord, that was a very nice treat!” Rusty said as he licked his maw clean.<br />
<br />
“Well… I am glad you enjoyed it, first of all. Second, it was exactly what you needed for Phase Two to begin!” His Lord said with an evilly suggestive smile.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what is Phase Two… my Lord?” He asked as his facial muscles physically showed his confusion.<br />
<br />
“Oh… well it’s really quite simple. I awaken the larger portion of the power I put inside of you, which you needed my demonic seed for, you take on your full form with all of those you’ve previously turned being awoken just from your powerful presence alone. Then, continue with the plans you’ve already began enacting before I summoned you. Once this entire city is within your army… we will move onto Phase Three, which is our final phase.” The Dark Lord said while stroking Rusty’s head and petting him.<br />
<br />
“Then… Phase Three is taking over the planet and removing humans from their destructive domination of the Earth?” Rusty asked with a rising inflection, indicating his pure curiosity and agreement with it.<br />
<br />
“You would be correct! Now… my dear champion, give into my seed and let it awaken your full form!” The Dark Lord commanded in a dominating growly voice.<br />
<br />
At the moment the demonic being spoke to him, to the deeper and now fueled part of Rusty that had been asleep and dormant began to stir. Rusty just moaned as slight beads of sweat formed on his brow.<br />
<br />
“Yes… that’s it… give in and awaken.” The Dark Lord coaxed the being inside of Rusty and his mind to relax, letting himself go while just going with whatever was happening to him in the moment.<br />
<br />
Rusty growled deeper and if he weren’t already devoid of clothing, he’d be tearing at them to get them off, trying any way that he could to reduce his body temperature. Rusty closed his eyes and focused on the moment, doing exactly as his Lord commanded and felt the heat in him rise further and further, as if fire were lapping at his skin and fur. He could feel something in him that was alive and more awake than Rusty could even begin to fathom. He wanted it out… he wanted to see exactly what this different thing inside of himself turned out to be. “My… my Lord! I-it feels… ggggoooooddddd!!!!” Rusty moaned as he could feel whatever this new thing was burning his old self away, working from the inside out still. Now… more than before… he wanted whatever it was free and there was nothing that was going to keep him from having just that. That gift of true freedom was within his grasp and Rusty held onto it tightly, not about to let it go for any reason… even if it took away his immortal soul. He didn’t care what the cost was… nothing was too high that he’d pay… even if that meant that all beings close to him had to die! There was nothing in his life at the moment other than that new self coming out to play.</p>
