<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moving Day is the day after the last final exams, and a Saturday. You and Gene were moving into the same first-floor shared suite together for the two summer sessions. You had for all practical purposes been living in Gene&#39;s room for weeks. Except for your backpack, books, and laptop, you lived out of Gene&#39;s closet. Both of you boxed the stuff in your dorm room and took it to your bedroom at your parent&#39;s house. Thankfully they were not home when you and Gene carried up and unpacked all nine boxes from the dorm room. You both didn&#39;t leave until all the boxes were unpacked and everything neatly arranged, Gene insisted on tidyness. As you closed the door to your old bedroom, you let it sink in how much you are dedicated to Gene. You both were quiet on the drive back to the dorm. Gene&#39;s call for a full body long sleeve catsuit was a good idea, breathable and not constricting. His metallic black suit showed some of the cardboard fibers, while your bright red suit had a seam that was splitting your ass in two glowing red hemispheres. You did get Gene to wear wool socks, very low profile, with his sandles. You did the same with your teva&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The summer dorm was also the dorm used by most of the varsity athletes. The rooms were smaller and shared a bathroom. You registered for a room and Gene the ajoining room, that way you both would not be sharing with strangers and had more room than before.  You and Gene continued working past lunch since the dining hall was closed until Monday. You both put all 24 of the large boxes in one of the new rooms. Gene stayed to start unpacking while you return to clean up the two empty dorm rooms the two of you emptied previously.<br />
<br />
Change for the better is good. Most of the changes since you bought the flashlight are good. Gene went from some guy you knew in the dorm to your shemfriend. Your doughy, un-toned body was looking a lot better, but still not close to the tight body Gene was sporting. Your up to running 7 miles in 50 minutes, still too slow to make the track squad. The track coach did bring you on as a trainer, which you would be learing how to do that job this summer. At first, all of the guys and shem&#39;s flirting with Gene really bothered you. Gene would alway let them off with class and style. Still, there were times Gene invited one or two of the team to our room. It really bothered you, but you were with Gene, and that was the thing. The other thing that bothered you is that these &quot;guests&quot; were all into Gene, and didn&#39;t want to include you. Most of these fake friends only hung out once, after that the novelty wore off for them.<br />
<br />
There was one runner, Donavan, who was a regular for Gene. He had a hard body, washboard abs, was in the weight room a lot, and ran faster than Gene.  He would only offer you to perform oral on himself. Donavan, the shemale, was easier to deal with, and didn&#39;t giving you attention if Gene was otherwise occupied. You kept the masculinity of Donavan mostly intact, abs, muscular build, cock, but the face and breasts were all female, a manlier Gene. Donovan lost his jock brutish mentality, and was much more feminine in his thinking. After using the light on Donovan, you made a rule to not use the flashlight, except in cases like Donovan. You also decided to not use the flashlight on yourself.  Your did enjoy the transition of Donovan&#39;s taste in clothes to be very tight and shiny, with maximum exposed flesh. Because of Donovan&#39;s thick, muscular manly thighs, he had to wear compression shorts longer than the middle of this thigh. He placed first in the conference decathlon, yet he placed all credit with the training staff and hard work. You and Gene both looked with awe upon hir, and Donovan became a regular third member to our circle. <br />
<br />
You look around the empty room, except for the bunk bed. You finish the piles of dust and dirt into the toilet and flush. You already packed the trash can, but there is nothing left. You sign the checkout forms for both you and Gene. You return to the new room with the broom and dustpan, and find Gene asleep on the bed. This time, it was a queen size mattress. The room was small with the huge bed. Gene had set up the other room as a sitting/storage room. The dorm was full of others still moving about in the halls, as every team had practice and workouts for the next six weeks.<br />
<br />
You closed the doors to the rooms, and found your backpack. You sat in the other room and checked your grades with your laptop, as well as making sure the flashlight was still buried in the bottom of the backpack. Two 3 hour As, a 2 hour A and two 4 hour B&#39;s, which isn&#39;t great, but will lift your GPA. You shutdown your laptop and put it back into your backpack, then relax and sink into the chair. So far, this is a good change you ponder.</p>
