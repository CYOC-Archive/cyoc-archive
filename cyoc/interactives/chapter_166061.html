<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon enough, after finishing up their stretches they were making teams and started playing volleyball, in order to get better for the big game.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s team was doing rather well, they were all coordinated and played fast, but there it was one girl who seemed to be struggling a bit. That was Laura, a brunette with beautiful green eyes, but no one really looked at them because she had a massive rack. Her breasts were even bigger than marissa&#39;s, and of course significantly huge compared to jen&#39;s, but unlike marissa who was rude and mean to her, jenifer had barely interacted with Laura, in fact, although Laura seemed friendly enough, she was rather quiet and didnt talk to many people. Probably because they focused more on her breasts than in her face. Jennifer could see her getting tired and rubbing her back.<br />
<br />
-&quot;c&#39;mon Laura! Is it everything alright there?&quot; Asked the coach.<br />
-&quot;im fine, sir. I just...need a moment...can I... get some water?&quot; Replied Laura completely out of breath.<br />
-&quot;very well. Everyone! We can take a break, 5 minutes and we&#39;re back.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the rest of the girls went to the benches to gossip a bit about the guys at the football team, Laura went back to the locker rooms in direction to the bathroom. Jennifer decided to follow her.<br />
<br />
When jen arrived she saw Laura drinking from the faucet, and she saw her looking at her chest in the mirror with a bitter look. Jen talked to her.<br />
<br />
-&quot;oh hey there, Laura!&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;oh? Uh... hi... jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;heh, its actually Jen, but it ok&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;oh, right, sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot; is everything ok, Laura? You seem tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;yea I know. I keep training an working out but I still cant improve anymore. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m fit for the team.&quot; She replied sadly.<br />
<br />
-&quot;huh, and why is that?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
-&quot;well guess, won&#39;t you?&quot; Said Laura, pointing to her huge boobs with a bit of visible frustration. &quot;This things got so big as I grew up. It was cool at first, seeing everyone look at me but now they always get on the way and they kinda overshadow me, and my back hurts like hell all the time.... sigh...I dont think I I&#39;ll ever be a sport star at this rate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen listened to her and realized how bad she must have felt with those huge breasts, that might have been a blessing for others, but for her they were her curse.  And Jen figured what to do.<br />
<br />
-&quot;say. I have an idea. I know one thing to do that will help you out with your back problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;really? I&#39;ve tried everything. Stretches. diets. creams. nothing works&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;trust me on this one. Let&#39;s give it a go!&quot; Insisted Jen.<br />
<br />
-&quot;alright...if you say so, Jen....&quot; said Laura still not convinced. &quot; what should I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;Just come closer and take off your shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;What?! Is this a trick to grope me?&quot; Shouted Laura.<br />
<br />
-&quot;no no, trust me. I&#39;ll help you.&quot;  Insisted Jen.<br />
<br />
-&quot;...sigh... ok.&quot; Said Laura as she took her shirt off. Jen saw at her beautiful fleshy orbs, but with no time to waste, she grabbed her left breast with both hands and tugged towards her. As she did so, it popped free from Laura&#39;s chest, who stood motionless in place. Jennifer was amazed by how heavy it really was, she shaked her hands and admired the jiggly breast in her palms, but then she put it aside in a bench and continued with the second one. Soon Laura was as flat as a board, even devoid of nipples,  and her bra fell off. Jen noticed how muscular she really was, now that her breasts were not in her, her abs were the most imoressive thing in her body. Jen placed the boobs aside and looked at Laura, who came back to motion. <br />
<br />
-&quot;so how is it? Feeling better?&quot; Asked jen.<br />
<br />
-&quot;I... I do. I really do, in fact I feel great! My body feels so light! My back is so relieved now! Oh my God thank you Jen! I dont know what you did but my back fell as good as it has never been before!&quot; Laura hugged jen happily,  probably as tight as she had never done so before. she wasn&#39;t aware of the fact that she used to have boobs and that jen had taken them off, she just knew she had a horrible back pain that jen cured, so that was what mattered. <br />
<br />
-&quot;time&#39;s up! Let go back to play!&quot; Shouted the coach.<br />
<br />
-&quot;comming! C&#39;mon jen let&#39;s ts go!&quot; Said laura as she put on the shirt that now it was too big for her, and ran to the gym, Seems like the decrease in mass had made her quicker. Jen felt happy for helping someone with her new powers, and was about to leave, when she realized she couldn&#39;t leave Laura&#39;s rack in the open, so she carried them into her locker for now. They were so soft and squishy, she kinda wished to keep them, but even tho she could, she kne she shouldn&#39;t,  so she just got over it and stuffed them inside, were they almost didnt fit properly.<br />
<br />
Back in the game, Laura&#39;s performance had increased a lot. She was quicker at running, her movement was more precise, and didnt got as exhausted this time.<br />
<br />
-&quot;wow Laura! Now that what I call a good performance! How wonderful having a bit of water can be!&quot; Said the coach, unaware that the girl who was playing was well over a D cup a  couple minutes ago and now she was a no cup at all. Only Jen knew of Laura&#39;s ample chest, and she couldn&#39;t think of anything else, but meantwhile Laura could only think of the great days to come.</p>
