<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I begin to wake up. I&#39;m lying on the couch in the living room. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?&quot; <br />
<br />
My voice,  it sounds different to me. Lighter,  somehow. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s awake now.&quot; <br />
<br />
I look over and see my little girl standing there,  smiling. Next to her i see....myself!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there. Charlie!&quot; says my daughter.<br />
<br />
Confused,  i sit up into a more sitting position. My body feels light and maneuverable. Not that i wasnt able to move before. But this was somehow....different. <br />
<br />
As i sat up,  i noticed i was wearing those clothes that i found in a bag in her room! New shoes,  long Nime docks,  black shorts,  and blue T-shirt! <br />
<br />
The clothes were a perfect fit,  though the shorts were a bit long. Sticking out of those shorts,  were a pair of hairless,  youthful legs that led into a pair of size ten shoes! Shoes that looked a bit on the large size compared to the short, smooth legs that are apparently attached to me! <br />
<br />
I then noticed my shortened,  youthened hairless forearms,  and my much smaller hands. I next noticed i was much slimmer,  and started patting my smaller chest and smooth belly beneath my shirt. Not an ounce of my hard-earned muscle anywhere!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.....CHARLIE!&quot; A deeper voice,  full of mirth and amusement. I look up from my exploration of my new body. At the towering figure of my former self. The voice sounds different than I&#39;m used to,  yet i am used to. Sounds exactly like my twin brother!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ch- Charlie!?&quot; I choke out,  intimidated and confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! That&#39;s your name from now on! Charlie Redding! Or,  rather,  Charles Millhouse Redding!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- What are you TALKING about!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m talking about how you&#39;re now my classmate,  and the &quot; REAL&quot; Charlie is now my father!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But. I&#39;m not 12!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right! You are now 11 years old!&quot; Replied the imposter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here!&quot; said my daughter,  Kaylee.<br />
<br />
She was handing me a mirror. I reach out with my reduced arm and grip it with my perfectly formed fingers. My jaw about hit the floor! Looking back was an admittedly nice-looking handsome young boy,  no more than about.....11 years old! The boy&#39;s expression was comical. His eyes wide,  with a dark shade of blue. His mouth open in shock,  just like mine. But those were not my eyes,  nor my mouth. <br />
<br />
His hair was nicely trimmed. Short,  brown with the really short bangs sticking outward and slightly to the side. I reach up to touch the hair on my head. Something I haven&#39;t felt since my junior year of high school! My brother and I started shaving our heads in our senior year. It suited us perfectly well. But even so,  the hair is different. <br />
<br />
I sat there,  wonderingly feeling my smooth,  young face. Searching the mirror for any recognition of familiarity finding none. Nice,  bushy eyebrows without being too bushy. Thickish lips. A small nose slightly on the wide side. Best of all, perfect teeth! Well,  there&#39;s that,  at least. At least the teeth are as good,  straight,  and white as mine were,  even if the two front teeth were a lot longer and broader. This kid i apparently am stuck as being too young for much wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was me. That was my face you now have to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I looked up at a startingly familiar image of myself that looks just like my identical twin brother,  but slightly different. Most people cant tell us spart. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess my mom was right. I was a good looking kid.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do!? What....what happened!?&quot; I demanded.<br />
<br />
My doppelganger smiled,  and lifted his,  my former,  right leg. Nicely tanned,  perfectly formed from years of working out. <br />
<br />
&quot;The socks,  man. And these shoes. We followed you. Stole the socks,  and put those clothes,  which my mom....your mom now....just bought the other day. I been wearing those clothes all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Yuck!&quot; I bounced up,  suddenly creeped out that i was now wearing the clothes a boy id never met had just been wearing. But they looked clean and new.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,  man! I just took a shower and put them ob for the first time before riding my bike....haha,  now your bike....over here! I knocked you out using a date rape drug after i turned into you. I then dressed you in my former clothes after taking a shower,  getting dressed in a fresh set of your own clothing. You daughter....excuse me,  MY daughter now and your slightly OLDER classmate....helped me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unbelievably,  i looked over,  and slightly UP....at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hated you going through my stuff. So,  i recruited Charlie who wanted to be a real man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta gimme those socks!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,  SON! I don&#39;t &quot; GOTTA&quot; do anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shush! Now that you&#39;re acquainted with yourself,  you need to leave MY house! Your mom will be wondering where you ran off to before too long.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I left your bike in the front lawn.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bike? I dont even ride a bike!&quot;<br />
<br />
The imposter reached into the pockets of my jeans he is wearing,  and pulled out a set of keys. My keys!<br />
<br />
&quot;You do now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Those are-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My keys,  my car now!&quot; he finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t even know how to drive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The longer  i wear these socks with these shoes on,  the more of your knowledge and skill I absorb. Taking it away from you. The more of an 11 year old boy you become.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could already tell my confidence was depleted. I felt intimidated standing there,  in a house that was apparently no longer mine. And the girl,  my daughter,  with her big pretty green eyes. Several inches taller than me now. I was beginning to feel....inadequate! <br />
<br />
Kaylee was self-assured. Always has been,  much like me. I could see how kids her age would be intimidated by her. How she was the most popular girl in her class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,  dweeb! Go home!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear,  boys are so dumb, &quot; she said,  turning towards her....uummm...new father. I suddenly had the strong urge to just...beat it out of there. <br />
<br />
And so i did. I heard them laughing,  as i ran out of my own house,  almost in tears. I looked at my car,  longing to hop in and just drive away. But somehow,  i knew i couldn&#39;t drive,  even if it was my car. Instead,  i saw a bike lying in the grass. It was a cool looking white mountain bike. And it slowly became somehow familiar to me. <br />
<br />
I ran over to it. It was a small mountain bike,  but it was big enough for my small sub five-foot body.  I hopped on,  and quickly rode away as fast as my shorter legs would go. <br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t sure where i was headed,  but at some point it dawned on me: I&#39;m just a kid! A young boy,  aged 11,  riding his bicycle on a neighborhood sidewalk. Riding home to mommy! And probably some 6th grade homework.</p>
