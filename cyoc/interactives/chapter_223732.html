<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not sensing Dave at all and calling out his name to a blank canvas, you begin to worry. Was he actually erased? Is he still inside the canvas somewhere? You don&#39;t know. You try calling out his name one more time but no response. Meanwhile Dave who isn&#39;t able to give any response can hear you calling and starts to feel bad that he can&#39;t respond, thinking to himself, &quot;Maybe this wasn&#39;t really a good idea, she really is scared she removed me from reality... I told her to draw something after she erased me, but I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d get this worried...&quot;<br />
<br />
After trying one last time to call to Dave with no reply, you give up with a sigh and even start to cry. No matter what you do, you don&#39;t seem to be getting any response. You wipe off the tears with your sleeve, only to pause briefly because your tears don&#39;t seem like normal tears, appearing slightly glossy like the rest of your appearance. <br />
<br />
With your slight distraction from the situation at hand now over, you do think about how the magic in the canvas has changed you. Your still mentally you, but in all other aspects, are a 3D anime french maid. You aren&#39;t even sure if you can take your clothes off or even have organs underneath your slightly glossy and flat colored appearance... As much as you want to find out, that can wait. The magic in the canvas was able to do this to you but left your mind completely okay, so Dave must still be inside there... Just formless... You think that maybe you should go into the canvas yourself again but worry if you do you&#39;ll have no one to pull you out but this is an emergency, you need to find out if Dave is still in there and there is only one way to check... No, you&#39;ve made up your mind. You&#39;ll go back into the canvas and search for Dave, even if that means potentially getting stuck as a painting permanently. So, with another deep breath, you push forward while touching the canvas with your hand.<br />
<br />
At first it seems like transitioning into a painting is just like last time, the tingling sensation, the gooeyness of the canvas yet it doesn&#39;t really bend or move as you stick your hand inside, but something else is different this time. Your hand went right in effortlessly and your arm is able to sink into 2D so easily... You can even pull it out just as easily as well... Maybe you&#39;ll be able to get out on your own now... Amazed, you decide to keep trying to return to 2D.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Dave feels something enter his mind and give him a sense of shape... It&#39;s... it&#39;s... a hand? Wait... it has a white glove.... and a black sleeve? Is that a white ruffled collar? Wait, that&#39;s Erin&#39;s hand! Oh no... Is she trying to enter the canvas before she repaints me? What is she thinking? Dave mentally gasps as he feels himself drawn toward the 2D picture of your arm and hand, but before he can really move to possess it as his body, it disappears as you pull it from the painting and return it to 3D checking how easy it was to leave. Dave lets loose a small sigh of relief, only to be hit with a sense of excitement and pleasure once again as this time more than just your hand pushes through the barrier and is turned into a painting. Dave mentally gasps as he feels himself drawn towards the figure appearing in the painting. His very soul being drawn into the picture as it comes into being and leaps into its image as his new body. Meanwhile you push your hands, knees, face and chest into the canvas and the expected excitement seems to hit you immediately. <br />
<br />
You are stunned at how incredibly easy it is for you to return to the empty canvas and before you realize it, your already being overwhelmed with by the sensation of turning 2D as the canvas seems to be sucking you in automatically, and quickly. You barely get time to enjoy the transition as you fully succumb to orgasm and the canvas completely pulls you inside. The sensation sweeping you off your feet as you enjoy the pure orgasmic bliss overwhelming your entire body, you savor every second of your 3D-to-2D transition and after some time of enjoying your orgasmic high, you realize that you stopped transitioning a while ago and have been painted onto the canvas as a still life painting for some time... <br />
<br />
Finally coming to, you take a few minutes to gather your senses. You can see the whole scene your in in 3rd person just like before, but something else feels completely strange about your body... Like your not the only one in here... You instinctively think about Dave and try to call to him. Only for nothing inside the painting to reply, but mentally do hear something as Dave&#39;s voice seems to be speaking as your very mind. &quot;I&#39;m here, Erin...&quot; you mentally say to yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave?&quot; you ask yourself, &quot;Dave where are you?&quot; you then ask into the empty canvas world around you. &quot;Why did you choose to enter the painting without repainting me first?&quot; your own mind replies. &quot;Dave, this isn&#39;t funny, I can&#39;t see you, where are you hiding? Dave! Dave!&quot; You cry out into the empty canvas. &quot;Stop, I&#39;m right here.&quot; your mind replies. &quot;But, the only thing inside this painting is me! Where ARE you?!&quot; you cry a bit louder. &quot;Where do you think? I&#39;m you.&quot; Your mind replies. &quot;What!?!&quot; You scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Erin... Try to understand... When you entered the canvas, you turned into a painting like normal. Thing is, I was already in here and I was going to be forced to possess the first thing painted onto this canvas after I was physically erased... I told you I&#39;d be okay... I became the blank canvas itself, so anything painted onto me I would become... But now that your inside the painting... Well, you became the painting I was going to be... So now I&#39;m you... and I can feel everything your feeling and think everything your thinking... Erin... ...&quot; Your mind says before trailing off. It finally hits you what you accidentally did.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait.. we can fix this right? I can just draw you another body right? You, you can&#39;t be serious... You became ME? Dave... Why didn&#39;t you tell me that could happen!&quot; You cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn&#39;t know either, the thought only came to me after you had erased me... I was trapped inside this blank canvas until you decided to get sucked inside, now I&#39;m stuck as you... I hope this isn&#39;t permanent... Yeah... you can try painting me a new body, but with what? The only paint in here is you... And... I don&#39;t wanna think about what will happen if you try to leave this painting with me still trapped inside your body!&quot; Dave replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what am I supposed to do!? I can&#39;t just chop off my arm and use that to make you a new body... Can I?&quot; You ask Dave.</p>
