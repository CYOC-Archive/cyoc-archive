<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake shook off the strange glance from the hetero football player. He didn't really understand heterosexuals, <br />
but he sure didn't condemn them like Jason did. Wait, that wasn't right. That was how he felt about <br />
HOMOSEXUALS, because he was HETEROSEXUAL. He stopped walking and tried desperately to hang on to his grip on <br />
the real reality; however, he didn't get long to think on the subject before he was hit on the back by a <br />
powerful hand and greeted with a &quot;Hey Jake, what's up&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Jake spun around to the sight of four of his closest friends standing behind him, at least, he was pretty sure <br />
they were his friends. Going from left to right there was: Cody, a short barrel chested blond who was the <br />
schools star track player. Judd another short stocky guy, he however had brown hair and was a jack of all <br />
trades, appearing on the football team and in the schools theater programs.  Justin, a tall lanky farm boy <br />
with dark brown hair and Levi, a fairly big, fairly chunky guy, sort of hairy, the word &quot;bear&quot; now came to <br />
Jake's mind when he thought about it.<br />
<br />
The thing that threw him was  how different they all looked.<br />
<br />
Cody for one was clad in nothing but a tight pink muscle shirt, which only covered his thick meaty pecs, <br />
leaving the rest of his slight muscle gut exposed to the world, and a pair of extremely tight black Lycra sort <br />
shorts. The shorts left nothing to the imagination, Codys thick short cock clearly outlined in the black <br />
fabric. Jake's new memory kicked in and told him that this was the school's gym uniform and school colours, <br />
pink and black.<br />
<br />
Judd was dressed much the same, except he was shirtless (a valid option for gym class Jake's new memories told <br />
him)his large meaty pecs(the same size as Cody's however, they were a bit more fatty). He was now also <br />
sporting blond tips in his hair and a thick gold ring through his left nipple. His dick was also clearly <br />
visible in the school's tiny shorts, and from the looks of it, Judd was packing quiet a lot of heat. Jake <br />
licked his lips subconsciously.<br />
<br />
Justin was perhaps the most changed of the four. He had always been a skinny guy, working constantly to help <br />
support his fathers farm left him that way, skinny , but strong. It appeared that physical appearance was a <br />
bigger deal in this world however, as the Justin standing in front of him had packed on about fifty pounds of <br />
sheer muscle, muscle which was totally uninhibited by his unbuttoned cowboy style shirt. Embossed on the <br />
breast of the shirt was what at first glance looked like a man in a cowboy riding a cow;however, a closer look <br />
revealed that it was in fact a man in a cowboy hat fucking another man on his hands and knees. Instead of tiny <br />
black shorts he was instead wearing a pair of tiny daisy dukes, the back of which was embossed with the phrase <br />
&quot;Rider&quot; in large swooping letters that looked like a lasso. &quot;Damn, Justin's ass is fucking hot&quot; Jake though to <br />
himself, his dick hardening slightly<br />
<br />
Last but not least was Levi. It was almost humorous how he looked in the schools new uniform. For starters, <br />
the tiny black shorts simply could not contain that much ass, and as such his crack peeked out of the top of <br />
his shorts in all its hairy glory. The rest of the tiny garment looked as if it was having trouble holding all <br />
of Levi's giggling round ass in place. He too was wearing a tiny pink muscle shirt, but again his was <br />
stretched out by his big hairy gut and soft hairy man boobs. <br />
<br />
The entire group was slightly out of breath and glistening with sweat, which made them look even hotter &quot;Wait, <br />
no, my friends aren't hot&quot; Jake forced himself to think.<br />
<br />
Cody(the one who had slapped him on the back) had a big grin on his face &quot;Coach found out this one forgot his <br />
uniform again&quot; He said gesturing to Justin &quot;So he made us run extra laps. I was sort of pissed at first, but <br />
it gave use a good view of you flunking out with Jason again&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake would be more upset with Cody if he wasn't so right. Jason and him had been dating since freshmen year <br />
and he hadn't so much as passed first base<br />
<br />
Judd smiled right along with Cody &quot;Yeah, he's such a stick in the mud. I bet you wish you had a boyfriend like  <br />
this&quot; he said. With that he turned to Cody and slapped his ass, cupping it and squeezing tightly. He then <br />
pulled him into a deep, passionate kiss. It was a little weird to watch his two formerly straight friends to <br />
make out deeply, letting out soft moans as their tongues explored each-other's mouths. He noticed how Cody <br />
tugged abruptly on Judd's nipple ring, and how Judd moaned louder as he did. Somehow the fact that Judd was <br />
into nipple play turned Jake on even more. Judd's cock stirred in his tiny Lycra shorts and poked its pierced  <br />
head out the top. Even only half hard, Jake could see that he was right, he was packing some SERIOUS equipment <br />
down there. The piercing was just icing on an already delicious looking cake <br />
<br />
The couple pulled apart and burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you later buddy&quot; Cody said running past Jake, slapping his butt as he did, the other three following <br />
suit.<br />
<br />
Jake stood there, floored at what had happened</p>
