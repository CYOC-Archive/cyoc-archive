<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greta and Jean&#39;s magical multi-hour love making had ended in both women being purged of the humiliation and shame that Greta&#39;s young patient Joe had incurred in both of them. After they had finally taken control of the situation and lashed out at Joe&#39;s attempt to take advantage of them with his perverted goals, Jean had made an errant wish that ended up affecting the entire world, triggering the single most momentous event in human history and the extinction of the male gender in humanity. Greta and Jean were now at the former&#39;s home watching the toll of that wish on the news. <br />
<br />
The gender wave had now affected every corner of the globe, every single world leader now sporting a vagina and pair of luscious breasts, most of them feminized beyond recognition. Jean stared at the newly all female Congress and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept...for there were no more worlds to conquer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; asked Greta.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a Die Hard reference&quot; grinned Jean. &quot;It&#39;s my favorite movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The benefits of a classical education, I&#39;m sure&quot; expressed Greta sardonically, and Jean giggled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Greta in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just completed the reference. Hans Gruber says that, the benefits of a classical education. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never seen Die Hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm&quot; said Greta. &quot;I&#39;ve never been much for cinema&quot; the German psychologist responded, who was telling the truth. She was a woman very studious and serious, committed solely to her job and her studies, rarely engaging in anything fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s even funnier considering you&#39;re German&quot; added Jean, continuing to giggle.<br />
<br />
A news anchorwoman appeared on screen, reporting on the effects this world wide epidemic was having on world security and national alliances and institutions such as NATO. The news appeared grim, as the &quot;Great Change&quot;, as some people online had been calling it, was totally unprecedented and a blindside to everyone from the top down. Almost every country was blaming some combination of America, the E.U, Iran, North Korea, ISIS, Israel, the Illuminati, or simply blaming the first person they could scream at. Mass femininity had not changed the fact that human beings, deep down, were territorial and hostile to change. Our hostility had nothing to do with maleness or masculinity. It was actually an inborn trait hardwired into our psyches through countless generations of evolution. Religious institutions were surprisingly somewhat OK with the change though, except for the odd cult or three who had committed mass suicide after the change, but the obvious patriarchal flavorings of the major religions were going to have to evolve now that there were no men around. Many people were also comparing this event to a comic book series entitled &quot;Y: The Last Man&quot; where virtually every person on Earth with a Y chromosome suddenly died except for the protagonist and his pet monkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my. Look what I&#39;ve done&quot; said Jean, genuinely shocked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see that&quot; said Greta, taking Jean&#39;s magic ring which had caused this epidemic. She appropriately slid it on her left hand ring finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that every person in the world was now comfortable with their new gender and sexuality. I wish that world politics was stable, that the gender wave was accepted as inevitable and even preferable to world leaders, and finally...&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta stared at the anchorwoman, who was middle-aged and rather plain looking, realizing that all of the new women as per Jean&#39;s wish were uniformly attractive and young while many of the born women were unattractive or elderly &quot;....I wish that all women, born and new, were attractive and youthful, aged at a much slower rate than they do now, and all had toothsome figures&quot;. <br />
<br />

Logan had arrived home and taken one look at her girlified bedroom, noticing to her horror a new collection of shoes and knee high boots in her closet. She had only been sarcastic when she said that, but whoever made this wish was determined to make her a chick. Clothing was a mix of girly tops like the one she had on right now, a few skirts, but for the most part mainly tomboyish clothing. Pictures hanging on the wall were of the old Logan, the person who he was before this change had taken place. That was one thing Logan had noticed. Reality itself had seemed to change for the surge of new women, like his bedroom, but the past hadn&#39;t changed. Movies with male actors didn&#39;t suddenly have all women in them. Family photos still had fathers and sons and uncles in them, and so on, leading a fearful Logan to believe this change had been planned by someone, a human or humans with extraordinary abilities. The thought of a person with that much power frightened him. Logan didn&#39;t want to live in a world like where he could wake up one day any be a women, or a hyena, or anything that wasn&#39;t of his consent. The walls were painted in stripes, alternating pink and black. She rolled her eyes and made a beeline for the bathroom, grabbing a pair of sharp scissors to cut her hair into the short shaggy masculine she had this morning.<br />
<br />
The moment she had touched the shears thought, a thought had entered her mind. A dreadful, disturbing thought she had never once even considered until now.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is never going to go away. What if I just slit my wrists and end all the pain?&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth watched as the years had melted off the born female news anchor&#39;s face, turning the matronly veteran journalist into a fresh faced cutie who looked like she just got out of college. Turning off her bedroom TV, and giving one last look of remorse towards Robbie, who had taken this change particularly hard, she walked in her nightgown through the scarcely lit hallway to stare at herself  in the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was thirty-six years old. She was an attractive blonde woman, and had been told many times that if she just smiled more she would pass for being cute in a girl next door kind of way, but time waits for no (wo)man, and it was obvious that she had aged a little over the years she and Rob had been married. Elizabeth was a voracious reader, and one consequence of constantly having her head in a book were the little wrinkles under her eyes, not very noticeable unless you were looking for them, but they were there nonetheless. Not to mention the weight she had put on since pregnancy. The sedentary lifestyle of a stay at home mother/bookworm had filled out her body a little bit. But Elizabeth had never worried about it for one second, so why was she so self-conscious about her body NOW? It must be seeing that news anchor&#39;s transformation. Elizabeth was afraid that she would be transformed too.<br />
<br />
...Her fears were justified. Elizabeth had passed out on the tiled floor as the mileage on her body melted away and even improved. Her breasts increased a couple of cup sizes, her hips, waist and ass had conformed to a sexier and skinnier hourglass shape, her blue eyes had become brighter and more sparkling, and her face had suddenly lost those telltale wrinkles. She now looked around nineteen years old . <br />
<br />
At 12:00 A.M, little Billie had to pee, excited to find out how it would happen as a girl, and found her mother.<br />
<br />
**<br />
Allison had decided upon a red skater dress and a pair of white and pink chunky heels to wear to school tomorrow. She was going dressed to impress, and nobody was going to get between Allison and her girl! *Squee* Holding the dress up to her body, Allison giggled mirthfully, basking in the rush of new interests and hobbies her altered life had given her. As Alan, she never would have been caught dead doing this, but Allison&#39;s new mind had other ideas. Her mind was filled with romance and fairy tales and poofy ballgowns and regalia that would have made Logan disown her is she had ever found out.<br />
<br />
Allison&#39;s pink smartphone, sitting on her bed, was suddenly playing Let It Go from Frozen, a cartoon that even as Alan she had secretly really enjoyed but would never tell a soul about, especially his teammates. Excited to talk to someone for the first time as Allison other than her secret crush, Allison happily pressed the accept button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!?&quot; she asked with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison dropped the phone, her mouth gaping open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&quot; she whispered. &quot;How could I forget Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
** <br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana continued to play with one another, Millie having the time of her life. She had never once had this intimate of contact with one another. Juliana was glad to teach this shy, soft spoken young lady the finer arts of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a soft wrap at the front door of Millie&#39;s apartment was heard. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Kyle and Martha Saviano were a lovely centenarian couple who had both witnessed so much over their lives. Kyle, 101 years young, had been an extensive world traveler, and had seen African colonies gradually transform into independent nation states. He personally watched Hitler&#39;s rise to power and had rallied against the German American Bund while in his twenties before going on to do his service in the Pacific, coming home seen many horrors but also the greatest humanity has to offer. He met his wife Martha while in college on the G.I Bill, where she had worked on the UNIVAC 1, being one of the first and best women engineers of the time. In 2016, both of them had marveled at the Android phone each of them were holding, evidence of how far computational power had come. Kyle and Martha had never had children, focused entirely on their careers, but nevertheless had decades of memories. Kyle was already an old man by the time man first landed on the moon, and that was nearly fifty years ago.<br />
<br />
When the gender wave had hit, his adorable little peanut head was devoid of anything but the most wispy of white hairs. Now it was filled with luxurious and rich Italian black hair. The gender wave had transformed him into a young, slinky female version of himself that looked like she could be Martha&#39;s great-granddaughter. Martha herself had felt cheated. Kyle was young again, even if it had come at the expense of his machismo, and she would be able to live potentially for another eighty-ninety years while Martha was expecting the hit the bucket any day now. <br />
<br />
Then Greta had made her wish...<br />
