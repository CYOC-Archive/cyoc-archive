<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Tricia continued to ride Rick as she waited for the change to take place. "Any second," she thought as she bucked her hips up and down. Sex hadn't been top priority an hour ago, but now that they were in the heat of things she was aching for release. She might as well enjoy it while it lasted.
<P>Oddly, Rick's shaft was doing remarkably well. She was starting to get a lot more traction out of the small member than usual. It seemed to be growing even as she pressed herself into it.
<P>Actually, it was feeling a LOT bigger. Far too big to be normal. Suddenly it was pressing firmly against all sides of her canal, causing Tricia to moan in delight. The faint amount of concern she had over this development was pushed aside by wave after wave of newfound pleasure and she struggled to pump herself up and down on the thick shaft. She hadn't had sex like this...ever.
<P>Rick grunted louder, obviously feeling the same sensations on his end. Hearing him grunt brought her mind back, briefly, to what she had done. It had been a while since the remote went off. Why wasn't he shrinking? She was sure the remote was set properly.
<P>Then something unexpected happened. Tricia got stuck. Rick's penis was so tight inside her vagina she couldn't even move. She struggled to push away from his groin, but the more she pushed the tighter he got and the stronger the dizzying sensations became. A horror was slowly overtaking the pleasure. Something had gone wrong.
<P>Rick sensed her struggles, though his eyes were still closed. He groped her torso and then slid his hands up through her thick red hair. He grabbed onto her horns and held her head firmly against his chest as their pulsating bodies drove toward orgasm. He felt enormous, and she never remembered him being strong enough to hold her against him with that kind of force. She couldn't pull away. Meanwhile she became fully aware that her head only reached his chest, despite the fact that she was pressed flat against him and they used to be the same height.
<P>Either the remote was making him grow instead, or...or Tricia had accidentally intercepted the beam.
<P>Any concern for her situation was thrown aside once more as her tight clit prepared for orgasm. Rick beat her to it, shooting his warm seed into her. She retaliated quickly. Their reactions had never been so strong before, so amazingly wonderful. The ecstasy was so blinding she felt no concern, no worry, no pain, if only for a moment. But when that feeling faded, her fear returned stronger than ever.
<P>Rick had stopped bucking against her, but he was still clutching her horns. His breathing was rapid and heavy. They laid on the bed, limp and satisfied. At least, Rick was satisfied anyway. Tricia feared for what was coming next.
<P>She tried to lift her head, but Rick's grip wasn't letting up. She grasped his forearms with her three-fingered hands. Although his penis had softened up, it still felt enormous inside her and she had to get out before she got any smaller and it was too late.
<P>Finally, he relaxed enough so that she could look up at him. His head seemed a half mile away now. She should have been able to stare him straight in the eye.
<P>"Tricia?" he asked in disbelief.
<P>Tricia's urging tugs to his arms were finally answered as he withdrew his hands from her horns. She quickly pulled herself off his body and scrambled backwards to the foot of the bed. He looked like a giant. She turned toward her dresser, but her right arm was thrust back. She was still attached to the leash.
<P>Rick remained where he was, transfixed on seeing his very small ex-girlfriend get even smaller. Tricia tried to pry open the hook on her bracelet, but it was twice its usual size and twice as hard to open. Oddly enough, all of her accessories and jewelry was shrinking along with her, the leash being the only exception.
<P>"Tricia, what's happening to you?"
<P>Tricia was so frustrated at the turn of events, she refused to answer. Finally, she got the clasp open and slipped her bracelet out. She dropped onto the floor and ran to the dresser.
<P>Her next problem made itself known. She couldn't reach the top! She jumped and jumped, but each jump was shorter than the last.
<P>Rick stood up and cautiously approached her. "What the hell are you doing? What's going on?"
<P>"I'm shrinking, that's what's going on!" Tricia fumed. She gave up trying to get the remote and collapsed on the carpet. She pounded a fist into the floor.
<P>"What were you trying to get to the dresser for?" Rick looked around at the objects on the dresser. He spied the remote, casually hidden by two flanking picture frames. "What the heck is this thing?"
<P>"I need it. Please give it to me."
<P>Rick ignored her plea. He started reading the various buttons on the remote. Meanwhile, Tricia's vantage point continued to dwindle. She stood up and found that she was at eye-level with his knees.
<P>"This is set to shrink!" he said at last. "This is what caused it?"
<P>"I found it this morning," Tricia explained. There was no point in hiding the truth any longer. "I changed myself into a cowgirl, and I was using it to...shrink." She decided there might still be a point in hiding THAT part of the truth, though.
<P>Rick was dumbfounded. He looked from Tricia to the remote, and back. She was only a foot tall now.
<P>"Rick, you've gotta give me the remote before I disappear into nothing!"</p>
