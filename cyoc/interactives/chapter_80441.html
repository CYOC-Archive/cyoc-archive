<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was walking down a dark alley one <br />
night with my best friend, when a group <br />
of men jumped us and took us into a <br />
night club and dragged us backstage to a <br />
dressing room with a large star with the <br />
word &quot;Sapphire&quot; underneath it.&nbsp;&nbsp;They <br />
then threw us to the ground.<br />
Then, one of the men asked one of the <br />
other men, &quot;Which one of them do you <br />
think would be better suited for our <br />
goals?&quot;<br />
&quot;The one on the left would definitely <br />
change into a more attractive slave, and <br />
bring a higher sex appeal,&quot; Said the <br />
second man gesturing to me.<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; said the first man. &quot;She would <br />
undeniably make a better puppet.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you guys talking about?&quot; I <br />
asked terrified. &quot;What do you want me <br />
for, and why did you refer to me as a <br />
she?&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll find out soon enough,&quot; said the <br />
first man.<br />
&quot;What about the other one?&quot; asked the <br />
second man.<br />
&quot;Another sex slave could sure bring in <br />
some extra cash,&quot; replied the first man, <br />
at which point his guards dragged my <br />
friend out of the room, and I would <br />
never see him again.<br />
&quot;The show starts in an hour, so let's get <br />
this over with,&quot; said the first man pulling <br />
out a rather large and strange remote <br />
that he then pointed at me.<br />
&quot;Smile,&quot; he said pushing a button on the <br />
device.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I felt a strange sensation creep <br />
down my body, changing me.<br />
My neck length hair was the first thing to <br />
change. It began to grow, then reaching <br />
my shoulders and straightening. When it <br />
reached my lower back it changed from <br />
brown, to bleach blonde.<br />
Suddenly, my face began to itch terribly, <br />
and scratching didn't help, as my facial <br />
hair disappeared and my skin softened. <br />
Then I felt my facial bones crack and <br />
shift as my face changed shape. Then, I <br />
felt my eyes slant, giving me an exotic <br />
look, and my lips swell becoming pouty. <br />
Soon my face looked like that of a <br />
Hollywood bimbo.<br />
Then my neck thinned and my shoulders <br />
became small a little more rounded at <br />
the edges. My arms slimmed and curved <br />
becoming delicate as my hands <br />
decreased in size, becoming soft and <br />
feminine as my finger nails grew.<br />
I then realized that my voice was a <br />
higher pitch when I screamed out in pain <br />
because my stomach and waist were <br />
pulling inwards into an hour glass shape. <br />
My stomach and torso thinned and <br />
becoming smooth and firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried out <br />
again as my hip bones cracked, <br />
restructuring themselves in a slightly <br />
larger and more feminine shape.<br />
I then felt an odd pressure on my chest, <br />
as if my flesh was pushing outward. <br />
Looking down, I saw to large mounds <br />
swell on my chest until I had two large, <br />
D-cup breasts poking through my shirt <br />
and moving aside the sides of my jacket. <br />
I grabbed, held, and squeezed my newly <br />
formed boobs in shock and terror as I <br />
realized what these men were doing to <br />
me.<br />
&quot;This isn't happening, this isn't <br />
happening, this isn't happening; I don't <br />
want to be a girl,&quot; I chanted to myself in <br />
a feminine voice that couldn't possibly of <br />
been my own.<br />
Then I felt most of my body itch <br />
intensely as all of my bodies' excess hair <br />
dissolved. My legs began to feel sore as if <br />
I had run for a very long time as they <br />
reshaped themselves into a more <br />
feminine shape. My thighs rounded and <br />
became smooth and slanted as my calves <br />
and lower legs became small, smooth, <br />
and slanted as well.<br />
Suddenly, my whole body began to feel <br />
hotter and hotter as if I were lying in the <br />
sun, and when I looked down, I saw that <br />
my very pale skin was tanning itself. <br />
When it was finished, I had a deep tan <br />
that made me look as if I were from <br />
someplace sunny like California.<br />
Then, the final and worst part of the <br />
transformation occurred. I began to feel <br />
a massive tugging on my genitals as they <br />
slowly receded into my skin. I grabbed at <br />
my groin in shock and pain, only to feel <br />
my manhood sink in deeper and deeper.<br />
&quot;No, oh god no; don't turn me into a <br />
girl!&quot; I screamed in a very feminine voice, <br />
keeping hold of my genitals in vain until <br />
they made a sudden gurgling, slurping <br />
noise as they completely disappeared <br />
into my soft, tan flesh.<br />
I then spread my legs, but kept them <br />
locked at the knees as I screamed out in <br />
agony as a hole tore itself open below <br />
my now empty groin. The pain proved <br />
too much and I fell unconscious, a newly <br />
born slutty looking girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I awoke ten minutes later only to find <br />
myself completely unable to move sitting <br />
in a chair with a team of attractive <br />
women who were barely dressed styling <br />
my blonde hair, and plastering makeup <br />
onto my face.<br />
&quot;She's, like, awake sirs,&quot; said one of the <br />
slutty women, turning my chair to face <br />
the men.<br />
One of the men got right in my face, and <br />
examined my features carefully. I tried <br />
desperately to spit into the face of one of <br />
the men that had turned me into a girl, <br />
but I was unable to move.<br />
Then, without warning, he grabbed my <br />
breasts and began fondling them. I tried <br />
to fight the intense pleasure coursing <br />
through my system, but I found that I <br />
couldn't and I let out a rather loud <br />
moan.<br />
Then, a voice in my head said,&nbsp;&quot;I'm such <br />
a hawt little toy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why did I just think that?&quot;&nbsp;I thought to <br />
myself.&quot;I'm not a hot little toy.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
The voice resurfaced and said,&quot;&nbsp;Like, <br />
duh, ur totally a hawt little toy; don't <br />
deny it.&quot;<br />
Before I could argue with myself further, <br />
the man fondling me said, &quot;You're just <br />
perfect. Let's see how far we can get you <br />
to go. &quot;<br />
He then took his left hand, still toying <br />
with one of my breasts with his right, and <br />
grabbed my face at which point he stuck <br />
his tongue in my mouth. The pleasure <br />
began to reach an extreme high, and I <br />
could not control my body or mind any <br />
longer, and I wrapped my left leg around <br />
his torso, and brought him in closer, and <br />
I ran my hands down his clothed chest.<br />
The voice re-surfaced saying,&quot;&nbsp;I'm such a <br />
ravishing little hotty; ooh, I hope he, like, <br />
ravishes me; that would be, like, totally <br />
hawt.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
The pleasure was overwhelming my <br />
mind, so I had no energy to mentally <br />
argue with the voice, and I let it take <br />
over so she could have her way with the <br />
man.<br />
&quot;That's enough, Johnson,&quot; said the first <br />
man. &quot;Our new girl has a show in an <br />
hour, and she certainly could not use a <br />
mind wipe right now. we do not have her <br />
new personality designed yet. Just have <br />
your way with any of these other slaves if <br />
you're that intent on it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; said Johnson releasing me.<br />
&quot;Bummer&quot;, said the voice.<br />
&quot;But the second we have this one's <br />
personality designed, I want to be the <br />
one to wipe her mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine, but for right now, let's get her <br />
ready for the show,&quot; said the first man.<br />
&quot;Alright, 'Sapphire,' it's time to put this <br />
on,&quot; said Johnson, pulling out a skimpy <br />
little number that consisted of nothing <br />
but a corset with a breast piece, blue <br />
panties, white leggings, and black high-<br />
heels.<br />
I tried to scream no, but the men still <br />
had control of me, so I began to slowly <br />
strip. I started by taking off my shoes. <br />
Then I stood and took off my jacket, <br />
which exposed my small frame. I looked <br />
down and saw my breast stretching out <br />
my shirt, and thought, Let this stop. I <br />
don't want to be their daft female slave.<br />
Then the voice responded saying,&quot;&nbsp;Like, <br />
why would we want this to stop? We're a <br />
sexy babe; this is, like, totally going to be <br />
sooo much fun.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
Then I reached down, and tore off my <br />
shirt, exposing my tender breasts, and <br />
toned frame to the warm air. Finally, I <br />
slid my pants and boxers off, leaving me <br />
a completely naked woman. I shyly <br />
blushed.<br />
Johnson pushed a button and forced me <br />
to look into a mirror.<br />
I was beautiful, sexy, and somewhat <br />
vacant looking. I looked like a total <br />
bimbo.<br />
&quot;How is this possible? I asked myself. <br />
How did they turn me into this <br />
voluptuous beauty?&quot;<br />
&quot;This isn't my body, I'm a gu&quot;...I looked at <br />
my tender breasts, and gently grabbed <br />
them and began to play with them. <br />
Suddenly, the voice took complete <br />
control of me once more and said, ...&quot;rl. <br />
I'm a hawt little cutey, te-he.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
I tried to reassert myself and said,&quot;&nbsp;No, <br />
I'm a&quot;...I rubbed my legs together, <br />
feeling the newfound emptiness between <br />
them.<br />
&quot;Gurl, and a total babe at that.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
&quot;What's happening to me!?&nbsp;&quot;I screamed <br />
in my mind as I began to put on the <br />
outfit.<br />
&quot;Guy, guy, guy, guy&quot;... My head was <br />
pounding, and it felt like a fog was rolling <br />
over my brain.<br />
I pulled on the blue panties, and felt <br />
them brush against the emptiness and <br />
my newfound femininity.<br />
&quot;Gurl! I'm a hawt chick; there's no <br />
denying it. Just look at my hawt bod. I <br />
mean, why would I want to be a guy <br />
when I'm this totally hawt; I'm Aphrodite <br />
herself.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
I felt like I was losing complete control of <br />
myself as the estrogen ravaged my mind.<br />
&quot;Stop it, please! You're a guy, not a girl. A <br />
guy, not a girl&quot;...<br />
Then I pulled on the white leggings, <br />
filling them fit snugly over my luscious <br />
legs.<br />
&quot;A guy, not a gurl. A guy, not a gurl&quot;...<br />
Then I pulled on the corset, feeling it pull <br />
my waist in and squeeze my boobs.<br />
&quot;A totally gross boy, not a hawt, luscious <br />
gurl. A disgusting man, not a ravishing <br />
babe.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
Then I strapped on the high heels and <br />
looked at the finished product in the <br />
mirror. The woman staring back at me <br />
was a skimpily clad babe. The image of <br />
myself looking that gorgeous completely <br />
overloaded my mind.<br />
&quot;I'm such a hawt little bunny, not a <br />
totally use-able man. A gurl, not a guy.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
The estrogen had completely re-written <br />
my mind. Now I was physically, and <br />
mentally, a daft bimbo.<br />
I giggled shyly, ready for my show.<br />
<br />
The next two weeks passed by in a blur. <br />
I, for some odd reason, kept performing <br />
slightly erotic shows for sold out bars <br />
and clubs until, mentally, I began to <br />
slowly reassert myself. It happened <br />
slowly, but at the end of week one, I was <br />
mentally myself again, although they still <br />
had control of my body and kept me <br />
doing shows for large groups of patrons.<br />
This was how they made money, they <br />
kidnapped men, changed them, and used <br />
them in portable brothels and erotic <br />
song and dance shows, and I was the <br />
new star because they sold the last one <br />
to a wealthy benefactor.<br />
I awoke one morning two weeks after <br />
they had changed me and looked in the <br />
mirror directly above my bed on the <br />
ceiling. I was still a girl; it had not been a <br />
twisted dream. I looked different, <br />
though. When they had first changed me, <br />
I had had blonde hair, big lips, big <br />
breasts,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue eyes, and a vacant look in <br />
said eyes; I had looked like a slut. Now, <br />
my hair had reverted to its natural <br />
brown, my proportions had become a <br />
little smaller, my eyes had become their <br />
natural brown, and my features looked <br />
less slutty. To be honest, I looked like a <br />
female version of my normal self.<br />
None of that mattered, though; I was still <br />
their puppet. Frustrated, I said, &quot;When is <br />
this nightmare going to end!?&quot;<br />
I closed my mouth, shocked. At that <br />
point, I realized that I could control my <br />
own voice, and talk of my own accord.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <br />
lay there, in the room they assigned me <br />
in their massive tour bus, unable to <br />
move, but able to talk. I didn't know how <br />
I could use this to my advantage, not yet <br />
anyhow, but I could only assume that <br />
their control of me was dependent on <br />
the initial shock of my change, and that's <br />
why they kept a mirror above my bed, <br />
and, now that I was more aware of and <br />
used to my situation, their control of me <br />
was wearing off.<br />
I laughed in the beautiful voice they had <br />
given me. Soon, if I played along and let <br />
them think I was still their puppet, I'd be <br />
able to control my whole body and be <br />
able to flee. I'd still be a girl, but at least <br />
I'd be able to make a life for myself <br />
outside of being the star attraction at a <br />
traveling brothel.<br />
My hopes were instantly dashed when <br />
Johnson stormed into the room.<br />
&quot;Your mental reprogramming collar is <br />
finished!&quot; He said, excitedly brandishing <br />
a sinister looking metallic collar.<br />
&quot;If I put this marvel of science on your <br />
neck, and get enough estrogen pumping <br />
through your system, then it should <br />
inject you with enough chemicals to <br />
permanently change your personality <br />
and physical appearance. In other words, <br />
you'll be ours forever.&quot;<br />
I tried to move my body, to get up and <br />
run, but it was no use, they still had too <br />
much control over me. I started crying, <br />
realizing my fate.<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this to me!?&quot; I <br />
screamed out through tears.<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, you can talk. I suppose that <br />
was bound to happen. The initial massive <br />
estrogen rush your body put through <br />
your system should be wearing off by <br />
now, and you should be regaining some <br />
semblance of physical control. But that <br />
doesn't matter, sexy, because after I <br />
have sex with you, you will never be able <br />
to escape?&quot;<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; I screamed in shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, <br />
please, don't do this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes, please do do this, johnsy-<br />
poo.&quot;&nbsp;Said the feminine voice inside of <br />
me.<br />
&quot;But dear, I have to, how do you think <br />
we're going to get enough estrogen <br />
pumping through your system unless I <br />
have sex with you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, please god no! Stop this, oh god, let <br />
this nightmare end.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, but baby,&quot; Johnson said getting on <br />
the bed and hovering over me, &quot;This is a <br />
not a nightmare, this is going to be fun.&quot; <br />
And he snapped the collar onto my neck, <br />
and, before I could object further, he <br />
stuck his tongue in my mouth.<br />
I instantly became aroused, and the <br />
voice in my head began reasserting itself <br />
again.<br />
&quot;Oh, baby, this is going to be, like, so <br />
hawt&quot;, It said.<br />
&quot;This isn't happening, this isn't <br />
happening, this isn't happening&quot;, I <br />
chanted in my mind.<br />
Johnson flung the covers off of my body, <br />
exposing how I was only wearing a bra <br />
and panties. Then he began toying with <br />
my breast, and the collar injected me <br />
with something as I became aroused, <br />
and my breasts increased in size.<br />
I ran my hands down his thighs, taking <br />
off his pants, as he began unstrapping <br />
my bra.<br />
&quot;But, darling, this is happening, and it's <br />
going to be, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;sooooo good. Just <br />
accept it; you're a gurl now, and sex is <br />
hawt.&quot;&nbsp;The voice said, again.<br />
&quot;No, I'm a guy! I must try to mentally <br />
stay myself! Maybe I can still get out of <br />
this.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
He tore off my bra, exposing my breast <br />
to the cool air, and ran his hands down <br />
my hips, and slid off my panties.<br />
&quot;No, ur a total gurl, just accept it, and let <br />
this hawt sex get on the road.&quot;<br />
I fought with myself, internally, and <br />
managed to say in my mind,<br />
&quot;I... am a ... GUY! They can't take that <br />
away from me.&nbsp;&quot;<br />
I slid off his boxers.<br />
I am...<br />
Then he stuck his male parts into my <br />
feminine ones, and it was all over.<br />
&quot;GUUUUUURL!&quot; I moaned very loudly, <br />
and the collar injected me one more <br />
time, and my hair changed from brown <br />
to a blue.<br />
I ran my legs up his body, letting him <br />
stick me repeatedly as he toyed with my <br />
breast, and I ran my hands over his <br />
body, and kissed him repeatedly.<br />
&quot;A LUSCIOUS BABE,&quot;I moaned. &quot;I'M A <br />
HAWT, GURL!&quot;<br />
I wrapped my legs around his body, and <br />
pulled him into me repeatedly. The collar <br />
injected me two more times, and I felt <br />
my mind fuzz over, permanently, and my <br />
features change, to become more exotic, <br />
and more vacant.<br />
I pulled him into me repeatedly, and he <br />
fell into me repeatedly. The entire <br />
process was so arousing, I had <br />
completely lost myself to it. The&nbsp;&nbsp;process <br />
reached a massive climax of arousal five <br />
minutes later, at which point the collar <br />
injected me one more time, and I <br />
moaned, &quot;I AM A… GURL!&quot;<br />
And then it was over, forever, he fell off <br />
of me, and I stared at the ceiling and <br />
giggled. I was a girl now, physically and <br />
mentally, and their permanent sex toy, <br />
but my new daft, female mind didn't <br />
have any complaints, in fact she was <br />
excited for it.<br />
Ten minutes later, I looked at Johnson <br />
and said, in an erotic voice pouting my <br />
lips, &quot;let's go again Johnsy-poo,&quot;<br />
He laughed and said, &quot;sure thing, my <br />
vivacious new doll.&quot; He then rolled back <br />
on top of me and started the amazing <br />
process all over again, and then I happily <br />
accepted my new fate, this, was, like, <br />
going to be soooo much fun!</p>
