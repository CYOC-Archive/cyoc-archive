<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then, Jeff remembered something else. He hadn&#39;t heard anything from his friend Sam since before the trip to the antique shop.<br />
He pulled up his phone&#39;s contact list and scrolled to Sam&#39;s number. Hesitantly, he pressed the &quot;call&quot; button.<br />
It rang. Once. Twice. On the third ring, Jeff&#39;s best friend picked up.<br />
&quot;Hey babe! Are you out of the hospital yet? Feeling better?&quot;<br />
Babe? Jeff&#39;s face turned a bright red.<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, just got out. Still kind of sore, but the doctors said the pain will go away with time.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s awesome! Do you want me to swing by and pick you up later tonight? I&#39;ll bring some painkillers and a big bottle of water and we can go for a drive or something?&quot;<br />
So the Jeff in this reality had been dating Sam. This was a nightmare.<br />
&quot;S-sure.&quot;<br />
&quot;See you in an hour.&quot;<br />
The line clicked off.<br />
Jeff lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling. His thoughts were all a blur. His best friend was his boyfriend. His dick was gone. The Jeff in this reality had done his damnedest to make this happen and now he was the one stuck with the consequences.<br />
An hour later, Jeff heard the familiar sound of Sam&#39;s car pulling up in the driveway.<br />
He shuffled out to the car, still unsteady on his feet. Sam was waiting for him, leaning against the car and giving him a grin and a thumbs up.<br />
&quot;Still a little wobbly, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
Sam pulled him into a hug.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get your legs back, just give it time.&quot;<br />
Jeff tried to pull away. He was all too aware of the absence in his crotch.<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, hop in. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll treat you to an early dinner and then take you to a movie. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen you and I want to spend as much time as possible with my sweetie.&quot;<br />
Sam gave Jeff a kiss on the forehead. Jeff wanted to be disgusted but was distracted by his friend’s muscular chest. He never noticed how well Sam’s muscles filled out his athletic t-shirts.<br />
As Jeff sat down, the seat pressed his tender parts uncomfortably, causing him to let out a squeak.<br />
Sam laughed and put a hand on Jeff&#39;s shoulder.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got you, man. I brought extra pillows thinking you’d probably be tender still.” He handed Jeff one of those neck pillows for the airplane.<br />
As Sam pulled out of the driveway and headed towards the main road, he put a hand on Jeff&#39;s thigh.<br />
&quot;So I was thinking, after the movie, we could head over to my place and I can give you a nice massage. Help you get used to walking again.&quot;<br />
Jeff gulped. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to reject the offer.<br />
&quot;O-okay.&quot;<br />
As they drove through town, Jeff&#39;s mind was a jumble of confusing thoughts. He was a normal, straight guy, or at least that&#39;s what he had always told himself. But then, why was he feeling a warmth growing between his legs as Sam&#39;s strong hand caressed his thighs. Why did it feel so right when his friend called him his &quot;sweetheart&quot; and treated him like his special prince? Why did his heart flutter a bit when Sam gave him a smile or a reassuring pat on the shoulder?<br />
Was it the new anatomy, or had his feelings for his friend always been there?<br />
Jeff&#39;s thoughts were interrupted when they arrived at the movie theater.<br />
&quot;What kind of movie do you want to see? Action, horror, comedy, romance?&quot;<br />
Jeff thought about it. He&#39;d never really thought about going to the movies with a guy.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I guess something romantic would be fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? Something that&#39;s just us two would be nice. How about the late night showing of Love on the Clock Tower? I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s great.&quot;<br />
Sam gave Jeff a smile.<br />
Jeff blushed and smiled back.<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sweet! Let&#39;s grab our tickets, I&#39;ve got popcorn and snacks already waiting in the car.&quot;<br />
The two men got their tickets and entered the theater.<br />
It was pretty empty. Aside from them, the only other person in the audience was an old man, fast asleep in one of the front row seats.<br />
Sam led Jeff to a couple of empty seats near the back and the two sat down.<br />
Jeff felt a bit nervous as Sam put his arm around his shoulder and drew him closer. He felt Sam&#39;s warm breath on his ear and his soft lips pressed gently against the nape of his neck.<br />
&quot;Just relax and try to enjoy the movie.&quot; Sam whispered.<br />
Jeff was startled, but the warm feeling from earlier returned and he melted into his boyfriend&#39;s embrace.<br />
&quot;O-okay.&quot; he quietly stammered.<br />
As the movie began, Jeff felt his friend&#39;s strong hand gently rub his arm and shoulders, then his hand slowly drifted lower.<br />
&quot;Your shirt is cute.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jeff blushed, &quot;I like yours too.&quot;<br />
Sam grinned.<br />
&quot;You wanna borrow it?&quot;<br />
Jeff smiled. He could barely follow the plot of the movie at this point. All he could think about was Sam.<br />
“Sure”<br />
Sam unbuttoned his shirt and took it off. He helped Jeff remove his own shirt and slid his onto his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;It looks good on you.&quot;<br />
Jeff blushed and buried his face in his boyfriend&#39;s bare chest. Sam&#39;s musky scent was intoxicating.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;<br />
&quot;You want a kiss, babe?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
Sam cupped his hands around Jeff&#39;s chin and gave him a slow, deep, passionate kiss.<br />
Jeff had kissed girls before, but never a guy. He was surprised at how much better it was than anything he&#39;d experienced. Sam&#39;s rough stubble and soft lips, his strong arms holding him tight, and his muscular chest pressing against him.<br />
Jeff moaned softly and put his hands around Sam&#39;s waist. He felt a growing heat between his legs, and the gentle ache that had persisted ever since the operation began to melt away.<br />
They were both lost in the moment.<br />
Sam ran his hand down Jeff&#39;s back, resting it on the small of his back.<br />
&quot;How far are we gonna go? I&#39;m happy either way, and I&#39;ll understand if you need to take it slow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take it slow.&quot; Jeff replied, &quot;I- I&#39;m not really sure what to do yet.&quot;<br />
Sam nodded.<br />
&quot;Got it. You&#39;re in good hands, just tell me if I start doing anything that hurts.&quot;<br />
He began to unbutton Jeff&#39;s pants.<br />
&quot;I want to make you feel good.&quot;<br />
As he pulled the zipper down, Jeff could feel the gentle brush of Sam&#39;s fingertips against his groin, sending a tingling sensation up his spine.<br />
Sam looked at him and gave a smile.<br />
&quot;Lift your hips for me, babe.&quot;<br />
Jeff did so and Sam pulled down his pants, letting them fall to the floor. He ran his fingers across the thin fabric of Jeff&#39;s underwear, feeling his soft pussy.<br />
Jeff let out a little gasp as Sam&#39;s finger traced its way up his slit. He leaned forward and kissed Jeff again, his tongue sliding into his mouth. “I was worried I was gonna miss your dick but this is a lot better. It&#39;ll be so easy to get inside of you now.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt a bit embarrassed, but his arousal overpowered his embarrassment.<br />
Sam slipped his hand into Jeff&#39;s underwear, his fingers brushing against his boyfriend&#39;s sensitive clit.<br />
Jeff gasped. It felt so much different than the doctor had during his recovery. He leaned into his boyfriend, burying his face in his shoulder.<br />
&quot;Sam.&quot; he moaned.<br />
Sam kept going.<br />
Jeff began to grind against his hand, letting out a soft moan.<br />
&quot;Oh, Sam.&quot;<br />
He was so wet now.<br />
Sam slipped a finger into Jeff&#39;s pussy, moving it slowly in and out.<br />
Jeff could feel the walls of his new vagina squeezing it tightly. He felt like his body was on fire.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really tight, babe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nngh&quot; was the only reply Jeff could manage. It was way too sensitive.<br />
Sam slowly slipped another finger into his boyfriend, moving his thumb up and down across his clit.<br />
The pleasure was too much, the orgasm ripped through his body, his vagina spasming uncontrollably around Sam&#39;s fingers. He held his boyfriend tightly, his whole body trembling.<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot; Sam whispered, planting a kiss on his neck.<br />
&quot;Fuck the movie. Let&#39;s get back to my place, babe.”<br />
Sam pulled his hand out of Jeff&#39;s underwear, wiping his fingers on the seat cushion.<br />
Jeff&#39;s breathing was heavy. He nodded.<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot;<br />
The two quickly gathered their things and made their way out of the theater, heading for the car.</p>
