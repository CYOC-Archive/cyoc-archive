<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I sighed since I knew I'd just end up back here if I exited the cyber world and came back in. Their assertion that there was radiation in 
that world could be valid. After all we were only there for maybe five minutes and didn't see any animals, just the tracks. It didn't matter 
though since I wasn't going to leave without Tina and I had no idea where she was at the moment. I looked at my body again and thought 
it looked younger though that could just be looks. "How old am I?" I muttered wondering.</p>
<p>"Why you're fourteen Princess," the demoness said with a smile that creeped me out. "While we're waiting for the mers to pay the 
ransom that should have been delivered by now we have another way to make money off of you. Open the door Cecil."</p>
<p>As Cecil moved closer with the same type of smile I tried thinking of how to escape. I shouldn't have a problem with Cecil since he was 
so small but the demoness was another matter. If she was by herself I might have been able to get past her. Unfortunately Cecil was the 
one that would open the door and the demoness looked like she was ready for me to try and escape. I thought I had a chance of escape 
but I'd have to time it right and it depended on where Cecil decided to stand when he opened the door. As luck would have it he stood in 
the open door and said, "Now no funny stuff. We're ready for whatever you might try. Just come along with us quietly and you might enjoy 
what we have planned."</p>
<p>Cecil's grin was enough to tell me that I probably wouldn't enjoy what they had planned even if I did cooperate. So pretending to go 
along I walked forward a bit and then kicked Cecil in the groin to which there was an enjoyable scream of pain and doubling over. I didn't 
let him fall to the ground though as I grabbed the front of his shirt and pushed him into the demoness. I hoped that she would expect me to 
try and run past now so that's what I pretended to do. However just as I was passing her I swung around to hit her. She seemed to have 
expected this though and grabbed my arm pulling me off balance then twisting it behind my back. The demoness bent close to my ear and 
said, "That wasn't very nice princess. Now Cecil won't get to enjoy you which is a shame since he really wanted to. You know what else? I 
could have made it so you would definitely enjoy all the males who want to have you but now it won't be a sure thing. I don't know if you'll 
enjoy yourself or not but we'll find out. Now walk."</p>
<p>I thought about trying to get away again but the demoness had a strong grip on me so there was no way I could get out of it. Besides if 
I tried she could push my arm up causing me some pain thus effectively controlling me. As she led me down a hallway I had to wonder 
how sore I was going to be. I knew that most males in this type of setting don't care about the female's comfort, they're only interested in 
satisfying their own sexual urges. I didn't want to be raped but it looked like it was going to happen. We came to a door that slid open on a 
short hallway with another door at the end. It reminded me of an airlock and we stepped into it. Once the first door closed the second 
opened and the demoness pushed me into the room saying, "Have fun Princess."</p>
<p>I looked around the room and shuddered at what I saw. I didn't know what all of the stuff in here did exactly but I had the suspicion that 
it was all related to BDSM. I heard the door open behind me and turned around to see a merman. Like me he didn't have any clothes on. 
He did have a pouch tied around his waist like I did. His scales though were a blue so deep that they appeared to be black and his cock 
was fully erect. "Well I haven't had a mermaid since I was banished," he said with a big grin. "I'll definitely enjoy myself."</p>
<p>I gulped and asked in a shaky voice, "Why were you banished?"</p>
<p>"Oh the usual," he said waving his hand as if to brush off my question. His grin widened as he said, "Though you may be able to help 
me take over the kingdom."</p>
<p>"Why would I help you do that?" I asked anger in my voice.</p>
<p>"Oh mer law says that the one who gets a princess pregnant can assume the throne provided there are no other contenders," he said 
with a gleam in his eyes. "Of course if there are other contenders then there's a battle to the death. I'm sure I can win any battle. At least if 
I do get you pregnant you better hope I do win."</p>
<p>"Why is that?" I asked a little fear creeping into my voice.</p>
<p>"Because if I lose you'll be stripped of your title and banished along with me," he said then laughed. After a moment he quit and said, 
"That would be a sight to see. The king and queen of the mers stripping their new daughter of her title and banishing her. Oh I really hope 
that I get you pregnant. It would be worth losing just to see that. Of course I don't plan on losing when it comes to the battle."</p>
<p>As son as he was done speaking he grabbed my hair and almost dragged me to a little table that had straps on it. Forcing me down on 
it he put a strap across my neck and tightened it down. He took my right arm and strapped it down on a leg of the table. While he was 
doing that I tried to unbuckle the strap on my neck but before I was able to he pulled my other arm down and secured it. He bent down 
and smiled at me before going behind me and strapping my legs down and apart so that he'd have easy access to my vagina. I could feel 
his cock against my lips and then he thrust into me. I cried out in pain though he didn't care. He just kept pounding away until I felt his cock 
spasm and he came inside me. With a smile in his voice he said, "I paid for a few hours and I recover quickly so we'll have quite a bit of 
fun ahead of us."</p>
<p>After the third time I didn't feel the pain anymore. I still didn't want it but my body started responding and I began to feel pleasure. This 
wasn't going to be good for my psyche and any sane person would exit the cyber world. So I must be insane for staying in the cyber world 
but then again I didn't want to die. I had to hope that my psyche wouldn't be damaged too badly. Maybe someone will interrupt us and this 
will be cut short.</p></p>
