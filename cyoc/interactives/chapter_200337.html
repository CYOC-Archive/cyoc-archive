<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Codename Pool-Toy... Pool... Toy...? Melissa blinked, then read it again before mulling over the choice of words and attempting to parse it in a way that didn&#39;t associate it with literal pool-toys, then blanking as she considered the seeming insanity behind all this nonsense.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, the fuck, have I, gotten myself, into...&quot; Melissa worded at a barely-audible volume. Of course, Melissa was aware that codenames could mean more or less anything but with all the crazy shit she&#39;d just seen it could very well be literal. Could these people even be called human? Melissa shook her head to rid herself of the countless questions and looked around, seeing she wasn&#39;t the only one to delay their departure to whatever part of this massive freakshow they were assigned to. Though, if being turned into walking expressions of someones kink was what they did to &#39;Volunteers&#39; she didn&#39;t want to think of what they did to traitors.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, mellissa looked back to her papers to read past the name to find that Project Pool-Toy was indeed about nautical missions and operations where the operative would require to travel via the ocean. And through further inspection Melissa could comfortably say, that according to what she was given about the project that there were no indications about her being turned into anything resembling a pool-toy. So with a relieved sigh she found the facility map and got on her way to probably never be human again, and why was she feeling some kind of perverted excitement about that!?<br />
<br />
The path to Project Pool-Toy was admittedly short and Melissa felt some measure of relief that she wasn&#39;t alone here. Inside what appeared to be a waiting room Melissa found herself standing with 5 other women, two Brits from the SAS, a russian Spetsnaz and a Japanese from the JSDF, and, to Melissas joy and surprise a fellow American who, of course, looked to be of the Navy SEALS according to her uniform. The look on the womans face told Melissa she was also equally suprised and relieved at a fellow American joining her in this, and determined to atleast introduce herself to her fellow Freedom-Lover Melissa made to walk over to her, unfortunately before she could even open her mouth to speak the waiting rooms door abruptly opened audibly.<br />
<br />
Entering the room was a tall and lanky man with stereotypically large glasses for a scientist, a look only further emphasized by the white labcoat on his body and the clipboard in his hands, his light-brown hair looked completely ignored with long light-brown curls done into a wild and unkempt ponytail. Immediately after entering the scientist visibly took in the waiting rooms other occupants and Melissa could feel his green-brown eyes inspect her uniform. Whoever this man was had the &#39;emotionless scientist&#39; look down pat with the blank, almost bored, expression on his face as he quickly wrote something down after his brief survey of the room before nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone&#39;s here, then lets begin, welcome to the project codenamed Pool-Toy. Im the projects lead researcher Hadrian Amundsen and I&#39;ll be giving you a view of just what our project has to offer you ladies. Pool-Toy seeks to give the operatives of the Rubber Corps a nautical capability and grant you superiority over the seas-&quot; Melissa couldn&#39;t help but stare at how he spoke as if reading off a script in the most disinterested tone she had ever heard, she guessed he probably was reading off a script but then she had to give the guy props for seemingly memorising something he sounded as if he couldn&#39;t care less for. Then the 6 staring soldiers shifted their sight from the completely disinterested man to the newcomer that suddenly bowled into the conversation from beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you may experience the glory of the seven seas! To strike fear into the hearts of twisted men as they stare down your mighty gullet! To save the lifes of many a innocent from the schemes of the dastardly elite of this world! Pleasing yourself with the untold gratitude of everyone ever being saved from fear and terror! And, most important of all! To feel the rush of water, gliding across your rubbery skin! So be honoured, mortals! For you have been chosen to guard me! Your princess! With your wills of steel and mighty curves!&quot; The newcomer declared with an ostentatious flair befitting of an overdramatic child, and if it wasn&#39;t for her appearance, Melissa would have immediately assumed she was someones child here, an assumption which would have begged the question &quot;What the hell was a child doing here?&quot;.<br />
<br />
When Melissa saw her, she had immediately gone to rub her eyes, disbelieving of what she was seeing. For there, aside the interrupted professor Hadrian, stood what looked like a near-nude child. A child with moist sea-green skin of rubber, a pair of sparkling amethyst eyes, a mouthful of dangerous looking pearl-white teeth shown off in a gleeful grin that was perhaps just a little too wide. Instead of normal hair (or even &#39;fake&#39; hair), a couple long tentacles sat atop her head, and even more tentacles waved behind her, sprouting from her back while several stubby tentacles sprouted from her hips. Devoid of any clothes, the only measure of modesty the girl had was a wide strap of vantablack rubbery fabric -like you&#39;d see swimwear made of-, that covered her oddly pronounced pair of breasts while leaving her crotch bare for all to see. All the while thankfully her vagina (if she even had one) was hidden by the angle Melissa had of her.<br />
<br />
Processing the torrent of words &#39;she&#39; spouted took a hot second before leaving Melissa still equally as puzzled as to &quot;what is she doing here?&quot; while simultaniously supplying credence to her theory that, yes, the girl *is actually a child*. A theory that then sprouted *more* questions in the form of *what the fuck is a child in this place* and *why the fuck has a child been made a latex thing*. Impulsively, Melissa turned her head and made eye-contact with the Navy SEALS operative beside her, exchanging a look of shock and confusion with her fellow american woman before turning the other way and seeing that every other woman here were also exchanging looks of utter shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mirabel, could you go find doctor Fars?&quot; Hadrian suddenly said in his seemingly dead tone, though a quick glance made Melissa do a double-take as mister &#39;emotionless scientist&#39;s&#39; lips had quirked upwards into an almost imperceptible smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Came the firm reply as Mirabel made a pout at the far taller man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mirabel.&quot; Hadrian said in a more firm, father-tone -still not even seeming to glance her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said no! I want to see them this time, everyone keeps saying today will be a &#39;big day&#39; and I want to see it!&quot; Mirabel insisted with crossed arms and a stern pout up at Hadrian, her tentacles seeming a little agitated in their swaying movement, letting Melissa notice their oddly black undersides where the suction cups would be on a squid, except her shorter thigh tentacles which were without features with exception to the oddly blunt tips. <br />
<br />
In pure contrast, professor Hadrian had barely moved since first entering the waiting room, though now his head had cocked to give Mirabel a sideways look, and this was the state in which they found themselves for multiple rather awkward moments of silence where nobody dared breathe. Finally the silence was broken by Hadrians smile growing bigger before he straightened up his head with a miniscule sigh, in response Mirabel grinned and let out a celebratory &#39;Yay!&#39;, her tentacles splaying out and her arms shooting up before she darted forward and gave Hadrians waist a quick hug before pulling back with a wide smile on her oddly expressive face. Melissas attention was returned to the professor when he made an audible cough, the smile gone, leaving his face emotionless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, im certain the projects goals for its agents, and by extension you, has been explained clearly enough. Even if not by exactly &#120373;&#120361;&#120368;&#120372;&#120358; metrics. If you&#39;ll follow me we&#39;ll get started on giving you your specialized forms for nautical operations.&quot; Professor Hadrian said before turning sharply and walking back through the door, the still smiling Mirabel quickly darted past Hadrian and disappeared past the door from Melissas sight. Following, Melissa was greeted by the sight of the frankly massive hall which seemingly served as the laboratory for the project, though she guessed it wasn&#39;t the &#120368;&#120367;&#120365;&#120378; part of the lab because of the row of large windows that lined the left wall which gave sight into what looked like more proper labs. The projects hall one defining feature appeared to be the massive pool at the back with numerous spotlights shining into it and onto the various walkways that crossed over it, together with the row of large and bulky machines not that far from the pool, it was these machines Hadrian was leading them to and which was crowded with other labcoated people.<br />
<br />
&quot;The project has supplied the rubber corps 212 nautical operatives since its beginning 3 years ago and has given its operatives access to 16 unique forms since then, now after months of refining, testing and planning we are happy to say we&#39;ve supplied a 17th Model to the roster.&quot; The last thing he said in particular seemed to catch the attention of Mirabel who (despite her short stature) easily kept up with the far higher professor, before seeming to radiate Joy and Excitement with her expression. &quot;Currently the project keeps 6 Models for its active roster, with a 7th Model available for special circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The 6 Models on our active roster are as follows, &#39;Fish&#39;, &#39;Anglerfish&#39;, &#39;Anemone&#39;, &#39;Shark&#39;, &#39;Megalodon&#39; and &#39;Octopus&#39;. Our &#39;Fish&#39; Model is a generalist option for amphibious operatives who will be operating mostly on land but will benefit from on-demand amphibious capacity. Our &#39;Anglerfish&#39; model however is a cross with codename &#39;Lovedoll&#39; made to replace &#39;Mimic&#39; models in watery situations.&quot; Hadrian began to explain in a much more interested tone, also lending credence to the possibility his introduction was scripted in some way, possibly having learned it from repeating it over and over again. By this point they&#39;d reached the row of bulky machinery which on closer inspection looked like chambers of some sort, with the central chamber being much larger than the others, seemingly to fit something much larger. Mirabel was at this point just giddily watching from besides Hadrian, her long tentacles swaying from side to side excitedly as she stared with her oddly expressive yet creepily unblinking eyes (she has blinked, it just seems she doesn&#39;t do it instinctively).<br />
<br />
&quot;Our &#39;Shark&#39; model, in collaboration with codename Skinsuit, is a specialized capture-form for rapid abduction of select targets in an amphibious environment. While our &#39;Megalodon&#39; model is for all intents and purposes a far larger &#39;Shark&#39; meant to both lead a pack of &#39;Sharks&#39; and capture far more than one target. Our &#39;Anemone&#39; model is primarily a reconneassance model capable of sneaking up to sea-bound/based locations and supplying other operatives with live intel in an amphibious format. Finally the &#39;Octopus&#39; model is a special capture-form meant to stealthily abduct and/or sabotage inside a sea-faring vessel.&quot; The professor finished and was handed another clipboard by another scientist which he quickly looked over before writing something on it and handing it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;The 7th special model on the roster is, as you can see before you as shown by Mirabel here-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im the Kraken! The Princess of the seas! Rawr!&quot; Mirabel interrupted, striking a clawing pose that just didn&#39;t fit with the bunch of thrice-her-height tentacles splaying out as though she was a peacock. Despite the fact a Kraken probably didn&#39;t roar if it did exist, Melissa thought this childish display made Mirabel look cute with her energetic personality and demure inhumanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Kraken doesn&#39;t roar Mirabel.&quot; Hadrian however didn&#39;t seem to think her cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what does it do?&quot; Mirabel replied with a exasperated look at Hadrian, who for his part was silent for several moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Announces it&#39;s presence with the sudden appearance of its tentacles and the splashing of the sea.&quot; He finally stated in his bland tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pools too far away so im still gonna roar.&quot; Mirabel huffed in reply to his statement, then she seemed to brighten up with an idea. &quot;But what if we made a cannal from the pool to here? Or! Or! Or we could make a underwater tunnel that connects to the pool straight here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Mirabel, such would get in the way of most experiments and just be a hassle to work around for little gain, the only possible suggestion i can see being acceptable of your requirements would be to move the conversion chambers up against the pool. But this could result in the chambers being splashed with water which is unacceptable due to the temperementality of the Latex-polymer technologies included.&quot; Hadrian refused with a stern explanation and a tilt of his head in Mirabels direction. Watching this, Melissa wasn&#39;t sure what to think, but it seemed to her like Mirabel and professor Hadrian had an odd relationship, though she couldn&#39;t bring herself to think Hadrian could&#39;ve been Mirabels father (if she was even born a human in the first-place) because he was probably the least attractive guy here just based off personality alone, how someone could bear with his personality was beyond her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then im still gonna roar.&quot; Mirabel said with a pout at the outright refusal of her suggestion. Then there was a awkward silence as nobody said anything as the two&#39;s banter ended, Melissa shared a shrug with her fellow american as they looked at eachother and the rest of their special forces entourage.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, doc.&quot; The Navy SEALS woman beside her piped up, earning the attention of professor Hadrian as he motionlessly signaled for her to continue. &quot;We came here for new bodies did we not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, sorry I was just distracted.&quot; the professor coughed, an indignant &#39;Hey!&#39; from Mirabel let everyone know she did not appreciate being called a distraction. &quot;Well, I have the order of business right here so lets get down to it. Ahem...&quot;</p>
