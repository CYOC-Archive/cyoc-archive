<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The knights give you a rough jab as you&#39;re forced to stand, Yuriv beside you as the king leads. Your eyeline reaching the lions neck, the amulet constantly in view as you have an itching to remove it. To use your new might and tear apart the chain, to break the tooth into dust so that the curse might be removed. Yuriv&#39;s eyes glance at you, the stag following your gaze, seeing your intense desire to break the amulet. With a few heavy stomps, and one quick yell, Yuriv does what you were thinking to do.<br />
<br />
The stag&#39;s arms grabbing at the chain, his muscles tensing as you hear a loud snap. The tooth falling to the ground, shattering into a fine dust as a burst of wind emerges. You and the others are flung back, the knights and their new recruits landing across the camp as only Riefclaw and Yuriv remains in the centre. Riefclaw still stoically standing, while the burst has forced Yuriv to his knees. Riefclaw slowly turning around, you imagine his expression. Angry, furious. Full of vengeance towards Yuriv, a scowl across his face as he glares at Yuriv.<br />
<br />
Yet instead, he is smiling, chuckling even. The lion looking down at Yuriv, his claws clapping as Yuriv forces himself to look up to the bulky king.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done my heir, well done indeed. I was planning to wait till tonight, yet your bravery has accelerated my gift. I was right in making you my heir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv struggles to his feet, standing as the blast seems to settle. The knights around the camp returning to their feet, rushing forward, before the king gestures them to stop. Yuriv yelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll never be your heir! I broke your amulet, the curse should be fading any second now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The knights look confused, talking amongst each other as even you wonder if the amulet really was the curse. You don&#39;t feel different at all. You&#39;re still a lynx, covered in fur and with a higher than normal libido. Just one look at Yuriv makes you desire to be with him, nothings changed!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, my son. Did you really think that a king such as me would hide the curse in an amulet? No, of course not. The hiding place of the curse is far grander than a mere object.&quot;<br />
<br />
The amulet, now a fine powder, begins to blow with the wind. Though the movement is clearly unnatural, instead of blowing away it moves around Yuriv. The dust surrounding him as he tries to shoo it away. A set distance being remained as you see the stag overcome with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what the hell, what did you do Riefclaw!&quot;<br />
<br />
A grin forms for the lion. Yuriv seeming to struggle as he is once again brought to his knees. Riefclaw bending in front of him, matching his height as the lion chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are my son, I will happily tell you everything... so long as you call me father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv growls.<br />
<br />
&quot;No chance in hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
To which Riefclaw seems amused. He gestures for Jargus, the older wolf marching forward as he begins to remove his newly acquired armour. Jargus now fully naked as Riefclaw continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will willingly join me Yuriv, I can assure you that. In fact, I have a treat for you. Jargus, if you would.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jargus nods, kneeling next to Yuriv as he brings his head close. The wolf beginning to lap at Yuriv&#39;s body, Yuriv trying to weakly stop him, only failing as Jargus acts with more lust. Feeling Yuriv&#39;s lean torso, a hand running through it as a mouth kisses at the stags neck. A hand wondering to Yuriv&#39;s manhood, stroking it once as Yuriv begins to moan. Riefclaw looks to more knights, the men following suit. Makin, the bear and boar, as well as several ex-rebels stripping themselves down completely as they surround Yuriv. Worshiping him, each of them fighting to get close to the stag. To be the lucky one who gets to kiss his lips or suck his cock.<br />
<br />
Before long Yuriv is fully surrounded, Riefclaw watching with amusement as the knights continue to service Yuriv. The remnants of the tooth still surrounding Yuriv, the stag yelling several times as he&#39;s spent. His body taking control as he directs the knights. Forcing one on his cock, another under his pits, another two pressing against his chest. By the end of it, each knight is where he desires them, the knights continuing their duty no matter how many times they or Yuriv may cum. After what feels like an hour of pleasure, Riefclaw&#39;s deep and boisterous voice breaks through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, let us see my son&#39;s thoughts now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men separate, the group frantically panting as Yuriv is once again in full view of you. His back on the ground as he lays down, the fine dust still spinning around him as Riefclaw asks again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better now, my son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv musters up his strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, never!&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw walks around Yuriv, examine him after that statement. The lion seeming amused, his eyes gleaming with victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no as much as you want, son. But I can tell I have won. You liked that far more than you will admit. You enjoyed having the knights at your command, their bodies devoted to you and only you. Your force dominating them, overpowering them. It is as it should be, no? Us rulers served by our subjects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv goes to speak, but Riefclaw cuts him off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jargus, once more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jargus once again steps forward, remaining next to Riefclaw as the king whispers something to the wolf. Jargus kneeling next to Yuriv, a hand gently stroking the stags chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father, Duke Neren… I did not tell you the full truth of what happened to him. Forgive this wolf for being a fool my liege.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv seems to struggle, his hand weakly grabbing Jargus&#39; as he tries to stop him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Jargus I&#39;m not a prince, I&#39;m-&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet Jargus continues, ignoring Yuriv&#39;s pleas. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are, my liege. Riefclaw has made you his son, and you must take your new place under him. It is what your father would want, he waits for you to this day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv&#39;s eyes go wide, his struggles dying as he listens intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duke Neren willingly gave into Riefclaw, he begged for the king to convert him while he was still a man, and so the king did. Neren becoming a mighty stag, devoted to the king in all aspects. The first of the kings ever-growing harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jargus looks to the king, Riefclaw nodding as he steps away. Riefclaw now standing over Yuriv, a twisted smile across his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have heard it, my son. Your former father lives, he wishes to see you again, to see you as a ruler. Yet he is not alone in his wishes, I wish to see you as a ruler, as do all my new knights.&quot;<br />
<br />
A cheer surrounds the two, the knights chanting Yuriv&#39;s name as they wait for his response. Yuriv struggling for a moment, his eyes connecting with Riefclaw as you see something you dread. Yuriv&#39;s soft and stoic expression twisting into a wicked smile, the same smile Riefclaw had earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dad. I want to know the truth, about everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
With his confession becomes a wave of movement. The remnants of the fang moving closer and closer to Yuriv, until it presses against his fur. The stag remaining perfectly still as Riefclaw begins to walk around him, watching him very closely for something. Something that you do not think you want to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, my son. Good. You see, I developed the curse years ago. Spending hundreds of years locked away in my tower, my life barely kept due to the ancient magics I had uncovered. Yet eventually I perfected this curse, this gift that I sought! I became a mighty lion, my age no longer progressing as I know I had to spread my might. My gift tested on a nearby village, the men succumbing within minutes as the women and children were forced to flee. My gift overtaking them, converting them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw seems full of pride, his gloating stopped only for a moment as he stares at a part of Yuriv&#39;s chest. You try to run closer, to see what is happening to the man you love. But you feel a rough hand grab you, the wolf who started it all holding you by your arm as he shakes his head. Your vision only barely being able to make out what is occurring, Yuriv&#39;s brown fur turning a bright gold as his chest seems to inflate. Bulk being added to Yuriv as his chest starts to redefine, looking oddly familiar... No! Yuriv&#39;s chest is beginning to resemble Riefclaws!<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, my son, my gift is not found in a trinket. I did not hide it in an object, I implanted it in all of us. I am the origin of the curse, the origin of the gift! With each new convert, the gift is spread. Their bodies containing the curse just as mine does. You see, my son... to end this curse would require killing every last beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv begins to take deep breaths. The bulk and fur spreading to his arms and legs as he looks into his new fathers eyes. His cock fully erect and leaking, Riefclaw seeing his sons needs kneeling next to him and stroking. The gold having fully overtaken his hands in seconds, though you see the changes are not full. Yuriv&#39;s hands have remained the same, golden in fur and with bulk, but not with the claws of a lion. His fur may be changing colour, but he is not becoming a lion.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-father, why isn&#39;t everyone a loyal subject then? If we are the curse then-&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw hush&#39;s Yuriv, the stag&#39;s head becoming the same gold as his chest as the Lion continues to stroke. His hand now soaked in Yuriv&#39;s pre, the amount far exceeding what you knew the man could produce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my son, the curse did not fully take hold. They needed a second serving for the curse to finish, for them to embrace what they have become and join us in this life. A second serving or... a realisation, a want to fully give into the beast, as you have now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv begins to groan as the gold fully coats him, his fur and new bulk matching the kings. With their conversation finished, Riefclaw&#39;s attention is fixed to Yuriv&#39;s dick. The lion&#39;s strokes seeming masterful, Yuriv beginning to squirm, held down by one firm hand resting on his chest. Before long there is a spray of seed, Yuriv&#39;s limit reached, and something else unleashed. <br />
<br />
At first you think it&#39;s nothing, but then you are suddenly released. The wolf knight panting heavily, rapidly doing his best to reach his cock as he collapses to his knees and strokes. His nose pointed into the air as he takes deep sniffs. The other knights do the same, Riefclaw lifting up Yuriv&#39;s arm as he takes a sniff of his pits.<br />
<br />
&quot;The scent of a king has found itself within you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it hits you, a force so great that you cannot stand. Your knees resting on the floor as your dick springs to erection, your hand weakly grasping at your feline member as you rub your pre-soaked member. Your improved nose taking in all of the scent, every individual smell that makes up Yuriv now present and full of majesty. A new royalty to the smell that made up your partner, filled with dominance and awe. A smell that makes you kneel and wish to serve, to service a stench that could only belong to a king.<br />
<br />
The knights around the camp do not hold for long, their fluids weakly spilling as they take in the princes might. You cannot resist either, your dick spilling as you collapse. Your body overcome from the recent sexual release and from the new smell that takes over your senses. Your eyes close as you hear Riefclaw demand the knights to march...<br />
<br />
When you next wake, you seem to be in a room. Your body fully naked and placed on an elegant bed. Fine fabrics around the room, rich furnishing greeting you as well. Elegant paintings, ebony desks and closets. You go to stand, examining the surroundings closer as you take in their design. Your examination halted as the door slowly begins to open...</p>
