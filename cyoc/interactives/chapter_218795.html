<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some awkward encouragement from Sam, Cole spills the beans on the salve and what had happened to him and Sam. He also told what he knew of Erika’s situation and what was happing to her the last time he spoke to Erika. Melissa was in shock, as their mother stared blankly at him for a few moments before speaking. Then, Cole’s mother places her phone into her pocket before walking up to her son. <br />
<br />
“Are you an idiot!” She says as she smacks him on the back of his head. “You see that Melissa’s friend is changed by some strange substance and you go spray it on your crotch!!!” Sam backs up some, but without releasing Cole’s hand. Cole’s mom looks over at Sam, her face turning from anger to softer concern. “Are you really Sam? The one of my son’s friends?” <br />
<br />
“Yes ma’am.” Sam replied, her grip growing tighter on Cole’s hand. <br />
<br />
Cole’s mom brings her hand up to her head and starts to massage her eyes. “God. What are we going to do? Have you told your mom yet?” <br />
“No, Ma’am.” Sam replies meekly. <br />
<br />
“I take it that you and Cole thought I was going to help with that?” Cole’s mom asks. Sam could only nod her head. “Okay.” Cole’s mom replies with a deep breath. She looks over to her daughter Melissa before saying. “Well, I think they already know about you, dear. So, you might as well have your brother take care of the babies when they are done being breastfeed. We need to find Sam some better fitting clothes before he… she comes out to her mom.” <br />
<br />
Melissa hesitates before relenting and uncovering herself. Under the blanket, one of the babies, the boy that was now mostly human but his ears and tail, had already fallen asleep. The girl, which looked more like a werewolf baby, was still suckling some on Melissa’s right breast. Melissa looks down at them before asking. “What do I do now?” <br />
<br />
Cole’s and Melissa’s mom walks over to the kitchen to place a hand towel over her shoulder before she returns to her daughter and picks up the boy. She places the sleeping boy over her shoulder on top of the hand towel before lightly patting his back. “You need to burp them, or they will get indigestion. It’s fine if they are asleep, as long as they get burped.” As she pats, the boy gives a few small burps without waking up. When satisfied, she lays the baby down on the open area of the couch, and waves for Cole to come over. <br />
<br />
“Sit with him. Just make sure he doesn’t roll off and if he wakes up, let us know. Of course, half the neighborhood will a newborn baby.” Cole’s and Melissa’s mom states before adding, “Melissa, join us when your daughter is done.” <br />
<br />
Cole’s and Melissa’s mom then takes Sam upstairs into Melissa’s room to find her some fresh clothes. When inside, she asks, “I take it that Cole brought the skirt from in here.” <br />
<br />
“Yes ma’am. He couldn’t find me socks or shoes.” Sam replies. <br />
<br />
“Panties?” Cole’s mother then asks. <br />
<br />
Sam hesitates, not having any on as the pairs that they did have before were now soaked with her and Cole’s juices on the other side of his bed. “No, ma’am. I have nothing right now.” <br />
<br />
“Well, get undressed and I will find you something more proper. I may have to find one of my old bras and tops, but Melissa’s other clothes should fit better. For your lower half. Also, if you have any question on your body, ask them now.” Cole’s mother then stops and thanks before adding. “Know what, you should shower too. We will find you some clothes to fit and then let you shower before calling your mother over.” <br />
<br />
Cole’s and Melissa’s mother then pulls a towel out of her daughter’s closet and sets it on the bed as Sam asks, “What is wrong with the skirt that I have on?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I know I don’t have a blouse that would match that. Plus, if you were wearing jeans, it may be easier to show your mother that your body has changed when you are in a skirt or a dress without having to show off as much skin. Once everything calms down, maybe we can take you shopping too. I know your mother has been having trouble since your father’s death, so I am more then happy to help. Besides, I saw the way you held Cole and looked at him. I looked at my husband like that when we were younger.” Coles mother then walks over to Sam and placed a hand on her shoulder. She was hiding her own uncertainties, trying to be brave for the teens. <br />
<br />
Sam nods her head before removing her old boy’s shirt and the skirt that Cole had taken from Melissa’s room. As she stood there naked, Cole’s and Melissa’s mother placing potential pants and panties up to her, Melissa herself came in. After the shock of seeing Sam in the buff, a person that she knew as a boy only a short time before, she walks over to help. <br />
<br />
“I told Sam that she should take a shower before getting dressed, you should too. Maybe you could show how girls clean themselves and what to look out for.” Melissa’s mother suggests. “I mean, at her age, she would be having periods by now.” <br />
<br />
Sam’s eyes went wide, as she never thought of that before. Sam had always wanted breasts, and even her new slit. But she never thought about what all came with it. <br />
<br />
Melissa sees Sam’s realization and adds to the dilemma. “Yeah, you are going to have that now, and random cramps, even before my breasts exploded to their new sides, they would randomly be sore. Sometimes even leak, though not to the extent that they do now after me giving birth.”<br />
<br />
Sam brings her hands up to her breasts, lightly touching over her enlarged, dark nipples. Comparing them to Melissa’s milk filled breasts, Sam had larger nipples and areola, but smaller over all breasts. Melissa’s also seem to poke out, as Sam’s were flatter and less erect. Going further down, Sam looks over the light red hairs that now sparsely covered her crotch. She moves her hand down to it, running her longer fingernails through it. “Should I shave?” <br />
<br />
“That is up to you.” Melissa replies, “I do, but it takes a bit to keep up. Now, your legs, you will when they start to grow out. I will show you in the shower.” <br />
<br />
Melissa’s mother then chimes in. “Well, I have a few pairs of pants and panties for her. Take her to the show.” <br />
Melissa nods her head before taking Sam’s wrist and pulling her along. Both girls grab a towel before walking, mostly naked down the hallway to the bathroom. In the bathroom, Melissa drops the rest of her clothes before turning on the water. Sam sees Melissa full body now, gapping at its new shape.</p>
