<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hmm... perhaps children would be nice, to start our race off.” Ty suggested as Nichole raised an eyebrow.<br />
“Could you not just wish for us to be pregnant, or perhaps change humans into Harpies?” She suggested back as Ty nodded.<br />
“True, but there is no fun in that. Humans are two things to us now, food.” She started, before flashing her fangs, “and children.” She finished.<br />
“Children?” Nichole questioned as Ty shook her head before walking over to the edge of their nest and jumping off, taking to the air from free fall, Nichole following after her.<br />
The pair soared above the forest, their eyes scanning the area as they listened for any sounds, Ty frowned, their eyes were not good enough and their ears were too small. Something to fix when she wasn’t in flight she supposed.<br />
Dipping down she dropped into a tree, gracefully landing on a low hanging branch and perching there by gripping it with her talons, Nichole joining her seconds later as Ty made her wish.<br />
“I wish our eyes were much better and our ears were more sensitive and larger.” Ty muttered as Nichole nodded, she’d noticed that problem.<br />
“Oh wow...” Nichole gasped as her eyes adjusted, the forest being far clearer and small creatures were seen scurrying about, and she could hear so many minor sounds with her larger twitching ears that poked out from beneath her feathery hair. Looking at Ty she saw they seemed similar to elven ears, but their eyes had turned yellow as Ty scanned the forest.<br />
“I see red, and I can hear crackling, do you?” Ty asked, focusing her senses she heard the crackling but didn’t see the red.<br />
“I hear it sister.” She said, Ty grinning in response before silently taking to the air, diving up past the trees with a light rustle before flying towards the sound’s source with Nichole.<br />
The two landed atop a tree and looked down, seeing a male and female pair of humans packing up camp with an already going out fire.<br />
“I’ll grab the male, you take the female.” Ty said, Nichole nodding as the two got ready.<br />
As soon as the humans backs were turned, the pair struck, taking to the air as Ty swooped down first, grabbing the male by the shoulders with her talons and flying back up as he screamed in pain, blood running down her arms from her talons as Nichole grabbed the female, both harpies lifting off as their captured prey screamed in fear. They were swearing and saying other things, but neither cared as they kept rising over the forest, their passengers well aware if they did anything stupid they would be in for a lethal fall. Didn’t stop them from shouting during high speed flight.<br />
It took the harpies mere minutes to reach their nest in the mountains, Ty dropping the male in, followed by Nichole dropping the female before both harpies beat their wings in the air to maintain flight right above the humans, who’s bleeding shoulders made it clear their arms were out of commission for the moment.<br />
“Be thankful humans, we aren’t hungry right now...” Ty declared with a purr as Nichole spoke. “We are however... in need of children.” She spoke, going along with Ty’s plan as the two humans started shouting something at them, neither harpy caring what they were saying.<br />
“I’ll take the male, you the female.” Ty said as Nichole nodded and Ty spoke up. “Be still, and accept your fate.” She declared before landing right in front of the male, barring fangs. Her breasts were the center of attention though, enough that the male fell silent at the sight of the naked orbs as Ty squished them against his face. And whispered something.<br />
“I wish that, feet first, you shall be sucked into my vagina and transform into my egg, making me pregnant.” Ty whispered low enough the human could not hear as he sat down on his ass, and Ty started ripping his clothing off.<br />
The female was about to start shouting, only for Nichole to do the same and rip her clothing off, exposing her to the chilling air before covering her with her wings.<br />
“Be still my soon to be daughter, and enjoy the show.” She purred in the woman’s ear, causing her to shut up as Ty was leading the male’s feet to her vagina.<br />
He was still face first with her breasts, so he didn’t realize as his naked feet made contact with Ty’s wet hole, the harpy moaning as her vagina started to stretch to accommodate his feet, and was slowly sucking him in. Once she was certain he was stuck, by the time his feet were completely inside her, she pulled her breasts away from his face.<br />
The male was mesmerized, up until the point he looked down and started screaming at the sight of his legs stuck together and slowly being pulled into the crazy creature’s vagina, he tried to crawl away, but it was no use as she wrapped her wings around him on the ground.<br />
“Relax my daughter... you’ll be much better soon.” She cooed in his ear, but that only served to try and make him struggle more, as futile as it was as his knees were absorbed into her vagina. Her stomach was bulging with the infant pregnancy and she could feel it, his feet and legs were starting to change inside her.<br />
“What is...” the female started as Nichole nuzzled her cheek against the woman’s. “He will be reborn, just as you will, as our daughters.” Nichole said quietly, the woman gulping, but knowing she wasn’t going to be able to escape.<br />
The male tired quickly, his rampant energy being spent as his hips were absorbed into Ty’s vagina. H’s stopped flailing, having seemingly accepted his fate, as he could feel his legs were long gone now, part of the shell that was to become his egg. The rest of his absorption wasn’t very climatic, save for Ty feeling the need to take off into the air and make the male scream one more time before his head vanished into her vagina, and it shrunk back to its normal size, and it was clear Ty was now heavily pregnant with a large egg.<br />
“Oh my god...” the woman muttered as Nichole nuzzled her again.<br />
“I wish that the female would enter Nichole’s vagina and become her egg, making her pregnant.” Ty whispered as a wish, causing Nichole to smirk from hearing it with her ears as the woman found herself kneeling before Nichole’s vagina.<br />
“You want to be by baby, do you not?” Nichole teased, the woman leaning forward slowly... before Nichole shoved her vagina into the woman’s face, causing her to panic as it envolped her head and slowly started to ‘eat’ her to become Nichole’s egg.<br />
Inside the woman was panting as she felt more and more of her body being pulled inside the sticky cavern of the Harpy’s womb. She couldn’t see, but she could feel as her hair was starting to change, her ears starting to extend as her body was shrinking the further in She was absorbed. Before long she found her entire body, still changing, curled up inside Nichole’s womb as a shell formed around her, encasing her within the egg as Nichole sighed with relief.<br />
The two pregnant harpies nuzzled each other, and set a wing on the other’s belly. Their eggs would be laid shortly, and soon they’d bring new life into the world... the world that was going to be theirs.</p>
