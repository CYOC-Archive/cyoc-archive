<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Anyway....&quot;Sam says &quot;Lets continue the tour<br />
<br />
Glad that the awkward silence has passed Sam continues taking you around the place. During the tour you come Sam explains to you that the facility you are in is actually a hidden underground bunker near the port that used to be used by the island when it first started, it is no longer used due to getting extra funding. They built a facility on top of the actual source of Substance A-105, Pleasure Island itself, and abandoned this one. Since that was more than a decade or two ago the bas has been forgotten by nearly everyone, only Sam and at least 5 others know about it, that Sam knows about anyway.<br />
<br />
During the tour you are shown that the facility is very large and consists of 12 levels, all connected by elevators. The levels are as follows:<br />
<br />
1st level - Entrance lobby and information desk<br />
2nd level - Experimentation/testing rooms and main security<br />
3rd level - Dorms, Private rooms, dining hall and laboratories<br />
4th level - Recreational floor<br />
5th level - Relaxation and rehabilitation floor<br />
6th level - Weapon and Battle suit development/testing<br />
7th level - Advanced weapon and battle suit development/testing<br />
8th level - Vehicle development/testing<br />
9th level - Training and Advanced training rooms<br />
10th level - Inaccessible<br />
11th level - Troop deployment and briefing room<br />
12th level - Destroyed/inaccessible<br />
<br />
You are amazed by the amount of rooms on each floor, the recreational facilities had a giant gym, basketball hall (multipurpose), the relaxation floor had a big swimming pool (and you saw a few people in there swimming, some of which where amphibious, you swear you even saw a mermaid), it also has a room called the rehabilitation room Which, you are told, is now used to help some of the people her to control their urges to 'fill their sexual desire', as Sam put it. You try to ask Sam about the levels after 5 but she says she will explain them afterwards. Also during the tour you come across a variety of people in different progression stages. Most you came across were Stage 2's Types 2-3, but you did run into a couple Stage 1's type 2's. You also came across others that did not get transformed into animals, some were turned into the opposite gender (which do not have stages or types and cannot stop the change, all they can stop is any mind alterations that the person verbally announces), some were turned into people from comics, cartoon, films or anime albeit they would look like what the character would in real life, it is also possible to transform into mythological creatures and have special abilities, with reminds you that Sune had two tails and normal foxes have one. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what is Sune?&quot; you ask Sam during the tour<br />
<br />
&quot;Sune is a Kitsune&quot; She explains to you &quot;Hence 'Sune' as her codename. And since she is a kitsune she has magical abilites akin to what is known in mythology, and some not. She can shapeshift into any person she desires and has powers of the elements, such as fire and water. In the mythology, however, it is said that Kitsune only grow additional tails when they reach a life of 100yrs so she had to age to gain the second tail...because she is 18 the powder added a 100 to her age to make her 180yrs old, luckily she aged after her transforming enough for her to suddenly age 100 years as a human, otherwise she would have died. This confused the aging process however as she now ages in ten's rather than 1 like we normally do&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So on her next birthday she will become 190 years old?!&quot; You exclaim surprised beyond belief at how old she had become<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Sam answers stopping at the elevator &quot;Kit is the same as well. He is also a 'Kit'sune he hides his second tail with his shapeshifting to make it  look like he has one tail. He will also age in tens. Because he is young he can not control his abilities as well as his sister and most of the time he has tried to use his magic it either fails completely or it is a very weakened version&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; you say aloud &quot;I didn't think that was possible&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh&quot; Sam says with indignation &quot;With the powder anything is possible&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed like she was quoting the sentence from someone she had heard it from but you don't press the issue. You are also told that it is physically and biologically impossible for someone to be turned into an inanimate object (which was explained in great depth by Sam but most of it blew over our head). reaching the end of the tour Sam brings you to the 3rd floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is the end of the tour&quot; Sam says stopping just outside the dorm area &quot;Watch do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is huge!&quot; You exclaim filled with amazement &quot;It is very impressive&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you like it!&quot; Sam says smiling &quot;I believe you asked about the lower levels earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did&quot; You reply with rapt attention, you have been waiting for a reply ever since you asked and you were now positively begging to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; Sam begins pushing her glasses up &quot;Pleasure island isn't ALL about pleasure, they have to get funds from other avenues as well. So they developed a way to introduce the powder in combat situations. First as a chemical weapon, which of course was a instant success and gave more funding to the weapons research. Second they began using it to create super soldiers, but because the powder is a transmortative and not a enhancement of the person, they had to use volunteers to be changed to an animal or another person, be given the vaccine to stop it at the desired location, and then use specialised weapons and vehicles. These weapons and vehicles could only be used by them, effectively anyway, and thus they made the worlds first weapons used by transformees. These where more deadly, as it used the residue of the substance left in their blood stream, than the standard weapons that the military used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;However&quot; Sam continues &quot;They could not stand up, directly anyway, against the army's bigger hitters, tanks and the like. So they then started to make battle suits for their operatives to use during combat. These suits were made out of substance A-105 and thus could change shape of their user and could also change their user to fit in situations that they couldn't before, such as making a sea transformee be able to walk on land. It was found that people who had reached stage 2 were better suited to the battle suits, magical creature transformees were the most strongest in their use. When deployed these soldiers could stand up to tanks, fighter jets and even an army of ten thousand soldiers. Naturally their funders wanted more and gave them more money to develop the most powerful weapons and suits that they could. This brought about the Advanced weapons and battle suit devision. They developed even more powerful weapons and battle suits that could wipe out entire cities. The suits, and user, could even survive a nuclear blast. However the Pleasure island company grew greedy and started to make its own army in secret. They created even stronger suits that could best even the strongest suits that they had sold to armies. In fact they were too powerful, at one test the suit somehow overloaded and made a blast so huge it was equivalent to the power of the Tsar bomb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God...&quot; you say terrified at the power that the island could, and still does, command &quot;Where di that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;Sam says with a serious look &quot;you know the 12 level? There used to be more than that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More?&quot; you ask gulping &quot;How many more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;500&quot; Sam says after a while<br />
<br />
&quot;Fi....five Hun..dred...?&quot; You manage to say. You are stunned into silence. 'This place used to have 500 floors?!'</p>
