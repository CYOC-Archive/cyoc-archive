<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was enjoying deepthroating his new toy so he went back to it, he shoved all the beads into his mouth to the base bead then pressed the gem, once it was red he started pulling, first until all of the original beads were out of his mouth, then pushing them back in and continuing like that, popping a single new bead out of his lips before pushing them all back in, each one getting larger each time.<br />
<br />
With his eyes closed and lost in the new feelings coming from his throat, Kyle didn&#39;t even realise how large the beads had gotten! What ever magic was imbued into them was strong, so strong that with each pull out of his mouth impossibly large beads would emerge, only to glide easily back down his throat, their outline painfully obvious as his neck, chest and stomach stretched massively with their repeat insertions. <br />
<br />
Kyles hands moved quickly as he pulled then shoved all the huge beads in and out of his gaping throat, saliva practically running down his chin, if it wasn&#39;t so full and stretched there would have been loud moans of pleasure coming from deep in Kyles throat as he rapidly fucked his face.<br />
<br />
So enraptured by his toy was Kyle that he hadn&#39;t heard his Dads call for dinner, nor the repeat calls from his brothers, or the semi loud thudding of one of his brothers walking up the stairs to check on him.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Kyle, in his haste and excitement to try his new toy he had forgotten to actually make sure his bedroom door was locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ky?&quot; Called one of his brothers from behind the closed door, &quot;You ok in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened slowly as Kyle realised only too late, he hastily tried to pull his toy from his throat, at first forgetting the directions as more larger beads pulled out!<br />
<br />
Frantically he shoved all the beads back down his throat to the base and pressed the gem, his stomach bulging massively!<br />
<br />
Even as slowly as his brother was opening the door, Kyle didn&#39;t have the time he needed! His stomach was growing smaller with each moment that passed but it was too slow, Kyle remembered the instructions, and their warning, but the closer to being discovered he was the more he panicked, his desperation was getting the better of him!<br />
<br />
With his stomach still bulging slightly Kyle quickly pulled the beads from his throat, they slid out easily until the last one which caught for a moment at his throat, his neck swollen with its presence, until with a pop that Kyle felt and a slurp the huge bead dislodged from his throat and left his mouth, his lips closing sloppily behind it.<br />
<br />
Kyle quickly pulled his bed cover up over his toy and his waist as he brother finally opened the door fully and could see him laid on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Ky, Dad called you a few times, dinner is almost ready... Um, did you spill a drink on your self?&quot; Kyles brother Jake asked as he looked questioningly at the wet state of Kyles bare chest and damp bed covers.<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed at almost being caught as he looked at himself and his bed, it was almost soaked. &quot;Ah... Yesh... I&#39;ll be down in a minute!&quot; He quickly got out, his mouth feeling weird, looser some how.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaay then,&quot; Jake said as he rolled his eyes and left the room, not bothering to close the door.<br />
<br />
Kyle breathed out a breath he didn&#39;t realise he&#39;d been holding in, slightly relieved that his brother hadn&#39;t seen him with his toy down his throat!<br />
<br />
As he surveyed his soaked sheets he noticed the toy, it hadn&#39;t shrunk back to its original size, it was still much longer and the last bead was easily two of his fists put together. &quot;Thats weird...&quot; Kyle said as he felt his face, it felt normal, maybe a little softer, looser maybe. <br />
<br />
Slowly Kyle felt around his mouth, softly moaning as he brushed his fingers along his lips, his mouth instantly starting to drool again as he pressed a finger in, sucking it in and licking it like he was sucking on a lolly but not feeling anywhere near satisfied.<br />
<br />
He quickly added another finger, followed by a third, in a short time he had his entire hand in his mouth, his tongue somehow sliding around it, coating it, preparing it to go deeper.<br />
<br />
Shocked but unable to stop himself, Kyle watched as his arm slid down his throat until his elbow was at his lips, physically unable to go any deeper. Despite the shock Kyle moaned softly around his arm.<br />
<br />
Realising that he had to clean up and head down to dinner Kyle pulled his arm from his throat, his shock making way to pleasure as he slowly removed his hand from his mouth. <br />
<br />
&#39;The warning!&#39; Kyle realised, &#39;I interrupted the process! Does that mean this change is permanent? It&#39;s weird but it felt really good maybe I can live with it, but it could be a problem, couldn&#39;t it?&#39; <br />
<br />
Kyle thought maybe the toy needed to finish its process before it would return to its normal size and maybe that would return his throat to its former state.<br />
<br />
Picking the large beads up and making sure the gem was still blue he rapidly shoved them all back down his throat with surprising ease, once they were in to the base he again pressed the gem, switching it to red.<br />
<br />
&#39;They feel so good&#39; Kyle thought to himself as he started pulling them out and shoving them back in like he was before his brother came in, each time making them larger and larger and again making his stomach swell when they were all inserted again.<br />
<br />
Kyle then...</p>
