<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liberty and Monique spent the next 40 minutes squeezing and pumping Jewell’s breasts, doing their best to empty all the milk. Jewell had never been more uncomfortable and aroused at the same time. Her sensitive breasts causing immense pleasure all at once as she was milked like a cow. All the milk was poured into two buckets, one bucket for each breast. <br />
Monique wasn’t happy about it, but enjoyed watching her young icon rival suffer through her pleasure. Her innocence leaving her as she endured such an experience. <br />
<br />
By the time Jewell’s breasts had decreased around two thirds of their size, no milk was coming out, only tiny drops were appearing, and they weren’t very consistent. Lucky for Jewell, her breasts no longer felt like they weighed the equivalent of a watermelon, each. Unluckily, her breasts were almost triple her original B cup size, sitting at what Monique guessed as a full double D. <br />
Jewell was at the point where she didn’t completely trust everything Monique had to say... but she was a little worried that this might not be a lie.<br />
<br />
Liberty tried her best to find something in the house for Jewell to wear, being strictly instructed to find something that wasn’t too revealing. Sadly, this house belonged to Monique, so finding something that wasn’t skimpy was virtually impossible.<br />
Eventually, she found something. It was both a bra and a similar sweater to what Jewell had originally wore. The bra belonged to Monique, who had ordered a bygone assistant to purchase for her. The assistant purchased it in the wrong size, however, and Monique had fired her immediately after. The sweater belonged to that assistant, who hadn’t been allowed to collect her belongings before being swiftly kicked out of the house and sent on her way.<br />
Liberty handed the sweater and bra to Jewell. She took both to the bathroom to try on, despite the fact that both women had now seen her bare breasts, not to mention they had literally milked them.<br />
<br />
Jewell returned wearing both the bra and the sweater. The bra seemed to fit, but was maybe a size or so smaller than hoped. However it was the best they were going to get. The sweater, on the other hand, was clearly made for a much smaller woman. The buttons that held it together were a little strained, and a tiny part of her midriff was visible, revealing her pert, yet a little chubby stomach. The final button sat right in the centre of Jewell’s chest, making her cleavage distinctly on display. Which wasn’t something she was particularly happy with, however, she wasn’t about to complain considering it was only an hour ago that her breasts would have torn right through this sweater, so she simply said,<br />
<br />
“Let’s pack this up, I want to speak to my manager and see what the budget of getting these reduced is,”<br />
“Sounds like a fantastic idea to me. I need to book another appointment and get this bleached,” Monique added, making it sound like her problem was much more important,<br />
“Um, girls?” Liberty interrupted, as Monique had started to walk out of the room, “I think there’s a much better solution to the problems, but I’m not sure if y’all are gonna like it,” she said, holding up the instructions to the game. <br />
<br />
The almost yellow paper looked old and had been crumpled over and over, even one corner of it looked like I had been burnt. Liberty handed the paper to Monique, who snatched it quickly out of Liberty’s hand. She skimmed over the whole page before noticing what Liberty was talking about,<br />
<br />
“‘Once a player wins the game, the changes will be undone, making all players return to normal’, so if someone wins the game, we all go back to normal?” Monique asked,<br />
“That’s what it says... I think,” Liberty said, doubting herself towards the end, “and I’m pretty sure there’s something else,”<br />
“‘The winning player will be granted one wish of their choice’,” Monique stood there, thinking for a moment, “so if someone wins, I get to make a wish? Any wish?” Monique asked,<br />
“N-no, it says the winning player...” Jewell added, trying to cross her arms, forgetting her now increased bust,<br />
“Same difference,” Monique said, scrunching the paper with one hand and pushing it into Liberty’s chest. She walked to her seat, grabbing the two dice as she does this, and quickly throws them across the table. Once again, her aim managing to be consistent, both dice land next to each other.<br />
One showing a 3, and the other showing a 4.<br />
<br />
“Saves a trip to the salon,” Monique said, nonchalantly, picking up her card and reading it aloud,<br />
“Keep getting distracted and you’ll be playing into the night,<br />
Each player will swap their attitude with whoever’s on their right.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-” Monique sat there, clueless, “what does that mean?” She asked Liberty, who looked at her quickly before looking down again, awkwardly.<br />
“Are you stupid?” Jewell asked, rudely, “we’ve all switched attitudes. You have Liberty’s attitude, she has mine, and I have... ugh! I have yours,” Jewell said, frustratedly,<br />
“O-okay, Jewell, let’s calm-” Liberty tried to say, but quickly silenced herself as Jewell gave her a mean stare,<br />
“Do me a favour and just roll so I can act like me again,” Jewell said, slapping Liberty hard in the arm.<br />
“Woah...” Monique said subconsciously, staring at Jewell’s jiggling breasts,<br />
“Are you seriously looking at my tits right now? After you literally... ugh I CANNOT even deal with this right now!” Jewell said, crossing her legs and squeezing her arms as tightly together as she could manage.<br />
Liberty grabbed the two dice and threw them a little too carefully. They barely even rolled, which didn’t work out well as one of them fell backwards and into the floor,<br />
“Oh my god,” Jewell said out loud, covering her face in self absorbed shame,<br />
<br />
Liberty leaned down and saw her die, it was a 1. She picked it up and looked at the other die, it was a 5.<br />
She carefully pushed the dice to Jewell, who swiped them from the table and began rattling them obnoxiously.<br />
Liberty grabbed her card and read it out for everything to hear,<br />
“Its a shame teens never seem to smile,<br />
Why don’t you copy the other one’s style?”<br />
<br />
Liberty placed the card on the table, looking at her nails as suddenly they began to colour themselves blue. She looked at her blue top as it quickly turned softer. Buttons appeared on the front as the v-neck stretched ever further to reveal her relatively small chest, especially when compared to the other two women. Her pink skirt quickly became fairly tight black shorts. Her flip flops soon changed and became much thicker, blacker boots, stretching almost half the way up her calf. Her makeup began to change too, eyeliner being the most prominent difference, becoming darker and creating a better shape too. Her eyeshadow also changed too, making her eyes look a little deeper. She looked edgier.<br />
Finally, finishing off the look, her hair began to shorten. It reducing more and more as suddenly it began turning the same lapis blue that Jewell famously rocked. Soon, all her hair was blue. <br />
<br />
“Great,” Jewell said, “next round let’s hope you grow udders too, then we’ll be identical!” Jewell said, finding it difficult to be any more sarcastic.<br />
She threw the two dice once again, both landing at the other end of the table, right in front of Monique, who was a little startled by it.<br />
Jewell leaned over the table, dangling her breasts from Monique stare right at, she had rolled two 4’s.<br />
<br />
“Does it say anything in the rules about rolling double?” She asked, reaching over to grab her card, “either of you!?” She snapped at them. Once again, Monique was startled, but had no idea. Liberty was pretty sure she knew, but couldn’t bring herself to say anything until after Jewell started reading out her card, “fine, I guess nothing special happens,”<br />
“Growing two milk jugs isn’t such a bad thing,<br />
Next to the mixture, we’ll add some extra padding!”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got to fu-” Jewell quickly stops what she’s saying, her attitude switched back. She was back to the awkward, young, growing woman... and she was growing more than she expected.<br />
<br />
She watched as her pudgy thighs, squished against her seat, began to spread a little more to on the chair. She placed her hand on her face, feeling her cheeks slowly swell a little more, her face becoming squishier, but retaining their softness. She couldn’t see it over her melons, but she placed her hand on her belly. Just as she did, she felt a button quickly pop off. She was prepared for another cascade of buttons to fly off, like before. But instead, she felt her body stop growing. She hadn’t gained a considerable amount of weight, but it was enough for Monique to start giggling.<br />
<br />
“Hun...” Liberty said, placing her hand on Jewell’s chubby thigh, “I don’t want to alarm you, but you asked about what happens when you roll a double...” Liberty said, sliding Jewell the paper, placing her finger on the ‘doubles’ section.<br />
<br />
“If a player rolls a double, any players (during the next round) who roll the same number, will cause the change to be doubled.”<br />
<br />
Jewell sat back in her chair, causing it to creak slightly. She sat there, staring at nothing, contemplating where she was right now. One minute she’s on her way to one of her idols’ home to record a charity event. The next, she’s got the attitude of a bitch, the tits of a cow, and the weight of a pig. And they were only in round 2.<br />
<br />
“So, I guess I’ll roll next, right?” Monique said, enjoying watching Jewell’s suffering, once again. She was praying that she’d roll a four.<br />
“No!” Jewell shouted across the table, “I need...” she couldn’t speak, her mind was racing and her anger was rising. Her therapist had told her that the best thing she could was just take 5 minutes to the side in order to calm herself down whenever she’s stressed, overworked, or just generally needs a moment, <br />
<br />
“I need 15 minutes,” Jewell spoke, standing herself up, feeling the tiniest change in how much her body jiggled as she did,<br />
“But Jewell, we need-” Monique started, talking to her in a condescending tone, the same she’d use when talking to a child,<br />
“No!” Jewell shouted once again. She stormed her way out of the room and found a bathroom in the hallway leading into the room. She opened it, stepped in, and slammed the door shut. She locked it afterwards, dramatically flicking the lock, making quite a loud click.<br />
<br />
Monique was sitting in her seat, smirking at the door. Liberty was a little more worried, but she trusted that Jewell knew how to calm herself down. She remembered what it was like being a young woman, growing up in the limelight.<br />
Monique and Liberty sat quietly for a few minutes before Liberty broke the silence,<br />
“So... do you want a drink? I checked the fridge earlier, you have orange juice, apple juice-”<br />
“Milk?” Monique said, staring Liberty in the eyes, smirking at her own remark,<br />
“O-or... just water?” Liberty said, nervously.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, Lib. Let’s take this seriously. We don’t need the newbie to be here to keep playing, do we?” Monique said, reaching over and grabbing the dice off the table. She stared in Liberty’s eyes with a devilish smile. She rattled the dice in her hands, then she threw them across the table. Letting them roll right in front of where Jewell would have sat.<br />
The dice rolled perfectly in front of where Jewell’s nipples would have pointed.<br />
<br />
“Be a dear and tell me what I rolled,” Monique asked Liberty.</p>
