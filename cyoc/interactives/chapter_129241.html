<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Sorry for the week long wait. I was gathering my thoughts. For some reason, it was really hard to write this chapter. Though to compensate, this is one of my more longer chapters.<br />
<br />
By the way, when I went back to read the chapter, &quot;Captured!&quot; I realized that the succubus&#39;s name was Rieletta, not Sabrina. I am so Sorry! This is one of the reasons why I reread the old chapters every so often. I can&#39;t believed that I missed that! It&#39;s been awhile since I read that chapter, so I completely forgotten about her real name! When that succubus is eventually reintroduced into this storyline, I&#39;ll make a point to use the right name!<br />
<br />
I also want to make a correction. In the chapter, &quot;What Would Nathan Do?&quot;, there was this sentence: Perhaps the Lexicon has some information on the cloud plane and possible methods of getting stronger with the need to absorb corruption. What I meant to say was: Perhaps the Lexicon has some information on the cloud plane and possible methods of getting stronger without the need to absorb corruption. The keyword is &quot;without&quot;, not &quot;with&quot;. That sentence was saying that Isaac wants to use the lexicon to find methods of getting stronger without the usual means of absorbing other creatures. I just had to clarify that error before another writer takes that out of context. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope you enjoy the chapter. Most of this chapter&#39;s content was written during the last two days.<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
Isaac Evan Wismon sprinted through the cloud forest. Just like when he ran through the forest to find Nat, Isaac allowed his mind to wander. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the cloud shoes and corrupt air he absorbed from the Sky King&#39;s air dragon, he is a lot lighter then he was then when he first arrived in the cloud plane. Though he&#39;s not as light nor as flexible as his formally human self, he is at least as light as Ilivir was when he was a spawn. Meaning Isaac no longer has to worry about sinking through the clouds when he&#39;s standing still. He&#39;s still a lot slower then most cloud people, but he can at least sprint at a reliable pace. <br />
<br />
Though he doesn&#39;t feel much more lighter then he was before his battle with the air dragon. Which is strange. Isaac feels as though he should be a little more lighter then he should. He did absorbed a small portion of the air dragon&#39;s essence... unless...<br />
<br />
Isaac looked down at the metal pouch covering his twin cocks and the baby air dragon.<br />
<br />
...unless... most of the essence absorbed from the air dragon was used to spawn this little guy...<br />
<br />
But Isaac can worry about that later. There&#39;s more recent developments to worry about. <br />
<br />
Who is Alicia? If she can change her appearance, then what is her true form? Or did he already saw her true appearance?<br />
<br />
His suspicions were correct in thinking that the mansion was her property. But that brings up the question on how did she get here.  Does she have a method to traveling to other worlds... or did she happen to step through a portal like he did?<br />
<br />
His two spiritual companions were strongly quiet since Isaac&#39;s second encounter with that witch. Why is that?<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ve seen her before...&#39; Ilivir said out of the blue.<br />
<br />
&#39;W-what ever do you mean?&#39; Isaac mentally inquired.<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t understand how I know ... but I seen her during my time....&#39; Ilivir explained.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac seem to have taken an interest.  &#39;May I ask the circumstance of such a encounter?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;...No... You may not.&#39; Ilivir replied. Ilivir seems to be thinking to himself.<br />
<br />
Isaac decided to direct his attention to someone else.<br />
<br />
&#39;So... Dark Isaac... I seems that she angers you very easily... is there a reason for that?&#39; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course! How dare she takes control away from you! Only I have the right to do that! I must prove that I&#39;m THE REAL ISAAC! I MUST PROVE THAT I&quot;M NOT AN ANOMALY WHO&quot;S DOESN&quot;T SOPPED TO EXSIS-&#39; Dark Isaac cut himself off.<br />
<br />
 Isaac found himself surprised by Dark Isaac&#39;s reaction. It seems that he wants to prove that his existence means something, to prove that he has a identity.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac is seeming less and less like a evil persona and more like a shadow who&#39;s trying to prove that he exists.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac noticed Isaac&#39;s amusement.<br />
<br />
&#39;Alright, you had your fun. If you&#39;re so intersted in what we think, then it&#39;s only right that tell us about your self. listen... have you ever had that feeling were you want to recall a memory with all the answers but no mater what you do, you just can&#39;t?&#39; Dark Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
Isaac was taken aback by Dark Isaac&#39;s question. Dark Isaac must be thinking about how he can&#39;t remember his origin.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Isaac thought hard about Dark Isaac&#39;s question and how it applies to him.<br />
<br />
He found himself thinking about one moment in his life that he can&#39;t seem to recall...<br />
<br />
He thought back to when he was ambushed by that snow-white incubus, a rotting ghoul, a tainted witch, and succubus who ganged up on him back when he was in the crypt. That was when he first discovered his ability to assimilate other creatures. But the way he did it was very unlike the method of using his enchanted equipment or dragging his victims into his chimeric body. That incident was before any of that, and he didn&#39;t had the means nor foresight to do any of that. Instead... he felt white hot rage... then he just blacked out. The next thing he knew, he somehow absorbed all four of his assaulters. But he can&#39;t seem to recall HOW he assimilated them. Did he drag them them into his body... or did something else happened?<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac, able to read Isaac&#39;s thoughts through their mysterious connection, decided to comment.<br />
<br />
&#39;Perhaps it was your ring of purity that saved you? The ring was too small to channel a large amount of the deity of purity&#39;s power. Perhaps the deity temporarily used your body as a larger vessel to protect you?&#39; Dark Isaac theorized. &#39;But take my crazy theories with a grain of salt. I don&#39;t even believe myself half the time.&#39;<br />
<br />
Isaac took Dark Isaac&#39;s suggestion at face value. Perhaps... but if the deity of purity did possessed his body, then would it make more sense for the deity to just disintegrate the corrupted creatures? After all, Isaac doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s in the deity of purity&#39;s nature to absorb corrupt creatures... aak!<br />
<br />
Isaac grabbed his head in  pain as a suppressed memory arisen from the deaths of his mind....<br />
<br />
&#39;Hisssssss.&#39; <br />
<br />
...strange. That&#39;s all he could recall. But for some reason, Isaac knows for sure that memory came from when he was passed out. But were did that hissing sound came from?<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted when he arrived at the front porch of the mansion. All the bags seem to be packed up but there seems to be no sign of Mary. However, the front door seems to be left ajar.<br />
<br />
That bad feeling Isaac had when the lightning storm returned didn&#39;t go away. Mary was against going into that mansion last night. Did Slar make her go in there?<br />
<br />
As a extra precaution, Isaac placed their bags and supplies in his body storage. Wouldn&#39;t want to leave their camp supplies behind. Especially the cloud nap sacks. The sleeping bags was one of the only things that kept Isaac from falling though the ground while he was sleeping... <br />
<br />
That actually gave him an interesting idea. If he&#39;s so afraid of absorbing living things, then maybe he can absorb Nonliving things? He did absorbed his cloud shoes by accident. Maybe he can absorb more cloud items? Perhaps he can even absorb his armor and metal halo too? <br />
<br />
But that can wait till later. He&#39;s got to get Mary out of that mansion first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming Mary.&quot; <br />
<br />
Isaac held out the magic piece of paper that is Alicia&#39;s map. It&#39;s looks just like any old map from the material plane. Except that there was a couple of unnatural black dots of ink moving across the map representing Mary and this &quot;Slar&quot; character. Since both dots are both black, Isaac can&#39;t tell which dot is Mary an which one represents Slar. Good thing that their currently together. But why is this map only showing Isaac the first floor? That mansion looked more then one story tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the second floor?&quot; Inc said out load.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the ink on his map shifted around until it was showing Isaac the mansion&#39;s second floor. It does&#39;t look like there is any moving dots on this floor... Though he does have to question why would one witch would need so many bedrooms...<br />
<br />
Interesting. So the map will show him whichever area he want&#39;s to see just by asking? <br />
<br />
&quot;Show me the first floor.&quot; <br />
<br />
And jut as he commanded, the ink shifted around until it showed the layout of the first floor once again, compete with the two dots representing Slar and Mary. <br />
<br />
Just how much can he do with this map?<br />
<br />
Just on a whim, Isaac asked a question he didn&#39;t expect a answer for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Show me the mansion&#39;s backyard.&quot; Isaac commanded.<br />
<br />
To Isaac&#39;s surprise, the map did indeed changed to show the landscape of the back yard. It appears to be some kind of grave yard. Interesting.<br />
<br />
But what are the rules to using this map? Can he ask for specifics? Can he asked to be shown secret passageways? Is the map sentient? Does it reflects the user&#39;s memories? Perhaps the map can show him some instructions to using it if he asked?<br />
<br />
But he wasted enough time already. While he was thinking to himself, Mary is out there wandering around Alicia&#39;s mansion. He can experiment with his equipment and inventory later. <br />
<br />
He commanded the map to show him the first floor again.<br />
<br />
Isaac entered the mansion with a face full of determination.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Exploring the mansion was surprising calm. <br />
<br />
Because Mary was unable to turn around because of the shot gun to her back, she could only look ahead.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t want to risk angering Slar, but at the same time, she was curious as to what his motives are. <br />
<br />
A few minutes has passed since they last spoke, so perhaps it&#39;s safe to start up a conversation again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; Mary asked bluntly. She&#39;s always been more of the direct type.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t turn around, but she could tell by Slar&#39;s voice that he is amused.<br />
<br />
*Chukle* &quot;You really don&#39;t know when to give in to fear huh? I like your spunk. But you do realize that I can&#39;t just spill my top secret mission to a complete stranger. Things will get more complicated if the King catches wind of it. But I might be more willing to spill the beans to a fellow member...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what are you saying?&quot; Mary replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me. I want you to join the Cloud Crawlers. I may not have seen you fight yet, but I can tell you are no mere damsel in distress. I can tell that you&#39;re a competent fighter just by your attitude. I&#39;m sure the boss can get some use out of you. If someone other then a member of the gang knows about my mission... well... I have to kill them. Can&#39;t let the king know what we are up to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary found herself considering Slar&#39;s offer. She has no intentions of joining the Cloud Crawler Gang but... if she can talk to their leader, then perhaps she can get the cloud crawler&#39;s help in loosening the king&#39;s grip on the kingdom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll consider your offer. But I do want to speak to your leader.&quot; Mary replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha ha. I doubt that the boss is willing to speak to someone other then a member of our gang. But I&#39;ll make things more simpler for you. My mission to find a weapon against dragons.&quot; Slar said out of the blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Does this mean your planing on fighting the king&#39;s air dragon?!&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s true that the &quot;Storm&quot; has been a annoyance to us lately... but that is not the only reason we need a weapon. Things are more... complicated then you think. Lets just say that the King and his air dragon is not the only fish in the barrel. But that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say about that. But now that you sample of what my mission is... you have no choice by to join our gang... otherwise, I&#39;ll just blow you head off.&quot; Star said mater-of-factly.<br />
<br />
Mary felt herself stiffen up. She&#39;s not sure if she should be proud of getting Slar to give her more information, or be frightened by the fact that Slar just blackmailed her into joining the gang. If she doesn&#39;t do something, she might be forced to join.<br />
<br />
Star was amused by Marry&#39;s reaction. &quot;I&#39;ll give you time to think about it. When we leave this mansion, you have to make your choice. Do you die, or do you join us? I&#39;ll leave that up to you. But for time being, you&#39;re useful to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Star seems more smarter then she thought. But Mary was too interested to keep her mouth shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so eager in having me join your gang?&quot; Mary questioned. Star seems a little too friendly to an complete stranger.<br />
<br />
Star in turn scratched his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see... You actually remind me a lot of a little girl I seen back during my days as a Sky Solider days.&quot; Star explained.<br />
<br />
!<br />
<br />
&quot;You worked under the  Sky King?!&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
If Mary could turn around, she would see that Slar wasn&#39;t happy with his past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. A long time ago. But I wasn&#39;t happy with my life. Some men became soldiers so their family can relish on the money they earn. But I had no one to support. It was just me and me alone. But what&#39;s the point of earning money when you spend your who life on duty, not knowing if tomorrow will be the day you die? I lived a empty life, were I could nothing but follow the missions given to me... and I wasn&#39;t happy with everything I done... I had no freedom, nor any free time to do what I really wanted. I wanted to be an writer and a adventurer. But a life as an soldier was the closest to my dream at the time... but being a soldier didn&#39;t give me any time to write, nor was I able to go anywhere then where I was I ordered to go.... I felt restricted... like I was in a cage...I felt like I didn&#39;t have a purpose in life. I rose up in the ranks of the Sky King&#39;s army and became one of their top ranking officers... but at what purpose? I just did my job and I was eventually promoted for my skill... but I didn&#39;t feel proud being such a high rank... I felt trapped. I wanted to quit, but plenty of soldiers who tried were killed on the spot... while others got out scot free... it was a coin flip. It depended on the mood of whoever was releasing you.  I was a coward at the time... so I didn&#39;t risk it...&quot; Slar explained.<br />
<br />
There was moment of silence.<br />
<br />
Mary understood how Slar felt. The people constantly complained how ruthless and out of control the king&#39;s men are... how they are allowed to do whatever they wanted and no one would bat an eye... but that only applies to the lower ranking grunts. In reality, the higher ranking you are, the more restricted life becomes. Sure, you are provided with an upper class life style... but is it worth not being able to step away from what&#39;s expected of you? The royal family especially has it hard... or at least an unfortunate few...<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of soldier were you?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Star&#39;s voice became cold. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter... What&#39;s done is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you to join the Cloud Crawlers?&quot; Mary wanted to change the subject before she gets on Slar&#39;s bad side.<br />
<br />
Slar&#39;s voice brightened instantly. &quot;At the time, the boss was also at the Sky Castle. This was at a time before the Cloud Crawlers even existed. The boss and I felt the same way about our restrictive life styles, so we worked together to escape the castle and start the Cloud Crawler Gang. The Boss became the first member and leader of the gang and I became a freelanced mercenary. My life as an solider sorta programed me into following missions. But now I&#39;m also a free man!  I can choose my own fate! I can choose what missions I want to take and I can write my adventure novels whenever I want! I can finally be what I dreamed of being! To be an adventurer and a writer!&quot; Star proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re a freelanced mercenary, then does that mean your not really a member of the Cloud Crawlers?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Star simply laughed. &quot;Your thinking too hard lady! Of course I&#39;m a member of the boss&#39;s gang! I&#39;m actually the second member! Some even considers me as the boss&#39;s right hand man! But even though I&#39;ll help the boss anyway I can, I&#39;ll do it more as an friend then as an underling. There are plenty times were I&#39;ll go on my own and work for anyone for the right price. I am a freelance mercenary after all!&quot; Star proudly proclaimed. &quot;But right now, I&#39;m doing a few favors for the boss. To find a weapon to fight dragons... and something else... So I&#39;ll ask again. Are you that little girl I saw from the castle years ago?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s face became unreadable. &quot;No. I&#39;m not the girl you&#39;re looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Star doesn&#39;t look convinced. Mary looks like an older version of the girl he saw years ago. &quot;...Okay. I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt... for now. But I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll take you to our boss once this mansion business blows over. I&#39;ll let the boss decide what to do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; Is all she said.<br />
<br />
This man doesn&#39;t know when to stop spilling his secrets. But Mary doesn&#39;t feel like talking anymore. She&#39;s not sure if talking to the Cloud Crawler Gang&#39;s leader was an good idea after all. But then again, she doesn&#39;t who this &quot;boss&quot; is. Their leader might still be a potential ally depending on who that person is. But Mary doesn&#39;t like the idea of Slar knowing dangerous information. <br />
<br />
Slar interpreted Mary&#39;s silence as fear. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Tell you what. We&#39;re both fighters here, aren&#39;t we? You watch my back and I&#39;ll watch you back.&quot; He said rensurenly.<br />
<br />
But Mary didn&#39;t respond. She just wants to stay silent for now. Slar might be willing to devolge more information, but the information she got already is enough for now.<br />
<br />
Slar wasn&#39;t satisfied with how thing are. He&#39;s needs to do something to break the ice if they are going to work together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Giving me the cold shoulder huh? Alright. I suppose I have been a little cold myself. Let me reintroduce myself. My name a Slar. A freelance mercenary and a ally to the Cloud Crawler Gang. And who might you be?&quot; Star offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary&quot; She said simply. <br />
<br />
The girl didn&#39;t say anymore. But Slar is at least satisfied that he knows he name.<br />
<br />
As they silently wandered the mansion, Mary and Slar found themselves walking through a hallway. What made this particular hallway interesting was the fact that there was all kinds of strange relics hanging off the walls. Above each item was a name tag. Some of the items were of cloud plane origin and others were obviously not. The same can be said about the name tags. Some were of cloud touge and others were of a different language.<br />
<br />
Some of the more solid items seems to be from the material plane while others were... well, one item was completely made of fire while another one was completely made of water.  <br />
<br />
As Mary walked through the hallway of artifacts, she was able to read some of the name tags. On name tag said: &quot;The Legend of Beastblood&quot; and is was posted over a scroll. Another tag said: &quot;The Fusionist&#39;s Gloves&quot; and it was hanging over a pair of seemingly ordinary material gloves. Then there was the more bizarre items like a strange handheld device with buttons on it. The name tag above it reads: &quot;Todd&#39;s Remote&quot;. There was also a large wheel hanging from the wall. It looks more like the kind of wheels you see from a carnival. The tag associated with it reads: &quot;Madame Illusia&#39;s Wheel of Change.&quot; Mary found herself seeing a lot of weird objects. Other name tags that caught her eyes had names like: &quot;The Vials&quot;, &quot;The Transform or Dare Curse&quot;, &quot;Food Inc.&#39;s Sandwich-bot&quot;, &quot;The Legend of the Heroic Beast&quot;, &quot;The Chronivac Version 4.0&quot;, ect.<br />
<br />
Strange. Perhaps some of these items can be of use to her later? But for now, she kept on walking.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Eventually, one particular item caught Slar&#39;s interest. Slar stopped in front of a pair of red hand cuffs. The Tag above it simply said: &quot;The Red Cuffs of Fate&quot;<br />
<br />
While Slar was standing still, Mary kept walking away, unable to look back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Star shouted.<br />
<br />
Before Mary could make a run for it, Slar caught up and pressed the mouth of his shot gun against Mary&#39;s back once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t run off like that again!&quot; Star exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t make a sound when you stopped. How would I know that you stopped walking when I can&#39;t turn around?&quot; Mary said pointedly.<br />
<br />
Slar was at a loss for words. The girl had a point. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Star carefully picked up the red handcuff from the wall.<br />
<br />
Before Mary could react, Slar slapped one of the cuffs onto Mary&#39;s wrist. Mary let out an undignified gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Problem solved! This should prevent you from slipping away. That way I don&#39;t have to keep holding my mist scatterer (shot gun) against your back all the time! I prefer walking along side each other without the fear us getting separated anyways.&quot; Slar said out loud.  <br />
<br />
But right before he could close the other cuff around his own wrist...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!&quot; ...someone tackled Slar away from Mary.<br />
<br />

<br />
When Slar turned around, he saw a monster beyond his wildest imagination. WHAT is that? It&#39;s hard for Slar to even describe it.But whatever it is, it looks like some kind of warrior. It has armor and a material sword after all. But what really caught Slar&#39;s attention was that the second cuff somehow managed to fastened itself around the creature&#39;s wrist. <br />
<br />
Shoot! It doesn&#39;t look like there is a key to those cuffs nearby. How can he be so STUPID! He let such a nice woman get chained to an beast! He has to find a way to break those cuffs and get her away from that thing!<br />
<br />
But first Slar needs to take that big guy down...<br />
<br />
As quickly as a shot gun sniper can, Slar aimed his shot gun and fired at the monster in close range...<br />
<br />
But to Slar&#39;s shock, the legendary material bullets didn&#39;t pierce the monster like they did for beings made of clouds... instead they buried themselves into the monster warrior&#39;s body. Yet, the creature treated the metal bullets as a nuisance rather then anything life threatening. <br />
<br />
The strange creature appears to be smiling. <br />
<br />
Before he could reload his gun, the creature&#39;s chest opened up, showcasing all it&#39;s unnatural insides. It was horrific! Weird tentacle like things were everywhere and objects such as sleeping bags wear sticking out!<br />
<br />
Slar nearly died of fright!.. But he can&#39;t die yet. Not now.<br />
<br />
Slar reloaded his gun as he ran towards the monster! <br />
<br />
&quot;GET AWAY FROM HER YOU MONSTER!!!&quot; Star shouted his war cry.<br />
<br />
As if he was in some kind of action movie, Slar ran up to the monster and fired his double barreled shot gun into the monster&#39;s exposed insides! This time, the monster seems visibly in pain as it staggered and fallen on it&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
With the monster temporarily disabled, Slar ran up up to Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary was just standing there with her mouth wide open.<br />
<br />
Star grabbed Mary&#39;s hand. &quot;Come on! Let&#39;s get that dragon weapon and get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
But to Slar&#39;s dismay, Mary was yanked away by the red cuff chains attached to the beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot!&quot; The creature was starting to stir. Already, some of the holes opened up by his gun is already closing up again.<br />
<br />
Slar hastily reloaded his gun again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, hold this.&quot; Slar told Mary to hold out the red chain while he aimed his shotgun. <br />
<br />
Things were going by so fast that Mary didn&#39;t had time to rspond.<br />
<br />
Slar took aim at the red chain and... <br />
<br />
 *BANG*<br />
<br />
...When the imaginary dust settled, Slar and Mary stared in shock as the red chain connecting Mary and the monster remained completely intact! Yet, all the bullets fired from Slar&#39;s trusty gun were embedded throughout the hallway!<br />
<br />
Oh deities, what have he done? He got a girl chained to a monster and his most powerful gun can break it. What are those cuffs made out of?!<br />
<br />
His face filled with panic and guilt, he silently slipped a military knife out of hidden compartment in his cloud boots. <br />
<br />
He gently placed the knife in Mary&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a idiot for tossing away your sword. Use this knife to defend yourself from that monster. I... don&#39;t think even my gun can take that thing out. I&#39;ll be back with a weapon strong enough knock it&#39;s arm off so you can escape.&quot; Slar started running away.<br />
<br />
Mary found herself stammering. &quot;W-wait you idiot! You don&#39;t understand! This is my f-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tust me! I&#39;ll be back!&quot; Star shouted from the distance. <br />
<br />
As Slar turned the corner, Slar gave Mary a brave, warm smile. <br />
<br />
For the first time since he found it, his material mist scatterer (shot gun) didn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
Ashamed of his wounded pride, Slar just kept on running...<br />
<br />
He&#39;s got to find those rumored weapons before Mary becomes monster chow!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Mary was left standing with a dumbfounded look on her face. Slar was a lot less cold hearted then she initially thought. He was actually very kind hearted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; She said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my question.&quot; Isaac said. As he sat up, he was casually picking the material bullets out of his opened up chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isaac?!&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get you and Slar out of here.&quot; Isaac informed.<br />
<br />
He held out the held out Alicia&#39;s map<br />
<br />
Slar&#39;s dot was getting father and farther away from them by the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll talk later. But first, we need to get you two out of this mansion.&quot; Isaac repeated.<br />
<br />
But as he started sprinting towards Slar&#39;s location, Mary&#39;s wrist was yanked by the red cuffs still chained to Isaac&#39;s wrists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaa!&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Oh. <br />
<br />
Isaac tried  breaking the chains, but just like Slar before him, the red chains wouldn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
&#39;Try checking the Lexicon. It might have some information on how to take off the cuffs.&#39; Ilivir suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Lexicon?&quot; Mary asked. And why did she hear Ilivir&#39;s voice just now?<br />
<br />
Isaac ignored Mary as he pulled out the Lexicon from his body storage. The red cuffs may not be on Isaac&#39;s person for long, but it seems that the Lexicon already has information on it. What appeared in the lexicon was a legend:<br />
<br />
&quot;Once upon a time, there were two kingdom who shared the same country. For many years, the two kingdoms were at war over the land they live on. Eventually, a group of wizards from an eastern land were fed up with the conflict, so they created a pair of red hand cuffs connected with a red chain that&#39;s designed to create a bond of understanding between two people. One night, they arranged for the queen of one kingdom and the king of another kingdom to meet. That was when the wizards sprung their trap. They handcuffed the two archenemies together and told them that a key was never made.<br />
<br />
They told them the following conditions: <br />
<br />
- The Cuffs were designed to force two people together until they form a natural bond of understanding.<br />
- The Cuffs will only open if the bond between the two people is strong enough to stay intact even when they are separated.<br />
- Depending on the two people, special magical side effects may occur. <br />
- Examples of Side Effects includes but not limited to: A telepathic link, the ability to sense each other&#39;s emotions, to view the other person&#39;s memories, or in extreme cases, fuse the two people together to form a new person.<br />
- Not every side effect will appear for every pairing. The effects tend to be unique for each pairing.<br />
<br />
For the King and Queen, who were one bitter rivals at first, became lovers. The two virgins lovers eventually married and merged the kingdoms together.<br />
<br />
THE END<br />
<br />
The strange legend ends there.<br />
<br />
&#39;Does this mean you have mental connection to that girl?&#39; Dark Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. I am hearing your voice even though you not actually specking.&quot; Mary responded to Dark Isaac&#39;s mental question.<br />
<br />
Isaac turned to Mary in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can hear them?!&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s &quot;them&quot;? You and I are the only ones in this hallway.&quot; Mary replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Isaac responded.<br />
<br />
How is Isaac going to explain this?<br />
<br />
______________<br />
<br />
Note: Please bare in mind that there are references to other CYOC stories in this chapter. They&#39;re mostly just fun little references and are by no means a sign of disrespect. All ideas are credited to their respected writers. In terms of the story, Alicia CAN travel to other worlds, so it&#39;s not unreasonable for her to come across alternate universe versions of those items.<br />
<br />
I would like to mention that I didn&#39;t make up Isaac&#39;s middle name. If you look WAY back at the chapter, &quot;Isaac bears fruit&quot;, the writer of that chapter kept calling Isaac, &quot;Evan&quot; for some strange reason. I just took that idea and ran with it. I originally intended for Evan to be Isaac&#39;s last name. After all, it makes more sense for Isaac to refer to himself by his last name then his middle name. Not to mention the question on wether middle names even existed during Isaac&#39;s time. I was meaning to mention his last name myself during one of my chapters, but it looks like ChronoSeth beaten me by giving Isaac a last name. Oh well. I&#39;m sure someone will come up with a reason for Isaac to occasionally refer to himself by his middle name someday.  I do like Wismon as a last name.<br />
<br />
The idea for Slar being a former sky solider came from the chapter, &quot;Issac ,Ilvir and a disgruntled Sky Castle soldier associnate the Sky King&quot; by an anonymous writer. That writer does come up with decent and creative ideas. But I also pick and choose what Ideas I borrow from that writer. I didn&#39;t think much of Slar&#39;s backstory at first, but then that chapter had an interesting idea about him being a solider.  So thank you to the writer of that chapter for the idea!<br />
<br />
The chapter, &quot;Getting closer to the Castle&quot; made a good point about Isaac and Mary not knowing each other very well. Though I&#39;m not ready to reveal all the I have planed for Mary&#39;s mysterious backstory, I am willing to play around with Isaac&#39;s and Mary&#39;s relationship. So thank you to the anonymous writer of that chapter for bringing up that point.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note is that I have no plans of killing off or having Isaac absorb Slar. At least not right now. I intend for Slar to be a reoccurring rival character or a companion. Though if you want Isaac to absorb some bandits, those nameless thugs are free pickings...<br />
<br />
To the anoymous  writer of &quot;The Sky Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Getting closer to the Castle&quot;, I really respect your writing. I&#39;m very tempted to add on to your storyline. But I want to follow your suggestion and flesh out  and expand the mountain story arc in this storyline and add my own flare to it. I really miss working with you, and I might possibly add a couple of chapters to your storyline depending on the situation... but I want to work on this storyline and write my own version of events. And there is a bunch of my own ideas and story arcs I want to write out too. No to mention existing ideas I want to expand on.  Either way, I look forward to what you have to offer on your storyline.<br />
<br />
To ChronoSeth, Thank you for your support. I really appreciate it. I&#39;ll try to get better at not making the story feel overwhelming. In other words, I&#39;ll try not to have too many things happening at once. Thank you for your concern and I look forward to working with you in the future!<br />
<br />
It appears that each of us has our own ideas on what to do for Isaac&#39;s story. Which is perfectly fine! Let&#39;s work together and blend our ideas together! And the first step to doing that is communication. If I made any continuity mistakes or did something to interfere with another writer&#39;s plans, please let me know!<br />
<br />
Also, I apologize for sometimes taking awhile to write chapters. Sometimes it takes awhile to write a chapter and other times, chapters are easy to write and doesn&#39;t take very long. I hope I&#39;m not taking too long. I don&#39;t want to hold other writers up. It&#39;s just that sometimes I have to balance between rushing out a chapter, taking my time, and just simply having writer&#39;s block and needing some time to gather my thoughts.<br />
<br />
I hope this chapter wasn’t too messy! I also hope it didn&#39;t drag itself out too much. Either way, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!<br />
<br />
Any help with this storyline is appreciated. Heck, any help with any storyline for this story is appreciated.</p>
