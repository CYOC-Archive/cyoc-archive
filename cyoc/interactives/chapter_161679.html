<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The warm sunlight seeped into the room through the large windows, shining onto the bed. I woke up, seeing Joe already standing by the door. I could see his bulge tenting his boxers, as the boy was sporting a prominent morning wood. I was as well, however when I tried to hide mine, Joe seemed more comfortable with showing his off. I could hear him talking to Pat, but I only managed to catch the last things they said.<br />
<br />
“C’mon. I’m sure Jamie will love it.”<br />
“He would, but I wouldn’t.”<br />
“Then let him come and you can stay here.”<br />
“No.”<br />
“Suit yourself. Tell him everyone said hi.”<br />
<br />
As Joe closed the door, he saw me sitting up on the bed, looking out the window onto the town. He smiled.<br />
<br />
“Good morning.”<br />
“Hey.”<br />
“Did you sleep well.”<br />
“Very well. What time is it?”<br />
“5.a.m.”<br />
“Wow, so this is what 5.a.m looks like. Who was at the door?”<br />
“Pat. He invited us to join the boys on a morning jog around the house.”<br />
“Oh, I hate jogging.”<br />
“It’s nude jogging.”<br />
“Well, in that case-“<br />
“Gross!”<br />
<br />
He threw a pillow at me as I giggled. As he walked across the room, I could see his morning wood bounce, refusing to go down, as it poked 8 inches through his underwear. I was already turned on from last night, my balls aching for release. Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, watching the morning news. He laid on the bed next to me, on his phone. I would find myself catching a glimpse at his impressively tented boxers. He was never this open about his cock. Usually, around me, he’d keep it covered up, thinking I’d pounce on him at any moment if I saw it. But there he was, almost waving it in my face, like an invitation to reach out and grab it. A short while later, I saw him spread his thighs apart as he looked at me.<br />
<br />
“All the guys say hi by the way. They can’t wait to meet you.”<br />
“I can’t wait to meet them. When’s breakfast?”<br />
“In about an hour.”<br />
“I’ll have a shower then.”<br />
“Better grab it quick. There’s only one bathroom for the whole corridor, and they usually use it for orgies.”<br />
<br />
I laughed, but I saw his face had remained still.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t joking.”<br />
“Oh, so are they all like constantly horny or something?”<br />
“Probably. They’ve always been like that. I remember always walking in on them mid-fuck. They never stopped.”<br />
“Lucky you.” <br />
“No, not lucky. If they were all hot women, then maybe…”<br />
<br />
His voice trailed off. I could see his cock throb in his boxers as he rubbed it absent-mindedly. Silence quickly fell on us, as I watched him begin to jerk off before my very eyes.<br />
<br />
“Looks like that overactive sexdrive runs in the family.”<br />
“What? OH-“<br />
<br />
He shot up from the bed, covering his crotch with a pillow. I laughed as he squirmed, embarrassed. His arms, which now looked bigger than yesterday, flexed as he held the pillow in front of his boner.<br />
<br />
“Sorry man. I don’t know what came over me.”<br />
“It’s fine. You don’t usually do that anyway.”<br />
“I hope I didn’t lead you on or anything.”<br />
“I said it’s fine.”<br />
“It’s just that, I’m straight and-“<br />
“IT’S FINE!”<br />
<br />
My playful attitude suddenly turned to anger. I wasn’t expecting my voice to come out so dominant, and I don’t think Joe did either. He stared at me with his big, beautiful eyes. Scowling, I grabbed my towel and left without saying another word. He had no idea I’ve had a huge crush on him for a while, which hurts even more. I’d rather he knew and had rejected me, than not know at all. However, I pretty much took that exchange as a rejection. As I walked down the corridor, clutching my towel, I could feel the floor rumble under my feet. The sounds of heavy footsteps approached. It must be the boys back from their jog. Whilst I was tempted to see them fully naked, I dashed into the bathroom, locking the door. I gasped as a heavy smell of musk filled my nostrils.<br />
<br />
Despite the mansion’s tremendous size, the bathroom was tiny. There was barely enough room for a toilet, a sink, and a shower in the corner, surrounded by glass walls. Dirty clothes were piled high in a corner, and the sink was littered with hair. Huge splotches of cum covered the walls, especially around the toilet. The shower wasn’t any better, as the semen on the walls were slowly dripping down slowly onto the shower floor. Carefully avoiding it, I climbed into the shower, and felt a hot stream of water run down my body. Finally, I could get some peace and quiet, and I quickly lost myself in my thoughts. I pictured Aku’s hulking frame crushing me as he thrusted his monstercock into my ass. The very notion of that sent my hormones raging, as I felt myself on the brink of orgasm. Suddenly, I heard the door to the bathroom shake violently as a huge fist pounded on it. A deep voice boomed from the other side.<br />
<br />
“Let me in, quick!”<br />
“There’s someone already in here!”<br />
“Ohhhh God I’m close, open the door!”<br />
<br />
Frustrated, I stepped out of the shower and reluctantly unlocked the door. As it swung open, I felt a huge arm push me to one side, throwing me onto the wall. It was one of Joe’s brothers, but this one was different. He was taller than the rest, at 9ft, and his python shot out 2 ½ ft across the small bathroom. I could see his brown skin was drenched with sweat, thick droplets of his juices trickling down his face, and into his beard. He tried to reach the shower, but was too late. He roared immensely loud, as his cock shot huge, thick ropes of his seed on the bathroom mirror. I couldn’t help but stand and watch in awe. His grunts were deep, and powerful, like a lion. He could see my comparatively tiny boner, and as he shot his last load, he quickly turned to face me. There we stood, the room grew hotter as the heat from his fresh seed and musclebound frame radiated onto me. My sweat began to mix with the shower water that was still dripping from my slightly trembling body. Breathing heavily, he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. Father would kill me if I did that in the hallway. You must be Jamie.”<br />
“How did you-“<br />
“Steve told us about you. He’s right, you’re cute as fuck. God, I’d tear you apart.”<br />
<br />
I was lost for words. He smirked, taking a small step closer to me. I could feel my cock throb greatly, desperate to cum. The man could sense my pent up energy.<br />
<br />
“Father said we can’t have sex with you yet, but this won’t count…”<br />
<br />
He lunged towards me, shoving his tongue down my throat. Before I could even protest, I felt his tight grip around my shaft. Having never had a handjob before, I was instantly lost in a world of pleasure as his giant hand pumped my cock. The other hand grabbed my butt, squeezing it hard. It wasn’t long before I came too, shooting my load onto the floor. My muffled moans filled his ears, as we continued to make out a few minutes after. When he suddenly broke from the kiss, I almost collapsed on the floor, my knees shaking. It all happened so quickly.<br />
<br />
“You’re a pretty good kisser. If you want me to do that again, lemme know. Or ask anyone else. They’re all dying to do you.”<br />
“I….please, fuck me.”<br />
“Sorry man, can’t do that yet.”<br />
“Yet?”<br />
“Uhhh, I gotta go.”<br />
“Wait! What’s your name?”<br />
“I’m Jim. You’ll be seeing more of me little bro.”<br />
<br />
He left the bathroom as quickly as he entered. I was still in shock. I just had the best orgasm of my life, and it wasn’t even 8.a.m! But what did he mean by ‘yet’? And Father told them that? My mind raced as I reached down for my pyjamas. Noticing they were drenched in Jim’s cum, I picked them up, and wrapped a towel around my waist, entering the corridor. The hallway was empty, except the sounds of the brothers having wild sex in their rooms quickly filled the space. I felt incredibly vulnerable, feeling the cool air nip my bare skin. hearing their intense moans and screams of pleasure turned me on already. I could hear Jim in one room fucking I assume was his husband. They really are horny all the time. One door rattled violently, as Steve’s voice boomed from behind it.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! HARDER! OHHHHH-“<br />
“ARGHHHHH!!”<br />
<br />
The door gradually shook more and more violently, until it suddenly stopped. My eyes widened as I saw a large puddle of cum slowly flow into the corridor. I didn’t think I could be more in shock, until I opened our bedroom door. Joe was on the bed, completely naked. His clothes in a pile beside him on the floor. With his legs far apart, he was humping his cock into his hands. I could see his fingers were wet with his precum. I looked at the TV to see 2 women making out in a sauna. His animalistic grunts must’ve hidden the sound of the door opening, since he didn’t notice me enter. However, when I slammed the door shut, he quickly turned his head to see me standing there in a towel. His face looked shock, as he frantically tried to move off the bed, still jerking off.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, Jamie I-OHHHHH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Before he could stop himself, huge streams of his seed shot onto his chest. Load after load drenched his abs with his cum, and when he eventually stopped he looked too exhausted to move. It’s like he knew there was not point in hiding it anymore. I noticed his balls were way bigger than I thought they would be. His feet were planted at the edge of the bed, and I saw a thin layer of hair had sprouted on his legs. I always thought they were hairless. It seemed like the wrong time to ask about it now.<br />
<br />
“Jamie, I-WAIT!”<br />
<br />
Without speaking, I just grabbed my clothes from my suitcase, and dashed back into the bathroom to change for breakfast.</p>
