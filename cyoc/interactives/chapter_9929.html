<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Uncle returned to his ointment shop the new day was dawning. He scrolled out his small awning above the doorway and with a yawn went to find some tea.<br />
<br />
Lucky for the old man but it was a slow morning with not one customer. A time to doze and plan for who might come looking for fun and fantasy. It was about 1:15pm. when the tinkle of that silver bell above his front door rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I serve you?' asked the proprietor, Uncle.<br />
<br />
There standing and looking around was a large and very tall man. he looked as one of authority and Uncle wondered why such would come to see him?<br />
<br />
&quot;John Ranslin, Fire Marshall, I'm looking for a young lad who started the fire yesterday at Leesong's grocery!&quot; announced the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leesong's had a fire yesterday, oh I was out of town and just returned this very morning! I keep an eye out for him, you have a photo perhaps?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
Quickly the man drew out a photo from his inside coat pocket. &quot;The Leesong family has posted a reward of $20,000. so it's to your benefit to turn him over, understand ole' man?' asked the Fire Marshall.<br />
<br />
Uncle stood with one eye glaring at the man who stained his self with the words &quot;Ole' Man&quot;. &quot;excuse me dear Sir but in you life have you ever felt the want of desire to live a fantasy?&quot; asked the Uncle.<br />
<br />
The big man looked at Uncle and without a word walked out the shop and down the alley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, a perfect man, all work and no play!&quot; said uncle as he watched the man walk out of sight.<br />
<br />
Thud, splat, and a moan came from the far rear of the shop. Slowly stood up a young and thin person as the Uncle stood and watched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, for not giving me to the Cop!&quot; said the dark figure.<br />
<br />
Uncle walked closer to this person and looking him over he had to ask, &quot;Your the one who started the fire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no, I was the one who knocked up Wynn the daughter of Leesong who own's the grocery. When he demanded I marry the girl I said no and in the ruckus he knocked over the insense burner into the paper towels. I ran, he fought the fire, now I'm accused of being an arsonist, just great!&quot; said the dark figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to hide then till this all blows over?&quot; asked Uncle with a crinkled evil smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What with $20,000. on my head you ask if I need a place to hide? Hell, I need a whole to crawl in and cover me up for the next three years, then they can't get me at all!&quot; replied the young man.<br />
<br />
Uncle stood there thinking and then, &quot;I know Leesong and from my past we have disagreed on many things! I will help you get past your troubles, indeed I have a plan.&quot; said Uncle as he turned and walked toward his counter and cash register.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll help me, an unknown, why?&quot; asked the young person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's say I can help you and thus you can repay my generousity by going to work for my Nephew. He lives outside the city in Lawson county, he has a farm where few ever visit!' told Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;A farm? I'd live and work on a stinking farm?&quot; asked the person still as yet unknown.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is an offer, you have a better one?' asked Uncle with a smirk.<br />
<br />
The young person looked down saying, &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good then we begin to find the perfect hiding place for one who wants nobody to recognize him for three years, hmmmm!&quot; said Uncle as he walked an isle of his shop.<br />
<br />
Turning suddenly, Uncle asked, &quot;You tired and hungry no doubt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I've been running and staying away from people all yesterday and last night. Heck, I can't go home the landlady would sell me for the reward in a second!&quot; replied the person.<br />
<br />
&quot;You live alone?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, but it was me and Wynn! Oh but she's not coming to live with me as her Father plans to send her to a convent or something. So I'm alone and at the mercy of those who'd want me dead or in prison.&quot; confessed the young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, you like animals?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, oh you mean out of your Nephew's farm! Yea, I had a dog once!&quot; replied the young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never a farm animal or some fantasy desire to wonder what it might be like?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Farm animal, fantasy, what are you driving at Mister?&quot; replied the young man again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come we get you food and rest, talk later, come.&quot; said the Uncle.<br />
<br />
The young man stood there looking down and then turning toward Uncle asked, &quot;Your plan to hide me, make me so nobody will recognize me, and have me live on your Nephew's farm, as what?&quot; asked the young man as his voice got a little more forceful till it sounded angry.<br />
<br />
Uncle stopped and turned slowly as he leaned against the cash counter. &quot;My offer is simple for you and requires little effort, but grants much pleasure requiring your willingness, are you willing or would you rather talk with the Fire Marshall?' asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;China town, and Ointment shop, your offer to hide me an unknown, and you want me to be willing but for what?' asked the young man now looking rather shaken.<br />
<br />
Uncle smiled, &quot;Calm down, now let's look at what we have here. Your an accused felon,  to get past the three year limit a good hiding place you need, correct? A place I have but as you are someone might recognize the face and make a trade for $20,000. correct? So we need to make some change which would keep those seeking from finding while at the same time granting you a place to live, correct?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes to all points, but what are you going to do to my face?&quot; asked the nervous young man.<br />
<br />
Uncle laughs, &quot;Your face yes, but there are finger prints, dental records, all these must be put to rest that you are dead or just gone from the face of this earth.&quot; says Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Punch line, what are you planning for me?' asked the shaking and very nervous young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again I ask if you liked Horses, Goats, or some farm type animals, hmmm?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait just on darn minute! Hey, are you suggesting that your ointments and or potions would change me from myself to some farm animal?&quot; screamed the young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would do the trick, you have an alternitive!&quot; said Uncle slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no I don't like the alternitive! Yet I'm not wild over what your suggesting either! If I go along with this what would I be, what whould happen?&quot; asked the young man.<br />
<br />
Uncle reached down behind the counter and pulled out a long legal form. The heading said, &quot;Power of Attorney&quot;.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please sign here and grant me power of attorney in fact over your owned property. Then I will have you lay down and drink a potion which to all who would look at you shall never know it is you. I call Nephew and he come pick you up and drive out to farm. There for the next three years you live and sometimes maybe work. You also given to pleasures as being a verile male animal the need to rut will be strong. Then when time limit done I give potion and you slowly return to yourself without aging one day, agreed?&quot; asked Uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed I guess!' replied the young man.</p>
