<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go back to our place!&quot; Ky shouted.<br />
<br />
As all eight bodies rose from their seats, their sixteen legs began to move the boys towards Ty&#39;s, Ky&#39;s, Dustin&#39;s, and Justin&#39;s home. It was weird to think that these boys and friends were simply regular guys just moments ago; now, each boy was a conjoined twin, with each guy having two legs, two arms, a body twice as wide, and two heads on their shoulders. As their legs moved the boys, their sixteen heads were excited to find out what would happen now.<br />
 <br />
When the boys arrived at the house, they were greeted by Mark and Clark, both of whom were headed upstairs to their study. June, May, and April were reading in the parlor, so the gang moved downstairs to the living room. Once inside, it was clear to Ty and his siblings that this room had changed just as much as the dining room and their dads&#39; study. The seat furniture was wider here as well, as if two people--regular people with no conjoined twin--could occupy each seat simultaneously. There were also snacks laid out, and there were twice as many as usual. Clearly the dads and moms had figured that their sons would be bringing their conjoined friends over--plus, as they remembered, each boy now had two heads, and therefore two mouths.<br />
<br />
As the boys sat, ate, talked, and watched TV, they were amazed by their new experience; with two heads each, they were able to do all of these activities at the same time!<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s pretty cool that you were able to make every one of us have two heads,&quot; said Donnie.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that you were able to bring all of us into existence,&quot; said Johnny, Donnie&#39;s conjoined twin.<br />
<br />
It did not take long for several of the guys to ask for more heads. Ty and Ky were skeptical, but believed that it could happen. The gang decided that first, they would need a test subject to see what would happen; that&#39;s when Mark and Clark called the boys from down the hall. As the dads&#39; footsteps grew louder, the boys agreed that the two would be a perfect test subject for this experiment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick, before they open the door!&quot; Leo whispered.<br />
<br />
As the doorknob began to turn, Ty and Ky quickly whispered the following wish: &quot;I wish that Mark and Clark had been born with another conjoined twin, and that everyone believes that they have always been like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as the two had finished their wish, Mark and Clark entered the room. They were happy to see the two-headed boys, but then they appeared as though they were uncomfortable with their shirt&#39;s one neck-hole being stretched between their necks. Each reached their one hand to grab either end of the hole, and began to stretch to out even more. As they did so, the shirt began to become even wider--not from stretching fabric, but from the power of the wish. Mark and Clark&#39;s pants began to grow wider as well, along with their legs and torso--as if there were three legs in each pants leg and three people in the shirt. However, Mark and Clark did not even notice these changes--Ty and Ky had wished for everyone to believe that their dads had been born with three heads. Then, while the two dads were adjusting the now-wider neck-hole of their now-wider shirt, their heads began to shift towards their left-hand side. A lump then began to grow near the right shoulder, forming into a third head with a neck anchoring the hole in its new position.<br />
<br />
When the dads had finished, they acted as though nothing had happened to them. The boys tried to act and look as though nothing had happened to the dads, which wasn&#39;t easy for a few of them. A few seconds ago, there were only two heads in front of them; now, there were three identical heads on one wide body. From their left-hand side to their right, the men were Mark, Clark, and Scott--apparently there were no other names that rhymed with Mark or Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your moms asked us to check on you,&quot; said Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; asked Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem surprised,&quot; Scott said.<br />
<br />
After a while, Ty got an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just surprised to see you,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah, we weren&#39;t expecting anyone,&quot; said Ky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, just make sure you clean up your mess when you&#39;re done,&quot; Clark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want to clean them up for you,&quot; said Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dads,&quot; said Dustin and Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you at dinner,&quot; Mark said, &quot;and you boys can join us if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s nice to have fellow conjoined siblings for company,&quot; said Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll think about it,&quot; said Mike.<br />
<br />
As soon as the three-headed dads shut the door, the boys instantly began talking about what had happened. At the present time, it seemed that the wishes and conjoined siblings weren&#39;t dangerous, weird, or uncomfortable in any way. In one house alone, there was a three-headed man, a three-headed woman, two two-headed brothers, and their six two-headed friends.<br />
<br />
Ty and Ky, Dustin and Justin, Ralph and Rob, Donnie and Johnny, Mike and Mark, Leo and Luke, Peter and Paul, and James and John.<br />
<br />
There was now another question being pondered and asked by all of them: what could and would happen now?</p>
