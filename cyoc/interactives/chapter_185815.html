<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you wake up you realize you&#39;re no longer in your own room at the resort with your girlfriend, but you also had no idea where you were because the place was so dark you couln&#39;t see a thing. You got up and tried to explore the place, all with some difficulty because the floor was concave and very malleable. Walking around the place you realize you were in some kind of big, round room, and apparently you were alone because you hadn&#39;t bumped into or heard anyone around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ellen, are you there? If you can hear me say something.&quot; you yelled but got no answer<br />
<br />
You kept looking for an exit or someone else you were with and, after a while, you noticed that the whole room seemed to have started to sway slightly. With the movement of the floor it became more difficult to stand up, especially after it started to get wet, making you slip and fall.<br />
<br />
Things were getting more complicated as what the wet stuff on the floor was increasing was starting to fill the room. &quot;Hi. Is anyone there? Get me out of here, this room is being flooded.&quot; you screamed to have no answer again. When the level of the liquid reached the height of your waist, the swaying of the room became more intense and the pace at which the depth increased also accelerated. Soon you were covered up to your chest and had to start swimming so you wouldn&#39;t drown, which made you more worried about how long you could last. When the liquid almost completely filled the room you no longer had to stretch your arm to reach the ceiling and the swaying of the room was fine, it made the same splash in all directions.<br />
<br />
You no longer knew where you were, or how long or how deep of flooding you were experiencing when the entire room made a sudden movement, as if it had been thrown to a specific side, and stopped at once. At the same time the liquid level started to drop quickly because it was being pulled in a specific direction, you tried to swim in the opposite direction because you were being pulled together and you didn&#39;t know what and where it would go, but the suction was too strong and you ended up being pulled. You realized that you had ended up in some pipe, but for a few seconds before you came out on the other side and was hurled far away. You tried to see where you came out since the other side wasn&#39;t dark, but the difference in lighting was so big that you couldn&#39;t keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
For a fraction of a second you felt like you were floating before you were sure you were in a free fall which, judging by the duration, was a considerable height. You prepared for the impact with the ground, but ended up hitting something very soft. You stayed where you were until your eyes got used to the illumination and you could open them, only then could you see where you were. <br />
<br />
You saw that you were near the beach in a very high place and you had to be very careful not to lose your balance, but when you looked where you were stepping you found the texture strange and said &quot;Is this skin?&quot; then you looked down into the ravine and saw a huge and very familiar pink thing before saying &quot;It can not be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think? Did you like it?&quot; Suddenly you heard Ellen&#39;s voice say from above.<br />
<br />
You looked in the direction your girlfriend&#39;s voice came from and you got scared, Ellen was just huge. You looked more closely and saw that the ravine you were standing on was actually one of her breasts, which she was holding underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where had you gone Ellen? And when did you get this big?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been with you the entire time. Now tell me, what did you think of the room you were in?&quot; your girlfriend said<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I answer this? I don&#39;t even know where I was and inside it was too dark for me to see anything.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? So let me show you where you were.&quot; Ellen said, so she put you on her hand, which was so big that probably dozens of people could stand on it if they got in trouble, and lowered you down so you could see her full-length. She was still almost exactly the way she was the night before when you went to sleep, the only difference being that she was gigantic. Every part of her body had kept the perfect proportions for the new size. &quot;You were in there.&quot; your girlfriend said, stopping with you in front of her ballsack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was I inside your balls?&quot; You asked impressed. she still had four testicles, each of which was now easily the size of a city bus. You also looked impressed at her hard cock, which was at least 200 feet long.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. I started jacking off after I felt you had woken up and you left with my cum when I came.&quot; Ellen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I was totally freaked out not knowing what was going on.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you, but so are we even for you fucking my ass when I wasn&#39;t ready for it yet.&quot; Ellen said</p>
