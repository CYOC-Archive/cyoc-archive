<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">8 year old Jamie was running from his older brother Sam after accidentally spilling some soda onto his shirt in the mall food court. Jamie would normally have stayed away from his older brother but they had both come to see a movie at the mall’s theater. Jamie trying to lose Sam slipped into a dark storefront hoping that Sam wouldn’t have seen him enter. After seeing Sam run past the entrance not seeming to have noticed Jamie’s entrance, Jamie turns around to look at the shop he just entered. The store looked like it had been there for a hundred years with a visible layer of dust and old wooden furniture. The store felt different from all of the other stores in the mall with nobody inside of it that he could see. Jamie was about to leave when he was startled by something behind him. Where there had just been an empty desk now sat an old woman who had just asked him who he was hiding from. Tentatively Jamie approached her and answered her saying he was hiding from his older brother. The woman then introduced herself as Miriam and questioned why boys these days didn’t treat their younger siblings nicer. Jamie then told Miriam of all the bullying that Sam had put him through. After listening to Jamie’s story Miriam walked over to one of her shelves and brought over what looked like a fancy old necklace. Miriam explained that what she had was the talisman of Hypnos and had it could help him with his problem. She then explained how it worked and gave it to Jamie wishing him good luck. Before Jamie could protest or ask any more questions he was ushered out of the store. When he turned back after leaving the store was a blank wall with no sign of the store he had just been in. <br />
<br />
Jamie had missed the movie and was forced to wait for his parents to come and pick him and his brother up after the movie had ended. Jamie had kept the talisman hidden to prevent his brother from taking it and waited for the right time to try it out. Jamie got his chance sooner than he thought he would. When they got home the parents had to leave for a high school reunion party and wouldn’t be home until late that night. Sam was put in charge and pizza was ordered for dinner. After the boys had eaten Jamie went to the living room couch to watch something on the tv. Before he could put something on Sam vaulted the couch and landed on Jamie. The two then wrestled for a while ending with Sam sitting on Jamie’s head and rubbing his crotch in the younger boy’s face. Sam then got off and Jamie scrambled away to his room almost in tears. <br />
<br />
Enough was enough and Jamie was going to make his brother pay for what had just happened. With talisman in hand he walked back to the living room where Sam had taken control of the tv. Sam hadn’t expected to see Jamie again that night and was about to yell at him when something caught his eye. The sight of the swinging talisman in Jamie’s hand killed the response that Sam had been about to say and his mind grew blank. After seeing the now blank expression on his brother’s face Jamie was filled with excitement and relief that he would now be the one in control. The first thing Jamie did was ask for Sam to turn of the tv and get on his hands and knees. Sam without protest turn the tv off with the remote and got onto the ground and looked up to Jamie. Putting the talisman around his own neck Jamie walked over and sat on his brother’s back. At 13 years old and 4 feet 8inches tall Sam was easily able to support his 5 years younger and 8 inch shorter brother. <br />
<br />
Jamie spent the next 10 minutes forcing Sam to take him around the living room on his back. Jamie then had Sam act as a dog, having him beg, roll over, and drink water from a bowl on the floor. It was then that Jamie started his plan to change Sam for good. Jamie had Sam to strip down and expose himself in a spread squat. Jamie had also removed his pants and underwear in preparation for what he would do next. He then viewed his totally submissive brother in the lewd pose he had requested. Jamie had hoped to find his brother with a tiny cock that he could make fun of but Sam was average at about 5 inches long. Jamie himself was only 4 inches long and lacking in the girth department. Nevertheless Jamie made Sam start sucking his cock and fingering his own ass. Jamie was determined to make Sam have a hands free orgasm before the hypnosis ended so when he felt near to orgasm Jamie had Sam stop sucking and turn around and present his rear to him. Jamie forcefully shoved himself into his older brother and grabbed his arms pulling them back towards him. It didn’t take long Jamie to blow his load into Sam’s ass and when he looked he was rewarded with the sight of cum from his brother’s untouched cock on the ground in front of him. <br />
<br />
Jamie knew he was running out of time but he had one last thing he wanted to do before letting Sam go. He ran up to his parent’s room and went for his mother’s underwear drawer. After a bit of searching Jamie found a pair of smaller panties and something that he would want to use the next time he hypnotized Sam. With panties in hand he returned to the living room which he had Sam clean while he was in his parent’s room. Jamie then had Sam put the panties on and the rest of his clothes on except for his old underwear. Sam was then instructed to forget what had happened between them this evening and to believe that he had wanted to try the panties on himself. After that Jamie let Sam go back to watching tv and returned to his room.<br />
