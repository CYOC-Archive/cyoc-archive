<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unsatisfied with the potential swapping opportunities among the bookshelves and computer stations, Dan left the library and headed for the park. It was a glorious summer’s day, and the lawns would be packed with sunbathers – Dan thought the potential flesh on display would inspire him. <br />
<br />
Dan wasn’t disappointed. There were plenty of topless people, including more than a few uni students. But what drew Dan’s attention the most was the sight of a group of 18 or 19 year old chavs playing football. One half had their shirts on, and the other were skins, showing off slim, lithe yet well toned bodies. <br />
<br />
Dan had always had a thing for chavs, especially the twunky variety. Unfortunately the thing that made them attractive – their toxic masculinity – was also the reason he could never act on his feelings. <br />
<br />
That could easily be changed now, though. <br />
<br />
Dan picked out the two most attractive ones – both on the skins side, with small firm pecs and nicely defined abs – then turned to look for potential donors to help him achieve his wish. He spotted two guys he knew from the LGBT Union, Carl and Steve, sitting on a bench. They were very loud, very proud and very camp gay guys and, though they were mates, Dan was aware from chatting to them both that there had been a friends with benefits element to their relationship for a while not too long ago. <br />
<br />
Dan thought about what he wanted to swap and grew a little dizzy as his eyes processed the change in the fabric of reality. When his eyes refocused, he saw that Carl and Steve’s appearance had changed ever so slightly. Carl’s hair was no longer bleached, but his natural brown. Steve’s coif had transformed into a buzz cut. Steve was no longer gesticulating wildly, and Carl seemed distracted by the tits of a girl passing by. <br />
<br />
Smirking, Dan turned to the chavs to see what was new with them. Whereas he wanted Carl and Steve to be completely oblivious to the change, he wished these two to be aware, to know that a second before, they’d liked tits and pussies, but now they wanted cock. They had both paused in their game of football, looking rather puzzled. One of them now sported bleach blond hair, while the other had a perfect coif. Their faces seemed ever so slightly different as well – were their lips a little more bee-stung than before?<br />
<br />
Whatever the change, they seemed very aware that something was different. Their friends though were oblivious. <br />
<br />
Dan was keen to test whether they truly were gay now. For that to happen, he needed to seduce them. But, with his weedy stature, pot belly and below-average looks, that wasn’t going to happen. He needed a new look and he knew just what he wanted. <br />
<br />
His English lecturer was headed through the park, clearly on his way to the university for a lecture. He was young – mid-thirties – tall, handsome and looked after himself. He had a toned, athletic build worthy of a model that filled his tight jeans and t-shirt beautifully. His striking, youthful face was leant an air of distinction and maturity by his dark curly hair which was shot through with just the right amount of silver grey. <br />
<br />
Happy he’d found exactly what he wanted, Dan switched with the lecturer, and found himself standing 20 feet away from his original position, surveying the park from a much higher vantage than he was used to. He spotted his old body turn and head towards the university – his lecturer had no idea he’d just swapped bodies. Dan looked down to admire himself briefly, savouring the tightness of his clothes against his muscles, enjoying the sight of his shelf-like pecs obscuring his view of the rest of his body. He winced at the way his junk was constricted by his tight jeans and briefs – from the way his cock snaked right across his pelvis, it was clear he was packing an impressive gun down there. He found the way it dressed to the right – he’d always dressed to the left – was strange, if not uncomfortable. It would take time to adapt to the restricted movement of his right leg instead of his left. <br />
<br />
Satisfied he’d found the right body first try, he turned to pick out his two victims and sat on a bench to wait for the right time to strike.</p>
