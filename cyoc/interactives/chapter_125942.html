<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So I wanted to ask,” Katie said as the group sat down at a table. “What did you an your parents talk about.” Kellie groaned as she covered her eyes. “My mom thinks I’m having my period,” she groaned. Katie couldn’t help but laugh.<br />
<br />
“It’s not funny,” Kellie giggled and smiled. “She gave me a tampon and some Midol. She went so far as to talk about how it’s a very special time in a woman’s life and how their emotions can get the best of them. If I wasn’t so happy to be their daughter again I would be mortified.” To <br />
<br />
Katie laughed even harder, tears slowly rolling down her cheeks. Kellie playfully slugged her friend as she too laughed. “Stop you big jerk,” she said playfully. “She was trying to be nice. It’s not her fault she probably forgot we had this conversation when I was 12.”<br />
<br />
Katie continued laughing unable to breath at Kellies funny and endearing story. “Oh. My. God. That’s funny!” She howled. “And I thought I had a good story.”<br />
<br />
Kellie turned to her girlfriend with an inquisitive smile. “Well you better share after I told you what happened to me.”<br />
<br />
Katie paused before beckoning Kellie to come closer. “Okay here it is,” she whispered. “I had to convince Samantha that she wasn’t a lesbian that wasn’t in love with my aunt.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Kellies turn to howl with laughter as Katie tried to quiet her. “Shhh,” Katie hissed. “It’s actually a very cute story. Turns out Samantha s a big fan of my aunts. What she thought was love is just hero worship. I kind of had to explain the whole how it is to be a lesbian thing to her.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that is too funny,” Kellie laughed wiping a stray tear from her eyes. “You know this ring of ours does make things interesting.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she placed her hand on Kellies shoulder. Interesting was just the tip of the iceberg as far as the Ring of Age was concerned. It had already transformed Katie and her mother Kellie into 16 year old girlfriends and given them a group of friends they were now hanging out with. Now Katie had an idea of what she wanted to do with the ring.<br />
<br />
As she was glancing around she noticed a boy of 8 looking at Samantha. The boy was not idolly just looking at the girl either but rather was giving her a look of a young boy with a crush. This gave Katie a rather ingenious idea. One that would allow them to not only use the ring again but help their friend Samantha.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kellie I have an idea,” Katie said. “You see that boy over their.” Kellie glanced over at a table where a young boy was looking at their table. “Yeah I see the kid,” Kellie said. “What about him?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled devilishly as she looked at her girlfriend. “He’s checking out Samantha. How about we help our friend out.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she understood where Katie was going with this. “Do it,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Katie now wished for the boy to age 9 years and become 17. Katie and Kellie smiled as the boy shuddered slightly. They watched as the boy slowly began to grow going from 8 to 9 then 10. The young kid wasn’t so young anymore as his face slowly matured leaving the early childhood behind as he approached his teenage years.<br />
<br />
The boy looked around slowly with a slightly confused as he becam 11 then 12. Puberty now was beginning to take hold of the boy as his arms and legs lengthened. Katie and Kellie could see the boy was beginning to develop muscles in his arms, legs and chest. Katie and Kellie could see that the boy appeared to be a bit of an athlete. His muscle development appeared slightly better than the usual 12 year old.<br />
<br />
“He’s kinda cute,” Katie said. Kellie shot Katie a bemused look. “If you say so,” she muttered. “Not really seeing it but then again not really my type. That reminds me though I don’t know how I feel about you checking guys out.”<br />
<br />
Katie giggled as she gave Kellie a tender pack on the cheek. “Don’t worry Kel,” she said. “I only have eyes for you.”<br />
<br />
The girls turned back to the boy as he became 13 then 14. While the boy was still skinny they could see his muscle development was improving as puberty kicked into gear. The boy was growing rapidly as his height began to soar. He appeared to be going through a massive growth spurt as his height shot up from a little over five feet to about 5’6”.  The boys height increase gave him a bit of a lanky look as his muscles had not quite aught with him yet.<br />
<br />
As the boy now became high school age though his muscles began to catch up with him as he continued to grow. At 15 the boy grew another inch or two as his muscles continued to grow. The boy had a lean athletic look with acute teenage face and a mop of sandy brown hair. When he became 16 the girls watched as he grew again. His face was dotted with a few blemishes but his body continued to look more muscular. Finally they watched as he finished growing becoming 17.<br />
<br />
Katie had to admit the boy was a bit of a hottie. The blemishes from 16 had faded leaving him with perfect skin and a youthful and handsome face. His body possessed a fairly good amount of defined muscle on his teenage frame. Katie was curious just how muscular this kid would become when he hit his prime but pushed the thought out of her head. Currently she could see the boy had a well defined chest with an actual six pack of abs. Even his legs possessed a decent amount of muscle with well defined calfs. Now that he was a year older than the girls he appeared slightly more confidant as he stood up and began walking towards their table. His eyes focused solely on Samantha.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he said smoothly. “Your Samantha right? Varsity volleyball and track.” Samantha turned and gaped at the teenage heartthrob in front of her. “Uh, Yea.” She stammered unable to comprehend why this attractive teenage boy was now talking with her. “Hey my names Mike. I’m on the baseball team and saw you practicing the other day. Your really good.”<br />
<br />
“Um, um, um, oh wow, um thank you,” She stammered. “I, uh appreciate that.” The girls looked on with interest as they could see this extremely handsome boy now flirting with their friend. Mike now blushed slightly as he continued to ask Samantha questions. “So I was, um, wondering,” he stammered. “If you were, um doing anything tomorrow or this weekend.” Samantha shook her head no as she continued to look dumbfounded. “Oh cool,” he breathed. “So would you like to uh, like, uh, do something? With me? Together?”<br />
<br />
“Like a date!” Samantha exclaimed. Mike nodded as he anxiously as he awaited her response. Before she could say anything though Claudia threw her hand over her mouth and answered. “It’s a date Mike,” she said quickly. “Hey tell the guys I said hi. I’ll catch up with you all later.”<br />
<br />
Mike smiled as he gave Samantha one last look before heading towards the beach. Claudia now beamed at a very stunned Samantha. “Congratulations girl,” she exclaimed. “Mike Davis,the freaking star pitcher of the team, wants to take you on a date.”<br />
<br />
Samantha just sat in stunned silence unable to comprehend what just happened. “I’m so happy for you Samantha,” Aunt Lisa said with a smile. “Have you ever been on a date befor sweety?” Samantha reluctantly shook her head no, causing Aunt Lisa to smile. “Girls I’m gonna need some help getting Sammy here ready for her date.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Mary Elise stated. “Mike Davis wants to take you out.”<br />
<br />
“Your really lucky,” Mika confessed. “Mike is an absolute sweetheart. Ashley absolute broke his heart last year when she dumped him. He hasn’t dated anyone since. He is absolutely the nicest guy and his parents are so adorable. Your going to love being with him.”<br />
<br />
As the others now focused on trying to get a bewildered Samantha ready for her date Kellie and Katie looked at each other giving each other a silent hi five. After a couple of dicey incidents it appeared they had finally done something right with the ring. Now they got to look forward to getting their friend ready for her first date.</p>
