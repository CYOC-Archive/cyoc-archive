<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jason.&quot; Matt told his brother when they were left alone. &quot;This is all my fault. I bring you here because I wanted money so desperately... I&#39;ve been a terrible big brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself.&quot; Jason replied. His voice now sounded deeper than Matt&#39;s which astounded both of them for a brief moment. &quot;I also wanted money and I chose to come with you. It&#39;s not your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
After those words, they didn&#39;t talk anymore. They felt tired because of all that happened a moment ago. The milking machine was the only sound in the room, extracting their semen constantly in a volumen that&#39;s inhumanly possible.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, two men in white lab coats arrived to inspect the guys&#39; progress and health. According to the results they&#39;re doing a good performance, the one they&#39;re expecting. Then, they proceeded to feed the guys, noticing that they were sleeping on their tables.<br />
<br />
So, in order to feed them, the men attached some kind of tubes to their mouths where a weird green goo thing started to move from the roof to their stomachs. When they felt the goo in their tongues, they suddenly woke up in panic, but they can&#39;t do anything but swallow it in order to don&#39;t suffocate.<br />
<br />
Next, the men in white lab coat whispered something to each other and then, they proceeded to open a gate from behind the tables that left Matt and Jason&#39;s butts exposed. &quot;Feel free to release your poop when you need it.&quot; One of the men said without any kind of expression on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. That kid got a pretty hairy anus.&quot; The other man said. &quot;It&#39;s fascinating how he looks more developed than his former older brother now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it would be a hard thing to do reintegrate them to the society when the milking process ends.&quot; The men talked to each other as they left the room. &quot;We alter his body but not his mind, is basically a kid in an adults body.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the men left, the room was quiet again, except for the sounds of those machines. Green goo going to Matt and Jason&#39;s mouths and white goo coming out from their abnormal dicks. They tried to talk to each other but the feeding machine didn&#39;t let them. They can only watch each other and expect they&#39;re communicating through their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Matt tried to tell but he wasn&#39;t sure that his brother understand it. He can notice some tears dripping through Jason&#39;s cheeks, at the same time that he noticed that his former little brother now had more facial hair than him. In other circumstances he would be jealous, but now that wasn&#39;t in his mind at all.<br />
<br />
Almost an hour passed and the gree goo stopped dripping through the tubes. The brothers stayed there looking at the ceiling without anything else to do. Then, the silence in the room was cut off with a sudden and very noisy fart. It was hard to tell it was from Matt or Jason, but a second and then a third one made inevitable that one of the guys was going to poop right now.<br />
<br />
Matt looked at his side and watched that Jason&#39;s was struggling to contain himself from pooping. Their current condition was so deplorable to add the shame of pooping like that. Jason was that kind of boy that even pissing in a urinal was embarrassing for him. Maybe because he had an abnormally big dick that he didn&#39;t want to be noticed by his friends who were way more smaller than him.<br />
<br />
That kind of thoughts turned him into a boy very ashamed of his body, except when he is with his big brother. Since he can remember, Matt used to go around their house shirtless or wearing just his underwear, and he didn&#39;t seem ashamed at all. A lot of guys do it anyway, Matt always said.<br />
<br />
Back to the present, Jason can&#39;t contain it anymore and after letting out a few more nasty farts, some liquid poop started to come out from his hairy anus. It seemed that he had diarrhea because all of his poop was liquid, making a huge mess under the table and even on his butt which now was also covered with poop.<br />
<br />
A man in white lab coat arrived a minute later and complained about the mess that Jason had made. He started to clean under the table, then he cleaned Jason&#39;s ass. The former kid can feel the toilet paper moving through his bigger butt cheeks and pulling some hairs from time to time. He heard before from the other lab men that he had gotten a pretty hairy ass, but is in this moment when he realized it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems the food caused that diarrhea on you.&quot; The lab man said while he looked through a computer screen. &quot;I&#39;m not authorized to change the food&#39;s composition but I can do something to prevent you from doing another mess.&quot; He left the room and then he returned five minutes later with two syringes with a yellow liquid in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is something that I developed for the Easter season.&quot; The man in white lab coat said while he injected Matt and then did the same with Jason, of course, the can&#39;t do anything about it. &quot;This will cause some side effects but at least I won&#39;t have to clean poop anymore. Hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man left after that and Matt and Jason immediately stared at each other in fear of what will happen to them now. Then, a loud fart came from Matt&#39;s butt and he knew that now was his time to poop and he would see what that last injection will do to him.</p>
