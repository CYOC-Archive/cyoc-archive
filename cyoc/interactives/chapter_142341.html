<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arran was having a miserable day. He was the son of one of the richest CEOs in the world! Yet here he is trudging through some stupid forest. He can&#39;t even get a signal on his phone! He can&#39;t call anyone for help, he can&#39;t look up a GPS, nothing! And his favorite business suit is all messed up!<br />
<br />
It all started when some of his most trusted body guards were driving him to a summer house while his father was off on a business trip. They were driving through a forest road when the limousine suddenly crashed! When he woke up, he was alone in this forest with his limousine and body guards nowhere in sight. How dare they not protect him! He&#39;s gonna fire them when he gets home!<br />
<br />
Why did he wake up nowhere near the crash site? Did he flew out the window or something? Come to thing about it, the window was left open... and he didn&#39;t have his seat belt on... But why wold he need a seat belt? It&#39;s a limousine! <br />
<br />
But seat belts were far from his concerns now. He didn&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been since he was sipping his soda in his limousine and he&#39;s already hungry and thirsty.  <br />
<br />
After a few hours of investigation, he began to feel unsettled about this forest. And it doesn&#39;t help that he NEVER walked through a forest before in his life. Such things were below him. If he had the opportunity, he would have his men explore the forest while he stayed in the limousine. Yet, here he is, and he doesn&#39;t know the first thing about survival skills! He may have seen people on TV starting fires or finding ways to know which way is east, but he never bothered to remember nor learn such things! And why would he? Hiking through some forest has nothing to do with doing business negotiations or intended public events! This forest so far hasn&#39;t been anything like the forests he seen in movies. There&#39;s no set path, meaning he had to walk through some bushes and get his clothes even more ruined! Yet... <br />
<br />
The fact that they are getting more and more ripped up by sticks and branches by the minute doesn’t seem the be the reason for this feeling of unsettlement... Ever since he woke up in this forest, he can somehow tell that it felt... more unnatural then it should be... <br />
<br />
...But despite his undesirable situation, his experience in business has taught him to be as flexible in any given situation. It may not related to business, but he must also adapt to this situation as well! He may not had any survival lessons what-so-ever, but at least he has his touch-screen phone! It has more then enough music, games and memory storage then money can buy! He can keep himself busy while he waits to be rescued...<br />
<br />
*RUSTLE*<br />
<br />
But that also mean he won’t be looking were he’ll be walking.<br />
<br />
He’ll just have to look up occasionally to make sure he doesn’t walk into a tree...<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
*RUSTLE*<br />
<br />
Arianna watched the bushes move in front of her... but nothing came out of the bushes...<br />
<br />
That makes sense.<br />
<br />
Before she was turned into a statue, she would have expected some monster to come out a eat her. But after spending what seems to be a eternity standing in this forest, she realize that some animals tend to run away from humans, and a rustling bush doesn’t always mean that whatever is inside it would come after her.<br />
<br />
Feel safe for the moment, Arianna did some stratcges as if she just woken out of bed. Feeling her body as she stratched her arms almost braught tears to her eyes! It’s been so long since she stretched!<br />
<br />
After a long moment of stretching, Arianna noted that there was another bodily urge she couldn’t ignore.<br />
<br />
Feel no shame what-so-ever, she squatted down to relieve herself.<br />
<br />
Before she was turned into a statue, she would be ashamed of relieving herself in front of anyone, even animals. But at this point, she grew to not mind if some animals watch her. She doesn’t have much a choice considering that the bandit queen took away her clothes. The residents of the forest are most likely not going to care about a naked human anyways... She hoped.<br />
<br />
But as she was relieving herself, she heard the bushes in front of her rustle again. But she remain calm. It’s probably another animal or monster passing by. They’ll probably just ignore her... maybe. <br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Arran was walking through some bushes when he looked up from his phone to check his surroundings. He was hoping to find someone to help him out of this forest... And the first thing he saw... was beyond his expectations...<br />
<br />
In front of him was a naked girl around his age.<br />
<br />
But what was REALLY beyond his expectations was that the girl was surrounded by forest filth and animals while she remained squatted down and doing what he assumes to be relieving herself. Not to mention that she had NO pants on so he had a full view of her privates excreting urine.<br />
<br />
As someone who never seen a woman naked in his life, much less seen their privates, he instinctively started running while he shouted for another human being to save him. &quot;Help! Someone! Some perverted girl is trying to rape me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! I won&#39;t hurt you!&quot; He heard a distinct old English accent. At least it sounds educated. DOesn’t sound like something from that dirty, disgusting girl.<br />
<br />
But should he bother turning around to check for the source of the voice?<br />
<br />
“...”<br />
<br />
He turned around.<br />
<br />
The naked girl was chasing after him through the bushes. He can’t help but notice the bloody scratches on her legs from running through the bushes. She seems the be the only human around, she he unfortunately had to assume that admittedly pleasant voice came from her.<br />
<br />
Arran covered his eyes and mustered a level of professionalism when addressing the forest girl. “Please, if you can understand me and have any sense of decency, PLEASE cover your self!”<br />
<br />
Even though his eyes were covered by his hands, she herd her say, “As you wish.”<br />
<br />
He heard of ruffle of leaves and sticks snapping for a moment,<br />
<br />
“Can I uncover my eyes now?”<br />
<br />
“You may open your eyes.” She answered.<br />
<br />
Arran uncovered his eyes only to see that she was holding a small branch over her privates with one hand, and holding covering her chest with her other arm. <br />
<br />
“Ugh.”<br />
<br />
Arran turned around and walked away. This girl doesn’t seem to be very useful. But if a fellow human is here, that could mean that there’s probably a house or town nearby! He’ll just ignore the shameless girl and find someone else to help him get out of this forest.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Don’t leave me behind! I want to be friends with you!” He heard her say.<br />
<br />
Arran turned around with his arms crossed over his chest. “Firstly, I’m not your friend. Any &quot;friend&quot; of mine wouldn’t through herself onto me without consent. Secondly, why SHOULD I bring a stripper like you? What use are you to me?”<br />
<br />
Arianna was getting desperate. “I can help guide you out of this forest.” She may not know how the get out of the forest to be exact... But she has seen and herd some of the victim’s getting out of the forest one way or another. Sure, some methods are not available to her, but she can try to figure something out as they go along. Anything to give this boy a reason to stay with her. She just wants someone to talk with after all this time...<br />
<br />
The boy look annoyed. “Alright girl. Lead the way.” <br />
<br />
“My name is Princess Arianna.” She corrected. She preferred to be treated with respect.<br />
<br />
The boy rolled his eyes. “Alright “Princes” Arianna. My name is Arran. Now. Tell me which ways to civilization.”<br />
<br />
The boy looked ready to leave without her. Arianna desperately tried to remember anything from her time as a statue that could help them get out of the forest...</p>
