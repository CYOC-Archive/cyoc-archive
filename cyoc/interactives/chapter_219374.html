<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis began to recount the day she returned to the ocean two years ago. She recounted that when she arrived at the gates of the Atlantean kingdom, the gatekeeper who was originally a slender mermaid man turned into a mermaid who seemed to have an oversized battle suit.<br />
<br />
She recounted that she was initially confused by what she saw, but the confusion grew as she began to enter the city. The city was now filled with naked mermaids swimming leisurely around the city.<br />
<br />
She said she didn&#39;t see a single merman or merman child. Everyone in the town was now a mermaid or merchild.<br />
She was thinking that maybe the mermen were at war with other kingdoms, but would they really bring merman children to fight as well? He didn&#39;t think too much about it at the time.<br />
<br />
Moments later she looked towards the palace, she saw that there seemed to be two mermaids giving a speech on the palace balcony.<br />
<br />
One of the mermaids had blonde hair; green eyes and also had a gold-colored tail with white spots around it. The other had ocean-like blue hair and eyes and had a red tail. Both mermaids appeared to be wearing coral crowns; shell necklaces and pearl bracelets on both arms.<br />
<br />
Alexis didn&#39;t recognize either of them, thinking that maybe her father was married to a mermaid. After all, she only knew her father from her mother&#39;s stories, so she couldn&#39;t hear anything about him other than that.<br />
<br />
The two mermaids looked young, around 20 or 30 years old. Their physical form was truly elegant from hair to tail tip, a body shape that would make any man instantly fall in love with them.<br />
<br />
The two mermaids went back into the palace, after finishing their speech. Since Alexis came late to the speech, she couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying, but judging from the fact that only a few people were present, it seemed that the matter they were talking about wasn&#39;t that important.<br />
<br />
Alexis swam to the gates of the Atlantis palace. The palace looked huge and majestic like a human royal palace. At the entrance of the palace, there were many merman statues along the way, which were the previous kings of Atlantis. When she reached the palace gate, she was immediately intercepted by a guard who didn&#39;t seem to recognize her. Alexis immediately took out the letter she was carrying in her sling bag. It was a letter written by the mermaid king on the day alexis was born. It told of alexis&#39; family and her legacy as the future queen of Atlantis.<br />
The guards who read it immediately saluted her and let her in. They told her that at this time the king was always in the throne room on the top floor of the palace.<br />
<br />
Alexis swam down the corridors of the palace. There she saw that all the servants were mermaids and mermaid children, there was not a single sign of a merman anymore. After a few minutes of swimming through the corridors, she came to the gates of the throne room which was being guarded, again by mermaids in oversized battle suits.<br />
<br />
She showed her letter once more and was allowed to enter. There, she was amazed by the contents of the throne room. Inside, there were tons of artifacts and spoils of war that they had won in ancient battles. There, he saw once again the two mermaids who had been giving speeches on the palace balcony.<br />
<br />
One of the mermaids with a golden tail seemed to be thinking hard, while the one with the red tail was busy eating grapes.<br />
Grapes.<br />
<br />
Alexis approached them and called out to them. &quot;Mmm... Hello?&quot; The two mermaids did not answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, do you hear me?&quot; she spoke louder this time, which made the two needy-looking mermaids turn their heads towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Asked the mermaid with the golden tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came here because of this letter. Here, please read it.&quot; Alexis handed the letter to the mermaids. The two mermaids read it carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... May I know who you two are...&quot; Before she finished her sentence, the golden-tailed mermaid swam over and hugged Alexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness you&#39;re home, my daughter,&quot; said the mermaid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daughter?&quot; Alexis immediately let go of the hug.&quot; Are you my new mom? I didn&#39;t know that my dad is married to two mermaids now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, the golden-tailed mermaid grinned widely. &quot;Well... It&#39;s actually not what you think, alexis. It&#39;s much more complicated than it looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it complicated?&quot; Alexis tilted her head slightly, confused by his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me explain.&quot; The red-tailed mermaid who had been silent all this time swam toward Alexis. &quot;This may sound strange dear, but after all, this is the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What truth?&quot; Alexis asked. She really didn&#39;t understand what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;This man, I mean this woman in front of you is your father. He is the king of Atlantis, King Damon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my daughter,&quot; he replied as he waved his hand blushingly.<br />
<br />
Alexis was puzzled to hear that. Was it true that this mermaid who looked like a Greek model was her father? From what she had heard from her mother, her father was a stocky merman with a shiny golden tail and blonde hair, which surprisingly fulfilled the physical requirements of her father in female form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have so many questions now,&quot; alexis said.<br />
<br />
And finally, alexis recounts that her father told her that this happened about five years ago, or about four years ago when she arrived in Atlantis. All of a sudden, all the citizens of Atlantis, both men and boys had changed gender into women and his father was one of those affected by it. The entire city of Atlantis was engulfed in a panic that made the king himself intervene to solve this problem. It turned out that the problem was not only with the city of Atlantis, but also with the other mermaid kingdoms. They all also reported that all their residents were now female. Reportedly, even those who are currently outside the city are also affected, such as patrolling soldiers, hunters, miners and even escaped prisoners.<br />
<br />
Alexis asked about the reason for this, to which the king (now queen) replied that they didn&#39;t know the reason either. They had also sent someone from the kingdom to turn humans into mermen, but the effort was useless, as they too were turned into mermaids. So far, all the scientists of the 7 kingdoms have been working together to solve this problem, but it seems that no progress has been made, other than the fact that they are still turning humans into mermaids. Mermaid scientists are currently labeling this event as the &quot;mermaid pandemic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Alexis finished her story. Laura, who was sitting next to her and listening intently, was surprised to hear the news. Of course, she had only heard stories about the ocean from her father, but he too had not been back to the ocean for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I can&#39;t turn into a merman?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, if you don&#39;t believe me just ask the mermaids in Atlantis. Many of them are men who turn into women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura got up from her seat and looked at Alexis. &quot;We must find a cure soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we are working on that. But, for now, my purpose here is to bring Chris with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I like you, Chris. Ever since I left the mainland, I&#39;ve been thinking about you every day, thinking about what your cock would feel like in my pussy.&quot; Alexis pointed to the place where Chris&#39; penis used to be, which had now been replaced by a vagina like hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura, you seemed so excited at the beginning, why are you so lethargic now?&quot; Alexis asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but that was before I knew that she would become a mermaid too. If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have been so excited,&quot; Laura replied irritably. Her tail moved back and forth in the sand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, I think she looks better now than she did then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis swam up behind Laura and moved her head towards Chris&#39; body. &quot;Look, isn&#39;t he really hot? I wouldn&#39;t even think twice about having sex with him if I were you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris immediately covered his chest. &quot;Please don&#39;t look at me like this, it&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t like it!&quot; Laura shook her head hard, not the answer Alexis wanted. &quot;Really, try looking at him one more time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Laura turned her face away from Chris&#39; body. &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll help you a little.&quot; Alexis began kissing Laura, sending thoughts of Chris to her. Laura tried to break the kiss, but it was all for naught. After a while, Alexis broke the kiss and turned her head toward Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;How, do you feel different now?&quot; Laura still closed her eyes, then looked at Chris. Suddenly, a strange feeling came over her, reverberating through every part of her body and making her pussy wet at the thought of Chris.<br />
<br />
Laura immediately shook her head to regain her senses. &quot;No, don&#39;t make me think about things that aren&#39;t true.&quot; Laura crossed her arms and swam away from them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just suggesting.&quot; Alexis helped Chris to stand up, although it was difficult at first because Chris was not used to his tail, but over time, he was able to stand up and swim properly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I can&#39;t go back to being human?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can, but it has to be based on my will, because right now you can&#39;t turn into a human without my power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded. He looked sad as he had to accept the fact that he was now a mermaid. A daugther of the ocean. Alexis smiled and kissed Chris. At that moment, the anxiety in Chris&#39; heart started to disappear and his sad face turned into a happy one.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Christine, I understand that you love your family. But right now, you need to come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christine?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, since you are now a mermaid, then of course your old name will no longer suit you, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris started to think about it. Yes, now that she was a girl, of course she should have a girl&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, then call me Christine now.&quot; She said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s wonderful. I hope you enjoy being with me Christine.&quot; The two mermaids giggled. Leaving Laura who still looked upset in the corner of the pool.</p>
