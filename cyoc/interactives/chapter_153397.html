<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie sighed, rubbing her eyes as Mika, Claudia, and a dragonness Samantha now stood awkwardly staring at Tatsu and Shizen. She hadn’t expected Samantha to be the one to fly off the rails, yet she could understand. Mothers were always protective of their children. Turning towards her own daughter she was surprised to see Katie gaping atnher friend.<br />
<br />
“I take it you didn’t know Samantha could use transformation magic huh,” she said. Katie could only shake her head, still shell shocked by what she had seen. “No that’s new,” she whispered. “Guess she’s been practicing at college.” Approaching her friend Katie felt slightly intimidated by Samantha’s appearance. Those fears though were quickly put to rest as Samantha turned, giving Katie the same goofy wave and smile she was so accustomed too.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey Katie,” Samantha said happily, her voice still animalistic but somehow friendly. “Sorry to freak you out, I um over reacted a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Overreacted,” Claudia said raising an eyebrow. “Sammy That was a bit more than overreacting. When the hell did you learn to do that?!”<br />
<br />
“Oh this,” Samantha said gesturing to her dragonness form. “Well when I got too pregnant to play volleyball I needed to do something to fill my time. Pretty cool huh.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely cool,” Kellie smirked. Samantha beamed at Kellie, which was somewhat unnerving considering the fangs she now sported. As the group now began to calm down they were surprised to see Katie’s friends Mary Elise appear inside the cabin in a puff of smoke. Narrowing her eyes she now studied the situation carefully. “So,” she said slowly. “The good news is that roar was for the most part contained in here.”<br />
<br />
“So what brought you in here than Mary,” Mika questioned. Mary Elise smirked as gestured towards the crib, a small seal glowing on the floor underneath the crib. “After the attack at Mika’s house I had a feeling it would only be a matter of time before we ran into another Kitsune,” she said. “So I placed a seal around the crib before we left on our trip, just to be on the safe side. Think of it as kind of a magical baby monitor, just in case something came looking for trouble.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie were truely impressed by the other timelines Mary Elise’s intelligence and foresight. “Your friends pretty smart their Katie,” Kellie stated. Katie could only smirk as she approached her friend. “Well happy you thought ahead Mary,” Katie said. “We were just getting acquainted.”<br />
<br />
“Actually Claudia and me were getting acquainted,” Mika giggled. “Dragon queen over here decided to go all mother of dragons up in here.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know they were nice,” Samantha groaned. “And I didn’t see you two doing anything. What were you going to do? Just let Kari be kidnapped?”<br />
<br />
Kellie groaned as Samantha, Claudia, and Mika now began to argue over who loved their child more. Watching from afar she could see her daughter and Mary Elise now trying to to calm the trio down, which was proving to be quite a feat considering Samantha size and extraordinary strength in her current form. As she was about to say something she heard the cabin door thrown open, surprised to see Mika and Kumiko rush in.<br />
<br />
“Is everything okay in here,” Mika asked as she gazed at Tatsu and Shizen. “Yes Mika Everything is Fine,” Tatsu smiled. “We were just introducing ourselves to the other timeline.” Mika nodded as she gazed at her doppelgänger and her friends. “We were worried when we heard the roar. We thought something could of happened to you.”<br />
<br />
“Wait How did you hear the roar,” Mary Elise asked. “The charm I placed around the crib should of prevented anyone that wasn’t connected to magical beings from hearing it.”<br />
<br />
Mika paused bring her lip as she looked between Mary Elise and the others. Sighing she slumped her shoulders as she turned towards Kellie and Kumiko. Kumiko smiled, placing a hand on her sisters shoulder. “Might as well tell them Mika,” she said. Mika nodded, taking a deep breath as the green flames once more engulfed her. Mika’s form shrank down into its jade fox form as a fox tail with a green flame now swayed back and forth.<br />
<br />
“Hold up She’s a Kitsune,” Claudia exclaimed to which Mika nodded. Turning towards her fiancé she now looked her over critically. “What,” the other Mika said as she raised an eyebrow. Claudia could only raise her arms in exasperation as she gazed at her soon to be wife. “Well,” she exclaimed. “Are you a Kitsune?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Mika exclaimed. “Why the hell would you think that?”<br />
<br />
“Hello,” Claudia yelled, gesturing at the jade Kitsune. “Your freaking doppelgänger is. You sure your not hiding anything?”<br />
<br />
Mika went red with anger as she glared at Claudia. “Of course I’m not hiding anything,” she yelled. “I’m just as shocked as you are.”<br />
<br />
“Your Mika is human,” Shizen said calmly. “The Mika of this timeline made the choice to join our clan of her own free will. She is now a child of our clan yet also the child of the Tozawa family. Much like your adopted daughter is yours, despite having a connection to us.”<br />
<br />
“Ok,” Mika said flatly. “I mean I’m confused as all hell but I think I follow.”<br />
<br />
Kellie had watched things transpire with her daughters friends and her Mika with interest. The groups experience with Kitsunes had not exactly been positive (as Kellie thought about it neither was hers). That one of their close friends now was one was surprising yet hopefully would change everyone’s perspective.<br />
<br />
“You doing okay Kellie?”<br />
<br />
Kellie turned towards Kumiko to find the Asian teen anxiously looking at her. “Yeah I’m fine,” she smiled. “How are you doing? Guessing this new thing with Mika kind of threw you for a loop.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah just a bit,” Kumi said. “But she’s my sister. Doesn’t matter what she is. She’s still Mika and she’s still the same girl we all know and love.” Kellie nodded as she now watched Mika talk with the other timeline and introduce them to Tatsu and Shizen. Small steps were now being taken to strengthen the bond between the timelines as well as bring more allies to their side.</p>
