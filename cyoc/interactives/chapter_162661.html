<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Jarring switch in perspective. Sorry!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I realized I had been staring at the cock  for an awkwardly long amount of time, and pulled my eyes away from it and into the eyes of a grinning Danny. Suddenly the reality of my situation hit home, as I realize this could actually happen. What worried me more than anything else was the fact a small part of me was rationalizing agreeing with the ladies, eager to join them, and it was more than just ‘Danny is too hot to say no to.’<br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to escape my dull life and live a depraved fantasy, who wouldn’t say no?<br />
<br />
“And you can undo it if I change my mind?”<br />
<br />
Danny’s face lit up again, as she edged a little closer.<br />
<br />
“Sure! Better yet, if you like it, you can keep the body, even if you wanna bail on the lifestyle.” <br />
<br />
“Only if you agree to a one week trial,” Grace blurts. You whip your head at her to see her filled with newfound determination, though still with a coy hand on her bra. “Sorry, we have been burnt before, and I really don&#39;t want to give up my gains if I am only going to have you for a day or two.”<br />
<br />
My heart jumped into my throat. That sounded agreeable, and it looked like we were moving towards an agreement.<br />
<br />
“And I will be made servile?&quot; I continued, gulping a breath. &quot;How will we know if I’m not a fan if you are warping my mind like that?”<br />
<br />
“You will still be you,” Danny continued, glaring at her companion. “Your brain will be intact, but you will be compelled to complete tasks we set for you, and doing so will give you a little rush of happy feelings.”<br />
<br />
I pushed away from the table, closing my eyes and reigning in my heart, having a good deep thought about it. It still sounded a whole lot like - and felt a whole lot like - agreeing to be brainwashed. It was hard to trust anything they say they were saying, but then again I was pretty sure the clinic could create some safe provisions, allowing me to escape if things got a bit too much. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s not like I had much to go home to, and I was pretty sure a lot of my friends would just roll with it, if not outright support it. This was also the ideal time to jump into an alternative lifestyle, coming right at the end of one project, while I still had a little financial security but little else ahead of me.<br />
<br />
Maybe taking a gap year or two was just what the doctor ordered.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” I exhaled. “If we are gonna do this I want to have a few safety features.” <br />
<br />
Danny beamed again, flipping her documents over and withdrawing a pun from her cleavage. After testing it and finding it didn&#39;t work, she tossed it to one side, taking a spare pen out of Grace’s. Grace herself looks less pleased, her eyes almost glaring at me.  <br />
<br />
“Firstly, once a week, I want one full evening to myself, with a free mind and normal body and the ability to do what I want, and one full weekend of it once a month. Second, I want the trial week to involve minimal manipulation, and to be eased in thereafter, with goal being of reaching a compromise. Thirdly, I want to have the ability to see my friends and family periodically, with minimal controls in place. Finally, I am willing to give up the ability to bail at any given moment if you allow me to have a two week vacation once a year, with the ability to break free during or a week thereafter.”<br />
<br />
Danny finished writing, and was left momentarily speechless, her eyes shooting between Danny and I. Grace, meanwhile, had shook off the last of her nerves and was sitting tall, sipping coffee as she mulled over my request. <br />
<br />
“Define one evening,” She barked softly, “and one full weekend.”<br />
<br />
“An evening starts at sundown and ends an hour before midnight, changing with the seasons, with a minimum of three hours after the sun touches the horizon and a maximum of five. If we are, for whatever reason, living at a place without sunset the evening will be fixed to the last time we experienced the evening. A weekend is defined as starting on the Friday evening and ending at dawn the following monday.”<br />
<br />
The larger lady grumbled, as Danny began to twitch in anticipation. <br />
<br />
“Okay, counteroffer.” Grace breathed. “Your weekend off happens once every eight weeks, the compromise will still incorporate a minimum standard of good manners and obedience, and your vacation will be ten days.”<br />
<br />
“That still seems too long to go without a weekend off,” I mumbed.<br />
<br />
“How about this,” Danny chirped, “we will make it six weeks, and we will give you an allowance equivalent to twenty hours of work at twenty percent more than the minimum wage.”<br />
<br />
“Make that fifteen hours,” Grace simmered, glaring at her partner. “And if you want that you are going to have to visit family with any one of us that wants to come. Moreover, unless you cancel the contract you will remain our big tiddy mom pet, right the way down to your outfits, all of which we will choose, even on holiday and while you visit your parents. However, we will give you one hundred and twenty hours to spend on your holiday at the same rate, or two hundred if you bring one or both of us, plus the same rate to spend on incorporating us.”<br />
<br />
That last part had my heart fluttering. With that kind of money I could go pretty much anywhere, if I was reasonable.<br />
<br />
“Eighteen hours and we hae a deal,” I smirked.<br />
<br />
“Done!” they said in unison, before giggling into each other into an embrace.<br />
<br />
“I will go and get this written up at the desk,” Danny declared, popping off the table. “Wait right there.”<br />
<br />
Grace continued to simmer next to me, a cheeky grin emerging on her face as we drained the last of our coffee, aware of the fact that she now had no reason to be so close, but continued to be so anyway. <br />
<br />
After a moment of silence I spoke up, clearing the nerves from my throat.<br />
<br />
“You said you got burned before, and earlier Danny mentioned that someone on your list had merged three days prior, but this is the Grand…”<br />
<br />
“This isn’t the first place to offer such services,” She interrupted, “ Just the first place to make it legal. That’s why I might seem a bit, well, on edge. If things go wrong my revenge will have to take place in the bounds of the law.”<br />
<br />
Before I could respond Danny returned bounding back, with three assistants in tow. All four of them looked very similar, very well toned, wearing nothing but the clinical underwear. The lead assistant, however, sported both a massive grin, and a rack that was hard to hide.<br />
<br />
“We have a waiver for you to sign, after that you will become our first three way transfer. Congratulations!”</p>
