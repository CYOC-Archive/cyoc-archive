<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin found himself sitting back in his car, in the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
He was back to being a large, muscular mechanic and not a male wolf fucking a female Sam. It had all felt so surreal. He could remember being whelped by a wolf bitch, growing up in a pack at the zoo, Sam being an import from another zoo. She was so beautiful, her scent had made him so hard, and they had mated instantly. A few years passed, she continued to bear his pups, and then…<br />
<br />
Dustin shook his head. He remembered the sudden explosion, the bright light, and now…he saw Sam, just outside the window. Troy hadn’t noticed Sam yet.<br />
<br />
Sam was staring around in shock, Bubba giving him a strange look, the big man standing next to him with his arms crossed over his gut.<br />
<br />
“Like I said, I’m sorry I fell asleep,” Troy was saying.<br />
<br />
Dustin ignored him, eyes on Sam. There was a look of horror in his eyes and they met his. There was an instant of recognition, as they both realized they remembered the events that had followed Sam’s assault. <br />
<br />
What did it all mean? Had they somehow, miraculously been given a second chance? Or…Dustin frowned.<br />
<br />
Had someone else been caught up in the reality shift? Someone with a Book? Someone…like, say Time?<br />
<br />
That would explain an awful lot.<br />
<br />
Bubba stepped forward and knocked on the hood of the car. Troy glanced up. Dustin saw his eyes widen in panic.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the window. Sam was there, making the Sam ‘rolling down’ motion with his hand. Troy turned to see him and was clearly freaking out.<br />
<br />
“Hey, uh, can we talk to you guys for a second?” Sam asked, not smiling. “It’s about the Book. You have one, right?”<br />
<br />
Troy numbly rolled down the window. Then he tore the Book from Dustin’s grasp and attempted to point at Sam. Things proceeded as they had before Time had been reversed. Troy still ended up becoming a raccoon, Dustin was forced to turn Bubba into another raccoon, and then they were at another standstill.<br />
<br />
“So.” Dustin said, holding his Book. “You know how things go if we continue to fight, right?”<br />
<br />
“Do you have another Book?” Sam gasped, holding a squirming Troy.<br />
<br />
“Just the Book of Beast.” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
“Then what…” Sam trailed off, looking around. “You don’t have a friend or ally with the Book of Time, do you?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Dustin said. “I’m afraid we either got very lucky or…no, I suppose we just got very lucky either way.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Sam asked, brow furled.<br />
<br />
“Either we caught the Book of Time in the reality shift and he had to undo it….or he happened to reverse time at the exact moment we needed it most. During a far-off battle or something.” Dustin explained.<br />
<br />
“Any other explanations?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m not sure what happens to a Book if the owners get reality shifted into something that doesn’t read. Maybe it disappears forever, goes to another owner or something. I haven’t gotten the full rules for the Books yet.”<br />
<br />
“Me neither. So you’re saying he might have reversed time to make sure he could take us out and get our Books?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly.”<br />
<br />
“You said he could have used Time reversal or something during a battle. Isn’t…I can’t imagine he’s in the same town, right? So how could it reach this far?”<br />
<br />
“Time is strong. Maybe the more Books you get, the farther your powers can reach.”<br />
<br />
Sam shuddered. “Alright. Let’s call a truce.”<br />
<br />
“I’m listening.” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
“You turn back Bubba and Buck.” Sam said. “And we chop your cars. Until we find out who Time is, or where they are, we work together. I ain’t interested in being aged into dust or frozen forever. You know the spell list, right?”<br />
<br />
“Of course. Troy told me. It’s incredibly dangerous. He can rewrite your personality.” Dustin shuddered.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Sam nodded. “Deal?”<br />
<br />
“Deal.” Dustin said, then pointed at Troy. “Shape.”<br />
<br />
As Troy resumed his human form, Dustin turned to Bubba, feeling the last of his strength ebb away. He’d forgotten how tired the spellcasting was in his excitement. He pointed at him.<br />
<br />
“Shape.” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
As Bubba resumed his human form, Dustin passed the Book to the now-human Troy, who scratched his beard and looked at Sam. “Why’d you undo it?”<br />
<br />
“Talk, please…truce…” was all Dustin could get out before he passed out.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Troy was embarrassed at first, the more Sam talked. He’d realized what had happened, his memories returning the more Sam spoke. He got out of the car and just began conversing with Bubba and Sam. They were nice enough guys, and were just as worried about time.<br />
<br />
“Man, another Book user? This close?” Troy shook his head. “I’d have a hard time believing it, but I remember it all as you described it. Shit, how do we stop that?”<br />
<br />
“Gotta come up with a plan.” Bubba said. “Maybe Time saw us fighting from the road?”<br />
<br />
“What, they were driving by and happened across a Book battle?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. As long as we keep our profile low, they’d pass right through town without noticing us.” Sam said.<br />
<br />
Troy glanced behind him. Dustin was still asleep in the car. It had been a few hours and now they were just shooting the shit, waiting for Dustin to wake up.<br />
<br />
“So how do you guys divide the Book?’ Troy asked, curious.<br />
<br />
“Like?” Sam glanced at Bubba.<br />
<br />
“Like, who gets to use the Book and when?” Troy asked. “I’m good at fighting…usually. But Dustin&#39;s the brains.”<br />
<br />
“We kinda just share.” Bubba shrugged. “Usually I handle to bad customers and Sam handles the good ones.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Troy rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you asked.” Bubba rolled his massive shoulders in a shrug.<br />
<br />
While they were talking, Sam reached behind him, scratching his back. That was when Dustin stirred in the seat. Troy smiled.<br />
<br />
“Ey, look who’s up!” Troy waved for Dustin to join them.<br />
<br />
Dustin heaved himself out of the car, staggering groggily over to the other men. He glanced between them. <br />
<br />
“Everyone still alive?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Sam and Bubba said at once.<br />
<br />
“Alright Buck, fill me in on the deets.” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
Troy walked over. Behind him, Sam and Bubba were talking quietly to each other. Troy filled in the gaps for Dustin-or Alpha, as he called himself without the protection of the Book. Dustin nodded along, glancing over at Sam and Bubba, who were whispering sharply to each other.<br />
<br />
“Everything okay over there?” Dustin called.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s cool, Alpha.” Sam looked up, grinning. “We’re trying to figure out how to make things run smoother.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t trust them.” Alpha whispered. “Don’t like how excited they’re gettin’.”<br />
<br />
“Take the Book then,” Troy said handing over the Book.<br />
<br />
As he did, Troy was immediately hit with a strange sensation. He felt faint, limp, as if he would fall over at any moment. He pushed the Book into Dustin’s hand, latching onto his wrist to steady himself. When his hand touched Dustin’s, the feeling vanished.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I just felt real sick there for second.”<br />
<br />
Troy then tried to release Dustin’s wrist. He couldn’t. He felt his hand clasp tight to Dustin’s skin. Troy tried to release his grip but couldn’t. It was like his own body was fighting against him, or the muscles and nerves were all wrong.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, I can’t let go. What’s happening?” Troy said, voice rising in panic.<br />
<br />
He tried to shake Dustin away, but he just ended up moving Dustin’s whole body with him as he tried to pull away. The connection was firm, and Troy could feel it deepen by the second. Dustin’s face was pale, eyes wide with shock.<br />
<br />
“What the are you doing? Let go of me!” Dustin tried tugging, but only pulled Troy towards him.<br />
<br />
Troy looked closer at his hand to see what was wrong. He saw his fingers sunk deep into Dustin’s skin. Where Troy was connected, Dustin’s wrist bulged out, pushing as if there was something underneath. Troy’s fingers were invisible; they were inside Dustin. <br />
<br />
Before Troy could even react to this revelation, he saw his hand sink deeper in. Dustin’s hand bulged, the hand looking like both Troy’s and Dustin’s for a moment…then shifted. The color of the hair became a dirty brown and the hand itself thickened with meat and fat. They were merged together.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” Troy yelled. “Do something Dustin. We’re merging together!”<br />
<br />
They both began to try and pull away, straining themselves as their attempts proved completely futile. With each attempt they seemed to only hasten the progress of the merging. Soon Troy’s arm was stuck halfway to his elbow, the merging arm below it thick and hairy and muscular. With a flex of the muscles, Troy felt himself sink in another inch. It was clear that the process was stimulated by their rapid movement.<br />
<br />
Sam laughed. “No point in struggling now! This is for the best.”<br />
<br />
Dustin immediately figured it out. “You did this! You could merge with the book, so you can merge bodies as well! We had a deal! What about our truce?”<br />
<br />
“This is our truce. It’s better work with one of ya than two. Plus you love birds will love being closer together. Bubba and I liked it well enough.” Sam looked at Bubba and winked.<br />
<br />
Troy was disgusted. If he didn’t act fast, he and Dustin might be merged permanently. With his free hand he placed it on Dustin’s shoulder and tired to pull himself away. In doing so, his hand attached to Dustin’s shoulder, merged just like his other hand. He’d made this situation infinitely worse!<br />
<br />
“Dammit, Troy!” Dustin cried out in anger.<br />
<br />
“FUCK, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean that. I can’t let go now,” Troy pleaded.<br />
<br />
“You idiot! This is all your fault! Why couldn’t you just think for a moment! You got us fucked in that other timeline and you’re doing it again now,” Dustin screamed.<br />
<br />
Troy eyes welled up with tears of shame and anger. His left arm was now completely attached to Dustin’s right arm. It was thick and meaty, bigger than both of their arms had been, covered in a forest of dirty brown hair. Troy struggled to make space between the two of them as he was hovering extremely close to Dustin’s face. If they touched there it would be game over. Troy looked around for any salvation. He spotted his Book still in Dustin’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Dustin, give me the book. I’ll cast a spell on them!” Troy said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“With what fingers?” Dustin asked pointedly as Troy’s arm continued to sink into his other shoulder.<br />
<br />
It was so strange, Troy could feel his limbs in the new arms, the bones and muscles squelching and creaking together-and yet he couldn’t actually move the arm. It was like a new bundle of nerve clusters were there, yet they weren’t his. He realized, with an overwhelming sense of dread, that by attempting to pry Dustin off of him, he’d doomed them both. Dustin didn’t have any energy left.<br />
<br />
“Wait, can you-?”<br />
<br />
“It’s useless.” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
He could see that Dustin had also come to the same conclusion as he had. There was no spell that could undo the merge. The best they could hope for was that they kept hold of the Book through the merge and stayed themselves on the other side.<br />
<br />
Troy felt himself get tugged closer, his furry beer belly bumping gently against Dustin’s smaller one. They stuck together. Troy looked down and saw their clothes were merging as well, leather jacket and wifebeater swirling together. His stomach churned as they were drawn ever closer, and he and Dustin belched at the same time.<br />
<br />
He leaned back, trying to keep himself away from Dustin. Their groins touched, and Troy gasped as he felt a slithering sensation in his cock. It felt like it was growing big and wide and then their balls touched and he moaned in pleasure and mild nausea as they swelled. Whoever he-they-were becoming was clearly well-hung.<br />
<br />
As his ass was absorbed along with his hips, he had the curious sensation of his back losing its rigidity. His lower back swelled out behind him, buttons appearing on his wifebeater, straining to contain furry fat and flab. His spine dissolved at the same time the heavy gut flopped over the new belt behind him. Troy fell forwards onto Dustin’s chest, their mouths meeting in a shocked kiss.<br />
<br />
They mumbled into each other’s mouths, gasping as their lips flowed into each other. Troy attempted to pull away, stretching their skin, and was tugged back, the side of his face smacking into Dustin’s with a meaty THWOP. Again, Troy attempted to move away, feeling his teeth and Dustin’s jumble together.  The pulling grew intense, and Troy realized everything about them had merged and mixed except their heads, the force growing stronger. <br />
<br />
He gurgled in horror as Dustin’s eye met his, the orbs binding together, vision growing slit. Then their foreheads met and their heads squished together. Their brains oozed into contact and the world exploded into sensory overload. It was turmoil, the back of Troy’s head twisting and adjusting, hair shifting down, forming an enormous beard that trailed down to his new gut. Eyes opened, nose grew into existence. Everything about them changed into a different person.<br />
<br />
Dustin’s thoughts collided with his. When they looked down at themselves-an act that was involuntary on their part, to Troy’s horror-they saw a heavily muscled, big-bellied body below them, wearing a clean starched shirt and a handsome leather jacket. A stetson appeared on their head. <br />
<br />
Troy could feel something else in his mind as well. Was someone else besides Dustin in here? As he tried search his head he could feel the presence of powerful man, more powerful than Dustin or Troy. As their new body moved, it wasn’t Troy or Dustin who did the moving. The man reached up with thick, hairy mitts and pulled off his hat, rubbing his bald head. Another meaty hand dug into his breast-pocket, pushing aside his big, well-kept beard, and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.<br />
<br />
Troy blinked as he watched his body light it up and smoke it happily. A soothing calmness pervaded his mind. He wanted to speak out, take back control, but found it too difficult to try. Dustin was still there, arguing, but he could hear his voice slowly quiet as the nicotine soothed his nerves. Troy’s thoughts flew apart. He felt himself slip away, assimilating into deep voice of the man.<br />
<br />
“Man, I feel so weird today?” Dusty’s voice rumbled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Bubba asked, sizing him up. “I think you look great.”<br />
<br />
Dusty smiled, the voices in his mind smoothing out, quieting, becoming one line of thought. He could feel their memories, thanks to the Book. Apparently, he had once been two boys named Troy and Dustin, though the idea felt silly to him. Their lives were…kinda sad. He was disgusted seeing their lives, lounging around idle and useless. That all changed when they found the Book. Dusty thought about what he would do if he had that Book. He would turn people into animals for fun, play with people until he got bored. The thought excited him.<br />
<br />
Now, memories of selling off helpless people welled up into his mind. He adjusted his crotch, growing hard at the thought of turning someone into property and selling them. Fuck! He wished he’d thought of that. Well, he had hadn’t he? He would have to continue that business, maybe branch out into more fun prospects. Dusty smirked at all the new possibilities before him. Bubba mistook his smirk and adjustment as a come on. <br />
<br />
The big bear embraced him, going in for a smoky kiss, his meaty hand fingering Dusty’s turgid cock through his jeans.<br />
<br />
“You’re so hot, Dusty.” Bubba moaned. “I’m glad you got the Book.”<br />
<br />
Dusty’s mind filled with memories of practically hanging out like family with Bubba and Sam. He loved Bubba and Sam, he thought of them with upmost respect. He loved fucking their large bodies, hearing them cry out in pleasure. When they got married…he was honestly a bit jealous they hadn’t married him. Although at first he felt envy and some resentment towards Bubba and Sam, because they included him still in their sex, Dusty didn’t mind it… much. But now they all worked together at their Body shop, turnin’ fellas into hot bears, some on two legs, some on four. It was certainly a great life.<br />
<br />
When someone came in that was unruly, well, old Dusty would be around to turn them into something fun. He had plenty of chains to keep people secured while they changed. He had his on space in the back where he could do whatever he wanted. Bubba and Sam gave him plenty of privacy when he had work to do. He was itching to get back to it.<br />
<br />
He adjusted himself, hand grabbing his cock through his leather. His mind had all but settled. So much for Dustin and Troy. He smiled. It pleased him to think about those two boys trapped in his mind<br />
<br />
“Y’all ready for that orgy?” Dusty asked.<br />
<br />
Sam frowned, eyeing him close.<br />
<br />
Had to be careful around that one. Seemed like Sam didn’t trust Dusty to be obedient. Sam was right to fear him, but Dusty knew too well how to appease him. He too liked dumb, easily misled himbos. Dusty gave the dumbest look he knew how towards Sam.<br />
<br />
“Well…I suppose it is.” Sam said slowly, a smile crossing his face. “Glad you could make it, Dusty.”<br />
<br />
Sucker.<br />
<br />
Dusty beamed in appreciation and walked up to the shop with a strut, Bubba’s arm around his waist. Behind him, Dustin’s old car transformed into Dusty’s new truck as reality fully settled. Dusty was fine with that. He wasn’t planning on becoming Troy and Dustin again, if he could help it.</p>
