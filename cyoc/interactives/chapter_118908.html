<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Beast was prowling the forest. Still raping and eating and doing monster things. It even ate a police car complete with the people inside it. However, the more it prows, the less monster type things it does. It started with killing and raping its prey, to just mauling them, to out right ignoring the prey. Its not because its full. It&#39;s always starving. It&#39;s a mindless beast after all. But what is this wetness around its eyes?<br />
<br />
Soon, it came upon two humans. A teenage boy and a teenage girl. It appears the human girl is pulling the human boy&#39;s pants off. But why would the beast knows that the girl is pantsing the boy? It should only know monster things.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when a strange voice sounded in it&#39;s head. &quot;This girl is humiliating the boy for no reason. I have the power to transform one of them into a monster like you. Which one should it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why should the monster care? If anything, it will get mate if it answers &#39;yes&#39;.  But before it gave its answer, it realized it can&#39;t talk. It can&#39;t say yes or no. But wait. Why can it understand this strange language anyways? It&#39;s a mindless beast. Nothing more...so why is it crying? Why is it missing  its parents so much. Why is it/she NOT mindless...<br />
<br />
In an instant, Jen&#39;s identity as a human snapped back into place. <br />
<br />
  No. Losing your humanity, life and memories is a bad thing. No one should have their identity taken from them. If anyone should be a monster, it should be herself. She was given amazing things no one else had, she had a fancy house, fancy cloths, a house maid and she used her semi wealthy life to hurt others who don&#39;t have fancy things. <br />
<br />
If anyone deserves to lose their humanity, it&#39;s her and her alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who should it be?&quot; The voice repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me.&quot; Jen said quietly. <br />
<br />
In a dream space like this, even memories blocked away by the curse can be remembered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle is the reason why you are in the state you are now. Don&#39;t you want to give him the same curse to get even with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was quiet. That is until she realize the dream changed and she is now in her original human form, with tears trailing down her face. &quot;Kyle had the right to curse me. All my life, I have been abusing the privileges given to me. I don&#39;t know what he was going through before I helped prank him but if  he felt the need to make someone pay, then I probably deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice sighed. &quot;Very well&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thing Jen knew, her remaining human parts became random animal parts. The transformation was long, very painful, and she was screaming in pain during the whole process. When it was time for Jen&#39;s human brain to transform, she painfully blacked out. What was left was not Jen, but a complete animal with no trace of human left.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was in a black void witnessing memories of a life as a animal. But it might as well be like looking through the eyes of someone else.  The things animal Jen did were horrible. First, animal Jen killed Samual in his sleep. The it started rampaging through town, killing Kyle, Juile and her fellow cheerleaders, then Jen&#39;s own parents... <br />
<br />
Things got worse from there. She began going around town killing and raping anything and anyone, infecting people with her pollen and turning them into chimera monsters like herself.<br />
<br />
Eventually she was captured by the government and experimented on until she died.<br />
<br />
In the black void, Human Jen was screaming. This is not what she wanted. She only want herself to suffer. Not everyone else. Suddenly, she was in the dream forest again. But instead of dream Jen and dream Kyle standing in front of her, a smiling girl in a white robe was standing in their place. Even though Jen can only see her mouth, she can tell she was gorgeous. Maybe even more beautiful then herself. She can also tell that the girl was about the same age as Jen. That&#39;s when she spoke...<br />
<br />
&quot;You passed the test.&quot; The white robed girl congratulated.<br />
<br />
Jen was confused. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl took a deep breath. &quot;I was once a girl like you. That was until I was cursed to be a curse. An idea. An figment. A rumor. You may know me as the town curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
As weird as this dream was, Jen quickly made the connection that this girl is somehow the spirit of the Transform of Dare curse.<br />
<br />
Just to be sure she ask the dream girl if she really is what she suspected her to be. The girl simply nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. For the many years, I have only been only a thought. A curse.  I am only allowed to speak to those on the borderline between their original selves and the being they are cursed to be. I speak to people through their dreams because the dream world shows their truest form of spirit and soul. In my many years of lost humanity, victims of the town curse usually summit to their sexual desires and ask to stay as they are permanently. I then lock them in their form. On rare occasions, people would chose to go back to their human forms. I therefore take the curse away from them. This is the test of humanity and I only give it to those I chosen specifically. Those who show signs of changing for the better or for the worse. Victims and users of the curse alike are only as human as they want to be. YOU however, are one of the very few who took the middle route.  You have your flaws and in no way completely innocent. You choose to keep the curse in order to prevent others from enduring your pain. However, you also choose to give up your humanity, which would done the exact opposite from what you desire. That choice shows that you are naive and arrogant, but it also shows your kindness.&quot;<br />
<br />
The white hooded girl hugged Jen. Jen, who is still processing this information, chose not resist the embrace. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault that you were born in a better position in life then others. And even tough you abused what was given to you, you sincerely wish to correct that mistake now, which is something not everyone is willing to do&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope bloomed in Jen&#39;s heart. &quot;Does this mean you will turn me back into a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pale girl gave out a chuckle. &quot;No. I did say you took the middle road didn&#39;t I. When I asked you if you want your humanity back, you declined.&quot; Jen began sobbing even more.&quot;However... unlike some people I met.... I can tell you don&#39;t want to summit to your desire and truly become a beast. You just want to make up for the people you harmed over the years. I can respect that at least... but before I explain the consequences of your decision, I think its time for me to introduce myself.&quot; Jen wiped away her tears.<br />
<br />
The girl released her embrace. &quot;My name is Echo the Mage, and when you wake up, you will be a mix between your human self and your chimera self. A anthro furry basically. This is possible because of your partial control over your form. Before we continue, I should say your control was not intended when Kyle stated the terms of your curse.  Lying randomly changes your body as stated, and you forgot that Kyle cursed you, but that is all that really came true. For some reason beyond my understanding, Kyle&#39;s curse was really weak (and not very well worded) compared to the other curses people used me to create. Your &#39;friends&#39; from the cheerleader squad still remember you as a complete human. (Echo knows that not all the cheerleaders consider Jen as a &#39;friend&#39; even though Jen herself hasn&#39;t realized that yet) This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen with the town curse,  &quot;I&quot; was suppose to automatically rewrite reality so they treat your current form like you were born like that. But for some reason, they remember you from before you were cursed. And to top things off, you were supposed to get animal parts. Not inanimate parts like your vacuum cock. I can&#39;t tell what kind of changes you might get at this point. You might get a ass for a hand if you don&#39;t stop lying.Your body parts might even be interchangeable at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blushed at the mention of his/her cock from earlier. Her inactive vacuum cock grew into existence on her human dream body. She/he began stroking  her cock. Jen grunted as she felt more animal parts growing on her dream body. <br />
<br />
Echo looked in concern. &quot;Stop stroking your cock. The more you summit to your sexual desires, the less chances there is of ever being human in real life again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen quickly dismissed any lustful animal thoughts as her animal parts disappeared from her dream body. As her human body returned, Jen asked questions that has been bothering her for awhile. &quot;Why are you so friendly to me? Why are you telling me any of this. Why are you helping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo simply smiled. &quot;I been watching you since you&#39;ve been cursed. That includes reading your thoughts. I have hopes that you will be one of the few that can break the curse&#39;s hold on you. &#39;My&#39; hold on you is already  very weak so it is a miracle that I am even able to talk to you so clearly in your dream.&quot; Echo  paused for a moment... &quot;Also... It&#39;s been a long time since I had a proper conversation with anyone. The curse usually just forces me to test an chosen individual then disappear from their dream. I&#39;m only allowed to talk to others just to test them. The only reason I can talk to you after the test is probably because of your weak connection to the curse...&quot;<br />
<br />
The forested area around the duo faded to black. &quot;Your dream is going to be  ending soon. Let me say as much as I can before it ends. We can talk later when you sleep again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded in understanding.<br />
<br />
Echo continued.&quot;I don&#39;t fully understand why your curse is so unstable, but I think it has something to do with your emotional state. When you believed you were a monster, you had no control over your curse, thus your body began changing randomly and looking more and more beastly as you kept lying. However, when you wanted your vacuum cock to be quiet, it silenced itself for you. In addition, your ears became more flower like to appease to your desire to have a worse, more desirable sense of hearing. Even more so, when you decided to view your self as a chimera, you grew more relaxed, hence your more anthro-like appearance when you wake up. Further more so, when you started to view yourself as a guy, your body took a more masculine appearance. Enough to make you look and feel like an actual guy. Even more so, your mental state is very close to when you were 5 years old. Hence the age change. What I&#39;m trying to say, is that your emotional state and how you view yourself help dictates what your body&#39;s appearance would be to match your spirit and soul. If you view yourself as a monstrous beast, you lose your humanity more and more. When you view certain aspects of yourself as human, the more human like they will become. For example, if you view your bat wings as human hands, the more hand like they will become. But if you continue to view yourself as a chimera, the longer you stay as a cross between human and animal. Your emotional and mental state also partially controls the reality around you. Your cheerleader friends still remember you as a human cheerleader because of your desire for a life as a cheerleader. However, I&#39;m going to let you decide what life you take. This situation is getting exiting. Even for me. Basically; You Choose Your Own Change (TM).&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though a lot of things makes sense to Jen now, she still had questions. Like this for example. &quot;Why you speak so formally. You&#39;re using words like &quot;therefore&quot;, &quot;However&quot; and &quot;In addition&quot; and maybe even &quot;thus&quot;. Did you rehearsed or written down this speech or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The white robed girl who looks like she belongs to Assassins Creed(TM) laughed wholeheartedly. &quot;When you have as much alone time as I have, you began to think about what you say first. I probably over did it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo&#39;s body began fade to black with the rest of the dreamscape.  Jen stood in total darkness as she continues to hear Echo&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m running out of time. Even though you can talk to me freely when you&#39;re asleep,  eventually our bond will grow stronger and you will be able to talk to and see me telepathically when you are awake. However, you will forget that phone call conversation with Kyle again when you wake up. Apologies for telling you all of this in one dream session, but there is only so much I can tell you at one time. I&#39;m not even sure I CAN talk to you in your next dream.&quot; <br />
<br />
Echo&#39;s voice was getting harder to hear as Jen started hearing shouting from the real world. &quot;You will wake up soon. Talk to you later friend, sweet day dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
The darkness faded away as Jen opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jen woke up.<br />
