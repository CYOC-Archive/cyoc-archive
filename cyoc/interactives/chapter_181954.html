<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fred sighed in annoyance the second he entered his dorm room again. He was a first year student which meant he had to share a tiny space with another guy. He had the unfortunate reality of being stuck with Kase, a guy who was he was supposed to have a lot in common with.<br />
<br />
Sure they both liked basketball, but that was where the similarities ended. Kase cheered for a different team, Kase liked completely different beer, and worst of all Kase was an absolute slob.<br />
<br />
Their room was divided in half, and Fred’s side was extraordinarily clean. Everything was organized, he had all his surfaces dusted, and his garbage can was nice and empty. Unfortunately Kase’s side of the room was dominated by piles of dirty laundry, mountains of empty takeout containers, and a messy disorganized desk. His bed wafted this putrid stench from it and his basketball posters were hung crooked and improperly, bound to tear things off the walls.<br />
<br />
“That god damned liar!” Fred exclaimed while thrusting his arms to his sides. Kase had promised to clean up his side of the room and now it was too late, he only had about fifteen minutes before Penelope showed up to study.<br />
<br />
She was this attractive girl in his history class with beautiful black hair and these gorgeous brown eyes that made his heart melt. He’d invited her into his space to study but Kase’s side of the room was so gross that...<br />
<br />
“Knock knock,” her voice piped up behind him and she stepped into the room with her books all collected and a smile on her face. She then gazed across the room and her face fell into a look of disgust. “Oh...”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my roommate was supposed to clean that up, that layabout,” Fred laughed nervously. The reek from Kase’s bedsheets hit Penelope’s nose and she looked like she was about to throw up.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I... urk... just remembered I had other plans,” Penelope gagged before backing away and running off. Fred gave a cry trying to get her to come back but she was already dashing down the hall. He lowered his arm, turned to his roommate’s filth in rage and let out a shout.<br />
<br />
“That’s it!” He screamed before picking up the nearest pile of filthy and crusting clothing and hauling it to the laundry room. He stuffed everything into the washer in rage before starting it up and storming back to his room.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t take it anymore, Kase had just ruined a study session with a great girl, she’d wanted to be alone with him until she caught sight of his disgusting filth. He stripped his roommate’s bed, used a full cam of freshener on it, filled garbage bags with empty takeout containers, and swept and mopped the floor on his side of the room.<br />
<br />
But by bit Kase’s side of the room started to look better, and it only got nicer when another pile of disgusting clothes was lugged to the laundry room. The space tidied up, he pushed the bed aside, cleaned the windows, and organized Kase’s bathroom drawers. Then the laundry dinged and Fred dumped a pile of clothes on the bed and started to fold them. He was so angry he didn’t even notice that all Kase’s clothing was now sized and shaped for a girl, or that he was folding bras and panties alongside the shirts, sweaters, and pants.<br />
<br />
Laundry dinged over and over and Fred folded and put away feminine clothing article after feminine clothing article in Kase’s drawers and closet. The clean scent of lavender got in his nose and made his entire body relax, he liked the smell of fresh laundry and even better was the feel of warm clothing on your skin. He loved lugging those piles of clothes from the laundry room and folding them, they all felt so cozy. Even better was the blanket. When it came out of the dryer Fred wrapped himself up in it and smiled pleasantly. When he did laundry he always changed into hog clothes with his last load, too bad the final load from Kase’s floor wasn’t his.<br />
<br />
The room was all neat and tidy, Kase had straightened out and cleaned everything, the only thing left to do was get that final load of clothing folded and put away. But he loved the smell of freshly cleaned clothes and they felt so nice on his skin. He’d done all that work, didn’t he deserve to wear some of it.<br />
<br />
He picked up a blue bra and stared at it, girls clothes weren’t something he’d worn but that bra smelled so clean and it was so warm in his fingers. It would feel even better on his chest. He stripped down quickly, drawing the bra onto his barren chest and doing up the latch on the back. It felt good on his skin, fresh from the dryer and smelling so clean.<br />
<br />
He picked up a pair of panties after that, striped blue and purple and slid it up his legs, encasing his crotch in a warm pair of underwear that just felt clean and soft against his junk. It wasn’t sized to him at all but he felt so good in that underwear even if it was restricting his junk.<br />
<br />
He grabbed one of the shirts next, a long sleeved one with a V-neck. It was one of those shirts that was crafted to look like two. A short sleeved blue top with long grey sleeves running down to his wrists. It was tight but it was just as warm and clean as the bra and panties.<br />
<br />
He pulled on long socks that matched the panties, striped with grey and purple that were so tight but so comfortably warm on his legs. He then struggled to fit a tight pair of skinny jeans on, they were so tight and warm but so small he couldn’t get them up all the way, he strained and strained and for some reason it suddenly became easier. He grinned as he pulled them onto his waist and did up the button and zipper, finding himself comfortable and warm in a fresh set of clothing, sure it was girls clothes but it felt so nice on his skin. In fact it was feeling even better by the second.<br />
<br />
Fred gave a moan as his hips and ass shifted in proportion until he was filling out the skinny jeans nicely. He needed more room though and thankfully his crotch made space when his junk slurped back into his body.<br />
<br />
Her legs then sized down to fit the jeans and those socks became a lot more comfortable and loose, her feet the perfect size for their shape, small and womanly. Her shoulders shrunk inwards and that shirt began to fit better around her waist and shoulders but it was so loose on her chest and her bra was so empty. Thankfully the heat intensified and her chest began to balloon outwards, more flesh and skin surface area to be hugged by that freshly washed bra. It was a wonderful sensation and Fred groaned in pleasure, loving how all her clothes suddenly fit.<br />
<br />
Her hands shrunk, her body hair retracted and stopped being caught up in the fabric of her socks, and her face began to alter and change, chin shrinking, nose becoming petite, and eyes gaining longer lashes. Her hair began to flow down her back, feminine and long and it took on a well cared for sheen of health, knitting itself back into a ponytail from all the cleaning Fred had just been doing.<br />
<br />
“Nothing beats clothes fresh from the drier,” she sighed, the name Fred altering in her head to become Frieda. She get so warm and cozy at that moment, the sensation was just heavenly. Sure it was her roommate’s clothing but all of it fit her so nicely, plus she’d wound up doing all his laundry so it was only fair she got to wear some of it. She would return it eventually.<br />
<br />
“Too bad I couldn’t study with Penelope, but you know what, I’m so comfy right now I’m kind of glad you left your side of the room such a mess,” she sighed while laying back on her bed, enjoying the comfort of her warm lavender scented clothes and dreading when the heat finally wore off and that comfort vanished.</p>
