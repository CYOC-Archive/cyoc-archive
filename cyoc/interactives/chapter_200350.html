<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had no interest in staying as his own mother forever, and he knew the smart move was turning himself back to normal.  After all, his parents had just come back from their vacation, and Jeff had only a couple of moments to fix everything.  But he couldn&#39;t resist.  What would it be like to be his older sister Emily?<br />
Jeff quickly refreshed the screen on his computer monitor, which had automatically started up the Chronivac app when Jeff plugged in the device.  Jeff himself was the last person transformed, so he was still the current selection.  Jeff updated all the relevant fields:<br />
SUBJECT: Jeff Smith<br />
TRANSFORM INTO: Emily Smith<br />
START TIME: Immediate<br />
DURATION: Permanent<br />
Jeff paused for a second, thinking about whether there was anything else he wanted to do.  He decided not to make any more changes at this time: he could always fix any mistakes later, and his parents were about to come into the house.  He hit ENTER and unplugged the Chronivac right away, rushing from Jeff&#39;s bedroom to Emily&#39;s bedroom in a rush to put on a bathrobe before his parents came home.<br />
As a result, Jeff barely paid attention as he transformed from his mother&#39;s body into his sister Emily&#39;s body.  He felt himself becoming shorter, and his body felt like it was compressing, which Jeff knew because Emily was somewhat skinnier than his mom.  He noticed the panties he was wearing, which of course he had taken from his mom, felt a bit looser on Emily, but not so much that he had to change anything while he had bigger problems to worry about.  He also felt his hair falling further down the back of his neck, and in the corner of his peripheral vision he saw the hair color change from his mom&#39;s dyed blonde to his sister&#39;s natural red.  In any event, he rushed to his sister&#39;s closet, rifled through until he found a bathrobe, and threw it on.  <br />
Jeff then went to the top of the staircase and acted surprised to see his mom and dad.  &quot;Oh hi!&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Emily!  How are you?&quot; his dad asked.  &quot;How was Europe?&quot;<br />
Oh, right, Jeff remembered.  Emily had gone for a two-week trip to Italy, France, and the UK with her Western Civilization class.  &quot;Uh, tres bien, merci,&quot; he said.  &quot;I actually just got back 20 minutes ago.  Mind if I take a shower?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Jeff&#39;s mom, in a body that Jeff now knew well.  &quot;We can wait to hear about how it went.&quot;<br />
Jeff went into the bathroom and shut the door, relieved to have gotten through that incident.  He took off Emily&#39;s bathrobe and his mom&#39;s panties and looked at his new body in the mirror.  Emily was on the soccer team and swim team, so she had a toned physique.  Jeff wasn&#39;t involved in Emily&#39;s social circle, partly because she was a senior and he was a freshman and partly because he didn&#39;t want to hang out with her, but he knew she was one of the popular girls and had plenty of guys interested in her.  Emily also had smaller breasts than Jeff&#39;s mom.  Jeff didn&#39;t necessarily mind, as he knew Emily was still growing, and he thought it might be easier having less weight and bulk there for a while.  Still, he made a mental note to consider changing that with the Chronivac at some point.<br />
He started up the shower and climbed in.  He spent a while in there, running his hands along his new body.  He hadn&#39;t really thought through what he was going to do, but he thought it might be fun to be his older sister for a while.  She was a senior and the oldest in the family, so their family gave her a lot more freedom than Jeff had.  Plus, she was popular and pretty, so Jeff figured school would be more fun.  And speaking of school, she was about to graduate.  Jeff started thinking about what it would be like to go off to college as Emily.  His mind started wandering to all the adventures he could have as he stepped out of the shower and started toweling off.<br />
Jeff wrapped the towel around his body, impressed and amused to see how his sister&#39;s breasts held up the towel and covered up all the relevant areas.  As he reached down to open the door, he froze: what about the original Emily?  She was still coming home from the class trip today.</p>
