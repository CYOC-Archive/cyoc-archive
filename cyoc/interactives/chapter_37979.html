<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron was walking home from school when he passed through the small, deserted street where there was an odd foggy mist. It had rained that morning, so it wasn’t unusual for the area to be surrounded by a thick fog, so Aaron didn’t think anything of it. He was late leaving school because he had just had a huge fight with Kristi, his girlfriend. He had spotted her flirting with one of the football players, and she finally dumped him for the bigger, athletic jock. <br />
<br />
Aaron was feeling very lonely and depressed as he stumbled across the quiet, narrow street. In a way, the low-lying fog almost symbolized the mood he was in, for it allowed him to see the relationship with Kristi as exactly that: one big cloud… It had nothing firm or solid about it, and it was doomed from the beginning. She had a thing for big, tall, and muscular guys, and Aaron didn’t fit that bill. Sooner or later, their relationship was going to come to an end, and now he was left all alone again.<br />
<br />
As Aaron looked over, he spotted a large government building at a distance. It almost seemed as if the fog was coming from one of the huge vents. Not only that, but there was a strange odor to the air that he was walking through. Aaron panicked, as he reminded himself that he suffered from allergies and he had a mild case of asthma from time to time. He was only 5 foot 4 inches tall and he was skinny as a rail, with no muscle at all. He was weak and sickly, and he looked like a geek with his glasses on all the time. <br />
<br />
While he stood there, his glasses started to fog up as well. He couldn’t see a thing. He started to breathe hard, and he quickly threw his backpack from his bag and unzipped the top zipper, as soon as the bag landed on the ground. He frantically looked for his inhaler, which was in the top pouch. He took the small device and shook it three times, before placing the mouthpiece in between his lips. He pressed the bottom of the inhaler twice, allowing it to inject two quirts of air into his mouth, clearing his lungs right away. What a relief. Then he took a deep breath and filled his air with the foggy air, before he continued walking.<br />
<br />
No sooner had Aaron taken two steps, or he felt an odd tingling sensation throughout his body, notably his muscles. Then things started happen at a rapid pace. First, his pectorals started to inflate like balloons that were being filled with air. They pushed outward and sideways, growing by almost a foot in all directions and becoming heavier at the same time. This made his shoulders grow wider, and allowed his lats and delts to stiffen up, as they grew into huge mounds of rock-solid muscle as well. His pectorals grew so big, that his buttoned shirt practically blew apart, blowing all the buttons off in a matter of seconds, from the collar to the middle of the shirt!<br />
<br />
“Hey! Wha--? What’s happening to me?” he shouted to himself.<br />
<br />
Next, his arms began to tingle all over! Both his biceps began to vibrate, as they pushed out and formed into huge bowling-balls of solid muscle. His arms grew so thick, that they ripped the seams off the sleeves of the shirt, tearing it to shreds. His arms practically grew twice as wide as before, and his biceps were now super-hard!<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! What is going on?” Aaron gasped, as he looked at his arms. “I’m changing! I’m growing!”<br />
<br />
His flat torso suddenly began to widen and deepen as abdominals started to surface, giving him that ripped look that all bodybuilders have. Within a few seconds, he was sporting an awesome six-pack of abs, which would make any girl go nuts, and any jock green with envy.<br />
<br />
“Uuuhhhhhhhh…. This thing is hitting my body all over… “He groaned, as he felt the tingling travel down to his legs.<br />
<br />
Next, his quads began to widen and deepen considerably, to the point where new layers of muscle began to form at such an alarming rate on his quads that he had to adjust his stance several times because his legs kept on rubbing against each other. His legs had practically doubled in width, with thick ropes of veins surfacing over the new, large muscles.<br />
<br />
“Ooh man…. I’m turning into a muscle freak!” Aaron gasped, as he struggled to look down. He had to bend down to see his legs, because his huge pectorals were blocking his view. “This is incredible!”<br />
<br />
Luckily, Aaron was wearing shorts, but his quads now made his khaki shorts almost look as small as a Speedo! His legs had become so huge, that they had stretched the shorts to the limit. <br />
<br />
Finally, his calves started to vibrate. Then, they started to push out the back of his legs, inflating rapidly and hardening as they grew until they were the size of soccer balls, filling him with strength and power.<br />
<br />
“Oh God… What are they going to say at school?”  Aaron thought. He decided to walk back to school, which was only a few blocks away, when the tingling started again.<br />
<br />
Aaron just made it to the restroom at the football practice field, where there was a large body-length mirror that was bolted to the wall. There he quickly removed the shirt and the shorts, so he could examine his body as he stood in front of the mirror. He couldn’t believe his eyes. In fact, he had to remove his glasses, just because he thought he was dreaming when he saw his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“No way, this can’t be me…” he whispered to himself. “I look like a jock!”<br />
<br />
Then it hit him again. A second wave of tingling began to spread all over his body. A thin patch of hair began to sprout all over his body, starting with his chest.<br />
<br />
“Wha--? Where did that hair come from?” he wondered, as he rain his hand over the hair on his chest.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the small patch grew into a thick layer of hair, which covered the entire area of his pectorals and ran down the center to his abdominals. A fine coat of hair also covered his arms and his legs, from his ankles all the way to his knees. When he felt a tingling in his crotch, he quickly removed his boxers, to see what was going on down there as well.<br />
<br />
Aaron saw his cock grow from 6 inches to 12 inches in length, and his public hair increased in length as well, for at first he had none. His balls grew to the size of apples, becoming big and hard and heavy in the process. As Aaron looked down, he couldn’t help but smile, as he felt a thick coating of hair creep across his back, his neck, and his shoulders. His arms were totally covered now, and the hair on his legs had become even darker. He had become a hairy, muscle beast!<br />
<br />
“Man, I should be able to pick up a girlfriend now…” Aaron smiled, as he tried his hardest to slip into his clothes. He decided to get home and look for some bigger clothes as soon as possible, for these were already much too tight on him. Not only had his body become 30 pounds heavier with muscle, but he had also gained a remarkable layer of hair all over his body at the same time. He couldn’t wait to get to school the following day…<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the strange patch of fog was moving closer to the city, and it was heading ever closer to a densely populated area of town. <br />
<br />
Where would the fog end up next?</p>
