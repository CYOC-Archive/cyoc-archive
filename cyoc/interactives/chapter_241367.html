<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John admired his reflection once more, standing tall in his perfectly tailored three-piece suit. But Apollo, arms crossed, detailed him with a mischievous air.<br />
“Well, my apprentice, here&#39;s your first test.” He pointed his finger at John, “What&#39;s wrong with this outfit?”<br />
John frowned and observed his suit from every angle. The cut was impeccable, the shirt well fitted, the tie knotted to perfection. He ran his hands over his torso, caressing the lapels of his jacket, desperately looking for the mistake.<br />
“I... I don&#39;t know.”<br />
Apollo sighed and shook his head. “Come on, John! It&#39;s elementary, though. With a three-piece suit, you never wear a belt. The waist should be held in place by tabs or suspenders. The belt breaks the unity between the top and bottom of the outfit and creates an unsightly break.”<br />
John nodded, impressed.<br />
“I note... No belt with a three-piece.”<br />
Apollon snapped his fingers. Instantly, the belt disappeared, but the pants suddenly seemed to sag, creating ungraceful creases.<br />
“rah, it&#39;s not possible,” Apollon huffed, ”you really have to do everything yourself. I&#39;m going to take this opportunity to improve you a little too”.<br />
Apollo adjusted John&#39;s pants, which hugged John&#39;s slim hips nicely, then gave a powerful squeeze to john&#39;s shoulders and pecs, which broadened and muscled, now designating him as an attractive mesomorph. His new shoulders accentuated the stoutness of the jacket, and his broader pecs grew under his tie and waistcoat top, heightening his rugged, imperious appearance.<br />
Apollo smiled, “Good. Now let&#39;s move on to something a little less formal.”<br />
He snapped his fingers again. John&#39;s clothes unzipped themselves and returned to their place in the huge dressing room. The fabric slid over his skin, letting a light breeze caress his torso as he was momentarily in his underwear. Then, in an instant, soft beige chino pants wrapped around his legs. They were light, but their slim fit emphasized John&#39;s new silhouette. Next, a white linen shirt appeared on his torso, floating loosely over him. The soft, airy fabric caressed his skin, giving him a new freshness. The sleeves, slightly baggy on his muscular arms, rolled up to his elbows, clearing his forearms and giving him a holiday look. Finally, supple brown leather moccasins settled on his bare feet, hugging their shape with comfort.Apollon opened the buttons of his shirt to mid-torso, exposing his firm muscles, giving an elegant, casual look to the outfit. John watched his reflection. His look was more relaxed, but not sloppy. He looked like a confident man on vacation on the Riviera, ready for a drink on the terrace after a sunny day. He smiled. “This outfit is perfect. How can there be a mistake?”<br />
Apollo raised an eyebrow, knowingly. John watched again and again. Nothing seemed out of place.<br />
Apollo rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. <br />
“A shirt out of pants in an elegant outfit?! That&#39;s the height of sloppiness. This isn&#39;t a beach! The tucked-in shirt gives a neat, structured look.”<br />
The flaps of the shirt tucked fiercely into the pants, obedient to Apollo&#39;s virulence, then a brown leather belt appeared at John&#39;s waist, slightly adjusting the fall of the shirt. At last, the shirt smoothed itself.<br />
John nodded. “I see what you mean. It&#39;s true that it immediately gives a more refined air.”<br />
“Exactly. Now let&#39;s move on to something more formal.”<br />
Once again, a ballet of fabric played around him. Summer clothes left his body smoothly, then a blue two-piece suit took their place. First, a thick, white cotton shirt fitted snugly to his torso, the structured fabric giving him a sensation of impeccable neatness. Next, the perfectly cut midnight-blue pants hugged his legs just right, enhancing his silhouette. Then, the matching jacket settled on his shoulders like a second skin, emphasizing the elegance of his build while allowing total freedom of movement. A dark-blue tie appeared around his neck and tied itself neatly into an impeccable Windsor knot.<br />
John looked at himself in the mirror and smiled. He looked like an accomplished businessman, ready to conquer the world with his natural charisma.<br />
 “I think I&#39;ve figured out the mistake this time.”<br />
Apollo raised an eyebrow, amused. “Oh? Tell me.”<br />
“The jacket&#39;s open while we&#39;re standing. I should button it.”<br />
Apollo clapped his hands with satisfaction. “Bravo, John! Right on! When we&#39;re standing, the jacket should be buttoned to structure the silhouette. It&#39;s only when you sit down that you unbutton it to prevent it from pulling. A detail that distinguishes amateurs from the truly elegant.”<br />
John buttoned the jacket and observed the change in the mirror. The whole looked instantly more harmonious. “Indeed, it changes everything.”<br />
“Good. Last test.”<br />
A shiver ran through John as the fabrics of his blue suit slid out of his body and back into place. Then, a classic tuxedo gradually appeared. The black pants in fine wool, fluid and distinguished, fitted his legs with perfect fall. The crisp-white, off-the-shoulder shirt came to rest on his torso with a rigid, elegant structure. The black silk bow tie formed around his neck, tied by hand (magically this time). Finally, the tuxedo jacket, with its wide, pointed lapels in shimmering satin, settled on his shoulders, giving him presence by composing perfectly between his shoulders and the jacket&#39;s buttoning.<br />
John felt transformed: he was like a character from a classic film, ready to enter a Monte Carlo casino or attend a gala evening. He stood erect, deeply inspired by the new self-confidence his clothes gave him. He glanced admiringly at his reflection. “So, what&#39;s wrong?”<br />
Apollo crossed his arms. “Take a good look.”<br />
John scrutinized every detail, but everything seemed perfect. After a long hesitation, he shrugged. “I don&#39;t see.”<br />
Apollo gently grasped his wrist and raised his hand, revealing a gleaming Rolex watch.<br />
“A watch with a tuxedo? Heresy! Tuxedos are elegant, timeless evening wear. Wearing a watch in the evening implies that you have somewhere to go. A well-educated man, when invited to a party, is there for pleasure, not to keep an eye on the time.”<br />
With a gesture, he made the watch disappear. John looked at his bare wrist and understood.<br />
“It&#39;s all about attitude, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
Apollo nodded. “Exactly. Style, John, is a matter of clothes certainly, but above all of manners and attention to others. And it&#39;s in these details that elegance is born.”<br />
John, inspired, looked at his reflection one last time. He was no longer just a fashion-questioning young man. Under Apollo&#39;s exacting eye, he knew he was on the right way.</p>
