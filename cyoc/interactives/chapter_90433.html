<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wondering what type of life she wanted, Janet decided what she wanted to be. As a child, she had always loved magicians. They had the ability to dazzle the public with clever sleight of hand and grandiose illusions.  She wished that she wanted to be one of them.  But with practice and years of experience, it could take her a long time to be as good as the others.  Now that she has that amulet with her, she can become the magician she dreamed to be.  She would be beloved by everyone. Not only that, but she could get to wear cute outfits too! She imagined her perfect magician: sexy, kind, cheerful, and skilled. The amulet shone bright, and her transformation begun!<br />
<br />
Janet looked to the mirror, nearly jumping in excitement. Well, more accurately, she just got a little bit taller. Not only that, but she grew in other ways too. Her breasts seem to grow a little larger, while figure seemed a little bit curvier as well. Her hair became slightly darker in color, as did her skin. Her clothes, though, seemed to shrink, with her skirt, shirt, and stockings all becoming very small. Still, at least the amulet was working!<br />
<br />
But just as she was getting excited over the change, Janet immediately shrieked!  “Stupid perverted amulet thing!” she said in embarrassment, “Why would make her naked like this!” She now only had her underwear on...and it didn&#39;t even look like hers! They were all black and lacy...and more sexy than what Janet was used to. Her breasts still grew a little, while her hair actually got shorter. Her hair and skin continued to darken, her hair now a dark brown color. She hoped she&#39;d get some clothes on soon!  The last thing she wanted is to perform magic in the nude.<br />
<br />
Janet felt pretty strange now. Her face changed, becoming smoother, thinner, and much more delicate. Her eyes changed, becoming a beautiful green while having an oddly cheerful look. Her hair restyled itself as it became darker. Her breasts grew much larger, while a completely open small white dress shirt appeared around her chest. She now wore stockings, making her feel at least a little bit more comfortable. Looking in the mirror, she had to admit that she was beautiful...she could understand how a crowd could love this!<br />
<br />
As Janet continued to transform, she started buttoning the shirt while her breasts suddenly grew larger, opening it back up again. Her hair grew longer, and darkened considerably. It was now a lighter black. Black heeled boots appeared on her feet as well. Janet couldn&#39;t help but admit she felt great! Her confidence was soaring, not surprising since she had to perform for large crowds! She made a little peace sign to the mirror. This was going pretty well so far! Still...some more clothing might be nice…<br />
<br />
Janet could tell she was almost done! Her skin and hair darkened, giving her a cute but exotic feel. She now wore a leotard under her shirt, covering up her strong abs. She had to work out since she has to perform acrobatic stunts for her shows! A big red bow tie appeared around her neck. It gave her a surprisingly cute look. Janet began to think of her favorite magic tricks and shows. She always loved doing them. Her favorite part was seeing the children&#39;s faces as she made a big trick. Their looks of amazement always kept her smiling...just like right now! She was almost dressed now...  She’s missing the one thing every magician needs, a top hat<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was complete! Her skin got a little bit darker, adding to her beautiful, exotic appeal. A beautiful suit jacket appeared around her arms, perfect for a true magician. Not only that, but she wouldn&#39;t be a great magician without her hat! She gently touched the top hat...good!  She couldn’t help but strike a cute and excited pose!  Soon she&#39;d be amazing people with her magic tricks and cheering up the hearts of thousands.<br />
<br />
The world around her shifted like a painting as it arranged into an environment she’s comfortable with.  She was in a dressing room with a makeup counter, vanity mirror, a closet filled with outfits used for magic, props for a variety of tricks, and a full length mirror she was looking at right now.  Looking around, she was pleased with what she had done.  Just then, new memories entered her brain and was making her remember her new life.  She knows that her name was now, The Great Jay Jay, and she’s one of the top magicians in the world.  She started magic when she was young and over the years, she improved on her skills.  Now here she is, in a dressing room at a very popular theater, ready to perform magic in front of a live audience of thousands.  This is truly a dream come true for her.<br />
<br />
Just then, there was a knock at the door as she could hear a crewmember said on the other side, “Jay Jay!  You’re on in ninety seconds.  You’re needed on stage ASAP!”  Jay Jay turned to the door and said, “Okay!  I’m on the way!”  Adjusting her suit and putting her top hat on, she left the dressing room and headed to the stage, ready to wow the audience.</p>
