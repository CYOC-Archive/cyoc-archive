<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>First part of a commission</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Nothing right now,” Jeff gasped. <br />
<br />
After sex and the afterglow, Jeff and Finn lay on the floor together. The cool water, always running over the plastic tile floors of the house, lapped soothingly against their drying skins. They could try sharing the tank, but unlike their father’s, there was no way the two massive anthros could both fit.<br />
<br />
“That was nice, babe.” Finn smiled, stroking Jeff’s rough shark skin. “Wanna fuck me again?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, but I think I’ll stick to bottoming from now on,” Jeff chuckled awkwardly. “Let’s not make this a habit.”<br />
<br />
“Pssh, I haven’t turned into a bottom after just one fuck,” Finn guffawed. “You weren’t THAT good!”<br />
<br />
“Boy, stop!” Jeff whined, slapping his muscular mater lovingly.<br />
<br />
Finn rose to his feet with a grunt. “Wanna go swimming?”<br />
<br />
“Well…” Jeff paused, unsure of what to say. He wanted to go swimming, but Finn being oblivious to the power of the Chronivac made him feel bad. “Actually, maybe you should come over to the computer, there’s something I have to tell you…”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-==--=-=-=-=-==-=<br />
<br />
A half-hour later, Jeff finished explaining the Chronivac and making sure Finn was aware of the reality alterations.<br />
<br />
“So.. “ Finn said slowly when Jeff was finished. He stared at the muscular shark. “We can change anything at all?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Jeff nodded, his breathing apparatus bubbling excitedly. “Anything at all.”<br />
<br />
“So, objects and stuff?”<br />
<br />
“Anything.” Jeff shrugged expansively. <br />
<br />
“May I…?” Finn pointed at the computer.<br />
<br />
“Sure! But, ah, let&#39;s not do big changes. Only really, really small things.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Like?” The orca asked<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s pretend I was human and had a gross mole on my face. Removing that is fine. Adding some sporadic gym visits is fine too.” the shark replied.<br />
<br />
“Why are you so cautious?” Finn, the orca asked. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
“The device causes reality alterations. I know you don’t notice because I had your awareness set to off. Actually, to prove it to you, make an incredibly small change to me with my awareness set to ‘off’.” Jeff pointed.<br />
<br />
“Like?”<br />
<br />
“Like...I dunno, the color of my shirt or eyes or something.&quot; Finn opened his maw and Jeff placed his webbed hand on the orca&#39;s muzzle. &quot;No! Don’t tell me. Make sure it’s something you know for a fact.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…hold on, let me think.” Finn frowned, before typing something into the device and hitting enter.<br />
 <br />
Jeff closed his eyes and felt a brief sensation of energy coursing through his body before it dissipated.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I did it,” Finn said, looking at Jeff expectantly.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his eyes and looked down at himself. He blinked a few times and then looked back up at Finn.<br />
<br />
“Did you change my shirt color?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Finn nodded. “Yeah, I made it a darker blue. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
Jeff examined his shirt and shrugged. “It&#39;s fine, I guess. I don&#39;t really care about the color of my shirt.”<br />
<br />
Finn looked disappointed. “Oh. I thought it would be a nice change.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled reassuringly. “It is. I appreciate the effort, really. It&#39;s just that...I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not really that important.”<br />
<br />
Finn nodded slowly, still looking a little dejected. “I guess you&#39;re right. Maybe we should focus on bigger things.”<br />
<br />
“Actually,” Jeff said, looking around the room. “I think we should stop using the Chronivac altogether. We don&#39;t know what kind of consequences our actions could have.”<br />
<br />
Finn looked up at him in surprise. “What? Why?”<br />
<br />
“I just have a feeling,” Jeff said, his voice low. “I think we&#39;ve been playing with fire, and we need to be more careful.”<br />
<br />
Finn looked down at the Chronivac, feeling a little disappointed. He had been looking forward to exploring the limits of if with Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Finn said, his voice subdued. “We&#39;ll put it away for now.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, a sense of relief washing over him.<br />
<br />
“Can you get me a soda, babe?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure, be right back,” Jeff gave him a sharky smile and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Finn turned back to the Chronivac and started punching things in.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-==-=-<br />
<br />
Jeff rummaged through the fridge, trying to find the soda Finn liked. <br />
<br />
His wetsuit was starting to feel a bit constricting, so he pulled the rubbery material away. It slapped snuggly back into place. Jeff rolled his shoulders uncomfortably, feeling the straps of his shirt roll into a more pleasant position.<br />
<br />
The sharkman’s webbed fingers finally found a bottle of Shoremaster Blast and took it out.<br />
<br />
As he bent over to pull another bottle out, he felt his wet suit constrict around his crotch. He squirmed uncomfortably as he felt his genitals squeezed into some kind of tight pouch. His suit stretched to contain his maleness, though he could suddenly feel cool air on the meat of his cocks.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down in time to see his dull wetsuit turn shiny and black around his crotch, the material stiffening into a leather jockstrap.<br />
<br />
As he watched, the rest of his outfit shrank in on itself, forming shiny black straps made of leather. Metal rings linked the straps all across Jeff’s form. They slid against his rough shark skin as they found their positions, highlighting his muscles. There was a sudden tension as Jeff’s muscles ballooned larger, straining the straps.<br />
<br />
The sharkman blinked, bouncing one of his pecs playfully, enjoying the feeling of the straps. He wore a leather harness because it made him feel sexy. Sometimes he’d even wear it under his clothes when he went outside. Knowing he was wearing such a kinky outfit, barely concealed by a wetsuit, was a huge turn on.<br />
<br />
He took the sodas and walked back up the stairs. The straps of his harness cradled his muscular asscheeks nicely as he walked, highlighting every flex and bounce with each step he took. Jeff was halfway up the stairs when a sudden pressure filled his ass.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Jeff jumped, nearly toppling down the stairs as a big, thick object lodged itself firmly up his butt.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he was confused as to how a dildo had managed to lodge itself up his ass. Then memories of always having something to fill his needy hole filled his mind. This was how he made sure he was stretched and ready for his big orca boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled cockily and continued up the stairs, the straps of his harness shoving the dildo into him, rubbing his prostate, then pulling it out. In and out, every step causing Jeff to spurt precum into his leather jockstrap. He moaned but kept walking, feeling incredibly hot about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Arriving at his room, the shark knocked on the door and leaned against the frame.<br />
<br />
“Hey baby,” Jeff winked, running a hand over his body and winked. “Want a drink?”<br />
<br />
Finn glanced up at Jeff and smiled. “You’re looking amazing.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, I try my best,” Jeff grinned again, strutting seductively over to the orca. “Want me to suck you off while you play a game?”<br />
<br />
Finn blushed. “So you don’t notice anything different?”<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned, “should I?”<br />
<br />
“No, I just changed the color of your harness from brown to black.” Finn lied, smiling up at his much sluttier boyfriend.<br />
<br />
As he moved his legs to give Jeff better access to his crotch, Finn considered if he’d gone too far.<br />
<br />
Then Jeff’s maw was around his cock and he didn’t think of anything except pleasure.</p>
