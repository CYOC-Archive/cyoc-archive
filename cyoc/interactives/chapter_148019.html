<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake quickly pulled off all of his clothes. He picked up the pair of spandex workout shorts. He had gotten these as a gift when he had started running. Apparently spandex supported your genitals well. Jake had refused, because while it supported well, it also showed the world that he really had not much down there. But maybe that would change today.<br />
<br />
Jake pulled them on. Absolutely no bulge showed on the front of the shorts. Jake was disgusted. Opening the app, he first tried his new &quot;normal&quot; size of 5 inches soft and 6 inches erect. Jake watched as what appeared to be a baby carrot slowly inflated to a more normal size, one that he would expect on any average boy at his school. There was a small bulge but nothing really extraordinary. Jake couldn&#39;t wait to really turn up the heat. But he decided to go slowly.<br />
<br />
Opening the app again, Jake adjusted the sliders into the area he defined as &quot;big&quot;. That meant adding 2 inches to every measurement and upping his ball size. Jake keyed in the appropriate measures for 6 inches soft and 7 inches hard. He also adjusted the ball slider to 4 (egg sized) and hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Gleefully, Jake watched as the small outline of his cock inside his shorts got bigger. His balls began to swell up, bigger and bigger until they filled out the front of the shorts with two bulges that almost resembled two large eggs that he had stuffed in there. Then his shorts began to deform as his cock lengthened and thickened up. It was now a respectable size, and just slightly too big for his shorts. They bulged out with the outline of a bigger-than-average cock underneath the fabric as they struggled to contain Jake&#39;s now sizable endowment.<br />
<br />
Almost teasingly at this point, Jake added just one inch to his cock&#39;s measurements and hit Enter. The already fairly-big bulge grew even more, as Jake&#39;s cock, now thoroughly out of room in his shorts, pushed outwards. Jake was practically salivating at the seemingly monstrous bulge he now had, but he had more in store. Opening the app for the last time, Jake upped the sliders to the same settings he had before: A full fat 12 inches soft and 14 inches erect. But he paused... could he even go higher? He could always undo it later, right? Jake slid both sliders upwards more... settling for 15 inches soft and 18 inches erect. He keyed in a new size for his balls as well, upping them to 7 (softball-sized). Then he settled in to watch the show.<br />
<br />
First, his balls began to swell, pressing the fabric of the shorts out further. Already a sizable bulge, they began to stretch the shorts out, growing larger and larger. As Jake&#39;s balls passed the size of tennis balls, they actually became so large that Jake had to spread his legs wider to accommodate the increasing amount of bulk between his legs. His balls passed the size of large apples, and finally settled on the size of large softballs. It looked ridiculous, and the balls were so oversized for his still (in comparison) relatively small cock.<br />
<br />
Then, Jake&#39;s already big cock began to get fatter and longer. Now pushing 10 inches, it began to deform and stretch the fabric of his shorts further. Jake could clearly see his large cockhead through the shorts, because his cock was being pressed against the fabric by the pressure building inside the shorts. He moaned loudly, as the enormous pressure translated into pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s cock was now a full 12 inches long, and it was still growing. However, the shorts managed to hold it all in, though they concealed absolutely nothing. Jake&#39;s cock was on full display in his shorts, with every vein on the surface visible. He could see his long thick shaft as it ran down part of his leg before flaring out into his large mushroom-shaped cockhead. Below his cock, twin bulges the size of softballs indicated where Jake&#39;s balls were.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jake&#39;s cock stopped inching down his leg and thickening. Jake couldn&#39;t believe that the shorts had held. He had wanted them to break! He opened the app again, and upped the settings again. He did the same for his balls.<br />
<br />
Again, his balls began to swell. Jake had to shift his legs apart even wider to accommodate the pair of now volleyball-sized nuts between his legs. But despite the enormous amount of stretching the shorts were experiencing, they still wouldn&#39;t break. Jake quickly pulled his long cock out of his leg and stuffed it all into the center between his legs. Maybe that would focus the pressure on the shorts, he reasoned.<br />
<br />
Again, Jake&#39;s cock began to balloon outwards as it expanded again. His cock snaked around his balls, pumping up, straining the fabric even more. His cock was bound in tightly, almost too tight. Suddenly, the shorts ripped down the middle, and out burst Jake&#39;s huge 18 inch long soft cock, as well as his volleyball nuts. But they weren&#39;t done! Jake&#39;s cock continued to pump up, passing 20 inches, then 22 until it finally stopped growing at 24 inches, the maximum allowed by the app. With pride, Jake gazed on his two foot long cock with joy.</p>
