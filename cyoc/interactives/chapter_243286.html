<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fukushu couldn&#39;t help but smile to himself as Cole Harris reluctantly agreed with him that Fukushu&#39;s way of grill etiquette was a little superior to his way. Cole could taste a slight difference when he took a bite out of the patty that Fukushu had cooked.<br />
<br />
Fukushu was grabbing himself a plate when he noticed Mason introducing Raiden and Stella to his grandfather Hideo Tozawa, with Anjelica standing next to Mason. Raiden and Stella bowed politely towards Hideo and watched as the two exchanged a few words with Hideo before the elderly man encouraged the young teens to go have fun. Fukushu grabbed himself two burgers as well as two bottles of herbal tea and went over to Hideo&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings to you Hideo,&quot; Fukushu greeted Hideo with a bow. &quot;I brought you one of the burgers I cooked as well as some herbal tea. You.....looked like you needed company.&quot; Fukushu guessed sitting down as Hideo took the burger and drink and offered Fukushu an empty chair next to him.<br />
<br />
Hideo and Fukushu sat there silently for a moment watching all the young relatives having fun and laughing along with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you didn&#39;t just come to sit with this old man out of pity.&quot; Hideo said as he took a bite of his burger.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not at all. Frankly, I realized that we.....haven&#39;t interacted much in the last couple of years that I have been watching Mika and Claudia&#39;s children.&quot; Fukushu admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I realize that, but I hold no jealousy to you or your wife in that regard. You both are no doubt far older than I could ever guess, but you&#39;re both still spry as a spring chicken. Or I guess in your regards, a spring fox.&quot; Hideo said as he gave a little laugh and Fukushu gave a little laugh alongside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you speaking with my children before I came over.&quot; Fukushu now said looking over where Raiden and Stella were with Mason and Anjelica and playing a game of horseshoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, both very polite children, you&#39;re raising them well. Although I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, when Mason came back he told me all about you.&quot; Hideo revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He....he did? But...?&quot; Fukushu said a little startled, his anger beginning to rise before Hideo held up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm yourself old man, Mason didn&#39;t tell me anything too personal. But he did speak highly of you. He told me how you trained him with a sword, how you both fought on the field of battle together with his sisters. But he said his favorite moment he shared with you was the very first time you gave him a hug.&quot; Hideo explained.<br />
<br />
Fukushu knew the moment Hideo was referring to, and although he wouldn&#39;t say it outright, it was a moment he kept close to his heart too. They both looked back over to Mason and the others as he motioned for Raiden, Stella, and Anjelica to go play horseshoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason also told me he sees you as a father figure.&quot; Hideo now said as Fukushu looked a little surprised. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not jealous or anything. I&#39;m happy just being his kindly old grandfather just like your father is to him.&quot; Hideo finished as Fukushu just nodded.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now looked around him at all the relatives who were there for Yuriko&#39;s graduation and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So besides our relatives and age, what else do you think we have in common?&quot; Fukushu asked now wanting to change the subject.<br />
<br />
Hideo gave it some thought before answering the old fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to guess, I believe we both had to learn to accept others. My Reiko has been gone many years now and I miss her every day, but I am glad for the time we got to spend together and that we both were able to learn to accept Mika for who she is before her untimely passing.&quot; Hideo admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;It is always difficult to accept a loss. Especially one who meant so much to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound like you&#39;re speaking from experience,&quot; Hideo said. &quot;Care to elaborate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, thinking of his losses over the years. His siblings Raiden and Yomi. His master Akane. His first pupil Isao. So many kitsune who had died in war. So many kitsune horribly maimed under his command. The numbers were staggering, and brought the fearsome general pain just thinking about it. It was though, his cross to bare.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no I don&#39;t think I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hideo was quiet, studying the kitsune carefully. It was difficult for the man, having never served in the military, but he had seen that look in veterans he knew. Fukushu had seen the horrors of war, watched soldiers under his command suffer or die. Centuries of warfare had molded the kitsune, making him emotionally distant. Prying any further would accomplish nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I understand,&quot; Hideo said softly. &quot;Forget I asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, a small smirk upon his face as he watched his children play. While the older ones now sat around drinking, the younger ones were taking advantage of the vacant horseshoe pit.<br />
<br />
Mason and Raiden now laughed and talked as Stella and Anjelica threw horseshoes. The girls slowly getting to know one another. Nearby, Sachiko talked with Tammy Harris and her cousin Ashley Tozawa, Kenji and Sota raced around the yard persued by Autumn and Felicity Harris and Boby Tozawa. There was a tranquil beauty to the scene. The laughter and joy of this get together brightening the kitsunes spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for inviting us Hideo,&quot; Fukushu said softly. &quot;This is proving to be far more enjoyable than I would have anticipated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing the joy on these young ones faces is all the joy I need at my age. With what&#39;s happening out there in the world....&quot; Hideo said giving a long sigh. &quot;Well, it may sound foolish, but I wish I could give those cruel people out there a piece of my mind. There&#39;s nothing I want more than to protect my family no matter what.&quot; Hideo finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;On that matter, we agree Hideo.&quot; Fukushu nodded as Hideo took a bite out of the burger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must also agree that you are a fine cook with this meat.&quot; Hideo complimented as Fukushu gave a small chuckle and patted him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Back at the horseshoes, Mason and Raiden were now playing horseshoes while Stella and Anjelica talked with one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what exactly does one do at a sleepover?&quot; Stella asked Anjelica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, lots of things, we can paint each others nails, do our hair, play truth or dare, build a pillow fort. My sister did that a lot with me when I was little. I....never really had too many friends who were girls growing up.&quot; Anjelica explained to Stella.<br />
<br />
&quot;That does sound like a lot of fun. Maybe we could ask my parents and grandparents if it would be okay to have a sleepover at the palace together.&quot; Stella suggested as Anjelica nodded with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that sounds like it would be amazing! You could show me around the palace too, I didn&#39;t get to see a whole lot because of the war going on. Kari&#39;s boyfriend Genki has a little sister named Nanami, I could ask her if she wants to join us too.&quot; Anjelica suggested as Stella nodded liking the idea more and more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll ask my parents first if that&#39;s okay with them.&quot; Stella said as she found her mother to her surprise standing with Mika and Claudia and having a drink with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Stella asked as Abolith looked over at her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; Abolith asked wondering what her daughter could possibly want.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....was wondering if....uh.....if I could have a sleepover at the palace and invite Anjelica and Kari&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s little sister Nanami over as well?&quot; Stella asked with a happy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;A sleepover? Well......I suppose since there&#39;s nothing going on at the moment over there. But you must also ask your father&#39;s permission and have Anjelica ask her parents as well.&quot; Abolith said as Stella happily nodded and went over to find her father.<br />
<br />
Stella happily ran over to her father as Anjelica called her mothers to ask them for their permission as well. She found him still sitting with Hideo Tozawa as the two were still having a light chat as Stella came up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? I...I was wondering if I may have a sleepover at the palace with Anjelica as well as Kari&#39;s boyfriend Genki&#39;s young sister Nanami? Please? Mom said it would be okay if I asked your permission first.&quot; Stella asked as Fukushu scratched his chin in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....so long as you three behave while you&#39;re there, I suppose I will also approve.&quot; Fukushu said as Stella smiled and gave her father a quick hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anjelica, my father says it will be alright for us to have a sleepover.&quot; Stella said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I just finished talking with my moms, they say it&#39;s okay with them.&quot; Anjelica said as she jumped up and down excitedly.<br />
<br />
Yuriko turned back around after hearing Anjelica and Abolith excited about the sleepover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, remember that sleepover we had at the Moreland&#39;s house that one time?&quot; Yuriko said to Haley, Kari, and Lynne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean that time Charlotte took us out in the middle of the night to show off how good she was at shooting empty cans in the dead of the night?&quot; Kari guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah! I remember that, we were playing truth or dare and I dared her to do that.&quot; Haley laughed as she sipped her beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I remember is hearing Mrs. Moreland scold you all about shooting guns off in the middle of the night.&quot; Aaron laughed as Nyx also gave a little smile and laugh as Aaron had his arm on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she also forbade Charlotte from using her rifle for two weeks after that. When she finally got it back, it was like having her favorite pet back again.&quot; Yuriko remembered as everyone now laughed.<br />
<br />
Yuriko turned around to look at her large family that was gathered around from the young to the old and thought nothing was better than the moment she was sharing with them all.</p>
