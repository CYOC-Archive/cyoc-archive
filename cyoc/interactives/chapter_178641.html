<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three men spoke amongst themselves, understanding the task that had been set for them. At heart, they were still the same people they always were, merely gifted with new bodies and a zealous desire to please the voice that had transformed them.<br />
<br />
“So, Greg’s the Sage…?” Mark purred as he stretched out in his lithe jaguar body. “Makes sense. He’s got a good head on him. Can’t wait to see how he looks in orange.”<br />
<br />
“Which ‘head’ are you talking about, Mark?” Kenneth mused wryly, his sense of humor showing through despite his new wolf body. “The one on his neck or the one in his pants?”<br />
<br />
Richard chuckled at his friend’s little joke, appreciating the deep voice his bear body afforded him. He experimentally jabbed his spear into the air, relishing the strength and expertise that he never would have had in his frail human body. And his new role as the Guardian instilled in him a desire to protect his friends from any danger, and right now that meant finding their fourth member.<br />
<br />
“Mark, Ken,” Richard rumbled in his smooth baritone. “We can’t sit around here joking around. It’s past dark, and Greg is in danger the longer he is left alone.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I suppose you’re right, big bear,” Mark replied, kissing his friend gently on the muzzle. “Let’s find him and give him his gift.”<br />
<br />
Kenneth and Richard nodded and set their weapons aside before each man wrapped a loincloth around their midsections. With their equipment secured, the three men chosen by the temple set out into the dark jungle, ready to find their fourth companion.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Greg was huddled up underneath a large tree, nibbling on a starchy and slightly bitter vegetable he had scavenged while darting his eyes all around, praying that a hungry animal didn’t decide he looked like an easy meal.<br />
<br />
“This sucks. I’m stuck on a deserted island, nobody knows I’m here, and my friends all missing,” he quietly whispered, trying to shake off his loneliness by talking to himself. “Oh god, what am I gonna do…? No, I just need to make it until morning. I can find the others and we’ll make a raft or something, fill it with food and get out of here…”<br />
<br />
Greg’s frantic muttering didn’t attract any dangerous animals, but it did alert Kenneth’s sharp wolf ears to his position immediately. He signaled to the other two and they slowly closed in on their friend, not wanting to frighten him. However, Richard’s heavy bear feet broke branches loudly, letting Greg know that he was not alone in the jungle.<br />
<br />
Greg held his breath and listened closely for any further noises. From the bushes, he heard a voice speaking to him, deep and confident, but in a language he couldn’t understand. Greg wondered if perhaps this island wasn’t as deserted as he thought and cautiously approached the bushes. Suddenly, an enormous hairy shape emerged from the darkness, and in the moonlight Greg could see the head of a bear.<br />
<br />
“Shit, shit, shit!” he shouted as he scrambled off as fast as he could from the hairy beast, running off into the dark jungle without knowing where he would end up. As he ran, he spotted another shape moving ahead of him, and he saw the clear outline of a wolf’s muzzle in the dim moonlight, so he took a quick turn to avoid the beast.<br />
<br />
He continued to run as fast as possible, until he slammed into something. No, make that someone. He felt soft skin and powerful muscles, and he looked up to see a slender yet powerful young man with dark skin gently cradling him in his arms. Greg had no clue who this man was, but at least he was another human being.<br />
<br />
“P-please, you need to help me! My friends… And all these animals…” he sputtered, hoping that his point was being made to this unknown young man, who only smiled and pulled Greg into a soft embrace.<br />
<br />
Mark was glad that he had chosen to use his attractive human form again, even though he much preferred his jaguar form. He gently spoke to Greg, trying to make it clear that he meant him no harm and could keep him safe. He gestured deeper into the jungle, miming that he could give Greg food and shelter if he came with him.<br />
<br />
Greg nodded in understanding and hurried after Mark, enthralled by his beauty and desperate for human contact after being separated from his friends for so long, unaware that his friends were much closer than he knew.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
Greg marveled at the incredible temple that Mark led him to, closely examining the statues and other intricately carved stonework. Mark took him by the hand and led him toward the tree that grew in the ritual chamber, and the two men sat down beneath it to relax. Mark continued to speak to his friend in his new language, telling him exactly what was in store for him despite knowing Greg could not understand him. Mark laughed mischievously at this little game of his, then leaned in to nuzzle his friend’s neck, nibbling his ear and planting little kisses up and down his cheek.<br />
<br />
Greg almost wanted to push this mysterious young man off of him, knowing he had more important things to worry about. But, something about him made Greg feel so safe and loved that he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. In fact, he impulsively leaned in closer, pressing their lips together and beginning to passionately make out with the (apparently) native man who had saved his life. “Thank you so much…” he moaned between kisses, wondering if the man could even understand his gratitude. “You saved me… I’ll do anything for you.”<br />
<br />
Mark smiled hearing this; though he could no longer speak to his friend, he could still understand him and knew that it was time to offer Greg his gift. After kissing his friend a bit longer, Mark stood and plucked a fruit from the tree, then pulled off a piece of it to place delicately into Greg’s mouth. Greg chewed it all up gratefully, and before long the entire fruit was resting in his stomach. He felt a wave of warmth spreading through him and wobbled on his feet, only to be caught in the arms of a strong figure behind him.<br />
<br />
His vision was growing hazy, but he clearly saw the enormous figure cradling him; not a man, not a bear, but something that was both. A great beast of a man, radiating power and an aura of protection, with a long braided beard and kind green eyes. Unlike back in the jungle, Greg felt safe once more, and he looked around to see that the man who had brought him to this temple had become a beautiful jaguar man, while an equally handsome and mysterious wolf was slinking out of the shadows. The trio of beastly yet incredibly beautiful men surrounding him made his dick throb in need, soaking his underwear in precum as he imagined all the things they could do to him in his weakened state.<br />
<br />
“The fourth is here. One choice remains, to embrace the Sage or to leave forever,” a deep voice rang out through Greg’s entire body, making his cock tingle and grow even more erect with its commanding tone. A vision flashed though Greg’s mind, of a wise and commanding tiger, a true leader in every sense of the word. “Is this your desire? Spill your seed at the altar and complete your awakening.”<br />
<br />
Across the room stood one statue, positioned temptingly next to the passageway leading back outside. Greg’s mind swirled with conflicting thoughts… Did the voice speak the truth? Could he simply leave and never return? And more importantly, was that even what he wanted? The soft paws of his friends teasing every inch of his horny body didn’t seem to want that, but in the end the choice came down to him…</p>
