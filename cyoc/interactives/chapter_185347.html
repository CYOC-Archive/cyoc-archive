<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun was setting by the time Rachel left the Jenkin&#39;s home.  Rachel stood on the sidewalk as she decided which way she should go.  In one direction was the hospital where she could get some birth control pills.  In the other direction was her home where she should be going after finishing doing homework with her werecow friend Melissa.  After a few minutes, she decided to go to the hospital.  She knew she wanted to join were society, and for a while, she wasn&#39;t sure which group to join.  However, as she walked, she made up her mind.<br />
<br />
Something her friend Mel told her as she was in her fursona form really stuck to Rachel.  There are two reasons to join a group, either you love a person in that group or you love that group.  While she did have fun with Aaron, and she wouldn&#39;t mind being a werefox, she was still uncertain if she wanted to join that group or not.  Being a werebear appealed to her more, though.  She still had a fondness for bears as her present collection of teddy bears might attest, and after talking with Jack, being a werebear really did appeal to her.  She liked the attitudes that werebears had, and she could imagine herself as a werebear.  She looked at her hand and flexed her fingers, pretending that her fingernails were a set of claws.  She then swiped the air with her imaginary claws as she giggled.  She could imagine herself as a werebear, although she had only seen a werebear in that book she got when they moved to Moon Lake.  It wasn&#39;t long before the Moon Lake hospital appeared in view, and Rachel entered the front doors of the hospital.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked around as she entered the hospital and quickly found the reception desk.  She approached the desk and noticed a rather young-looking woman manning the desk.  &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Rachel said rather quietly, &quot;Could you...um...tell me...er....where I could find the...um....get some birth control pills?&quot;  She felt her face flush red as she made her inquiry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the receptionist said as she looked at Rachel, &quot;Normally the pharmacy is the place you&#39;d go for that.&quot;  The receptionist gave a gentle sniff of the air before continuing.  &quot;But the pharmacy closed at four.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Rachel said as she took a glance at the clock.  She noticed that it was approaching five.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you come back tomorrow, we could take care of you,&quot; the receptionist said, &quot;And you&#39;ll need to bring a parent or guardian.&quot;  Rachel felt her face flush again as she had to have that talk again with her mom and dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rachel said in response, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  As she said that, she saw the receptionist waving at her as she turned away back towards the hospital entrance.  As she walked out, Rachel noticed that the sun was set and night had fallen on the town.  Rachel was in an unfamiliar part of town and wasn&#39;t sure which direction she needed to get home.  After taking a few minutes to look around, she decided to take a left on the sidewalk.  She faintly recalled that the town was shaped in a wheel, and she figured it wouldn&#39;t be too long before she saw a familiar landmark, like the high school or the Tachibana estate.  However, the path that she ended up taking headed towards the outer parts of town, and with it being dark, the weres started to become active.  Something that was made apparent to Rachel as the woods seemed to come alive with sounds of growls and roars.  As she heard her first roar, she paused her walking as she looked towards the woods for the source.  The woods were rather thick and she couldn&#39;t see into them very deeply, yet her ears heard what may have been going on.  She continued her walk until she heard a different noise coming from the woods.<br />
<br />
Above the growls and roars, she could hear something that sounded like rhythmic moans.  It was rather deep, yet feminine compared to the other roars she&#39;d heard.  &quot;No...no way,&quot; she said to herself.  It sounded like something...someone was having sex in the woods, although Rachel couldn&#39;t see anything.  As she stared into the woods and hearing the moaning, a debate raged in her head.  She knew the woods could be dangerous in the woods, and going in there, she could be risking changing as her dad did.  She wasn&#39;t exactly ready to join were society yet, and it was very risky for her to go into the woods.  Yet, her curiosity took the best of her as she wondered what kind of weres were in there, and a part of her was a bit turned on at the idea of watching two people...two weres...having sex in view of her.  She bit her lip slightly as she shifted her legs while she had that little debate in her head.  At first, she turned to continue towards what she thought was home, but at the last second, she turned to go into the woods instead to the source of the moaning.</p>
