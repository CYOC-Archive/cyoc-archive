<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen stammered a quick excuse and began to walk to her room as she anxiously prepared for her first ass-fuck. Closing the door behind her, she sat legs-up in front of her mirror. With a sinking stomach and morbid fascination she watched the musculature beneath the blank skin of her rear divide steadily transition from a “.” to “o” to “O”, staying open for a while before beginning the process anew with a full pull-out as she covered her mouth to hold her soft moans. Every deep thrust into her asshole brought a new wave of pleasure as the combination of her prior experimentation with it, the constant stimulation after it’s theft, and some of the curse’s secondary effects had turned her anus from an organ for excretion to a tight, sensitive tube of flesh capable of bringing Jen to orgasm as quickly as her vagina if not more so, regardless of her wishes.<br />
<br />
Capable of standing up but not of walking, she pressed her knees together, turned around, and continued to watch her reflection over her shoulder. <i>You’re going to pay for this, I swear…</i> thought Jen, but beyond the angry wide eyes and furrowed forehead of her upper face, her promise felt hollow as the ice queen of Glendale high school looked at herself half bent-over with one hand on her knees and one over her mouth. She’d had two months of having plugs stuffed up her ass against her will and she still had no clue as to who was even behind it. The cheerleader helplessly continued to get fucked in the ass while she watched her stuck-out butt cheeks over her shoulder. As her O continued to expand and contract, her pussy caught her attention as it began to overflow on the nightstand, where she had left it next to her rock-solid nipples. She watched it continue to juice up towards orgasm right next to her mirror, her private humiliation worsening as now only her thoughts and tearful expression were the only parts of her not acting like a bitch in heat.<br />
<br />
“Mhm! Mmm! Mhm!” Jennifer’s moaning got louder as she reached the edge. Her mind was fearful at the prospect of living the rest of her life as someone’s anal fleshlight, but her body was aroused at the pleasure it was receiving. “MMMMMMMhhhh!” Jen’s legs began to shake uncontrollably as she came with her ass alone for the first time and collapsed onto the floor, passing out. Nick came a few seconds later, sighing with satisfaction as, behind the patch of blank skin on the other side of her sphincter, he finished spurting the first load deep into Jennifer’s guts. <i>With more to come</i> he thought with a smirk. As he withdrew after a few minutes, the tightness of her contracting anus had milked most of the excess cum from his cock.<br />
<br />
Jen regained consciousness to the feeling of cum coating her defiled inner sanctum, and a moment of shock as she felt the rim of her rear hole, widely gaped after being continuously stretched for 2 months, get washed and gently scrubbed by a finger. Without the haze of sex muddling her thoughts, she realized her asshole’s current owner was treating her just like a male sex toy, which irritated her immensely. But something was strange; she <i>wasn’t</i> being washed out on the inside. Nick, meanwhile, had taken Jennifer’s asshole back to his room, where he took a few small things out of his drawer…<br />
<br />
<i>Dammit, that hurt! Now there’s something weird around me.</i> Jen thought she could feel her anus get pinched, then wedged between something or another, but she also felt cold air around parts of the puckered hole. <i> At least there’s nothing IN me. Finally, I haven’t been able to close myself in so long…</i> Jen let her muscles relax, her sphincter could fully rest for the first time in months as she lay on the floor. <i>It still feels slimy inside though. Maybe he’s not looking and I can push some out.</i> Making a small stain in someone’s room wasn’t much of a revenge for them taking your asshole both literally and metaphorically, but Jen could at least show she had some fight left in her. But as she bore down and pushed out, she quickly realized she had no choice in the matter as the thing containing her asshole held it in a vice-like grip that kept it completely closed. <i>You gross fuck.</i> As she felt the spunk slosh around in her rectum, Jen didn’t know who she was addressing as she clenched her fist at the sight of her slightly-moistening pussy. She grabbed it along with her nipples and a towel as she went to the bathroom for a very long shower.<br />
<br />
As Nick got into bed, he turned to the tightly-shut asshole on his nightstand, held closed by three miniature rubber bands. <i>I’ll let you sleep it off as a first-time reward for doing your job. Tomorrow the plug’s going right in afterwards though.</i> He watched it squirm for a little while still fruitlessly trying to expel his jizz before taking out his phone. As he scrolled through social media, he considered whether to keep his toy secret or to share the knowledge with some of his closer friends, all of whom were also “uncool” kids who’d been picked on. On a whim, he accessed Jennifer Smith’s social media page. As he scrolled through the pictures down to a one of her at the gym, squatting in yoga pants as a transparently-obvious tease, he felt his rod stand to attention once more. <i>On second thought, nah.</i> He took off the rubber bands and accessed Jennifer’s social orifice.<br />
<br />
Jen sat up in bed as a hard dick opened up her rear end. As her ass started getting plowed for the second time that night, she sat there with an intense expression on her face. Her conflicted mind reflected on her hatred for whoever was using her, the pointlessness of her struggles until now, and the orgasm she had had earlier. She picked up her pussy and depositing it on her pillow, flipping onto her stomach to stared right at her snatch. Jennifer stared for a long time. Then, slowly bowing her head, she began to lick her clit and finger her pussy while her anus began milking the cock plundering her depths.</p>
