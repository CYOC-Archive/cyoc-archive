<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So I was in college, and it was the middle of No Nut November, and I’d just stopped taking my meds, right,” Troy’s newest victim said.<br />
<br />
“Mmmhmm…” Troy replied not really paying attention. <br />
<br />
Troy refocused as he looked away from the screen. He was currently processing the individual’s wolfman video. He got little pleasure out of this guy; Troy was just happy to wash his hands of him. The guy was a man named John… something. He hadn’t bothered checking, because it wouldn’t matter in a few hours anyways. Troy found it hard to care about him, he was a wacko. <br />
<br />
John was chosen because he had a criminal history and was clearly nuts. Troy had paid for his plane ticket from Florida and wrote the cost off as a part of doing business. There wouldn’t be any extra money from raiding the guy’s bank accounts because… well… he didn’t have any money. John was likely destined for a life of burdening the system, so Troy thought it best he made someone happy instead.<br />
<br />
The buyer was flying in from Japan, so he was taking his time and making sure the video was edited properly this time. They wanted a bug, a stag beetle to be precise, which was very rare. $90,000 dollars had been nothing to scoff at, but he didn’t want to change someone who had a future into an insect that would only be alive for another few months at most.<br />
<br />
“My dick was rock hard, and there was this guy in class, a cute gay boy, right? He had a nice ass, looked like a girl’s. I hadn’t gotten off in the last three weeks…” John continued, yellow wolf eyes staring off into the distance and his tail wagging as he reminisced.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow really,” Troy said with zero enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
In the present, he didn’t feel bad at all that he didn’t give the guy the time of day.<br />
<br />
Troy looked at the calendar; Three weeks was the amount of time he’d been at this so far. Not all of his clients had been male. A few females had shown up and he’d end up selling them as Fillies or cows. One he’d sold off as purebred Tibetan mastiff bitch. That sale had netted him almost $20K. All that money, unfortunately, was sitting unused. The check was left uncashed. He tried to figure out why and apparently that first $10K check had triggered an audit.<br />
<br />
So now he had to figure out how to ‘launder’ money. Dustin sat beside him on the couch, and he pet his beloved dog. He’d basically forgotten all about his friend Dustin. Dustin’s parents had called the other day, asking Troy if he’d seen their son. Troy was honest – he hadn’t seen him in weeks and the guy wasn’t answering his calls because his phone was off. He had suggested that Dustin might be unemployed and would probably come around if things grew too desperate.<br />
<br />
Poor Dustin he thought. Three weeks was a long time to be a dog. He was just such a good boy that when Troy remembered Dustin was originally human he didn’t want to turn him back. He was really starting to love having a pet around. As a way of justifying it, Troy thought that Dustin wanted to be a dog. Sure, Troy had tricked originally him when he was transformed, but look at how happy Dustin is now. Such a good boy deserved a good life. One more week. Maybe.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. He now had another thing to worry about because of Dustin. Eventually the cops would come around and, since Troy was the last person who’d seen Dustin, focus their investigation on him. There was an easy solution to that of course: turn Dustin back. He had no idea how mad his friend would be. Control didn’t work on humans, so he would have to fight him for ownership of the Book if it came to that. The idea that Dustin might turn Troy into a dog as revenge had also crossed his mind, a scary thought. It was safer this way.<br />
<br />
Changing Dustin back came with its own benefits besides getting the police off his back. It would also mean getting some good criminal advice. All these problems with money and legal worries would go away once Dustin started dealing with them. Troy tried to think of ways to change him back and convince him to go into a partnership with him. The problem with that plan was that Dustin wasn’t poor. If Troy didn’t have money to offer Dustin, what would Dustin take as an offer to work with him? It was a problem for another time.<br />
<br />
Troy turned his head back to the video and continued editing.<br />
<br />
“Would you stand on the X please?”<br />
<br />
John was hyper; he arched his back and howled, letting his primal urge loose. The yell echoed on the walls of the house. Troy hoped that Clint wouldn’t have heard. That man knew something was wrong. <br />
<br />
“Alright, time’s up wolfman. We’re going to do a different change now, alright?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, yea yea yea, YES!” John jumped so high that he left the view of the camera.<br />
<br />
“Half.”<br />
<br />
John returned back to human form. His fur had receded back entirely, leaving him only with his light dusting of body hair. Troy could see the shimmer of cum from John’s first jackoff when he first changed into a wolf now on his skin rather than fur. His claws shook as they retracted back into fingers. His large muzzle, dripping with saliva as his tongue lay outside of it, slowly reshaped back to his natural face. His skin was blemished from sunburn and various addictions. Not to mention a scar on his one cheek that Troy never bothered to ask about. With his old hands, John bid farewell to his canine cock with one more round of wacking as the sheath disappeared and the normal penis reformed. John was back at the wolf was gone.<br />
<br />
Troy wondered if he should bother editing the footage anyway. It might be too graphic and scare away normal people. The less Johns he worked with the better.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh, that was good. Do it again, I wanna change again!”<br />
<br />
“Alright John, Shape.” Troy pointed.<br />
<br />
John wobbled slightly, feeling the heat rising in his body. He began to scratch as his sides violently.<br />
<br />
“There’s something here! There’s something here!”<br />
<br />
He continued to scratch until from his skin emerged thin black stubs. He moaned as he pulled on them, stretching them out with each tug. The appendages quivered and squirmed as John smiled wide grin.<br />
<br />
“I can feel them Troy, oh yea I can. Watch me move them!”<br />
<br />
The black legs moved as at his command as he relished in the joy of his body. The legs were rough, hard, and bent slightly. They were almost spikey, splitting off at various points creating hard edges. The most notable thing about them was that they were small compared to the rest of John. Tiny. From his sides the blackness spread, changing John’s skin from its soft texture to a hard exterior shell. The darkness continued to grow up his body to his shoulders and down to his original legs.<br />
<br />
John began to shrink, his body quickly losing mass.<br />
<br />
“Oh god, I wish I were in my clothes. I wish I could shrink out of them.”<br />
<br />
He began to use his arms to jack off his cock once again. He laid down on his back, exposing his soft stomach to the camera. At this point in the video, Troy had shifted the camera downwards to get a better angle of the action. John continued to masturbate but found it difficult to continue as his arms gradually lost their reach. His arms were infected from the spread of the black shell and became rigid. His fingers melted as his hands became hard nubs of shell. They were no longer arms and hands, but instead no legs in which he would crawl on.<br />
<br />
“No,” John screamed. “I’m not finished yet. I still need my hands! Troy help me finish!”<br />
<br />
Troy didn’t move.<br />
<br />
John writhed, trying to lift himself off his back. He couldn’t. He writhed, shrinking down deeper into the white background. His legs went next as they we transformed just like the others before him. His legs began to merge with his butt, leaving little space between the two. His butt then extended upwards, becoming more compact with his torso. His penis, which at this point remained unchanged, grew black and square. A compartment formed like a sheath to hold his cock, however John’s erection continued as he thrust it forward into the air.<br />
<br />
John’s neck disappeared, becoming attached to his upper torso. His head was left to wiggle slightly was he moaned in delight. His skull misshaped as his eyes moved lower on his body and a horn grew from their place. The horn extended out lengthening like a pole. His eyes darkened as John mumbled a few final incomprehensible words. The Japanese horned beetle flipped onto its back and stretched its head to look at its surroundings.<br />
<br />
“Control.” The video ended.<br />
<br />
It was a good sale, made Troy a hefty profit. The buyer arrived in a prompt manner taking the beetle off Troy. When Troy asked what was to be done with it the man answered firmly.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to chloroform gas it and then preserve it in a museum.”<br />
<br />
He was glad he chose a psycho criminal to die rather than someone like Brandon. He might not have been able to make that first sale if he knew that Brandon would die.<br />
<br />
Troy edited out the sound for the most part, keeping some chittering noises in that Brandon made. He would use both the wolfman and the insect TF as advertisements.<br />
<br />
Troy heard the barking of Dustin outside. As he got up to let the dog in, he saw bright lights flashing from his window. They were coming from next door over at Clint’s house. As he inspected closer, he noticed Clint outside speaking to a group of men in uniform. Police officers, Clint was speaking to the police! Troy could feel panic begin rise in his stomach. <br />
<br />
He didn’t think they would be here so fast! Did he have any incriminating evidence on him? Did he have to turn all of those policemen into animals? Troy’s head spun as he wasn’t sure what to do at all. <br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
Wait, shouldn’t he just be calm? No one would believe Clint when he told them about a tiger. He might have a few suspicious people over, but that was all. Nothing against the law.<br />
<br />
Then he watched as Clint pulled out his iPad and started playing a shaky phone recording of Troy handing off the tiger to the company. His palms began to sweat. When the man handed over the check, Troy gulped. This…could be incriminating enough to warrant an investigation. <br />
<br />
Troy wasn’t sure if he’d left an errant strand of fur somewhere or left his victim’s seed splattered on the carpet, but he was pretty sure a black light would make his house light up.<br />
<br />
“First, let’s deal with Clint,” Troy whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
Troy grabbed the Book and saw Clint nodding, pulling up his e-mail. From what Troy could infer, the officer wanted him to send the video to him as an attachment. He had to shape him now!<br />
<br />
“Shape!”<br />
<br />
Clint suddenly stopped talking and had a blank stare on his face, iPad flickering out of existence. Troy blinked, wondering if he was seeing things. Clint stood there silently for a few moments not moving. Then, one of the police officers began to pet Clint behind his ears. As the officer pet ears that were slowly lengthening and growing hairy and tubular, Clint grew more hair across his face. Thick brown hair began to run down Clint’s neck and spine until he appeared to have a mane. The officer pet Clint’s mouth, pulling it out further with each pass. Clint now had a growing muzzle, and the officer was helping him get it! <br />
<br />
What the fuck was happening?<br />
<br />
Clint face by this point had extended into full a muzzle. His ears slopped back and flicked when touched. He was beginning to look like a horse. Clint got down on the ground, holding himself up by his hands and legs. One officer pulled out from his pocket a leather bridle and bit and placed it in Clint’s mouth. From there, the officer attached some leather reins and mounted Clint.<br />
<br />
His neigh-bor’s changes rapidly sped up from this point. His body, although well muscled for his age, struggled to hold up the weight of the officer. As the officer sat, Clint’s body grew in size. Muscles pressed against his clothes, pushing them to their breaking point. Before they could rip, they instead shifted before Troy’s eyes into a saddle. This saddle read in bright letters “POLICE”. Clint was becoming a police horse!<br />
<br />
Troy struggled to make out more features from the distance he was at. He swore he could see Clint’s hands pull into themselves, hardening into powerful black hooves. Troy wondered if those hooves came with their own protective iron padding. Clint’s body rose into the air as his size increased dramatically. He was originally quite low to the ground, but now his head was just about the height to the other officers standing nearby. His back became well defined and muscled, suitable for carrying heavy loads. By now fur had covered almost all of Clint’s body, with very little skin exposed left. A long hairy tail flicked behind covering Clint’s large ass.<br />
<br />
Clint’s changes didn’t stop there. Troy could see the horse growing in his undercarriage. Clint’s penis, which was originally small, began to grow and discolor. The length ran along his belly as the transformation seemed to make him quite horny. The tip of the cock flattened out, leaving a rather large horse cock.<br />
<br />
The transformation was finished, and the officers began to walk away from the house. Troy was stunned, he still had no clue what just happened or why the Clint became a police horse. New memories in his mind began to take hold. He never had a neighbor Clint, the house next to him was always empty. Troy saw a force sale sign appear in the front yard of the empty home; it had been there for years. Troy shock his head. What were these new memories! Had he unintentionally written Clint out of existence?<br />
<br />
He eyed the police officers as they walked away from Clint’s house. They were now coming towards his door! Troy needed help; he needed anyone! Dustin, Dustin would help him! He ran to a window facing the backyard, where he’d left the dog. Angry or not, Troy had no choice.<br />
<br />
“Shape!”<br />
<br />
Dustin stopped dead in his tracks. He held up a paw in front of his muzzle as suddenly it lost its fur. Fingers began to grow back, and his nails receded. The changes spread rapidly as Troy willed them to. Dustin’s back arched and he began to stand on two legs. For a moment he looked like a half dog man; his head still looking like a dog while his lower half was mostly human. Dustin stood completely naked for a moment, but then clothes appeared on his body. Troy thought this was strange. Had he accidentally shifted reality again?!<br />
<br />
New memories appeared in Troy’s mind. He remembered Dustin not as just his best friend, but also as his roommate. <br />
<br />
He opened the back door. “Dustin!”<br />
<br />
Dustin turned and barked, then blinked in surprise. “What? What was that, what the hell just happened? Wait, did you turn me into a dog for real?”<br />
<br />
“Listen, Dustin, you’re going to be angry…” Troy held up a placating hand. “I, uh, made you a dog for three weeks.”<br />
<br />
“What?!” Dustin glanced around. “Troy, I…what happened to my job? I’ve probably been fired!”<br />
<br />
“That’s not important right now!” Troy said, keeping his voice tense. “Something worse is going to happen in about three minutes.”<br />
<br />
There came a knock on his door. Troy glanced behind him.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” Dustin asked, crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
“The police, Dustin.” Troy swallowed. “I…may have done a few bad things.”<br />
<br />
“Explain.” Dustin growled. “Quickly.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, so, like, remember when we were discussing what we would do if we had a Book that was magic and we’d turn people into animals and sell them?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Dustin’s eyes widened. “You didn’t!”<br />
<br />
“I did, yeah.” Troy licked his lips. “But, like I followed your directions!”<br />
<br />
There was another, louder knock. Troy turned to answer it.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Don’t answer the door! Get out here and toss me that Frisbee.” Dustin said, voice low.<br />
<br />
“This is no time for games, Dustin, the police are knocking, I have to answer the door.”<br />
<br />
“No, you don’t.” Dustin replied. “Don’t you know anything? They can’t enter your house without a warrant. Now tell me, what exactly do they have?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, Clint was showing them a video of me getting a check for a tiger.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, slightly incriminating, but they have no clue why you had the tiger. Anything else?”<br />
<br />
”Uh, just people coming in and animals coming out.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, so we just have a nosy neighbor.” Dustin caught the Frisbee and threw it back to Troy.<br />
<br />
“I turned Clint into a police horse three minutes ago. We don’t have a neighbor anymore.” Troy threw back the Frisbee.<br />
<br />
Dustin missed the Frisbee. “You...what!?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, chill, so I cast it through the window and Clint kinda…stopped ever being human. They treated him like a normal horse, like he’d always been that way.” Troy shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” A voice called over their fence.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Dustin replied, glancing at Troy and putting his finger to his lips.<br />
<br />
A policeman was watching them over the fence, astride Clint. Dustin glanced from the horse to Troy and looked straight into the officer’s eyes. Troy just stared at Clint, more than a little unnerved.<br />
<br />
“You boys don’t happen to have any tigers running around here, do ya?” The officer asked, chuckling.<br />
<br />
“A tiger?” Dustin paused and looked around their relatively empty backyard. “Uh, no. Sorry officer.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you boys see a white tiger, you let us know.” The officer tipped his hat and clicked his mouth, boots digging into Clint’s massive sides.<br />
<br />
The horse backed away, no sign at all that it had ever been human. Dustin and Troy watched the officers get back into their squad cars and drive off. Dustin turned to Troy.<br />
<br />
“You are in deep shit! I wanna know everything!” Dustin growled, his ears twitching, which was a weird muscle movement for a human.<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. “Okay, come inside. You probably aren’t going to like this.”<br />
<br />
The two roommates went inside their apartment and sat on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Okay, so…” Troy began.</p>
