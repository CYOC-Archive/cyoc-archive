<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well” Eric started, blushing as the ideas of what he wanted to do with his new boyfriend came flooding in, “I suppose we could start fooling around and see where that gets us. You know, unless you had any ideas yourself.”<br />
<br />
Liam sat for a moment on top of Eric’s waist, enjoying the feeling of his boyfriend’s hard member throbbing beneath him while he thought back to the images he saw on the computer. He remembered that much of the boy on boy action was what could either be considered alpha/beta or dom/sub. In essence, it was a larger and stronger boy having his way with a smaller and more feminine boy. Remembering the kiss from a few moments ago, Liam concluded that he was definitely the bigger and stronger boy in the current picture.<br />
<br />
“I think I might have an idea to make this experience closer to what I saw on your computer, but it’s going to require a few little edits for you” Liam finished trying to sound hopeful. Eric arched his brow questioningly and waiting for Liam to continue, which he did when he caught the que. “The pictures of the boys, well, there’s a definite theme of a more alpha boy taking a more beta or fem boy. Between us I think we could agree that I’m a little more alpha right now…so would you mind becoming a little less?”<br />
<br />
“I thought you said you had a thing for guys like Liam Hemsworth or Liam Payne?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I still do” Liam started again “but this change has got me thinking that if I’m going to try out your fantasy, and try expressing myself as the top, then maybe we could push things just a little further with some minor changes. I mean, I’m not asking to turn you into a girl like earlier. But you know, think about it. If you don’t want to go that far, we don’t have to.”<br />
<br />
Eric wasn’t sure what to make of Liam suggestion. Liam had made several references to all the porn he had on his computer, but Eric had never made mention that he fantasied about being the dominant one over a smaller boy. However, as things stood right now, his girlfriend had committed to being his boyfriend for the sake of his fantasy and Liam was in fact the larger and more dominate of the two now. Maybe it was time for Eric to try something new as well, in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
“Okay, you can make your changes, but nothing too radical, okay?”<br />
<br />
Liam gave a large smile and kissed Eric before hoping off him and the bed. “I promise I will keep you as you, just with the right changes. Oh, and maybe we should both get undressed. I know we’ll both want to see what the small changes look like, and then we can start the fun!” With that, Liam sat down in the computer chair and began typing and click away at the machine.<br />
<br />
The typing coming from the Chronivac sounded like more than small changes, but Eric decided to trust in his former girlfriend, now boyfriend, and started undressing. Just as Eric finished undressing and taking a spot before his full-length mirror, the sounds stopped and Liam looked up from the screen. “Well, I’ll be getting undressed now, but you keep your eyes on that mirror. I wouldn’t want you to miss any of the small details.” Suddenly there was one last click as Liam’s finger hit the last enter button.<br />
<br />
Eric turned his focus to the mirror so he could spot the changes. There was a tingle that went through his body that told him things were starting to shift, but he found himself looking at his hair for the first noticeable change. Eric had always kept his hair a little shaggy compared to most guys, but now it was getting even longer. He reached his hand up to feel his growing locks and was surprised to find his hair was now softer and cleaner that it has been. Looking back to the mirror he watched as his hair reached a length that would be barely acceptable as either a boy or a girl’s cut, but it’s shine and style lent itself to looking more fem.<br />
<br />
Eric felt the tingle cease from his hair and intensify on his face. There weren’t any big changes he could see, but there were changes. His skin was now clear, free of any oils or dirty, with a soft look that lacked any sign of male facial hair. His face, while still looking like himself, now had slightly higher cheek bones, a softer jaw line, and slightly puffier lips. It wasn’t a girl’s face, but maybe with the right make-up it could be. Allowing his focus to take in his whole head, he now had a very androgynous look that leaned fem. However, his focus shifted as the tingle moved down.<br />
<br />
Eric’s eyes followed the tingle as it raced down his neck, sliming it a little and shrinking his Adam’s apple to the point that it was barely noticeable. Next his shoulders seem to drop a little, becoming a less broad and with more of a girlish slope. His arms thinned, loosing mass and becoming dainty. He looked to his hands which became a little smaller, and his nails found themselves manicured with a simple clear coat of polish.<br />
<br />
Next he felt the tingle across his chest. Just like his face, his body’s skin was becoming clean and soft, losing any trace of male body hair. His pecs and stomach seemed to flatten out and pull down like a V towards his hips. He felt the tingle briefly concentrate around his nipples, which grew just enough to seem larger and puffier while still appearing as those belonging to a male. As his stomach finished its slight reshaping, Eric’s treasure trail began to vanish, bringing his vision lower to where other changes began to occur.<br />
<br />
Eric had a little trouble on picking what to focus on with his nether region as it seemed everything wanted to change at once. His hips and butt seemed to grow into a larger and softer look, and this combined with his upper body gave him a vague hourglass figure. As for the disappearing treasure trail, the hair remove did not stop once it got to his pubic area. He watched in amazement as all the hair vanished, leaving his penis and accompanying balls smooth and fresh. Upon closer inspection, Eric noticed that his member appeared just a little smaller, and maybe a little more feminine if possible.<br />
<br />
Quickly though, Eric’s attention shifted to his legs. The hair removal moved at rapid pace, racing towards his feet. He watched as his thighs thickened just slightly while his calves smoothed and stretched into something more girlish. His feet shrunk, the same as his hands, ending this pedicured toes covered in the same clear coat as his finger nails. Eric assumed that was the end of the noticeable changes until looking up revealed to him that his 5’10” stature had been reduced by a couple of inches, possibly down to 5’5” or 5’4”.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow” were the word that escaped his lips before Eric slapped his mouth closed with a hand. The voice that had come out was nearly stripped of puberty. It was a young, boyish voice with a feminine inflection that sounded alien compared to the light bass he had been growing into over the last 2 years. Looking back from the mirror, Eric saw himself. He was smaller, smoother, and androgynous enough to pass for a girl if he put a little effort into crossdressing, but he was still distinctly himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow indeed” the voice behind Eric announced as a naked Liam came into view of the mirror. Eric quickly turned around to face his boyfriend, unaware of the instant blush that painted his face as his eyes dropped to Liam’s very erect 7” hard-on. “You know, maybe it was the Lisa part of my brain still influencing me heavily, but I think as Liam I could find this way hotter than those Hollywood studs.” Liam finished his thought by wrapping his hands around Eric’s petite waist.<br />
<br />
“You know, if you pushed things anymore into the realm of girlishness, I would think you were going back on your promise on not turning me into a girl” Eric pouted.<br />
<br />
“Ha, well the thought had crossed my mind to mess with you, but I figure that’d be too cruel. But you did turn out real cute. If you stay this way I might have you cross dress for a date or two” Liam joked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah, make your comments. At least these are all of the changes for now.”<br />
<br />
“Well, all the changes you can see at least” Liam said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“What else did you do?” Eric asked with a strong hint of annoyance that sounded much like a girl scolding her boyfriend for some wrong doing.<br />
<br />
“Nothing too extreme, but two things I felt were necessary for us to have a better time. He’s the first one” Liam said his hand reached around to Eric’s backside and easily sunk a finger into his anus. A gasp followed by a girlish moan flowed from Eric as an intense yet pleasurable sensation rippled through him. “You see, reading a lot of the guy on guy stories you had save, I became familiar with the term boy pussy” Liam explained. “I decided to take that term and make something real. You’ll find your butt is far more vagina like, and your prostate should act a bit like a clit.”<br />
<br />
Making his point, Liam moved his finger and pressed gently against the gland. Eric quickly wrapped his arms around Liam’s neck as a means to stop himself from falling as his legs gave out from the shear ecstasy from his ass being fingered. Liam, taking the clue to catch his now smaller boyfriend, cradled Eric into a hug, and continued his explanation. “You’ll find that you will self-lubricate now, and going to the bathroom is going to be very clean. No more toilet paper or wiping anything because you’ll always be clean back there.”<br />
<br />
After taking a moment to catch his breath, Eric asked “so what was the other change I can’t see?”<br />
<br />
“Let me answer that with another question. What do you remember about sex in your life up till now?”<br />
<br />
Eric thought about the question for a minute and was surprised to find that his memories had been altered. Every past experience he could remember about sex were all now with boys. He was still bisexual, but now he was a bisexual boy who never tried anything with girls instead of a bisexual boy who never tried anything with boys. “So you changed my memories about sex stuff. Why do that?”<br />
<br />
“Because, now you can experience being with a boy, as a boy who knows how to please a boy. There’s no learning curve on how to do anything.” Liam then lifted Eric’s chin so he could look him in the eyes. “You see, before you were a guy who pleased your girlfriend. But now, now you are a boy whose about to please his boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Liam pulled Eric in for another kiss, gently sliding his tongue in and asserting himself more over his now feminine boyfriend. When the kiss finally broke, Liam only had one question. “So, where do you want to start?”<br />
<br />
The question for Eric was more difficult than it should have been, but there was so much stimulating him at the moment. Part of him just wanted to back to kissing his boyfriend. Part of him wanted Liam to start fingering his boy pussy again. And the last part of him wanted to take Liam’s warm cock from resting against his stomach and lovingly pull it into his hungry mouth…</p>
