<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry and Drew ultimately decided to return to their studies, but log whatever happened by the end of their session, and see if they looked any different from how they did at the start. To aid in this, they took some pictures of themselves on their phones for the sake of comparison. Terry did admit that he was feeling pretty unreasonably warm while he thought about the changes, admitting to himself that, so far at least, he and Brad had reaped some rewards from whatever was going on. And Drew definitely had. Terry in as far as he was bisexual usually preferred women, but today it seemed he was finding his kink fulfilled - that being, guys as muscular and capable as he was.<br />
<br />
While Drew was not quite at his level yet, the amount of muscle and the way Drew&#39;s face seemed to be slightly more well formed and handsome was definitely appealing to him. Quite a few times, Terry had to remind himself that he was here to study, not make a move on his tutor.<br />
<br />
Little did either of them realize they had an audience they did not quite expect.<br />
<br />
Observing them was Steve, who was now clad in a pair of shorts, neglecting to put his shirt back on. After all, he was finally the &quot;hot brother&quot;, as far as he was concerned. Everyone always noticed Drew whenever the shirts came off. People admired his diligence in regards to his studies and his fitness routine as a gymnast. Less attention was lavished on Steve. But now, Steve felt at least he was a contender - if not the better looking brother. He&#39;d have to be blind to ALSO not notice how his face had changed. His boyish and soft features had hardened, strengthened, he looked more like an Abercrombie model in training than the nerdy guy nobody noticed.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even think, for an instant, that this might be something to do with his age. No, no, he told himself this was just him hitting a growth spurt! When Steve wanted something, as was evident here, his usual intelligence tended to fail in the face of his desires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Terry&#39;s looking more ripped than usual. Bet his girlfriend&#39;s getting quite a lot from him.&quot; Steve snickered during his lewd comment, hoping they didn&#39;t hear him. He paused, and waited - and nothing. He was all good.<br />
<br />
Steve shifted in place, shrugging his shoulders as they got slightly wider and stronger, observing as Terry complained about the heat again - and promptly took his shirt off. Oh no way, no way, Steve thought to himself as he cupped his chin, no way is that a high schooler. The strong jawline, the slight stubble at his chin and spread unevenly across Terry&#39;s jaw, the way his powerfully built muscles were coated slightly further down his stomach by light hair...<br />
<br />
No way!<br />
<br />
Steve found himself continuing to watch, chuckling to himself as he observed Drew&#39;s attention go right to Terry&#39;s body as the shirt came off. Drew - in line with the rumors - really was a bisexual. He had come out privately at home, including to Steve. Yeah it was pretty obvious what &quot;type&quot; Drew had.<br />
<br />
Steve gulped as he watched Drew take his own shirt off, and Steve felt like grumbling that it wasn&#39;t even fair. Drew looked even more jacked than usual, taller slightly, his face looking more masculine in a few ways. His back had never been THAT wide. His delts never that rounded and strong. Steve wished he could just...grow faster, not even realizing as he did this that his body was indeed growing - his chest pushing out a bit more, growing more tight and toned, his abs etching in stronger as his obliques became more visible.<br />
<br />
Steve scratched his abs and barely even realized they were there in such powerful relief, whispering to himself, &quot;Man, when I get to be that buff, I&#39;ll have all the women ready to just...go to town on me.&quot; Steve&#39;s imagination showed him an image of himself - closer to reality than he might think as his quads and glutes inflated with a bit more size and strength - and the various senior class women at the school fawning over him.<br />
<br />
His mental image got a bit more lewd still as Steven&#39;s manhood grew longer and his balls slightly heavier, filling his body with more testosterone than usual. Steve moaned under his breath, trying to keep it down, not wanting those two to notice he was there, spying on them. He tried to adjust his package, figuring his boxers were just a bit tight - not even noticing he was bigger than usual down there. Steve breathed once he got things to a more comfortable alignment.<br />
<br />
He found his eyes widening - and his cock hardening - as he watched Terry tease his brother by leaning in, making to kiss him...and then backing off. Inside the room Drew shook his head, &quot;Not even fair, Terry. Stop teasing me like that and let&#39;s focus on the tutoring. You came here to learn about biology, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, you&#39;re too excited to not tease a bit.&quot; Terry responded with a cocky smirk.<br />
<br />
And now Steve was left in a precarious position - he didn&#39;t want to leave his spot and abandon observation, but his current situation was extremely pressing. He had been left completely unprepared for his now eighteen year old body&#39;s hormones and the strength his newfound libido presented. Let alone how much more he stood to grow. With how oblivious he was to it, Steve just chalked it up to hormones acting up from any old stimulation...</p>
