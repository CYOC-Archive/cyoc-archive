<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen had gotten the call from Samantha about the picnic at around six forty PM, just as the howls from the werewolf pack&#39;s orgy began to rise from the woods near her house. In the course of getting ready and then driving to Founders Park, it was about seven o-five PM when she hugged Samantha Twist, transformed and met Martha Anderson. It was a very pleasant meeting, though a good part of her found Martha&#39;s voice to be simply delicious in every sense of the word. Its tone was naturally smart and cultured, and while there was a bit of an accent to it that Jen couldn&#39;t completely place it. It actually raised some more curiosity about the brown furred werecat seated beside her.<br />
<br />
Jen was about to ask something of Martha as Samantha and Frances finished making sure that everyone had something to eat and snack on. Admittedly it wasn&#39;t much of a dinner, but it was probably the best that could be arranged on short notice and allowing all of them to meet. Both of her old friends returned to the table opposite her and Martha Anderson  and Samantha held up a can of soda for the moment and then tapped its side to gain everyone&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; Samantha stated clearly, &quot;I know this is outside our yearly meeting and I&#39;m glad you could all be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha then glanced to the four male &quot;werecats&quot; who sat the other picnic table to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight is to let our pride&#39;s new members meet their pride face to face,&quot; Samantha continued, &quot;with picnic dinner to go with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we owe you anything for the sandwiches?&quot; Simon asked, &quot;because you surely had to go through some effort for all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... sandwiches, food, and drinks are all on us,&quot; Frances assured him, leaving out that Martha&#39;s husband had bought the sodas they were drinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;All that is needed is to share a bit about themselves and give our new members the chance to get to know everyone,&quot; Samantha continued, &quot;and while many of you may know Jen already, think of this as an opportunity to catch up with her. Let her know that she is still welcome here and that her pride will always be there for her. It will then give our new members to let you know a little more about them or update you on things that have gone on with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen inwardly smiled at that. Samantha had always struck her as a kind caring person who had all the skills to be a great leader. Over the years, it surprised her that when Samantha had updated her on things that Samantha had only become Town Chancellor, a position that was pretty much the Mayor&#39;s deputy. She&#39;d always figured that Samantha would end up Moon Lake&#39;s mayor.<br />
<br />
The others nodded and it started with Simon who stood up. He took a sip from his soda and then began to introduce himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... I&#39;m Simon Trask,&quot; Simon spoke, &quot;my form is based on the European Wildcat, grew up in Moon Lake and made good friends with Samantha, Frances, and Jen while in high school. Shortly after college, and after you and Jeff left Moon Lake, Jen, Samantha and I agreed on forming a new pride and letting things develop on their own. It worked out quite well. I&#39;ve been working as a local manager for the town&#39;s movie theater, and after Moon Lake got the internet... I found myself hooked on email and all that things that went along with it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon the nodded to Greg who had been quietly eating from a sandwich while his husband introduced himself. He quickly swallowed and stood up.<br />
<br />
Greg gave a polite wave to both Martha and Jen, &quot;Hi... my... my unmarried name was Greg Dohrmann. I was working as a hair stylist in Seattle when I made friends online with a SimonWildC69 on an instant message board. He was bright and calm and delightful with all the ideas to help make my business work better... and it did. Business-wise, I was soon running the best hair stylist shop in Seattle... but then the best of surprises came.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Bobcat based male &quot;werecat&quot; smiled to Simon and then continued, &quot;I began to fall in love with him as we talked about all sorts of personal things. We learned we were gay, and I was intrigued by his comment that he lived in a town that openly supported gays, lesbians, and transgendered people, as it was something that was commonly still hidden even then. I wanted to be in a place like that. Simon and I exchanged personal emails, not just IM message accounts and he told me about Moon Lake and he even told me about himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg glanced over to Samantha for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;m sure there is plenty for you and the mayor to worry about over that sort of thing,&quot; Greg spoke, &quot;but for Simon and I... it was wonderful... it felt natural. Simon told me about him and we met privately, both here and in Seattle. Then came a magical night... we were in Seattle... and Simon held me. He changed... he was so cute and fluffy... and I wanted it, I wanted him. I grew hard just looking into his cat like eyes and we had the most amazing sex that I&#39;d ever had. I became a Bobcat based &quot;werecat&quot; and promised I&#39;d be by Simon&#39;s side for as long as he&#39;d have me. We married and I moved to Moon Lake and became Greg Trask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus why you understood everything when I first met you,&quot; Samantha commented, to which Greg nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I now have the best hair stylist shop in Moon Lake,&quot; Greg said with a smile and said to Jen, &quot;and if you ever want your hair styled, I&#39;d be more than happy to. I&#39;d even style your fur if you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t last for long,&quot; Jen chuckled, &quot;anything you&#39;d done to my fur would be undone when I transform back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My offer is there, all the same,&quot; Greg spoke. He meant as something to offer for a late night liaison with someone, should Jen wish to impress that were, but based on what Samantha had told him on the phone, he didn&#39;t say that part out loud. He didn&#39;t want to upset a woman mourning a dead husband.<br />
<br />
With that, Greg and Simon both sat down. This time both Jose and Spencer stood up. Jose spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Jose Melto and this my husband Spencer,&quot; Jose spoke, &quot;we&#39;re both native born Moon Lake werecats... though where Spencer picked up an Ocelot totem I&#39;ll never know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you a Canada Lynx, since your family IS Hispanic,&quot; Spencer commented, &quot;though I did find that incredibly sexy and exotic. Maybe my specific totem came from all the trips to the Seattle zoo my family took. I always liked looking at the Ocelots there as they went about their enclosure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen caught some scent of arousal from the two males but said nothing. Though a part of her was feeling a bit warm already. She hadn&#39;t planned on anything of that nature and neither did she say she wanted it, because she felt she would be betraying Jeff&#39;s memory and make Tad think she was replacing his father with someone else.  But, so far, the commentary on the love that the pride&#39;s male members had talked a bit about love that struck her as almost fairy tale romances, romance that she&#39;d shared with Jeff and had given plenty of passion that she deeply cherished. It saddened her a little, but a part of her did want some of that well. To feel loved to feel that passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I met Spencer while working with my father&#39;s lawn and landscaping company for Moon Lake after College,&quot; Jose spoke, &quot;Spencer was and still is a bit of joker, but I found him playful and friendly. He hung out with me as I did my work, never got in my way, and made me smile. With that we soon began dating, but everyone in our respective pride at that time was bi. My dad was a male &quot;werecat&quot; and my mom was a werecat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine was a male &quot;werecat&quot; and my mom was a wereotter,&quot; Spencer added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love them dearly as parents... but being completely gay... some of their male/female flirtation... I couldn&#39;t stomach that,&quot; Jose commented, &quot;so when Samantha and Simon was organizing the pride... I figured that if everyone was completely gay, there would be some understanding that I wasn&#39;t going to find women attractive, particularly when at that time the pride was only two werecats and two male &quot;werecats.&quot; Now... if you want to talk to me about boys, that&#39;s perfectly fine, but I&#39;d ask that talking about girls be kept to a minimum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jen and Martha said together.<br />
<br />
Spencer than took over.<br />
<br />
&quot;My unmarried name was Spencer Treebury, but as I was starting to look for work, I was still with my parents after college and found a great deal of love with Jose,&quot; Spencer introduced himself, &quot;he laughs at my jokes and we have a lot of fun together. I did get work eventually... but it&#39;s also meant a bit of a commute for me as I drive about thirty minutes every day to run a small convenience store in a neighboring town, but I can&#39;t complain. It&#39;s let me listen to the radio and find new material to make jokes on, which Jose has always laughed at... and well... I loved him dearly for that alone. So, I married him, joined the pride and we&#39;ve both been doing well... In fact... we&#39;ve been thinking about adopting a child... giving him or her a happy home...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve only been considering it though,&quot; Jose added as the two sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll find nothing that will make you more proud,&quot; Frances commented thinking of hers and Samantha&#39;s adopted son Ben.<br />
<br />
As Spencer and Jose sat down, Jen carefully stood up and looked to the small grouping of werecats that were there. All of them looked friendly and outgoing in their own way, and from what she&#39;d heard so far, had good lives, just as Samantha and Frances had. Neither Samantha nor Frances stood up, but then she figured that she didn&#39;t need updates from them, since they had kept in fairly close touch with her after she and Jeff left Moon Lake, and since they&#39;d made mention of Martha being their neighbor, Jen guessed that Martha was already becoming good friends with them. And if from what Martha had said about herself... that&#39;d mean that Martha came to Moon Lake as a normal and that Samantha or Frances had brought her into werecat society... Jen of course didn&#39;t know that both Samantha and Frances and given Martha her dose of werecat...<br />
<br />
Jen carefully stood up and spoke to introduce herself, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve all had such happy lives. Really, I am. Everyone deserves to be with the people they love.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shed a brief tear as she thought of Jeff. She rubbed it away before it matted the fur on her face. This was supposed to be a happy occasion. She couldn&#39;t let herself go to pieces over Jeff&#39;s death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like most of you... I grew up in Moon Lake, but unlike the Twists and you... I&#39;m bisexual,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;and in the course of high school and college, I met and fell in love with the bravest and most courageous man I&#39;ll ever know. Jeff Decker. Sam, Frances, you were both there for the wedding, and Simon... I think you were just getting started at the theater then, but we didn&#39;t stay in Moon Lake. Jeff felt he owed America more than just taxes, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he wanted to be a hero. He joined the Marines shortly after we married and I found myself living the life of a Marine wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen paused as she thought over some things that related to her time with Jeff, aside from the worry over the wars he&#39;d been sent to, they were all good memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;In many ways... it became quite good, and not unlike Moon Lake&#39;s prides and packs or even the Skulk,&quot; Jen continued, &quot;they all see each other as a family, even if not related by blood.&quot; She paused to gesture to her triangular ears, claws and tail. &quot;I couldn&#39;t tell them about this, obviously, but we could share a lot. And I enjoyed at as I settled into life as a Marine wife. Jeff did a few combat tours, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, survived all of that particular mess, and was the hero... though he really didn&#39;t mention what went on over there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably for the best,&quot; Greg commented, &quot;stuff on the news did not make it pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded, &quot;True... but Jeff always remained a good man around me, and we had a son... Tad. He&#39;s all I have left that reminds me of Jeff, and he is a good kid. He&#39;ll probably have a lot to get used to as this is his first time in a place like Moon Lake, but he is a good kid. More interested in games and electronics... Might end up designing video games when he grows up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Spencer commented, &quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know at the moment,&quot; Jen admitted, &quot;I didn&#39;t need to do more than odd jobs or even some babysitting while Jeff and I were married, but now... I&#39;ll probably need to find work. I&#39;ll get some benefits as Jeff&#39;s spouse, but that won&#39;t go forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll all help where we can,&quot; Samantha assured her.<br />
<br />
And with that, Martha stood up beside Jen as Jen sat back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I am Martha Anderson,&quot; Martha said with a wave, &quot;I moved to Moon Lake from Minnesota just before the school year started to get a new start after some... some troubles in Minnesota that required a new start. Some related to actions my husband had engaged in, which I won&#39;t get into, and some related to the fact that&#39;d I&#39;d been repressing being bisexual for so long in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about that here,&quot; Jen said to her. She might be out of touch with some of the more recent events in Moon Lake, but she knew that gays, bis, and transgender were always supported in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;I made good friends with Samantha and Frances, and it was through that friendship that showed that Moon Lake gave people who weren&#39;t straight reason to hide... and in looking at Moon Lake&#39;s handbook made me more interested in werecats. Then things got interesting... one of my husband&#39;s students at the college...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Spencer said slowly and seriously, &quot;Anderson... Anderson... Your husband&#39;s the guy that the rogue clawed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blinked, this might be some of the drama that Samantha had made mention of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;My husband was clawed by the werefox Yvette Smith and became a werefox, himself. And realizing that I was gaining some interest in werecats and slowly beginning to recognize that I had been badly repressing myself around the same time. Samantha and Frances being the wonderful friends that they are, gave me my dose of werecat and I joined were society... and in many ways that&#39;s helped both of us. I got a job as a substitute teacher, and when I get my certification updated, I hope to teach full time. William as a werefox bonded to me and, and the stresses in our marriage healed far faster than I ever expected. And he is a very will built man as a werefox... and he&#39;s mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen caught a slight scent of arousal from Martha. It wasn&#39;t strong, but it was there and well within a were&#39;s libido as she was likely thinking about her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the same time, as a werecat, I became completely comfortable with being bi... and have had the opportunity to enjoy all things that relate to being bi,&quot; Martha continued.<br />
<br />
Jen watched as Martha looked to Samantha and Frances and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even if it were possible... I&#39;d NEVER go back,&quot; Martha finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, here!&quot; came a cheer from all the others, &quot;and welcome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back to Moon Lake, Jen,&quot; Simon spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you ever need to talk,&quot; Frances offered, &quot;My clinic&#39;s door is open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sat there quietly for a moment and glanced to the members of her new pride. All of them had such happy and loving lives, and while Martha had apparently had some marital problems, becoming a were had apparently solved that for her and for her husband. She was glad that they did have such happy marriages and relationships presently enjoying the love that they had. It was a love that Jen had shared with Jeff, but had lost when Jeff died. She&#39;d willingly given up a lot to take care of Tad. While they&#39;d been on the road back to Moon Lake and when she&#39;d talked earlier with Samantha she&#39;d stated that she wasn&#39;t ready, but in listening to her new pride mates talk about themselves and their loves, she felt something well up in her. She wanted the same sort of love and passion that they had, and it was a pride meeting, even if it was an unscheduled one. A part of her made the decision, to feel that passion again, as her watch read: 8:33 PM.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be fine,&quot; Jen commented, as she moved her tail to lay it over Martha&#39;s as they all finished eating, &quot;but for the moment... that can wait a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;what would you like to do now? I don&#39;t know about the boys... but Martha, Sam, and I all need to be at work tomorrow morning, so we can&#39;t stay out super late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would I like?&quot; Jen asked and gave a sigh, &quot;to be loved... to feel warm arms wrap around me and feel that warmth lead to stronger passion... that I&#39;m loved on every way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... Jen? Are you?&quot; Samantha began.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t to tear you away from Frances...&quot; Jen said to her old friend and new pride mate, and then turned to Martha, &quot;or to turn you from your husband in my favor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My marriage is actually rather open right now,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;William, my husband, won&#39;t be seeing any other women thanks to his bond to me as a werefox... but because I&#39;ve repressed being bi for so long... he... we kinda worked out an agreement to let me balance things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen reached over and took Martha&#39;s paws gently. Martha&#39;s brown fur was shorter than her own, but it was soft and did feel nice. She may have been born and raised a normal, but she had become a beautiful werecat. Jen couldn&#39;t deny that, and Martha&#39;s voice was to die for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better...&quot; Jen spoke and then sighed, &quot;still... it&#39;s not to break up any marriages. It&#39;s just to feel loved. I&#39;ve had a rather hard month concerning Jeff&#39;s death, answering a few questions as to why he was out jogging at night, seeing to his burial, getting things in order to move, taking Tad out of his school and going online to re-enroll him here at Moon Lake High, and being strong for Tad... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt Martha give her hand a squeeze and saw Samantha and Frances both get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to be loved,&quot; Martha finished<br />
<br />
Jen gave a weak smile, &quot;Yes... to feel what all of you feel...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances gave an inward sigh. It was fine if Jen was actually looking for an orgy, as she was sure that she, Samantha, and Martha could make things very passionate for her, but it also raised some red flags. While her relationship with her husband may have been strong and loving, Jeff&#39;s career had probably left her alone, particularly when he had a combat tour that Jen couldn&#39;t follow him on. Now that&#39;d be fine so long as Jeff came home and he and Jen made up for lost time, but with his murder that was impossible now, and in her grief combined with a werecat&#39;s libido, there might be issues that she had that would ultimately need more than a night of were-sex. However, she couldn&#39;t just push for that right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; Frances promised, &quot;but I&#39;d like you to come in for grief therapy... get you talk things out and so on. I&#39;m sure Tri-Care cover it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ll love me?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight, yes,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and on the condition that it won&#39;t go all night. We have work tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen watched as Frances stood up and moved to stand behind Martha while Samantha stood up with a glance to Frances and then Martha. Samantha paused between the picnic tables and looked to the four males.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be a bit busy for us at the moment... if you wish to have your own fun, that&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;but if you wish to head home... that&#39;s fine as well, as this was an unplanned meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll help clean up and head out,&quot; Simon spoke, &quot;it&#39;ll be the least we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg stood up as his husband did, &quot;It was a pleasure to meet you, Martha, Jen... Have a good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Spencer and Jose agreed, &quot;it was good to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of things being cleaned up soon rose, but Jen didn&#39;t focus on that. She only focused on the three true werecats that moved to flank her on two sides and help her up. All three were beautiful and all three had love that a part her wanted to feel. It would be good to feel that love as they slowly backed her onto a different picnic table. She climbed onto it and sat on the table top and looked to the three werecats now in front of her. She felt herself growing wet as she could see their beauty before her. Even with their clothes on, they were beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen spoke as she worked to undo her pants button.<br />
<br />
Martha, Samantha, and Frances all began to disrobe and approach her. Jen could smell their own growing arousal. That made her feel quite good about being loved and supported.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for an old friend,&quot; Samantha said calmly and began to softly nibble on Jen&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything to help set your mind at ease,&quot; Frances added and began to playfully nibble on the other side of Jen&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Martha stood quietly for a moment directly in front of Jen,  with her arms behind her back as she worked on the clasps to her bra. As the garment was removed and dropped into a pile with the rest of Martha&#39;s clothes, Jen could easily see the large brown furred breasts that the bra had supported and Martha&#39;s nipples were beginning to poke out through her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this is how Moon Lake makes new friends... I&#39;m more than willing,&quot; Martha said with a smile, &quot;are you SURE you want this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesssss...&quot; Jen moaned as Samantha and Frances finished pulling down her jeans  and panties, letting them fall to the ground beneath the picnic table that Jen was now laying on, &quot;Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Martha gave another smile and came forward while Jen spread her legs and bent her knees up.<br />
<br />
Jen breathed in deeply as she soon felt Martha&#39;s tongue run from her vagina up to her clit, which was growing wet with anticipation and with the stimulation that Samantha and Frances were giving to her, ranging from soft nibbles on her neck to calm and gentle caresses to Jen&#39;s own generous werecat bosom. In fact the three of them managed to bring Jen to orgasm quicker than she&#39;d imagined, and as Martha began to massage her inner thighs, Jen figured that while she may have repressed her bisexual side, she&#39;d likely learned quite a lot from Frances and Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh that feels sooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooood!&quot; Jen moaned out as she came.<br />
<br />
She raised her own hands to softly rub at the vulva of Samantha and Frances while they turned to kneel above Jen and began to kiss and make love to each other. Jen found both of them growing more aroused as they engaged in it. It felt good, and really made her feel more part of the pride than just the picnic. With her muzzle burred in Jen&#39;s lower lips, Martha began to massage one breast with one hand while reaching further down toward her own vagina with the other hand.<br />
<br />
The attention was wonderful and four of them were busy for a quite awhile and included various positions, including allowing each of them to taste the cream that erupted when they came. It made Jen feel loved, even though she knew that Martha would return to her husband and Frances and Samantha would remain committed to each other. But a part of her felt as though she truly needed to be loved and feel the same warmth they had with their spouses. She couldn&#39;t fully place where it came from, but she knew it was there. After awhile, Jen finally relaxed on the picnic table&#39;s top and lay flat on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better?&quot; Samantha asked from beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jen said weakly as she noticed Samantha and Martha climbing down off the table. &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha picked up her watch and looked at it, &quot;A little after ten. And as passionate and as good as that was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You three have work,&quot; Jen said with a sigh as she sat up, &quot;That&#39;s fine. I... I... I just needed to get that out of my system.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now Frances had handed her clothing that had been discarded when they started. Jen thanked her for them and began dressing herself. Moon Lake was generally pretty lax about nudity in were form, as the larger predators, werewolves, wereleopards/panthers, werelions, weretigers, werebears, and the larger herbivores, werehorses and werecattle were too big in their were forms to wear clothing, but they still drew the lines with regard to human nudity. A were HAD to be in clothes if they were in their human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s understandable,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;but... I think there are some things you&#39;re either really holding back on regarding Jeff&#39;s death or your grief is making you put a great deal more stress on yourself than is needed and definitely more than is wanted. And that combined with a were&#39;s libido isn&#39;t a good thing. It&#39;s why I&#39;d like you to come in for some consoling. You can even bring Tad if you wish... or if he tells you there is anything he feels he needs to get off his chest regarding life without his father. I can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Jen said slowly, &quot;Tad... while he&#39;s sad Jeff is gone and wishes he were here as much as I do... I think Tad has done better than I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;One never knows, people respond to death in many ways. Though whether or not he attends... at the moment is up to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded, &quot;Okay... again thank, you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Samantha assured her, &quot;anything to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances and Martha both nodded in agreement, and Jen smiled at that as she finished getting dressed again. A part of her felt quite good, and they did make her feel loved. And as she changed back into her human form to drive home, a part of her also figured that Tad was likely enjoying himself with Amy and she was just as much a were as Tad was. In that sense,  a part of her figured she had some right to enjoy a similar &quot;welcome back&quot; to Tad&#39;s welcome to Moon Lake. She put that to aside and returned to her car. She gave a wave to the Twists and Martha Anderson and climbed into her car. As she started it to head home, the car&#39;s dashboard clock read: 10:29 PM.</p>
