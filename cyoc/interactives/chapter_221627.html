<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay, Molly, this is it,” the student told herself. “Go on and practice as hard as ever.”<br />
<br />
It was the last day for Molly to study for her college exams, and the brainy redhead had been consistently preparing herself as soon as it was first announced. Molly opened the curtains to glance at the moon later, but little did she know that something would interfere with her studying. That was her were-gene. Simply put, Molly was one of those people who turned into the opposite sex whenever a full moon showed up. Cases like this end up having the person physically becoming their female or male versions during the time being, but their mind could occasionally be affected as well. Since Molly was biologically female, she would turn into a wereman during the full moon. Now to get back to the story…<br />
<br />
Molly started reading her textbook at around 6:00 pm. She studied for two hours and then took a half-hour break to eat some crackers. She subsequently got out two pieces of paper and prepared to solve equations from her textbook. Those were scientific and mathematical equations, but that didn’t mean Molly could make up her own. As you can tell, she was very determined to do well. After all, what kind of a college genius would want to disappoint their professors? Molly placed all of that on her desk and sat on her chair.<br />
<br />
“Time to deal with these practice questions,” Molly announced confidently.<br />
<br />
Thus, she started to work out equations on one paper and wrote down the answer with another after writing the question numbers down. Once Molly finished the first question, two to three minutes passed by. Twilight eventually took place at 8:30 pm, and so Molly was left about halfway through for tonight. During that phase, however, Molly was a little more tired than usual, and her enthusiasm ebbed every minute as she got to the last five problems. Then the clock hits 9:00 pm.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Molly said, “the last question of the entire study guide.”<br />
<br />
The full moon was shining brightly, and this awoke Molly’s were-gene on the spot. Without warning, her hands trembled as if the temperature dropped immensely, messing up her neatly written answer. The intense pressure went around the rest of Molly’s body as it contorted.<br />
<br />
“What the?” Molly asked. “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Molly promptly stood up from her desk and moved to the closest mirror in perfect timing to watch her shoulder-length deep red hair retracting. While that took place, Molly’s nose widened, and her nostrils thickened. Her lips lost their pouty shape before letting her facial hair coat her now prominent jawline. Molly’s chin got pointy and sharp, and her forehead widened. Molly’s eyes dug deeper into her skull and turned ovular, her eyelashes shrank, and her eyebrows did the opposite. Lastly, Molly’s hair was modified into a handsome undercut.<br />
<br />
“If this is what I think it–” Molly tried to comment, but an Adam’s apple popped out from her neck mid-sentence. “Oh yeah, that confirms things.” From what she just said, Molly knew her voice was far deeper, more profound, so much so that it was enough to be considered a baritone. Realizing where this was heading, Molly stripped out all her remaining clothes, from her green uniform to her bra and panties. Molly wanted to hate this feeling and wish it would leave her alone, and yet she just couldn’t bring herself to do it.<br />
<br />
Molly watched both her hands broadening while her nails sacrificed their polish and shortened. She soon discovered that her feet had received the same treatment as her hands: becoming large, rough, and meaty enough to be virile. Muscle mass spread out from Molly’s hands and feet as her calves and forearms bulged. Hair poked out from Molly’s legs; her nearly invisible arm hair became far more prominent afterward. Whereas Molly’s bum shrank and invited subtle portions of muscle over to replace her ass’s fat, her biceps only grew with each strength forming within. Molly’s armpits had gained a decent amount of hair when she raised her now muscular arms. Looking at them, Molly let her lingering hatred transition into enjoyment. In other words, the more her transformation progressed, the more Molly thought of herself as a man rather than a woman.<br />
<br />
Molly could hear a painful *SNAP* as her hips narrowed and her waist widened, consequently removing her feminine curves. Meanwhile, Molly’s shoulders extended to adjust her arms. Alongside that, Molly’s spine lengthened her height to around six feet and three inches tall. Molly felt a warm sensation inside her tummy, and she quickly figured out why based on her previous changes. She was earning a powerful six-pack stomach. Naturally, Molly’s B-cup tits started receding to her chest so that they would ultimately reform as hard pectorals. Molly’s nipples shrank and darkened while losing their sensitivity. All the while that occurred, hair surfaced from her new chest.<br />
<br />
And now, there was only one more part of Molly to deal with: her virgin cunt. Oh God, words couldn’t describe how wonderful this part felt! Molly happily saw her worthless vagina seal shut, but her clitoris snuck out before her pussy finished closing completely. Molly’s womb rearranged itself while her birth canals disappeared, and in no time, her prostate had formed. Her fallopian tubes plummeted and turned into her vas deferens, and Molly’s cervix promptly closed. All of those resulted in Molly’s labia drooping and transitioning into her testicles.<br />
<br />
Molly’s pubic hair thickened around her crotch, and some of it sprouted out of her scrotum. Her belly button released a hairy trail that linked it to her pubic hair. By then, Molly’s clit had already grown to four inches, but that part wasn’t over yet. Her clitoral hood spread around her enlarged six-inch clitoris while transitioning into her foreskin. During those, sperm had substituted all of Molly’s egg cells to help confirm her new gender. Finally, Molly’s clitoris, now at a marvelous eight inches, allowed room for a tip to blossom at the end, officially becoming Molly’s penis.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” Molly marveled, “I look awesome!” <br />
<br />
Molly looked awesome, indeed. While he was just pretty as a girl, he was not under the standards of being sexy. Molly’s new body, on the other hand, looked like a man from any whore’s sex dream. There wasn’t a single remnant of his once feminine body, but then Molly recalled something important.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to have to change my name,” Molly pointed out. He took a second to figure out what his new name would be. “How about Mikey?” He thought out loud. “It sounds similar to my original one, so I might as well go with it.”<br />
<br />
Just then, Mikey heard a couple of knocks on his door. He knew he already took off his clothes a few minutes ago, but he didn’t care much due to his new hormones. <br />
<br />
Maybe it’s a lady I can seduce, Mikey thought.<br />
<br />
Thus he opened the door and saw…</p>
<hr/><h3>
Who was at Mikey’s door?</h3>
