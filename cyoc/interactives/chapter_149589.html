<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, I awoke to Cheryl firmly sandwiched in between Kim and myself, and realized I was quite happy. Kim&#39;s eyes fluttered open, and she smiled at me before she ran her hands along Cheryl&#39;s skin and gave her an equally loving gaze. I realized that had I not made the wishes yesterday, and if Kim and Cheryl had remained unchanged, they probably would have been in a long-term relationship devoid of any man. There was the barest moment of guilt before my inner wolf reasserted itself and my own selfish desires took hold again. This was better. I could protect Kim better than anyone else, and we were truly meant to be together. We&#39;d known each other literally for every moment we&#39;d drawn breath; we&#39;d known each other since before we were born. But Cheryl clearly held a special place for Kim, and my interference in the laws of reality had the potential to change that completely, unless I did something about it. I silently wished that Cheryl would stay asleep for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; I asked Kim.<br />
She nodded and blushed slightly. &quot;I do. She was my first lesbian experience..she knew I was bi before I did. Not that..not that I don&#39;t love you,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I mean..fuck..Joey, I&#39;ve always loved you. I&#39;ve loved you deeply, as only a twin can love their twin. And..&quot; she brushed a stray hair out of her face, &quot;This past day isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve thought about fucking you, if I&#39;m being honest. You can be impulsive sometimes, and..I&#39;ve worried about you...and what sort of girl you might end up with. The wrong sort. I..I&#39;m very grateful that you turned me, because now..that&#39;s not really an issue. But yeah..Cheryl&#39;s second only to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s sudden confession startled me a bit, but more importantly, it made some of those inner thoughts that had been nagging at me feel, well..*right*.  The incest aspect ceased to bother me at all. Kim was indeed the perfect woman for me. &quot;I love you too, Kim..&quot; I said, leaning over and giving her a soft kiss as Cheryl snoozed between us, mumbling in her sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it bug you at all that I had sex with Cheryl?&quot; I asked. &quot;Be honest with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim shook her head. &quot;Not at all, actually,&quot; she replied. &quot;It&#39;s natural for us to share things..even people. And if the most important man in my life can be close and intimate in the life of the most important woman to me, I can&#39;t think of anything more perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Cheryl again, and felt the stirrings of a deeper attraction, borne not only from the primal horniness of the wolf, and the arousal of my first three way, but because of what she meant to Kim. I silently wished for Cheryl to start to wake up, and as she sleepily opened her eyes, she turned to Kim and gave her a long kiss, and then to me, doing the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...&quot; she said with a little sigh, &quot;Morning guys..&quot; She sat up sleepily, rubbing her eyes a bit. &quot;Was..umm..ALL of that real, or was I just wasted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can smell us. You know the truth,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Cheryl inhaled deeply and smiled. &quot;Awesome.&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck in a slightly nervous gesture. &quot;I was a little worried I&#39;d just imagined all of it because of how wasted I was.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Kim said, &quot;You&#39;re a werewolf now. Welcome to the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How big is this pack?&quot; Cheryl asked, causing Kim to pause and look at me expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the three of us,&quot; I told her. &quot;You were our first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much of a pack,&quot; Cheryl said, and I realized that my wish from the night before was most certainly still in effect. She would speak her mind honestly and think nothing of it. &quot;We need to turn more people, so that our pack gets bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could see the barest hint of worry on Kim&#39;s face. That fear that now Cheryl had been turned, she wouldn&#39;t stay close to Kim. &quot;I wish that you&#39;d make sure that one of us was there before you did anything drastic,&quot; I said. I needed to assert at least a little dominance here, I realized. I made a quick, silent wish that my next words would be true. &quot;You can&#39;t change on your own without us anyway, aside from when the moon&#39;s full. Nobody we turn or anyone THEY turn can control it the way we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheryl nodded, though she gave a theatrical pout. &quot;That&#39;s not very fair,&quot; she said, not knowing that I could have easily given her the same level of power that we had. <br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing to have to be with us,&quot; Kim said, and it was obvious that she was on the verge of having some very hurt feelings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, hun..&quot; Cheryl said, immediately reaching out to grab Kim&#39;s hand. &quot;It&#39;s not like that.&quot; Kim sighed heavily. I had to make this right. I didn&#39;t care about free will; I didn&#39;t care about morality or what was right or wrong. I *had* to fix this. Nothing could be allowed to hurt Kim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you&#39;d be ours,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Cheryl let out a tiny gasp. &quot;I..I was just getting around to saying that I loved Kim and kind of figured that she&#39;d always be with me anyway..&quot; she smiled softly, reaching out to take my hand with her other free one, &quot;But..if I can get you in the deal too, I&#39;m good with that.&quot;<br />
She leaned over to Kim and planted a long kiss on her lips. &quot;I love you, Kimberly..&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s features lit up, and she pressed into the kiss with deep enthusiasm. &quot;I..I love you too, Cheryl..&quot; Kim blushed hard, &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to say that awhile now..&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheryl turned to me, staring at me as she kissed me deeply as well, though with a bit less passion and intensity. &quot;I don&#39;t love you,&quot; she told me in a very matter-of-fact way, &quot;That would be kind of weird. We only just met.&quot; I nodded, understanding that she was certainly correct. &quot;But,&quot; she said, smiling as she gave me a second light peck on the lips, &quot;I look forward to letting myself fall in love with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The three of us snuggled tightly together again, and Cheryl added, &quot;Together, the three of us can literally change the world.&quot;<br />
She had no idea how right she was, and for a second, I thought about doing just that. With a single wish from this incredibly powerful ring, I could make every man, woman, and child into a werewolf. But the reality was that wouldn&#39;t be fun. When I&#39;d made my wish, I&#39;d tied sex and arousal and pleasure to the condition, simply due to my subconscious and fantasies.  It would be wrong to make children experience that. I might be many things, and one of them might be perverse, but some things were WRONG.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching people experience the transformation, the dawning of their own werewolf side held a sexual thrill all its own for me. So no, I didn&#39;t wish the world to simply become werewolves. We could do that all on our own. I knew that once we&#39;d turned enough people, the condition would spread exponentially. We had one week until the full moon would force us and anyone we&#39;d turned in that time to change. And again, due to my subconscious vision of werewolves when I made the wish, I knew that none of us would have control in the full moon&#39;s light. Some people would die, and that was fine too. It was the order of things. Still, I wanted to make sure of at least one bit of Cheryl&#39;s behavior remained in check, even during the full moon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It kind of goes without saying, but I wish mine was the only cock you&#39;d ever willingly take again,&quot; I said, feeling a dominant surge. She was ours, and I wasn&#39;t willing to share with any man under any circumstance.<br />
<br />
Cheryl nodded without a moment&#39;s hesitation. &quot;Of course,&quot; she said, licking her lips and glancing down the bed toward my covered crotch. &quot;Though I hope you don&#39;t mind me tasting other women and letting them taste me,&quot; she added, looking at both of us.<br />
<br />
Kim shook her head. &quot;Not at all...so long as you&#39;re ours at the end of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheryl grinned. &quot;I hope that at least one of you is there tasting them with me. Like I said, together the three of us can change the world.&quot; she nuzzled Kim, kissing her neck and turning her head for a kiss as she tugged lightly on my hand, pulling my arm and draping it over Kim&#39;s shoulder, causing the three of us to press together tightly. &quot;Together being the key word here.&quot;</p>
