<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now, now, don't concern yourself with what I'm up to; it's a surprise anyway, otherwise there'd be a mirror for you to watch the changes.&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
Alex grunted as he grew taller still.  He leveled out somewhere at six and a half feet but Ty wasn't finished.  Alex's arms, legs and neck grew thick with natural muscle.  Ty also aged Alex a few years so that he was in his mid twenties.  He wasn't a gym toned specimen, but looked more like a man who worked for a living, like a man who was a dock worker or in heavy construction, he also had a nice layer of fat over his honest muscle; the way men who enjoy their beer look.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at Alex's face and decide some changes were in order there too; he started with his eye color.  Alex would definitely look better with steel-grey blue eyes, an uncommon color but one that would be perfect for what Alex was to become.  Dark blue with grey tones that spoke of denim and storm clouds that made mighty thunder.<br />
<br />
Next Ty strengthened Alex's chin from a somewhat weak to a near lantern jawed look.  He changed the young man's nose.  It was somewhat larger and a bit bulbous and looked like it had been broken a couple of times, the look of a man who had taken a punch or two, but was also very used to dishing it out.  A small scar on the upper right cheek under the eye completed the bruiser image.<br />
<br />
Alex said, &quot;Wow, this feels weird.&quot; And was shocked as his voice deepened as he spoke into a gravely baritone.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled, this Alex had a taste for Jack Daniels and good cigars and his voice reflected that.<br />
<br />
Alex looked him over and said, &quot;OK, close your eyes.  It's OK to touch and feel what's happening, but I don't want you to see what I'm going to do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex said, &quot;You're not gonna do nothin' bad to me, are ya?&quot; in far less educated way.  Ty wasn't making Alex stupid, indeed he'd bumped his brains up by about fifteen points.  Alex was a genius, but Ty wasn't giving him any more school knowledge than a high school senior had; street smarts were a different story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I'm not going to do bad things to you.  I'm just going to make you really hot looking and I don't want you to see before I'm done, OK.&quot;  Ty said and Alex gave him a somewhat suspicious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really Alex, if I can do all of this and wanted to do bad things to you, thinks you WON'T like, why would I even bother to ask you to close your eyes for a surprise?&quot;  Ty said and Alex chuckled in his gruff voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess yer right.  If you got that kinda power, you can pretty much do what you want and I couldn't stop ya.&quot;  Alex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so, close your eyes.&quot;  Ty said and Alex complied.<br />
<br />
Ty changed the color of Alex's hair to jet black, all body hair followed and changed to black.  Ty increased the bushiness of Alex's eyebrows and decided a long thick beard was in order.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This tickles!&quot; Alex said and rubbed at his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, no peeking or I might just have to take all these hot changes away!&quot;  Ty teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK, no peekin'.&quot;  Alex growled.<br />
<br />
Alex's cheeks and chin grew dark grey, but he was still baby smooth on his face and then, the beard began to sprout high on his cheeks and low on his neck to connect with his ample chest hair.<br />
<br />
Immediately Alex put his calloused, strong, hairy, meaty hands to his face and scratched and the new beard as it began to grow.  Soon he was stroking a long beard that reached down to his pectorals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot;  Alex exclaimed at last, &quot;This is one Hell of a beard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and it looks good on you too,&quot;  Ty said and with a thought it braided itself into two braids on either side of Alex's chin, &quot;but it needs something.&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
He pondered for a moment and then decided that a sliver patch on the chin would complete the look, along with a couple of touches at the temples.  Down his back, long blue-black hair grew down to Alex's butt and braided itself as his beard had.<br />
<br />
There!  Ty thought, that's the look I was after!<br />
<br />
The next thing Ty did was not obvious to any observer at first due to the thick pelt Alex now had and the overstretched clothing he wore, but it started becoming obvious as it crept down Alex's arms.  Tattoos, some elegant and elaborate and some obviously crude prison made carbon ink tattoos crept over Alex's hairy back, chest and arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, much better!&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I look yet?&quot;  Alex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not just yet.  Maybe a minute or two more and then, OK?&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awright, but I really need a smoke.&quot;  Alex said and never questioned why he said it.<br />
<br />
Ty was quite pleased, the changes were natural, as if Alex had always been this way.  Alex would barely remember that he was any different that what he was a week from now.<br />
<br />
Ty thought about Alex's teeth and how perfect and new they looked.  He changed the alignment of them so that they weren't hideous, but looked like he'd not been to the dentist very often.  He put chips here and there in them to give Alex a smile fitting of a man who hung out in bars and was familiar with an occasional brawl.  <br />
<br />
He also yellowed the teeth somewhat; a man who likes his cigars doesn't have blinding white teeth.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the clothes.  Immediately the stretched T-shirt became black and somewhat worn.  A HD Logo in orange and white blazed across Alex's barreled chest.  A simple gold earring appeared in Alex's left ear lobe and Alex winced just slightly as the ear was pierced and then instantly healed.  A worn black leather vest encrusted with rally pins appeared over the shirt.  Black leather half gloves formed over the hands that were still stroking the braided beard.<br />
<br />
Alex's jeans grew, but fit tightly over his muscular thighs and calves and accommodated the bulge in the crotch that Ty decided needed some growth.<br />
<br />
Alex reached down and felt his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awright bro!  Thanks for the bonus!&quot;  Alex said as his flaccid cock filled the front of his now grease stained jeans.<br />
<br />
Socks and well worn, square toed, engineer's boots grew over Alex's feet.  A leather head wrap with a HD logo pressed into the headband covered Alex's head and a chromed chain connected to a fat leather wallet in his back pocket completed Alex's gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Alex, you can look now!&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, little bro,&quot;  Alex said as he opened his eyes, &quot;you know only my mom calls me Alex.  Don't be so formal an' all.  I'm Al &quot;The Grizzer&quot;, you know that.&quot;  Alex said as he looked over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you change, bro, other than my dick and ball size?&quot;  The Grizzer said.<br />
<br />
Ty knew that the changes had seeped deeply into Alex's, now &quot;The Grizzer's&quot; mind and had become natural to him..<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you think hard you'll realize what I changed and if you like the way you look, you don't have to even worry about it.&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn't I like the way I look?  I'm damned fine and I know it.&quot;  The Grizzer chuckled as he reached inside of his vest pocket for a cigar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right you are.&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I gotta get on my scoot an' head on over to The Smuggler, it's half price beer night and if I don't get there preddy quick, my bros are gonna have all the beer drunk up.&quot;  The Grizzer said as he lit his cigar.  &quot;Thanks for the extra pipe downstairs, bro, I owe ya big!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Grizzer walked out the front door and got on his gleaming black and chrome hawg, put on his black helmet and started up his chopper.  <br />
<br />
He waved to Ty as he left for the bar.  Ty had done well, he'd made one Hell of a fine biker bear AND the bearish bros who were waiting for him at The Smuggler's Den, from Alex's friends.</p>
