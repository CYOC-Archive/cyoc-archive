<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elliot had to push into an unoccupied stall of a disabled toilet. Over the last couple of months he had become an expert at using toilets by this stage of his horror. His backpack was filled with clothes for such an &#39;episode&#39;. His guts were on fire, as if he had swallowed molten steel. Elliot grimaced and felt the pressure building in his guts, he knew he wouldn&#39;t expel it like bad Mexican water, it wanted to stay. His belly started to swell pushing his business shirt out of his office pants as it took up the slack in the fabric. It continued to expand, fluttering like it was filled with butterflies. The fleshy dome was no longer covered by male hair but was now hairless and growing taunt under the pressure filling the rapidly expanding womb. More buttons popped off and soon the only buttons above my belly were holding on.<br />
<br />
My male hands tried to push the weight back in, but knew it wasn&#39;t going to work. This thing was a living being attached to me, it took up space and took up food doing strange things to my body. My reflection in the mirror was still me, buzzed hair, no beard and the usual snarl on my face as I tried to delay the unstoppable. Another business shirt I would have to take to the tailors to have the buttons sewed back on. The remaining buttons were loosened and they showed my pecs. But suddenly the hair fell off and the nipples enlarged going from fleshy pink to almost a chocolate colored hue. My tie hung limply, like a flag with no breeze, to the side of fleshy dome of a belly. <br />
<br />
I cupped my growing breasts, still trying to control these changes when I knew damned well that it would work. My nipples went from puffy teen breasts, to small breasts and then enlarged as they swelled with milk to a respectable 32D cup. My female form had brown eyes and brown hair of the same color. I saw my eyes become irritated and I went blind blinking away tears as slowly I looked at changes in my face. I had gone from six one down to five ten in height, my hands had become dainty and the size ten shoes I wore felt way too big. My face was pleasant and full, kissable lips, high rosy cheeks and a mischievous smile. Which had gotten me into this mess in the first place.<br />
<br />
My cock was standing erect, like a steel pipe, but without touching it I blew a load of sticky white fluid against the door of the stall. I knew this was the man being driven out of me. The woman taking over. The now limp dick started to deflate and turn in on itself forming a vagina only the out labia remained of my cock. My hand searched the damp flatness of my groin and found that it was wet and moist but the cock I had seconds before was now only past tense. I might get it back in a few hours or maybe never. My ass hit the toilet seat, the weight of my womb filled my lap as hips flared wider and ass grew plump to take some of the strain off of my bloated and inflated body. My moans became higher in pitch as the changes ravaged my body.<br />
<br />
Someone knocked at the door, asking if everything was okay. I mumbled a &#39;go away&#39; of sorts. The door to the unisex bathroom closed. I knew that I needed to come. The hormones inside of me left me moody, sometimes I would cry, other times I would laugh, others I would blow a guy in the toilet (although that had been earlier in the pregnancy). I stuck three fingers into my clit and with my free hand tweaked my nipple, milk squirted out. Soon my orgasm took hold, like a volcano about to erupt. My hips were grinding against my fingers as I got worked up. My breathing became shallow and rapid, my pulse quickened and tits started flopping all over the place as the electric jolt of my orgasm hit me. Throwing my head back I screamed &quot;Owww fuuuucccckkkk!&quot;. Previously I was Elliot, now I was Ellen, at least psychically, as I wailed<br />
with pent up sexual energy that always followed the change.<br />
<br />
Unlike previous episodes, milk jetted from the nipple I had been squeezing. Coating my pregnant belly and the floor of the stall. I moaned even harder as my climax gripped by body,  my mouth was so wide it was like I was going to give a guy a blowjob. My hips bucked and moved against my fingers with each passing wave of orgasm. Semen, pussy juices and mothers milk were all over the floor of this unisex toilet stall. Weak kneed I slowly pulled myself up. My pants had stayed intact, I wore by belt low, so the belly could go over the top of it. But my shirt was a mess. <br />
<br />
Slowly I regained control of myself and sorted out my change of clothes the torn business shirt, pants and formal shoes went into the bag. I pulled out the most dull yoga pants, baggy top and sandals. I was now a six month pregnant woman. The necklace that rested on the valley like cleavage of my milky tits was a reminder of who I had been, how I got here and why was morphing from a normal 30 something year old man into an 18 year old pregnant woman. The figure was of a pregnant woman rendered in gold, attached to a chain. The figure was faceless, the hair however was tied back in something like a pony tail and woman was on her knees. One hand on top of the bloated belly and one hand underneath. The breasts were also bloated with milk and the nipples had been done in great details. Nipples shaped like nozzles of gas pumps, ready to feed hungry babies. <br />
<br />
The transformation into a pregnant woman was a result of Elliot needing a disguise, a very good disguise that had served her well. But there was a catch, falling pregnant while Ellen made the transformation erratic and almost impossible to terminate. Every time &quot;Ellen&quot; had gone to the clinic the change kicked in and she was Elliot. The best advice Ellen had from her friend at the museum was that the baby was causing the transformations. She was spending more and more time as Ellen as the baby grew. Each transformation was looking like it would become her permanent state, the change back to Elliot was becoming harder. Elliot was trying to get his life in order so that he could take time and turn into Ellen, get rid of this damned baby and turn back to Elliot permanently. <br />
<br />
She let her mind wonder back to the beginning...</p>
