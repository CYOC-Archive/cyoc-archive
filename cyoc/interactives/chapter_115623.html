<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she walked to class with a few minutes to spare, she could swear she could hear faint moans every time she passed a bathroom. She wrote it off to the echo from the old gym still playing in her head. As she arrived at class, she was greeted by a sight that would have alarmed her, had she not been under the effect of the curse. Every girl in the class was almost cartoonishly sexy. Every girl had a different size of massive tits, and they were in varying states of revealing clothing. A few of them were sucking on objects. And just about every boy was stealing glances. Some were outright staring. But the girls didn&#39;t mind, a few were encouraging the glances the way Jennifer had been on the bus.<br />
<br />
As she sat down, the bell rang and the teacher got down to the lesson for the day, ignoring the scene of the class. After all--this was how things were every day. Class was mostly uneventful for Jennifer. She got an itch between her boobs, and scratched it rapidly with a pencil. This caused a fun little wobble which she knew was being watched. So she started swaying back and forth ever so slightly while she was reading. She dropped her pencil and gave her neighbor a faceful of pert butt as she bent to pick it up.<br />
<br />
As she was reading, she became slightly annoyed with her boobs. &#39;As fun as these babies are, they&#39;re annoying to keep pulling out of the way so I can read. I wonder if anyone can help me?&#39; Almost to answer her prayers, the class broke into voluntary pairs to finish reading and discussing the chapter. She was lucky enough to pair with a member of the weightlifting club. He wasn&#39;t particularly muscular yet, but something about his frame drove Jennifer wild. His name was Eric, and he was the one who got a face full of ass as she picked up her pencil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, would you mind supporting me a little with your strong hands while I finish reading this for us?&quot; He looked at her quizzically. She made a lifting motion under her breasts, &quot;These girls keep getting in my way, and your strong hands look like they could help me finish reading. But I understand if you aren&#39;t into girls or something...&quot; her ploy worked. He nearly jumped out of his chair and sat directly behind her. She felt the weight lift from her back, and her vision of her desk became unobstructed. She also felt a little turned on, as her sensitive E-cup boobs were now being fondled by another student.<br />
<br />
As she began reading, a sensual tone would occasionally work its way to her lips during a passage. She began to hope he would do more than support her. Almost on cue, he began gently massaging her tits. This would normally be frowned upon, but they weren&#39;t the only couple paired off affectionately, nor were they the furthest along in their affair.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer trailed off for the third time on the same sentence, she realized that she was beyond moist. So she asked if she could be excused. The teacher only replied, &quot;Ok, you and Eric may be excused. Try not to take too long, ok?&quot; They both nodded, and made for the nearest bathroom.<br />
<br />
As she nearly exploded out of her clothes, she watched as Eric efficiently disrobed. Although he wasn&#39;t &quot;ripped&quot; he had a competent developing 6-pack, and his muscles were starting to take form. It awakened a primal thirst in Jennifer. She nearly pounced on him and started fucking him wildly. At first he was overwhelmed by this mass of tits and ass, but he wasn&#39;t a weightlifter for nothing. He leveraged his weight and re-positioned her against the counter. Her ass pressed against the cold porcelain, and flowed over the edge. She had certainly enjoyed the sex earlier, but Eric was a different beast entirely. He was nearly insatiable. She found herself alternating between her pussy and her mouth, trying to get him off. As she used her outrageously large tits to rub his cock, she began to notice the precum building up at the tip. Quickly she flipped to all fours. Eric had full leverage and finished in doggy style. A loud and sensual moan escaped her lips as her bell was rung.<br />
<br />
After they cleaned up, Eric wandered back to class. Jennifer took a little longer, a little bit of precum still in her hair. After she finished stuffing herself back into her clothes, she inspected herself in the mirror to make sure she hadn&#39;t missed anything. Staring back at her was a girl with EE-cup boobs, wearing a thin, ultra low-cut white t-shirt with a revealing bra underneath with her nipples visible through the material.<br />
<br />
Her jeans had become something that could only loosely be described as &quot;pants.&quot; but was more a thong mdae of jean straps supporting a tiny material with a zipper aligned to her vagina. In the mirror, she lifted each tit to make sure nothing was stuck in the underboob. Satisfied, she skipped back to class, ginormous tits jiggling the whole way. She noticed a few other girls in a similar state. Seeing them so joyful turned Jennifer on in a different way than any man so far that day. Her cheeks were flushed, and she could tell her pants were overflowing. Surely one of her friends could help her problem.</p>
