<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a few minutes after their shared explosions of bliss, Rachel could do little more but float on her back, basking in the afterglow of the most pleasurable experience of her life. Naomi, still rocking her trademark aviators even all the way through their tryst, did some more spider-esque maneuvering to lay chest-to-chest atop her girlfriend, leaning in for sloppy kisses that tasted of still-boiling fluids. If she hadn&#39;t been so exhausted already, the flavor and passion of their post-coital makeout might have started advancing the superwoman towards another climax - that wasn&#39;t happening, but she wasn&#39;t exactly lacking for the heat of arousal humming in her bosom.<br />
<br />
Only once her mind started to recover from the brain-shattering orgasm could Rachel start considering what they should do now. Come hell or high water, she was spending the rest of the day with Naomi, and the whole of the night if she could manage it. They were <i>definitely</i> going to have a round two, and three, and six or seven. At some point, as well, she did want to get in some actual training too, if only so that she could tell her mom they&#39;d been practicing without it being a total lie that Veronica would see right through. It also occurred to her now that they could both use a bit of a bath after that whole ordeal - supersex worked up one hell of a sweat.<br />
<br />
She knew just the place, too. &quot;How about we...&quot; she had to pause between kisses placed upon her lips, the speedster&#39;s tongue forcing its way in to sample her mouth&#39;s taste. &quot;Go get... cleaned up...&quot; She was already floating in one direction, arms now around her girlfriend&#39;s back as she got them to a more upright position. &quot;Lake Arawak... near here... cleanest... waters in... SoCal....&quot;<br />
<br />
Arms tight around Rachel&#39;s shoulders, Naomi finally paused her relentless assault on the other girl&#39;s lips in order to pull her head back, and peek over the top of her shades. &quot;Isn&#39;t that place full of some magic bullshit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel scoffed. &quot;You don&#39;t really believe all that crap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an amazonian sex goddess who can fly and shoot lightning from your tits. You&#39;re telling me magic is far-fetched?&quot; She quirked an eyebrow up. &quot;Didn&#39;t your mom know freaking Bast, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Come to think of it... given the revelations about her mother&#39;s preferences, her mother might have known Bast, <i>and</i> been the only heroine to ever have her head between those legendary glorious egyptian thighs. They had been awfully close, after all - Veronica must have been someone special to be made keeper of those fancy claws. &quot;Okay, sure, but that&#39;s like... goddess stuff. Arawak being magic is all rumors and urban legends.&quot; She smirked. &quot;Besides... Delta-V isn&#39;t scared of a little magic, is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi&#39;s eyes narrowed, but it was accompanied by a little smirk. &quot;You challenging me, Clark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Sokolov, am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, alright, if we&#39;re gonna play it that way...&quot; Rachel giggled, pleased to see that she still knew just how to push her girlfriend&#39;s buttons. She went in for another kiss, only to be left puckering up to the air as Naomi superspeed wriggled her way out of the young woman&#39;s grasp. Her relative mastery of her own powers compared to Rachel&#39;s still-bumbling grasp of her abilities was on full display as the speedster used her own girlfriend as a ramp to gain a burst of speed, rocketing off with enough momentum to reach a tree, run down it to the bottom, and tear off towards the lake.<br />
<br />
All without shoes on, too. &quot;Show-off!&quot; She shouted teasingly as she took off, her own flight proving to be considerably fast - but nowhere near as fast as Naomi. By the time she emerged from the treeline over Lake Arawak&#39;s glittering shores, Naomi was already on the pristine waters, using her speed to run circles on the actual surface of the lake. Rachel decided on a suitably dramatic entrance, positioning herself high above the center of the lake - then switching off her flight altogether, careening to the ground in a massive cannonball, the wave knocking over her speeding girlfriend.<br />
<br />
As Naomi sputtered and tried to get her bearings, swimming over rapidly to give Rachel a piece of her mind, they both couldn&#39;t help but notice something: despite being a mountain of a woman thick with powerful muscles, Rachel was more buoyant than usual. Naomi&#39;s eyes fell upon her lover&#39;s enormous rack, which was conspicuously staying on the surface - and suddenly, Rachel realized all the jokes about her mother&#39;s stonking huge tits being flotation devices hadn&#39;t actually been jokes. Okay, that was... definitely not a superpower she&#39;d been expecting, but sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just rude, hot stuff,&quot; Naomi said with a wicked grin as she gripped Rachel&#39;s chest, drawing a moan from the girl. &quot;I&#39;m gonna need some compensation.&quot; She was quickly getting said compensation by way of climbing up onto her partner, throing her legs over her shoulders and pressing a freshly-rinsed sex up to Rachel&#39;s face. The brunette hardly minded, her thoughts about getting cleaned up vanishing the moment her head was locked between a pair of legs that truly embodied the concept of thick thighs saving lives. Her tongue reached out to sample a taste - and somehow, it was even sweeter than before, like sampling nectar straight from the gods.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t occur to her, lost as she was in love and lust, that the sweetness had as much to do with the water as with how much she adored and desired Naomi. By this point, though, it wasn&#39;t as if she could stop, as the magic in the lake had already set about its work. Both girls mistook the fire that began to crawl up their bodies as nothing more than passion for one another, completely unaware that Arawak&#39;s enchantment had already set to work on reshaping both young heroines in the midst of their renewed lovemaking...</p>
