<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you have any requests?&quot; I asked Aaron.  “This is your only chance to speak up.”<br />
<br />
“Just don’t make me tiny, I guess,” he answered.  “Based upon how Quyresee looks, I’d trust your judgment.”<br />
<br />
“Very well then,” I said.  I formed a quick image in my mind and wished for him to transform into that image.  <br />
<br />
Aaron transformed from the top down.  The first change was for his very short hair to grow longer and thicker.  As his new locks cascaded down his shoulders he excitedly ran his hands through his locks.  His face altered itself into a very pleasing, attractive female face.  He now possessed big, full lips and perfect cheeks.  Nicole said, “Ooh, baby, you’re gonna be a stunner.”<br />
<br />
Aaron was about 5’8” tall and I was going to keep him at that height.  But the rest of his body was still going to alter, naturally.  His shoulders grew smaller and narrower, but not quite so obvious to the naked eye.  His arms thinned but gained a toned, fit appearance, which almost didn’t need to be said at this point.  His hands grew smaller, his fingers thinned and his fingernails grew longer.<br />
<br />
His chest swelled out and up as two new breasts grew.  He looked very happy at the sight of the two mounds of flesh steadily increasing in size.  It didn’t take long for him to start massaging them and pinching his enlarged nipples.  The changes continued down his body as his stomach flattened and his waist narrowed.  This was soon followed by his hips growing wider and his ass rounding out.<br />
<br />
Aaron’s cock shrank and disappeared within the new vaginal opening that had formed on his body.  He couldn’t help but immediately take his fingers and explore his new pussy.  As he did this his legs changed to have the same feminine, toned appearance as the rest of us women in the room.  His feet shrank to a smaller, female size as well.<br />
<br />
He was still probing his new pussy as his changes finished.  “Hey, save that virgin pussy for a nice, big cock!” Nicole shouted at him.  He immediately complied with her demand.  Nicole took a few steps towards Aaron.  I could tell that Nicole wanted to test out her new cock immediately.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, but we’re going to have to wait for that,” I said.  Nicole looked very annoyed but I assured her, “There will be plenty of time for that later, trust me on that.  It’s time for new identities for you both.”<br />
<br />
“Fire away,” said Aaron.<br />
<br />
“You will be called ‘Ronista,’” I said to the former Aaron.  I turned to Nicole and said, “You will now be called ‘Kolanas.’”<br />
<br />
“That sounds nice and tough,” said Kolanas.  “Just like me.”<br />
<br />
“There are a few more things you need to know,” I said.  I explained to them about how they needed to address me as “my goddess.”  I also advised them they couldn’t try to contact anyone they knew from before their transformations.  I’d neglected to find out if they had family, but neither of them seemed to care when I told them they couldn’t seek out people from their past.  At this point I made sure to wish that everyone outside this lab would forget about Tommy, Nicole and Aaron.  <br />
<br />
I moved onto their attires next.  Kolanas had no problem with the standard male loincloth.  He liked the fact that his gut, as he kept calling it, would be on display.  He dared me to punch him in it.  I refused, but lightly patted it instead.  It definitely was hard instead of soft.  In keeping with his theme of looking tough, he asked that his neck piece be a necklace made of the teeth of various predators.  I agreed to give him that, but I wished that the teeth would be fake.  Again, I didn’t tell him that.  I figured it would be best to let him think what he wanted.<br />
<br />
As for Ronista, she just really seemed attached to that red bra and thong set.  They still fit her very well.  I decided that she could wear that as her outfit.  I did make one alteration to the bra, however.  I made it so that it was a bit lower cut, so that while her nipples were still covered, it looked as if her breasts were about to spill out from the bra.  While her breasts weren’t as large as mine, I thought they still deserved to be shown off.  Again, I made the necessary wishes for no one to pay attention to their clothing, and for them to be able to go barefoot.  I also wished for the rest of their old clothes, including Tommy’s, to just disappear.<br />
<br />
“I know you want to try out your new bodies,” I said to Kolanas and Ronista.  “But I’d like for you to be able to do that in more comfortable surroundings.  I also want all of you to meet the rest of our group.  So let’s get out of here.”  Quyresee buttoned up her lab coat.  I also wished for all evidence of the experiment Tommy had been working on to vanish.  With that, it was back to the hotel.</p>
