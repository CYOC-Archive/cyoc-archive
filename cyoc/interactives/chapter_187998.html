<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hearing a knock, Jeff got up from the couch and opened the front door, surprised to see his friend Madison. Her long blonde hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she had on a pair of tight ripped jeans and a bright pink hoodie, with her school backpack slung over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Madison, hey,” Jeff said in greeting, trying to cover his surprise.<br />
<br />
“Hi Jeff…did you forget about our study date again, by any chance?” Madison asked with a laugh. It was typical for Jeff to make plans for them to study together only to forget shortly afterwards and be surprised when she showed up later that night.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Jeff admitted with a blush, “Anita’s over, and we’re watching the game.”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine,” Madison sighed, her face showing her disappointment as she turned to leave. Jeff felt bad about blowing his friend off, so quickly called out after her.<br />
<br />
“Wait! There’s a desk in my dad’s…err, the spare bedroom that you could study at, if you want some peace and quiet. The game should be over soon, and then I can join you, if you want.”<br />
<br />
“That’d be great! Things are crazy hectic at my house as always, and so it’s difficult for me to focus,” Madison smiled gratefully, stepping into Jeff’s home.<br />
<br />
Jeff made his way back to the living room while Madison showed herself upstairs and into the spare bedroom. The room was rather bare, with the only furnishings being a double bed and a large desk. Madison unzipped her backpack and pulled out her laptop, sitting down at the desk and getting started on her homework.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to both Madison and Jeff, Madison’s changes into the new patriarch of the family were already starting. As Madison worked away on her English Essay, her dainty feet started to expand, her smooth skin taking on a rougher, more leathery texture as dark brown hairs sprouted from her toes. The light blue socks she had been wearing darkened to navy as they grew larger to accommodate her new men’s size 12 feet. The dark brown hairs started making their way up Madison’s legs, covering her calves and thighs in a thick pelt. Her slender calves started to bulk up with both muscle and a bit of fat, Madison’s milky white skin taking on a darker complexion. Her jeans were starting to tear as Madison’s legs continued to thicken, but the material quickly darkened and expanded, shifting into a pair of dark grey khakis. <br />
<br />
Madison frowned as an upbeat pop song started playing on her laptop. Though usually this was her favourite kind of music, she found that she couldn’t stand it tonight, and quickly skipped through several songs until a rock metal song from the 80s started playing. Satisfied, she turned her attention back to working on her college essay. The hairs continued to spread up Madison’s body, leaving her with a thick bush of dark brown pubes around her pussy. Madison let out a little moan as her clit started to swell and expand, quickly forming into a hefty cock. A large pair of hairy balls dropped from Madison’s pussy before it sealed shut, her new testicles swelling with semen and causing her newly formed dick to start to harden. Madison’s pink panties quickly shifted into a pair of black boxer briefs that much better accommodated her new package.<br />
<br />
Morgan reached his hand down and started stroking his dick through his pants, thinking about how hot his younger brother Jeff’s girlfriend was. As he was rubbing his new member, Morgan’s hips narrowed while his ass grew rounder, adding a thick padding of fat. The dark hairs continued to spread up Morgan’s body, forming a thick treasure trail on his stomach. His stomach started bulging outwards into a large, round muscle gut. While Morgan was a bit on the heavy side, he still took care of his health and was in relatively good shape. Morgan’s C sized breasts were quickly dwindling down to nothing, being replaced with a set of meaty, hairy pecs. Morgan’s previously slim frame started to broaden, his shoulders expanding as muscled, veiny biceps and triceps erupted out from his slender arms. The bright pink nail polish disappeared from his hands as they grew larger, his palms growing rough and calloused. Morgan forced himself to focus on his work and ignore his boner; his boss would have his head if he didn’t finish up this file for first thing tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
Morgan’s pink sweater was extremely tight on his much larger frame, but the material quickly changed and darkened, rematerializing as a short sleeved dark purple button up shirt. A prominent Adam’s apple formed in his throat as his light blonde hair grew darker, retracting back into his scalp. His hair was now a dark brown with a few streaks of gray, thinning out and leaving a small bald spot on the top of his head. Morgan’s jaw squared out, his face taking on a more masculine appearance as his eyebrows thickened and his nose grew larger. His lips thinned out as his emerald green eyes darkened to a deep-sea blue, a few wrinkles appearing as he reached his new age. Lastly, Morgan grew a thin dark brown mustache above his lip and stubble formed along his chin, leaving him with a 5 o’clock shadow.<br />
<br />
Madison, the pretty young cheerleader, had finished her transformation into Morgan, the handsome middle-aged single father and businessman. Morgan finished up his work for the night and shut down his laptop, sliding it back into his work bag. He rose from the desk and did a quick stretch, noticing that he still had an erection. Morgan contemplated whether to quickly jerk off before going to join his son Jeff in the living room for pizza.</p>
