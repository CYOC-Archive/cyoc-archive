<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. The irony of his situation wasn’t lost on him. He was now a clone of his four-year-old brother, Brad, but with the body and mind of an adult. His new physique was muscular, his cock hard and throbbing beneath the sheets. He had always been straight, attracted to women, but since the swap, something had changed. The sight of men sent a shiver down his spine, a thrill he couldn’t ignore.<br />
<br />
He tossed off the covers and stood up, admiring his reflection in the mirror. His muscles glistened in the dim light, his abs defined, his biceps bulging. He flexed unconsciously, feeling the power in his new form. It was intoxicating, this feeling of strength and virility. He knew what he wanted, and he wasn’t going to wait any longer.<br />
<br />
David grabbed his phone and scrolled through his contacts. He hesitated for a moment, then dialed a number. It rang twice before a deep voice answered.<br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Jake. It’s David. Are you free tonight?”<br />
<br />
There was a pause on the other end, then Jake’s voice, slightly surprised, “Yeah, man. What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“I need to see you. Can you come over?”<br />
<br />
Another pause, longer this time. “Uh, sure. Give me half an hour.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Jake. See you soon.”<br />
<br />
David ended the call and paced the room, anticipation building in his chest. He stripped off his clothes, tossing them onto the floor, and wrapped a towel around his waist. He needed a shower, to wash away the nervous energy that was coursing through him. He stepped into the bathroom and turned on the water, letting it heat up before stepping under the spray.<br />
<br />
The hot water cascaded over his body, washing away the sweat and tension. He closed his eyes, imagining Jake’s strong hands on him, his mouth pressed against David’s skin. The thought made his cock twitch in response, and he groaned, leaning against the tile wall. This was going to be intense, he could feel it.<br />
<br />
After his shower, David dried off and wrapped the towel back around himself. He glanced at the clock; it had only been ten minutes. Too restless to sit still, he decided to make some coffee. He moved through the house with a newfound confidence, his hips swaying as he walked. He could feel his erection pressing against the towel, a constant reminder of what was to come.<br />
<br />
When he heard the doorbell ring, David’s heart skipped a beat. He took a deep breath and opened the door, revealing Jake standing there, looking as rugged and handsome as ever. His dark hair was tousled, and his blue eyes sparkled with curiosity.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Jake said, his gaze flicking over David’s toned body. “You look… different.”<br />
<br />
David smiled, a slow, seductive grin. “Come inside, Jake. We need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Jake followed him into the living room, his eyes never leaving David’s body. They sat down on the couch, David perched on the edge, his legs spread wide. Jake sat beside him, close enough that their thighs touched. The air between them was charged with tension, a palpable energy that neither could ignore.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, David?” Jake asked, his voice low and rough.<br />
<br />
David leaned in, his eyes locking onto Jake’s. “Something happened to me, Jake. Something… life-changing. And I need to explore it with you.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s brow furrowed, confusion mixing with arousal. “What are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not who I used to be,” David said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “I don’t know how else to explain it. But I need you to touch me, to show me what this means.”<br />
<br />
Jake swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “Are you sure about this, David?”<br />
<br />
David nodded, his eyes never wavering. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.”<br />
<br />
With a slow exhale, Jake reached out, his hand trembling slightly as it brushed against David’s thigh. The contact sent a jolt of electricity through David’s body, and he gasped, his cock straining against the fabric of the towel.<br />
<br />
“Do you like that?” Jake asked, his fingers tracing a path up David’s leg.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” David breathed, his voice thick with desire. “More than I ever thought I would.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s hand slid higher, his thumb brushing against the ridge of David’s erection. David moaned, his head falling back as Jake’s touch ignited a fire within him. He reached out, grabbing Jake’s wrist, guiding his hand to the edge of the towel.<br />
<br />
“Take it off,” David commanded, his voice husky. “I need to feel you.”<br />
<br />
Jake hesitated for only a second before pulling the towel away, exposing David’s fully erect cock. The sight of it made Jake’s breath catch in his throat, and he swallowed hard, his eyes dark with lust.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, David,” Jake whispered, his hand closing around the base of David’s shaft. “You’re huge.”<br />
<br />
David groaned, his hips bucking involuntarily as Jake began to stroke him. The sensation was overwhelming, his new body hyper-sensitive to every touch. He arched his back, his nails digging into the leather of the couch as Jake’s hand moved up and down his length.<br />
<br />
“So good,” David panted, his eyes fluttering shut. “Don’t stop.”<br />
<br />
Jake didn’t stop. He tightened his grip, his strokes becoming more deliberate, more intense. David felt waves of pleasure crashing over him, each one stronger than the last. He could feel his orgasm building, coiling tighter and tighter inside him.<br />
<br />
“I’m close,” David warned, his voice strained.<br />
<br />
Jake’s thumb grazed the tip of David’s cock, spreading pre-cum over the sensitive head. The added stimulation pushed David over the edge, and he let out a guttural cry as he came, his seed spilling over Jake’s hand and onto the couch.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, David sagged against the cushions, his body shaking with residual pleasure. Jake released his cock, wiping his hand on the towel before turning to face David.<br />
<br />
“That was… intense,” Jake said, his voice shaky.<br />
<br />
David smiled, a satisfied grin spreading across his face. “You have no idea.”<br />
<br />
Jake leaned in, his lips hovering just inches from David’s. “Can I taste you?”<br />
<br />
David’s breath hitched, his heart pounding in his chest. “Yes,” he whispered. “Please.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s tongue darted out, licking the remains of David’s orgasm from the tip of his cock. David groaned, his hips lifting off the couch as Jake’s mouth descended, engulfing him completely.<br />
<br />
The feeling of Jake’s warm, wet mouth around his cock was indescribable. David’s toes curled, his hands fisting the fabric of the couch as Jake bobbed his head, sucking and licking with expert precision.<br />
<br />
“Jake… fuck…” David moaned, his voice breaking. “Don’t stop. Please.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s hand moved in tandem with his mouth, stroking David’s shaft while his tongue worked magic on the sensitive underside. David could feel another orgasm building, this one even more powerful than the first.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna come again,” David warned, his voice trembling.<br />
<br />
Jake didn’t slow down. If anything, he sped up, his movements more frantic, more desperate. David’s vision blurred, his mind consumed by the sheer intensity of the pleasure.<br />
<br />
And then, with a final, shuddering gasp, he came again, his seed filling Jake’s mouth as wave after wave of ecstasy washed over him.</p>
