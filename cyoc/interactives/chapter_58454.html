<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I guess it wasn't long before people had begun checking out my profile.  I'd put a pic up, and I think that helped.  Soon enough, I was getting messages from a few members into what I was into.  One message in particular pulled my interest.  It was from a moderator.  Trusted member of the community.  Comments on his page were vague.  Users seemed to be secretive about his methods.  <br />
<br />
I was worried at first, but he was trusted enough... I'd respond.<br />
<br />
GroMod:  So, I see you're interested in being a bit bigger?<br />
<br />
EmBiggen: You could say that...  You've read my profile?  You do changes like that?<br />
<br />
GroMod:  Of course.  One of my favorite kinds!  A bit more muscle... thicker around the middle... a little softer?<br />
<br />
EmBiggen:  That's the one.  Always wanted to be a bit of an ex-jock.  Never was a jock to begin with though.<br />
<br />
GroMod:  Let's get this show on the road then.  Get your web-cam on, and let's get you growing, big guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I grinned to myself.  Even if it was just a bit of role-play, it sounded fun.  I flick on my webcam and wait as my image pops up in the chat.<br />
<br />
GroMod:  You're pretty cute... a bit thin for my tastes though.  How about we get that fixed.  Are you ready to join the big leagues?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready and willing!&quot;  I said sitting back and motioning to myself &quot;Show me what you got.&quot;<br />
<br />
GroMod: You asked for it...  okay, transformation enabled... here we go.  Just need to make some adjustments to your transformation info...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  I said, gulping slightly.  Part of me wondering if this could possibly happen.  GroMod was silent for a few minutes.  I was getting tense, apparently he could see it in my face.<br />
<br />
GroMod: Calm down, ha ha.  I'm done now... changes should occur in the next few seconds.  Enjoy it!<br />
<br />
<br />
With that, I felt an odd tingle, and warming sensation.  I felt prickling across my whole body.  Then, the sensation I'd expected would all be in my mind.  Swelling.  It was subtle at first.  My 160 pound body was changing... growing bit by bit.  My lean arms began to bulk up, and my chest too.  I felt the grin creep across my face as I watched clothing pulling and contorting around my muscles as they puffed bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe it!  This chat actually works?!&quot;  I shouted with a laugh as I flexed my arms a little.<br />
<br />
GroMod: Of course!  Just thought it was role-play, huh?<br />
<br />
I nodded. &quot;Yeah, glad I was wrong though!&quot;  I flexed a bit into the camera.  My muscles taut and straining my clothes.  Except the waist, which remained loose.  I lift my shirt to see abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I'm pretty defined here...  How big am I?&quot;  <br />
<br />
GroMod: 210 right now.  I started with the muscles.  Gotta let you experience the Before, before you become the After, after all.<br />
<br />
I flex a bit, grinning into the cam.  &quot;Like what you're seeing, GroMod?&quot;  <br />
<br />
GroMod: Still a bit thin for me, little man.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the tingle returned.  The smirk crept back across my face.  &quot;Here it goes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I began to inflate.  Subtle, as it had been when I muscled up. The tight, hard muscles I'd been given started to soften in appearance.  Pound after pound adding a soft, springy layer of chub on top of my beef.  The striations across my body filled in.  Harder angles softened.  Abs disappeared and bulged out as what appeared to be years of overeating were catching up with me.<br />
<br />
GroMod: I always love seeing a newbie getting bulky like this...  Your belly is looking cute, big boy.<br />
<br />
I think I actually blushed.  I kept swelling.  My shirt was pulling up, tightening around the belly and love handles growing within it.  I unbuttoned my jeans to give my new gut some breathing room.  My thighs thickened, my arms too... even my face.  It looked rounder in the web-cam image.<br />
<br />
Soon, it ended.  I stood up and surveyed what I'd become. My now stronger hands cradled my gut.  Soft, but firm.  Keeping a round shape with some nice bounce.  My thick pecs straining my shirt.  My jeans tight across the thighs and seat.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This is fantastic!  I can't believe it worked!  How big am I anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
GroMod: 260 for now.  100 pound gain, split 50 50 between muscle and fat.  You're a big burly hunk now!  Gotta say, you're even hotter than I thought you'd be.<br />
<br />
I bounced my gut with one hand and flexed my other arm at the camera. &quot;All thanks to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
GroMod:  No problem!<br />
<br />
After a moment, I thought back to something he said.  260 &quot;for now&quot;.<br />
&quot;Hey... GroMod.  What'd you mean by 260 'for now'?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause as I waited for an answer.  2 minutes that felt like an hour.<br />
<br />
GroMod:  Oh, right, I forgot to tell you. I always give TFers more than they asked for.  You wanted to experience being a once fit jock who can't keep the pounds off these days.  That's what's going to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  I said, sitting back down and getting close to the camera.<br />
<br />
GroMod: Basically, for the next week, you're going to be packing on pounds like crazy. A pound or two of muscle here and there, but for the most part, you'll be porkin' up!  When you get a chance tomorrow, you might want to go out and buy some 3XL or 4XL clothes, and stock your fridge really well.<br />
<br />
By the end of the week, you're going to be a big, fat, out of shape ex-jock.  Probably somewhere over 450.  Then you'll live that life for the next month.<br />
<br />
&quot;A...are you serious?&quot;  I said, a little pale.  &quot;People are going to notice!&quot;<br />
<br />
GroMod: Nah, no worries there.  People are going to comment though, remembering when you were a powerful, athletic guy, and wondering how you've managed to blob out the way you did.  Commenting about how you used to run a mile, but now you get out of breath waddling to the fridge.  Trust me, it's going to be fun.  At the end of the month you might not even want to go back!<br />
<br />
Your transformations are on lock down until it's complete.  So don't worry too much. Just sit back and enjoy life as a real ex-jock.  Gotta get going though.  Come see me at the end of the month!  <br />
<br />
And with that, he logged off.  I asked around, and sure enough, my transformations were on lock down.  No one could, or at least no one WOULD change me back.  I asked the admin, and he told me just to trust GroMod, and that he had nothing but happy chat partners. <br />
<br />
I logged off and looked at myself.  I was big... about to be bigger.  I'd never given thought to gaining a ton of weight, but something about the concept of this forced change was thrilling.  My cock had been hard since the changes had stopped.  I swaggered my beefy body down the hall and into the bathroom to take care of business.</p>
