<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy was just heading into her final year of secondary school, 17 years old and already highly motivated and driven. She was going to apply to study law and become a high earner with a successful career; she&#39;d been adamant in this since she was twelve years old. <br />
<br />
Her driven aims contrasted with her tiny frame: she stood at a petite 5&#39;0&#39;&#39;, maybe even less with a cute little nose, almond shaped grey eyes, and a sunny smile. Her B cup breasts were the perfect size for her slender frame, and she was secretly proud of her pert little derriere; firm, round and perfect. Long brunette hair ran down to just above it, framing her face and her bangs. Amy&#39;d get a lot more attention if she wasn&#39;t so goal-focused, she didn&#39;t socialise much at school and had a bit of reputation as a nerd and teacher&#39;s pet.<br />
<br />
However, Amy&#39;s family didn&#39;t have much money. Which is why she&#39;d been looking for a part-time job. Then she&#39;d come across one for freelance editing work, and it had seemed perfect! What she didn&#39;t know is that there&#39;d been an error in the paper and the phone numbers for two advertisements had been switched. The one she&#39;d actually phoned up had been...<br />
<br />
&#39;URGENT: LOOKING FOR WORKER TO TAKE OVER FROM RETIRING ADULT STAR<br />
Small talent management firm seeking go-getter to have head swap with adult star and star in her movies going forward. Generous cut of profits, no experience required as full on-the-job training provided. Call today!&#39;<br />
<br />
Of course, even when she&#39;d called, this hadn&#39;t come to light. Amy was so enthusiastic to find a job, and the agency frankly so excited to get an applicant, that not too many questions were asked. Not a lot of people were happy to trade bodies so a porn star could retire, while her agency still milked a few extra years of filming out of her ludicrously exaggerated body.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my prior experience really isn&#39;t a problem?&quot; Amy had asked the person on the end of the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, we&#39;ll train you on the job, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pick it right up,&quot; she&#39;d been reassured. &quot;And you said you were 17 and wanted to fit it around your studies, if you could? Well...&quot; The voice sounded unsure. &quot;Legally it&#39;s fine, the body&#39;s 24, we&#39;d have preferred someone older but we can work around your schedule. And obviously nowadays a lot of content is worked on remotely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy had been too excited and too eager to not look silly that she didn&#39;t stop to ask what they meant by the body being 24. &quot;Wait, so I&#39;ve got the job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we&#39;ve not had a lot of interest. Why don&#39;t you stop by on Saturday and we can do your induction, get you set up?&quot; She was given an address for a small office out on a local industrial park. <br />
<br />
That weekend, Amy took the bus out to the industrial park. It was fairly quiet, a couple of offices, a couple of trade suppliers, and then a small building of offices tucked into the corner beside a car park and some bins. She’d taken the time to dress respectably, in a pale blue blouse and a black pencil skirt.<br />
<br />
The elevator slid open on the floor a security guard had directed her to, showing a garish pink sign for BBI. As she rounded the corner, there was a small reception, with an attendant sitting tapping away on a laptop. He looked bored, until he looked up and spotted her with a start. “Oh! Amy?”<br />
<br />
She gave him a shy smile. “Uh, yes. Hello. I’m here for my induction with Jack?”<br />
<br />
“That’d be me. Come this way.” He led her through as he chatted. “So it’s great you’ve agreed to this, we were really struggling for applicants. You’ll be taking over from Christy Max. Have you heard of her?”<br />
<br />
“Um… I haven’t,” Amy said honestly, wondering if she’d be expected to have heard of random editors, unaware that who she hadn’t heard of here was one of the bustiest porn stars in the business. <br />
<br />
“Well, Christy’s retired, so we just need someone to keep it all going.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m very eager to get started,” Amy said as he led her into a small side room. It looked a little odd, there was what looked like a hairdresser’s chair with one of those blow dryers hanging above it. <br />
<br />
Jack chuckled. “Well, why don’t we just sign the paperwork, and get to it? It’s a little unethical to just rush it, but you seem like you’ve got a good head on your shoulders, happy just to pick it up as we go?” <br />
<br />
Amy smiled. Maybe it was a little naive, but hey, a job was a job! She just needed to get through the school year and make a bit of scratch. “Sure, sounds good.” She signed at the bottom of the contract without reading the rest. <br />
<br />
“Right, we’ll just get you sat here…” Jack helped her into the chair and lowered the headpiece down. It sunk lower than she’d expected, dropping down to her neckline as he scooped up her long hair, feeding it up into it.<br />
<br />
“Hold up, what does this have to do with a job interview?” she asked, but evidently the apparatus leaving her in the dark muffled her enough that Jack didn’t hear her. <br />
<br />
But she could hear him, and he continued. “You’ll just feel a sharp prick against your neck, and…” Amy squealed, feeling a needle slip into her. What was this? This was meant to be some kind of paperwork job! Her eyes went blurry, and before she could further protest, she felt herself slipping into unconsciousness. <br />
<br />
If she was conscious, she’d have felt the cool, clean surgical incision as her head was detached from her body, medical spray immediately stopping the flow of blood, the jar over her head sealing to keep her fresh for transport...</p>
