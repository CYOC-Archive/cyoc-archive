<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abruptly, you sit up, looking about your room, noticing the sun streaming through the curtains and glancing at the clock, you barely take in that it was about 9.27 in the morning, your attention shifting rapidly as you instead look down, taking in your hairless torso and the fact that you are not wearing a shirt. Jumping out of bed, you glance down at yourself for a moment and heading for the bathroom, you barely register that there was somebody else in the house with you, you mind on other matters.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, you shut the door and engaging the locking mechanism, you approach the mirror, taking in the reflection being cast back. After a moment, you sigh in relief that the person you are seeing was not a seven year old girl, but felt puzzled because the person being reflected back was clearly how you looked when you were about sixteen, seventeen years old.<br />
<br />
Grasping the waistline of your pyjamas, you pull them forward and looking down, you nearly crow with delight to see the familiar sight of your penis and testicles and thinking that the whole fiasco must have been some weird dream, you turn away from the mirror, lift the toilet lid and pushing your pyjama bottoms down just a bit, you sit down on the toilet to pee, unaware of what you are doing, only aware of an elated feeling as you tell yourself, &quot;It was all just a dream. One horrid dream. Because, truthfully, there is no way a person can shift sex and gender, unless they have some kind of operation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finished, you pull up your pyjama bottoms and underwear, head for the sink, still breathing a sigh of relief that what you think might have happened, might have all been nothing but a dream as you begin to wash your hands. Stepping out of the bathroom, you stop as you heard clearly, &quot;Why can you not pick up your toys, Megan. Why must you leave them scattered about,&quot; and realising that it was your mother speaking, something you think must be obvious as you look like your teenage self, you suddenly wonder about the dream as it comes to your attention that your mother was talking to somebody and that somebody was your eight year old sister, Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I never had a younger sister,&quot; you told yourself as you move down the hallway, briefly glance into what was clearly now your sister's room, feel a funny, ticklish feeling rush over you as you suddenly wanted to go in, and turning away, you head for your room.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on your bed, looking about your bedroom, you asked of yourself, &quot;It was all just a dream, wasn't it?&quot; as you attempt to remember what it exactly was that you dreamed about last night.<br />
<br />
Unable to remember, you figured in the end it was not important and that there was no way you could have become a girl and that you must have forgotten that you have a sister named Megan and it was only because you just woke up and that your brain must be sleep muddled still. Heading for your dresser, you strip off your pyjama bottoms and underwear-like boxers, and slowly begin to dress, unaware that you are coordinating the clothes you pick so that they look cute together and are appropriate for a summer fashion.<br />
<br />
Afterward, dressed in a plain white t-shirt, a pair of denim shorts and a pair of ankle-high socks, you head for the kitchen to get breakfast. On the way, passing through the living room, you noticed Megan sitting on the floor, playing with a bunch of her dolls, watching some brightly animated telly programme. Stopping for a second, you find yourself almost mesmerised by both what Megan was doing and what was being shown on the television. Blinking a couple times, you quickly move across the living room, telling yourself, &quot;Dream must be getting to me. Just forget it,&quot; as you head into the kitchen and begin to look about for something to eat.<br />
<br />
Returning from the kitchen with your bowl of cereal, you find yourself sitting down on the couch, watching as Megan played with her dolls and the animated programme being presented on the telly. As you slowly eat your breakfast, the funny, ticklish sensation slowly returned and before you could stop yourself, you looked over at your sister, noting the pink tank-top she was wearing and the floor length, light blue dress, and before you could give what you are thinking a second thought, you asked, &quot;Megan? Can I sometime borrow that outfit? It just so cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan, forgetting her dolls, slowly turned to gaze at you, a look on her face that you cannot tell if she was upset or puzzled by what you just said. Standing, you hastily exit the room before she could answer and wondering what has suddenly came over you, you finish your breakfast, rinse your dishes in the sink and tell yourself, &quot;It must be the dream. That is the only logical explanation. There is no other way to explain why I just ask Megan such a ridiculous question,&quot; and deciding that you cannot hang about the house all day, you leave your bowl and spoon in the sink and head for your room.<br />
<br />
In the back hallway, you pass Megan, who was now naked and holding her bathing suit in one hand and the outfit in the other. Seeing you, she called after you that it was okay if you wanted to wear her dress and tank-top, and mumbling, &quot;Maybe later,&quot; in response, you grab the money that you have saved up from your allowance, and rushing back out of your room, where Megan was now pulling on her bathing suit. Pushing your way passed her, figuring that the sooner you are out of this house, the better you'll be and the more likely you'll be able to forget the dream, as you head for the backdoor, where you kept your shoes.<br />
----<br />
<br />
Slowly you blink and look up at the ceiling, wondering where you are and what you have been doing. Rolling over, something making a slight crackling noise as you do so, you glance at the clock and after a bit more of blinking, you note that it was about 4.51 in the afternoon. Shifting, again the crackling noise, you blink some more as you attempt to remember what happened after you had left the house at about eleven this morning and why you suddenly awoke back in your bed.<br />
<br />
As your room comes back into focus, you notice several odd things. The first it the several piles of clothes sitting on your desk, all you notice are appropriate for a young girl. Confused, you force yourself to sit up and it was only then that it came to your attention that you were wearing a dress of a medium blue colour that came down to just above your knees and was securely fastened just below your armpits.<br />
<br />
Touching the soft blue fabric that made up the halter part of the dress, unsure how you know what it was called, you note that it was strapless, came down just a couple inches above your belly-button and after a couple times of running your hand over the soft fabric, discover that it has a hidden zipper on the right side and that something attached to the back. Inspecting the skirt portion, you see and feel a course fabric that you draw a blank on as to what it was called, covering three tiers of a soft material that was the same as the halter portion.<br />
<br />
Scared, you lift up the dress, but breathe a sigh of relief when you notice that you still have your penis and testicles, that you are clearly not wearing any girl’s underwear, and that, except for the strangeness of what you are wearing, you are still a sixteen year old male.<br />
<br />
Dropping the skirt, you see a pair of fairy wings on the floor, next to a pair of blue tights, same colour as the dress, with bright splashes of glittery objects that you for some reason to know to be stars.<br />
<br />
Blinking again, you decide to remove the dress before your mother or your sister found out, but before you could do so, you mother strolled into your room and without batting an eye as to what you are wearing, she comments, &quot;Did you enjoy your nap, honey?&quot; as she headed to your desk and began to pick up individual piles of the clothes stacked there and began to put them away in your dresser and inside your closet, adding as she does so, &quot;Megan still wants to know if you'll play with her,&quot; as you pick up the blue tights and fairy wings off the floor, attempting to remember what you did over the last couple hours and find a decent way to respond.</p>
