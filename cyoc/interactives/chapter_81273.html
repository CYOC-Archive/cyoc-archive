<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, whatever you do now, I'll remember, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can...make it un-happen if I ask, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same as your pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki shuddered.  She'd been told that she'd had a vagina, but only one person found the idea _normal_, and it <br />
wasn't her.  And even if Jessica gave her her memories back, it would be like making her a person she had <br />
retroactively never been.<br />
<br />
On the other hand...<br />
<br />
Reality was starting to set in.  Nikki had always been a girl.  She'd known that before her parents had <br />
explained that there were boys and there were girls.  And while it had taken some explaining, her parents had <br />
eventually just shrugged, and resolved that their child-with-a-penis was a girl.<br />
<br />
Middle school gym hadn't been so kind.  The world at large had accepted she was a girl with a cock, but kids <br />
were always cruel, and while some girls only got taunted about an unfortunate mole, or bad skin...<br />
<br />
A penis was a target too big to pass up.<br />
<br />
Up until she was fifteen or sixteen, she remembered being afraid.  Boys got big.  They got hairy. Their voices <br />
got all deep.  Later, she could appreciate that in men.  But boys were icky.  And she was afraid that as much <br />
as she knew she was a girl, her body would decide something else.<br />
<br />
And puberty had run its course.  Her cock had grown from a tiny thing roughly the size of her pinky to several <br />
inches, and even longer when she was hard.  Her balls dropped.  Wiry hairs dusted it, and then crowned it.  <br />
Between the legs, yeah, she looked like a man.  <br />
<br />
But her voice remained soft and feminine, her thighs and butt had taken on a soft, rich curve, and...well, <br />
she'd been afraid the breasts would disappear, like some boys got them and then they went away.  But they had <br />
only become fuller and rounder, a solid D cup.  Her picture in a high school graduation didn't give away a bit <br />
of that tiny little abnormality.  <br />
<br />
She knew, objectively, that this was strange.  She'd never met another woman like her, or a man with a vagina-<br />
-at least, not a boy who had been born a boy who had, against all reason or logic, had a vagina from birth and <br />
still grown up as a man without some sort of medical assistance.<br />
<br />
She was happy being a woman with a cock.  And maybe someday she'd try what Jessica said she'd been born as--a <br />
woman with a vagina--but at the same time, there was just a tiny bit of curiosity...<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Nikki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make me a guy.  All the way.&quot;  She said, nervously.  &quot;DON'T.  Don't make me not remember this.&quot;  She said, <br />
gesturing at herself. &quot;I just...kinda wanna see what it's like.  For a day, tops.&quot;<br />
<br />
*click-click-click!*  &quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki looked at herself in the mirror, waiting for the change.<br />
<br />
It was subtle, at first.  The jawline thickened, the brow got just a bit heavier.  It wasn't a lot, but cast <br />
her face in a somewhat androgynous light.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot;  She said, testing the waters.  Her voice still sounded normal, for now.<br />
<br />
Her shirt began to feel tight, her bra straps digging in.  Quickly, she tossed both to the side; her full <br />
breasts were still respectably large, but her shoulders were broadening and muscle was building beneath them, <br />
making them less and less impressive.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;  Jessica called down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, I guess.&quot;  Nikki said.  Maybe she sounded a little hoarse now.  Maybe.  &quot;It feels weird.&quot;  She <br />
could see in her dresser mirror as the crests of her hips pulled in, and her curvy butt and thighs started to <br />
melt away.<br />
<br />
&quot;It hurts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot;  Oh, yeah.  Definitely hoarse, now.  &quot;Just...warm.  Tingly.&quot;  Her hands and feet grew just a <br />
little, and the hair on them darkened.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Huh.  Good, I was worried for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki turned to examine herself in the mirror from the side.  Her breasts were almost gone, and her butt <br />
was...kinda cute, she thought.  chiseled, attatched to a nice, muscular pair of legs.  &quot;YeAh, I--&quot;  Her voice <br />
broke, and she laughed, running a hand through her hair as it seemed to fall away, leaving something short and <br />
manageable.  <br />
<br />
She put her hands on her hips, and turned to face herself in the mirror one more time.  There were no trace of <br />
the tits, and now her skin tingled as dark hair grew sprouted along her legs and in her armpits, and her chest <br />
dusted itself lightly.<br />
<br />
Nikki felt the changes stop--no one thing, just a sudden certainty that her...well, his now, <br />
yeah...transformation into a man was complete.  The room around him changed, too, the bra on the floor <br />
stretching into a tank top, her blouse's buttons changing sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...Nikki.&quot;  Jessica had come back into the room, and looked him up and down.  &quot;Looking good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;  Nick said, running his hand through his hair in the mirror.  It was messy, but a kind of sexy messy  <br />
&quot;So is this what I'd look like if I'd been born a guy, for real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much.&quot;  Jessica said.  &quot;I didn't change anything else.&quot;  She bit her lip, and took a hesitant step <br />
towards her masculinized roommate.<br />
<br />
Nick watched her, and...oh, man.  She was blushing, smiling nervously...she was turned on, wasn't she?</p>
