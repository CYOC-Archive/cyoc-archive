<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul searches Jon&#39;s memories and remembers where he lives.  Paul starts skating to Jon&#39;s home. He moved quickly and before long he arrived at the two story McMansion.  Paul entered the house slowly, scanning Jon&#39;s memories. Paul made his way upstairs to Jon&#39;s room.  It was large with queen size bed, a desk, and poster of skimpily clad women on the walls.  Paul remembered Jon jacking off to them and smiled.  Jon&#39;s little cock stiffened to its full 3-inches, Paul was about to start playing with it when he heard a door slam downstairs, and a masculine voice yell &quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;  Jon&#39;s brother older brother Connor was home.  <br />
<br />
Connor was 19 but still lived at home.  He had a job at a bar, and continually said that he was going to go to college, but never filled out even a single application.  Connor often came home covered in glitter and sweat, and he was very cagy about ever admitting what bar he worked at, opting instead for a &quot;you&#39;ve never heard of it.&quot;  No one in the family knew that Connor was gay and he was actually working at a gay bar downtown.  He made pretty good money too, he was young, tall, and good looking.  Paul headed downstairs to find Connor. As he headed down to the first level, Paul had a flash of memory from Jon, Connor&#39;s room was in the basement, Paul found the basement stairs, opened the door and began to head down.<br />
<br />
Paul could hear water running, Connor must be taking a shower, he hoped.  Paul headed as silently as he could through the finished basement room towards the half bath that Connor was in. The door was wide open, Connor was not expecting anyone in his basement so he rarely closed it.  Paul positioned himself so that he could look into and see Connor in the shower.  Connor was facing the shower spiget which afforded Paul a view of Connor&#39;s plump ass.  It jiggled and stretched as Connor washed himself.  At one point Connor bent over, giving Paul a nice view of his large balls.  Finally, Connor turned around to rinse his back, Paul finally saw what he was hoping too, but with some disappointment.  Connor&#39;s penis was only a little bigger than Jon&#39;s when soft maybe 4-inches.  The package was made to look more ridiculous because Connor had such large balls.  Paul watched with a smirk on his face and a boner in his shorts, as Connor rinsed off paying extra attention to his disappointing penis.  He decided to take action, he was Jon after all, there were no consequences. <br />
<br />
&quot;He bro&quot; Connor heard, looking up in a hurry to see his younger brother Jon standing at the door.  &quot;What the fuck are you doing&quot; Connor yelled, covering his penis.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; Jon said, &quot;I&#39;ve already seen everything&quot; he gestured towards Connor&#39;s crotch.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ve got me beat&quot; Paul added, pulling down Jon&#39;s shorts revealing his 3&quot; erection.  Connor was shocked by what was happening, but he couldn&#39;t help but look down at his little brother&#39;s little penis.  &quot;Dude&quot; Connor said &quot;what the fuck are you doing?&quot; Paul watched as Connor&#39;s penis began to stiffen. &quot;Does it get any longer&quot; he asked ignoring Connor&#39;s continued protests.  <br />
<br />
Connor looked at his brother incredulously, not knowing what to make of this situation.  He had heard of brothers who did stuff like this, but he never believed anyone would be so open with family.  He wasn&#39;t sure what to do here, but he decided to go with it.  &quot;No&quot; Connor stated matter of factly, &quot;it just gets harder, but stays pretty much the same size.&quot;  Without skipping a beat, Paul moved closer and said &quot;show me&quot; his face smiling and his own boner still out and hard.  Again curiosity got the better of Connor, he had already come this far. Connor began tugging on his little cock, the shower providing some wetness to help his hand slide.  Just as Connor had said, his meager cock got harder but not much longer, maybe 4 and a quarter inches, it was thinner than Jon&#39;s, which now was making him self conscious.  <br />
<br />
Quickly and without asking Paul reached out and grabbed Connor&#39;s boner.  &quot;Wow&quot; Paul said to a Connor who was frozen in shock &quot; I wonder if mine will grow bigger than yours it&#39;s already fatter.&quot;  &quot;may maybe&quot; Connor studdered as his brother&#39;s warm little hand fondled his cock.  Then Connor reached out and slowly wrapped his hand around Jon&#39;s little dick, wrapping his fingers around it and moving it back and forth. Connor began stroking faster, and it didn&#39;t take long for Paul to cum in Connor&#39;s hand.  On instinct, Connor took his hand to his face and licked the sizable load up, swallowing it all.<br />
<br />
Both boys were silent, with only the noise of the shower in the room.  Paul decided on another bold move, &quot;you want me to suck that little dick&quot; he asked with a hint of condescension in his voice.  &quot;Yes&quot; Connor blurted out excitedly.  Paul got down on his knees, the warm water of the shower washing over him and Connor.  Paul took Connor&#39;s unit into his mouth and began moving his head and tongue back and forth.  Connor couldn&#39;t believe what was happening, he wondered if this was a trap or if he was dreaming.  Before too long the excitement got to him and he blew his load into his little brother&#39;s warm mouth.  &quot;Holy fuck&quot; he moaned as rope after rope left his cock.  He watched as his little brother looked up at him and swallowed his dick&#39;s load.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know I&#39;m gay&quot; Connor asked after a few moments of silence.  Paul played it cool, &quot;you&#39;re not that good at hiding it&quot; he said with a smirk as he stood up.  Connor looked down, shyly, he could see that Jon&#39;s cock was already hard again. The joys of youth he thought.  Paul watched as Connor admired his cock, &quot;you want it inside you?&quot; he asked.  Connor didn&#39;t respond his just turned around and bent slightly over, exposing his ass.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to be gentle&quot; Connor said over his shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m a power bottom and I&#39;m use to taking bigger cocks than yours.&quot;  Paul lined up Jon&#39;s cock and pushed it into Connor&#39;s hole.  Connor wasn&#39;t lying, his ass gave way easily.  Paul began pumping, he made it longer than previously, having recently came, but after a few minutes he couldn&#39;t hold back and he sprayed his load into his older brother&#39;s hole.  <br />
<br />
Connor turned off the shower and both boys dried off, before Paul returned upstairs to change into dry clothes.  Connor sat in his basement room, thinking about what he had done and what he would like to do next.</p>
