<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan saw a set of menus for choosing his character.  Interestingly, the program already had a character set up for him:  Bryan, M/20/6'/160lbs.  The icon of the character next to it looked like him as well, and with the blinking red light on the front of the Chronivac, he could only assume that it had some isometric scanning program which had made his default character look like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot; Bryan was really impressed.  These programs were getting fancier all the time.<br />
<br />
But it was kind of boring playing someone who looked just like you.  Roleplaying was all about taking things to extremes.<br />
<br />
There was a blinking box asking &quot;MODIFY BRYAN?&quot; and he clicked it, seeing a whole host of options popping up: Age, Sex, Height, Weight, Build, Race, and so forth, and a bunch of scroll bars with things like Hormone Levels, then a set of check boxes with names like &quot;Heroic Proportions,&quot; &quot;Mythic Proportions,&quot; &quot;Classical Proportions&quot; and so on.  Curious, he scroll over &quot;Heroic Proportions&quot; and an information box popped up, explaining: THE PROPORTIONS OF A HERO, TAKEN FROM THE COMMON TERMS FROM CLASSIC STATUARY.  TALLER AND BROADER THAN AN AVERAGE PERSON, WITH ATTRIBUTES MAGNIFIED.<br />
<br />
That sounded good, so Bryan checked it, as well as Mythic Proportions, which was likely just more of the same.  Classical Proportions sounded good too, so he gave it a check.<br />
<br />
There was a button that said &quot;Adult Options,&quot; so Brian clicked it, finding one of the first items that seemed clickable was &quot;Dick Size&quot; (nexted to a greyed out &quot;Breast Size&quot;)  He chuckled.  &quot;Kewl!&quot;  This was rad.<br />
<br />
He clicked it, and a box popped up saying &quot;Brian's Dick: 6 inches&quot;  He glanced at the scanner.  This thing was getting a bit personal, but he guessed it was just set with the default average which surveys said the adult male population had.  The same as his genetics did, which sucked.<br />
<br />
There were options below to add and subtract length and girth, and even one to play with the head to shaft ratio, while below that was a bar saying &quot;Population Distribution.&quot;  Bryan clicked that, finding that his length and girth were exactly dead average, at the highest point of the bell curve that was shown up for each.  He dragged the slider scale over to the far right for each, down to where the bell curve narrowed to a flat line, then watched as the popup refreshed, now showing that he was in the millionth percentile for each, but it was still possible to slide the bar over, since there were more than a million people on the planet.  He slid the two over so that the rarity for the size to be one in 500 million.  The explanation showed that this would make him 19.54&quot; long, with proportional girth, at his current height. (WARNING: Other options and modifications selected can and may affect this.  CLICK FOR EXPLANATION.)<br />
<br />
Bryan clicked it, finding that the old Heroic Proportions and Mythic Proportions he'd clicked would change this, as would Freakish Proportions, along with Testosterone Index, HGH Index and Masculinity index.<br />
<br />
He checked Freakish proportions as well, not bothering to read the explanation, then popped up Testosterone Index which was a part of an Adrenal Secretions panel along with HGH index.  Both of his read average, so he slid the testosterone over to 100% increase, then did the HGH for good measure.  He then clicked on the Masculinity Index, which was on a new panel labeled &quot;Sexual Dimorphism.&quot;  It appeared to go on a scale from 1 to 30.  Bryan found that it listed his score currently at 10, but mentioned &quot;After applied changes, combined Masculinity index will average 24.&quot;  He clicked the box for explanation, finding that a whole range of secondary sex characteristics: genital size, body hair, muscle distribution, fat distribution, shoulder to hip ratio, jaw size, brow size and so forth were used to calculate the index, and his extreme penis size and additional testosterion selections were raising the base average.<br />
<br />
Bryan clicked on &quot;Body Hair,&quot; finding it at average, though after the testosterone, it would go to a very high average.  He slid the bar over almost to the far right, wiggling with it until he found the masculinity index in the previous screen pop to 25 and then 26.<br />
<br />
This was fun, but he was wanting to see what the character looked like, so he popped back to the main screen, noting as he did that there was a menu he hadn't even looked at called &quot;Mental Changes.&quot;  He popped that up just for the hell of it, increased his character's IQ by 50 points, then clicked a box that said &quot;Normalized Outlook&quot; which sounded better than going down to all the sexual preferences, check boxes for fetishes, and everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn this things extreme,&quot; Bryan remarked, then clicked APPLY CHANGES.<br />
<br />
WARNING! the Chronivac flashed.  CLASSICAL PROPORTIONS OPTION IN CONFLICT WITH OTHER OPTIONS.  DESELECT OR APPLY CHANGES IN STAGES?<br />
<br />
Bryan clicked the second option.  He really didn't want to go through any more screens.  There were boxes to check for APPLY CHANGES INSTANTLY and APPLY CHANGES PERMANENTLY, and NORMALIZED OUTLOOK GLOBAL AND RETROACTIVE (SUGGESTED).  Yes, yes, and yes.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac whirred as he clicked the mouse a third time.<br />
<br />
PROCESSING CLASSICAL PROPORTIONS OPTION.  APPLYING.<br />
<br />
Bryan flinched as suddenly and instantly his body was tailored to classic Greco-Roman ideals of masculine beauty.  His hips narrowed, his shoulders flared, his facial features became perfectly regular and blemish free.<br />
<br />
PROCESSING HEROIC PROPORTIONS OPTION.  APPLYING.<br />
<br />
Bryan started to magnify, his proportions changing to those of a comic book hero or Greek god, his shoulders continuing to flare wider, his muscles swelling as the whole of him grew larger until he stood 1/4 taller than he had before, precisely seven and a half feet tall.<br />
<br />
PROCESSING MYTHIC PROPORTIONS.  CALCULATING.  FEET-PENIS-NOSE IN PERFECT PROPORTION, ALLOWING PREDICTION OF SIZE FROM COMMON MYTH.  ADAM'S APPLE HOWEVER UNDERSIZED, BELYING PREDICTION FROM CORRELARY MYTH.  CORRECTING. (CLASSICAL PROPORTIONS OPTION OVERRIDDEN.)<br />
<br />
Bryan's Adam's apple began to swell, getting larger and larger until it protruded from his throat as far as his nose did from his face.<br />
<br />
PROCESSING FREAKISH PROPORTIONS.  CALCULATING.  EXTREME HEIGHT, EXTREME MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT, EXTREME SHOULDER WIDTH AND ENLARGED ADAM'S APPLE ALL EQUALLY EXTREME.  EXAGGERATING ALL TO FREAKISH PROPORTION.  (FUTURE EXTREME TRAITS WILL BE SIMILARLY EXAGGERATED.)<br />
<br />
Bryan's shoulders and muscles swelled as he kept getting taller, his build going from heroically handsome if extreme until he stood 9' tall with 6' shoulders, ridiculously swolen muscles, and an adam's apple the size of an actual apple.<br />
<br />
MYTHIC PROPORTIONS REINITIATING.  PARAMETERS CHANGED.  CORRECTING FEET-PENIS-NOSE TO NEW ADAM'S APPLE RATIO.  INTERPRETING CLASSIC PROPORTIONS OPTION TO INCREASE HANDS IN RATIO TO FEET AND TESTICLES IN RELATION TO PENIS.<br />
<br />
Bryan's feet swelled, his tennis shoes expanding along with them until they were bigger than bigfoot's, and his hands increased to huge paws to match.  His penis increased massively, tenting out the front of his pants as his balls grew to match.  Not that he could see that well because his nose was suddenly dividing his field of vision.<br />
<br />
PROCESSING PENILE INCREASE.  ADJUSTING RELATED ATTRIBUTES.<br />
<br />
Bryan's dick, balls, hands, feet, adam's apple and nose all continued to grow, becoming not just the largest to be seen in 500 million average men, but 500 million heroically proportioned freaks!<br />
<br />
His hands were nearly the size of his head, except for the fact that a third of his head was his nose, and his adam's apple stuck out like a second chin.<br />
<br />
APPLYING HORMONAL INCREASE.  DOING SO SIMULTANEOUSLY.<br />
<br />
Bryan's already increased hormones from his giant balls surged, and the pituary increase made him grow another foot and a half.  He now stood ten and a half feet tall, with thick body hair and even more enormous muscles.<br />
<br />
INCREASING BODY HAIR.  PROCESSING.<br />
<br />
Bryan's already thick body hair continued to grow in, almost covering him in man fur.  His face, shaven, remained shaven, but the stubble prickled out, amazingly dark, as he was now the sort who would have to shave three times a day to remain anywhere clean shaven.<br />
<br />
ADDING 50 POINTS OF IQ.  PROCESSING.  CURRENT INTELLIGENCE LEVEL: GENIUS.<br />
<br />
Bryan blinked, brilliant thoughts occuring to him in an instant.<br />
<br />
HORMONAL LEVELS, BODY HAIR AND INTELLIGENCE ALL FREAKISH.  INCREASING.<br />
<br />
Bryan's hormones surged more as he grew taller and hairier, jumping another 100 points of IQ.<br />
<br />
NORMALIZING OUTLOOK, GLOBAL AND RETROACTIVE<br />
<br />
A wave blipped out from the Chronovac, making it so that so far as the world and Bryan knew, he'd always grown up this way.<br />
<br />
Bryan sat back down in his custom build chair, looking at the little laptop computer he'd been sent.  A toy with an isomorphic metric scanner, likely operating on gamma wavelengths to be able to register through his clothes, it was showing an icon of himself, 11'3&quot; tall, built like a living Tom of Finland character except for the huge nose and adam's apple.  He chuckled at how the readout mentioned that he had classic heroic mythic freakish proportions, along with a serious hormone imbalance and a dick he'd be able to suck himself except for the fact that the head didn't fit in his mouth, and fully erect, he was better set up to lick the shaft.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness he was so smart that he'd gone to college at age 10 and gotten his doctorate at 14 when he was still under 8' and before he'd started turning into even more of a freak.<br />
<br />
He started playing around with the program.  Taking an icon of himself out into the virtual world, eh, with the character built like he was?  Everyone would think it was a joke, or stare at him like they did whenever he went out the door, but hey, a virtual world was a fantasy life, and even freaky giant geniuses hung like Priapus and with a memory line Mnesonyme could have fun.<br />
<br />
He clicked on Mental Options.  He liked himself, and he wouldn't change anything about himself except one.  The one thing he would change about himself would be his confidence level....</p>
