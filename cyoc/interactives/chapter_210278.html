<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What--What do you want me to turn you into?&quot; Finn asked.<br />
<br />
Dylan reached for the phone. &quot;Just let me do it,&quot; he said, but Finn was quick enough to get it away from him. His eyes turned to a glare. &quot;Really? You don&#39;t trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then tell me what you want to change,&quot; Finn repeated the statement before every change he made. <br />
<br />
A heavy huff blew through Dylan&#39;s nose. &quot;Fine. I wanna be built like a jock. Like a muscular one with abs. Not a fat one. But I don&#39;t want to have to work for it. Like have muscles that everyone can see and are strong, but I don&#39;t ever have to go to the gym. And that I don&#39;t have to wear a shirt if I don&#39;t want to. And that everyone will be jealous of my big fat cock. Make it like a foot long and really thick and whenever a guy finds out about it, they can&#39;t stop thinking about it for a while. Like they really want to see it and hold it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn stopped listening after the jock comment. Even as he started typing, Dylan just kept going. He&#39;d always been rather skinny and small. But compared to Finn, he was still a couple inches taller. &#39;Dylan is 6&#39;4&quot; 260 pound muscular man. He looks like someone who works out frequently, but barely has to try at all. His cock is a foot long with baseball sized balls but doesn&#39;t hinder his ability to have sex.&#39; However, after that sentence, Finn made the other man unaware of changes. Even Finn was surprised as to how much of a furry kick he was on right now, but he quickly added a few more sentences. &#39;Dylan is an anthro horse. He likes to dress a bit country with plaid button up shirts and blue jeans. Often wandering around campus with a cowboy hat and straw in his mouth. He thinks that I gave him everything that he wanted to change about his body.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;He-hey!&quot; Dylan finally stopped talking. &quot;I wasn&#39;t--&quot; He was cut short as his heart rate must have picked up. Veins were starting to bulge out of his skin. &quot;Woah...&quot; His attention shifted away from the laundry list of demands and to the muscles starting to grow on his body. His small biceps instantly doubled in size. He couldn&#39;t help but flex them watching them round out and grow with each additional flex. Bones started to crack and shift as his body was building itself to grow nearly a foot taller than it had been. <br />
<br />
Excitement filled his face and voice as he continued to grow. &quot;Oh fuck yeah... This is what a horse is supposed to look like,&quot; he said. A smile filled Finn&#39;s face as Dylan had no idea that was part of the change either. Even though, at the moment he looked like a well hung country jock, with a face full of brown hair and a bit of it peaking through his unbuttoned dark blue and black plaid shirt, Dylan had no idea he wasn&#39;t part horse. The baggy shorts he always wore changed to a blue denim. They quickly molded around his muscular ass, perfectly showing off the perfectly sculpted behind.<br />
<br />
Though, it was hard to know if people would be more distracted by that or the obscene bulge protruding from his front. Finn hadn&#39;t quite thought about just how large two baseball sized balls truly would be, nor did he think about the ramifications from the foot long cock. Maybe it was just because Dylan was hard right now, but with how tight his jeans were it was impossible to miss the snake running down his left leg. <br />
<br />
Not that Dylan cared. He was too busy rubbing his pecs. A proud, &quot;Hooo boy!&quot; echoed off the pool&#39;s ceramic tiles as he felt his heavy pecs and ran his hand over his newly cut abs. Instead of human hair covering his body, it was rapidly changing to coarse brown fur. It ran up his thick muscular arms all the way down to his hands. The four fingers were starting to fuse together into two much thicker ones. He didn&#39;t seem to care as his entire hand widened and filled with callouses, allowing him to lift heavier weights easier.<br />
<br />
A cowboy hat appeared on top of his head and one of his horse ears flickered with excitement. &quot;This is so cool,&quot; he said. His nostirls started to flare outwards, filling his face. It started to look more natural as his face extended more into a large horse&#39;s snout. The fur on top of his nose was bright white in an elongated spade shape. The hair on his head however, had grown long and unruly. The short, cropped hair was now running down the sides of his face and down his neck giving him a wilder look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks there little buddy,&quot; Dylan said, a bit of a country twang in his voice. Finn&#39;s eyes were locked onto the mountainous pecs and perfectly cut abs directly in his face. With Dylan&#39;s wide open shirt, it was impossible to miss them. &quot;Now just one more thang...&quot; He reached down and grabbed Finn&#39;s phone out of his hand.<br />
<br />
It took Finn a moment to realize what was going on. &quot;HEY!&quot; he shouted, jumping up and down to reach it. It only drew a heavy breath of laughter through Dylan&#39;s nose as he didn&#39;t even have to raise it above his head to keep it out of Finn&#39;s reach. But he continued typing without much of a second thought. Finn did the only thing he could do and climbed the mountain of a man. His small hands gripped and groped the strong muscles under his tight fitting shirt. But when he got to his shoulders, Finn jumped for his phone.<br />
<br />
Another laugh fell out of Dylan&#39;s mouth. &quot;It&#39;s alright there buddy. I already gone and made my change,&quot; the southern accent was impossible for Finn to ignore. He felt abnormally comforted and turned on by it. His body felt weak and all he wanted to do was curl up in those big strong muscles. Dylan started walking towards him. The heavy cowboy boots clicked with each step. His tail gently swayed back and forth. He placed his cowboy hat down on Finn&#39;s head. The ear holes seemed to magically fit him. &quot;Now, how bout that date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second!&quot; Finn jumped back a few steps. He clutched his phone. However, his breathing was becoming a bit unhinged as he stared at the sexy man. Every bit of him oozed masculinity. From his rolled up sleeves down to his cowboy boots, all Finn could do was picture himself with Dylan. &quot;What&#39;d you change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan huffed a sigh. &quot;Not much. Just that you want to go on a date with me as much as I want to go on a date with you.&quot; Finn looked down at his phone to see that was the last change. His heart sped up. He was dating Jeff. Not Dylan. However, now he couldn&#39;t get the large horse out of his mind. &quot;Well?&quot; Dylan outstretched his hand. &quot;How bout you gon an&#39; give me that there phone and we can plan our date.&quot;</p>
