<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty heard a loud commotion at school the following morning, just as he walked through the main doors of the <br />
building where the classrooms were. He saw one of the bigger kids walk right past him, and one of the shorter, <br />
younger boys, with his back against the row of metal lockers, cringing in pain.<br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhnn… I’m so tired of this!” the boy groaned, as he tried to move his legs. It was quite clear that he <br />
was hurting. <br />
<br />
Ty used his powers to scan his mind. The boy’s name was Aiden. He was short and skinny, and only fourteen <br />
years old, so a year younger than Ty. Arnold, one of the bigger and stronger guys, he had shoved Aiden into <br />
the lockers because Aiden didn’t have a Dollar on him. Aiden was used to getting bullied, but it was clear <br />
that the boy was getting enough of being pushed around by the bigger guys.<br />
<br />
Ty walked up to Aiden and extended his hand to him. Aiden was in his history class, and he had always been <br />
nice to him. Ty figured it was time to help his classmate out. First of all, Ty needed to make it unattractive <br />
for Aiden to get bullied all the time. Second, Ty wanted to have a big muscle guy as his boyfriend. <br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” Ty asked Aiden.<br />
<br />
“No! Does it look like I’m alright, Ty? I just got my body slammed into the lockers! I’m hurting all over! I <br />
can barely move!” Aiden groaned.<br />
<br />
“Tell you what… If I help you so you’ll never get bullied again, then will you be my boyfriend?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“I’ll… I’ll do anything just to have this torture STOP!” Aiden replied, as he slowly tried to step forward. <br />
His back was killing him, so were his legs, his arms and his shoulders. “I come to school to learn, not to <br />
feel pain!”<br />
<br />
Ty extended his hand for a handshake. So did Aiden. <br />
<br />
“Deal?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you got yourself a deal, Ty!”<br />
<br />
“So, you’re my boyfriend now?”<br />
<br />
“Sure… I’ll be your boyfriend!” Aiden replied.<br />
<br />
“Good, because all your muscles will start to grow… Right NOW!” Ty ordered.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking ab---?” Aiden wondered, when he felt an intense tingling course through every muscle in <br />
his body!<br />
<br />
Aiden’s biceps began to swell, as well as his pectorals, his quadriceps, his hamstrings, his calves, his <br />
abdominals, his lats… Everything! Every muscle in the boy’s body suddenly grew larger and larger, like an air <br />
pump had attached to his body and was filling his body with air like an inflatable balloon! The only <br />
difference was, that his muscles were filling up with more muscle!<br />
<br />
“Whooaaaaa!!” Aiden gasped out loud, as he felt his body expand in every direction, as he burst out of his t-<br />
shirt, followed by a loud rip coming from his jeans!<br />
<br />
His expanding quads and calves had torn massive holes in his jeans as his calves inflated to soccer-ball-size, <br />
and they were still growing! His quads were becoming bigger, longer, thicker and wider, as layers of muscle <br />
kept on appearing over his quads above his knees!<br />
<br />
Aiden’s arms grew bigger and thicker as his biceps and triceps became as hard as bowling balls! Huge, round <br />
spheres of muscle formed over his arms as long, thick veins began to form all over them as well. His pectorals <br />
just pushed out further and further, making his chest and torso become wider and deeper while widening his <br />
amazing shoulders at the same time! Aiden was becoming a bodybuilder… and MORE!<br />
<br />
“Uhhhhh! I’m… getting… really… BIG!” Aiden gasped, as he felt his body get bigger and heavier with every <br />
passing second.<br />
<br />
Ty just looked on, with his arms folded, as Aiden continued to explode with muscle. He was waiting for the <br />
right moment to tell his muscle growth to stop.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re big enough… You’re almost too big! Okay! Stop growing!” Ty said casually.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s incredible growth spurt came to an abrupt halt!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Aiden gasped, as he needed a minute to catch his breath, while looking down at his huge muscle-<br />
bound physique. He was massive!<br />
<br />
“I need to fix these clothes!” Ty said, as he waved his hand.<br />
<br />
The torn t-shirt morphed into a large tank top that fit over Aiden’s big, broad shoulders. And his ripped <br />
jeans now transformed into a pair of shorts which now fit over Aiden’s expanded torso.<br />
<br />
“Ty! You weren’t kidding! I’m a big muscle guy! This is amazing!” Aiden said, as he examined his super-<br />
muscular body. The boy was almost 7 feet tall and he carried over 400 pounds of muscle on his frame.<br />
<br />
“Now, about the boyfriend part…” Ty began.<br />
<br />
Aiden walked up to Ty and lifted him up, Then he embraced him in a bear hug before kissing him on the <br />
forehead. <br />
<br />
“What should we do next, sweetie?” Aiden grinned, while holding Ty in his thick, muscular arms…</p>
