<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jeez he looks hot!&quot; Ty thought as a small crowd formed around Matt.  <br />
<br />
Mr Carter - the replacement Math tutor - entered through the doorway into the classroom.  He was an intimidating man.  Old (Ty had no idea how old, but old enough to be the crypt keeper at least).  In his hay day, he would have been attractive, hot even.  But in his age later years his hair was greying, liver spots adorned his hands, and he wore small oval glasses that screamed &#39;retirement is near&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down class.&quot;  He muttered.  Despite the class&#39; vocal behaviour, they all returned to their seats as soon as Mr Carter spoke.  <br />
<br />
Ty took his seat behind Matt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is great&quot; he thought.  &quot;Now I can sit back and get a good view of the fireworks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Carter was furiously scribbling some complicated formulas on the blackboard.  &quot;Remove your stationary from your bags.  On your desks you have a conveniently placed answer sheet and question sheet.  Answer all of the questions on the page.  You have one hour exactly to complete this test.  I suggest that you do NOT spend the time doodling over your answer sheet and make an EFFORT to attempt the questions listed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty took a look at the question and answer sheet.<br />
<br />
... Perfect.  <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Algebra....<br />
<br />
... <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
ALGEBRA!<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Matt would grow bigger each time he answers a question correctly.  No one will notice the growth except for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Your time starts ........ now ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Minutes passed as the class studied and answered the paper.  Every now and again Ty would glance up from his desk to see the white tee that Matt was wearing.  Nothing had changed.  <br />
<br />
Five out of the fifteen questions had been answered.  Ty looked up from his desk again.  Nothing had changed.  Matt was still sitting hunched over his paper, writing furiously.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on!!!  He can&#39;t be THAT bad at algebra!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Matt could answer all of the questions on the test correctly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Matt looked up from his desk toward the wall behind Mr Carter.  Knowledge of complicated mathematics flowed into his mind as he unlocked the secrets of &#39;x&#39; and &#39;y&#39;.  He took pen to paper and began to answer the questions.  <br />
<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes passed, and Matt&#39;s tee shirt finally started to look a little tight around the arms.  He shifted it up as he felt his biceps swell with newfound power.  His expansive back was widening, growing thicker and more muscular.  His chest began to bulk up. His round pectorals strained at the white tee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unnnnnggggg .....&quot;  Matt moaned as he swelled bigger and bigger.  None of his classmates took any notice of the audible noises coming from their classmate: all were too focussed on the challenging paper before them.  Mr Carter continued to study his crossword as his student continued to expand larger with each successful question answered.  <br />
<br />
His body continued to pump itself bigger and fuller, causing Matt to reach a height of 7&#39; and weighing in at 300lbs.  Tears began to form at the sides of his cannon-like arms and the stretching of his pecs.  His face sharpened as he became more manly, progressing to the age of 19.  a thin layer of stubble joined his shaven sideburns, while his lips filled out to give him that manly supermodel look.  <br />
<br />
Ty looked on as his friend&#39;s expansive back continued to swell, taking up his vision of the blackboard almost entirely.  He could see the muscles bulge against the white shirt, which was beginning to suffer under the strain of the growth.  None of the class seemed any the wiser, accustomed to this hulking man getting bigger in the middle of their classroom.  <br />
<br />
Matt looked down beneath his desk to see his swelling manhood beneath his black gym shorts - from 12&#39; to 13&#39;, then 14&#39;, then 15 inches long.  He felt his ball sack swell until his testicles were the size of oranges.  They churned with manly seed against his quads - massive beastly muscles that were bursting with power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh fuck ... I&#39;m getting sooo biggg .....&quot;<br />
<br />
he reached a paw down his gym shorts and hoisted his flaccid penis out of its confines.  Such was its power that it began to tilt the desk upward as it swelled bigger and bigger with his growing form.  He closed his eyes, blissfully ignorant of the students as they were of him.  Except for Ty, who watched intently from behind at his friend&#39;s ever expanding form.    <br />
<br />
&quot;Your time is up!  Please put down your pens, pencils, or whatever you have been using to illustrate your answers.&quot; <br />
<br />
The class laid down their pens.  Some were satisfied with their answers.  Some cursed the heavens at the luck.  They began talking amongst themselves about the test or other menial gossip of the day.<br />
<br />
No one batted an eye at the behemoth sitting two rows to the side, four rows back from the doorway.  At 7&#39;2 and 350lbs, Matt was easily the biggest guy in school.  His body had thickened by packing on more and more muscle while he sat precariously in his seat, his massive ass had swelled to the point that he now sat comically while jacking himself off blissfully.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that was a ride!&quot;  Ty said to himself.  &quot;Hey Matt!  How did you do on the test?&quot;<br />
<br />
His question was answered by a series of low moans and groans from the muscle beast he had created.</p>
