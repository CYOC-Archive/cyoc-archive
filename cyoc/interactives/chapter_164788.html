<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucker woke up and rolled out of bed. Once again, it took him a few moments to adjust to his new height and weight. He just felt so.. top heavy and solid. Even walking to the bathroom was different, each foot fall going from a light step to something with real weight to it. He flicked on the light and blinked. Other than his facial features there was little of the old Tucker looking back at him.<br />
<br />
He was now sporting a jawful of dark blond stubble that could be grown into a full beard, though it could do to maybe be a little fuller as it still looked sparse in places. His chest was half covered in curly blond hair, and a stripe a couple of inches wide grew down over his six pack stomach. His pits were hairy enough that he could see little tufts of hair even with his arms down, and he had a respectable bush around his thick cock.<br />
<br />
Right.. the cock.. He had promised to go back to the store so they could check out how the product had worked. Instead of shaving again, he decided to just enjoy being hairier for a bit and hopped in the shower. Soaping up his body was a whole different experience with all the body hair and soon he found one hand trying to fit around his cock, while he rubbed soap into his hairy chest with the other. It wasn&#39;t long before he was splashing his seed along the tile wall of the shower, panting heavily. Hopefully he could learn a little lasting power, too, but he had become the type of guy he used to pursue, from twink to young blossoming muscle bear. It was going to take getting used to.<br />
<br />
Cleaning up, he stepped out of the shower and into his room. Instantly, there was a problem. He couldn&#39;t find any clothes that fit. Going to the store naked wasn&#39;t an option, and ordering anything online would still take days. Desperate, he dug to the bottom of his drawer. There was a pair of gym shorts with enough stretch he could get them on, even if they hugged his legs and looked a little short on him. A tee-shirt one of his exes had left behind because it was a little on the ratty side fit.. barely. It hugged his chest and arms a little too close, but it would do. Same with an old pair of flip flops that were actually a size or two too small for his feet but would do for now. He could stop in on a clothing store on his way back home and at least buy a few things.<br />
<br />
Crap, he&#39;d need a whole new wardrobe, work clothes, too. He ran a hand through his shaggy blond hair and looked himself over in the mirror. He looked like an idiot dressed in clothing much too small for him, but it would have to do for now. The shorts were much too small, and his new oversized member made a large bulge. If not for a pair of stretchy underwear, the head would probably be hanging out of the leg of the shorts for all to see.<br />
<br />
Grabbing his keys and wallet he quickly scampered out the door. He got looks on his way down the street to the shopping district. He expected most of them to be amused, and while some were, many more were appraising, appreciative, or down right lusty. He found himself returning a few smiles, though his new longer stride got him to the store sooner than expected and he slipped inside.<br />
<br />
Locke was behind the counter again, he looked up and laughed. &quot;Oh, sorry, I must have forgotten to warn you to get some larger clothing.&quot; As Locke stepped closer he realized he was bigger than the clerk now. Where before he had to look up to see Locke&#39;s face, now he actually looked down a little. He was more muscular than Locke&#39;s lean swimmers build, too. Not by much, but enough to see it standing side by side. &quot;I think we might have some extra workout clothing in the back we could give you. Didn&#39;t sell well, and no it&#39;s not magical. Enough you can go into the store without looking like a kid that suddenly turned into an adult. So.. did you enjoy the bonus item.&quot; Locke was already looking down at the bulge in Tucker&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. yeah..&quot; Tucker unconsciously adjusted himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. might as well do the check first, come on.&quot; Locke headed into the back room, Tucker following. It was not like a normal store&#39;s back room. Sure there were boxes and shelves of product, but there was also what looked like a full laboratory, and a bookshelf full of old leather bound tomes. There was another man in the back. In his late forties, he had wings of grey at his temples, but was what most people would describe as a silver fox. He was fit and fashionably dressed, his hair styled and perfectly groomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Telos, here&#39;s the customer I told you about.&quot; When the man, Telos, looked up, Tucker met his eyes and suddenly had the feeling he was seeing someone much older than the forty some odd years he had guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one that tried our new custom cock product?&quot; He asked as he stood up. Locke nodded, and Telos motioned to Tucker. &quot;Strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Master Telos&#39; voice carried such a tone of expecting to be obeyed, Tucker did so without even questioning it. He took off the clothing, sighing as some of the bands that had been digging into him were now gone. Locke had picked up a clipboard but was eyeing Tucker rather appreciatively. Telos grabbed a pair of rubber gloves and pulled them on, then dragged a chair over to where Tucker stood and sat down. Without a word, he hefted Tucker&#39;s cock in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave him that obscene one you designed?&quot; Instead of chiding, Telos sounded amused. &quot;Well, I guess it does really provide a good test going extreme.&quot; He began to chant words as he ran his hand above Tucker&#39;s shaft. Other than the hand holding it up, he wasn&#39;t touching or rubbing it, but Tucker still felt himself getting erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems to have worked perfectly. Less than one percent deviation from the design, fully functional, no errors, no conflicts with..&quot; Telos&#39; hand ran up and down Tucker&#39;s stomach and chest, &quot;... with the other spells currently affecting him.&quot; Telos&#39; hand waved over his cock and said a few more words. Tucker&#39;s balls instantly churned, and in a moment he was cumming, Telos quickly grabbing a bottle and catching every last drop. As soon as he let go of Tucker, he felt himself going soft again.<br />
<br />
Telos swirled the jar of cum and set it in front of a light, whispering a few more words. &quot;Everything is normal. I&#39;d call it a complete success.&quot; The master mage nodded approvingly, smiling at Tucker. &quot;I&#39;ll be certain to let you know if I have other products I wish to test, we offer payment in both cash or store credit. You seem to synergize with the magic remarkably well, makes for a nice test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for this..&quot; Telos motioned at the cock. &quot;Do you want me to return it to something more manag..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Tucker quickly chimed in before Telos finished his question. &quot;That is.. I.. I think I&#39;m fine with it the way it is. I can always come back if it becomes a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of being insulted by being interrupted, Telos seemed amused. &quot;I think you may have found a kindred soul, Locke. Very well, I&#39;ll leave it be, but you can have it adjusted once free of charge if it does become a hassle. Now get the poor man here some clothes that fit, Locke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Telos went back to work, it was obviously a dismissal. Locke dragged tucker to another part of the storage room and began to rifle through boxes, handing him a few items. Eventually he had a pair of track pants, a pair of sandals, and a tank top that fit. Well, the tank top was a little tight, and hugged his torso, showing off all his new muscle, and he was pretty sure Locke gave him the slightly too small shirt on purpose, but it was enough that it didn&#39;t look silly. Luckily there was a clothing store between this store and his home he could get a few more things at.<br />
<br />
Locke escorted him back out to the floor and slipped something into his hand. &quot;For later.&quot; Locke winked.<br />
<br />
Tucker wondered what product sample he got slipped this time, and opened his hand to look. It was just a folded piece of paper with a phone number and a note: I&#39;m off at six.<br />
<br />
Tucker just grinned at the note, grinned at Locke with a wink, and left the store.</p>
