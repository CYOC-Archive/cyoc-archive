<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After no one voluntarily decided to be first, Diana made the choice for them. &quot;You there, boy with the blonde hair. Come forward and receive your role.&quot; Diana beckoned with her index finger and Will suddenly couldnt move his body like he wanted to anymore. As if it had a mind of its own, his body walked towards Diana. Diana took out 4 strips of folded paper and placed them within her deep cleavage with a mischievous grin. &quot;Now don&#39;t be shy, pick your role, and don&#39;t be afraid to, dig around a bit to find the best one&quot; Diana teased, much to Tom and Rachel&#39;s, but especially Christina&#39;s displeasure.<br />
<br />
Will regained control of just his right arm and hand, and reluctantly reached into her cleavage in order to pick his role. After a few seconds, he finally found a piece of paper and pulled it out. Diana took it from his hand and put it on display on one of the walls. There were only just 2 words were written on the paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Royal Princess&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&quot; whispered Rachel, frustrated that her role was taken. However no one was more upset than Will was. &quot;What the fuck do you mean by Royal Princess? I am not a girl, so at least it should be Royal Prince, right?!?&quot; Will shouted.<br />
<br />
Diana gave him a sly grin and simply said &quot;Nope&quot;, after which a ball of magic flew out of her hand and hit Will in the chest, sending him off flying towards the wall, which he slipped right through as if it didn&#39;t exist. Then Will appeared to be projected onto the wall. He was in a much smaller room now, but seemed fine for the most part, or at least until the changes started. <br />
<br />
Everyone watched in silence as Will&#39;s hair slowly started turning pitch black and lengthen until it finally landed just above his thighs. The messy hair became straight, with a few slight curls near the end. Some of it was also done up into a decorative crown braid too. All of his clothing disappeared suddenly, and his body became restrained, so that he couldn&#39;t hid anything. His eyes turned a glowing deep crimson red, and a pair of black horns pushed their way out of his head, curling around to the front, giving Will the appearance of wearing a black tiara. Next his ears pushed out and back a bit, into long pointed tips. <br />
<br />
Wills face was now becoming feminine, as his head finished becomming that of a girl with &quot;extraordinary looks&quot;. Now it moved down to his shoulders, pulling them in a bit as his arms thinned out, ending in a pair of delicate feminine hands with long, well kept nails.<br />
<br />
As the process progressed, Wills voice turned to one of pure seduction and femininity, as his transformation into a half-succubus/half human, Royal Princess continued. When the changes reached his chest, 2 boobs sprung out and inflated until Will now had a nice large pair of FF-cups adorning his chest. His waisst shrunk inwards as both his hips and ass expanded into flawless proportions. <br />
<br />
The next thing to go was his dick, as it shot back up inside him and changed into his, now her, brand new pussy. From abover her ass, a tail snaked out as well as a pair of black feathered wings pushed themselves out of her hips near the small of her back with a flap. The last thing to change were her legs, becoming long and hairless, as all of her body hair fell off, including her pubic hair, leaving behind one of the most attractive being in existance that any of the others, including Diana, had ever seen. <br />
<br />
Her skin tone lightened a bit as her tan disappeared. Clothes began appearing on her body. First was the sexy pair of black laced underwear, followed by a pair of tall black heels, styled in a more fantasy-esque way though. A corset pushed her boobs up, making her already inpressive bust even more alluring. Lastly a long, red, victorian style dress covered her body as body, as her wings folded into her hips, and horns retreated into her head. Her ears also became human like, and her tail coiled around her, with the tip stuck inside of her pussy. Will seemed to be carring herself in a very elegant manner, and while her cleavage was even more impressive than Diana&#39;s was, it was her deep crimson eyes, that made her truely immaculate. Just looking into them gave you a sense of submission, and a willingness/desire to serve under her. However the moment they glowed, meant you would wish to be her&#39;s forever.<br />
<br />
Diana waved her hands, and the wall opened up to let Will back inside. She strutted in her heels whike accentuating her hip&#39;s sway and with a posture that showed off her bouncing cleavage. Luckily, Will still seemed to be in control, and didn&#39;t wish to charm the 3 humans at this time. She knew they were her friends, but more importantly, they could always be charmed later whenever she felt like it. They would become like putty in her hands. Diana seemed to not be affected for some reason too. With a shrug after failing to charm Diana, Will returned to her spot and sat down, crossing her leg, while naturally taking a seductive pose. On the screen behind Diana, a character card appeared.<br />

It was quite an impressive character to say the least. Stat wise, she was seemingly broken, although no numbers were given to show it, or they were left hidden intentionally. Either way, the 3 remaining humans could feel the pressure in the room shift as Willa looked up towards Diana, clearly unamused by her &quot;prank&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well you all should have noticed how her personality is slightly different now. That is normal and in fact expected given how she has underwent such a drastic change and all. This personality is only for this game, and isn&#39;t necessarily set in stone either. It may even change as time goes on!&quot; No one said a word, and only Willa moved, swapping her crossed legs, still looking unamused and pretty pissed off, though just a bit more relaxed, now that everything was finally finished with her. &quot;Now then, with that all said and done, who&#39;s next?&quot; Asked Diana.</p>
