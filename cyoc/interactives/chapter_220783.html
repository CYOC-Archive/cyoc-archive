<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Someone sounds hungry.&quot; Mel said. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go over to the sitting area and I&#39;ll give you a bottle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sitting area had changed in this world too. It still had the picnic tables and benches, but several of the tables had an oversized highchair seat built onto the end. There were also wide rockers on springs, the shape of their armrests indicated that they were for caretakers to feed their Littles comfortably. A few of them were already occupied and Mel took her place among the mothers and other Au Pairs with Heather on her lap. Once she was comfortable, she reached into the diaper bag under the stroller and pulled out a large bottle. She gave it a vigorous shake and pulled the cap off.<br />
<br />
If Heather had been able to, she would have spat out her pacifier. The bottle looked, for the most part, like an oversized baby one. All except for the nipple. The nipple was distinctly phallic shaped. Heather boggled at it and wondered what the other women would think if they noticed it. She didn&#39;t have to wait long to find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Said an older, grey-haired Au Pair. &quot;She&#39;s at that age already. Littles seem to grow up so quick these days. My Millie here didn&#39;t start using those until she was 19.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old Au Pair indicated her own charge, a woman in her 40&#39;s who was eagerly suckling her own bottle. As Heather watched, the grey-haired woman reached down and pressed firmly on a bulge in the crotch of of her Little&#39;s diaper several times. The Little woman moaned in time with the with her caregiver&#39;s hand. Heather realized that it must be a rather large dildo held in place by the padding. She was reminded of the toy that she still had inside of her. Mel must have remembered too because only a moment later Heather let out a muffled squeal of pain and pleasure as the toy suddenly began vibrating hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; the other Au Pair cooed. &quot;They&#39;re just so cute aren&#39;t they. We&#39;re lucky we got horny ones, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes indeed.&quot; Mel replied.<br />
<br />
Heather realized, though the rising haze of sexual pleasure, that the other Au Pairs present were looking at them with jealousy evident in their expressions. She watched as one of the Littles, a teen girl just a few years older than herself, finished her bottle. When her Au Pair pulled it free the nipple proved to be quite ordinary. Heather knew that this meant something about the rules of this world, but she was too distracted by the buzzing toy to care. She wasn&#39;t so distracted that she missed Mel pulling out her pacifier. As Heather had already begun to expect, it had the same penile shape that her bottle did. She didn&#39;t have time to comment as the bottle quickly replaced it.<br />
<br />
Mel chatted amiably with the others while Heather sucked down her liquid lunch. The nipple&#39;s shape repulsed her, but the flavor of the formula was indescribable. As much as she wanted to get the miniature cock out of her mouth, she couldn&#39;t help but continue sucking to get more of the deliciously sweet drink. The bottle was large and it took her some time to drain it. It was quickly replaced by a second one. During all of this, the spiny toy was vibrating away inside her. Occasionally one of the spines would rub up against a sensitive spot and she would moan around the bottle. This always got the attention of the other women who would make quick comments about how cute she was.<br />
<br />
When the second bottle was finished Mel switched the toy off and left Heather to lay there gasping on her lap. As insidious as it was, the little vibrator had not been enough to get her off. She kept trying to rub herself, but her hands were still not obeying. In addition to making it so she couldn&#39;t fight back or dress herself, Mel must have made it so she couldn&#39;t pleasure herself either. She whimpered and bucked her hips a few times. Before she could plead for release, Mel stuck the phallic pacifier back in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s getting a little antsy.&quot; A mother commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mel said, squeezing Heather&#39;s diaper. &quot;I think she needs a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if I do it?&quot; A middle-aged Au Pair asked quickly. &quot;I&#39;ve only ever had boys and I would love to change a girl for once. Especially one as horny as her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be my guest.&quot; Mel said.<br />
<br />
Heather felt herself get lifted out of Mel&#39;s arms and carried over to one of the tables. She looked back over at Mel and saw that she was entertaining this Au Pair&#39;s charge, a young man in his early twenties. The Au Pair held her easily with one arm while she laid out a changing pad on the tabletop. Heather was sat on the surprisingly soft pad and in one fluid motion the woman had unsnapped her onesie and pulled it off over her head. She tried in vain to cover herself as the woman pushed her down onto her back and opened her diaper. She was quick and efficient with the wipes, Heather barely had time to register how cold they were. Then she felt fingers probing her slit. She gasped and tried to bring her knees together, but the scenario wouldn&#39;t let her. The fingers dug deeper, and then pulled out, taking the toy with them. The woman held it up in triumph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh.&quot; She marveled. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen one of these before. Where did you get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a, uh, gift.&quot; Mel said hesitantly. &quot;I don&#39;t know where to buy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shame.&quot; The woman said. &quot;My girlfriend would love something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wrapped the toy in a fresh wipe and placed it onto the table. Then she tapped the plug in Heather&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very familiar with these.&quot; She said. &quot;I think we&#39;ll leave it though. I&#39;m tired of assholes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather wondered what she meant. She got more than an answer as the woman raised the hem of her skirt. The tights she was wearing were crotch-less, as were the panties underneath. This left something dangling that Heather had not expected to see. Mel wandered over with the Little man on her hip and let out a low whistle at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The woman said wistfully. &quot;I&#39;m still on the fence about whether I actually want to get rid of it or not. It would be nice to go full woman, but it can be so useful sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s cock wasn&#39;t that big, just a little above average, but it stuck out like a sore thumb on the otherwise feminine body. At first Heather thought that Mel&#39;s meddling with the settings had caused this, then she remembered that that feature wasn&#39;t available yet, not even for Beta. Whoever this woman was in the real world, she was naturally trans. Then, as the woman grabbed her hips and pulled her closer to the edge of the table, Heather realized what was about to happen. She looked at Mel in terror, but Mel only had eyes for the woman&#39;s rapidly swelling dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; The woman asked.<br />
<br />
Heather tried to indicate that she very much did mind. Then she realized that the woman was talking to Mel, not her, and she was asking a different question entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Mel said, &quot;I don&#39;t mind. I think it actually looks kind of cute on you. I would keep it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; The woman sighed with relief. &quot;So many people are quick to judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather wouldn&#39;t have minded either. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the woman was lining it up with Heather&#39;s entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Mel said. &quot;Don&#39;t you need a condom? I know you&#39;re clean, being an Au Pair and all, but I don&#39;t think Heather&#39;s on the pill yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry. While I do still have all my former bits, I had a vasectomy years ago. There&#39;s no worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather once again tried to indicate that there was a worry, but it was too late. The woman pushed her hips forward and sunk her shaft deep into Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; The woman gasped, &quot;You&#39;re a lot tighter than my girlfriend. Though not as tight as the Littles I usually work with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The diapered man in Mel&#39;s arms grinned at this. Heather failed to notice. The woman had begun thrusting and was rapidly picking up speed. The other Au Pairs, parents, and caregivers that were nearby flocked over to watch. Heather moaned every time the woman&#39;s hips slapped against her ass. Her dick was nothing like a toy. For one thing it was very warm. Heather could feel the heat of it deep inside of her. It was also softer than the vibrators and dildos she had experienced recently. Yet it still seemed as rigid as a steel rod. Heather was already on the edge to begin with, so it didn&#39;t take long before before she came. The woman noticed this and quickened her pace in response. While Heather was still mid-orgasm she felt the jets of hot liquid spurt into her. Then the cock was suddenly removed. Heather lifted her head muzzily and watched as the woman turned and presented her dick to her Little, who began eagerly sucking it clean. Mel was nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
Heather was about to try and sit up when she felt warm breath on her labia. She looked down and saw Mel&#39;s face between her thighs. She braced herself, knowing what was about to happen. Sure enough, Mel began licking her dripping slit, probing her deeply to scoop out the woman&#39;s cum with her tongue. Heather slumped back down and tried her best to ignore the small crowd that had gathered around them. She could hear the clicks of various camera phones and wondered vaguely if it would be possible to see those photos back in the real world. She sucked her pacifier harder as Mel edged her closer to another orgasm. When it finally hit, she heard the women in the crowd start praising her. Calling her a good girl for cumming so well.<br />
<br />
When Mel had satisfied herself she carefully wiped Heather again before picking up the toy. Heather caught her eye and pleaded silently with her tormentor. Mel looked at the spiny vibrator in her hand, then up at Heather&#39;s pitiful expression. To Heather&#39;s relief, she sighed, put the toy away in the diaper bag, and pulled out a fresh diaper. But Mel got her back by pulling off her booties, folding them up in her onesie, and putting them into the diaper bag as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a warm day.&quot; Mel said, a little too brightly. &quot;Much too warm for a Little to be wearing more than a diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were murmurs of agreement. Many of the Littles running around the playground were already stripped and most of the rest were being rounded up by their caregivers. Mel hefted Heather off of the table and set her on her feet. Her knees were shaking, but she managed to stay upright. Mel held her for a moment, then leaned in to whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Are you tired already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel,&quot; Heather breathed, &quot;I&#39;m exhausted. I&#39;ve been used and abused for the past couple of days with very little sleep. And in case you didn&#39;t notice, the scenario skipped us from evening to morning when it started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering about that.&quot; Mel said, looking up at the blue sky. &quot;It also seems to have changed the weather. I believe it was supposed to rain today. Hold on, there might be something on the website about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel pulled out her phone and began tapping and swiping away. She seemed to find what she was looking for rather quickly and began reading. As she did, Heather watched the color slowly drain from her face. She tapped and swiped some more, but her movements seemed hurried. After a few more tense moments of reading she shoved her phone back into he pocket and scooped Heather up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Heather asked, trying to hide the panic in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get home right now.&quot; Mel said, the panic in hers only barely contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p>
