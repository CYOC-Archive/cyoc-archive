<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave tapped <b>[Expand]</b> and the Chronivac gave a gentle buzz—low, steady, and warm. The effect was immediate. The air around him thickened, like the humidity had a pulse. He blinked, adjusting to the shift in weight and pressure, even though nothing visible had changed.<br />
<br />
But his cock knew.<br />
<br />
It stirred in his jeans almost instantly. The aura was active. Broader. Deeper. Saturating every space he stepped into like scentless cologne.<br />
<br />
And the site responded.<br />
<br />
Luis kept glancing at him between tasks, his fingers drifting to the front of his pants every few minutes like something itched. Dan, stoic and quiet most days, lingered by the tool racks, watching Dave with eyes that didn’t match his usual poker face. Even Tim, the new hire, fumbled a nail gun when Dave passed too close.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t doing anything. Just existing.<br />
<br />
And it was enough.<br />
<br />
<b>New Targets Detected: 6<br />

<br />
Dave tried to focus. Really, he did. But every glance, every crotch adjustment, every stammered greeting sent a throb through his cock like someone was pressing a button. He was leaking by noon. His briefs were damp. He’d already edged himself twice in the port-a-john just to stay sane.<br />
<br />
It didn’t help.<br />
<br />
No matter what he did, the hunger wasn’t satisfied. Not like before.<br />
<br />
Sucking Matt off had scratched an itch—so deep it nearly broke him. But now? It felt like his body was looking for <i>something more</i>.<br />
<br />
He just didn’t know what. Yet.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Mark was acting different.<br />
<br />
That was the first real sign.<br />
<br />
The boss was never touchy-feely. Barely even conversational. But today he’d walked by three times, each pass slower than the last. The third time, he stopped a few feet from Dave, one hand casually resting near his belt.<br />
<br />
“You use new soap or something?” Mark asked, sniffing once.<br />
<br />
Dave looked up, startled. “Uh… nah.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s brow creased. “Smell like... something. Can’t place it.”<br />
<br />
The man didn’t wait for a reply. He scratched at his jaw and walked off.<br />
<br />
But his eyes had dropped to Dave’s crotch before he turned.<br />
<br />
And he hadn’t even tried to hide it.<br />
<br />
By second break, the air felt thick enough to cut.<br />
<br />
Dave’s cock wouldn’t settle. It kept twitching in his pants like it knew more cock was nearby. The aura must have activated some kind of feedback loop—his whole body was vibrating with awareness, keyed in on every bulge, every shift, every scent of male sweat around him.<br />
<br />
But one stood out more than the rest.<br />
<br />
Mark.<br />
<br />
He was shirtless now—broad, hairy, dense. His jeans were slung low, button still closed, but clearly under strain. He moved slower. Tighter. <br />
<br />
Like something was distracting him.<br />
<br />
Dave could barely hold it together. He caught up to him as the crew dispersed.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he said, casual but breathless.<br />
<br />
Mark turned, eyes narrowed. “What’s up?”<br />
<br />
Dave licked his lips. Fuck. The man smelled like heat and testosterone. Like something his body wanted to roll in. He took a step closer.<br />
<br />
“I, uh... I could help you blow off steam,” Dave offered, voice low. “If you’re wound up.”<br />
<br />
Mark didn’t reply at first. His eyes dragged across Dave’s face, down his chest, lower. And lower.<br />
<br />
Then his hand landed squarely on Dave’s hip. Heavy. Firm. Possessive.<br />
<br />
“You wanna suck me off?” he asked, already crowding into his space.<br />
<br />
Dave nodded, biting his lip. “Yeah.”<br />
<br />
Mark leaned in.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got a better idea.”<br />
<br />
Mark didn’t wait for a response.<br />
<br />
His hand gripped the back of Dave’s neck—tight enough to sting, firm enough to say this wasn’t a suggestion. He spun Dave around with a rough shove and started walking him toward the back of the trailer. Not a word. Just movement. Intention. The kind of silent command that bypassed thinking.<br />
<br />
Dave followed.<br />
<br />
His heart was hammering. His cock was hard.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t expected this.<br />
<br />
He just wanted a mouthful of cock. Wanted to taste. To serve. But the moment Mark touched him, something in his chest fluttered—deep and urgent. This wasn’t how he’d planned it, but his body wasn’t complaining.<br />
<br />
The door slammed shut behind them. The trailer was dim, quiet, the air still thick with dust and summer heat. Mark kicked a tool bag aside with his boot, then stepped up behind Dave, pressing their bodies together.<br />
<br />
Dave gasped. He could feel it.<br />
<br />
The bulge.<br />
<br />
Hot. Heavy. Hard.<br />
<br />
Pressed right between his cheeks through layers of denim.<br />
<br />
“You been walking around like you’re begging for something,” Mark growled into his ear, his breath hot. “And I think I know what.”<br />
<br />
Dave swallowed.<br />
“I was gonna suck you,” he mumbled.<br />
<br />
Mark’s hand slid down the front of his jeans. Gripped his cock.<br />
<br />
“You think this is about what you want?”<br />
<br />
Dave moaned.<br />
<br />
His knees nearly buckled as Mark tugged his fly open with his free hand and yanked his pants and underwear halfway down in one brutal motion. The cooler air rushed over his slick cock, his ass exposed, trembling.<br />
<br />
He still thought Mark might just push him to his knees.<br />
<br />
But then there was the unmistakable sound of another zipper.<br />
<br />
Then rustling.<br />
<br />
Then a hand pushing him forward—bending him over the workbench.<br />
<br />
Dave braced himself. Breath shallow. Eyes wide.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” he said, suddenly unsure. “I’ve never...”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Mark grunted behind him. “Then I’ll make it memorable.”<br />
<br />
The first press of cock against his hole was almost enough to make him cry out.<br />
<br />
Thick.<br />
Hot.<br />
Alive.<br />
<br />
Mark spat once, then again, then shoved.<br />
Dave groaned—loud, shaky, body clenching tight. It burned. Not sharp, not unbearable, but <i>insistent</i>, demanding. He gripped the edge of the bench like it was the only thing keeping him grounded.<br />
<br />
Mark didn’t stop. Didn’t wait.<br />
<br />
He pushed forward. Slow and steady, until the head popped past resistance and slid inside.<br />
<br />
Dave choked on his own breath. His cock jumped against his belly, untouched, dripping a slick smear across the wood grain.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck,” he whimpered. “Oh fuck, oh fuck—”<br />
<br />
Mark just growled behind him and kept going.<br />
<br />
Halfway in, Dave stopped thinking.<br />
<br />
His body short-circuited under the pressure. Every nerve lit up. His knees trembled. His vision blurred. Mark’s cock was thick, stretching him open in ways he’d never imagined. There was pain. Sure. But it was buried under layers of need.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t about gay or straight.<br />
<br />
It was about cock.<br />
Being filled by it.<br />
<i>Used</i> by it.<br />
<br />
Mark grabbed his waist with both hands and started to thrust. Shallow at first—grinding, stretching—then deeper. Harder. The sound of skin on skin filled the trailer. Dave’s moans grew louder, desperate, frantic.<br />
<br />
His cock throbbed, bouncing with each slap of Mark’s hips against his ass.<br />
<br />
He was going to come.<br />
He knew it.<br />
He couldn’t stop it.<br />
<br />
<b>New Pattern Detected: Penile Penetration<br />
Arousal Response: Maximal<br />
Orgasm Trigger: External Stimulation (Anal)<br />
Memory Link: Active</b><br />
<br />
The Chronivac buzzed in Dave’s pocket like a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
He barely registered it.<br />
<br />
Mark slammed forward, burying himself deep.<br />
<br />
And Dave <b>came</b>.<br />
<br />
No hands.<br />
No touch.<br />
Just cock buried deep in his ass.<br />
<br />
His whole body seized, muscles tightening as his orgasm erupted. Cum sprayed across the bench, hot and heavy, splattering wood and dripping down his thigh. He moaned like a broken thing, every pulse of his cock synced with the throbbing fullness inside him.<br />
<br />
Mark grunted behind him, hips jerking, cock twitching.<br />
<br />
Then he came too, deep and sudden, hands gripping Dave’s hips so hard it hurt.<br />
<br />
Hot ropes filled Dave’s insides, thick and messy. Mark didn’t pull out. Just stayed there, breathing hard, cock still twitching.<br />
<br />
Neither of them spoke. Dave was panting. Shaking.<br />
<br />
The smell of sweat and cum hung heavy in the air. His hole pulsed around the softening cock still inside him. His own dick twitched again—like it wasn’t done.<br />
<br />
Dave didn’t move. He Couldn’t.<br />
<br />
His arms were weak. His legs were worse. He was bent over the bench, still leaking from the last orgasm, his hole stretched wide around Mark’s slowly softening cock. Sweat dripped down his back. His breath came in shallow gasps, and his heart refused to settle.<br />
<br />
Mark still hadn’t pulled out.<br />
<br />
The man’s hands rested heavy on Dave’s hips, fingers flexing now and then, like he hadn’t quite come back to himself yet. His cock twitched one last time inside Dave—then slid free with a slow, slick withdrawal that made Dave shudder violently.<br />
<br />
Warmth trickled down his inner thigh.<br />
<br />
Cum.<br />
Inside him.<br />
<br />
He should have felt humiliated. Or confused. Or ashamed.<br />
<br />
He didn’t.<br />
He felt <i>full</i>.<br />
<br />
Satisfied in a way sucking hadn’t managed. Like something deeper than muscle had been fed.<br />
<br />
Mark stepped back and zipped up without a word. He didn’t make eye contact. Didn’t touch Dave again. Just grabbed his water bottle off the crate near the bench and left.<br />
<br />
The trailer door clicked shut.<br />
<br />
Dave stayed bent over for another full minute, chest heaving, arms trembling, cum cooling on his skin. His cock never fully softened.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac buzzed in his pocket again. He blinked blearily at the screen.<br />
<br />
<b>New Sexual Preference Logged: Receiving<br />

<br />
He didn’t even hesitate this time.<br />
<br />
<b>[YES]</b><br />
<br />
Another prompt faded in:<br />
<br />
<b>Would you like to mark this input type as “Preferred”?<br />
(Future sexual urges will bias toward receiving penetration when accessible.)</b><br />
<br />
He stared at the screen, mind sluggish, hole still tingling with the phantom fullness of Mark’s cock.<br />
<br />
His thumb hovered.<br />
He tapped <b>[YES]</b>.<br />
<br />
It was quiet when he finally stood upright, legs shaking.<br />
<br />
His ass ached, but it wasn’t pain.<br />
Not really.<br />
It was... a memory.<br />
A craving already forming in the space where Mark had been.<br />
<br />
He pulled his pants back up slowly, carefully. His briefs were soaked. His cheeks flushed. His cock was still slick with drying cum and twitching with lazy aftershocks.<br />
<br />
As he stepped back into the summer light, the app offered one last message:<br />
<br />
<i>Arousal Aura Calibrated to Penetration Trigger<br />
New Tag Added: “Breedable”</i><br />
<br />
Dave didn’t stop it.<br />
<br />
Didn’t question it.<br />
<br />
He was still leaking.<br />
<br />
And the workday wasn’t over.</p>
