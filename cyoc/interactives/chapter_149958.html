<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan woke up from a lovely dream feeling refreshed. &quot;I must have gone to bed early.&quot; He thought as he yawned. He looked up and became confused as to why he saw stuffed animals hanging over head, as well as some kind of cage around him. His vision cleared up and he was able to make out a baby mobile above a crib, which is when he remembered what had happened the night before. <br />
<br />
He looked down to see a baby girl&#39;s body in pink footsie pajamas. He wanted to groan but it came out as random, cute baby gurgle. This babble only lasted a bit as he suddenly felt something squish inside of his pants. He moved around a little and felt it move again. His eyes widened as he realized what must of happened and he turned red with embarrassment. His body&#39;s instincts kicked in and he began to cry for his, or rather her, mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh shhh it&#39;s okay honey!&quot; Janet whispered as she ran into Alan&#39;s nursery.<br />
<br />
Alan calmed down a little and managed to stop crying. He gestured down at his pants and Janet snickered. <br />
&quot;Sorry Alan I don&#39;t mean to make fun... It&#39;s just, I&#39;ve never been with a baby as young as you are right now that actually told me what was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked him up out of the crib and brought him over to the changing table. Alan still couldn&#39;t believe how small everything looked. It was like he was in a giant&#39;s house but he was stuck in a straight jacket with regards to movement. Janet began to hum as she changed Alan&#39;s diaper. Alan awkwardly looked away as he tried to ignore it but he was definitely grateful to have that over with.<br />
<br />
Janet gently placed him on the floor once the new diaper was on and then moved her hand to her bracelet. In an instant, Alan found himself shoot up as the room blurred before instantly changing back to its original design. Alan looked down and was relieved to see himself back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank God.&quot; He mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, did you learn your lesson?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I did, but don&#39;t you think that was a little harsh?&quot; Alan retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, maybe a little, but I wanted you two to know that I was serious about using magic as a punishment.&quot; She answered as she walked out of the room. <br />
<br />
Alan followed as he still had more questions, and a strong desire to talk after not being able to.<br />
&quot;Wait, how come when I turned back it was so much faster than when I turned into a baby?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry. I think the speed is based on how fast I will it to go. Last night I was a little irked when I changed you so it probably took longer because of that.&quot; Janet answered.<br />
<br />
The two arrived downstairs to find Steve drinking coffee while reading the paper and Megan eating a bowl of cereal. Alan sat down next to Megan and Janet sat next to Steve. Megan looked up and smirked at Alan.<br />
&quot;You have a good sleep lil&#39; sis?&quot; She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up Megan.&quot; Alan snapped back before pouring himself some orange juice. &quot;So, you guys said you were gonna make a magic limit right?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
Steve looked at Janet and then back at the kids.<br />
&quot;Yes, your mother and I talked about it this morning, and honestly....&quot; Steve began before he looked at Janet who smiled back. &quot;We decided on basically no limit!&quot; He finished.<br />
<br />
Megan&#39;s jaw dropped as Alan nearly choked on his orange juice. After both of them gathered their composure, they both began to ask many, many questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, why?&quot; &quot;I thought you&#39;d be stricter?&quot; &quot;Can I do like, WHATEVER whatever?&quot; &quot;No punishments anymore?&quot; They both asked over one another before Janet interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, woah&quot; She yelled. &quot;Settle down. &quot;Your father said basically no limit, not no limit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Steve continued. &quot;You both can use your magic, but only in smaller ways. You can change friends, teachers, bully, and so on at school for example, but nothing too crazy! Like, no changing how society functions or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also,&quot; Janet chimed in, &quot;you cannot leave everything as is and just go home. Whoever or whatever you change must be either temporary or be undone by the end of the day. On top of that, magic at home can only be used with our say so... is that all clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan and Megan were ecstatic. Both of them had been expecting them to never be able to use their magic again. Neither expected their parents to be so lenient with the rules. They could change anyone or anything outside the house as long as it was either temporary or undone, and they just had to not go overboard. The only thing that sucked was that they couldn&#39;t do it at home, but both of them figured they could probably get away with little things there and big things outside of the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; They both yelled as they hugged their parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! No problem, but don&#39;t you both have school to get ready for?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
They both nodded and ran off. Steve and Janet waited until they were gone before sitting down in relief. They both chuckled before they touched their respective magical artifacts. Almost in an instant, the two began to morph. Steve grew breasts as his hair grew out and his butt expanded, all while Janet received the opposite changes as she became more manly. Finally, Janet became Janet again and Steve became Steve again, as they had been switched the entire time. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was crazy.&quot; Steve chuckled. &quot;They had no idea that we were posing as the other!&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, although I think I prefer being other versions of myself than other people.&quot; Janet replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah me too, but it was still so... hot. Being someone else with no one being  the wiser make me freaking horny as hell.&quot; Steve whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too baby.&quot; Janet said as she leaned in for a kiss.</p>
