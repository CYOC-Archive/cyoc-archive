<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What no one in the group realized was that the Ring of Age had a sense of humor. Katie had suspected that it had a sentience to it, but not a sense of humor. The ring was becoming comfortable with the group and had been listening to Mika and Kumiko intently. Now it decided to have a bit of fun with them.<br />
<br />
As the girls lay out in the sun Mika began to feel slightly uncomfortable. Looking down at herself, she paused momentarily. &quot;Does my suit look okay,&quot; she asked. Katie and Kellie glanced over from their spots to gaze at Mika. &quot;You look fine Mika,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she muttered. &quot;It just feels tight around my boobs and my butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie gave eachother looks of concern. After everything the group had experienced, undersized clothing was an early warning sign of magical changes.<br />
<br />
Looking Mika over they were relieved that her face did not seem to be maturing, she still looked 16. Relieved they looked over the rest of Mika. Oddly they saw her breasts seemed a little fuller while her butt seemed slightly larger as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well good news bad news,&quot; Katie said. &quot;You don&#39;t look like your getting older.&quot; Mika sighed in relief. &quot;Okay so thats the good news, whats the bad news.&quot; Katie gave Mika a solemn look. &quot;Your boobs look fuller and your butt looks bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika&#39;s eyes went wide as she tried to spin around and look herself over. Hefting up her breasts she could see that they indeed appeared swollen a least a cup size bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay What The Hell,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;We didnt make any wishes. Kumiko did.!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it helps your boobs look great,&quot; Kellie said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping Kel,&quot; Mika grumbled.<br />
<br />
As Mika continued to look at her increased bust size she felt an odd feeling. Looking down her eyes bulged as a wet spot began to appear on her bikini. Quickly the teen peaked inside, to her horror she could see she was lactating.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie now jumped to their feet, quickly approaching their friend. Shocked they could see the spots where her breast milk was visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Mika,&quot; Katie exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t know whats going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika was near tears as she looked at her friends in a bewildered state. &quot;This doesn&#39;t make sense,&quot; Kellie whispered. &quot;I mean, its not like you could get pregnant with Claudia and your still a virgin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika blushed slightly as she looked at her friends. &quot;Ummm not really,&quot; she mumbled. Katie and Kellie looked at their friend in bewilderment, ttying to take in the information. &quot;Wait your not a virgin,&quot; Katie stammered.<br />
<br />
Mika sighed as she looked at her friends. &quot;Uh no,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I lost my virginity about three monthes ago at a party. We were drinking and one thing led to another and well......&quot; Mika trailed off as she now looked at the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was dumb,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I kinda regretted it afterwards. But that was three monthes ago. I know I&#39;m not pregnant. I took the test and even had my period since. This....this is something completely different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rubbed her temples as she now tried to think about what they could of said. &quot;Okay we know Kumiko is the only one that made a wish,&quot; she said as the girls nodded. &quot;Kumiko is worried about looking old. Mika you told her to be careful. So what are we missing?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the girls were now tryimg to figure out the problem, Kumiko was arriving for her lunch date with Cole. Taking one final look in the rear view mirror, she had to admit she looked great. Her face was smooth while her hair seemed to be glowing with energy. Exiting her car she noticed Cole was seated at an outside table. Dressed in a polo shirt with a pair of khakis she couldn&#39;t help being smitten by his appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you look great,&quot; he said causing Kumiko to blush slightly. &quot;Thanks you look pretty great too.&quot; As the two sat down Kumiko couldn&#39;t help but feel odd as she looked at Cole. The two had been on several dates already yet for some reason she felt nervous. Not only did it feel like it was their first date, she felt as if it was the first time she had ever been out on a date. Shaking her head she now began talking with Cole.<br />
<br />
As the waiter arrived to take their orders Kumiko smiled shyly. Ordering their meals the waiter now asked them if they wanted drinks. &quot;Applr juice,&quot; Kumiko said. &quot;I mean....red wine, red wine please.&quot; Cole gave Kumiko an odd look as he completed his drink order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumiko you feeling okay,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Kumiko nodded sheepishly trying to figurr out what was going on with her. &quot;Um yeah just nervous I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole looked her over critically trying to figure out what was going on. Glancing around quickly he now leaned close to Kumiko, causing the woman to blush. &quot;Have you bern messing around with that ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko turned several shades of red as she broke eye contact with Cole. &quot;Ummm maybe,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I.. I was a little freaked out about my age...so I kinda asked the girls to make me 30.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole shook his head as he smiled warmly at Kumiko. &quot;C&#39;mon Kumi,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Look I&#39;ve probably told you a dozen times so far that I like you for you. The age difference doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole continued to smile as he looked at Kumiko. All at once though she could see the smile fade from his face. &quot;Umm how old did you say you were now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;30 why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole frowned slightly as he looked at his date. &quot;I think you better call the girls,&quot; he said grimly. &quot;I&#39;d say your closer to 25 now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko&#39;s hand flew to her purse as she dugout her compact. Glancing in the mirror she gasped. Her face was much smoother and more youthful now. She looked like a woman in her mid twenties. Quickly she now reached for her cellphone to call Mika. After a few rings Mika answered. &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god,&quot; Kumiko sighed. &quot;Mom its me I&#39;m in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko paused as she registered what she had just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie did you just call me mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just call me sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Mika now gaped on either side of the phone. The realization was begining to set in. Mika was becoming Kumikos mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is not good,&quot; Mika answered. &quot;Honey...I mean Kumiko I need you to get home now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko blushed and hung her head, feeling like a child being scolded. &quot;Okay mom..I mean Mika I&#39;m coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two exchanged goodbyes as Kumiko now looked at Cole. &quot;Ugh Cole,&quot; she whispered, slightly embarassed. &quot;I...ugh...I kinda have to run. I....I think I made a big mistake and I kinda need to fix it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole nodded as he now left $40 in the table hustling his slowly regressing date to the car. Kumiko buried her face in her hand, slightly embarassed as Cole smiled. &quot;Well Kumi,&quot; he smirked. &quot;You certainly kmow how to keep the relationship interesting.&quot;</p>
