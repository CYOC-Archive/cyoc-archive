<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If happiness and pleasure were a puddle, what Eric was experiencing was an ocean. Eric groaned and moaned in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you put in that soup but I feel wonderful,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
Mary was on top of Eric in a moment, her sweet face in a smile that drove Eric insane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mary,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
Mary started undoing the buttons on Eric's shirt. Once she had his shirt off, soft fur on her belly only increased his pleasure when she lay down on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy it Eric, come on you know you wana,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
Light orange fur was starting to cover Eric's normally smooth chest. He gasped as pleasure much like an orgasm raked his body.<br />
<br />
Mary's scent far more appealing. Once pleasant, it now threatened to away what Eric felt was a beast within him. Not that Eric minded of course.<br />
<br />
Eric's attraction to her increased exponentially. Rather then  someone with a beloved girlfriend he could never couple with that enjoyed letting her sit on his shoulder, sometimes called pumpkin and always wished he could be more to her, he now was starting to see her as a potential mother for his children.<br />
<br />
The monster or perhaps gentleman within Eric was starting to demand Eric show Mary his true feelings. Eric would have questioned it if not for the fact that it seemed to be his own feelings. Something else was simply giving them some extra motivation.<br />
<br />
The world seemed to grow. Eric's pants were now far too large. Mary jumped of off his chest, undid Eric's belt (which was now several notches too loose despite being tight moments earlier) and pulled his pants down legs that orange fur was making its way over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, what's happening to me?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you know, honey,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I turning into an...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was on top of Eric and kissing what were lips over a face that was growing to look more like Mary's by the second before Eric could finish his question.<br />
<br />
Eric's mouth, ears and face in general reformed as Mary kissed him. Orange fur soon ensured that he'd never need to shave again. His ears grew longer, giving him better hearing. A shrinking body made his size more perfect for her by the second.<br />
<br />
Mary released her kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you're turning into an ottsel! Isn't that great! Now we can really be together forever!&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
Eric saw that indeed, Mary was getting larger. He felt a tingle at the base of his spine. An emerging tail pushed underwear now far too big for him down legs that orange fur had now covered in a soft coat. Mary was quick to dash down Eric's legs (a trip that was now far shorter), remove his underwear and then his socks. She rubbed his feet to help encourage his footpads to form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I'm all naked,&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naked? You have your fur sweetheart. And doesn't it just feel so wonderful?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Eric grinned and relaxed. &quot;It's feels -- it feels wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary jumped over Eric as further shrinking had him only a little larger then she. From his point of view, Mary was now huge, smelled more wonderful then ever before and was desirable on a level so strong that Eric could barley contain himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary I -- I'm an ottsel like you!&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
Mary was hugging Eric and pressing her warm body against his. His resistance was fading and indeed, he was finally capable of to doing what he'd wished he could for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how is this possible?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares how it's possible! We can be one now!&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
Eric put his arms around Mary, kissed her and looked into her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, I love you and I want you here and now,&quot; Eric said. &quot;I've never felt desire like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary grinned. &quot;I love you too baby. And, don't hold back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric put his arms around Mary, rolled her around and looked into her arms. He wanted more then anything at that moment. For Eric, the only thing in the world that mattered was making Mary happy.<br />
<br />
He pressed into her, making both scream in pleasure. Her screams only encouraged him to continue. Emerging instinct guided him but his love for Mary was what made him want to use that instinctual knowledge to pleasure her.<br />
<br />
Ah, but don't fret. For if you think that this was only pleasurable for Mary, it was just as much so for Eric. For both, it was a wonderful act. The other's screams of joy only made them feel happier and more excited, driving them deeper into the act.<br />
<br />
Mary, guided by instinct as well, knew just how to gyrate her hips in a way that would give maximum pleasure.<br />
<br />
Both were growing sweaty and breathing deeply as their little hearts raced.<br />
<br />
The act lasted for several more minutes, the band sining songs that had the crowed cheering in delight.<br />
<br />
When the climax came, it brought down the house.<br />
<br />
Eric withdrew from Mary, rolled off and to the side of her. Both bathed in the afterglow as they held hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was wonderful,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best I've ever had,&quot; Eric said. &quot;I don't know how you made this possible but thank you. Please tell me it's going to last.&quot;</p>
