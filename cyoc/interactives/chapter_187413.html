<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stood there for a moment looking between Luna and her mother. A part of you wanted to just go and hug Luna given the potential for Luna being driven to worry again over things that related to the Wolf Hunters. From what the head of the registry office at City Hall had said to Kellie, the Wolf Hunters weren&#39;t in town yet, but were talking about coming to town. That then confirmed the fears of violence that often followed the Wolf Hunters. They might be coming to town only to protest, and in theory any werewolf, even a MILF-wolf, would be strong enough to kill one of the Wolf Hunters in a fight, but that still assumed that the Wolf Hunter wouldn&#39;t have a gun and would give the werewolf a &quot;chance.&quot; That then likely raised Luna&#39;s likely worries because of the fact that if they were violent, the Wolf Hunters wouldn&#39;t play fair.<br />
<br />
However, there was also something that puzzled you with something that Kellie had said. That this &quot;girls&#39; night&quot; for Kellie, Roxie, and these friends from out of town wouldn&#39;t be in their MILF-wolf forms and that they&#39;d leave at eight and &quot;didn&#39;t know&quot; when they&#39;d get back. That puzzled you and your mind seemed to wrestle with that and you raised your hand, sort of like a student in a classroom trying to get the teacher&#39;s attention. Eventually Roxie noticed and addressed you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to raise your hand to ask for attention, Nicki,&quot; Roxie spoke kindly, &quot;If you have something to say... you&#39;re more than free to go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
You straightened yourself up a bit as you and Luna followed them into the kitchen where you then placed the folder that you&#39;d used to carry your identification in back into the fireproof box that your father and stepmother had loaned you the previous night. As you closed the lid down you looked over to Kellie and Roxie as they moved around the modest breakfast table that was there in the middle of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say this girl&#39;s night won&#39;t involve your MILF-wolf forms,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;but wasn&#39;t last night the FIRST night of the full moon? Wouldn&#39;t you HAVE to transform tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Roxie glanced to each other as they sat down and you and Luna sat down opposite them. They then looked to Luna, whom you noted was also looking to you. You guessed this was going to lead into some other lessons about lycanthropy and the MILF-wolf strain in particular. The silence was eerie as you had the sense that Luna knew some things that you didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dear,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;it&#39;s just something that often comes up with new werewolves of all kinds. While Roxie and I being MILF-wolves was a surprise... many things from normal werewolves does apply to us as well. Shoot, even the werewolf that bit me had to go over some of these sorts of things with Roxie and I... and over time, we explained them to Luna, so that she&#39;d be ready. Now... it&#39;s our turn to explain them to you. As a lot of the high school classes and movies on werewolves and more recently MILF-wolves are more like beginner&#39;s guides to help people avoid unnecessary trouble and allow us to live alongside people with no problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I asked Luna on when we have to change and if there were other triggers,&quot; you commented, your confusion at the main point still obvious in your voice, &quot;she said that we&#39;d have to change on the nights of the full moon, which are three nights a month. Other than that, while there can be other triggers, they often relate to desire and would likely require concentration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Luna was absolutely right in that answer,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;but that point desire and &quot;other triggers&quot; can also go both ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with all the movies that have been made about werewolves,&quot; Kellie added, &quot;even the biographical pick on Jean Chastel... &quot;the Brotherhood of the Beast&quot; gets some of the details wrong in that werewolves must turn immediately when the sun sets on the night of the full moon. That&#39;s common with new werewolves who may have only just had their first transformation, but it isn&#39;t quite the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the transformation can be resisted during the full moon?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up until around ten to eleven thirty PM and by a werewolf with good self-determination and control,&quot; Kellie nodded, &quot;the same thing that let Jean Chastel change during the day to finally kill the &quot;Beast of Gévaudan.&quot; In his case it was forcing the change outside of the full moon. In other cases resisting it is essentially the same thing, just in the other direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time and with practice, you and Luna will perfect the same abilities,&quot; Roxie nodded, &quot;but that will take time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be taxing... as Luna also said that the transformation does consume energy?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does...&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;and thankfully these friends are also MILF-wolves... they just happened to move out of town a few months after becoming MILF-wolves. So, things SHOULD be fine with them. And as such, if it gets to a point where we&#39;d need to come back... we&#39;d bring them back here before the point where we can&#39;t resist the change anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And is part of why new werewolves take some time to fully learn this,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;Kellie and I have learned this and that will give us the time to have a bit of a girl&#39;s night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you commented, and glanced to Luna for a moment, &quot;well... I suppose that makes sense with regard to how well one can deal or cope with where those other triggers intersect with the main trigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Roxie both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But still... what about this issue with the Wolf Hunters?&quot; you asked, &quot;if they&#39;re also MILF-wolves... wouldn&#39;t it be easier just to have them as guests here rather than going out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s possible...&quot; Kellie said slowly, &quot;but like I said, they&#39;re from out of town and wouldn&#39;t likely know much about the present &quot;threat&quot; the Wolf Hunters pose to our town... if they lived in town, we would have told them last night... but they don&#39;t and this was something scheduled before Luna had her first transformation and thus before your stepmom warned you of them. Thus the plans for the evening were made long in advance. They&#39;re not something we can get out of. And while we don&#39;t know exactly when they&#39;ll be ready to leave or turn in for the night, it WILL be before our ability to resist transforming wears out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if need be, we can make sure to end the activities well before then,&quot; Roxie spoke, &quot;if only to put you and Luna at ease.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be good,&quot; Luna spoke up after a moment, &quot;Nicki and I could even set something up if they want to stay longer so that you and they can come back here... transform and be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you dear,&quot; Roxie spoke, &quot;and we may consider that, but that will also have to wait until after we go out.&quot;</p>
