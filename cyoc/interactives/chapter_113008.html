<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You will have the full cooperation of the Elders&#39; Council,&quot; Tachibana no Akane told everyone gathered round her, &quot;but Daisuke, while I do not question your logic, I hope you are wrong about Leon Talbot. With the retirement of Martin Stovall&#39;s predecessor, he is the second most senior Elder on the Council now after myself, and a long time friend of mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not say he will, just that we would be ill advised not to be prepared otherwise,&quot; replied Daisuke.<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; said Tachibana, bowing her head in acknowledgement of her grandson&#39;s wisdom. Then she turned to a servant and asked in Japanese, &quot;Where are my honored guests right now Yvette*?&quot;<br />
&quot;Out,&quot; responded the were-vixen maid, knowing her mistress referred to the were-white tigers that had been staying at the estate for almost a year now.<br />
&quot;When they return, please tell them I request the honor of their presence,&quot; said Tachibana, before seeing her guests out.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Martin Stovall, with suitcase in hand, was about to enter his wife&#39;s hospital room, when Doctor Tora Tachibana came out.<br />
&quot;Oh, excuse me,&quot; said Martin, not wanting to bump into the man.<br />
&quot;No problem, but since you are here, I shall tell you what I have already informed your wife,&quot; said the doctor, taking Martin aside.<br />
&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; asked a worried husband and new father.<br />
&quot;Yes. Both mother and twins are doing fine. It&#39;s just that normally we like to give new mothers a full 24 hours of monitored rest before we discharge them, but since your wife had twins, we&#39;ll be keeping her an extra day so we will not be releasing Mrs. Stovall and the babies before Monday morning,&quot; explained Tora. &quot;Will that be a problem?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Not at all,&quot; answered Martin, happy everything was all right. &quot;Can I see her now?&quot;<br />
&quot;In a moment, but don&#39;t be surprised if she falls asleep on you. Melissa does need her rest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Understood.&quot;<br />
&quot;By the way, if I may ask,&quot; began Tora politely, &quot;how are things concerning your other daughter?&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie chose her path a long time ago, and now she must swim it wherever it leads,&quot; answered Martin flatly.<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Tora, before going on about his rounds.<br />
<br />
With that, Martin walked in to his wife&#39;s hospital room and smiled as Melissa had a child cradled in each arm, while the twins were hungrily nursing.<br />
&quot;Want me to take one?&quot; he asked, putting her suitcase down.<br />
&quot;Only if you have a bottle of formula handy. Otherwise...&quot; said Melissa, looking down at her babies eating.<br />
&quot;Afraid not. Should I go ask for one?&quot; he wondered.<br />
&quot;No. The nurse said that she&#39;d be back in a couple of minutes to take them so I can nap,&quot; replied Melissa, smiling at him. &quot;Despite all the physical and emotional stress, it was worth it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Our family,&quot; commented Martin, before kissing her.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Evan Lawson and his father were anxiously working within his house, putting the final touches on the nursery before his wife and new son came home tomorrow, when his cellphone chimed an incoming text message.<br />
Considering both men were currently in their werewolf fursonas, Evan had to go out into the hallway to retrieve his phone from his discarded clothing, but Mike Lawson could see his son wasn&#39;t happy as Evan came back into the room.<br />
&quot;I may need more of your help in the coming days, dad,&quot; began Evan, as he held up the phone so Mike could see the message.<br />
It was from Daisuke Tachibana and said WE ARE NEEDED.<br />
&quot;Sure. Trouble at work?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of, but Daisuke wouldn&#39;t call me while I&#39;m on paternity leave unless it was important,&quot; replied his son, while calling his employer to find out what was going on.<br />
<br />
CONCURRENTLY...<br />
Ben Twist, in his human form between the fact the place wasn&#39;t open yet and he never successfully mastered using a pen in his werewolf fursona; was sitting within the closed confines of GRRRRRRR... the downtown restaurant that catered exclusively to the weres of Moon Lake, doing his best trying to fill out his new employment forms when he heard the owner cry out, &quot;The bitch can&#39;t do this to us!&quot;<br />
Even without his keen lupine hearing, there was no mistaking the owner stomping angrily towards him and asking, &quot;What does your mother think she&#39;s up to?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ben asked innocently, even as the head waitress was trying to calm her boss down.<br />
&quot;I complied with staying closed until noon today, even though we should of opened at 11, but now she&#39;s wanting me to stay closed until Wednesday morning because of possible trouble from some out of town mobsters,&quot; growled the Arctic werefox angrily, throwing the letter on the table in front of Ben.<br />
As Ben picked up the formal letter and read it for himself, the owner added, &quot;Do you know how much money this place makes on a weekend? Let alone a <i>holiday</i> weekend?&quot;<br />
&quot;First off,&quot; began Ben, trying to remain calm, &quot;she&#39;s only <i>requesting</i> that you remain closed. It isn&#39;t an order.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet,&quot; snapped the owner.<br />
&quot;Secondly, the mayor, regardless of who it might be, is only doing what&#39;s best for the good of the town. From what I hear, these Parkers are very bad news, and the last thing anyone wants is for our secrets to get out,&quot; explained Ben.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll agree with that last part, but I&#39;d lose my shirt if I stay closed until Wednesday, provided I was wearing one right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m supposed to have a pack meeting tomorrow night, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it gets canceled now. Would you deny the request if Tachibana no Akane made it?&quot; wondered Ben out loud, which stopped the werefox from saying anything else.<br />
There was an eerie silence in the room until the Arctic werefox spoke again. &quot;No. I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; he replied, as the head waitress found herself able to breathe again, not realizing she had tensed and was holding her breath until then. &quot;I&#39;ll stay closed until Wednesday morning, unless ordered otherwise. But until this crisis is over, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to afford to hire any additional help,&quot; he added coldly.<br />
&quot;I understand. You know how to reach me if the job&#39;s still available then,&quot; said Ben, leaving the forms unfinished on the table as he got up and left the restaurant.<br />
<br />
But as Ben started walking to the Town Hall, he thought angrily to himself, <i>You certainly wouldn&#39;t call your beloved Skulk leader a bitch behind her back you jerk!</i><br />
