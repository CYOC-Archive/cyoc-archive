<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The police were in the process of releasing Nikola when the lawyer who worked for the Russians showed up at the station. Nikola was relieved as that meant Marco had done as she had told him. Hopefully a team of &quot;Connections&quot; were assembling. She planned to get them to question any petty thieves in the town. It was essential that she regained possession of the medallion. <br />
<br />
The police offered to search for &#39;Nikola Fedorov&#39; as he had apparently disappeared. The girl who had claimed she was his daughter (really Nikola) dissuaded them. &quot;My Papa would have gone to see his countrymen&quot;. She also turned down an offer to have a lift back to the hospital. &quot;It&#39;s fine. Papa&#39;s lawyer will take me to him&quot; They released her into the lawyers hands<br />
<br />
The lawyer was called Mike, he wasn&#39;t Russian but Nikola retained him to deal with petty local matters. Nikola owned two nightclubs in town and hence had a local team. She trusted the man but not enough to enlighten him on her current transgendered predicament. She continued to pretend she was Ruby, stepdaughter of Nikola Fedorov. Once outside she instructed him to take her to see Alexei, Nikola&#39;s local manager. Mike drove her to one of the nightclubs.<br />
<br />
Alexei was waiting for her &quot;Hello Ruby. We haven&#39;t met but I know your parents very well. I am Alexei. I manage your father&#39;s interests in this town. I didn&#39;t know he was visiting us today. I am alarmed to hear that he has gone missing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is not in danger but is temporarily unable to show his face. He has authorised me to take control in his absence. I need all available men to begin questioning every petty thief in town. We need to find out who took Papa&#39;s briefcase from his vehicle, a blue Porsche outside the hospital&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm! You are a quite assertive little lady. However I not in the habit of taking orders from teenage pindos. And Marco, who in the absence of your Papa runs the show, has already told me what I have to do&quot; He clicked his fingers and a woman walked in. She was in heels and a revealing dress. Nikola assumed she was one of the clubs resident &#39;Dancers&#39;. &quot;You young lady are to be kept safe until the crisis is averted. Marco has told me I am to keep you safe. He will no doubt see you home after whatever your Papa lost is located. Meanwhile Ana will look after you. Ana is newly arrived in this country and would no doubt like to practice her English with you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to give the necklace to me once it is located&quot; Nikola pleaded with Alexei<br />
<br />
&quot;What we do with the necklace is up to Marco. Take her Ana. Make sure she doesn&#39;t do a runner. I need to make a few calls&quot; Alexei waved Nikola and the woman away.<br />
<br />
Nikola found herself gripped by the woman tightly and led through a door. They walked through the public area of the club into what Nikola realised was the stripper&#39;s dressing room. <br />
<br />
&quot;You new girl?&quot; Ana asked in a very strong St Petersburg accent. <br />
<br />
Nikola decided to reply in Russian. However to her dismay she had difficulty finding the words. She seemed to have inherited the real Ruby&#39;s lack of Russian language skills. &quot;I can&#39;t find the words in Russian. How much English do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Da Angliyskiy not ghoot. Need Angliysk&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the bosses daughter&quot; Nikola decided to maintain the charade that she was Ruby. &quot;You need to help me. You will be rewarded&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman looked confused &quot;Angliysk no Ghoot. I vind you zum odezhda&quot;<br />
<br />
This was going to be difficult. Nikola indicated that she did not understand. Where had her native language gone? She gestured with her hands &quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;odevat&#39;sya.....dres&quot; she gestured to Nikola and pointed at a wardrobe. Eventually she made Nikola understand. She opened the wardrobe and pointed at the clothes inside &quot;For youz&quot;<br />
<br />
That was actually a good idea. Nikola would be less conspicuous if she wasn&#39;t wearing a expensive male suit, way too big for her. If she wanted to escape she guessed she needed to blend in. She nodded understanding and began to unbutton her shirt.<br />
<br />
Ana must have seen that Nikola wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. The first item she handed the girl was a lacy black bra. Nikola took the item with bewilderment. She supposed it made sense. If she was the real Ruby she would wear the bra without hesitation. Nikola had been very aware of how her breasts wobbled as she moved and how that attracted unwanted male attention. Her understanding was that a bra would lessen that movement.  She removed the shirt and quickly tried to put on the bra. Fortunately it was a bra that did up at the front with a simple clip. She was rather proud to have put the item on without a mishap.<br />
<br />
Now Ana was holding out a pair of panties that matched the bra. Nikola just had to go with the flow. Her pants and her boxers came off and the tiny black lacy panties took their place. Nikola tried to avoid looking at her sex. Not wanting to remain semi-naked she quickly accepted the first shirt Ana handed her. It was also black and lacy and had short sleeves. It buttoned up the at the back so Ana had to help her. Only when the item was on did Nikola realise how short it was. Her belly button was not covered. <br />
<br />
It seemed that a black skirt went with the top. Aware of the the skimpy panties barely covering her crotch she accepted that as well, allowing Ana to wrap it around her waist and do it up at the back. Once it was on her Nikola saw it was shiny, black, form fitting and either real or imitation leather.<br />
<br />
&#39;Isk Ghoot&quot; said Ana as she admired the teenager. &quot;Youse pretty girl. Shooze?</p>
