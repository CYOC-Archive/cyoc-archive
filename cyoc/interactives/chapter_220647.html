<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two looked around for an exit, Matt suddenly felt himself becoming thirsty.  Really thirsty. Even though he&#39;d just downed his water bottle before making his trek to the dorms, he couldn&#39;t help but year for something to sate his thirst. Mouth drying , he found himself distracted from his search for an exit and suddenly more interested in finding something to drink. <br />
<br />
Dropping his backpack to the floor, he knelt and began to rummage, tossing papers aside as he searched for his water bottle. Finding it, he quickly opened it and drained the contents into his mouth. As the water hit his tongue, however, a sense of  revulsion hit . For some reason the empty wetness of the water was almost nauseating. Spitting the disgusting contents, he dropped the bottle  to the floor with a loud <i>clink</i> that echoed through the empty room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not worth collecting&quot; he murmured , as his tongue desperately tried to moisten his mouth. When it hit his teeth, he paused. He rubbed his tongue against them, only to feel them <i>give</i>. Something was off. <br />
<br />
It was only at that moment; he realized his odd choice of words. &quot;Collecting?&quot; he said aloud, his words ever so slightly distorted as his teeth softened further in his shifting mouth. &quot;And why did that water taste so...horrible?&quot; Despite his confusion, however, the idea of   <i>collecting liquids </i> hung in his thoughts, as if suspended in his brain by some unknown force. His tongue absently licked his dry mouth, at the idea, the feel of his once hard enamel giving way even more shocking enough to pull him out of his head and back into reality. <br />
<br />
Prodding his teeth again, he found they had taken on a pliant rubbery feel, a change complimented by the strange new flavor that suddenly seemed to emerge.  The flavor of rubber. Hands rushing to his mouth, he was shocked to find his lips had also changed. Equally rubbery and almost inflated into a protruding shape, he shivered as his fingers traced the non-biological material forming on his face. Pressing against the rubber with a big more force, he was surprised as the material pushed inward against his teeth. This simple pressure seemed to force his teeth and lips against each other, causing the rubbery structures to unexpectedly merge.  His finger recoiled, the rubber bounced back along with it. The shape the rubber now took, however, was different. Now, his lips were permanently open, formed into a flexible O-ring.<br />
<br />
<i> My nozzle </i> Came a thought that, while unbidden, seemed to rest with odd comfort in his mind. There was an oddly satisfying certainty in the term that contrasted with the stress of his unquenchable thirst and transformation. <br />
<br />
Despite that comfort, however his thirst did indeed remain and was getting even worse. <i> Need to collect…something…not water, something…richer, thicker </i> His mind struggled to comprehend, desperately trying to figure out what he needed. <br />
<br />
What his mind did know - was that he needed it now. He needed help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, dude we need to get out of here. This place-its--its changing me somehow&quot; He moaned, somewhat surprised he was still able to work the rubber O-ring his lips had become to form words. Adjusting himself, he turned to look up towards Luke who was over by the far wall searching for some sort of seam or exit in the wall. &quot;I&#39;m so fucking thirsty...I need...I need to collec- er I need something to drink!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt blushed as that word &#39;collect&#39; snuck into his words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh ,,,sure, dude.” Luke called back. Absently, he adjusted his crotch. Since they’d entered the room his pants seemed to be riding up on him. They had fit perfectly before, but something…perhaps the stress or sweat of the room….was making them feel constricting. <br />
<br />
“Fuck dude, so….so thirsty.” He heard Matt moan again. <br />
<br />
 Matt’s repeated cries, and apparent stress, gave Luke a deep sense of unease . Sure, it was stressful that they were trapped, but Matt was acting so ...weird. Luke&#39;s  hand again absently adjusted his crotch, the denim of his pants even tighter than before.  “Are you going to be able to keep it together.” Luke replied, as he finally turned from his search to face Matt.<br />
<br />
 His eyebrows raised as he took in the other boy. Collapsed on the floor next to the strewn about contents of Matt&#39;s backpack was a form changed from what Luke recognized from before. Having since merged with Matt’s nose, the thick O-ring now dominated the center of Matt&#39;s face. The ring repeatedly opened and closed, as if trying to will some sort of liquid spout from the air  to  nurse from. On the sides of Matt’s head, Luke found more changes. Matt&#39;s ears had seemingly melted into his skin. While the holes remained, left behind was a sleek metallic sheen that seemed to be slowly creeping over the skin on the sides of his lead. <br />
<br />
“What-uh f-” Luke stammered, unable to comprehend what he was looking at. &quot;Jesus Mat. The fu-&quot; his words gradually drifted off, dying on his lips. Again, Luke adjusted his crotch. While at first appalled by Matt’s transformation, the longer Luke stared the longer those thick rubbery lips seemed to...call to him. <br />
<br />
 A flush crossed his cheeks. Against his already straining pants he felt his cock begin to stiffen.  Luke was the furthest thing from gay, yet his eyes were transfixed by the soft rubber of Matt’s lips. They seemed so soft, gentle. His hand clenched and he shook his head, trying to rid his mind of these bizarre thoughts. <br />
<br />
“The fuck, why am I so turned on” Luke groaned, pausing briefly as he realized he’d said the words aloud. Matt’s attention shifted at the comment as he looked up towards Luke. While his thirst continued to dominate his thoughts, Luke’s admission of need seemed to distract.  Matt had always been straight, and surely not attracted to Luke, yet he couldn’t help but now he couldn&#39;t help but take in Luke&#39;s desirable form. It didn’t take long before Matt’s eyes fell to Luke straining cock and the unnaturally sizeable bulge straining against Luke’s pants - the source of Luke’s discomfort. <br />
<br />
Something about the image filled Matt with unique excitement. Mindlessly, he smacked his nozzle lips, creating a soft inhuman popping noise. He couldn’t piece together why, but was as if he’d finally found what he needed. Between his legs, his cock twitched. <br />
<br />
Luke blinked, trying to mentally force away his desire for matt. Thoughtlessly, he licked his upper lip, a thickened tongue emerged and stretched over his nose. Feeling the ach of his cock, Luke looked down. As expected, a sizable tent was pressing against the front. Unexpected, however, was the sizeable bulge that pressed lewdly against the fabric from below. <br />
<br />
“Fuck..” He muttered, his mind increasingly muddled as the stress of the changes and his  desire fought against calm, rational thought. That desire, however, seemed to be quickly changing nature. Around his crotch he was starting to feel a growing fullness mixing with his lust. Starting in his balls, he found the sensation both spreading and growing in intensity. Equal pressure could soon be felt in his lower stomach, and oddly, seemed to well up from just under his cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck I&#39;m so full&quot; Luke murmured, not quite realizing the odd choice of words. Without thought, his hands slowly began tracing his pressured lower belly. The oddly pliant skin was tantalizingly sensitive, willing further prodding. The pleasurable tingles soon carried his fingers further down his legs, bringing his hand to rest on his package. The bulge felt full, and heavy in his hands - an unexpectedly satisfying sensation that caused his cock to twitch. Timidly, he gave it a squeeze - causing the bulge to inflate further in his grasp. Once more, his inhumanly thick tongue lashed against his upper lip. The confused mix of pleasure and pressure assaulting Luke’s brain was increasingly characterized less by the typical hormone charge lust he was used to, but a yearning desire to find  ‘release’ for this strange fullness he felt. <br />
<br />
Crotch at its limit, Luke slowly made his way toward the couch. <br />
<br />
“So full...gotta sit” he muttered as he trudged forward “gotta…find release.” Casually, his pants fell to the floor discarded in a trail with the rest of his clothes. With each step, two keratinous growths began to emerge from his forehead, stretching upwards as they formed into a pair of animalistic horns. Reaching his destination, Luke fell against plush cushions. He smiled dully at the comfort while his legs fell open, putting his package on full display. <br />
<br />
Matt watched on, confused yet intrigued by Luke’s changes. Between the man’s legs rested a sack somewhat larger than a softball.  No longer defined by a pair of balls, the shape of the sack was inflated into a round heft that reminded Matt of a full water balloon. Luke&#39;s hand drifted to his cock, giving it a slight squeeze as a dull smile crossed his face. While increasingly content, an increasingly distant part of Luke’s mind noted his cock and balls were losing the tannish tint of his skin in favor of a lighter pink. <br />
<br />
Matt meanwhile couldn’t help but smack his needy nozzle at Luke’s display. Just as Luke’s desires had triggered an intense lust, Matt now sported a stark tent - one somewhat longer and wider than before - between his legs. On his head, the metallic sheen slowly met his hairline. Inch by inch, Matt’s blond hair slowly seemed to melt, losing its color and fusing with the streamlined gloss of the transforming skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck moooreee&quot; Matt heard Luke moan in pleasure as he began to kneed his cock while the other cradled the impressive girth of his growing sack, the weight straining against his form. As if to compensate, Luke’s thin body seemed to thicken slightly. A new mix of muscle and fat the rail thin boy had never felt before flowed over his legs. He felt a strength he’d never experienced - a satisfying feeling that  distracted him from the oddly curvy look his lower body had taken on. <br />
<br />
Matt shook his head, Luke&#39;s increasingly dramatic changes forcing a burst of clarity in the muddle of his thoughts and need. &quot;The fuck is happening to us&quot; he muttered quietly, the words increasingly hard to form in his mouth. As if protesting his continued ability to speak, Matt’s tongue slowly melted into his lower jaw, the inside of his mouth shifting into the same metal crossing his head. Soon his mouth was a tapered, uniform metallic tunnel that slowly worked its way down his throat, the metal transforming and smoothing his tonsils and esophagus as it proceeded down towards his stomach.<br />
<br />
Matt heard his stomach audibly groan as the acid melted away, leaving a completely empty chamber that begged to be filled. Unsure what to do, Matt’s eyes once more shifted to Luke, who had since abandoned his cock. Luke was awash in strange, yet amazing sensations as his hands worked a pair of growths that were slowly emerging from the base of his sack.<br />
<br />
“Murooo” He bellowed, “ feels like my cock” His eyes were glazed in enjoyment. <br />
<br />
<i> What is happening </i> Matt wondered  as his partner basked in his changing form. As Matt watched Luke stroking the lengthening tubes extending from the bulbous mound emerging from his lower body, he couldn’t help but shift in increasing excitement. Matt’s eye danced around the pinkish mass while his cock repeatedly twitched in want. Wincing slightly, Matt briefly tried to wrest himself away from Luke, but as soon as he opened his eyes again, he couldn’t help but grin in admiration of the impressive sight before him. <br />
<br />
<i> He has an udder…</i> came a distant thought. By now Luke&#39;s balls had inflated to roughly the size of a basketball  and adored by several thick, four inch growths, two of which Luke kneaded desperately - trying to relieve the pressure of the milk he carried inside. His balls had long since pulled up against his lower stomach, expending the udder’s territory upwards and merging with his lower stomach. Overtaken by the udders upward advance,  what was once Luke&#39;s long since abandoned cock seemed to deflate. The mushroom head slowly sunk into the pinkish flesh as the once-hard erection settled into the soft limpness of its counterparts below. <br />
<br />
<i> Milk </i> Matt thought. Without further consider he began to crawl across the floor, drawn to the fullness of the udder. With each inch, the pull of his need seemed to physically  pull Matt&#39;s face forward.  The O-ring on his face slowly stretched forming into the shaft of a tapered tube that quickly took on the metallic sheen that now dominated Matt&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Murooooo&quot; Luke called as his eyes took in the nozzle like figure advancing towards him. His udder was near its breaking point.  Once more he licked his face, his long thick tongue crossing an increasingly black and bovine nose. Down his thickened thighs a mix of white and black hairs slowly pressed from Luke&#39;s skin. <br />
<br />
Matt’s nozzle stretched towards the udder, trying to reach out to his target. By now his head had streamlined, the once roundish shape now completely metallic, flatter, and tapered, crowned by the almost animalistic look of hiss nozzle-muzzle. <br />
<br />
<i> Milk. Need to Collect.  </i> Matt’s erection had long since shifted. Against the fabric of his shorts, pressed a stiff rounded head - a shape matching the nozzle on Matt’s face. Even still, the stiff metallic body twitched in need, its sensitive rubber head tingling with need as it shifted against the textured fabric. <br />
<br />
</i> So full </i>  Matt was now just feet from Luke, his muzzy mind enamored by his friend&#39;s sizable  - and milk filled -udder. <br />
<br />
Luke looked down at Matt, tongue lick his bovine nostrils once more.  “Muroooo” He bellowed, his hands desperately toyed with his udder. “Fucking finally” he swore under his breath. Standing, the weight of his legs caused Luke&#39;s ankles to gently bend backwards as his toes darkened. Soon his stance rested  in a comfortable bovine digitigrade, supported by the strength of hefty hooves. Stretching his arms upward, Luke felt his spine pleasurable crack as his udder gently thrust forward, the action putting its size on display for the agonizingly parched boy in front of him. To accommodate the action, his legs visibly thickened once more against the strain, bovine hormones spread through the boy accentuating the now feminine curves of his body. Letting his arms fall to his sides, he again licked his face and his hoof capped hands scratched at his leg fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Murrooatt, so full” He moaned, his voice both lighter, yet deeper in tone.  His hands once more fell to the udder, cradling it ever so slightly. Matt just looked onward, having paused to wait for his friend to initiate. <br />
<br />
<i> Wait to be used </i> Came a stray thought. Even still, the milk machine trembled in excitement. His confused thoughts were relieved at the clarity of purpose Lukes&#39;s udder brought him. His thirst, his desire, all could be fulfilled by serving this needy cow. <br />
<br />
Approaching the boy, Matt&#39;s sight line was dominated by fuzzy pink flesh. The two were inches apart, breathless silence filled the room as neither quite knew what to do. Luke’s tufted tail flicked with uncertainty - their desires, these changes on the precipice of fulfilling their purpose.</p>
