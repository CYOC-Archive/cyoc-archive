<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leah came walking down the stairs with a yawn as she parades around her heavily used diaper; the prunes were far from out of her system, and she woke up many times throughout the night with a desperate need to go just to poop herself moments later. As such, she didn&#39;t get much sleep or make it to the bathroom. She looks back at her mess with vague interest, once again impressed with how much she filled it. Prunes were a bitch to her stomach, she might as well appreciate how much of a mess she can make from it.<br />
&quot;Oh good, you&#39;re up.&quot; Rita said, dressed for work as she prepared her things, &quot;Ooh, and it looks like you need a change. Uncle Tom will be here soon, and said he&#39;s planning on taking you to the pool.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s eyes lit up as Rita picked her up. The pool sounded fun! Not to mention Leah&#39;s been meaning to show off her new bathing suit. It was hard to find something that Leah felt good in (given her general size and shape), so she was over joyed when she finally found one that did. It look stylish, cute, mature, a little sexy...truly it was the perfect find. She&#39;s wanted to show it off for a while, and now was the perfect...time...to...<br />
Leah was brought back to reality as her back touched the changing table, Rita wasting no time in getting her changed. She was in diapers, and was supposed to act like a toddler via her own decree. Her bathing suit wasn&#39;t something meant to accommodate diapers.<br />
&#39;It&#39;s okay, I can make it work.&#39; Leah thought to herself, holding onto some sense of hope that her swimsuit would get use.<br />
Rita opened Leah&#39;s diaper and retched at the smell.<br />
&quot;Goodness, those prunes make a mess out of you. I have to go soon, but I can get you changed into your new swimsuit before I go.&quot;<br />
&quot;W-wait, I can-&quot;<br />
But she was interrupted by Rita putting a pacifier in her mouth.<br />
&quot;Ah ah, you&#39;re two now remember? You need to get used to people dressing you. Just sit back and relax, okay?&quot;<br />
Leah wanted to fight back, but figured Rita was not in a listening mood; any further comment would be seen as backtalk, and Rita has shown herself to be less than willing to listen to Leah anyways. She laid down with a grumble, reluctantly sucking her pacifier. She only hoped she could get Rita to grab her preferred swimsuit.<br />
---<br />
Leah felt like crying as she looked at her reflection. Not only did Rita outright ignore her pleas, she went through the collection of bathing suits Tina left behind (she bought 6, to Leah&#39;s disbelief) to randomly grab the single most infantile outfit in the bunch in her hurry. So here Leah was, wearing a bright pink one-piece with a little skirt and diaper cover. Despite saying she was in a rush, Rita still took the time to tie Leah&#39;s hair into twin buns, and put floaties on her arms. If Leah wanted to pass as a toddler, then she doesn&#39;t think she could do better than now.<br />
&quot;Well, I think that works to make you look 2.&quot; Rita said, whispering &#39;Maybe a little too well&#39; under her breath. Leah felt a sudden rush of rage at her aunt, robbing her of one of the few things she had to look forward to. She started to push at her bowels, and was rewarded with a hefty load of poop entering her diaper. She smiled behind her pacifier, surprised and a little impressed at how much came out. It sure would suck if Rita had to change her again despite being in a hurry, wouldn&#39;t it?<br />
Rita frowned at the obvious bowel movement, filling Leah with vengeful satisfaction.<br />
&quot;Oh Leah, right now? Shoot, I don&#39;t have time to change you. Sorry, but Tom will have to.&quot; Leah&#39;s mood immediately dropped to cold regret. A stranger was going to change her? Rita changing her was already harrowing, she really didn&#39;t want some old man wiping her crotch! She didn&#39;t have a choice as Rita picked her up and took her to the living room; if Leah had a low opinion of Rita before, it was only getting lower. While Leah was thinking of how to get back at her step aunt, the doorbell rang and Rita went to answer.<br />
In walks who she assumes to be Uncle Tom, a hefty man with a natural look of kindness on his face.<br />
&quot;Hiya, Rita.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, Tom. Thank you so much for taking this so short notice. Here&#39;s little Hailey.&quot; Rita gestured to Leah, who gave a pouty &#39;humph&#39; in greeting.<br />
&quot;Well hello there, little lady! You ready to go have some fun at the pool?&quot; The man asked, sounding like he was talking to a child, but not talking down to her. It made Leah feel guilty for her greeting, and she gave a nod.<br />
&quot;Hi Uncle Tom.&quot; She said in her best toddler voice (which, of course, she barely needed to try at), giving a little wave. The man seemed nice enough, and Leah shouldn&#39;t be mean to him.<br />
&quot;Sorry if she&#39;s a little grumpy. She just had an accident, and I don&#39;t have the time to change her. Do you mind?&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face slumps into a pout again, any positive feelings out the window as she silently morns her bathing suit debut.<br />
&quot;Oh, no problem at all! Come here, let&#39;s get you cleaned up.&quot;<br />
Leah groaned as she let herself be carried to her second diaper change of the day.<br />
&quot;Alright, bye Hailey! Have fun!&quot; Rita said before she left. Leah kept her eyes trained on her even as she exited; she was definitely going to find a way to get back at her aunt.<br />
Before Leah knew it, the change was over. She sighed in relief, glad that it wasn&#39;t made anymore awkward.<br />
&quot;Alright. I got all the supplies with me. You ready to go?&quot; He asked with a fatherly smile. Leah paused, wondering if she could get changed into her actual swimsuit, but decided it wasn&#39;t worth it; if she had to be a baby for the day, she might as well embrace it. She gives an enthusiastic nod.<br />
The drive over was not as demeaning as Leah thought it would be, despite being in a booster seat. She didn&#39;t want to use the pacifier attached to her outfit anymore than necessary, and Tom didn&#39;t seem to mind. All in all, he respected Leah and her space much more than Rita had. When they finally arrived at the pool, Leah excitedly unbuckled herself and exited the car. She got a few feet before she was picked up by Tom, and cradled in his arm.<br />
&quot;Woah now, aren&#39;t you a smart little cookie. Getting out of your car seat all by yourself.&quot; Tom chuckled, making Leah feel just a tad impatient. Yeah, she had to play the toddler, but did everyone have to be so controlling? The floaties she had on made her realize she probably wouldn&#39;t get to do much outside of splashing around a little, but even that she couldn&#39;t do on her own. No freedom, no fun, and NO! FREAKING BATHING SUIT! Leah gritted her teeth in anger. What was the point of going to the pool at all? Just to feel even more infantile than she did before?<br />
&quot;Oops, are you upset?&quot; Tom asked, to which Leah responded with another pout. She might have to be a toddler, but she didn&#39;t have to be happy about it.<br />
&quot;Aww, Rita not treating you like a big girl? I can see how much she frustrates you.&quot; He chuckled, making Leah freeze. Shit, was she that obvious?<br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s just your aunt, right? Rita&#39;s always had a weird relationship with kids, I know how frustrating she can be.&quot; He gave her a genuine smile, and seemed to once again not talk down to her. Leah sulked as she felt guilty again. <br />
&quot;Sowwy.&quot; Leah said.<br />
&quot;Ah, no need to feel bad. I&#39;d be a little grumpy too if I was hoisted around like that. Here, how about you choose what to do, and if you don&#39;t know, I have a few fun things in mind.&quot;<br />
Leah hummed in thought. She had to admit, Rita was right; already, Leah felt incredibly comfortable with the man---he just exuded fatherly charm. Maybe this won&#39;t be so bad? Leah finally decides...</p>
