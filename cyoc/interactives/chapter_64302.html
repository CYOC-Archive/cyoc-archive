<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting on your bed, all too aware that you are wearing a little girl&#39;s costume, holding a pair of blue tights with a glittery fashion that you suppose might be stars splashed across the garment, you look at the wings, wondering what you should tell your mother and how you wound up wearing a dress that clearly should be to small on you.<br />
<br />
A glance in the direction of the door to your room as you hear somebody approaching, figuring it was Megan, you look back at your mother and gasp. Sliding off the bed, you walk across the room and whisper, &quot;Mom?&quot; as you reach out and touch her, finding it strange and terrifying that for some reason, your mother has been frozen in place. And then, from behind you, you hear the voice of your sister tell you, &quot;She really isn&#39;t your mom. It is just an illusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spinning about in place, you look at the young girl standing in your doorway, note that she was wearing a dress similar to yours, only green, and pointing at your mother, you sputter out, &quot;Yes, she is to my mother. What is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of answering you, the girl glided into your room and heading for your bed, she crawled up onto it and straightening her dress, which you think the wings on the back look more realistic then they should be, she looks in your direction and once again tells you, &quot;This is all an illusion,&quot; stops and glanced down and looking back up, she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I am going about this all the wrong way. Perhaps I should begin at the beginning. Perhaps that would help.&quot;<br />
<br />
A glance back at your mom and then back at the girl you thought of as your sister, but where now thinking otherwise, and after a moment, you nod and tell her, &quot;Perhaps you should.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, Megan ran a hand over her dress and then asked, &quot;How well do you know an older woman calling herself Megan? Do you actually have memories of her coming to work in the same place you worked? Do you remember at all pushing her away when she asked you out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vaguely,&quot; you answered back, after a bit of thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you should understand is that I am that woman and at the same time, I am the girl before you. I am a creature called a fairy. A princess to be more specific. I have one older brother, who will be king one day. But that is neither here nor there. What should be known is that you must make a choice, for time is running out and if you don&#39;t, you are doomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, you looked about the room, at your mom, still reeling and coming to terms that all around you was an illusion and finally turning your attention back to Megan, you asked, &quot;What choice? Why do you say I am doomed?&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile disappeared from her face and for a couple moments she was silent before saying, &quot;My brother and I came to a pact, some time ago. We both wanted a new sibling, but knew that mummy and daddy would not be creating anyone any time soon. So we took it upon ourselves to approach the situation the olde fashioned way. We would approach a mortal and give them a choice. I approached you at your place of work as Megan, but I do not know where my brother approached you. Sometime after I had approached you, and you had attempted to revoke me, you found the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sliding off the bed, she sat down on the floor, curling her legs up close to her body, hiding them under her dress and making a motion for you to sit, which you took after a moment&#39;s deliberation, she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;The park is a gateway, a nexus, if you will. It has many exits, but only two entrances, your world and the world of Fey. Inside, you found the bathroom, one of the odder exits, but an exit none the least. Going into the bathroom, you were transformed into a childe, the first step of the transformation. Afterward, you should have had a choice, a set of boy&#39;s clothes or a set of girl&#39;s clothes. In the end, you choose the girl&#39;s garments and everything should have been fine, especially when I found you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, it wasn&#39;t. Somehow you slipped away and found your way back into the bathroom and then back into the park. I had to intervene and offer you this illusion, for I knew what would happen if you kept denying what had happened and was happening to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling hesitant, you feel a sense of dread crawl over you as you asked, &quot;What is happening to me? And what is going to happen if I keep denying it? You said I might be doomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down, an appearance of shame crossing her youthful face, Megan did not reply at first, but when she looked up at you, she explained, &quot;Slowly, you are turning back into a girl. If you except, you will eventually become a fairy princess, like me, my younger sister to be more precise. But, if you choose to keep denying what is happening, you shall become like at the others that have refused out gifts. You shall become naught but a mindless beast. And in your case, for I can see it, just as clearly as I see your aura, the beast you shall become is a bitch poodle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So one way or another I become female,&quot; you scream out, jumping up and starting to pace back and forth. After a bit, you stop and look at Megan, irate about all that was happening, and unsure what you should say, you began to rant, &quot;My choices are either be your sister, a fairy princess, or become a mindless beast. In this case, a poodle. But that isn&#39;t all. Either way, I become female. Well, what if I don&#39;t want to be a girl. What if I want to be my olde self. Go to the same job I was going to before all this started. What if I just want to be me again. Plain, simple me. Not some person stuck in an illusion where it turns out that fairies are real and I have been approached by not one, but two. And they want be to be there sibling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping, you glare at Megan, but found that she was looking down at her dress and after a moment, you felt the anger you&#39;d been feeling leave and sinking to the floor, shifting about so that you are somewhat comfortable and glancing at Megan, you asked, &quot;How long do I have before I must make a decision?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not looking up at you, Megan does not say anything at first, but after a moment, still with her eyes downcast, she told you, &quot;You have forty eight hours. Then, it will be too late and you shall start to become a mindless beast. I am sorry, but you did make the choice, whether you realise it or not. You choose to go into the park. Into the bathroom. You choose...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jumping up, cutting her off in midsentence as you announced, &quot;I need time to think,&quot; realising that you were still holding the tights and wings, you started across my room, stopped, noticed that there was a pair of ballet-like slippers poking out from under your bed, a memory coming to you that said you&#39;d purchased this costume some hours ago and that the slippers went with it, you shake your head, started to exit, change your mind, head back in, grabbed the slippers from out from under, thought about leaving it all sitting on your bed, but instead marched out of your room, leaving illusion mom still frozen and Megan sitting on the floor.</p>
