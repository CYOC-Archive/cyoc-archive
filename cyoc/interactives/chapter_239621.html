<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh thought long and hard about what he would write. The power to shape reality at his fingertips? It had to be too good to be true. But just in case, he wanted to make absolute sure he got everything he wanted the first go around. He had a lot of fun and kinky ideas he wanted to try, though, but he wasn’t exactly sure how this whole book thing worked, so he wanted to start with a good one. Josh was into a lot of weird stuff, mainly revolving around women. They were hot and sexy and beautiful and deep down, he wished everyone was one, himself included. He also had a fetish for certain things like smell, taste, and, weirdly, women’s armpits. He took his pen and began crafting his masterpiece…<br />
<br />
“Men and women will look mostly identical, both appearing female. Both will be entirely blank in both their crotches and between their ass cheeks. Women will have a pair of fully functional pussies in their armpits, and men will have a cock and balls under each arm, with an anus below each, which of course will also be fully functional. Women’s noses will be replaced by an anus, which functions the same as a normal anus, and new nostrils will appear on either side of both their urethras, which function just like normal nostrils. The tips of men’s dicks will now be covered in taste buds. Men will grow more masculine pubes under their arms, while women will generally have thinner and more feminine armpit pubes. Of course women will also have ass hairs on their faces around their anuses to deal with too. Other than pubes though, both sexes now have more feminine body hair, with men growing slightly more of it due to having lots of testosterone. But overall, testosterone is far weaker than estrogen in this universe. Oh and just for good measure, the average chest size increases significantly and breast development starts earlier on in puberty. This applies to both sexes, but is more pronounced for women. Men are ever so slightly more muscular and have slightly deeper voices, though this is barely noticeable. Oh, and lastly, women have two extra pairs of vocal cords that run along the sides of their birth canal, so whenever they try to talk, it’s like a vibrator turning on inside of them. They aren’t insanely powerful, so they can eventually get used to it, but it’s enough that every so often while talking a woman will bring herself to orgasm. Plus it causes their pussy to produce a quiet moaning sound whenever they talk. Oh, and just to be fair, when a man gets too aroused, his tongue hardens and partly transforms into a third cock. Their tongues are erogenous so this happens somewhat frequently. The internals of both men and women will rearrange to accommodate their new anatomy, being as close to anatomically plausible as possible, without causing excessively life-threatening complications which might arise from their rearranged anatomy.”<br />
<br />
Josh was fairly satisfied with his work. These changes should make sex pretty interesting. And also just make life annoying for both sexes fairly equally, but in a fun way. Lastly, he quickly made it so his sister would also be aware of the changes, just so he could see her reaction.<br />
<br />
He put the pen down, expecting some kind of transformation but instead, he suddenly found himself in front of the bathroom mirror, with his cheek pressed against one raised arm and a pink razor in hand, halfway through shaving the pubes under one arm, just above his flaccid armpit cock. He turned to look in the mirror, shocked by the beauty in the mirror; her long, dark hair, cute face and glasses contrasted sharply by the hairy genitals under her arms. He found that trying to bring his arms down by his sides was slightly uncomfortable, squishing his doubled genitals in a similar way to crossing his legs with them between them. Speaking of his legs, he ran a hand along his smooth, barren crotch, tracing a line all the way from his belly to his tailbone, it was totally blank. Raising his arm again, he lifted his scrotum to reveal his misplaced anus beneath it. Seeing his genitals from this angle was strange, and it was then he realized the strange taste in his mouth was coming from his foreskins, which were partly covering the bumpy surfaces of his cock heads. He pinched one of them, feeling the rough texture while also tasting the saltiness of his sweaty fingers through his penis. Having multiple centers of taste was certainly a unique experience, though having to taste dick constantly was going to take some getting used to. His fucked up transformation was already causing his cocks and tongue to begin to harden, with his tongue becoming cylindrical and jutting out from his lips. “Ahh thuph”, he lisped. <br />
<br />
Just then, his sister, Matilda, burst into the room, and finally got the chance to survey the other side of his handiwork. Plastered right there on her face was her pretty pink puckered anus, ringed by a bit of stubble since she’d neglected shaving it for a while. Her subtle B-cups had blossomed into something between an E and an F by the looks of them. Tears were streaming down her face, and in a nasally voice, she cried out, “Joosh, wuuuhhh… the fuuuaaooouukk…. *gasp* did yooooohhh… UUUHHHHH… OOOOOAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!” She was cut off as she cried out in pleasure, unaccustomed to the runaway sensations caused by her twin vibrating vaginal canals. Every moan only increased her pleasure as she quickly brought herself to an orgasm. A pair of wet spots formed the sides of her shirt as vaginal juices gushed from her armpits. “Oh fujhh, ahh, ahh, what was… uhh… that.” She reduced her volume to a mere whisper, trying to find a way to talk without causing vibrations in her misplaced nethers. “Josh what the actual fuck did you do to me!!!!” She practically shouted in the loudest whisper she could muster. She gasped at the sight of him, his breasts covered in a towel wrapped around his waist, his erect cocks under his arms, and the semi-erect cock/tongue thing sticking out of his mouth. “Mothnin thith!” He said in a barely comprehensible lisp. She turned to look in the mirror, slack jawed as she stared at the puckered donut that had taken up residence where her nose should’ve been. She slowly raised a hand to touch it, as if touching it would make it go away, only to yelp as she felt her fingers touch her butthole. On her face. Her butthole was on her face. The yelp then evolved into a cry of pleasure as she once again stimulated herself with her own voice. “Whaaat iiiissss thiiiiissss?!!?!!!!”</p>

Suddenly, something occurred to Josh. Where was the book?</h3>
