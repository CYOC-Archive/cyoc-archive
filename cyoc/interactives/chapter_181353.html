<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the club was easy for two hot babes.<br />
<br />
Georgia was dressed tightly in her sleeveless black dress, no window to her cleavage and a low hem to her dress that left pretty much everything to the imagination. Lana was dressed in a deep red dress with neckline so low you could nearly see her nipples and an open Diamond that showed off her navel. She wore heels while Georgia wore boots that rose up to her knees.<br />
<br />
Georgia elbowed Lana and she flashed the bouncer, he was grinning like an idiot and his eyes were trained right on the demon girl’s breasts hungrily, like all he wanted to do was motorboat them. Too bad he had a job to do otherwise Lana probably would have let him do it.<br />
<br />
The club was loud, colourful, and crowded, just the kind of place for two demon babes to find some nice prey. Georgia licked her lips and sauntered straight towards a bunch of hot college guys while Lana approached the bar and bent forward, laying her big breasts on the counter so they squished and changed shape, distracting the bartender. Oh he definitely wanted to titty-fuck her.<br />
<br />
“You’re cute,” Lana giggled, running a finger under his chin. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed on the floor of the bar. “But I’m hungry for a little chaos tonight, maybe I’ll ride that dick some other time cutie.”<br />
<br />
She then vaulted behind the bar and when she stood up she was wearing a pair of black pants and a button down shirt with her cleavage visible. She was dressed just like the bartender had been seconds ago and she smirked to herself as someone flagged her over for a drink.<br />
<br />
Georgia meanwhile sauntered up to a couple guys who looked exactly like what she was after, a bunch of macho fraternity men with tight shirts on and six drinks already in their systems each. All she had to do was walk past them and one of them did the typical frat guy thing of reaching out and running a hand across the smooth fabric of her dress. She stopped and looked back at the guy who’d touched her rear, giving him a flirty look and watching as his pants tented. He grinned from ear to ear before handing his cup to his buddy and putting an arm around her shoulder, guiding her to the dance floor.<br />
<br />
The drink Lana had just mixed fizzled and the guy she handed it to didn’t seem to care or notice, too busy staring at her chest. She giggled flirtily as he took a drink before narrowing her eyes. That cute looking turning malicious the guy swallowed and blinked, seeming to lose balance and start to wobble. His face then took on a look of contentment, a lazy look like everything was calm and normal. He then stumbled away and up to a random guy, planting his lips right on that guy’s.<br />
<br />
“You’re gonna feel that in your ass come morning,” Lana giggled, wishing she could see the guy’s reaction when he woke up and his sexuality returned to straight.<br />
<br />
“Can I get a Sex on the beach?” A blonde woman asked while putting some cash down on the counter.<br />
<br />
“You can have a sex with your best friend,” Lana whispered to herself as she mixed the drink, dipping her fingernail in it and making the entire drink turn blue. She then slid it to her customer and the girl drank it heartily before blinking. Lana leaned on the counter and smiled at the girl with an evil glint in her eyes. “What’s his name?”<br />
<br />
“Harrison,” the woman grunted, clutching her forehead like she had a migraine. “We’ve been friends since high school, we... we play D & D together still. I don’t like him like him though.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t knock it till you try it,” Lana grinned. “Isn’t he kinda cute?”<br />
<br />
“... yeah,” the woman blushed.<br />
<br />
“He’s got a stable job, you know everything about him...” she trailed.<br />
<br />
“He writes books as a hobby,” the woman blushed. “Do you think he’d write them for me if we were together?”<br />
<br />
“Totally,” Lana grinned. “This club is so loud and boring, wouldn’t you rather be riding his dick tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Ride his dick?” The woman blushed.<br />
<br />
“You can decide if you like it in the morning, but for now that’s all you want isn’t it?” Lana smiled. “To play a little dungeons and dick with Harrison.”<br />
<br />
“Screw this place!” The woman exclaimed, putting her drink down. “I’m gonna go fuck my beat friend.”<br />
<br />
“You go girl,” Lana smiled, watching as that girl wandered away. Maybe it would work out, or maybe their friendship would be destroyed. Either way it was fun.<br />
<br />
“Hello! Bartender!” A woman screeched from the other end of the bar. “Can I get some fucking service?!”<br />
<br />
“Someone wants to be extra fertile tonight,” Lana grinned. Her smile only matched by Georgia’s.<br />
<br />
The dance floor was long behind them, they’d moved to the men’s washroom and her dress was hiked up and her panties pulled down while that hot ass boytoy thrust into her with his meaty frat dick.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, you’re doing so good,” Georgia sighed, licking her lips. “Your form needs work though, I’m barely breaking a sweat.”<br />
<br />
“You’re criticizing me bitch?” Her fuckboy asked, looking rather annoyed. He increased in tempo and pressed her against the wall harder. “Just shut up and enjoy my dick, you won’t find a better one in this club.”<br />
<br />
“Your type is always so proud of your junk, you have a lot of manliness, and that’s exactly what I’m after,” Georgia yawned. “Let’s see how interesting you are without your prized dick?”<br />
<br />
“Let’s see how you like my seed,” her latest dick grunted before unloading in her. He pumped white fluid in her body and her vagina drank it up happily, and with it took a little bit more. He dumped her on the ground and put his dick back in his pants, doing his belt up again. “Don’t call me if you get pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t worry about me, thanks for your manly essence,” Georgia grinned while rising to her feet, dress pulled down and panties back up.<br />
<br />
“Essence?” The guy asked before keeling over. Georgia just fixed her hair in the mirror and walked out, nearly treading on the guy’s hand as he reached for her.<br />
<br />
He panted sweatily, feeling ill and weak and watched in horror as his prized muscles began to wither away leaving his limbs scrawny and girly.<br />
<br />
“No!” He yowled as his hands shrunk, his nails grew, and his blonde hair exploded from his scalp, hiding his vision. His bones cracked painfully as he got smaller, thinner, and weaker. His waist popped in with a crack, his hips popped out with a scream of pain, and his body hair fell into the bathroom floor pathetically. His clothing merged together, his jawline shriveled, and his nose broke three times as it shrunk. Pain coursed through his chest as mounds of flesh erupted from it, every breath painful. His shoes were pointed at the end, digging a long heel into his thigh and...<br />
<br />
“No!” He yelped, stumbling to his feet and feeing his smooth crotch. “No! No! Noooooo!”<br />
<br />
It was gone, his fingers instead found a girly vagina. He looked up, his blonde hair was long and washed, beautiful and feminine, he had makeup on, his ears were pieced. There was a woman in the mirror and she was doing everything he did. A scream escape his, or rather her lips and was drowned out by the thumping music of the club.</p>
