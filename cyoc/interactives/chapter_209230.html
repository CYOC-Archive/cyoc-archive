<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Honestly, Laura was pissed that the remote wasn&#39;t working as intended. She really wanted to throw it in the trash bin if it hadn&#39;t been for another woman outside. A nerdy college girl, April, just arrived at the bus station on the other side of the road, minding her own business. She wasn&#39;t anything special, quite the opposite. She was 5&#39;2&quot; tall, too skinny in Laura&#39;s eyes and didn&#39;t look good as well. She was your typical nerdy girl and apparently bullied by other girls in college.<br />
<br />
Camille, the bully, was making April&#39;s life a living hell. Anytime she got the chance to she embarassed her in college. Not only was she beautiful, but had a killer body as well. Her body was fit and taut at 5&#39;10&quot;, more than enough in combination with her beauty to rank her high in the popularity scale. Not only that, she wasn&#39;t dumb either. Maybe not as smart as April, but certainly above average.<br />
<br />
She arrived at the bus station about half a minute later than her, all alone, but certainly not peaceful just because of it. It didn&#39;t matter to her if she could embarass her in front of others, she liked it for herself as well. Laura couldn&#39;t understand what she said to her, but her body language and actions were more than telling. She laughed at her while pushing her full force. April fell over, but didn&#39;t want to stand up against her bully. She simply picked up her folder and let it slide.<br />
<br />
Laura knew she had to help her, even if she was more than sure that the remote wasn&#39;t working one bit. But still, she had to try.<br />
<br />
She aimed for the girl in need, April, but accidentally targeted Camille instead. In an attempt to help her she not only selected the wrong person, but also failed to notice it afterwards. So with all the good intention in mind, she was about to gift the changes to the bully and not the nerd.<br />
<br />
For starters, she pressed &quot;Enhance&quot; a few times, hoping to even things out for her. Laura look out the window, but apparently it didn&#39;t do much yet. Camille still towered above her at 6&#39;6&quot; and looked like she could go to olympia with a body like hers any minute now. Hoping to even things out faster, she pressed it many more times.<br />
<br />
Laura knew that the remote was trash, or very slow at least. But the difference between the girls were still huge! Camille was proud as ever with her 7&#39;10&quot; tall body, fully covered in mighty muscles with an ass to make men drool and boobs the size of basketballs. And Laura noticed that she looked like she was about to beat the crap out of the nerd again! With incredible speed, she spammed the &quot;Enhance&quot; button, only wanting the best outcome for April.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Best&quot; outcome in this case was the biggest and strongest bully ever standing just inches beside the cowering nerd. At 9&#39;10&quot;, Camille the musclebound amazon dwarfed every student in existence... well, except Jessica. But where Jessica was nice and kind-hearted, Camille was mischievous and bratty. Somebody would have faced her with consequences if it wasn&#39;t for her impossibly hard, medicineball-sized biceps and shredded 8-pack. She could knock out anyone without ever trying and could take the hardest hits without feeling them one bit. Camille now loomed over April, looking like she was going to enjoy was would be happening soon. Laura of course couldn&#39;t let that happen and spammed the button for far longer and faster than the world, and especially April, would have needed it.<br />
<br />
Now Laura was convinced that the remote wasn&#39;t working at all. How else could April still be this small at 5&#39;2&quot; compared to the huge 14 feet tall mini-giantess beside her. She was the only person that Laura knew of that was bigger than Jessica. And even she left her in her shadow. Her fridge-sized mountains of pure, impossibly dense mass resting atop her arms proved to anyone that she shouldn&#39;t be messed with. Her 12-pack of ripped abs fought for room on her very narrow waist, fully surrounded by equally impressive obliques. Her legs alone were taller than pretty much everyone and far, far wider as well. Her ass was big and hard enough to &quot;accidentally&quot; obliterate walls like a wrecking ball would do. Her boobs were bigger than small cars each and firm as can be, and then some. Each step she took shook the ground severely. One time a student had witnesses her casually lifting up a bus like it was nothing. And that was a few weeks ago. Until now she probably only got stronger and stronger, a thought which terrified everyone she disliked.<br />
<br />
Laura gave up. It was worse enough that she couldn&#39;t help the nerd, but fiddling around with a useless remote while the biggest person ever was picking on her as she watched them was worse enough.</p>
