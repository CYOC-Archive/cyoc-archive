<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Jack is not interested in changing into a girl, and he doesn&#39;t plan on getting older again for a while</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack woke up on Monday without noticing any changes to his body, though he was surprised at the smaller paunch on his body.  However, nothing else has changed yet, so he guessed that he got only a few months younger during the night.  Keeping in mind that the physical changes would take 3 days, Jack carried on with his morning routine, albeit with clothes that were a little loose on him, and eventually headed off to school.  Following an uneventful morning, Jack noticed an odd change inside his locker before lunch; the books inside were for sophomores and not juniors like he was supposed to be.  He was forced to pretend that nothing was out of the ordinary, but he could not ignore it when the afternoon classes began.  It was when he found himself sitting in a sophomore class that everything was changing, but he could not marvel at the changes until school had finished for the day.  To add to the shock, his best friends had changed with him, being moved to sophomore as well while everyone else was unaffected.<br />
<br />
Being a sophomore again meant that Jack was no longer able to drive, hence he had to walk back home with some of his friends.  Jack could only pretend that everything was okay, and none of his friends commented on their sudden move down a grade.  When Jack finally returned home, the opportunity was finally given to him.  Sure he was still on the chubby side, but his paunch was even smaller than before, and the sideburns that he had been growing lately had disappeared.  Jack was not surprised to see that the Chronivac had already changed him as he was already slimming down and the fact that he was 15 again.  He stepped away from the Chronivac to do some homework that he thought he already did last year.  Nothing eventful had occurred for the rest of the day aside from losing a couple more inches before Jack headed to bed.  He was, however, unaware that he ended up 14 years old during the evening.<br />
<br />
Jack woke up on Tuesday to one startling change that he noticed immediately.  He was still in the same bed as the previous night, and his room still looked the same, but his legs aren&#39;t extending past the end of the bed like they normally do.  If anything, they was just a bit of space between the end of the bed and his feet.  Surprised, he jumped from his bed, only to find his room slightly larger, but didn&#39;t bother to check the Chronivac until it was time to get ready for school.  It started when he looked at the bathroom mirror.  His freckles started to reappear, his hair started growing out into the bobcut that he had throughout childhood, and his genitals barely had any hair.  He checked his stats on the Chronivac, only to have a higher pitched scream come from his mouth.  Jack was 13 years old again, and he was still a bit overweight standing at 145 pounds and 5&#39; 3&quot;.  It was at that sight that his fantasy was coming true, and he realized that he would make his return to middle school.<br />
<br />
Though it has been a few years since he actually was in middle school, Jack was surprised that he remembered where his bus stop was.  Unlike his high school, Jack&#39;s middle school was a little further away from his house, which forced him and his friends to take the bus.  Both during the ride to school and the entire morning went by mostly uneventfully, but Jack once again noticed that his friends were also younger and they once again didn&#39;t notice.  He was also surprised at how easy the 8th grade classes were considering that he didn&#39;t regress mentally yet.  However, Jack changed once again during an afternoon class as he suddenly found himself in a different room and a different class.  The students surrounding him were different and his voice was even higher, which was when Jack realized that he was a 7th grader again.  He tried not to get distracted by the fact that he was already 12 again, and by the fact that some baby teeth started reappearing throughout the afternoon.  Once Jack returned home from middle school, it was the usual after-school routine for him even though he breezed through his 7th grade homework.  He did, however, had to go to bed earlier at the request of his parents, who didn&#39;t look that much different from before.<br />
<br />
Waking up on Wednesday, Jack was both surprised and ecstatic that he was even smaller than when he went to bed.  His haircut was now officially the bob-cut that dominated his elementary school photos, his front teeth were more prominent, and his freckles fully returned to his face.  His jaw dropped to the ground and could barely contain his excitement as he learned that he was really a child again.  To top it off, Jack&#39;s paunch was gone and his weight was average for a boy his age.  Jack was 10 years old again, and he was at a healthy weight, standing at 82 pounds and 4&#39; 7&quot;.  He also realized that he would return to elementary school, which was when he was much better at football.<br />
<br />
Jack had expected to end up even younger during the school day, but he remained in his 5th grade class, which meant his regression is slowing down.  While he did have fun during recess, it was his football practice after school that made his day.  Right away, his skills were the same as when he was first this age, but being more athletic than he was originally meant that he had no trouble at all.  He was back in his football glory days, and his wish came true.  Exhausted after practice, Jack rushed on his 5th grade homework before heading off to bed, fully aware that he wasn&#39;t finished regressing yet.<br />
<br />
Jack had finished regressing just as he woke up on Thursday.  Jack&#39;s jaw once again dropped has he checked the Chronivac stats once again.  As a result of the physical changes, Jack is now 8 years old, and is at a healthy weight of 58 pounds and 4&#39; 2&quot;.  He still has blue eyes and blonde hair, albeit with the bob-cut that he started to grow familiar with, and his face was full of freckles.  A heavy grin appeared on the boy&#39;s face, happy that his fantasy has come true, and that he would start mentally regressing.</p>
