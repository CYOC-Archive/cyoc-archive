<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><I>A little known entity has bounced here and there, all over our world, ever since mankind became capable of reason.  A shapeshifter, able to make itself invisible for all but the soul-possessing creatures it bonds to.  It&#39;s true form is unknown, but those that it has bonded to instinctively know its true name, even if they never know the connection between it, and their bizarre fates.</I><br />

&quot;Have you seen how savagely those beasts attack?&quot;  One hunter said to another of his tribe, pointing to the wolves in the distance, &quot;and how loyal they are to each other?  There&#39;s no way they could ever tame them.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nearby raccoon&#39;s tail flicked suddenly, and the hunter&#39;s world seemed to go white for a moment. when he opened his eyes, he saw his children, happily playing with one of those beasts, several of it&#39;s pups nearby in one of their huts.  The other members of his tribe turned to him in confusion.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?  We&#39;ve been breeding them to be docile for generations.&quot;<br />
__________________<br />
<br />
<I>The entity possessed an unusual power, capable of triggering whenever the creature it has bound itself to made a statement the speaker believed to be true.  Once it started, the very foundations of reality would shift, all toward a single purpose:<br />
<br />
Making that statement false.</I><br />
__________________<br />
<br />
The witch sneered inside her cottage, all her most lethal and painful spells at the ready.   With her ability to &quot;borrow&quot; the senses of animals in the nearby forest, she could smell the townsfolk drawing closer to her home, torches and pitchforks raised.  <br />
<br />
Like those would harm her.  The contract she had paid with her soul could not be broken so easily.<br />
<br />
She listened carefully, hearing the people&#39;s words through the ears of owls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a few meters from here is the clearing!&quot;  The leader of the men shouted.  &quot;And in that cottage, the witch that has cursed our village with famine!  Only by striking her down can we remove this blight!  Who&#39;s with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other villagers cheered, and the witch laughed.  Even an army couldn&#39;t stop her power.  But her laughter came to a stop when she heard a cat near the mob of humans mew softly, and the world suddenly seemed to go white.  She felt a strange warmth in her heart, as her old wrinkled, warty skin began to tighten up, her crooked back becoming straight.  All but one of her spellbooks vanished, and all of her potions, wands, and trinkets faded into nothingness.  Even her memories of magic, beyond a vague knowledge of its existence, disappeared from her mind.<br />
<br />
When the villagers broke through the door, the young lady gasped and tried to hide.  The leader of the crowd looked at her in confusion, wondering if it was this could really the horrific witch that he knew lay within these walls.  &quot;Madam, we have come to try you for witchcraft.  Do not be afraid, there are many reliable tests to prove if you are, or are not a witch, and none of them will harm you if you are not.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he said those words, the words in the town&#39;s book on finding witches wriggled around the page, forming the description of a new test; one that required the suspect be drowned to prove it.<br />
__________________<br />
<br />
<I>All evidence in the world would lead one to think the statement had always been false, and the memories of all involved would be altered to corroborate the new facts.  All memories, that is, except for those of the original speaker, who, in this new reality, would still have uttered the now-false statement.<br />
<br />
This power had the potential to be devastating, as the bonded human could reshape life itself to their whim if it could be controlled.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for those bonded to the entity, that &quot;if&quot; was unlikely to be true in any of their lifetimes.</I><br />

&quot;They thought they could pull the wool over our eyes&quot; a young man whispered to himself as he sneaked backstage.  He could see the &quot;mayor&quot; addressing the people of the city from behind the podium.  Security at this speech was nearly non-existent.   Now was his chance!  He&#39;d unmask that imposter here and now!<br />
<br />
He leapt through the curtains and shoved the &quot;mayor&quot; to the ground, pinning him down.  The audience gasped, unsure of what to do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Citizens of Spartanburg!&quot;  The young man shouted.  &quot;It saddens me to say this, but our beloved mayor is no more!  He has been replaced, by this reptilian fake!&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man reached for the the old man&#39;s hair, pulling at the rubber mask on the politician&#39;s head, revealing the green scales underneath bit by bit.  Before it could be completely removed, however, a little rat that was under the stage tapped its paw twice.  The world went white for a moment, and the &quot;mask&quot; the mayor had been wearing slipped back on without escaping the young man&#39;s grip, and sealed itself into the old man&#39;s skin, the scales underneath being replaced by genuine human flesh and blood.<br />
<br />
The young man gasped, tugging at the old man&#39;s hair again and again.  &quot;What are you doing you psycho?&quot;  The old man yelled, as two police officers ran up onstage to take the young man away.<br />

<br />
<I>For not only did the bonded human need to sincerely believe what they were saying for the power to change it, but the entity itself would need to decide that that particular statement was the one it would turn false.  For this entity had a will of its own.  Few have known what it&#39;s goals are, or if it even is human enough in its thought processes to have goals.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it would bond to humans for their whole lifetime, some it would bond to for just a week, and others still would find their time bonded to be some time in between.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, the changes to reality could be drastic, immediate, and impossible to miss were it not for the altered memories.  Other times, it would look like the changes didn&#39;t happen retroactively, instead giving the impression that the change had simply been in the works for a while.</I><br />

&quot;A guy like him would never love a girl like me,&quot; the teenager groaned.  <br />
<br />
Climbing up the side of the building the teenager was leaning back against, a gecko stopped moving, then licked its eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t say that about yourself,&quot; a male voice said.  The girl looked up, to see her crush smiling down at her.<br />

The new CEO sat back in the chair in his new office.  It had taken a lot of work, but he finally came to be in charge of the company he&#39;d loyally served for years.  &quot;And all honestly, too boot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just outside the door, the CEO&#39;s secretary winked.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the CEO&#39;s cell phone rang.  He picked it up.  &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you did to get where you are...&quot;  The scrambled voice on the other end said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb, I have proof.&quot;  A text message appeared on the CEO&#39;s phone, with a photo a bribery letter, written in his handwriting.  &quot;If you want to keep this quiet, you&#39;ll need to do exactly as I say, understood?&quot;<br />
