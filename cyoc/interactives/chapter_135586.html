<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before I get a chance to decide, I suddenly hear someone knocking on the door. I feel my heartbeat rise, I’m still a girl. Suddenly, I remember that I had done reality shift, so, to everyone else, this is how I’ve always been. I sigh as the person knocks again, and get up to my feet. I look through the peephole first, it was Brian. He’s one of my ‘friends’ so to say, although he’s always busy since he’s on the football team and is super popular. It was quite a surprise to see him showing up at my house.<br />
<br />
I open the door, blushing slightly, for some reason I couldn’t help but notice that he’s hot. I’m slightly scared of the thought at first, but I decide to go with the flow, I can always change back like this never happened. He clears his throat slightly before speaking up,<br />
“Hey, so I was thinking… well… I was wondering if we could spend some time together, I know I’ve not been a great friend with me being busy all the time and all.”<br />
This could be fun. “Oh, yeah, that sounds great. Do you want to come in?”<br />
Brian nods his head, “Sure, thanks.”<br />
<br />
I open the door wider, and let him, closing it once he’s in. I can’t help but look at his toned muscles, they were clearly visible since he was wearing a tank top.<br />
“So, did you have anything in mind of what to do?” I ask with my new soothing feminine voice. It came out much more sexily than I intended it to.<br />
“Well…” He starts, definitely lured in by my voice, I could see him glancing at my breasts and I notice a bulge beginning to form in his pants, “... we could stay in your house, since its so hot out, get to know each other a little better.”<br />
Suddenly an idea forms in my head, “Sure, let me just go grab something from my room, I’ll be right out. Make yourself comfortable.”<br />
<br />
I quickly rush off to my room, and go back to the Chronivac’s first window, and start typing in ‘Brian.’ His name appears, and I click on it. All of his stats appear, I’m surprised to see his dick was only a piddly 4 inches, considering how much he brags about it being huge. Out of my newfound feminine lust, I jack it up to a whopping 6 feet long, with a girth of a foot. Seeing the bulge grow and the burst through the the 3d model’s pants makes my crotch start to feel warm and moist, and I start to reach a hand into my panties, circling my finger around my lips. I let out a very subtle moan as I look at it.<br />
<br />
“You almost done?” He calls out from the living room.<br />
“Almost, just a sec!” I yell out, and pull my hand out of my panties, quickly clicking save. I go ahead and set the ‘time to transform’ to 5 minutes, and I notice a ‘delay’ feature I hadn’t noticed before, which I go ahead and set to 1 minute. I set the duration to ‘until program is shut off.’ I click save, and see the progress bar appear, which now has a timer counting down to when the transformation will start. <br />
<br />
I close my laptop and quickly get up, walking out to Brian. I flop down on the couch next to him,<br />
“Sorry about that, now, you wanted to get to know each other better?”<br />
“Yeah. How have things been going? Anything interesting you’re doing this summer?” He asks. It should be starting any time now!<br />
“Yeah, I recently got a package, so I’m playing around with that.”<br />
“Oh, cool. I’ve been…” he pauses, shifting his position. He starts opening his to continue, but he has to reposition himself again. “Sorry, I’m just feeling this strange tugging… it must be my pants…” He half mumbles to me. It was happening! I feel myself giddy with excitement as I watch his bulge enlarge. He awkwardly smiles, feeling much more uncomfortable from my staring, which only turns me on more.<br />
“Sorry… I don’t know what’s happening.” He says as his pants begin to strain under the pressure under the size of his cock. <br />
<br />
He struggles to try and get his pants off, but to no avail as they explode off, and his dick springs out, erect. I feel the heat from my pussy spreading throughout my whole body, and it was soaking wet. My hand shoots back into my panties, and I immediately start rubbing my pulsating clit. I feel a wave of pleasure take over me, and I let out a loud moan, arching my back and closing my eyes. I try to open them, to see Brian’s dick now large enough to touch the floor as he’s standing.<br />
“What the fuck is happening?!” He yells out, so distracted by his dick that he doesn’t notice me.<br />
<br />
I keep rubbing furiously, pinching and rubbing one of my nipples with my other hand. I moan more and louder, eventually starting to convulse in pure ecstasy as I near orgasm. I take one more glance at Brian’s dick, which was almost at its full size, and feel a huge wave of pleasure spread through my entire body, making me shudder, as I have my first female orgasm. I slow down my panting, my hand drenched in my juices. I look at Brian, who was rubbing his dick from my display. I move over, kneeling down, starting to lick his dick’s tip. He lets out a moan in surprise, and suddenly cum erupts from his dick with enough force to knock him over, which sprays it wildly all over the room, coating everything in it. I end up with a mouthful of it as well, it tasted very sweet and delicious, so I swallow it. Addicted to the taste, I begin licking the rest of hit up, I glance over as I am to notice Brian must’ve been knocked unconscious by the power of his orgasm.<br />
<br />
Eventually I lick it all up, leaving the room spotless. Brian then wakes up, “That… that was the best thing ever!!!” <br />
“There’s plenty more where that came from.” I say lustfully, ready for a second round, when I get an idea.<br />
“Hey, give me a sec, you focus on letting your cum replenish.”<br />
He nods his head, and stays there laying on the ground. I dash to my room, pulling up myself in the Chronivac. I look through some settinging, eventually finding something to make my pussy able to expand to accommodate Brian’s six footer, while still remaining tight. <br />
<br />
I accept the changes, and head back out. I walk sexily up to Brian, “you ready?”<br />
He nods his head again, and I help him up. Once he’s up, I flop down on the couch, spreading out my legs wide, and put out my hand in a sexy summoning gesture. He waddles over, and uses both his hands to line his dick up with my pussy.<br />
A concerned loom creeps onto his face, “I don’t think it will fit,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about that, I took care of it,” I reassure him. He nods, and begins pressing his dick into me. I feel immense pleasure, almost immediately feeling an orgasm. He keeps pushing in, and I can feel my hips being pushed out wider. It keeps moving, and I can feel it sliding up towards my belly, and then up my chest. I can see my body bulging out from it. It keep moving, reaching my breasts, where it begins to stretch them out. He eventually makes it all the way in, his penis throbs throughout my body. He then begins sliding back out, then back in, then back out again, picking up the pace. I feel myself orgasm with each thrust, and my whole body stretching out wildly. Eventually he cums, filling my entire body with cum, and lots of it comes leaking out of my pussy. He slowly slides out, both of us panting heavily.</p>
