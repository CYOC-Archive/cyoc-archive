<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Tony was worried that his wife of almost thirty years was no longer in love with him. His wife, Emily, stopped sleeping in the bed with him about a week ago. She used the spare shower and bathroom, and wore loose clothing. Her mood and behavior was also very odd. This from a woman who loved their weekend love making with her husband and until recently seemed quite satisfied. Tony looked at the calendar and knew this Saturday would be five weeks. Ever since Emily went to the craft fair with a few friends she worked with, she has been different. Tony took Friday off from work, and made his mind to confront Emily on Thursday night. Tony found a note about dinner in the refrigerator and that she would be home late when he arrived home that Thursday afternoon. Tony took the opportunity to explore the spare bedroom that Emily had been using for the past few weeks. He found a key in a drawer, but kept looking for what that key would go to, since the only safe in the house was a combination safe. Tony found nothing that would use a key, going under the bed, through the closet, and through the attached bathroom. Tony sat down at the dining room table, and put the key on the table in front of him. It was nearly 11pm and Emily still was not home. He had spent hours going through her stuff with nothing to explain anything except this key. Tony picked up the key and went to the kitchen. The kitchen had several items that Emily had purchased from nick-knack shops through the years. Tony examined several items before finding a key slot inside the bread box. Tony quickly inserted and turned the key, releasing the panel to flip up. The hidden panel revealed a very realistic horsecock dildo, but just the shaft and a long tether, no balls.  Tony exhaled slowly as he grabbed the dildo and pulled it out from its locked home. Tony smelled the shaft, and it smelled like the inside of a bread box. Tony pushed the loaf of bread back into the breadbox and took his prize to their bedroom to find a place to stash it. Tony was standing in front of his wife&#39;s part of the master bathroom when he saw the tip of the dildo seemed wet in the mirror. He looked down and there was nothing visible, but clearly in the mirror there was a dampness. Tony brought the tip of the dildo to his nose, it was not the breadbox smell, but a tinge of musk. Tony licked the top of the dildo, the flared head was too big to fit into his mouth, but he puckered his lips and tried to suck from the spot that was a plugged hole, but in the mirror it was not plugged. Tony felt the salty and slick fluid slowly flow onto his tongue.  Just as Tony started to suckle harder, he looked up and saw what he was doing in the mirror, and pulled the dildo quickly from his lips. Tony turned out the lights and got ready for bed, carrying the dildo the entire time. Tony crawled into bed and quickly began to suckle on the fake hole in the flared tip as he laid in bed. Tony could wrap his lips around the tip and suckled on the steady stream offered by the dildo. Tony heard Emily come in and go to her room, but it was very late.<br />
<br />
    Tony did not remember falling asleep, but the flared cock of the dildo was at the back of his throat. He saw the clock was almost 9am, and Emily would have left by now. Tony got up and went to relieve himself in the bathroom. Tony stood in front of the toilet with the dildo still in his mouth as he held is own penis for a while as he drained his bladder. Tony flushed and stood in front of his wife&#39;s sink to wash his hands when he saw his face. There was no stubble on the baby smooth skin of his cheeks. Tony began to tug on the dildo in his mouth, trying his best to get the tip past his teeth without being too painful in stretching his jaw open. With the dildo removed, Tony could not close his mouth fully, as his lips were retaining an O shape when fully relaxed. He had to push his lips together to seal, but he could not close his jaw. Tony saw his reflection in the mirror was naked. Tony looked down at his shorts, and slid them off and was now naked in front of the mirror. Tony stared at his reflection in the mirror as the reflection was holding the middle of the dildo, bent over, and reached around and put the tip of the dildo at the opening of his ass. Tony felt the tip of the dildo at the entrance to his ass, then as he relaxed and pushed a little, the tip of the dildo slid inside. Tony watched the mirror as his reflection worked the dildo deeper and deeper until only the tether remained, and then both Tony and reflection stood straight up, and the flared tip bulged his belly where it was pushing against him. Tony and his reflection then grabbed his small, but now very moist and slick cock, and started masturbating. Tony was not even hard when the first stream squirted out and hit the mirror. Tony slowly stepped backwards and sat on the toilet, his growing but not yet rigid cock oozing a slow flow from the throbbing tip of his cock as he slowly worked his hand on his shaft.</p>
