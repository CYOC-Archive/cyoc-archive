<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ricky(Nicki) nods her head. “I do. I don’t know why, but I feel really warm right now… down there. Did you do something to me again.” <br />
<br />
“No, the device is still in my bag. I just barely pulled my swim trunks out. As you see, I haven’t even put them on.” Max replied. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) reaches down and softly touches his lips. He let out a tender moan as the sensation of his fingers reached him. “Sorry bro, I got to do something.” <br />
<br />
Max nods his head as he recalls a memory from their new lives. He remembers years before, when the two of them were first entering puberty. He recalls Ricky(Nicki) having bad cramps at night and his parents buying him a body pillow, saying that it would help make his twin sister more comfortable. Unfortunately, the first night, Max remembers waking up to Ricky(Nicki) moaning as she grinded the pillow. That night, Ricky(Nicki) road the pillow to her first orgasm, and that lead to the twins to their tradition of masturbating together as Ricky(Nicki) noises always made Max horny as well. <br />
<br />
“Come on, ‘sis’, lets get this over with.” Max says, as he pulls his twin over to the side and away from the bed.<br />
 <br />
Max leads Ricky(Nicki) to the opening to the bathroom of the room, hoping that the tile floors would be easier to clean then the carpet of main room. The two take a seat on the ground, leaning on the wall that separates the bedroom and the bathroom. Ricky(Nicki), having taken her hand away from herself for the moment, replaces it near her lips as she returns to playing with herself. Her free hand grabs the closest breast, gently massaging it. <br />
<br />
Max on the other hand, take ahold of his cock as it slowly grows hard. The 6-inch member thickens first as blood rushes to it. It slowly starts to extend out as he moves his fingers along its length. Veins start to become visible along the shaft as the mushroom head expands with his growing heartrate. Once it reaches it 8.75 length, Max’s breathing matches his slow strokes, slow and methodical. <br />
<br />
Max turns his head to look at Ricky(Nicki), finding that is twin is now several fingers inside herself. The breast that Ricky(Nicki) had started massaging is now in her mouth as she squeezes the other. With each breath out, Ricky(Nicki) moans as her body pules in rhythm of her breaths. Tears form in her eyes as all these sensations build inside her. Ricky(Nicki) wants more, but her own hands and mouth she had to service herself. <br />
<br />
Max hesitates before lending a hand to his twin. Max’s memories recall him having to help Ricky(Nicki) sometimes, as she would get stuck on the edge. Taking his free hand and moves Ricky(Nicki)’s out of the way. He then starts rubbing his twin’s feminine lips, as Ricky(Nicki) places both his hands on a breast. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Ricky(Nicki) moans out, still in her euphoria.<br />
 <br />
Max could tell that he was close, his penis pulsing and balls tightening. What he didn’t know was if his twin was. Max’s face twitches as his cock prepares for his release. He looks at his twin one last time to see that her tilting backwards. <br />
<br />
With a grunt and a moan, the two came on the bathroom floor. Max fires his seed along the tiles, up to the other wall. Several waves of seeds were flung across, his balls bouncing off the floor and his thighs. Ricky(Nicki)’s starts to pour out of her, onto her twin&#39;s fingers, her own thighs and the floor. She squeezed tightly on her breasts as small droplets of milk came from her nipples. <br />
<br />
Max gets up and grabs a small towel to get wet. He starts clean the mess they made as Ricky(Nicki) wraps her arms around herself. Max wipes off his twin’s lips and legs before his still hard cock. He then wipes the floor and wall as Ricky(Nicki) slowly lays down on the now clean floor, curled up. <br />
<br />
As max throws the towel in the corner, he looks on Ricky(Nicki) wondering what was wrong. “Are you okay? That was what you wanted, right?” <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) nods his head. “Yes, but…” The tears of ecstasy from before change to that of confusion. “I was thinking of how it would be nice to have someone in me. Not you, but another guy. But I am straight. Why?” <br />
<br />
“You are also my sister right now. That should be normal. You have to have similar memories as me, so you know that you look at guys differently right now.” As Max spoke, he couldn’t help but think how cute his sister looked. He knew any guy worth something would want this girl that was in front of him. Even curled you, she looked like she was inviting someone with her nude body. Her plump butt, pushing her lips out. Her hips already show some curve, and her breasts lay softly on the floor. If she wasn’t her twin, he would love a girl like this. <br />
<br />
“Look, we both just came. So, why don’t we go swim a little bit, get a bite to eat, and play in the arcade. Not necessarily in that order, but still.” Max reaches out his hand to pick up his twin. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) takes the hand and stands up. The two twins give each other a quick lookover of the other’s body. Ricky(Nicki) then nods her head again, “Oh, you are so being a girl once we reach the state park to go camping.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, in the meantime, let’s see what else the device can do. We can change reality.” Max replies. <br />
<br />
“Lets get dress first, then we will talk.” Ricky(Nicki) replies as she covers her breasts with an arm and her lower lips with the other. “I feel a little exposed.” <br />
<br />
“After all that?” Max jokes. “Let&#39;s go.” <br />
<br />
The two return to their respective beds to put on their swimming clothes. Max slides on his red trunks, with his cock now soft again, as Ricky(Nicki) slips into her pink bikini bottoms. As she picks up her top, she looks down to see that her breasts still had some milk on them. She rushes to the bathroom to wipe them off before putting the top on. She had to adjust the top quite a bit, as her nipples kept on showing. Max leans over, “What’s wrong?” <br />
<br />
“Nothing.” Ricky(Nicki) replies. Ricky(Nicki) starts to wonder if she was producing milk or it was just some discharge. She returned to her bed, grabbing her phone, and placing it into a waterproof armband. She sees that Max did the same thing but adding the device in too. The device blended in with the phone, making it look like the phone just had a large case. Ricky(Nicki) then grabs a beach cover to put over her shoulders and breasts. “I’m ready.” <br />
<br />
“Okay, let&#39;s go. Just don’t break to many hearts out there ‘sis’.” Max jokes. <br />
<br />
“Don’t get us kicked out due to your ‘snake’, bro.” Ricky(Nicki) fires back, with max having an obvious outline.</p>
