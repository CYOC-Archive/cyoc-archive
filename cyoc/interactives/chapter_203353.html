<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timothy was the first to wake up, anxious about how far back his parents took him and Caitlyn. His feet, once able to be outside the twin-size bed, had been moved inside with room to spare. As he had slept naked due to the knowledge of the Pubertaway, Timothy felt the smooth legs that were under the sheets. He removed the sheets, willing to examine what the rest of his body became. His body hair, once plentiful, had disappeared completely. His limbs appeared slightly pudgy, with his torso containing traces of fat. His figure had thinned when puberty arrived, and Timothy realized that he had returned to his chubby days.<br />
<br />
More changes were present on his head. His face rounded considerably and became slightly puffy. His buzzcut had evolved, or rather devolved, into the long and messy hair that his mom kept combing relentlessly. There would always be one group sticking out no matter the efforts from him or his mom. His moderately kempt beard was replaced with the minefield of freckles that had dominated his face. Without a doubt, Timothy was a child again.<br />
<br />
He looked over to his sister, still asleep and oblivious to the changes. Unlike her brother, Caitlyn chose to cover up, though her clothes were too big for her at that point. Her hair had shortened and altered to a lighter shade of ginger. Her chest had deflated completely, making her ineligible for training bras, let alone real ones.<br />
<br />
Realizing the time, and hearing his parents prepare breakfast, Timothy rushed to his sister&#39;s bed. Disregarding his prepubescent voice, and the fact that he was still naked, Timothy alerted his sister at the top of his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;CAITLYN! WAKE UP, SIS! MOM AND DAD MADE US KIDS AGAIN! YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annoyed, Caitlyn scowled at his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, can you not scream at me? I&#39;m trying to sleep...&quot; Caitlyn paused as soon as her eyes opened. Her eyes widened prior to examining her diminished figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, what happened to us? Are we...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything that puberty did to us is gone. Your breasts, my voice, everything. Hell, my balls rose back up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, could you please not show me that?! At least wear a shirt to cover it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy was on his way to fetch one of his now too-large shirts when he observed a pile of clothes next to where the parents placed the Pubertaway. A pair of brown camo shorts and a green t-shirt with a jungle motif were meant for Timothy, while the pair of jeans and a orange shirt with a floral pattern was intended for Caitlyn. Boys and girls underwear were also in the pile. When Timothy observed the shirt, he had realized that it was several sizes smaller than normal, as were the shorts. Wondering if those clothes would fit, Timothy threw the girly clothes towards his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like mom and dad planned ahead, so put these on,&quot; Timothy ordered, &quot;I&#39;m not spending the whole summer wearing oversized clothes or naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Minutes later, the regressed twins left their bedroom. The breakfast was already ready, and Timothy observed two packed bags nearby the front door. Having set the Pubertaway to Mode 3, their parents gave them smaller portions of the waffles and bacon prepared that day. Both Timothy and Caitlyn were curious about what their parents had in store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom, dad, what&#39;re the bags over there for?&quot; Timothy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well kids, your mother and I have planned this out all month, and we remember how you two have always wanted to go to summer camp,&quot; their father said, &quot;But we could never take you because it was too expensive even for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now that we have the money, and the two of you are of the right age again, you&#39;re finally going to camp,&quot; their mother announced, &quot;The bags are out because it starts today, so we&#39;ll head out as soon as you guys are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprised and delighted by the news, both Timothy and Caitlyn scarfed down their breakfast and were finished in less than a minute. In his haste, Timothy left behind a puddle of syrup on his face, which he instinctively wiped off with his hand. The twins, now a pair of excited 10-year-olds, left the apartment with their parents and drove off within minutes.<br />
<br />
Going to camp was perfect in the twins&#39; eyes. With their friends on the other side of puberty and no child friendly amenities nearby their building, their days would have otherwise consisted of video games and junk food, which neither of them wanted. To Caitlyn, this was also a break from having her chest feel like they were carrying sandbags. She also knew that she&#39;d miss her monthly, but that was another thing that she&#39;d gladly have a break over. As for Timothy, maintaining his beard nightly felt like a chore, but his hairless body meant a chance to remove shaving from his routine. He also did not have to worry about hiding his erections as his penis remained flaccid for the entire day, and he was unable to get it erect at all.<br />
<br />
Four hours later, the twins finally arrived, among a sea of eager campers and not-so-eager counselors. The counselors were about as tall as the twins used to be, with ages ranging between the twins&#39; former age of 18 to early 20s. The campers, with ages ranging between 8 and 15, waited anxiously to learn what groups they&#39;d be assigned to.<br />
<br />
Knowing that they were going to be separated soon, Caitlyn leaned into Timothy and whispered, &quot;Remember not to tell anyone we just graduated high school or about that Pubertaway. The whole camp thinks we&#39;re 10 years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; Timothy replied, &quot;We&#39;ll just say we go to South Hayden Elementary &#39;cause that&#39;s where we went.&quot;<br />
<br />
When called up, the twins introduced themselves as Timmy and Caity, which they believed would help sell the façade of them being really 10. As per protocol, the twins were separated into different groups. Caity was assigned to an all-girls group where the campers are all 10-11, while Timmy was sent to an all-boys group with the same age range. They introduced themselves as planned, and the groups went on their way to the first activity of the day.</p>
