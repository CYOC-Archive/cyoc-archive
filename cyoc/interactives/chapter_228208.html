<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some things never really changed, and to a degree, even with all the changes that went on after the appearance of Animalia, that sort of thing applied. For while the often-radical transformations from mundane animal or Human to Animalian was a major change in form and even at times behavior. And there were often fairly obvious reasons for why some people might want to become Animalians on that basis. Animalians were all uniformly fit and muscular and having a fair amount of energy for a great many things. Females also didn&#39;t lose their feminine shape as they gained the muscles that went with the transformation, and in fact many Human women found their curves enhanced when becoming Animalians. It was always something that was taken as major plus those that converted to become Animalians to deal with weight issues.<br />
<br />
And Judy had seen that plenty of times over the years as people came into Horizon to become Animalians. Some of the first were among the various &quot;furry&quot; community that simply wanted to gain the animal features that would come with being an Animalian, but there were also those that had been overweight. Their reasoning was likely in recognition that they had messed up or let themselves go in some way, that had led to them putting on weight or failing to lose weight. It wasn&#39;t always the result of being lazy, as there were some, like Animalia&#39;s Deputy Mayor&#39;s wife that had had other health issues that made losing weight near impossible. The conversion would then provide a major &quot;cure&quot; in many ways. Those that had been overweight because of a sedentary lifestyle got to lose that weight and those that had been overweight because of other issues had those issues resolved. It was something that fit in with many aspects of Project Phoenix.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re ready for a new you?&quot; Judy asked to the latest arrival to come into Horizon for conversion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s something that&#39;s always plagued me,&quot; the man spoke as he adjusted his polo shirt, &quot;I&#39;ve always liked food and well... I just never seemed to get the energy to change for it... even when I knew it wasn&#39;t great and I didn&#39;t want to get this big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded and looked him over. The man was about as tall as she was, but was obviously far more rotund, and in some ways it looked as though it had also been something going on for years. As it looked like his ankles were also rather swollen in the oversized tennis shoes he wore and the oversized pair of slacks that his polo shirt was tucked into.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Animalia was your way out?&quot; Judy asked, &quot;Mr. Flummbas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lose the weight and get the energy to keep it off, yeah,&quot; the man, Mr. Flummbas, answered with a small chuckle, &quot;and with one that I&#39;ve always found as rather cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... that was something that seemed a bit surprising,&quot; Judy commented, &quot;I mean, one would have thought that if you were to make this choice... you would have made it last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;d imagine becoming a Mountain Cottontail would work better in the Year of the Rabbit, but I had a fair amount of work and things going on last year,&quot; Mr. Flummbas answered, &quot;that kept me busy enough that I wasn&#39;t quite as bad as I am now... bad, maybe, but not this bad. But then things began to get less hectic later in the year... and I&#39;ll admit to having indulged a bit more than normal over Thanksgiving and Christmas... it left me... well... bigger than normal by New Years, and well... I had to realize that I needed to get the weight off and get the energy to keep it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
They approached one of the doors to the conversion rooms, where one aide was there with a stack of clothes in her arms. Judy nodded to her, though, more as an instruction for the aide to wait there until after the conversion was completed. Judy led Mr. Flummbas into the room. He carefully moved over to the bed and sat down while Judy readied the delivery of the Animalia Virus that would allow for his conversion. This started with readying an alcohol swab to prep the site where Judy would deliver the shots for Mr. Flummbas&#39; two doses. The needles were safe in a plastic container in the jacket of Judy&#39;s white jacket. As she was ready, she noted that the man had pulled up his shirt sleeve and had his shoulder exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shot won&#39;t be painful,&quot; Judy told him as she swabbed the exposed shoulder, &quot;and the transformation won&#39;t hurt... Some things may feel odd, but it won&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Flummbas nodded as Judy then produced the plastic box that contained the syringes. From there she took out each syringe, removed the safety cap and then delivered the shot. The second shot was given after the first and from there, Judy made her way out. The aide was waiting for her as she came out and flipped the one small lock on the outside of the door. It wasn&#39;t much, and probably wouldn&#39;t permanently hold against a large Animalian trying to go through the door. But it would serve against accidents and buy time for Horizon&#39;s own security measures to come into place if a new Animalian had a sort of reaction similar to what had happened when Heather first became a Dinotopian. Though, Judy didn&#39;t think that Mr. Flummbas would pose that much of a threat. Rabbits weren&#39;t particularly large or aggressive.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this one should be the last of the day?&quot; the aide asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last of many for the day,&quot; Judy nodded, &quot;it would seem that people will still come to Animalia to lose weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Horizon certainly found a way to make a profitable weight loss solution,&quot; the aide chuckled, &quot;and from all the reports, those that have become Animalians have also found the energy and determination to not fall into old habits again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what will this one be?&quot; the aide asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Mountain Cottontail,&quot; Judy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be good for you,&quot; the aide elbowed Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Judy protested, wanting to try and retain some professionalism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t protest,&quot; the aide replied, &quot;You&#39;ve done all you can to care and help... You took a day off to help that one girl from Animalia Ambassadoria become an Animalian... Jessica, I believe her name was... You helped see to it that Rockwall would go see Bunni Clair, and the two of them are married now. I think you have a right to have a mate for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would have to depend on the personality of the person,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;just because he&#39;s becoming the same species of rabbit as me, that doesn&#39;t mean he will want me.&quot;<br />
<br />
They waited a few moments before there was a tap at the door. Judy then turned to it and heard Mr. Flummbas&#39;s voice from the inside say that he was done. Judy eventually undid the lock and opened the door to find a well-toned male gray-brown Rabbit Animalian standing there while holding an oversized pair of pants over his waist. The fur was pristine and luxurious, and that began to get a bit of a flutter out of Judy&#39;s heart. He gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a bit small around the waist now,&quot; Mr. Flummbas spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;He made up for it with his shoulders,&quot; Judy silently thought to herself and then spoke, &quot;we should have spare clothes that will fit... and would be good for a while. They&#39;ll give you time to buy a new wardrobe that would be to your liking Mr. Flum...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me, Nick,&quot; Mr. Flummbas answered, &quot;as you&#39;ve done a lot to be friendly and understanding with me... there&#39;s no need to be formal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am presently working,&quot; Judy pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... but still, thank you, for all you&#39;ve done,&quot; Nick Flummbas answered.</p>
