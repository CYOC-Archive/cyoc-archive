<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The machine was broken...&quot; Eric whimpered, his face pressed against Adam&#39;s mighty chest, &quot;Your father broke it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Adam replied. He grabbed the back of Eric&#39;s head and directed the much smaller man&#39;s mouth towards one of his jutting nips. As Eric took the hint and began to suck, Adam continued speaking. &quot;We all knew about the machine. But dad kept the details to himself. But I kept asking and asking, getting more and more clues and hints about it. Until finally I had your name. After that, it was easy track you down. Not many five-foot tall men named Eric Sorensen. And once you saw me and called me by my dad&#39;s name, I was sure I had the right guy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s head was spinning. Even though twenty years had passed, he could never forget the fateful day when he had tested his machine on Steve. It should have been his day of triumph, the culmination of years of work; even though he had only been twenty-five at the time, he&#39;d been working on it since high school, when he realized he faced being stuck at five feet tall and a hundred pounds for the rest of his life. But all that work had been dashed to pieces when Steve destroyed half the lab after abusing the machine. The scene replayed itself in Eric&#39;s head regularly--it filled his dreams; sometimes those dreams were erotic and pleasant, other times they were frightful nightmares. <br />
<br />
Adam continued to monologue. &quot;And now that I&#39;ve found you, Dr. Sorensen--Eric--you&#39;re going to rebuild that machine. And you&#39;re going to make me bigger with it! Don&#39;t think you have a choice in this, Eric, because you don&#39;t. You&#39;re going to do what I want, and that&#39;s that. You understand me? You. Will. Do. What. I. WANT!&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric pulled off of Adam&#39;s nip. He looked up, and saw the young hulk peering down at him, face looking determined and vaguely threatening. &quot;Of course I will try...&quot; Eric replied cautiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Adam growled, &quot;None of this &#39;try&#39; bullshit, Eric. You WILL repair the machine!&quot; He wrapped his powerful arms around Eric and pulled him in close, his crushing strength mashing Eric against his powerful body. &quot;Have I made myself clear, Eric?&quot; he demanded. <br />
<br />
Eric nodded. &quot;Clear as crystal, sir,&quot; he replied, sounding meek and obedient, &quot;The machine will be repaired.&quot; <br />
<br />
Adam kept his arms wrapped around Eric, but the crushing pressure lessened. &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Adam purred, &quot;That makes me happy. And don&#39;t worry, Eric, I will make you happy too. You can worship me, now and after you&#39;ve succeeded. I&#39;ll even fuck you, if you want. After you earn it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; Eric replied. <br />
<br />
* * * <br />
<br />
Eric stepped back from the machine, wiping sweat off his face with a handkerchief. He&#39;d worked on it for a week straight, pausing only to eat, catch a few hours of sleep, and give his lectures. He&#39;d cancelled his office hours, skipped out on department meetings, and only remembered to shower once in the whole week. <br />
<br />
Twenty years of technological change had finally allowed him to rebuild his machine, at a fraction of the original cost no less. Without access to a proper university laboratory, he had settled for assembling it in the garage of his house, leaving his car outside of it. Adam had moved in as well, making sure that Eric&#39;s progress did not falter. Adam had teased Eric quite a bit at first, walking around without a shirt, then without pants, striding through the house only in underwear that hugged his mighty glutes and hefty bulge. But as the week went on Adam became bored with &quot;all that mad-science crap&quot; that Eric was doing, and increasingly left the smaller man alone for hours at a time. Without Adam&#39;s body as a distraction, Eric made incredible progress. By Saturday, he was finally finished and ready to test it. <br />
<br />
Eric stood in front of his machine. It was more compact than before--a benefit of newer, smaller components, particularly the computers. He had completely changed the interface and modernized some of the capabilities--the Male Magnification Machine 2.0 would be better than the first in every way--if Eric&#39;s calculations were correct, that is. <br />
<br />
He considered calling in Adam for the test. But as Eric stared at the machine, he scowled. Steve had been a test subject, and everything had gone awry. Eric had always intended the machine for himself--not for young musclemen who were already three of four times bigger than he was! He entered the commands into the control console, and walked over to the machine, which was slowly warming up. He pulled off his shirt and kicked off his pants, prepared to say goodbye to his small, skinny body forever. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on in here?&quot; came Adam&#39;s voice. Eric&#39;s head whipped around. Adam was standing in the doorway to the garage, wearing only a jockstrap, scowling. &quot;Is the machine ready to be tested yet?&quot; he asked, as he did every day. He noticed that Eric was only in his underwear. Realization dawned on him. &quot;You little fuck...&quot; the young muscleman growled.<br />
<br />
Eric ran to the machine. Beams of light came out of dozens of emitters, bathing him in radiance, blinding him. He let out a howl, his skin feeling like it was burning up from the heat of the machine&#39;s rays. For a fraction of a second, he wondered if he had miscalculated, if his eagerness to improve his machine had led him astray, away from what was tried and true. Then he felt himself start to grow. <br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s howl of pain became a groan of pleasure. His body drank in the light from his machine, using it to power him up. He grew taller and broader, strength like he had never known before growing in his body. He let out a low laugh of delight, marveling at how different his voice was: lower, deeper, richer, sexier. &quot;Oh yessss...&quot; he purred, as the machine finished its cycle. The lights dimmed and then went out entirely. Eric&#39;s vision returned. <br />
<br />
Adam was standing right in front of him, his face an angry snarl. It was a jolt of surprise for Eric when he realized he was looking *down* at Adam. The snarl vanished, replaced by shock, as Adam had a similar realization: that he was looking *up* at Eric! <br />
<br />
Adam scrambled backwards, eyes wide, jaw hanging open. He looked over at one of the screens on the machine, which confirmed what his eyes were showing him: Eric was 7&#39;6&quot; tall and 600 pounds of massive, bloated muscle. He had 30-inch biceps, a 70-inch chest, and 40-inch quads. His underwear had shredded off during the transformation, and his erect, eleven-inch dick bobbed in front of him. <br />
<br />
Adam looked back at Eric, watching the big man stagger forward, his huge thighs rubbing together as he walked. His gait was awkward as he struggled to become accustomed to his new size. &quot;You were supposed to grow ME!&quot; Adam protested, anger returning to him. <br />
<br />
Eric looked down at him, eyes flashing dangerously. &quot;The machine was always for myself,&quot; he replied coldly, &quot;Until your idiot sire wrecked it!&quot; He lurched toward Adam, grabbing the younger and now comparably smaller man, pulling him in close. &quot;I wasn&#39;t supposed to spend the last twenty years small and weak,&quot; he growled, &quot;I was supposed to be big! Strong! Virile! I was going to fuck studs and twinks and everything in between!&quot; He looked down at Adam. &quot;I have a lot of lost time to make up for, boy. And I think I&#39;ll start making it up with you...&quot; He pulled Adam in close, mashing the other man&#39;s face against his massive chest while his eleven inches rubbed up against Adam&#39;s abs. &quot;You said your larger brothers make you worship them? Then you should be really experienced at making me feel good, little man...&quot;</p>
