<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The caller ID showed it was his friend Caleb from across the street.  They had known each other since they <br />
were 3 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dave, you want to come over?  I'm trying to find a party to go to but I can't seem to find one.  I think <br />
we ought to organize it this time, instead of last time's when my parents got home before planned.  We should <br />
invite the rest of the football team and the cheerleading squad as usual.  What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave wasn't up to going, he felt so weak, but he tried to hold firm and said, &quot;Yeah, sure.  I'll be there in a <br />
couple of minutes.&quot;  Again, he forgot to take off his shirt, but now it fit him, so there were no worries.  He <br />
guessed he would probably just look more preppy.<br />
<br />
Once he arrived, Caleb opened the door and looked shocked.  &quot;How did you get so short?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't but I don't think it matters,&quot; Dave replied, &quot;Let's get to work on this party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
After finally setting up for the party, Dave had to go to the bathroom again, but this time he wouldn't leave <br />
so fortunate.  First off, he had to vomit again, and did.  After doing so, he had zero visible muscle mass and <br />
was 5'3&quot;!  He decided to lock the door, he didn't want anyone seeing him like this.  His shorts began to <br />
change in material until they weren't cargo shorts anymore, but they were khaki slack shorts.  His new shorts <br />
began to lengthen until they reached about two inches above his ankles.  <br />
<br />
He wondered what he had been wearing before this.  He always wore khaki slacks, didn't he?  His mom told he <br />
looked really good with them on, didn't she?  His mind was fuzzy, and he decided to try and splash some cold <br />
water on his face.  After drying off his face, he noticed that he was still wearing the same clothes.  <br />
However, his hi-top shoes were changing in color.  They were becoming full black and kind of shiny, almost <br />
like they were made of leather or something.  After a minute of calming himself down, he didn't notice that <br />
the shoes continued changing by shortening some and thinning out until they were ultimately fancy black dress <br />
shoes.<br />
<br />
His socks began to rise as well until they reached his knee.  They also changed in color to a bright white, <br />
clashing with his new black dress shoes.  Subconsciously, Dave began to raise his pant waist until it met the <br />
top of his belly button.  He wanted to see as much of his socks as he could, because he thought they looked <br />
cool.  <br />
<br />
He mind starting feeling fuzzy again, and he rinsed his face with water, only this time to have his vision <br />
shot after doing so.  He couldn't see anything, but tried to find his trusty glasses in his pocket.  He found <br />
his thick black-rimmed glasses and put them on.  He could see again!  He could see the braces on his teeth <br />
that he had forever but didn't have a minute ago.  <br />
<br />
Caleb knocked on the door to ask how he was doing, and Dave replied in a new nasally voice, &quot;Oh, I'm just <br />
excreting a sh-... sh-... uh, some waste.&quot;  He couldn't curse anymore.  <br />
<br />
Caleb replied, &quot;Okay... just take it easy in there...&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave looked at himself in the mirror again, he noticed lots of zits appearing on his face, and he could feel <br />
them starting to run down his back and shoulders.  He tried to feel his shoulders, but all he could feel was <br />
the thick strap of a pair of suspenders clip onto his pant waist on both sides.  They were an ugly forest <br />
green color with red stripes on them.  After noticing them, he noticed that a bowtie appeared on his neck and <br />
began to tie itself on him.  The bowtie was orange and clashed completely with his suspenders.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his skin became a pasty white and freckles appeared all over his body.  The only thing left was his <br />
hair, and he was wondering why it looked so &quot;hip.&quot;  But all of that began to change as his perfect faux hawk <br />
became super oily and greasy, and parted itself down the middle.  His hair also turned bright orange and fell <br />
so that there was no shape in his hair at all.<br />
<br />
His nose stretched out really far and wide to look like a potato nose and his ears doubled size and began to <br />
flop over.  His eyes turned from an emerald green to a muddy brown.<br />
<br />
He pulled out his wallet and noticed that his school ID said &quot;Erwin Elliot / Grade 12&quot;.  The new Erwin began <br />
to have memories flood him of the time he skipped two years of high school.  &quot;It was so good that I didn't <br />
waste those two years of high school actually being in school!&quot; he said in an extremely nasally voice.  Now <br />
being a super nerd, he would have no memories of partying, being on the football team, or flunking classes.  <br />
He was now Erwin Elliot, the Biochemical student who always studied and never played a video game his entire <br />
life.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, but who was it?</p>
