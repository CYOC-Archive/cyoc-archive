<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If Sally was surprised or shocked by Jessy&#39;s enthusiasm, she didn&#39;t show it. She eventually made a smile and asked to Jessy quite calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d want to be magic?&quot; Sally asked, &quot;Some of the power ups I&#39;ve gained to enhance baby furs... is fairly new and we make more friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanooki could talk to animals,&quot; Jessy commented, &quot;that sounds cool and I want to know what they&#39;re thinking about... Maybe make friends with animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; Sally agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be fun,&quot; said Bunnie, &quot;but all mag-gick-ed up furs are to stop the bad things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally nodded, &quot;You may have to give up some things until all the bad things can&#39;t be mean to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know already,&quot; Sammy said slowly, though his absolute awe at being there with the first fur, &quot;I just had the feeling that there was something not quite right with these things... like there was something more to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re like some of the others that have come to me,&quot; Sally turned to Sammy with a bit of surprise, &quot;those who remember bits of who they were and having hints of the bad things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do wish to help you,&quot; Bella commented, &quot;and so will I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll help, Gramma?&quot; Sally asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those who have gained magic will need teaching,&quot; Bella smiled and rubbed Sally&#39;s head, &quot;I will help them the best I can before old age catches up with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled in response. She then turned Sammy and Jessy again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d want to be magic?&quot; Sally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, to talk to animals,&quot; Jessy answered with a smile and excitement radiating from her voice, &quot;Maybe they&#39;d seen something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind being a Kitsune, they&#39;re types of foxes, right?&quot; Sammy answered, &quot;just be with my bestest friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have to be magic to be with Jessy,&quot; Cheetah commented, &quot;Jessy might gain extra powers, but you wouldn&#39;t necessarily loose her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy thought about it for a moment. He really didn&#39;t know about Kitsune all that much besides the fact that they were magical foxes with multiple tails and that they were from Japanese folklore. Though the fact that Kitsune were magical made him wonder what he could do if he had a Kitsune&#39;s powers, and what Charlotte had said about the imps continued to ring in his mind. That they would come after Bella to try and change her and would come after Sally to try and kill her. As as he looked at Sally, with her largely gray fur, her small pointed ears on the top of her head, her large dark eyes, and her own great bushy tail that she held high behind her and air of brightness, kindness, joy, and friendship, Sammy couldn&#39;t let anything happen to Sally. She&#39;d brought so much good to the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t want the imps to get you either,&quot; Sammy commented, &quot;If Jessy and I can trick them or maybe bring the light to them... that&#39;d be a good thing. If we can protect our other friends... I&#39;d do that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy watched as Sally&#39;s eyes began to glow, almost unconsciously so, and she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re both very good,&quot; Sally smiled to both of them, &quot;and if that is truly what you wish... so it shall be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy was then blinded by a great flash of light that wrapped around and entered him. He felt power enter him and then begin to radiate from within him. It made him feel stronger, even though his muscles didn&#39;t grow in the slightest. He just felt stronger than he had, like there was great strength within him. As that power grew within him, his tail began to ache a little, like it was being contained by something. Then it split into two, which swirled behind him. Things felt a bet better but the ache was still there, then his tails split again and became four, then again to become eight, and then finally a ninth tail extended from the center of other tails. The white tips of each red furred brush-like tail glowed as if on fire, though the weren&#39;t. Sammy also felt an odd sense of wisdom enter his mind, though he couldn&#39;t fully picture it. And then the light faded and Sammy the Kitsune Fox settled back down onto his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; was all Sammy could say as he felt all nine of his tails seem to swirl without effort or command and didn&#39;t get in the way of anything. He reached around to feel each of them and they felt real. He marveled at it and said, &quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then looked over at Jessy, and she didn&#39;t look like she&#39;d changed at all. The only thing that had changed on her was that the black fur that made up the &quot;mask&quot;  of a raccoon had now spread to also cover her shoulders, arms, and hands to mirror the Japanese Raccoon Dog,  which was a type of canid and totally unrelated to the Raccoon.  She also seemed to be thinking back on something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessy?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That bear back in Frankie Town,&quot; Jessy said slowly as she thought back to the wild Black Bear that had wandered into the town, saw the baby furs and after awhile wandered back into the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about him?&quot; Sammy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;When he left... he was muttering &quot;what are these little things&quot; like he didn&#39;t know what a baby fur was,&quot; Jessy told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He probably didn&#39;t,&quot; Sammy commented, &quot;he was just a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose he wasn&#39;t a bear... suppose he was an imp in disguise trying to trick us?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
Tanuki, or as the baby furs spelled it, tanooki, were known in Japanese folklore for not only being nature spirits that could talk with animals but also being gifted with powers similar to kitsune in that they could change their shape and form. Tanuki were supposedly even BETTER at this then kitsune were and often used these abilities to fool people to fit rather comical natures. Jessy as a Raccoon Tanooki had those abilities to shape-change, too, but had also gained some ability to see through disguises of any kind as a tanuki&#39;s ability intermixed with the base abilities of baby furs. And the baby fur in Jessy didn&#39;t want to make anyone feel stupid.<br />
<br />
Sammy, as a kitsune had gained all the relevant powers attributed to them, with a host of elemental and transformative magics that he could channel through his hands or through his now nine tails. Though, despite having nine tails, Sammy did not possess the outright god-like abilities that legend attributed to nine-tailed kitsune, though he did feel powerful and like many of his own abilities as a baby fur were also magnified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, it it was an imp, it did a good bear impression and we&#39;ll just have to show him the light,&quot; Sammy said to her, &quot;show him that&#39;s it&#39;s better to be good than bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do ya think we can do it?&quot; Jessy wondered, &quot;make imps good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With Gramma as a teacher, of course we can,&quot; Sammy smiled with reference to Bella, &quot;and maybe even make sure they can&#39;t hurt or transform her either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessy only beamed with excitement. It soon bubbled over and Sammy and Jessy playfully &quot;glomped&quot; Sally in a friendly hug and set all the baby furs into bouncing around the room on the trampoline-like floor. Bella only smiled from the doorway as she followed Sally with her eyes. True, she might not have intended to create baby furs, but Sally was happy and in Bella&#39;s old bones, she could feel all the love and happiness that she had intended for the Golem to share with Sally. That did feel good, and while she didn&#39;t know how much time she had left, she would do all that she could to protect her granddaughter.</p>
