<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex Steelshield Chapter 5<br />
<br />
Alex and David quickly left town, heading directly towards the small hunting lodge in the eastern forests that David told him was the assembly point for a recurring goblin hunting quest. Part of the mission the order had directed him towards, Alex vaguely remembered as he silently trudged along, a few short steps behind his younger brother.<br />
<br />
Part of him wanted to stop and examine in more detail what had happened to his groin, part of him wanted to quit the game with how weird things had been in his first two days of game play, and another part of him wanted to race back to town and try to beat the old priest into reversing his strange curse.<br />
<br />
Alex had not had an opportunity to really examine his now smaller dick, but he could feel the metallic weight keeping his now smaller dick encased and his small balls jutting slightly forward from his body. The cool metallic material had warmed to match his own body temperature at this point.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his dick withering away, heartbeat by heartbeat had been accompanied with a sinking feeling in his gut, but after a little bit of time walking and mulling things over, a spark of strange curiosity was building within him.<br />
<br />
After all this was just a game, so even if he had gotten milked multiple times, had his large 9 inch cock shrunken then locked in chastity, none of this would follow him back to the real world, so why not explore and see what this game could do.<br />
<br />
The thought settling his anxiety down, Alex finally built up the nerve to start talking with David.<br />
<br />
“ Hey,  David...”<br />
Alex started, waiting for his younger brother to stop and look over his shoulder at him.<br />
<br />
“About what happened in the temple..”<br />
Alex  started, not continuing until David gave him a small nod.<br />
“ After Father Donnohan made me...”<br />
His voice trailing off, but seeing David nod continued.<br />
“After he did that, something kinda covered my dick. Do you know what it is?”<br />
A small flicker of amusement flickered across David&#39;s face before it settled into a serious expression.<br />
<br />
“ I&#39;m not sure, I might have to take a quick look at it, if that&#39;s ok with you?”<br />
<br />
“What? Not out here!”<br />
Alex stepped back startled, embarrassment flushing red across his face.<br />
<br />
“No, not out here. We&#39;ll find a spot away from view of the road and I&#39;ll use an appraisal cantrip to tell you what it is.” <br />
David replied before confidently walking off the road into the bushes.<br />
<br />
Alex stood stunned, not having any time to respond<br />
 verbally before slumping his shoulders and following his brother into the woods.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few short minutes later they had found a small clearing surrounded with dense bushes where David unceremoniously stopped, turned around and raised his hands.<br />
<br />
Wisps of blue, orange and green smoke started to dance in David&#39;s palms as silently mouthed the incantation, staring expectantly at his older brother who just stood there watching.<br />
<br />
And watching.<br />
<br />
Until David tilted his head slightly with an annoyed look.<br />
“You have to open your pants so I can direct the appraisal magic. I&#39;m only level 1 so cant do any fancy stuff like appraise through multiple layers of clothing or armour.”<br />
<br />
Alex gulped and nodded before slowly removing part of his armor and pulling his underwear down slightly.<br />
<br />
David wasted no time, directing the smoke towards his brothers crotch, the smoke swirling around and entering within the small spaces inside the black cage, tickling Alex&#39;s diminished member and its accompanying grape sized balls.<br />
<br />
Suddenly A pop up window appeared before both of them.<br />
<br />
[ Magic item – Blight absorbing chastity cage.<br />
The cage absorbs blights and prevents erections for the wearer. <br />
If not dispelled by the applying caster, will dissipate within (Rolled 1d8 +6,Result 10)  in game days.<br />
Underlying Penis 2inches flaccid, 4 inches erect.<br />
5 inches taken during the purification ritual by PRIEST OF SLAANESH.<br />
Size will return in 1d2 inch increments each day.<br />
Size return currently prevented by presence of chastity cage.<br />
Size return will be delayed until cage has been dispelled.]<br />
<br />
Alex and David both stood frozen reading everything, Alex reading slower until he felt another tickling breeze around his groin.<br />
Looking down he found his younger brother kneeling down and examining the cage in more detail.<br />
His face about a foot in front of his older brother encaged cock.<br />
<br />
“Fascinating...” David muttered before Alex hurriedly covered himself, reapplying his armour.<br />
<br />
“Dude, don&#39;t do weird shit like that!”<br />
Alex exclaimed,  his face red with embarrassment.<br />
As he grabbed David by the shoulder and started marching him back towards the road.<br />
Ignoring David&#39;s flustered explanations and requests to appraise more of the situation.<br />
<br />
“ I know that things will be back to normal in time so lets go play the game already.”<br />
Alex angrily responded, silencing David as they marched along the road further.<br />
<br />
<br />
A little bit later they both paused to eat the excused them selves to take a piss separately.<br />
<br />
Alex stood behind one tree, the arm metal held in his hands as he marvelled how small his dick looked in the shiny black metal cage.<br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t been this smalls since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old.” He mused to himself.<br />
“ without the pubic hair this would be an absolute kiddie dick.” <br />
He chuckled slightly, letting his urine stream from the small opening at the end of the cage, letting the stream die down to a trickle before starting to reapply his underwear.<br />
Then as his fingers graced his balls, a sudden twinge of arousal shot through him, the small piece of flesh suddenly flooding with blood, filling out before suddenly reaching the confines of the metal cage, unable to get more then a half chub before the tightness caused a dull pain in his small grape like balls.<br />
“Well, I guess I am as horny as I normally am.”<br />
Alex muttered, stuffing  his caged piece back into his armour again.<br />
<br />
At the same time David was behind another tree about a hundred metres away.<br />
He hands rapidly stroking up and down his hard dick.<br />
Having pissed as quickly as possible, he could no longer wait to explore his enlarged manhood.<br />
<br />
His now 7inch piece of meat pulsed with heat in his hand.<br />
A hand that had previously had to pinch his little micro dick between his fingers was now holding his thick hard tool with a closed grip. The thumb barely reaching the index fingers wrapped around the shaft.<br />
<br />
Visions of his brothers shrunken cock, his face flushed red in embarrassment, the power he already felt in this situation filled David&#39;s mind as he rapidly approached orgasm.<br />
His now normal size balls pulsing with urgent need, not yet used to producing this amount of semen but eager to release and produce more.<br />
<br />
Vision of how he was going to bend his cocky older brother to his whim swam around in his head as the pressure within his balls reached a fever pitch, before thick semen exploded from his cock, painting the tree in front of him with thick white ropes.<br />
<br />
David ended up biting his lip to stifle himself from crying out in pleasure.<br />
His tiny micro dick had felt good shooting little dribbles of cum in the past, but his new thick cock sent jolts of pleasure down its full hard length and right through his brain.<br />
<br />
Panting hard David struggled to catch his breath, as the post nut clarity hit.<br />
So this was how it felt to have  big dick. <br />
And he had been denied that kind of pleasure.<br />
A small pit of anger started to burn in his chest at the thought.<br />
Why shouldn&#39;t I get to experience that, and more?<br />
Why should pleasure be so limited for some people?<br />
<br />
“David?”<br />
Alex&#39;s voice rang out through the bushes.<br />
Alex realising he had taken too much time quickly adjusted his robes, turning towards the clearing his brother was in.<br />
<br />
Then...<br />
<br />
All sound stopped.<br />
The world appeared to shift from colour into mutes tones of black, white and grey.<br />
And standing in front of David was the only being of colour in this monochromatic world.<br />
<br />
Towering over him at approximately 10 feet tall.<br />
A large feminine figure, pink slick flesh with ridged of latex black trailing down their body.<br />
David couldn&#39;t tell if the latex like material was clothing or part of her skin.<br />
Large eyes, with pupils shimmering with shifting shades of gold, pink and green, within the black sea that was her irises drew David&#39;s attention deeper as he stood transfixed. Unable to respond and the form shifted, bending down and reaching out a long slender hand, with razor like claws. Single claw like nail caressed David&#39;s chin.<br />
<br />
“My dear sweet little Daivd. I see you out here, working on your little plans and schemes. Against a world that doesn&#39;t care, that denies you what others get. A world that for others if full of so much colour but for those denied is so...”<br />
<br />
The figure&#39;s voice stopped as it gestured to the world around them.<br />
David, finally able to turn his gaze from the creatures eyes took a moment to examine the world around, seeing the lack of colour and movement, realising that at this moment time was stopped for all but the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Bland.”<br />
David finished the sentence, his voice far more forceful then he had intended, but the small pit of anger in his chest prevented him form being fully overcome with fear.<br />
<br />
“Exactly my dear sweet child. Which is why I have come to you. To help you add a little dash of colour into this world.”<br />
The being smiled as it reached its hand out to the tree David has just ejaculated on, scooping up a large blog of the semen that had been frozen and prevented from trailing down the tree. The tree itself suddenly returning to normal colours, its branches rustling from an unseen wind.<br />
<br />
Drawing the claw like finger into her mouth, the being moaned in pleasure as it licked the still hot semen off its claws.<br />
<br />
“This is the pleasure I hope you will spread across the world my chosen one. Pleasure that others cannot yet comprehend. Pleasure that will consume all and bring a new golden age across this land.”<br />
The <br />
Being stretched its arms toward the sky, its breasts jiggling seductively before turning their gaze back down toward David.<br />
“ As I envision it, you shall make make it happen.”<br />
Drawing their face closer to his until suddenly their hot breath tickled David&#39;s ear. Their voice dropping to a whisper.<br />
<br />
“Simply name me and the pact will be sealed. Name me and I will aim you.<br />
Name me and you will no longer be a pact less warlock, but shall bend others for your own pleasure.”<br />
She chuckled as her voice sent subtle vibrations down David&#39;s neck.<br />
Despite being completely Gay he found himself shudder slightly, the feeling of arousal starting to build within him.<br />
<br />
This was a being a pure lust and pleasure.<br />
A being he had thoroughly researched on his previous characters before their untimely deaths in the game.<br />
<br />
“Slaanesh.”<br />
<br />
The word was out of his mouth as he thought it.<br />
The mere utterance causing a shock wave to spread from this mouth, outward,  causing the monochromatic nature of the world to start to fade and small hints of colour to reappear.<br />
<br />
“YES!”<br />
The avatar of Slaanesh cried out, its voice orgasmic in it ecstasy, as its formed rippled and collapsed onto the ground, writhing in post orgasmic joy. Its bosoms heaving from gasping breath, its face glowing in flushed smile.<br />
<br />
“My first Gift.”<br />
The seductive voice panted as it pointed towards the remaining cum that was now dripping down the nearby tree.<br />
David&#39;s eyes drawn to the trickling cum slowly , then more rapidly sliding down the grooves in the trees bark before suddenly merging together and then leaping from the base of the tree towards him.<br />
<br />
Landing on his shoulder the small slime suddenly darting down his back into his bag. There was a sudden thumping noise as a  large tome materialised inside David&#39;s bag, before another pop up window appeared before him.<br />
<br />
[Warlock Patron Slaanesh, deity of lust and pleasure.<br />
Special Designation: Chosen of Slaanesh.<br />
Each patron deity may only have one chosen who receives extra benefits from their patron deity.<br />
Benefits accrue over time.<br />
Current benefits, divine blessed familiar & The Tome of Lust invocations<br />
<br />
<br />
Familiar: Semen slime <br />
Approximate size 10mls.<br />
<br />
Slime familiars absorb body fluids offered freely by their assigned players and gain strength based on the type of fluid.<br />
Slimes have advantage on stealth checks when small sized and can traverse through almost any terrain.<br />
Semen slime&#39;s grow significantly faster when fed sexual fluids, and will work to extract sexual fluids from those around them when not fed adequately.]<br />
<br />
The Tome of Lust invocations<br />
This tome teaches warlocks how to infuse lust into their spells, and manipulate their spells for sexual/erotic purposes. While it does not provide all possible options for adult magic, it provides the core basics and additional skill s ranging from intermediate to advanced. Highly sought after by any erotic spell caster.]<br />
<br />
David blinked as suddenly the world returned to normal movement.<br />
The Avatar of Slaanesh suddenly gone without any trace of it being there before.<br />
<br />
“David! Hurry up or we&#39;ll have to camp outside tonight!”<br />
Alex&#39;s voice stirred David from his thoughts as he rushed to meet up with his brother. <br />
His mood drastically improved as they set of further along the forest road.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About one more in game hour later. <br />
Only a couple of miles further down the road from, David and Alex were chatting as they walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, big bro. There&#39;s something else I need to tell you before we meet up with Kevin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. He hates magic users because a lot of the high level spell casters are manipulative dickheads, ruining other players experiences...  and I kinda told him a I hate magic users too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? That doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... He doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m a casting class.&quot; The duo paused, David looking up into Alex&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... You are lying to another player for your safety.&quot;<br />
David nodded, the fear on his face fading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Spell casters are easy targets at low levels, but since I chose the hunter job, I started out in a different tutorial area so I&#39;m not surrounded by all the magic haters. Plus magic users are better at a distance, glass cannons, so ranged weapons are better, and the wizards robes can easily be modified to look like leather armour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t your stats mess with your fighting abilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. Remember you helped me in the home gym the last two years, I even got visible abs. So I actually had pretty good base stats when I got scanned into the game. Pretty good compared to the other players entering at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
David grinned shyly as they started walking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.....&quot; Alex left the word hanging. not sure how to ask his next question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s my plan long term, regarding myself?&quot; <br />
&quot;And you?&quot; David added after a short pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yeah....&quot; Alex felt embarrassed asking, but he didn&#39;t know exactly what he would be doing to help David and for how long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was pondering that over the my tutorial mission and I have reached my conclusion. Part of that was why I sent you that in game message for the Oath of Heroism. You see... You&#39;re a paladin because I asked you to become one, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Alex nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was on the agreement that I would help with your essay writing skills for your English lit class...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I was thinking about what my in game goal was. Ultimately I want to do well at the global championship tournament and win some good prize money, which can be won by individuals OR teams, so I was thinking that you could enter the championship with me and we could split the prize money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex was silent for a long minute. His mind putting the events together.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the championship is in a few months of real time, so how much in game time do we have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically decades, but we will have to take breaks for actual sleep and school. The game will log us both out at 3 in game months, as I set it so we wouldn&#39;t miss dinner. You know mom will be pissed if we don&#39;t eat together.&quot; <br />
<br />
The duo chuckled as they kept walking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey David&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the Oath of heroism, and what do you want me to do for you while we train for the championship. Specifically?&quot;<br />
<br />
David was silent for a few seconds, before stopping and turning towards Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the short term I want you to promise to protect me, both from physical, mental and social harm. That means keeping my magic a secret, even lying directly to peoples faces if need be. In the long term you are to be judged by your actions and your actions are to shield ME, to seek my guidance, to train and build your character the way I see fit, and hone yourself towards the destiny I have planned for you, Alex SteelShield, Paladin of the order.&quot;<br />
<br />
David did his best to keep his voice official and full of authority, knowing the game took Paladins Oaths and their wording very seriously, and taking full advantage that his brother simply had no clue about these things.<br />
<br />
Alex paused for a long moment before nodding reaching his armoured hand out to his brother who took it shaking vigorously before the two men continued walking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this make you my patron?&quot;  Alex asked after a long minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of... In a sense... When I can explain it better I&#39;ll tell you. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
