<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
He hadn&#39;t thought about how he would feel actually walking in to school. <br />
<br />
About the stares. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what the fuck did you DO to yourself, haha!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mark took some old dude&#39;s fatass body for money!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, he looks terrible!&quot; <br />
<br />
Looks of amusement from other boys. Looks of horror and downright disgust from the girls. Teachers looked at him disapprovingly. Some shook their heads. As if to say &quot;What have you DONE?&quot; <br />
<br />
Whispers followed behind him wherever he went. People giggled and laughed at him. People threw crumpled up balls of paper at his head. Finally, lunch came and he tried to find Kurt.<br />
<br />
There was one kid Kurt who had swapped with a 65 year old for a ton of cash. His name was Kurt and he looked like someone&#39;s grandad. Mostly bald with gray hair on the sides, wizened, age spots, the works. He sat with just the other swapped boys, usually. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Can I sit with you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Join the old folks club!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Club, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Jack and Tevon will be here soon. I bet they heard about you. I know I did. I was in homeroom when someone told me I was gonna have company today. Everyone was saying you were gonna talk to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I know that&#39;s lousy. I should have talked with you before now but-&quot; Kurt cut him off with a laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, dude.&quot; It felt weird for a 60 something year old man to call him &quot;dude&quot;. &quot;Lighten up. Look, what are you getting out of being a fatass? What did you make on that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;30 K and a senior management position for my new warehouse job as soon as I graduate.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice! There are laws against trading for promotion, of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No one will say anything. They need the work too badly in this town.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know it&#39;s mainly poor teenagers from low income families that trade? And white teens make the most. You could have held out for more.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark held his head down in shame. &quot;Yeah, well. I&#39;m gonna be making plenty of dough before going to college.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gonna go bald? I could use another bald buddy. Tevon is totally bald. Jack has a full head, the asshole. Hey, speaking of which! Here we are, the old folks crew at Old Creek High!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tevon introduced himself. Before, he had been the athletic star of the school. He had been black. Fully muscled. Big dicked. He had a premium ten inch dick and bodybuilder frame. He looked before like a football hero. Now he looked like he could be a bus driver. Short, white, bald dude with a gut. The folds of skin made a &quot;V&quot; shape in the back of his head. He was only 5&#39;5&quot; now and totally hairless. People called him &quot;Cue ball&quot;. But he was making a cool 200K for just one year as a stocky white middle aged dad type of guy. The guy was an inventor of some medical tech device or something. He was living it up in his mansion fucking hot guys left and right. He was gay and Tevon was straight but that&#39;s because gay dudes loved to pay for swaps way more than straight men. It was considered a very gay male thing to do, especially for middle aged gay men. <br />
<br />
&quot;I swapped with a gay guy, too. So I guess that means i&#39;m gonna be attracted to guys from now on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to it,&quot; Tevon told him. &quot;My mama was so mad she grounded me when she found out. Til I told her I had 200K in the bank. She forgave me after that. What did you make?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;30K&quot; <br />
<br />
They all laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;And a $28/hr job after college for nine months before going off to school.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. You got ripped off, man.&quot; Jack said. Jack was inside the body of a 48 year old, short Asian dude. He was also only 5&#39;5&quot;. He had been 6&#39;3&quot; in his old body. Now he looked pathetically small. But he had extremely red hair, which gave him a higher price. The Asian man he had swapped heads with now had his good looks, his red hair. The transformation lasted between 3 and 4 months most of the time but with Jack it had only been a month and a half. <br />
<br />
&quot;I aged quickly and now I look like I&#39;m Chinese. It&#39;s so weird. But I got 80K and I was happy to get it. Too bad I don&#39;t have a ten inch dick.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well no, you&#39;re Chinese,&quot; said Tevon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Cue Ball.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s it like? I mean, how do people treat you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like you don&#39;t fucking exist. Trust me. We&#39;re the only ones who are gonna give you the time of day from now on,&quot; Kurt told him. Kurt looked like he could be someone&#39;s grandfather. He had age spots and his face was severely wrinkled. He opened up a Lunchables packet. &quot;My Mom warned me about it and I didn&#39;t listen to her. She said I&#39;d be depressed. Hell, I&#39;ve started hanging out at the senior center. None of the kids at school want to invite me over anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tevon said. &quot;You&#39;re pretty much a pariah now. Welcome to Old Folks Club!&quot; <br />
<br />
After school, Mark&#39;s dad picked him up. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you ready for the gym, buddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. They told me I had a pass out of gym class. Coach was furious with me. Kicked me off the team,&quot; Mark said, tearing up. &quot;I mean I expected it but he didn&#39;t have to be so mean about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t listen to that guy. I can help you lose weight. But you have to do like I say. Listen to my instructions. Do NOT eat anything unless your mom and I approve of it. Understand? I wish you&#39;d said something before you did this but you chose it. Now you&#39;re going to have to do something about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Mark said glumly. <br />
<br />
His stomach grumbled and his body was having a nic fit, though he didn&#39;t know what it was yet. He felt sweaty and fidgety, and walking inside the gym was humiliating. Getting dressed was humiliating. Going on the treadmill was going to kill him! He watched with intense and burning jealousy as his dad ran a couple of treadmills down. He had to slow the pace and by the time it was over, he had only worked off a fraction of the calories his dad had. It wasn&#39;t fair! But he shook his head and told himself that it was. He had been the one who had hurriedly agreed to this. <br />
<br />
Lifting weights wasn&#39;t any easier. His bearish frame had some muscle underneath all that fat, but it was buried. He was definitely going to have to fight the impulses of this body and that was going to be harder than he thought. Everything was so hard now! He could barely work with even the ten pound dumbbells! His big hairy belly chafed against his gym shirt. <br />
<br />
In the locker room, he managed to sneak a peek at his dad&#39;s dick. He had never in his life gotten a thrill out of seeing a man&#39;s dick but now he was! And it was his own father! His own straight father! <br />
<br />
His father was packing a nice seven incher. Genetics must have skipped him over for a longer dick, he thought bitterly. Now he had a five incher and he couldn&#39;t wait to get home to jerk off. And smoke a cigar! <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I need to smoke. My body is burning. Ted says his body is used to smoking 3 to 5 cigars a week,&quot; he admitted to his father when they were in the car together. &quot;Would it be okay if I have one when I get home?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really. Well. Don&#39;t tell your mother. Since she&#39;s the one that got me to quit. But at least they&#39;re cigars. Cigarettes I can&#39;t stand the smell but cigars are rather nice. Tell you what. Go down to the park at the end of the street to smoke, okay?&quot; I don&#39;t want her to have to chew you out. I&#39;ll break it to her when you&#39;re gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
When they got home, Mark made a dash for the bathroom. He had been too ashamed to shower at the gym and he was beginning to really reek. His B.O. was off the charts now. He slathered on a bunch of cologne his dad had stowed in the cupboard and forgotten about. Then, he was dressed again and grabbing a cigar he took a walk to the park. <br />
<br />
It was difficult to walk now. He felt like one of the fat people in that movie Wall-E! Being 270 pounds was far less fun than he thought it would be. He had seen people smoking cigars in movies and briefly watched a Youtube tutorial. He got a pen cap and made a hole with it around the end of the cigar. Then he planted it firmly in his mouth and drew from the flame...<br />
<br />
Pure heaven entered his mouth and he moaned. Hints of cedar and some earth tones. Just beautiful, woodsy, heaven. He puffed and puffed. He paused for a moment. It was dusk. He was walking alone on the sidewalk. His big, hefty frame jiggled as he walked. He wondered what he would feel like in a few months when he really looked like a middle aged man. A stranger&#39;s face in the mirror would appear before him. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the thought made him hard. <br />
<br />
He reached the corner park. The streetlights came on. He walked past the restrooms. No one was around. He smoked his cigar some more. It was an amazing sensation. His entire body felt better, more energized and calm. He exhaled. What a day! Only 364 more left to go! <br />
<br />
He thought of all the hot, sweaty bodybuilders in the gym. What must it be like to taste their skin, as the sweat poured off of them in beads? His mouth drooled and he smoked more. Tasting and savoring the cigar and pretending it was a big fat dick in his mouth. He moaned in pleasure. Over the next half hour he smoked on the park bench. He watched the restroom with a furtive eye. There was a man around 30, decent build and looks, who was staring at him and it turned Mark on. Guys were now turning him on. The guy must think he was a fat piece of shit. Maybe he suspected there was a head swap. God that guy was so hot! He felt sick over the idea. He had never had gay thoughts in his life. <br />
<br />
Mark finished his cigar, stubbing it out on the ground. He had just smoked his first cigar and it felt totally awesome! Having to take a leak, he lumbered his way over to the bathroom. It was such a chore to walk anywhere now! His belly jiggled and shook with every step. Inside the stall, he found relief but could barely even see his dick under his gut! Sighing, he zipped up and came out. The other guy was washing his hands. He turned around and eyed Mark appraisingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess. You made some extra money recently with a head swap.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You caught me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You ever smoked a cigar before? I saw you earlier out there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No! That was actually my first time smoking! It was pretty great. I really enjoyed it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you have a dad bod now. I bet you did. Hey. Don&#39;t suppose you would want to help me out? Maybe suck me off? Would you be into that?&quot; The man spoke in a soft, sultry, seductive voice that made Mark want to do whatever he said. Mark shook his head yes. The man was so handsome and cool. He instructed Mark to come into the bigger stall with him. Had him lock the door behind them. Had him kneel. <br />
<br />
The man undid his fly and he was beautiful. A nice, thickly-headed dick, veiny and an impressive 7 inches, just like his dad! Well, it was a little thicker than his dad&#39;s cock. He started sucking it. He didn&#39;t need to be told. It tasted just as good as his cigar had...even better! The cock flesh surrounded his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, yeah. Nothing hotter than a kid sucking my dick with a dad bod. Fuck that&#39;s hot. How old are you, kid?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;17.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No shit? You look younger?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone says that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Get your mouth back on,&quot; the man impatiently instructed him, forcing Mark&#39;s head down, harder and harder. Mark was straining against the pressure of having a dick fill his throat for the first time. He gagged but the man had an iron clamp and the next thing he knew, the man was cumming and spraying down his throat. The man sighed with relief, buckled up and simply left Mark without saying a word. <br />
<br />
Mark was now a cocksucking whore and he loved every minute of it!</p>
