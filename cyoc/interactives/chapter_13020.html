<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I got an idea for a totally awesome transformation trick!” Ty cheered out loud to Allen. The two boys were still laughing at the three teens, who were standing completely naked on the opposite end of the pool!<br />
<br />
“Come on, Ty!” Peter shouted angrily at him, across the pool. “What’s the big idea?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, you guys! I want to try something on the three of you!” Ty said with a huge grin on his face. “I think Ryan will love this. By the way, how tall is Ryan, again?”<br />
<br />
Peter became a little concerned when Ty mentioned his adopted brother Ryan, who was the giant, nine-year-old, twenty-five foot tall, ebony muscle boy.<br />
<br />
“Ryan’s twenty-five feet tall, Ty…” Peter replied, giving him a confused look on his face. “Why? What are you going to do to Ryan?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing! I’m going to do something to the three of you!” Ty said with an evil grin on his face. Ty rolled his eyes as he did the math in his mind, before he glanced back at the three, naked teens.<br />
<br />
“I wish for the three of you to grow, until each one of you is exactly eight-foot, four-inches tall!” he shouted out loud.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the three teens gasped as each one of them grew by a little over two feet! Peter, Tim and Rob noticed how their bodies grew bigger, their arms and legs grew longer, until they were over eight feet tall!<br />
<br />
“Holy cow! I’m huge!” Tim gasped, as he saw the ground drop further from his head.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! I’m growing!” Robert shouted, as he began to wonder what was happening to his body, and why.<br />
<br />
“Ty! What are you doing???” Peter shouted at him, as he felt his body grow by over two feet as well.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, Cousin!” Ty chuckled. “You’ll thank me later!”<br />
<br />
Both Allen and Ty were laughing up a storm, as they savored the moment of staring at three, confused and naked, giant teens. The three guys had no idea what Ty had in store for them.<br />
<br />
“Peter, use your psychic powers and tell your brother to come over to the pool…” Ty ordered Peter. Peter just rolled his eyes and sighed, before he closed them and concentrated on his giant, kid brother.<br />
<br />
“Alright…” Peter responded. “I told him to come. Now, what do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
“I wish for the three of you to fuse together and to form one, giant person with Peter’s head on top of the body!”<br />
<br />
All three teens gasped when Ty made that wish out loud, and immediately the power started working. <br />
<br />
Since Peter was standing in the middle, both Rob and Tim were being pulled in towards him, with their bodies fusing together and reconstructing, so that matching limbs, muscles, cells, veins and all other body parts would be summed up together in order to produce one giant teen body!<br />
<br />
“Oh no… I’m being pulled inside of Peter!” Tim shouted, as his body was pulled towards Peter, fusing together into one.<br />
<br />
“What the… Help! Noooo!” Rob screamed, as his body pulled towards Peter on the other side, disappearing as soon as he touched Peter’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Next, Peter started to grow bigger… His hands, arms and legs grew bigger and thicker! His whole body grew longer and wider, and within a minute Peter tripled in size, until he was exactly twenty-five feet tall!<br />
<br />
“Holy moly! Tim? Rob? Where are you?” the giant Peter said, as he looked around and noticed that he was the only person left standing on his side of the pool.<br />
<br />
“I’m here!” Rob’s voice said, coming from inside of Peter!<br />
<br />
“Hey, this is weird!” Tim’s voice said, also coming from inside of the giant teen.<br />
<br />
Of course, Ty and Allen were reeling with laughter! Allen laughed so hard, that he fell off the lounge chair, and Ty almost felt a pain in his throat from laughing, which angered the giant teen.<br />
<br />
“Let’s splash him!” Tim said, using Peter’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“I say we jump in the pool!” Rob answered.<br />
<br />
“Alright!” Peter shouted. “Being twenty-five feet tall has its advantages… We can make one big splash!”<br />
<br />
“Oh no… NOOOO!” Allen shouted when he heard that. Both Ty and Allen were still wearing their school clothes, and they had not planned on getting wet so soon!<br />
<br />
“I wish me and Allen were wearing…” Ty began to say, when the giant Peter jumped in the pool, splashing down right in front of them!<br />
<br />
“GERONIMOOOO!!!” the giant, naked teen shouted, as his overgrown body came down, plunging into the pool and completely drenching Ty and Allen, before Ty could even finish saying his wish!<br />
<br />
“Haaaahahaha!!!” Ryan laughed, since the giant muscle boy had just witnessed the part where the giant Peter plunged into the pool, completely covering Ty and Allen with a huge wall of water!<br />
<br />
“Peter! This is awesome! You’re a giant, like me!!” Ryan cheered, as he dove into the pool, splashing even more water over Ty and Allen!<br />
<br />
Just as Ryan came up and looked Peter in the eye, he looked down and noticed that the giant Peter wasn’t wearing his Speedo!<br />
<br />
“Hey, what is this?” Ryan said angrily, as he folded his muscular arms in front of his huge pectorals. “You should at least wear your Speedo or your swimming trunks before you go swimming, big brother! Since when do you swim naked?”<br />
<br />
“I was… We WERE wearing our Speedos!” Peter shouted back at Ryan. “Ty made us outgrow them!”<br />
<br />
“No problem!” Ryan grinned. “I’ll fix that! I wish for giant Peter to be wearing a giant Speedo right now!” <br />
<br />
Ryan also had the power to change things, and suddenly the giant Peter was wearing his Speedo!<br />
<br />
When Peter and Ryan turned and saw how Ty and Allen were still laughing at them, even though they were completely drenched while still wearing their school clothes, the two giants decided that it was their turn to have some fun.<br />
<br />
“SPLASH THEM, BRO!” Peter shouted, and both Peter and Ryan used their giant arms to drench Ty and Allen even more!<br />
<br />
“AAARGGG… STOP!!!” Ty screamed back at them. “I’m SOAKING WET ALREADY!!!”<br />
<br />
“Whoohoo this is fun!” Ryan cheered, while looking at Peter, who was now just as big and tall as him. “How did you end up so big? Did you do that yourself?”<br />
<br />
“No! Ty fused Rob and Tim inside of my body and it made me grow to your size!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“Hi Rob! Hi Tim! I’m Peter’s brother Ryan!” Ryan said to Peter! “This is so cool! I want you to stay like this for the rest of the day, so we can play and have some fun!” <br />
<br />
Peter immediately felt Ryan’s power work inside of him, and he rolled his eyes as he chuckled something to himself and the two other guys who shared his body.<br />
<br />
“Well, guys… You won’t have your bodies back until we’re done playing with Ryan…”<br />
<br />
“And now, you two…” Ryan said, as he turned towards Ty and Allen, who were standing by the edge of the pool, while still wearing their clothes, which were soaking wet. <br />
<br />
“I want you to change into wearing just your Speedos and to jump in the pool right now!” Ryan ordered.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Allen shouted, as he felt the effects of Ryan’s powers. His wet clothes completely disappeared!<br />
<br />
Ryan was the most powerful kid there, and immediately Ty and Allen felt their wet clothes disappear, leaving them wearing their own Speedo’s, before they were both forced to dive into the pool.<br />
<br />
The two giants and the two teens continued to have fun, as they swam, played football, played Frisbee, and walked around the park for the remainder of the afternoon.</p>
