<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jacks are notoriously hard to breed.  They typically mount and dismount more than once, to tease the jenny or mare.  That&#39;s bad enough wit a jenny bu with a mare it confuses the heck out of her.  Princess has never been bred before...that could be good in this case.&quot;<br />
&quot;How? Vicky asked the Vet.<br />
Someone came running over with the &#39;expiration&#39; time on Princess.  About an hour and fifteen minutes.<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; Vicky said soft but angry.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s pushing it, really pushing it...&quot; the Vet said.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not even hard, and she already smeared her pussy all over his face...&quot;<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter...necessarily.  He&#39;ll have to get hard eventually but it&#39;s not unusual for a jack to mount flaccid the first time, maybe second time too.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so messed up,&quot; Vicky smirked, &quot;Princess wants a hard one, don&#39;t you girl?&quot;<br />
You whinny, distraught because the jack donkey shows no interest in your availability.<br />
&quot;Does she understand?  Can she tell what you&#39;re saying to her?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...she knows.  Some of them don&#39;t but Princess responds to stuff I say to her.  Why?&quot;<br />
Tell her to pull her mouth, her lips, pull them back...like this...&quot; the Vet made a weird kind of grimace, &quot;and her ears too.  Lay them back against her head, and it isn&#39;t a Flehman...it&#39;s different, she&#39;ll need to make a sort of chewing with her teeth her lips are back...&quot;<br />
&quot;Princess!  Did you hear her?  Princess!&quot; Vicky is addressing you urgently.<br />
You look over at her, you understand but you don&#39;t...the stress is beginning to affect your heat display again...<br />
Vicky speaks slower, coming over and taking your head; she leads you back over to the jack.<br />
&quot;Princess...this is all on you...but don&#39;t stress, you can do this.  I know you can.&quot; Vicky smiles at you, &quot;You&#39;re going to have to MAKE this donkey want you.  There&#39;s still time but none to waste.  You have to be all in, no more pretending you don&#39;t want it...no more being fickle or you may as well just stop now.&quot;  She scolded, &quot;You need to flirt like you&#39;ve never flirted before, but don&#39;t be coy...you&#39;re lucky to have this last chance but he&#39;s not that interested in you so you&#39;ll need to give yourself away here.&quot;  She takes your head and forces it so you are seeing her as she adds, &quot;I know you can do this.  You watched those other mares and you judged them, but now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; She pointed over at the male-fillies who would be bred into mares tomorrow.  &quot;Put on a show for them...&quot; she smiled, then laughed &quot;show them what a how bad you want it...&quot; Vicky kissed your head &quot;Show ME...go get some donkey pizzle Princess; get some!  Good girl...you lil&#39; donky whore!&quot;  Vicky slapped your butt, laughing, sending you off to seduce the jack.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know what you were doing.  Your equine mind was heat maddened and the remnants of your human mind increasingly seemed to be reasserting itself...but under so many new strains and influences it could arguably no longer be called &#39;your&#39; mind.  The heat roiled inside Princess&#39; mind, obsessing over this jack donkey climbing onto and penetrating you in time to secure your future as a mare.  The human wreckage understood what was at stake...the way an addict &#39;understands&#39; sobriety; under a sudden reverential infatuation of Vicky it too was spurred toward copulation with a jack donkey.  Underneath, it was clear that something was not right in all of this, that you were not actually meant to be a mare...but the unexpected bonding with Vicky and impending deadline created a blind urgency to rush toward the most expeditious solution.<br />
<br />
Nervousness and stress stymied the physiological byproducts of donkey lust.  There was some level of pungency, inconsistent vaginal winking and just enough lubrication that some dripping and leakage seeped from your twat.  It was not enough.  The assistant who&#39;d come forward did indeed know something of the breeding of a mare under a jackass.  He ordered a sort of pit to be dug for your hind legs to stand in in order to level up the height difference between you and your hoped for mate.  While this was going on you were a hot mess of flashing, rubbing, urinating, grimacing (with ears flattened) and awkward attempts at fellating a donkey cock.  A good forty five of the remaining seventy five minutes of marehood were spent in this brainless, incomprehensible display of neediness and loose promiscuity.  In short, you couldn&#39;t seduce a donkey.<br />
You had a half hour to interest and execute coitus with an ass.<br />
<br />
Finally, having given up on you Vicky moved to take control of the jackass...she didn&#39;t know it&#39;s name...no one else seemed to either.  Under her direction one of the assistants found some raspberries and cinnamon which she began feeding the jack from her hand.  Moving closer to your sex, you were now tied to keep her neurotic movements from spooking the jack, she teased him with the combined scent of a potential mate and taste of cinnamoned raspberry ultimately smearing your vulva with the fruity mess and forcing raspberries and cinnamon inside it&#39;s folds so that the donkey would root it&#39;s tongue around inside you.<br />
As you began to be more aroused your mate seemed to change.  You seemed to relax some too, as you realized that nothing you did made you attractive to the jackass and simply relied on Vicky to beguile it atop you through some counterfeit means.  You had longed for a virile stallion to struggle and take you but you were resigned now to this unknown donkey using you to bust a nut...and you hoped Vicky could pull that off for you.<br />
The jack mounted, but you could tell by the reaction of the crowd around you that he wasn&#39;t ready to claim you...you kept your eyes on Vicky though and you made an effort to enhance your accessibility.<br />
&#39;So what if I&#39;m acting like a cheap whore&#39; you thought to yourself as you tried to trap the jackass with your oozing snatch...at the same time choking down panic at knowing you only had minutes to get that big dong stuffed into you...and if you still had hands that&#39;s probably what you would be doing right now.<br />
What if you didn&#39;t succeed in being impaled by him??  Would you simply revert to who you were before?  No one seemed to know the answer to that exactly, as it had never happened that anyone could remember.  Only you had failed to secure enough interest from a stallion in all the years the farm had operated.  You begin trumpeting in distress.  You know you shouldn&#39;t but your anxiety and stress break you down.<br />
Your body is beginning to change.  You feel it first in your ears, they feel different...but familiar, from the past.  Your brain seems like it&#39;s clearing from a fog...you know this is not something that you want!  The squealing trumpet erupts again, as if you&#39;re trying to scream &#39;get me out of here&#39;.<br />
Vicky is smiling over at you, seeming to encourage you, inspired you let out another trumpet, and another.  The jackass dismounted from his faux mating mount, the male-to-filly mares are watching; you see their eyes widen...you&#39;re inspiring them with your successful resistance to being fucked into permanent mare-hood.  Pride wells up in you.  You have won, in moments you will be a man.  Vicky is smiling, you wonder if perhaps...<br />
A weight slams onto your back, the male-to-filly mares react in terror and hopelessness.  Vicky&#39;s voice addresses them, taunting them that this will be them tomorrow.  Instead of bucking and kicking you for some reason freeze, legs splayed out wide, dug in on the dirt beneath you...the perfect stance for an easy slide on a well lubricated vagina.  Your arms are no longer covered in fur...you try to kick out with your legs, which look human again, but that only lifts them off the ground allowing the natural thrust motion to glide your donkey superior&#39;s penis into the mare&#39;s vagina that remains between those once again human legs.  You look at Vicky, she sees the terror in your eyes and begins laughing.  You trumpet out &quot;Noooo!&quot; for a split second before it transitions back to the sound of a mare trumpeting her distress.  The crowd begins cheering and clapping.  The Men-to-fillies erupt in terrified anguish as you demonstrate the utter hopelessness of their situation tomorrow.<br />
The jackass mounted on you drives home one or two more thrusts and finishes inside you.  Vicky&#39;s blue eyes dance as she watches you.  You feel something leave forever from you but are unsure what it is.  Your mate has completed you...you know that, his sperms swim inside you with purpose and their goal is now your purpose.  Donkeys are quicker...once they are in, they pull the trigger.  Maybe those other mares weren&#39;t screaming in orgasm...maybe?  Maybe a stallion fucking was no better...it could be normal...not having an orgasm when your mate had one?<br />
It was exactly the question Vicky asked the Vet.  It almost didn&#39;t register the few weeks later when they were talking during your exam - you were pregnant - but donkeys generally did not induce orgasm in their mates...and, as it turned out mares that were successfully bred by asses were uncommon.  Most mares were too refined through breeding to react well toward the jackass trait that required so much effort to induce lust in him.  You however were not highly refined, rather more toward the slutty end of the spectrum...willing to work to get his interest.  More than once in later years you showed no qualms about using your tongue to bring yourself to a disinterested donkey&#39;s attention.  You were quite needy, and that pushed you to try harder than other females.  You had learned from Vicky that your purpose was to serve, and you served and serviced every jack donkey you were paired with.  Because you were in the process of transforming back to human when your initial mating happened you retained a higher level of human mentality than other men-to-fillies or even men-to-stallions...for better or for worse; and you always retained memory of Vicky...oftentimes thinking of her as some jackass dumped his load inside you.</p>
