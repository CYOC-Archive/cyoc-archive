<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan shaped up on Angus, standing before him.<br />
<br />
“Clothes!” Dan ordered.<br />
<br />
Getting the message, Angus took off suspenders, kicked his shoes off and got out of his tight stained khakis. <br />
He was about to toss them to one side when Dan interrupted him.<br />
<br />
“Tear them”. he ordered Angus.<br />
<br />
Angus wasn’t too sure what he heard.<br />
<br />
“Come again, Master? I don’t think I understand.”<br />
<br />
“Your pants. Tear them. Now.” he reiterated.<br />
<br />
With that he held onto his pants with hand on each leg, effortlessly he tore the pants along the crotch<br />
seam, the pants coming in two.<br />
<br />
“As my live in submissive, you will never need pants. Never.”<br />
<br />
Dan presented a monumentally huge, decorated lock from out of his backpack.<br />
<br />
“On your knees, Angus.  At attention!” commanded Dan.<br />
<br />
Without any thought Angus fell to his knees, His back stiff and rigid, his head upright, his arms behind is<br />
back. His low-hanging balls which would otherwise swing around as he walked<br />
resting on, the ground  the last foot of his cock snaking out infront of<br />
him along the ground. Angus waited with open ears at what his Master would say<br />
next. Even on his knees, Dan was looking at Angus at eye level.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I own you, you are completely mine. Forever. This lock is unlocked by the same key that belongs to the lock I<br />
have adorned around your neck. Let this always serve as a reminder of my power<br />
and control over aspect every part of yourself: your mind, your body, your<br />
soul, your identity – anything that was once yours is mine . What used to be<br />
you is gone forever.  Something much better has taken its place”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Droplets of tears were dripping from Angus’s eyes. These words sounded so beautiful to Angus, words that spoke<br />
to the very core of him, words that he had always wanted, always needed to hear<br />
but he hadn’t known until that very moment. Angus had been so moved that his<br />
cock rose instantly to attention, precum slowly bubbling out the end and<br />
pooling along the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dan looked down at his newest pup. He was so eager to please, so excitable. There was innocence to Angus<br />
which Dan found instantly endearing. All of this was new to him and he had a<br />
lot to take in at once.  Unlike Patrick and Magnus, who were born into a<br />
clan of gingers who embody the highest pedigree of servitude, all this was<br />
unfamiliar to Angus. His limited knowledge of service gained only the romance<br />
books he's read. What Angus lacked in experience he made up for sheer enthusiasm.<br />
Dan loved it but be he’s too green – Dan thought.<br />
<br />
“Angus, you are a journey of becoming. As your Master I am very proud of your enthusiasm, but you have a lot <br />
of to learn, before you ascend to be my perfect pup. I have a few questions to ask.”<br />
<br />
Dan shifted the big lock from hand to hand. “Do you want to be my perfect pup?” Dan asked the vulnerable <br />
goliath before him.<br />
<br />
“More than anything in the world, Master!”. Angus barked back at Dan, an urgency and sincerity dripping<br />
from his every word.<br />
<br />
“Do I have your absolute loyalty?” further pressed Dan.<br />
<br />
“Absolute is not strong enough a word. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for my Master.”<br />
<br />
Dan moved closer to Angus and looked directly into his eyes. They were big, green and still wet with tears.<br />
<br />
“Do you understand that loyalty means doing things that will be uncomfortable, doing things you don’t like, <br />
and even then thanking your Master for every order that you get and wishing for more?”<br />
<br />
“One hundred percent, Master!” Angus responded, feeling a little uneasy about where Dan was taking his line of<br />
questioning. He did his best to try to conceal his feelings desperate to prove he was worthy of the <br />
prestigious honour he had been given.<br />
<br />
“Good” Dan merely said as he momentarily put down the lock and reached into his back pack and lifted out a<br />
shiny cock cage he had especially ordered to be made up for Angus. Dan was<br />
quite proud of it, most cages in this world were made of cheap aluminium – more<br />
than enough for a regular person but not for a ginger as young, virile and<br />
recently collared like Angus. This special one was made of cast iron –  so<br />
strong not even the most powerful ginger erections could not bend it out of<br />
shape. It was made to Angus’ exact specifications (with measurements provided<br />
by the Chronovac.). Welded onto the front of the cage was a plate engraved with<br />
the same “Property of Master Dan” shield as Angus bared on his rump. From<br />
either front or behind there was now no mistaking who this pup belonged to.<br />
<br />
Angus looked upon the cock cage<br />
before with fearful eyes unlike any Dan had ever seen. It pained Dan to do<br />
this, but as his Master he knew it was what was best to do for the latest<br />
addition to his growing family. Dan knew that true satisfaction would come by<br />
carefully moulding him, not with the Chronovac, but with his own command.<br />
<br />
“Angus, please know what I am<br />
about to do I am doing because I love you... but you need to learn discipline<br />
and self control. You need it”<br />
<br />
Dan dropped the cock cage before Angus.<br />
<br />
“Now stand up and put it on.” Demanded Dan.<br />
<br />
Angus stood up and lifted the cock cage, the first piece of the cock cage, a hinged doughnut, wrapped around<br />
his enormous cock and balls, the cast iron of the cage was thick and heavy.<br />
Angus felt the weight pull down on his crotch, but it was the second piece, a<br />
curved cylindrical tube with which Angus was to sheathe his cock with, which<br />
made him really feel the weight.  With almost blind fervour, such keenness<br />
to follow his Master’s direct order he took to the monumental task of feeding<br />
foot after foot of his own cock down into the end of the cage. After a great<br />
effort struggle to get it in, relief overcame Angus as the receiving end met<br />
with the base. Dan sealed the cage together with the lock once at the base and again at the end of his device <br />
by feeding the lock to unite his new Prince Albert to the metal bars of the cage.<br />
It would be impossible for Angus to get if off with his own hand. <br />
<br />
It was so tight and constraining the effect was not unlike a ham wrapped in twine.<br />
<br />
Dan was not done. Not yet.<br />
<br />
He reached further into his bag. Pulling out another hinged doughnut,<br />
this one with a smaller diameter to the first but at least four times thicker.<br />
It looked impossibly heavy, or at least in his old life Dan couldn’t have<br />
dreamed about lifting something this heavy. Dan selected it because it weighed<br />
220 pounds, a fitting starting weight.  Dan kneeled down and fitted the<br />
massive stretcher above his balls and locked it shut with another lock. It<br />
weighed Angus’s balls down extremely taught and heavily, like a pendulum<br />
dangling three quarters down his massive muscled legs. Angus’s cock struggled<br />
in its cage, the iron frame providing no give. It was an unstoppable object<br />
meeting an immovable force,<br />
<br />
<br />
A slight tell in Angus’ face told Dan he was uncomfortable with the new weight. However, Angus remained<br />
strong faced and at attention. Dan was proud of his pup for being strong. He<br />
looked at his pup in square in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“I know this makes you uncomfortable, but you will learn to crave it, it brings your close to your Master. One <br />
of the things your Master loves about you the most his pup is his low hanging balls. I<br />
want to stretch them out as much as I can. Eventually they will be stretched so<br />
far that they will drag several feet behind you, anchoring you to the ground<br />
with the weight your own cum. You will find it incredibly awquard to leave the<br />
house. Not that you will ever want to. You are my house-pup, my house is your<br />
world, everything beyond it scares you, it has nothing to offer you that you<br />
don’t already have in your Master. Do you understand?”. Dan asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Angus nodded feverishly. There was both intensity and vulnerability in Angus’s eyes; Dan found it<br />
irresistible. It didn’t seem possible but he did truly love him and wanted to<br />
see him grow to his potential.<br />
<br />
<br />
“At attention, Angus!” Dan reminded.  Patrick jutted his back straight, and stuck  his<br />
chest out – making them seem even larger than Dan recalled. He looked upon his<br />
newest pup, appreciating his work.<br />
<br />
Angus would have to find a new centre of gravity to compensate for the massive weight hanging from his crotch.<br />
He will have to be hyper conscious about how he sleeps, how he walks, how he<br />
sits down, how close he will be able to get to objects and other people,<br />
knocking things over with his cage. Closing his legs is completely out of the<br />
question. With their new weight hanging from his balls he will never be able to<br />
run again or build up momentum without causing himself massive amounts of pain,<br />
not that he’ll never need to anyway.  Angus was going to be big and<br />
docile, just how Dan liked it.<br />
<br />
“Here are your orders Angus. Your sexuality belongs to me. Number one, you are not to touch yourself for<br />
pleasure unless you get explicit permission from me. That includes your<br />
nipples. Your pleasure will come from your service to me. Second, you are not<br />
to get any erections nor are you allowed to cum unless you are given explicit<br />
permission from your Master. I realise this will be agonising for you as a ginger.<br />
Your balls will almost grow full to the point of bursting, they will ache and<br />
churn, your need to cum will be unimaginable. Still you must remain disciplined<br />
and focus only on your Master.”<br />
<br />
Dan looked between the ginger’s legs, his balls obviously ripe for relief. The small part of Dan that pitied<br />
Angus was far overtaken by the intoxication over his power over his bull pup.<br />
Beads of sweat were starting to emerge over Angus, but he remained at<br />
attention, his face fixed. He was such a good pup.<br />
<br />
“Order number three. You are to never ask for affection, you may never ask to cum. Both of these are <br />
privileges and are never to be expected. Your Master will award these to you when you have<br />
made your Master proud and have earned them”.<br />
<br />
Dan continued “I realise that<br />
this will be extremely difficult for you, perhaps the hardest thing you’ve ever<br />
done in your life. Only when you learn to overcome your biological urges and<br />
focus entirely and exclusively on your Master will you then know the true joy<br />
of servitude under me. You will learn to cum on my command, the slightest touch<br />
or attention will be explosively pleasurable to you. You will live for these<br />
moments. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
Angus nodded. “Absolutely my Master! Master’s wish is pup’s law.”. There was still a slight nervous behind<br />
his enthusiasm, he has only had his cage on for a few minutes and already he<br />
was feeling the pressure.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think you fully understand Angus. But you will, that’s MY duty to you. Marcus should be just about <br />
done. Now go out and join your brothers and await your next set of orders”<br />
<br />
Like a new fawn, Angus took his first few apprehensive steps feeling the full weight of his Masters new gear,<br />
even small steps making his literally pendulous balls swing back and forth<br />
wildly. Angus would slowly gain more confidence in his step with more practice,<br />
but never fully regaining his composure in his stride. In the meantime he took<br />
very careful steps to rejoin Patrick and Marcus.<br />
<br />
All three of Dan's submissives were branded with his mark, but this was only the beginning of what he had in <br />
mind for them.</p>
