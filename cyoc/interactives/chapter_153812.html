Next Alex got to pick a class skills and a occupational skill, and again he went by David’s instructions, selecting the two skills he had been told to.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Alex SteelShield arrived at the barracks, ready for his assignment. Previously he had only been allowed to follow other guard and paladins on their rounds, observing with the other initiates, yet the time had come for him to be tested, and see if he could earn the rank of acolyte with the paladin order.<br />
<br />
Paladin Treydevos greeted Alex as he approached, the large man’s features completely hidden by the large helmet on his head. Yet strangely his voice range out clearly as he relayed Alex’s orders to him.<br />
<br />
To proceed within the order and be allowed out of the city, Alex would need to gain a reputation for helping people within the city. Specifically, Alex would need to gain 30 reputation points around town. With different people in town worth different numbers of points.<br />
<br />
Alex stood outside the guards barracks scratching his head, as David had not played the town guard himself, and could not provide any advice on the tutorial, other then telling Alex to ask around the markets, taverns, temples or approach anyone who appeared in need of help.<br />
<br />
Entering the main market square, Alex noticed the Baker and his wife arguing through the shop window. Investigating further, the bakery basement had been infested by a small pack of giant rats, and the Baker was too cheap to pay an exterminator to remove them.<br />
<br />
Alex offered to clear the basement, pausing briefly as he thought about how a Paladin should act based on what his brother had said.<br />
“Paladins help others at the expense of themselves. Fighting for truth and justice. Striking down evil. Paladins are at heart selfless...”<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head, realizing the baker and his wife were staring at him frozen, awaiting his next response about whether he would negotiate for a reward. <br />
<br />
Noticing a speech challenge, Alex flashed his best grin as he though it through, deciding to apply his charisma to it.<br />
<br />
(Challenge easy 5, Rolled 10 + CHA bonus of3)<br />
“A Paladin shouldn’t ever EXPECT a reward for their service, however if WORD of my service were to reach the guardhouse I would be in YOUR debt my good sir.”<br />
<br />
“Why thank you Sir knight. If you rid us of these vermin I will make sure the head of the guards hears of my gratitude.”<br />
<br />
Nodding humbly Alex made his way into the base, drawing his word he slew the 6 giant rats within, suffering a small scratch to his arm, but on emerging from the basement, was gifted a small healing potion which he drank straight away, and also a fresh cream pastry.<br />
<br />
“Surely I must have gotten some reputation points from that.”<br />
Alex thought to himself as he reviewed his character sheet.<br />
<br />
Exp 48/300<br />
Reputation Points 3/30<br />
<br />
“Only three reputation points. That means I got one per person and a bonus one for the speech check. DAMN! This might take a while.”<br />
<br />
Alex ate the cream pastry before continuing on with his patrol, keeping his eyes open for any potential chance to help the public, and over the course of the day had helped rescue a cat from a tree for a young girl, helped repair an elderly women’s door after a break in, and stopped a pickpocket inside a fancy clothing store.The owner of the store forcing a small pouch of coins into your hand as you left, before disappearing rapidly into the back rooms before you could decline it.<br />
<br />
Exp 85/300<br />
Reputation Points 9/30<br />
Gold: 61<br />
<br />
“Wow, the clothing store gave me four points, so obviously helping the wealthy or well connected helps my reputation more.”<br />
<br />
The sun was just starting to set when a shrill scream caught Alex’s attention. Turning his head he could see thick black smoke starting to billow out of an open window down a side alley.<br />
<br />
Rushing down the street, a small elderly women and a young boy were huddled out the front of the building. Their cries made it clear there was a young baby still inside.<br />
<br />
As Alex decided what to do, he noticed a timer starting to tick down from 30 seconds. The short timer caught him off guard as he stood paralyzed for a few moments, before noticing the bystanders forming a line from the well, passing buckets of the freezing cold water forward to try and stifle the flames.<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly, Alex grabbed a bucket from one the end of the line, and poured it over himself, before grabbing the next bucket and charging inside.<br />
<br />
Barreling through the doorway, past a the combined lounge and kitchen area that was engulfed in flames, Alex followed the faint crying noise straight up the stairs and into the smoke filled room. <br />
The crib was barely visible, and the heat traveling from the lower floor was almost unbearable.<br />
Reaching the crib, Alex picked up the baby, bud found the flames were now blocking the stairwell.<br />
<br />
Another timer started counting down, this time from 15 seconds.<br />
Alex could charge through or maybe there was another way.<br />
Looking down at the child, Alex decided to find another way, as he could manage charging through the flames, but the child would get horribly burnt if it survived. <br />
<br />
Running to the window Alex looked around and saw the clothes line leading across the street. Drawing his sword he quickly cut one of the two ropes, and after pouring the second bucket on himself, tied the bucket handle to the rope, placed the child inside and slowly lowered it down tot he street.<br />
<br />
Charging through the smoke and flames, Alex dropped to his knees, coughing furiously as he struggled to remain upright. Several of the bystanders cheering as the old women clutched the small baby tight against her.<br />
(Constitution DC 10, Rolled 9 + CON bonus 5 =14)<br />
<br />
Struggling to his feet, Alex assisted with putting out the flames, his body dripping with sweat within his heavy armor as he poured bucket after bucket of cold water into the house, stopping the flames before they could spread to any neighboring buildings.<br />
<br />
As the smoke settle Alex finally collapsed against the edge of the well, using his hands to cup the water, he drank deeply to quench his thirst and cool his glistening body, broiling away under the heavy steel plate.<br />
 <br />
“Damn, this game feels too realistic, I swear I could feel the flames licking against my flesh, and that I’m stuck in a Sauna right now.”<br />
<br />
Alex mused as other town guardsmen finally arrived and were updated by the other bystanders.<br />
<br />
“Very good work saving the child Initiate SteelShield, and you acted quickly enough to stop the flames spreading to the other houses. I will make sure Paladin Treydevos hears of this.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, thank you for saving my granddaughter brave knight. Her mother passed away this morn during child birth, and in my grief I didn’t pay enough attention to the fire in the hearth. I have nothing to repay you with, but I will name the child Alexandra after the man who saved her.”<br />
<br />
The elderly women spoke with passion, tears glistening in her eyes as one of her neighbors led her away, offering to take her and the child in for the time being.<br />
<br />
Alex reviewed his stats.<br />
Exp 144/300<br />
Reputation Points 24/30<br />
Gold: 61<br />
<br />
“Almost there, but something about this feels unfinished.”<br />
<br />
Almost as if on cue a quest alert popped up for Alex to check on the elderly women the next day. <br />
Making a mental note of which house she went into, Alex stumbled backwards as a large white column of light started glowing above the house.<br />
Realizing no-one else could see it, Alex realized it was just part of the game mechanics and turned to walk away.<br />
<br />
Yet before he had even made it ten steps, he was approached by a scared looking man in a light brown robe with strands of stray and leaves stuck along the bottom edge.<br />
<br />
“Um, E-Excuse me sir knight. I- I’m sorry to bother you, but I- I saw what you did and I thought you might be hurt... from the flames, and- and I was wondering If- if you would like to use the local bathhouse to clean up?”<br />
<br />
As Alex furrowed his brows in confusion, the young man stepped forward and handed him a hexagonal bronze token.<br />
<br />
“Th-this will grant you one free entry into-into the local bathhouse and also a free pot-potion. I’m sorry for being so wierd!” <br />
The young man blurted the final sentence before turning tails and running.<br />
<br />
Turning the coin over in his hand, Alex decided to wander in the bathhouses direction, not coming across any specific further chances to raise his reputation on the way.<br />
<br />
As he stood outside the white marble building, Alex was unsure whether to enter of not. The nervous young man had seemed so weird about everything. <br />
(Wis DC 10, rolled 4 + -2 Wis modifier =2)<br />
But many people were nervous approaching the town guards, so Alex shook his suspicion off and climbed the large stone steps to the entrance.</p>
