<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Throughout the day, Ethan was acting a bit more nervous. He was clearly uncomfortable with the fact that I was about to find out that he was a werewolf. But what he didn&#39;t know is that I already knew. Every time he&#39;d get a bit testy or angry over nothing, he&#39;d instantly apologize and I would tell him it was alright. He&#39;d calm down a little bit but his leg just wouldn&#39;t stop shaking and he always seemed to have to be gripping something. Luckily it was something that could survive his incredible strength, but watching his bicep flex as he squeezed with a lot of might sure was something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; Ethan breathed. The sun was starting to go down and darkness was overtaking the campus. &quot;Let&#39;s go hang out in the woods...&quot;<br />
<br />
I smirked, leaning up against him. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like a very werewolf place to be,&quot; I mocked. &quot;You know. Cause you&#39;re not a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan shook his head. A deep rumble of a growl vibrated in his throat. &quot;You know you don&#39;t have to go if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; he was trying to back out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. Afterall you&#39;re not a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
The low growl continued as he led me into the forest on the backside of the campus. It wasn&#39;t huge, but it was enough to have a small hiking trail and student could see some foxes or weasels running around if they were really lucky. Otherwise, it was just used by some of the ecology students to study in a more natural environment. The park was meant to be closed after dark, but the only time security ever went over there was if it was reported. And that was only when the frat guys got too much into their hazing and were causing problems.<br />
<br />
With all the trees and foliage, darkness quickly surrounded us. Ethan continued walking deeper and deeper into the forest, then took a left off the trail. &quot;This way,&quot; he said, moving a couple of branches out of the way. I went through and waited for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still not a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued to shake his head as he walked ahead of me. There was a large rock next to a tree that he sat down on and he kicked off his shoes and pulled off his socks. &quot;Don&#39;t be weird about it ok?&quot; Ethan glared at me. I nodded. He removed his shirt and tossed it to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; I muttered as I looked over his massively toned body. He looked up at me and I quickly added a, &#39;Sorry.&#39; But that hundred pounds of added muscle really did a number on him. Thick pecs ushed far out of his chest. And even more surprising were the solid abs underneath them. Even without Ethan flexing, I could see each one perfectly. A forest of black hair covered his chest and abs, only making the man look more primal. Or maybe it was just the light of the full moon reflecting off his body that was doing that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Ethan said. His voice had even more grit that usual. &quot;You wanted to know if I was a werewolf. Here&#39;s your answer.&quot; A loud cracking sound came from his direction. It almost sounded like a bone breaking. He let out a heavy grunt as his back spasmed. Every muscle on his body started to flex. All the way down to his fingertips, they strained themselves. His nails turned dark. Then grew longer out of his fingertips. They quickly sharpened into claws. Claws that could easily tear into a tree of any kind of flesh.<br />
<br />
His hands looked like they doubled in size. Paw pads formed on the palm of his hands while black fur ran up the back. The forest of hair only grew denser and darker as it covered up any of his skin. It ran all the way up his biceps and over his shoulders. Blood was pumping through him at an alarming rate. Wherever the fur touched, his muscles only grew. Already being bigger than you&#39;re average guy, Ethan just started to grow bigger, resembling more the size of a bear than a human. His back stretched, growing longer as it did so.<br />
<br />
Ethan fell forward into the dirt. A deep primal growl rolled out of his throat as his claws dug into the forest floor. He shook his hips as more and more fur ran down his back side. His tail bone pushed further out of his backside. Just a little at first then long enough to be a massive tail. Long stands of fur quickly grew out of the added appendage. All the while his feet were completely reshaping into paws. The bones in his toes quickly reshaped themselves, growing taller and wider to help support his new weight. With each pump of blood they only grew bigger and bigger. More animalistic like claws grew out of where his nails had been. But when Ethan tried to stand back up, his foot lengthened to where his weight was pressed only on the front of his foot instead of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Once he saw the moon, he reeled his head back and let out a howl. His nose quickly turned black and extended out of his face into a long snout. Massive fangs and sharp teeth filled his mouth. The towering posture he had only grew even more as he stood at least a foot and a half taller than he had. Somehow he looked to almost have doubled his weight as he dropped back down onto all fours. The sharp nails dug into the dirt. His attention turned towards me, snarling. Slowly inching closer and closer as his deep threatening growl exited his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHMYGOD! YOU&#39;RE SO CUTE!&quot; I squealed. My arms opened wide as I pulled him into a hug. I knew it was all postering. Even more so when his arms went limp and his tail started to wag. He fell into the hug as I pet his back. His tail started to wag a bit faster as his growl lowered to almost nothing.</p>
