<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a couple hours by the pool and swimming you and Stacy head back to your cabin to change. While you were in the bathroom a weird feeling passed through you and you shuddered. Suddenly Stacy came barging in with nothing but panties on and said, &quot;You have to come see this.&quot; She then dragged you out despite your protests that you only had briefs on.<br />
<br />
Stacy pointed out the porthole and your eyes went wide as you asked, &quot;What the hell?&quot; What you saw was a pink fog outside that shifted colors as you watched going from pink to green to blue to silver to yellow. The fog was changing to all the known colors and some that you didn't have a name for.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know but it's beautiful,&quot; Stacy said in an almost breathless voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get dressed then we'll go out on deck so we can see it better,&quot; you suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a great idea,&quot; Stay enthused.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later you and Stacy were dressed and on the deck staring at the weird fog. You noticed a few other passengers staring at it too but the vast majority seemed to be in their cabins perhaps terrified at this development. &quot;Ever seen anything like this?&quot; a guy asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never in my life,&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;This kind of fog isn't natural,&quot; the guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we are in The Bermuda Triangle,&quot; Stacy said with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never believed the stories of ships and planes just disappearing in The Triangle,&quot; the guy said. &quot;I just thought they were stories drunken sailors told each other. Now seeing this fog I think I'm ready to believe those stories. I'm Danny Poore by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You introduce yourself and Stacy then said, &quot;I didn't think we'd see anything unusual on this cruise but I was wrong. Now I'm hoping that we're not trapped in The Triangle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we'll know for sure until we get out,&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look over there,&quot; Stacy said pointing out several shapes in the fog.<br />
<br />
As you watched the shapes gradually revealed themselves to be a collection of ships and planes tied together. &quot;Some of those ships look really old,&quot; Danny said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of them are,&quot; Captain Mitchell said coming up. &quot;We established radio contact and from what we've been told some of the people have been here for five hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five hundred years?&quot; you asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what they say,&quot; Captain Mitchell said. &quot;They didn't explain how they have stayed alive for that long but given this strange fog I'm inclined to believe them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To think they've been here all this time,&quot; Danny said wonder in his voice. &quot;But if they've been trapped here this long it doesn't look too good for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They've adjusted to life here from what we can gather,&quot; Captain Mitchell said. &quot;In fact they seem to be in high spirits. A few are coming aboard to talk with us. Since you're all obviously curious and brave to be out here I'd like you to join me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounded like a good idea and soon the ship was alongside all the others and five people came up the stairs. One of them stepped forward and said, “My name is Captain Joseph Stone and I am pleased to meet you.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Captain Michael Mitchell and it's a pleasure to meet you too,&quot; Captain Mitchell said then he introduced everyone else.<br />
<br />
After Captain Stone introduced the four people with him he said, &quot;This is a magnificent ship. How many people are on board?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have five thousand passengers and crew,&quot; Captain Mitchell said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the most I've heard about finding their way here,&quot; Captain Stone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren't looking for this place,&quot; Captain Mitchell said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one looks for this place but they find it just the same,&quot; Captain Stone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm curious about something,&quot; Danny said. &quot;How have some of you survived for five hundred years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we don't age normally here,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;We never run out of food no matter how much we eat so we don't starve. Same with water or other drink. We can die from an accident or murder and suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Danny said nodding. &quot;It must get pretty boring after so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be if it weren't for the transformations,&quot; Captain Stone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this place transforms us,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;Sometimes it's just small changes and other times it's big changes. I've seen people become the opposite sex, animals, and even objects. The ones that become objects do eventually transform into something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're making that up,&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see once the transformations start for you,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;Your clothes won't transform though so you might have to borrow from other people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the ship transform?&quot; a lady named Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was an object before coming into this place then it will remain an object,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;Those items remain static not changing no matter what you do to them. I'll show you.&quot; He took out a knife and ripped his shirt with it. In a matter of seconds his shirt seemed to mend itself and it looked like he hadn't ripped it. &quot;You need to be very careful that you don't kill any animal as it might be one of you,&quot; he cautioned. &quot;Though with those that have turned into an object or food you don't have to worry about it. The same force that restores objects and food work on someone who has been transformed into an object or food. Though I can tell you from first hand experience that being eaten isn't pleasant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were eaten?&quot; Stacy asked with her eyes wide and mouth hanging open.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was transformed into a roll and Daryl ate me,&quot; Captain Stone said shrugging. &quot;It's not something I'd care to repeat but I know that it might happen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what triggers a transformation?&quot; Captain Mitchell asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There doesn't seem to be anything that triggers it,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;Sometimes it seems like a person's thoughts trigger it and other times it just occurs without anything seeming to trigger it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do the transformations last?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it varies,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;It also depends on what you mean by how long they last. If you mean how long it takes for a transformation to be complete it can be anywhere from near instantaneous to taking a week. If you mean how long you stay in one form before being changed into another it can be anywhere from minutes to years. We have one mermaid that's been the same for the last one hundred years. She hasn't changed one bit that we've been able to tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any mental transformations?&quot; Danny asked with a grin on his face. You thought he had some fantasies that involved transformation and was looking forward to maybe experiencing some of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we've seen,&quot; Captain Stone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you have all the ships and planes tied together?&quot; Captain Mitchell asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's for protection,&quot; Captain Stone said. &quot;There are pirates that prowl these waters and will attack a lone ship and kill it's crew and passengers. They will attack us at times when they haven't been able to attack another ship in awhile but we're able to repel them before they can board our floating city. With the size of your ship though they may not attack you if you're alone but I won't make any guarantees. We'd be happy to have you join our floating city if you wish.&quot;</p>
