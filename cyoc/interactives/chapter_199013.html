<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arthur awoke feeling a little hung over but mostly great. He looked down and saw a big hairy chest that was somehow his own. That’s right, he had swapped into his uncle yesterday, he remembered.<br />
<br />
His boyfriend Drew was sleeping next to him. He couldn’t believe that his boyfriend ended up in his dad’s body. He lifted their comforter to have another look at his dad’s penis. He really let his dad’s cock penetrate him last night in front of everybody. Thinking about it put a tingle in Arthur’s new man hole.<br />
<br />
Arthur stood up and went to the bedroom mirror to examine his new body. His face lit up into the pervy smile that uncle Frank was known for. He took some nudes on his cellphone and even turned his ass towards the mirror, bent over, and spread his cheeks to get some pics of his uncle’s hairy pink hole.<br />
<br />
He decided to take a quick shower but didn’t want to forget the experience. He set up his phone to record and left the shower door open so that his new body was in full camera view. He had a lot of fun washing his uncle’s big muscle bod, soaping up his furry tits, his somewhat small manhood, and his big hairy ass. He put a couple large soapy fingers up his new hole, and moaned experimentally. He found that uncle Franks’ voice went pretty high and feminine for such a big guy.<br />
<br />
Arthur didn’t wanna make himself cum yet today, so he stopped fingering himself and finished washing up. Drew was still sleeping so Arthur threw on some sweatpants and tshirt and went down to the resort’s gift shop.<br />
<br />
The gift shop was being run by someone in the body of Arthur’s 20 year old cousin. Whoever was piloting that body was clearly looking at their new penis, swaying it back and forth as they held the waistbands of their pants and underwear away for their viewing pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey Arthur,” greeted the boy, hurriedly putting his waistbands back on his waist, “Sorry I didn’t see you there. I’m Grant, I’m going out with your aunt May. I ended up in her son Ryan’s body for the week. The kid’s got a crazy sex drive. I saw your performance with your boyfriend last night. Poor Ryan was so embarrassed that I was jacking off in his body while watching you guys haha.”<br />
<br />
“You’re gay but you’re going out with my aunt?” Arthur asked.<br />
<br />
“No man I’m bi. Don’t tell your aunt but being in her son’s body is so kinky. I don’t know why I’m telling you this, I guess because you showed your kink publicly last night,” said Grant.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry, I shouldn’t’ve assumed,” apologized Arthur.<br />
<br />
“No biggie man. I own you big time anyway. That was the best orgasm of my life jerking off to you and your man having sex in those dad bodies,” said Grant, “Tell you what, I’ll give you all the items you wanted from here on me.”<br />
<br />
“Wow that’s so generous. Well I wanted a nylon rainbow thong to show off my new body here and two custom dildo kits please,” said Arthur, feeling flattered and frankly turned on, pun intended.<br />
<br />
“Coming right up,” said Grant, “But can you change in front of me?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing cutie,” said Arthur, feeling like a dilf in his uncle’s body. He shucked his tshirt and sweatpants and then aside from his socks he was in his birthday suit. Grant was watching with a hand down his pants stroking his girlfriend’s son’s dick.<br />
<br />
Arthur slowly put on the thong, giving Grant a nice show. Once it was on he turned around and did a squat to show off his ass and then turned around again saying, “Alright now I wanna see Ryan’s dick before I go back to my boyfriend’s room.”<br />
<br />
Grant happily repaid the favor by pulling down his pants and underwear, showing off Ryan’s four inch flaccid that was quickly becoming hard.<br />
<br />
“Nice dick. Thanks man, and thanks for the free gifts, I’ll see you around,” said Arthur with a wink. He walked back to his room with both dildo kits and his shirt and pants in his hands. He wanted to show off his uncle’s body to whoever he happened to pass by. A few people saw him and his ass and junk bounced around proudly as he strut by and waved to them.<br />
<br />
When Arthur got back to his and Drew’s room, the phone rang. “Who would be calling at 8am?” Wondered Arthur. <br />
<br />
“Hi, Arthur? Yeah this is Grant from the front desk and gift shop. This is kind of embarrassing but your uncle Frank just made a formal request to leave early and collect his body. To do that he would need the consent of you and the woman he swapped into. I hate to ask, but I have to on his account, will you agree to return his body to him early?” Asked Grant, apologetically.<br />
<br />
“No thank you, and don’t worry that you had to ask me, I’ve had to run the front desk before too, I know you’re just doing your job,” said Arthur.<br />
<br />
“Oh thanks for being cool, and what should I say is your reason for refusal?” Asked Grant.<br />
<br />
Arthur knew that regardless of the reason, any non consensual party meant that an early swap back was a no-go, so he decided to go the route of further pissing uncle Frank off by telling Grant,  “Tell him I haven’t made his body take enough of his older brother’s loads yet. And that I need to make sure the rest of our male relatives get a shot at his man pussy.”<br />
<br />
“You got it,” said Grant cheerfully. They both hung up.</p>
