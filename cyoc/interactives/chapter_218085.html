<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex watched the two wolves from the bushes as they unknotted from their mating. The larger, black furred wolf on top had remained tied to the grey wolf beneath him, until this moment finally pulling himself free. Alex crouched down low, keeping his eyes on the scene in front of him. The grey lapped at the muzzle of the black wolf and trotted off, luckily away from Alex. The black wolf settled in to clan himself, licking his still somewhat hard shaft, then paused and sniffed at the air.<br />
<br />
Blue eyes focused in Alex&#39;s direction, then he turned around and presented himself to Alex, tail wagging, head turned back to keep his attention on the bushes. The sight made his already hard member leap in excitement, and instead of heading off as he had last time he stepped out of the bushes. He wasn&#39;t on two legs anymore, this time he walked on four, grass and fallen leaves soft under his paws as he stepped forward.<br />
<br />
Black growled playfully at him, wiggling his rear a bit more. Alex didn&#39;t need any more invitation, with a growl of his own he mounted the wolf, his cock eagerly thrusting home beneath the other wolf&#39;s tail. He opened his muzzle and took Black&#39;s scruff in his mouth to hold him still as he eagerly began to thrust in and out, his building knot pushing tight against the hole before he pulled back for another thrust. It was unlike anything Alex had experience before, not that he had been with many men before, but this was primal. Finally, he thrust himself completely into Black, his knot pushing into him and tying them together as they both came, twin howls echoing through the woods.<br />
<br />
Alex snapped awake at the hand on his shoulder. Flint was looking down at him with a bit of worry. &quot;Bad dreams? You&#39;re sweating something awful.&quot; Alex reached up and wiped his forehead, his fingers coming back damp, then just shook his head. He had almost worried his hand would be a paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so..&quot; He murmured as he sat up, and this time the innkeeper&#39;s son didn&#39;t stop him, instead walking to the room&#39;s table and setting down a tray that wafted the aromas of breakfast into the room, mingling with the spicy scent that always seemed to accompany Flint. He had shaved this morning, Alex noted with some annoyance, he thought last night&#39;s scruff suited the other man much more, then looked away quickly less he be caught staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;The healer will be by to check on you in a few hours.&quot; Flint stated as he turned to face Alex. He was wearing a pair of baggy trousers tucked into a pair of boots. Instead of the unlaced shirt from yesterday though he was wearing a simple vest, exposing his well muscled arms and open in front showing a line of dark hair from the waistband of his pants up to between his pecs, where it fanned out across his chest. At least he still had some good fuzz without the face scruff.<br />
<br />
Alex turned to slide out of the bed, putting his feet on the ground and standing up, only then remembering he wasn&#39;t in his usual sleepwear, instead being completely naked. He quickly sat back down and grabbed a blanket to tug over his lap, hiding an erection that he was still sporting either from his dream, Flint&#39;s presence, or just because it was morning. Flint had managed to get an eyeful anyway from the way he was smirking. &quot;I&#39;ve already seen you naked, Alex. I helped get you into that bed.&quot; He still laughed a bit as Alex felt his cheeks heating up at the thought. &quot;If you want to fix that though, I put some clothes in the dresser for you. They&#39;re mine, so, you&#39;re welcome.&quot; He said with another smile.<br />
<br />
Flint hesitate for a moment, as if he wanted to walk over to Alex, but instead headed to the door. &quot;I&#39;ll be downstairs if you need anything, just holler.&quot; And with that, the black haired young man left the room, leaving Alex alone once more.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Alex stood and despite his stomach rumbling at the smell of the food he headed right for the dresser. A few steps away and a wave of vertigo hit him, he tumbled forward and managed to grab the end of the dresser, his nails feeling like they were digging into the wood. After a moment, it passed, and he caught his breath. His hands still clutched the corner of the dresser, the leading to where his hands were were gouges in the wood, looking like claws had dragged through them. That had to have been there already, no way his nails did that.<br />
<br />
He lifted his head, peering into the slightly cloudy mirror in front of him. His brown hair was a disheveled mess, and it looked like he hadn&#39;t shaved in days, if he had been the type to grow stubble. Alex had never been very gifted on the facial hair front, or any body hair for that matter, but he lifted a hand to touch his cheek, feeling the prickly hairs. The looked down, running his fingers across his chest, feeling the few hairs growing in the middle of his chest. Nor had he been imagining that faint definition his chest now sported, tracing the lines of the muscles with a finger.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, deciding to worry about it later, and yanked open the drawer to see a few changes of clothes folded inside. The pants were the same baggy type Flint had been wearing, and they had a tie at the front that allowed him to cinch them up as they were definitely a bit too big for him. As was the shirt, short sleeved with the lacing on the chest. He may have been of a height with Flint, but didn&#39;t nearly match the other man for bulk. But despite a recent washing, the fabric held traces of that wonderful scent, making Alex lift the front of his shirt to his nose and inhale. As if a guy like that would go for him.<br />
<br />
Soon, he could no longer ignore his stomach and went to eat, pushing open the room&#39;s lone window to get some fresh air as he did so. Luckily, the window looked out over some sort of town square, cobblestoned and with a well in the center. A few market stalls were set up, and people went about their morning routine as Alex watched.<br />
<br />
The longer he watched, the more he noticed the oddities. Not everyone looked human. Some were quite noticeable, like the hulking man with green skin and tusks, or another with goat legs. Some were close but just a little off, like the slender man with pointed ears, or the squat bearded fellow that was just a bit too bulky for his height. Alex&#39;s nerd brain placed fantasy race names to them, whether he was wrong or right.<br />
<br />
The second difference took him a bit longer to notice. Everyone seemed to be male. Some looked feminine such as the elf-looking fellow, but had a distinct lack of breasts, some wore clothing that left no question as to their gender, and many of the men seemed to like to go around bare chested, or wearing tops that displayed arms and torsos, like Flint&#39;s vest. Alex was the most thrown when he saw an athletic young man that looked quite visibly pregnant, which he thought was confirmed by a more muscular man placing a hand on the swollen stomach and kissing the other man in a way that spoke of a long term couple.<br />
<br />
He was eating the last few bits of bread as the door opened. Flint came in followed by who he assumed must be the healer, though the image did not match what he had been expecting. Alex had expected some older man, but this man was thirty at most, with long blond hair ties back, and a short neatly trimmed beard. His ears were slightly pointed, though he appeared human otherwise, and Alex really hadn&#39;t expected the lean, athletic build that his form fitting clothing revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of bed?&quot; The healer asked with a grin. &quot;Well, it looks like you managed to dress and eat, so I guess that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m Martim, the town physician. Do you mind laying on the bed so I can check you over. Thank you, Flint.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Mart.&quot; Flint said with a casual familiarity, and turned to leave.<br />
<br />
Alex reached out a hand, &quot;Wait.. can you stay?&quot; He winced at the slight pleading tone in his voice, and more so as he watched the other two men exchange glances. Finally, the healer nodded his assent.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want, sure.&quot; Flint said, with a tone that was a mix of surprised and unsure.<br />
<br />
Alex stood a headed over to the bed, and Flint took the vacated chair, as Martim set down a bag and began to rifle through, pulling out some tools that seemed familiar, and a few not so. What proceeded was a complete physical, most of which Alex was used to. Listening to his heart, checking his eyes and throat, even a hernia check which made him blush as he was sporting another slight erection due to Flint&#39;s presence. It didn&#39;t seem to bother Martim though. &quot;So, your name is Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, as the doctor continued his examination and questions. &quot;And where do you come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm.. I&#39;m not sure..&quot; Alex started, getting a concerned look from the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your memory missing?&quot; He asked, alert.<br />
<br />
Alex just shook his head. &quot;No. I, um, it&#39;s hard to explain. I know where I&#39;m from, I&#39;m just not sure you&#39;d know it. I, well, this is going to sound weird, but I went to bed at home and woke up in the forest..&quot; Alex stalled out, not sure how to tell the rest of the story, but the healer held up a finger to quiet him anyway. He pulled something out of his bag that looked like a crystal monocle, and placed it in front of one eye to look at Alex through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting..&quot; Martim murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot; Flint asked, even before Alex could.<br />
<br />
&quot;It happens sometimes, especially when the gods are feeling fickle. They bring someone here from another world. Alex here is not from here.&quot; Martim nodded, lowering the lens. &quot;His aura is out of alignment with the local energies, though it is starting to adjust. A few weeks and it will be as if he had been born here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex felt himself pale a little. &quot;So you believe me? Is there a way back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martim nodded. &quot;If you can convince the god that brought you here to return you home. Or perhaps a powerful wizard could. I&#39;m not fully versed in that sort of magic, but I would think it would need to be done before your energies aligned, otherwise there would be no way to know to which realm to send you. Though, this isn&#39;t a terrible place to be, I&#39;d say.&quot; He reached out and patted Alex on the shoulder. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry. But the good news is I&#39;m taking you off bed rest. A couple of days taking it easy and you should be fine. I have another house call to make, Flint, could I talk to you a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex sat up as Flint stood and gestured to him. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Then the two men walked out the door. Quietly as he could, Alex went a pressed his ear up against the door. The wood was thick, but he could still make out some things.<br />
<br />
&quot;... stunt... fine... adjusting.&quot; That was Martim.<br />
<br />
&quot;... realm... problem...&quot; Flint&#39;s deep voice was tinged with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;... sure... smelled?... careful.&quot; Martim&#39;s a bit harsher, but concerned as well.<br />
<br />
Alex quickly scurried back to his bed as he heard the two men part, just in time to be seated as Flint slipped back through the door. &quot;Sorry. I didn&#39;t know you were more than some poor soul who got lost and maybe robbed in the woods.&quot; He said once the door was closed behind him.<br />
<br />
Alex just shook his head. &quot;Wasn&#39;t a topic I knew how to bring up. Not that we&#39;ve really had a chance to talk.&quot; He scooted over, making some room on the bed for Flint to sit next to him, luckily the other man noticed the invitation and accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we haven&#39;t.&quot; Flint said, settling down next to Alex, their shoulders brushing and bringing some heat back to Alex&#39;s cheeks. So close, that smell filled his nostrils, making him almost dizzy from the euphoria. &quot;So what do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you smell so good?&quot; Alex asked, before he realized the words were even leaving his mouth. He was leaning in, practically sniffing at Flint&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Flint asked, a bit of a laugh in his voice as he looked over at Alex. He was about to say something else, but Alex leaned forward and kissed him. Flint seemed a bit stunned at first, but soon melted into the kiss, putting one of his large hands to the back of Alex&#39;s neck and eagerly meeting that bold kiss with one of his own.<br />
<br />
Alex reached up and pushed back one side of Flint&#39;s vest, running a hand over his lightly furred pecs and up to his shoulder, digging his fingers into the muscle as he felt them flexing under his touch. He felt Flint&#39;s other hand on  his thigh, slowly moving up to his cock. Alex soon returned the favor, his hand sliding down over Flint&#39;s abs to the waistband of his pants, fingers slipping under.<br />
<br />
Flint broke their kiss and gently put some space between himself and Alex. &quot;Sorry, Martim said you need to take it easy and, as much as I want to, that is not taking it easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heat rose in Alex&#39;s cheeks as he leaned back against the wall, feeling suddenly embarrassed. &quot;Sorry, I just, I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot; It was that smell, he couldn&#39;t think straight with it flooding his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, if you weren&#39;t under orders I would have happily let that go further.&quot; Flint stood up, and to Alex&#39;s satisfaction, he had to adjust himself in his pants which were noticeably tented. &quot;Maybe we can pick that up in a day or two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex just smiled, then looked out to the window. &quot;Wait.. I do have one question.&quot; Flint had been headed to the door, but turned to look at Alex curiously. &quot;Are there any women in this world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint frowned, then shook his head. &quot;Never heard of a race going by that name, maybe if you describe them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;Never mind, doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint nodded. &quot;Well, I have to go take care of this before I go back down to work.&quot; He said, motioning to the still quite obviously tented fabric of his pants, Alex couldn&#39;t keep a slight grin from his face at the confession. &quot;Though if you&#39;re feeling up to it, maybe you can come down and keep me company later?&quot; Flint didn&#39;t wait for an answer though, instead slipping out of the room and closing the door behind him.</p>
