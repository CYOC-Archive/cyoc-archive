<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The animorphs were ready to face any threat thought the trees and with some crashing and crunching of bracken the two hulking Bear forms appeared, they were upright on two legs, but did not smell angry.<br />
The biggest one came out first- he had brown fur and a massive build; his arms bigger than Jason’s legs and ending with wicked looking claws. Jason couldn’t help but notice his massive cock was semi-erect. The Bearmans eyes found and locked onto the she-Bear with a hunger Jason recognised. As he lumbered forward and Jason could study him better he realised he somehow recognised the Bear<br />
“Dick” he cried. The Bear man turned his massive shaggy head and his small eyes narrowed.<br />
“Jason?” he rumbled in a deep bass voice.<br />
“Yeah. Damm the change was good to you. You lost years!” Dick rumbled.<br />
“Well I lost a lot more than that” he said “I….” he was interrupted by the other Bear man crashing into the clearing. Jason spotted the huge semi-erect member on him too.<br />
“Rob, come forward to say hello to Jason” Dick called. The massive Bearman stepped up<br />
“Bloody hell” he said. “The new look suits you” he said a big fanged grin on his face. <br />
“You look good to Rob. The lighter fur suits you” <br />
<br />
Dick and Rob were surveying the lined up animorphs. Especially the she-Bear.<br />
“The virus works well” Dick said. Jason nuzzled his mate<br />
“Oh yeah” he said. <br />
“Wanna introduce?” Rob said.<br />
“Well, this is Kern, the ranger round here” Kern stepped forward and shook their hand/paws.<br />
“A damm Strange, if interesting night” Kern said.<br />
“And this is May, Rocky, Rachael, Herne, Rick, Sid and…..” Jason faltered at the she-Bear<br />
“Ursula” she said with a small tilt of her head. The two Bears members twitched at her voice. Jason saw the look of hunger in the two Bear men’s eyes. <br />
“Guys, lets go look at the Jeep and see if we can find a spot to bury it” he said. <br />
“Good idea” Kern said getting the right signals. They led the animorphs away from the Bears.<br />
<br />
Ursula looked at the two huge males. Normally the males would fight for her attention, but now she knew she would be able to have them both. She smiled as the came towards them. The bigger one went to say something but Ursula put a clawed finger to his muzzle and said ‘shhhhh’ Dick stood there open mouthed, he was finding it hard to think, the she-Bear in front of him was putting out pheromones, making it hard to think. He tried to recall the periodic table but was interrupted by a jolt of pleasure as Ursula grabbed his thickening cock. Next to him Rob was grunting in pleasure as she pumped his erect cock up and down. <br />
<br />
Ursula pulled Rob’s cock downwards making him fall to his knees with a heavy thud. Kneeling she pushed her face into his chest and began licking down his furry pecs, and across his big belly. Rob was growling in pleasure as she took his big thick cock in her mouth. With a jerk downwards she got Dick to kneel too, he needed to prompting though to line up behind her, he rubbed his cock into her ass crack making her moan around Rob’s thick penis. Dick was leaking pre-cum onto her ass; higher thought was all gone now as he plunged his dick into her pussy he let out a low growl of pure animal pleasure as his cock was enveloped by her silky smooth lips. <br />
<br />
The three bucked back and forwards. Ursula was good; she kept Rob on the point of boiling over until she felt Dick was ready to blow himself. She clamped down on Dick and began to bring Rob to the boil. Just as Rob could take no more she came herself which sent Dick over the edge. The Bears roared their approval into the night sky as the orgasm washed over them. Ursula collapsed onto Rob’s arms, Dick still buried inside her. The three of them grunting their pleasure. Rob let himself fall over backwards, taking Ursula with him. Dick’s cock popped out of her and sprayed them both with cum. Dick looked at the two of them and started to roar with laughter, that set Rob off and then Ursula higher laugh. <br />
“You will both make good partners” she said<br />
“There is another Bear” Rob said. “Smoky” <br />
“Then all three of you can be good to me” she said grinning “you can make me have many multiple orgasms” Dick started laughing again <br />
“Maybe we will” he said coyly. “Or not” Ursula gave a playful punch that would of knocked out most Humans<br />
“Ow” he said not really hurt. <br />
<br />
A noise got there attention, just on the edge of the clearing where the three missing wolves. Between them they were carrying a dome tent, which was moving of its own accord. Jason and the others appeared.<br />
“What’s that” Dick said taking command. He stood walked towards the wolves. <br />
“We found it in the woods” the Alpha Wolf said. “He had been touched by an animorph and we thought he met get him back here quickly”<br />
“What are your names?” Rob asked, pulling himself to his feet. He saw the wolves noses flare as they caught the scent of recent sex. <br />
“I…called myself Moonrun” the Alpha said proudly, his steel grey eyes locked with Rob as if challenging him to contradict his choice. <br />
“I am Moonslight” the female alpha said, equally as proudly. Rob realised she was only an inch shorter than the male. She was certainly a beautiful catch for any wolf. The last wolf looked to Moonrun before saying anything; Moonrun did not say anything but Rob could detect a subtle shift in the scent he was giving off.<br />
“I am called Moonhowl” he said in a clear voice.<br />
“We are a pack” Moonrun said clearly “we work together, but here, now in this situation we all one pack. I have seen Humans moving through the woods. They are carrying…..” he seemed to struggle for the word……”weapons. Large black ones. I could smell the sleep position they used on my old Alpha once too”<br />
Jason called out<br />
“Were they in black or grey clothes?” The Wolves looked at each other and wordlessly communicated.<br />
“Black” Moonrun answered.<br />
“Not TransGene then” Jason said. The Gun Grey uniforms of TransGene were well known to his team.<br />
“Not TransGene” Dick confirmed “Moonrun, where did you see them?”<br />
“Down towards the clearing that contains many of these” he brushed the tent they were still effortlessly holding. The tent had stopped moving about. <br />
“Why did you take that one?” Kern asked peering down at the wolf.<br />
“Because the one inside had been touched by one of us. We could smell the scent on him. We could also smell sex and assumed that he would change like us when we mated after drinking from the stream”.<br />
“Well let’s open it up” Dick said gesturing the Wolves to put the tent down.<br />
<br />
Gently the wolves put the dome down onto the earth. There was some slight movement inside. <br />
“We are not going to hurt you” Dick said putting his muzzle close to the tent “however we look a little different than you might expect. Do not be alarmed” There was no response. Dick took a deep snuffle- he could smell the Human inside, and indeed some sort of animorph linger, squirrel, or badger, something like that. <br />
“Can you hear me?” again no response.” Ok then I am coming in” Dick grabbed the top of the nylon-plastic tent and ripped it open like an orange. It was not even a strain on his enormous Bear muscles. Inside in a foetal position was a young Human male, about 24-26, black hair, largish build but no jock. He was dressed in a t-shirt on top and his trousers and underwear were round his ankles. Dick blinked and then looked to see if he was alright. He put a paw-hand on the mans shoulder and the Human nearly jumped out of the ruined tent. He rolled over to face Dick and his eyes were wide and his dick stone hard. <br />
“Ohmygod,ohmygod, ohmygod” he said quickly. Quicker than Dick could react the Human grabbed his paw-hand and was petting it slowly.<br />
“Your real” he said breathlessly with a Canadian accent. Dick stood there and looked around the clearing<br />
“Help!” he mouthed to Rob. Rob came over and grunted when he saw the mans state. He grabbed the mans pants and trousers and hitched them up onto his torso<br />
“Cover up kid, you got company” The stranger looked from one of them to the other and then raised himself up so he could see the glowing eyes and bulky forms of the animorphs around him. He grabbed his trousers, his erection forgotten and pulled them up over himself. <br />
“Wow. It’s like Christmas” he said.<br />
“What’s your name kid?” Kern said. The stranger turned towards Kern and his herd and his dick went painfully erect. His mouth formed a perfect ‘o’ as he stared at the moonlit lit Stags. <br />
“I asked you a question kid” Kern barked. The man stopped goldfishing and answered<br />
“I, I, urm, I’m Carl Douglas” he managed. “I love furries” he added. There was a blank look back at him.<br />
“So why where you in the clearing on your own. Where the rest of your group?”<br />
“They went down to Otter Falls for supplies. I was left to guard the camp with Tom and Darren. We’d had a full day doing stuff so I was taking a nap. I heard a big bang and came out to investigate. I saw something run into the camp so I went to have a look- it was a sort of Badgerman and as soon as he saw me he charged into me, knocked me flat and took off with a pack of sandwiches. I couldn’t see the other two so I thought I was dreaming and went back to sleep. Next thing I know I’m being carried and I was brought here”<br />
“Ok. Well you’re safe now. If the Hum…er security people had got to you first it could be a different story”<br />
“What going on?” asked Carl looking totally confused.<br />
“A virus has got out that turns mammal life into hybridised bipedal version of themselves. I point to exhibit A- Z here2 Jason said gesturing the assembled people. <br />
“I got to find Tom and Darren!” Carl cried.<br />
“No point at this moment” Rob said calmly “they have either bumbled into a patrol or an animorph. They are likely confined or changed. We can look form them later.” <br />
“But……”<br />
“It’s simple. We have strength in numbers. We go wandering off then….” Dick was interrupted by a warning growl from Moonrun. He was pointing back toward the forest.<br />
“Human coming” he said. <br />
“Scatter” Dick said. With very little noise the animorphs hid in the forest. Dick grabbed Carl and with a hand over the protesting Humans mouth took him into the treeline. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
“Ralph Bennet, you are lost” the young man said to himself. He’d been following the light from the fire, and now that had gone out, he’d been following the scent of burning. He knew he’d never get back to their camp, but if he found the crash their might be a Ranger who could guide him, or he’d sit tight until day break and head back then. He had a flashlight but with the moon out he didn’t want to spoil his night vision with it. He also carried his 1st aid kit and a small flash of whisky ‘for medical reasons’. Ralph was no drinker, he like a few pints, but unlike John he didn’t drink to excess. He didn’t believe it was worth the hangover and humiliation. Also heavy drinking would threaten the body he was building. He’d been making good gains- 6’ 1” and 180lbs of muscle, a good cover of body hair and a good rep with the ladies ensured he was popular on campus. He made good grades too. <br />
“Out here though, it all counts for shit” he murmured as he walked. Like Ted Ralph was more than a little out of his element- give him a swimmers cramp and he could fix it, out here? Lost confused and tried. <br />
<br />
Ralph stopped and sniffed the night air. He could still smell the burnt smell, just, and something else. He couldn’t place it…it was almost sweet. He carried on towards the burn smell but somehow got the smells crossed and changed paths. The sweet scent carrying his feet forward. His cock began to get hard even though he couldn’t tell you why. Then he spotted something in front of him, appear to be a tent<br />
“Hello?” he called. From the tree line he heard a branch snap.</p>
