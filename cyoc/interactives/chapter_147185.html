<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will studied the stats for himself that had appeared alongside his image on the screen.  He knew that this obviously had to be some sort of gag or something - but it was a pretty elaborate one.<br />
<br />
&quot;May as well try it out and see,&quot; he mumbled.  He read over the stats and with a smile changed some of them.  They now read:<br />
<br />
NAME: Porter, Wendy Denise<br />
AGE: 18<br />
GENDER: F<br />
HEIGHT: 160 cm (5&quot; 3&#39;)<br />
WEIGHT: 60 kg (132 lb)<br />
ADJUST CLOTHING: Yes<br />
DURATION: 1 hour<br />
TIME TO TRANSFORM: 30 seconds<br />
<br />
He started to adjust the Awareness button to &quot;Universal&quot;, but something held him back - after all, if there was even the smallest chance that the thing worked, he&#39;d be stuck as a girl and never even know it.  Ridiculous, sure, but... So he left it as it was.<br />
<br />
That ought to do it, Will thought, so he pressed the button marked &quot;Begin&quot;.  A little 30-second countdown window appeared and began ticking off time.<br />
<br />
[30]<br />
He immediately felt a tingle run the course of his body.  What the hell?!? he thought as he bounded to his feet.  But he had little time to contemplate this before he realized that something was, indeed, happening.<br />
<br />
[25]<br />
The room appeared to be enlarging before Will&#39;s eyes.  No, that wasn&#39;t right - Will was, in fact, shrinking.  He looked down and saw that he was slowly contracting towards the floor.  He could also tell that he was getting smaller, thinner, losing some of his muscle tone.<br />
<br />
[20]<br />
&quot;Bloody hell!&quot; he exclaimed, noticing as he did that his voice was pitching higher.<br />
<br />
[15]<br />
Will felt an odd pulling at his crotch, as if it was being - rearranged?  This can&#39;t be happening!  This can&#39;t be happening!  he thought.<br />
<br />
[10]<br />
Will felt an increasing pressure on his chest.  He looked down just as the flesh around his nipples began to swell outward.<br />
<br />
[15]<br />
As Will watched his breasts form, he felt something tickle the back of his neck.  He reached up and pulled it forward.  It was hair - *his* hair, now grown down to the middle of his shoulders!<br />
<br />
[00]<br />
The computer beeped, and Will looked up at it.  The screen now read &quot;TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Will - or rather Wendy - gaped down at her new form.  She was a now a petite girl.  Her breasts weren&#39;t overly large, but not having had any before, they seemed quite massive to her.  She wore a silk blouse the same color blue as Will&#39;s cotton shirt had been, while his slacks had become a black wraparound skirt that ended just above her knees.  Her lovely legs were encased in a pair of nylons, and Will&#39;s black oxfords were now a stylish pair of red pumps.  Beneath her clothes, Wendy could tell she was also wearing a lacy bra and panties.  Her nails were longish, excellently manicured, and painted a glossy scarlet.  She wore a delicate gold bracelet, a handsomely delicate woman&#39;s watch, and she could feel a pair of hoop earrings dangling from her lobes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m - I&#39;m a woman!&quot; gasped Wendy Porter in a voice much higher than before.  &quot;Unbelievable!  The thing actually worked!&quot;  She spent about a second just being amazed, then she laughed.  &quot;Oh my God, I can do anything with this!&quot;<br />
Will....now Wendy, sat in front of the computer in a daze, this was wonderful. It was a new feeling, one he had always wondered about, not that he was gay or anything, but it had always fascinated him. The thought of being a woman for a short period of time. Being graceful, sexy, cute and notably empty in the crotch area, at least in the familiar manner.<br />
<br />
Wendy stood up, walking to the full length mirror, checking herself out in it. She was gorgeous, or at least cute. If had been her old self, he&#39;d have been all over this pretty little thing. She stood at an angle, framing her body with her hands, she cupped her breasts, feeling a slight wave of pleasure. She pushed them together, showing ample cleavage in the mirror. They were petite, and perky at the same time. Moving down her body, she could feel a fit stomach.<br />
<br />
Moving her hands down to her ass, she smiled. &quot;Nice and plump... irresistible.&quot; She said with self-glorification. Her legs were nice and slender, made especially beautiful with the red pumps. Wendy cautiously moved her hands from her beautiful ass, toward her crotch, slowly feeling herself through the cloth, rubbing herself slowly. She gasped..&quot;That...was definitely different.&quot; That was with one touch, she could only imagine what it would feel like with more exploring.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be more time for that, later.&quot; Wendy said with a mischievous smile. She loved hearing her own voice, it was adorable. The lips that let those words escape were perfectly pouty. Her face was something out of a magazine, the nose was small and petite. Her eyes were deep blue, just as wonderful to gaze upon as the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
Wendy&#39;s smile never left her beautiful face. &quot;I&#39;ll have to see the rest later...when the sun goes down.&quot; With that, she turned to the computer, walking toward it, she began clicking. &quot;Wendy Porter, huh?&quot; She couldn&#39;t very well go back to being Will just yet, there was too much to explore and one hour would just not cut it, especially seeing as he was down to five minutes already. &quot;Forty-Eight hours should work fantastically.&quot; She said as she adjusted the time, it would give him the weekend and plenty of fun.<br />
<br />
Planning on giving Megan the age old excuse of going out of town on business, that would be perfect. Wendy smiled once more. &quot;This&#39;ll be great...what else.&quot; Megan always stayed at her own place when Will was away, so the mansion would still be a good place to crash. She didn&#39;t want to adjust reality to fit the new person, she thought that would just be too strange.<br />
<br />
Wendy clicked on the clothing options, she wanted to make some minor adjustments. She changed the panties to a thong, making her gasp at the sudden strange feeling of something riding up her ass crack, one she&#39;d never felt before. Next she changed the bra to a strapless and made sure it matched the material. Then the blouse changed to a pink tube-top. She made the skirt a mini and made sure it was pink. It showed off her perfect thighs. Next, the stocking and the pumps evaporated replaced by a pair of pink flip-flops.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that no more adjustments needed to be made. She shutdown the program. As she walked by the mirror, she picked up her purse (formerly Will&#39;s wallet), she noticed that she looked like a college girl about to enjoy her summer vacation. Walking toward the kitchen, she wrote the note from Will, telling her that he&#39;d be gone all weekend and that he loved her and he&#39;d see her when he got back.<br />
<br />
Wendy smiled, walking out of the mansion, toward her car. As she got in, she adjusted the seat to her new height, winking at herself in the mirror, she smiled. &quot;Time to hit the strip gorgeous.&quot;</p>
