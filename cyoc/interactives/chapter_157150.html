<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As John opened the bathroom door and tossed his towel onto the shower rail, he recalled his relationship to Simon, the men were young when they had grown up with no real father figure in their lives. Heavy footsteps thudded through the house as he pulled aside the shower doors and slipped into the warm, inviting steam, his bulk canvassed with water as he begun to wash off the day and his worries.<br />
<br />
Yet, as his cock pumped with blood with the thought of “Daddy”, John felt a slight haziness as the Chronivac influenced his memories ever so subtly, Simon’s fear and initial respect for his previous father had melded into a newfound slight jealousy and fear of his big brother’s domineering shadow, one that was more than 55 lbs over him and held many prestigious fitness awards for his prowess in bodybuilding. John’s mind clashed with his inherent fatherly nature, the old worker who was strict on his son and had no true idea what complexities had gone on in his mind fashioned themselves into a positive, active role model that sought Simon’s best interests in heart. John lathered his massive chest as he reminisced over he and Simon’s close bond as John had taken up bodybuilding to pursue a new dream, one where he could protect Simon the way their missing parents could not, as well as to indulge himself in the pursuit of strength. <br />
<br />
John huffed as felt himself swirl his fingers over his thick, aroused nipples, strength and brawn had quickly become his motif, forging not only a titanic physique, but a voracious appetite to continue to grow as large as possible and be the biggest bodybuilder that he could possibly be. The Chronivac continued to rewrite John’s lingering memories, though try as it might, it could not change the slight doubt in John Sanderson’s mind about his… brother, Simon Sanderson. It felt off, it felt like as if time had became fleeting despite his hang out with Simon the other day, John grunted as his right hand began to lather his semi-hard cock and fondled his now bulging balls as his memories of instilling Simon’s once strict lifestyle for one of a mellowed brotherhood, where he had once fondly supported Simon’s decision to join him on his gym photoshoots and later would follow him to his workouts until he had went pro. Pride swelled in his engorged chest as John splashed water onto the slabs of meat. He ran a hardened palm onto the crevices of the chest, lightly bouncing them as he felt for any instance of flab.<br />
<br />
Next came the chiseled abs that the Adonis had spent nearly years building, he felt the mass and exhaled, lathering them before gently spreading the soap suds from his abdominals to his Adonis belt and recalled how hard he wanted to progress in his bodybuilding career. He could have followed the lazy man’s route, bulked dirty and cut so hard that dehydration would have left him stagnant, but John Sanderson was not that sort of man, no. John had dedicated his time and energy, learning about the science of what foods to eat, benching weight after weight while experimenting on diets and supplements before creating the perfect blend of protein supplements that gave way to his god like proportions… Or so the Chronivac had weaved for his memories. The “real” John Sanderson was kept neatly organized onto the file screen that Simon had left behind, before the “new and improved” John distanced himself further from his original counterpart. <br />
<br />
There would be no reason now to return to what once was, with a career like that, a wife like that, and the “close” bond of two brothers who were attempting to recreate their relationship that had somehow been broken. The muscleman turned around, letting the shower wash away both the suds and his handsomely cut hair as he kept his eyes close, grunting as he felt himself knock gently between the walls as his lats had become large wings that sought to squeeze his mass between a tiny space. In preparation of this, the Chronivac began to weave another edit, changing the once average man’s bathroom to a luxuriously spaced master bathroom, the bleak white and blue colored aesthetics fell away and turned into a marble white and brown fashion, a large mirror that could fit up to 3 people and 2 sinks had brought themselves into existence as John continued to grow, his legs shifting their increasing weight as his ass bubbled into a near undergarment swallowing size, they moved and jostled much like his upper body’s pectoral muscles.<br />
<br />
John sighed, craning his neck to catch the rest of his massive traps as they bulged from the thickened bull like neck he had improved from his own edit. His dick pulsated, throbbing as it too had gained a slight improvement and stood at attention as he lathered his hands and arms, the biceps had become rock solid in their journey from once saggy, shapeless forms to defined melons that threatened to tear apart his dress shirts. He growled slightly, flexing them as if imagining himself in a crowd, the cheers and screams as he wore a once pristine suit and tie, only to shake off the suit jacket and bunch the shirt’s sleeves onto his massive arms. The fabric would creak, begin to snag on the rounded peaks, and then tear, the crying of the shirt only goading John to tear the buttons off next, right after he tore the sleeves from his titanic arms and allowed the photographers and admiring fans to ogle his inviting chest. <br />
<br />
Feeling himself, John opened his eyes groggily, eager to have finished his shower and turned the dial of the shower off, stepping out into an at first unfamiliar bathroom, but as the Chronivac continued its job, John realized his master bathroom was all but a part of his kingdom. He, like a king, a god, had made his home in such a style befitting a behemoth like himself. He smirked, seeing the towel he once had failed to wrap around his waist and eyed himself in the mirror, like Narcissus, he fussed and preened himself before winking in his reflection and opening the door to an empty bedroom. Kim had likely been still watching her television debut, and so, he had about an hour to take some time for himself… Maybe watch a bit of his competition’s posing videos for… Pleasure, and “references”, and check his current goals before starting his next workout. <br />
<br />
John let the towel drop unceremoniously on the floor, posing like a poised showman as he picked the cloth and tossed it away and opened the room’s trophy closet. The bodybuilder entered the room with a sense of sacred respect, eyeing his reflection in the sheen of the golden trophy and ceremoniously pulled the TV Remote from its perch. With the intent of worshipping himself in comparison to the lesser, weaker competition, John crawled onto the bed with a feral lust, flipping the TV on with the Chronivac and awaited its start up options.<br />
<br />
Upon reviewing his statistics, once more staring at his relationship with Simon listed as “Previous: Father” for a few seconds before the call of the Chronivac beckoned him to adjust his weight. The Chronivac labeled his body type as “Muscular, professional bodybuilder”, to which the elder Sanderson’s cock sprung to life once more, as he proceeded to pump his erect dick, he clicked “Add Weight To Subject”. The titan moaned as he thought of pumping himself up another 5… Maybe 10 pounds, maybe he could attain a new max in a year, change his projected stats to 31 years old at 295 lbs… The possibilities were endless, but what became even more intriguing was Simon’s still current profile, it seemed to beg for John to manipulate it, to make a “dream” stat profile for his little brother that wanted so badly to impress his big, muscular, god-like brother… John lolled his tongue out as he felt his body reach closer to a sexual high. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac alerted him to a new window, one denoting that new options were unlocked for him to use, and as his head began to fog up from the bliss of the new options, the musclebound man pressed “OK” and confirmed he “knew” what the options could do. Before he could move on and change Simon’s profile, John growled as he climaxed, chest covered with warm cum, rubbing the liquid across his body and huskily exhaling a gravely “Fuck… Me…”<br />
_________<br />
<br />
Simon found himself completely spent after running to the gym and realizing that the Chronivac remote was no where to be found in his initial search. He had came home in failure, greeting Kim who was watching some drama tv show about a woman who had somehow fallen in love with some younger man, and slowly drew himself into his room while John had been in the shower.<br />
<br />
Tossing and turning in his bed, he couldn’t help but rummage his brain over where the remote could have gotten, he hadn’t aged a bit, while John had become some, bulging muscle hunk that made him weak in the knees as he flexed his newly rejuvenated body. Simon bit his tongue as he tried to comb the possible location of the Chronivac, wanting not only to had once overage his father and become the man of the house, but to give himself the dream body that John had seemingly been bestowed by the Chronivac. Simon sighed in frustration, his roughly 27 year old body had done wonders in being fit and athletic at a solid 210 lbs, but it paled in comparison to his fath- brother John, who at age 30, was already past 270lbs of pure certified beef and won numerous awards from the new reality he had unknowingly created.<br />
<br />
As Simon laid his weary head to sleep, he swore he could hear the distant moan and constant thumping of his father’s bed on the opposite side of the house, but thought only that his new “brother” would merely awake tomorrow, apologize for the noise due to his incessant lovemaking, and invite him once again to some new gym photoshoot.<br />
<br />
But what Simon did not realize, was that a change would be following him as well.</p>
