<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff trembled, causing the breast to vibrate about gently in the bra-cup, as the sounds of running water and splashing natural liquids continued to grow louder and louder. Within a minute, a babbling brook came into sight, a stout wooden bridge leading over it. Grabbing at the breast instinctively, the same way he would hold his groin while having normal privates, Jeff realized that doing so caused the outline of the hidden shape to become exceptionally clear, not unlike pressing blanket down on a bowling ball. Sheepishly letting go, Jeff looked around, his relief towards nobody having noticed dwarfed in comparison by the urgent desire to make a golden escape.<br />
<br />
Crossing the bridge felt like having to go skydiving while terrified of heights for Jeff: it was unpleasant, unwanted, and caused a tightness in his stomach. However, knowing when he was beaten, he crossed the overpass with his family, his top and bottom teeth all but melding into each other. The sounds of water splashing against rocks, the noise of the current rippling downhill ever so gently, the audible ‘plplplplpl’ of drops passing over fallen branches. Jeff would have found the ordeal funny if it wasn’t for the gnawing need following his every footstep.<br />
<br />
Later down on the trail, Jeff’s family stopped to “take a break”, something the eldest child of the bunch wished he could achieve in his own, personal way.<br />
<br />
Given the opportunity to stand still and think, Jeff pondered if he could just milk his breast through his pants. After all, it couldn’t be too difficult. Even if it was just a few ounces, it would be worth the reduced physical tension. Earlier, back in the car, he hadn’t cared that he was about to wet his pants. When you had to go, you had to go, right?<br />
<br />
Moving away from his family, trying to find a spot where he could discreetly squeeze out the breakfast drink turned bodily enemy, he went to a far stretch of trees overlooking a large ravine. Pretending as though he was admiring the scenery, Jeff - without hesitation - ran his palm over his pants and the breast. No good, it hadn’t been precise enough. Jeff cursed, thinking it couldn&#39;t be that hard to force liquid out of such a full object, even through something as small as a nipple? He tried again, and again. No luck. Realizing his situation, Jeff relented, and looked around. Nobody was watching. Nobody was walking by. Sticking a hand down his pants, he began to clench onto the root of the breast, a quivering sensation of the slightest pleasure radiating through his core, and he-<br />
<br />
“HEY!”<br />
<br />
Shit. Shit, no. Jeff knew that voice.<br />
<br />
Pulling his hand out of his pants, Jeff wheeled around to try and defuse the situation. It was too late, the park ranger from before had seen enough.<br />
<br />
“What did I tell you?! Are you purposefully trying to piss me off?!” Jeff cringed at her choice of words. The ranger’s eyes widened. “Wait. No, don’t tell me… were you…?” She gagged slightly, furious and disgusted. Jeff wasn’t sure what she meant, until she recomposed herself and spoke much louder than he would have liked. “Were you PLAYING with yourself?!”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt blood rush to his face for a number of reasons. One, the idea that this woman thought so little of him that she had seriously imagined he was masturbating in public filled him with a unique mix of humiliation and anger. And two, the volume at which she had said that last part was sure to draw the attention of-<br />
<br />
“JEFFREY.”<br />
<br />
Oh, god damn it.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mother ran over, her expression almost as mean as the ranger’s. She grabbed him by the arm, and Jeff felt the urine bounce about sloppily in the breast.<br />
<br />
“What did I tell you this morning about there being a time and place for that?!”<br />
<br />
For the briefest of moments, Jeff forgot all about the breast, and its overflowing needs. Instead, his mind was solely focused on just how godforsaken and humiliating this moment was, and how he’d rather endure the bladder-busting wait than have to deal with this.<br />
<br />
The park ranger looked at Jeff’s mother, her reaction calming a bit. “I’m so sorry, ma’am. I don’t mean to sound like I’m judging you or anything. It’s clearly all his fault; I tried to tell him not to do this, earlier.” Jeff’s mother sighed, her grip on his arm tightening. “I am so sorry. I’m mortified! I don’t know what I’ll do with him. Boys are just… so uncontrollable.” The ranger nodded, as though the two of them were long lost friends. “Yeah, I get it. Men are so hopeless.” Jeff glanced at his mother, shocked at what the ranger was saying, expecting much more resistance from her, maybe even a confrontation. However, his mother just laughed, nodding along. “They really are.”<br />
<br />
Jeff opened and closed his mouth like a dying fish, incapable of grasping what was going on right now. The unfairness of the moment didn’t seem like it could build any more, until…<br />
<br />
“Man, that felt good!” Jack was striding over, giving Jeff a knowing and mischievous grin. For a second, Jeff’s mother and the ranger diverted their attention from Jeff and instead paid it to Jack. “What felt good?”, his mother demanded.<br />
<br />
Jack shrugged, eyes still on Jeff. “I went. Behind a tree.”<br />
<br />
Jeff would have strangled him on any other occasion, but his loins were too filled with liquid for him to move. Jeff wasn’t sure whether Jack had actually gone or not, or if he was just saying so to spite his clearly still-suffering brother, but the knowledge of the park ranger standing right next to them kept him partially sane. If nothing else, he would be able to have some of the heat taken off of him and directed to his sibling, who was clearly trying to just be a spiteful little prick.<br />
<br />
As Jeff’s mother looked at the ranger, agape, horrified at her middle-child&#39;s audacity in front of a park employee, she began to muster up an apology. The ranger, however, simply smiled. “Using nature’s abundance to your advantage! You’re a resourceful little guy, aren’t you?” Jack nodded, smirking. “I have 39 merit badges!” Jack took almost any opportunity he could to brag about his achievements in The Boy Scouts to others (“admirable and sensational”, his scout master had called them), and it appeared this interaction was no different.<br />
<br />
Actually, no. Jeff, even in his blind state of humiliation, anger, and urinary torment, was able to tell this interaction was very different, particularly from how he had been treated not ten minutes ago by this very same woman. Before he could even say anything, Jack and the ranger were discussing different foraging techniques, types of local wildlife, and even what type of wood made the best canoe. All the while, Jeff’s mother held him firmly in place, subjecting him to this madness.<br />
<br />
After three unbelievable minutes of the two going back and forth while Jeff and his mother watched on, the ranger and Jack ended their conversation. Jeff waited for her to, at the very least, reprimand his younger brother for having done the exact thing she had confronted him about earlier. But, to his disgust, she merely ruffled his hair with a smile before turning to their mother. “Well, just try to keep an eye on… that one, miss”, the ranger said with a tired wave in Jeff’s direction. Jeff’s mother nodded, promising that he’d “get a severe talking to”, or something to that effect. The exact words didn’t register with Jeff, whose mind was awhirl with confusion, anger, envy, and several other such emotions, and the ranger walked off with a final stern glance at him. After her eyes were off of him, for the briefest of moments, Jeff took one last instinctively glance at her chest, which bounced softly with each step.<br />
<br />
“It isn’t fair,” he thought, as she departed. “Why does she get two…” <br />
<br />
Wait, what? What was that-<br />
<br />
Immediately, Jeff was firmly yanked to the right, and his mom was sitting him down on a tree stump, the full breast wobbling about with the bra cup digging heavily into its sides. She began a long and passionate rant about something to do with “I told you” this and “you should know better” that, though Jeff was too caught up in his thoughts to pay any attention.<br />
<br />
What had he just thought about with the ranger’s breasts? “Why does she get two?” It had sounded so bitter, downright jealous, even. This breast, this tit, this boob, hanging between his thighs, currently making his life a living hell for various reasons… why would he want more than one? He wouldn’t, would he? But, it had sounded almost if he cared about the stupid thing. Almost…<br />
<br />
“Do I make myself CLEAR?”, Jeff’s mother asked, ending her tirade while Jack sniggered behind her, hanging around only to witness his older brother being chewed out. Jeff nodded instinctively in his misery, the breast shifting in his lap, its now full and swollen state a hidden testament to his despair.<br />
<br />
Relenting, she gave a displeased nod, and sat down on a nearby rock. Before Jeff could even begin to think about asking what she was doing, she had reached into her bag and pulled out a bottle of water, followed by another one, then another, and another. Jack and their father moved in, taking a bottle each, and began to suckle the clear aqua from the plastic containers. Half of Jeff was distraught while watching the affair due to the torturous reminder of his present desire - nay, his need - to empty out his new, protuberant appendage. The other half, he realized, was left shattered by the affair due to a newfound realization: he was thirsty.<br />
<br />
Much as his present conundrum was caused by an intake of beverages, it was irrefutable that the hike had left his mouth and throat dreadfully parched. However, the former point dominated the latter, and Jeff resigned himself to abstaining from the drinks, at least for the time being. This did not, however, remedy the more serious issue he was facing, and time slowed to a grinding halt as all around him he saw and heard his family members guzzling down their drinks. The stream crossing had been unbearable, but this was somehow worse. Primarily because it reminded him of what had placed him in this urine-filled predicament to begin with.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s father offered him a bottle, and he promptly and miserably rejected it, earning little more than an indifferent shrug from the family patriarch. After a grueling minute, minute and a half at most, the drink break was finished, and the group set out to continue their nature walk.<br />
<br />
As they began a steep uphill tread, Jeff felt now more than ever the sheer weight and sagging fullness of the breast being acted on by gravity, the bra cup continuing to provide a lingering and pronounced wedgie on the enlarging fleshy orb. Jeff resisted the instinctive urge to adjust it, not wanting to draw attention, not wanting to risk that park ranger catching him again, and all with part of him knowing it wouldn’t make a difference. The breast was too full to fit comfortably; even if the makeshift holster was a full cup size larger, it wouldn’t have been big enough to hold the ever-increasing size of the pee-filled body sac.<br />
<br />
The family eventually made it to the top of what seemed to be a mountain, overlooking a small pond and miles of lush greenery. The sight alone made Jeff quiver with longing for what seemed to be the twentieth time today; just the thought of being able to milk it all out into that blue, crystal water in private, or being amongst any of those thousands of cedar beacons of hope, where no one could interrupt him from fulfilling his body’s demands.<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to distract himself, thinking about Brianna and how much fun had had cuddling up next to her and watching the movie. But even this blessed memory provided little respite, as images of the pool shed and his opportunity to empty his bladder, along with memories of the pool water splashing about and the cola he had drunk with Brianna during the film, only added to his fluid-infused mindset.<br />
<br />
The hike continued, and Jeff endured more of the same, with each step like a slap to his water balloon of a crotch, rippling the liquid inner contents. The experience was beginning to repeat, with very few new sensations adding onto Jeff’s meandering inconvenience. It was far from pleasant, but it was at a dormant stage in terms of torment: it wasn’t getting any better, but it wasn’t getting any worse.<br />
<br />
That is, until, the sounds of the falls came within earshot.<br />
<br />
Jeff briefly recalled what his father had said back at the beginning of the nature walk, something to do with “the falls being beautiful this time of year”. The falls, an admittedly impressive forty feet high with small islands of rocks at the bottom, splashed endlessly with gallons upon gallons flowing over the side at the top and crashing noisily against the ground every single minute. The sheer force of the impact shot water particles up into the air, surrounding the family in a spray of moisture that caused Jeff to shed a single tear. He would have sworn at the top of his lungs, if he even had the energy to do so any more.<br />
<br />
He squirmed as gently as he could, moving very similarly to a penguin as he tried to replicate normal human walking, while the rest of the family went ahead to get a view of the massive natural wonder. Whether they noticed his continued plight and were choosing to ignore him, or if all but Jack were unaware of his ongoing battle with his own body, Jeff was unable to tell. And frankly, he really didn’t care at this point.<br />
<br />
After a grueling ten minutes spent reading plaques set up around the falls, taking pictures of the falls, and having their pictures taken with the falls (during which Jeff was forced not only to smile by his mother, but also tuck his legs together so that any iron-clad visual evidence of the breast in his shorts was left out of the photographs), the family began their descent along the nature trail, finally heading back to the car.</p>
