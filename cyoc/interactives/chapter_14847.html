<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your skin is in the midst of change! It feels oily maybe from the liquid you drank first but with there patches of color the final fear of being transformed has now settled in your gut.<br />
<br />
Returning to your bed one lays down naked except for the damp bath towel wrapped around your waist. Thinking of one's person, your body and the temple of where your soul resides, transformed, transforming, you begin to cry.<br />
<br />
Tears flow as the all too real fact has hit home that what you are is not what you will remain. The thoughts of those you've met these past couple of days runs over in your mind. Compassionate feelings for Florence the young lady thinking she was to become a female satyr and live in a private nudist camp. If she only knew of the wretchid idea the Doc had for her and her friends, this makes you angery.<br />
<br />
Thoughts turn to that nice fella on the plane Jeff something the name now escapes you. His fantasy of being a Rabbit was not going to be as the Doc for him too had other plans. You roll around on the bed thrashing the sheets with kicking legs and feet your so damned mad.<br />
<br />
You saw so many others who under false pretense had come to volunteer to be a willing part in a scientific test or experiment. The chart you saw in Doctor's golf cart when touring had names of people listed and after their name the species he would make them become. People, human beings he used as fodder, like seeds to be planted and from their live bodies grow out horses, cattle, goats, sheep, swine, and wild zoo animals, beasts made only for the hunt, it was maddening!<br />
<br />
Screaming your hatered for this system of man made destruction of those poor humans so dooped into coming here. Your screams are making the throat raw your voice ragged and hoarse.<br />
<br />
Tossing your bed pillows of the bed, kicking the sheet and blanket off too your now laying there naked even without the towel but you just don't give a rat's ass about it!<br />
<br />
Then sitting up your arms flaying upward your voice screams the names JUSTIN, MARGE, and as the air runs out of your lungs you almost whisper, their kids.......! They were the first real contact which began this your quest for the truth of what happened to them and even a Hippopotamus which saved a boy from certain death.<br />
<br />
Arms fall lip to your sides, you flop down on the bed again as mind floods with the cherrished thoughts of Hank's last pangs for his parents and you a human friend. If the Doctor was on schedule by today Hank would have finalized his mass of changes and be allowed the company of other hogs his size for play. His was to be a simple life of eat wallow and mate. Hank, what he was and might have been was not never to be as he would degrade in mental ability to be nothing more the a lusty boar hog by the time he turned tweleve in his human years.<br />
<br />
The Doc himself said he was a manicale in his ways! He had an on going agenda of what was needed to produce as he transformed humans into one species after another all due to the whims of human wanting new toys. It was like a naughty child loose in a factory. His own private factory where the lives and hopes of those he took from his subjects meant nothing, but only the crazy lust to watch them change, as he schemed for the money he earned made him do even more and more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen!&quot; you yell out as the thoughts of him explode in your present line of thought. As the caretaker, poor guy half man and on his way in time to become a Red Angus cow for Allen's ultimate pleasures! Allen as nice young man of his last year in college being taken by the Doc and reformed from human to a massive 800 pound Red Angus bull. The thoughts of his long sturggle in school. His college study and dreams he had as having been an orphan and by such happening a perfect find for the Doc's radical plans.<br />
<br />
Your so mad that your slapping your arms on the bed which is shaking it from the force. Your screams have so overworked your vocal cords that only high pitched squeaks and squeals comes out the open mouth.<br />
<br />
Your eyes shift looking toward the sides of your room as things which the night before were common items of furniture now represent possible enemies.<br />
<br />
The door to your room opens and the Doctor, three big men and a gurney come into the room.<br />
<br />
A seringe! Yet another in a long line of injections which have taken place during your long night of sleep and will for the next few weeks bring about the final placement of you into the animal world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, try to calm down as your frantic movements are shaking the plaster loose of the ceiling in the foyer. Now this won't even hurt but it will help you calm and make the cell reformation process focus on the bodies' new protein processing.&quot; say Doctor as with his men holding your arms in place and onee laying over your legs he injects the seringe directly into your neck.<br />
<br />
The three men go to work slid you to the one side of the bed lifting your feet up as they drag you onto the concave odd looking gurney. Your body feels stronger but limp at the same time. You oggle one of the men but have a funny feeling in your jaw working it around and around.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get him into building five I note his skin in loosing the oily feel it should need to keep him alive!&quot; states the Doc as the three men move the gurney along with grants and growns. <br />
<br />
Out into the hallway and down to back way to a elevator where your bounced out and into a delivery truck for a short ride to building five.<br />
<br />
Try after failed try you would wish to sit up but your back muscles say a very distinct, NO Way!<br />
<br />
Strapped to the gurney you lay there as Doctor is sitting by you his face all lighted up with a smile of content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having no doubt a rash of thoughts and worries are we, you soon will know what is to be!&quot; he says almost laughing as he watches your face show the fear you now know.<br />
<br />
At last your wheeled out of the truck and into the building which reeks of moist moldy smells. You are moved up to a wall and there the straps are release and the three men roll you off the gurney and, splash you go into a tank of water.<br />
<br />
Instantly some inner instinct takes total control and with wild and perfert ease you swim through the water to again peek out and look up at the Doc.<br />
<br />
One tries to speak but the vocal cords had transformed more that becoming hoarse from screaming your agressive agony. Now you wonder and look to the Doc for him to tell what has happened to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know too much of me and the process, I couldn't make you a bull like Allen as I first planned as your mental abilities might have had a bull writng messages in the sands. I cn't have my situation here compromised, so your where you can't write, can't speak, and will live with your kind in a realm of liquid. An Orca a Killer Whale is your species and form, a fish yet mammal you can think as a man but will live and know your life as a fish of the ocean does. Soon when filled out better you and another will be shipped to a zoo in Florida there to perform tricks and be whales as whales are, do try and enjoy it!&quot; so says the Doctor as he walks out of sight leaving you to become accustom to saltwater and life as a whale.</p>
