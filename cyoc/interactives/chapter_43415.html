<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Oliver turned and saw a new set of clothes on the bench. Gone were her boy clothes. Instead, she saw a pile of folded garments and a pair of wooden sandals. A card was placed on top of the clothes.
<P>Picking it up in her little fingers, Oliver read the card.
<P><I>Dear Masami: Welcome to a new world of adventure! Your clothes have been tailored to fit your exact specifications. As the chosen outfit is rather complex, you may wish to take advantage of our fast-dressing option. Simply press the green transformation button a second time, and you will be instantly clothed in your wardrobe.
<P>Your old clothes have been stored safely, and will be ready to pick up once you have returned to your original form. Thank you for choosing Body Benders. We wish you a delightful experience in your new body!</I>
<P>Oliver read the card twice. It was addressed to someone named Masami. The name sounded strangely familiar. She quickly realized that Masami was the name she would be adopting for her female form.
<P>She turned back to her reflection. Masami clearly matched her better than Oliver. "Masami," she said quietly. She gasped when she heard herself. Her cheeks blushed. She sounded like a real woman. There was even a certain sensuality to her tone.
<P>Masami put down the card and picked up the top garment. It unfolded itself to reveal a beautiful silk kimono. It was blue with white butterflies patterned on it. The trim was a deeper shade of royal blue. There was also a royal blue obi and some undergarments. 
She noticed these didn't seem to include a bra.
<P>She saw a pair of blue panties. They were thin, only designed to cover up the most vital parts of her crotch. She slowly slipped one of her legs into them, then she other, feeling the fabric slide along her smooth skin. They hugged her hips tightly. Their lack of modesty was made up for by their level of comfort.
<P>Masami longed for a matching bra, but the only garments left were the kimono, obi, and a pair of white socks. She sighed. She couldn't tie the obi on her own, and she was too nervous to call someone for help. Then she remembered what the card said. She reached over and pressed the green button again, bracing herself for what was to come.
<P>The light that surrounded her was much dimmer than before. She was able to keep her eyes open without burning her retinas. The warmth, and all the other sensations she had previously felt, were absent this time. She felt slightly disappointed.
<P>The kimono flew into the air and circled around her. Her arms were lifted and gently manipulated as if pulled by invisible strings, allowing the kimono to dress itself. First one sleeve, then the other. It hugged her body tightly as the obi followed, tying itself around her waist with a thick blue bow in the back. She was lifted into the air as the two-toed socks shot onto her feet. The wooden sandals slid underneath her, and she was gently placed down into them.
<P>She saw a flurry of movement in the mirror. Behind her, her shiny raven hair was tossing about. Some of it gathered into a pair of tightly packed buns and was fastened by stringy blue bows. Her cheeks gained a strong blush and her lips intensified into a bright red. Her eyelashes became thicker and longer, and her eyebrows thinned into cute black arches.
<P>The light faded, and the hair that remained unbound fell straight to the floor once again. Masami examined her look with both excitement and apprehension. The blue butterfly kimono was much sexier than she expected. The large V gap on her chest was low enough to show off nearly all of her cleavage. This was made even more prominent by the wide obi, which was wrapped around her midsection so tight it propped up her bosom in a display few men would ignore.
<P>The forearms of her sleeves widened out to an incredible length, as per tradition. The generous amount of material ended around her calves. The density of the butterfly pattern increased the farther down it went.
<P>Below the obi, the kimono seemed to be cut differently. Instead of surrounding her legs entirely, the fabric had been tapered into two strips that fell directly in front and behind her. This left gaps wide enough on either side for her curvaceous hips to pour out, and it seemed there was no pose Masami could strike that would hide enough of them behind the marginal material. At best, the ankle-length flaps of fabric hid only the insides of her legs, but she would have to stand perfectly straight with her feet together to do so. It did more to tease the onlooker than hide the total of her assets from view.
<P>What concerned her the most was the very real possibility that the wrong movement or the slightest gust of wind would treat bystanders to a peek at her skimpy underwear. A careless motion could even allow the kimono to slip from one or both of her shoulders, exposing her bosom. She was even more frightened that the thought of such things was causing her womanhood to tingle.
<P>She examined her overall appearance. With only half of her hair tied up, bright red cheeks and lips, and ample amounts of skin peeking out from her kimono, she looked like a woman boldly seeking the company of sexual creatures.
<P>The realization hit Masami at once: she was a geisha! She didn't look like the most traditional of geishas, but the intent was obvious, even if she didn't have the totally white face makeup and elaborately styled hair. She appeared more like a geisha wannabe. A woman with passion who wasn't afraid of putting out at the drop of a hat.
<P>Masami was now fully aware that these thoughts were turning her on. The heat from her transformation had returned, although subdued. She fancied the idea of pleasuring herself again, this time seeing it all the way through to orgasm. But what interested her even more was the desire to experience such pleasures with a partner.
<P>She tried to get a grip on her mind. Why was she thinking like this? As a boy, Oliver had never been so sexual. Was this a side-effect of the transformation?
<P>She wanted to get some answers, and the only way to do that was to go out and talk to Alice. For a second, the thought of anyone else, even Greg, seeing her like this was utterly embarrassing. This cause for hesitation was quickly washed away and replaced with feelings of pride and obligation. She had a gorgeous body. Why be afraid to show it off?
<P>She turned to face the door. It was bigger than before. Its top used to be just above her eye level, but now it seemed a foot higher. The transformation had shrunk her on top of everything else.
<P>This revelation brought another wave of nervousness at being seen. She again found her mind fighting between fear of embarrassment and eagerness to show off her body.</p>
