<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the old time specticals slipped down into Kevin's shirt pocket he was bubbling with wonder about his find. Even the drive home had him asking questions to himself as what other uses the glasses might have?<br />
<br />
Home again, home again and Kevin left his metal detector in the car along with the coffee can filled to the brim with nicnacks and old coins.<br />
<br />
Rushing into his house he went directly to the kitchen getting himself a glass of ice and to the fridge for the decanter of iced tea. Then off to his study where in quite he could again study his find.<br />
<br />
The tea poured, he looked about for one of his dark chocolate candy bars. As none could be found he rushed off to the fridge to retrieve one of his personal joys of life. A fast walk back to the study had Kevin ready for a Saturday afternoon adventure.<br />
<br />
Easing down into his grandfather's leather and oak swivel chair he was sitting at his desk. A yellow legal pad and three ink pens were laid out side by side all neat and prim. A sigh, &quot;There we're ready a place for everything, and everything in it's place!&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooned had Kevin repeater his favorite phrase than he began to laugh. Now with the glasses in his posession his phrase would not fit Kevin anymore as he would be out of place when they were worn.<br />
<br />
Slowly he took the fraile feeling specticles out of his pocket and gave a nervous lookover of the frames. It was then that under his desk lamp he noticed the minature writing which circled each lense and spiraled down the temple and ear part of the glasses.<br />
<br />
Opening them out Kevin put them on his head snuggling the glasses up his nose and wrapping the springy ear piece over and behind his ears.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the room was filled with vague forms of people Kevin had not seen in years. Friends, coworkers, and even his sister from far off in the Western states. Everybody was milling about as one by one they walked over and gave an examining look at Kevin.<br />
<br />
Then everybody grew quiet as Minister Alton entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;May we begin, its looking like rain outside and having a service at graveside in the rain is so depressing!&quot; announced the Rev. Alton.<br />
<br />
Standing to Kevin's right the man bowed his head and after a moment opened his eyes and spoke to all there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Friends and relatives of our late brother in Christ, here lays Kevin his untimely death has left us all wondering.....&quot; said the Minister as a funeral service was happening right there in Kevin's study and he was the deceased!<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I dead?&quot; asked Kevin as the Monitor of the specticals answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your's is a vision of the future! Yes what you see is your own funeral service being conducted inside this old royal home you love so much. As this has not yet happened, and since if you are careful the mistake which caused your death might as yet be averted.&quot; replied the Monitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go see the mistake and correct it!&quot; suggested Kevin quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time has rivers, eddys, if one is caught by the currents terrible and unknown events one can be caught up within and live or die in the blink of an eye!&quot; said the Monitor.<br />
<br />
As Kevin continued to watch his own sullen funeral service he had more questions come to mind. &quot;You spoke of Ellen who lost the glasses when she was trapped into another time and form, how did this happen, exactly?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was with her husband Arnold Whinthrope as the newly wedds they were watched the Saturday afternoon Derby. Ellen was given the glasses by her rich and wise Grandmother as a gift on her own death bed. Ellen used them well but in the stroke of a frantic moment as she was watching the finish to a race not yet begun, her lover tried to kiss his new wife and moved to removed her funny glasses. Ellen forgot not to move when watching the future events and stepping back from her Husbands unexpected advances she entered the space of that stallion Seashore Run. In that split second she understood the error of her ways, had it not been for her loving Husband removing the glasses at the same moment she might have returned to her position and been saved. Yet the glasses came off and Ellen's body died, as her spirit of life entered the stallion and together she and the animal shared the body and life of one winning race horse and a prime stud!&quot; explained the Monitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then one should be alone when looking at the future?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;To see both past and future the view can only be for the spot and place your human body exsists within your own time and space. The glasses do not offer time travel from place to place but only sights of what is, or what was as one stands in a place!&quot; explained a little more the Monitor to Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if this be my funeral service how can I find out where it happened and what happened when my death occured?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be of caution as with your left hand first remove the bow from around the ear. Then remove the other bow as each hand holds a bow and then flex them into the reversed side of the framed lenses. Now with the right bow first attach it about the ear. Now the second bow and sit very quiet less you are caught in the river of time!&quot; said the Monitor in a very stern way which scared Kevin.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the sights of Kevin's funeral began to run backwards as a movie in reverse. As the glasses showed the sights Kevin watched as hours flipped by in seconds and days scrolled backwards as well. He saw himself being placed in his coffin. Kevin shuddered as the doctor pronounced him dead. Then was the wild ride in an ambulance which about made Kevin sick as it was traveling backwards up the road from where his death had occured.<br />
<br />
As the ambulance stopped the Monitor said, &quot;Place one hand to the right side of the bow but do not remove it from off the ear!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin did as he was told and the speed to which events passed slowed down. Now he watched as the happening occured and what was his downfall.</p>
