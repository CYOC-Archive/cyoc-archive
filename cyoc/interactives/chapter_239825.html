<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Why don’t we do the Everglades tour, then relax on Miami Beach and after go to a nice restaurant,” the “woman” suggests.<br />
<br />
Mark smiles, “sounds good to me,” he says, “then tomorrow, if that’s okay with you, we’ll visit the science museum”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles, “sure, I’m not really a big fan of science, but we both want our fun,” she says, “so, let’s do what I want today, tomorrow it’ll be your day, how does that sound?”<br />
<br />
Mark smiles, “that sounds like a fair deal,” he says, chuckling, “but we’ll see, maybe I’ll decide to do something else tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Or maybe we could visit the science museum first, then after that maybe do something what we both enjoy”.<br />
<br />
Mark nods, “let’s just focus on today,” he says, “we can still decide what to do tomorrow later or in the morning”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, smiling, “well, why don’t we get ready? We have a long drive ahead of us”.<br />
<br />
Mark nods, “yeah, Miami is about two hours from here,” he says, getting up from the table and grabbing the empty plates, “why don’t you pack our swim stuff and everything we need, and I’ll clean the kitchen?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, “sounds good,” she says, heading up the stairs to get their swimsuits, towels and anything else they need for the trip packed.<br />
<br />
After packing a bikini for her and a speedo for Mark, two towels and sun cream, “Zoey” heads back downstairs and soon they are on their way to Miami.<br />
<br />
Mark pulls into a parking lot at the Everglades two hours later and parks the car, “are you excited,” he asks, smiling as he turns to look at his “wife”.<br />
<br />
“Actually,” the “woman” says, “I am, I wonder what animals we’ll see, I assume we’ll see some birds, snakes, lizards and crocodiles”.<br />
<br />
Mark nods, “it will defiantly be a lot of fun,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” and Mark get out of the car and walk over to the meeting point, after being greeted by the guide, they follow him to the boat, which is an aircraft, and climb in, Mark getting in first, before helping “Zoey” into the boat, the two sitting down.<br />
<br />
An hour later they return, “that was fun,” the “woman” says, “I learned so much about the Everglades and the animals living there, I didn’t know that people dump their pet Pythons there, those snakes were huge!”<br />
<br />
Mark nods, “yeah,” he then shakes his head, “I don’t understand such people, why get a python instead of a small snake or a small lizard?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” nods, “yeah, there are such idiots on this planet,” she says, “sadly, it’s the majority of our species”.<br />
<br />
Mark sighs, he then smiles, “let’s not think about that and just enjoy the rest of our day,” he says, “let’s head to the beach for some relaxation. I can’t wait to cool off in the ocean!”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” chuckles, “neither can I,” she says.<br />
<br />
About half an hour later, Mark parks the car directly near Miami Beach and both step out, smiling as they look towards the beach.<br />
<br />
Mark turns to “Zoey”, “let’s get changed, find a nice quiet spot for our towels and stuff, before hitting the waves”.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, let’s,” the “woman” replies.<br />
<br />
Mark and “Zoey” enjoy the rest of the day swimming in the ocean, playing volleyball and badminton and relaxing on their towels. Jeff is lying on his back, smiling up at the palm leaves swaying in the wind, ‘I must admit, I am really having fun,’ he thinks to himself, ‘spending time with my dad, even as his “wife”, is great. I don’t know why I was so worried and nervous, this isn’t as bad as I thought it would be’.<br />
<br />
As the sun begins to set, they decide to get changed and head to the restaurant someone had suggested: Cecconi’s an Italian restaurant which has a romantic atmosphere.<br />
<br />
When they enter the restaurant a waiter leads them to a nice quiet table and they both sit down, taking the menus from the waiter, “would you like something to drink,” the waiter asks.<br />
<br />
“Yes, bring me a glass of Beer,” Mark says, and before Jeff has the chance to say something, Mark adds, “and my wife will have a glass of Martini, please,” turning and smiling at the “woman”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked, ‘I didn’t know mom drank such a strong drink,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Mark seems to notice the expression in Jeff’s eyes, “or would you prefer something else to drink, babe?”<br />
<br />
‘On the one hand I don’t want to risk becoming drunk, but on the other… I’d like to know what alcohol states like, I’m now a grown woman, an adult. No one knows that I am just a 16-year-old boy in reality,’ he thinks to himself, before smiling, “no, a Martini is fine,” she says, the waiter nods and walks away.<br />
<br />
The waiter returns a few minutes later, placing the two glasses on the table, Jeff picks up his glass of Martini and takes a sip, almost chocking at the strong taste, ‘man, this is some strong stuff,’ he thinks to himself, taking another sip, ‘but it tastes kind of good,’ the teen is unaware that the reason the Martini tastes good, is due to him being his mother and that it’s her favorite drink, and before he knows it, he is already sipping on his third glass.<br />
<br />
“Babe,” Mark says, as “Zoey” orders her fifth glass of Martini, the “woman’s” cheeks red and already pretty drunk, “slow down, you are already over your limit”.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” giggles, “aaaw… *hick*… one more… *hick*… glass won’t hu-hurt,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Fine, but then that’s it,” Mark says, sternly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… yeah,” the “woman” says.<br />
<br />
Mark chuckles, shaking his head, “anyway,” he says, “I’m so pleased that you are enjoying our weekend so far”.<br />
<br />
“It… I… I’m having a blast,” the “woman” says, then giggles, “but… you know what… would make… this weekend even… more fun?”<br />
<br />
Mark senses what his “wife” is talking about, “maybe… we’ll see,” he says, “but not tonight, you are to drunk!”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” grins, “w-we’ll see about… *hick*… that,” she says, rubbing his leg under the table with her foot.<br />
<br />
“Zoey… be-behave,” Mark says, grimacing when he feels his cock begin to harden.<br />
<br />
By the time they return to their lodge, Mark has to half carry and half drag “Zoey” into the house, up the stairs and into the bedroom, “you… really overdone it, Zoey,” he says, lying the drunken “woman” on the bed and starting to undress her.<br />
<br />
Once naked, “Zoey” grabs Mark’s arm, pulling herself up and giving him a kiss on the lips, “please… Mark,” she groans, “please… fuck… fuck me! I need you!”<br />
<br />
“No,” Mark says firmly, “I’m not fucking you in that state,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but,” the “woman” begins.<br />
<br />
“No,” Mark interrupts her, “please, babe… I prefer fucking you when you are yourself, not… not like this!”<br />
<br />
“Asshole,” the “woman” says, “if you would truly love me… y-you’d fuck me no matter in what state I am!”<br />
<br />
“Zoey, calm down,” the man says, “I DO love you, but I just don’t want you to regret it and blame me for taking advantage, I am not like that!”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels himself becoming more and more angry, but a tiny voice tells him to listen to Mark, that the man has a good point. The “woman” lets out a sigh, “fine… but promise… to make it up to me!”<br />
<br />
Mark chuckles, “I promise, the next time we fuck,” he says, “I’ll fuck you four times in a row, how does that sound?”<br />
<br />
“Zoey” grins, “deal,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mark smiles, he then helps “Zoey” into her nightgown, and it doesn’t take long for the woman to pass out. The man chuckles as he strips down to his boxers and climbs into bed, giving his wife a kiss on the cheek, ‘she’ll have forgotten everything in the morning,’ he thinks to himself, ‘she always does,’ and with that, Mark too passes out.</p>
