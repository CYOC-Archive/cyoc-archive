<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Valentine&#39;s Day tended to be a bit more private for Animalians. A lot of it was because where adult or double-dosed Animalians were involved, sex was soon to follow. Still, at least some Animalians were making the effort of going out to a fine dinner first.<br />
<br />
For instance, Abby and Samson were having a nice evening out. Abby was wearing a strapless dress that pretty much required her larger breasts in order to keep up, even though plenty of her cleavage was revealed. A little bit of teasing Samson makes the fun in the bedroom later even better.<br />
<br />
At the moment, Abby and Samson were discussing their friends. &quot;I hope Jessica is holding out alright,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think Roger&#39;s going to neglect her,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s a little bit of the problem though,&quot; said Abby, &quot;It&#39;s getting closer to spring, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Samson before realizing what Abby was implying, &quot;Oh, right. And with rabbits...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Jessica&#39;s smart enough to take precautions,&quot; said Abby, &quot;But she&#39;s definitely feeling the drive. I&#39;m very certain she&#39;s going to bed with Roger on her birthday, if not sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s shown a lot of willpower holding out this long,&quot; said Samson with admiration, &quot;She held out before Sophie and Jessica&#39;s been an Animalian long before her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Sophie, how do you think she and Roland are liking their weekend away?&quot; asked Abby coyly. Both the <i>Pterodactyl</i> pair and the <i>Microraptor</i> couple had gone to Dinosaur City to report on the Valentine&#39;s Day Weekend over there. Well, ostensibly, that was the reason they went there. But a few friends have pulled some strings so that Sophie and Roland can have a weekend together away from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because Sophie and Roland slept together before doesn&#39;t mean they do it at every chance,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do you think that&#39;ll last?&quot; asked Abby flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second night tops,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how long do you think you&#39;ll last tonight?&quot; asked Abby, leaning over to show more of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
There was a small thump on the underside of the table and Samson said, &quot;Abby, you&#39;re going to make a mess in public if you keep that up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby leaned back and said, &quot;Just wanted to make sure you were paying attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, there were some couples were being far less subtle. The Wesley sisters were going to have a lot of fun tonight. Travis&#39;s parents were going out tonight so they had the house to themselves. Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Fleck gave Travis a brief talk about taking precautions and all that, but they let the kids have their fun.<br />
<br />
Simon and Travis may not be taking out the girls for a special dinner, in fact they were just ordering pizza. The double date featured them mostly watching a romantic movie. Malice wanted to put on something a lot more naughty, but Sarah put her paw down. Malice can watch dirty movies on her own time. Tonight, it would be about their boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, the two couples got down to some serious making out. Both husky girls loved the way their breasts squished into their mates&#39; large, muscular chest. They weren&#39;t shy about rubbing against their crotches, making sure they were nice and stiff. Clothes were thrown off pretty quickly after that. But once it was down to their underwear, things took an interesting turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Simon, I&#39;ve talked this over with both Mary Alice and Travis, though you haven&#39;t been part of this discussion,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;For good reason,&quot; grumbled Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you&#39;re ok with this?&quot; asked Travis.<br />
<br />
Malice let out a sigh and said, &quot;Well, she&#39;s egged me into trying this, but I don&#39;t see this as more than a one-time thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot; asked Simon.<br />
<br />
Sarah gave him a smile and said, &quot;Tonight, we&#39;re switching partners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so you and me...&quot; started Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will be having sex together,&quot; confirmed Sarah, &quot;Meanwhile, Mary Alice and Travis will be having their own fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me help you make up your mind,&quot; said Sarah before kneeling before Simon. She pulled off his tented boxers, allowing his wolfhood out. &quot;Hmm...Malice wasn&#39;t exaggerating about you,&quot; said Sarah before she started stroking him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Malice flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting Simon off with a handjob,&quot; said Sarah coyly. The way Simon was moaning, she was doing a good job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a handjob?&quot; asked Malice, &quot;I can do better than that.&quot; She took off her bra and knelt down in front of Travis. &quot;Let&#39;s see what kind of fire hose you&#39;ve got,&quot; she said before taking off his briefs. Her eyebrows went up. &quot;Huh, not too shabby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than you can handle?&quot; asked Travis teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, just the right size for this.&quot; With that, Malice put her breasts on either side of Travis&#39;s dick. There was still enough length for the head to stick out and Malice to start sucking on it.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked over at them and said, &quot;Hmm...going straight to the boobjob. Well, we won&#39;t be upstaged that easily.&quot; She also wrapped her breasts around Simon&#39;s cock before she started suck on it.<br />
<br />
Simon groaned. He had no idea that Sarah was that good with her mouth. Well, he knew Malice was and apparently the girls have compared notes. He could also feel things come to a head. &quot;G-girls, I&#39;m g-getting a little t-too turned on,&quot; he moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; panted Travis, &quot;Can&#39;t keep up...much longer...&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, that just made the husky girls go even faster. The boys groaned and tried to hold back, but they were reaching their limits. The wolf and Dalmatian yelped as they finally let loose. To Sarah and Malice, there wasn&#39;t much of a difference in flavor. But there was certainly enough volume.<br />
<br />
The huskies gulped what they could before coming up for breath. &quot;Not bad,&quot; said Malice, &quot;Travis almost has enough to match Simon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Sarah slyly, &quot;Because Travis can go for more than one round. Can Simon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we see?&quot; asked Malice before she pulled off her panties.<br />
<br />
Before Simon or Travis could say much, they were already entering husky pussies. Privately, they didn&#39;t think there was a lot of difference between Sarah and Malice physically. Sure, Sarah still had her brown hair and brown eyes while Malice lacked tresses and had icy blue eyes. But everything from the neck down was almost identical. So it was easier for the boys to focus on the pumping hips and bouncing breasts and imagine they were still with their mate.<br />
<br />
The girls whined and panted as they rode each other&#39;s boyfriends. It was hard for them to say who was better or worse. It was hard to think at all with this mind-numbing pleasure. It was when the knots started bumping against their lower lips that they really got into a frenzy. By the time the knots were in and sealed, the four of them let out orgasmic howls.<br />
<br />
Sarah let her tongue loll out as she panted. She felt more like a dog than a woman right now. It was hard to imagine she was ever human at all. She turned to Malice and asked, &quot;So, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice sighed and said, &quot;Ok, this was more fun than I thought. But we&#39;re not going to do this every time. Simon&#39;s puppies are mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we&#39;re in a rush for them,&quot; added Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve gotten enough of an earful from my parents tonight about that,&quot; said Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, once we unknot, you wanna swap back?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d swap back right now if I weren&#39;t stuck,&quot; said Malice. She tried to twist off, but all that did was tickle. &quot;But then again, what&#39;s the hurry?&quot;</p>
