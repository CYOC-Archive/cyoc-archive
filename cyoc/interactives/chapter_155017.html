<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once outside, what you and Andrea noticed was the song. Among the destruction caused by the rampaging lizards, the smashed glass, ripped apart fences, and smashed concrete walls, was the song. You and Andrea had lost track of time underground, it was now early morning. <br />
<br />
You were startled by the presence of many, MANY lizards outside... but they were engaging in an orgy or tearing each other apart for food or dominance... instead they were all lined up perfectly and orderly, beautifully organized in ringed. Their reptilian faces like those of the famous words &#39;music tames the savage beast.&#39; <br />
<br />
The song, it wasn&#39;t just mindless misses and snarls, it wasn&#39;t made with human sounds either... but you felt yourself at peace, calm, serene. Everything was going to be fine. <br />
<br />
Sitting in the center of the ring of lizard people was a female, a colorful crest around her neck, her body obviously not meant for fighting, having the weakest muscles of any lizard woman you&#39;ve seen... but that didn&#39;t matter, her voice was beautiful.  And you understood as you listened. She wasn&#39;t a &#39;queen&#39; or a &#39;ruler&#39; as humans understood it. She dictated no policies. She commanded no servitude. Her voice brought order to chaos. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t notice as you began to bulk up, growing larger and heavier, your scales thicker and harder, while Andrea became slimmer, and sleeker. A species had to adapt to survive. And survival was everything. Everything about a species was about this sacred, nature mandated goal. Everything felt so clear now. Everything made sense. Your intelligence, your reason, it was a gift, a gift to be shared with your new species. Her song. So beautiful. So calming. Your chaotic thoughts and wild instincts falling into order at her beautiful song. You had wanted to share this gift for the wrong reason. It wasn&#39;t to try and destroy your new species, it was to help them. To become greater. To share this trait for survival. <br />
<br />
Next to the female was a male albino lizard man, who was more lithe than any other you&#39;d seen. He stood next to her, a crest running from his head and down his back. He stood over her like a mouse trap ready to snap. <br />
<br />
As you continue to listen to her song, more and more you feel at peace, and at peace with yourself. What had been before, was before, you weren&#39;t human now, anything you remembered, was what was needed for the greater good of survival of your species. The female next to you understood this as well. You both had a duty to spread your traits. And you both had a duty to increase your numbers. It was not passion or lust, it was responsibility. If humans wanted to hold onto the planet so bad, they were going to have to show it. And your kind, was determined to prove it could survive it. <br />
<br />
Thoughts of atomic bombs filled your minds, the might of the sun brought to earth to sterilize anything the apes deemed a threat to their own survive. You felt no hate or fury at them, after all, they too were obeying the law of survival. But inside you, you could feel yourself evolving at these thoughts, same as when you saw the bullets killing one of your own kind and your hide began to slowly change. Resistance to radiation, an instinct to burrow and hibernate until the storm had passed. The scientists had no idea what they had created when they were trying to make subjects who could simply regrow limbs. <br />
<br />
You also noticed on the back of the songstress, wings, beautiful, and fully functional, by means you couldn&#39;t guess at, you knew the weight ratio should have been wrong, but you knew they&#39;d work just the same.  They weren&#39;t feathers, they were finely thin scales, evolved in a few hours in what should have taken millions of years and millions of generations. <br />
<br />
You and your female realize that you had begun to sing too, as were the rest of your kind, singing back to the songstress in a feedback loop, synchronizing your goals and motive, allowing your kind to work as a whole, rather than just a mindless horde. The mindlessness had been a weakness, and so unconsciously, she had evolved. You and your female felt any thoughts or desires to become human again melt away, never to return. The point of your intelligence wasn&#39;t to destroy your kind, it was to aid it in its survival. Your life before was just raw material for what awaited your kind. <br />
<br />
A human guard wearing headphones burst out of a small squat one room security building. He began taking shots at the songstress. You and Your Female didn&#39;t even hesitate as you both leaped and knock him down, your scales actually bouncing the bullets off. He began ranting and raving in his own language. You intentionally took the gun from him, and crushed it in your hands.  Murder wasn&#39;t your kind&#39;s way. <br />
<br />
You took off his head phones, and the guard too felt calm and at peace, and he stopped struggling. <br />
<br />
Another Female strutted over to you, her maternal material quiet large, a trait from your kind&#39;s mammalian past that you had inherited. <br />
<br />
She sang for you to let him go out. You and Your Female complied. The guard, at peace, merely stood, listening to the Songstress. Instead of violently violating him as had been the way of the mindless horde, Another Female took the human and brought his face close to her chest... and began to nurture him. And, he got smaller and smaller, blue scales covering his body and she began to lift him up as he became too small to stand on his own. His hair vanishing. And before your eyes, the guard was now an infant lizard child, sucking at its new mother&#39;s breasts. Another Female rocked him in her arms until he fell asleep. <br />
<br />
You KNEW before you would&#39;ve been horrified, you KNEW you&#39;d have been shocked before, you and Your Female... but now? Now you saw it for what it was: beautiful. You and Your Female knew you belonged. You sang.</p>
