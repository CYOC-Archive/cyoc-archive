<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No one was here.<br />
<br />
The TransDem agents had gone, the restored football team dispersed.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood in the hallway, Scott’s touch on his shoulder like a live wire going through his body.  Jeff exhaled a little grunt of surprise.  It nearly turned into a full-on pig grunt, but he held back – barely.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s breathing quickened.  He looked up into Scott’s eyes – those beautiful, sparkly blue eyes, Scott’s longish, wavy blonde hair a halo around his head.  Part angel, part football warrior, part boy-next-door, Scott looked at him with concern.  Jeff felt like he could lose himself in those eyes.  The jock’s tall, muscular body was so solid, so strong.  Jeff could see hints of Scott’s beautiful musculature even clothed, the way the various materials draped on his sexy form, curving around his body.  Jeff could faintly smell the mixture of natural musk and deodorant that he’d come to associate with Scott, and he wanted to bury his face in Scott’s armpits or crotch, just inhaling the scent of his once-lover deeply, fully losing himself in this strong, hairy jock.<br />
<br />
He was so caught off guard by this handsome man towering over him that he forgot what he was doing, even where he was – like his brain had seen something so beautiful it had to focus completely on this beauty, and lost track of all else.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, Jeffy,” Scotty asked him.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed Scott called him ‘Jeffy’ – like he did when they were together.  His ‘once-lover’… Jeff nearly swooned, his heart both enamored and broken at once.  He didn’t understand at all what was going on any more, he simply wanted to lose himself in that pig state he had found himself in only an hour ago, lost in cocks and hot men, oblivious to everything else.<br />
<br />
Scott’s hand was so big, so strong, so warm on Jeff’s shoulder.  He wanted it to caress his face, those strong muscular arms with bulging biceps to embrace his small body, holding him against those big, hairy pecs and cobblestone abs.  Jeff just wanted to bury himself in this behemoth god of a man, and live in the embrace of those powerful muscles and warm, hairy flesh forever, sheltered away from all of the pain and suffering of life.<br />
<br />
“Talk to me,” Scotty said earnestly, encouraging, so inviting.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Jeff became aware of the Chronivac display visible in his eyesight.  He noticed its lines and symbols.  It took him a moment to come out of his painful, transcendent reverie.  As he did, the lines became boxes and menus, the symbols letters and words.  Slowly his mind made sense of the Chronivac display, and he became aware once again of his surroundings and his thoughts.  He remembered he and Jeff had put the new Chronivac wrist units Willis had given them on their wrists, back in the locker room, as much as anything so they wouldn’t lose them.  Then he remembered the desperation that drove him now had pushed Jeff to access the Chronivac with the intent to use it, now that everyone was gone.  Now that Scotty, standing right before him, was gone in the way he most longed for and needed him to be there with him now.<br />
<br />
Scotty’s profile was open, superimposed unobtrusively in Jeff’s field of vision.  Nothing was changed, except where the open tab was – under the heading of FETISHES.  In it, he read the entry for a new fetish he had been entering before Scotty had stopped him:<br />
<br />
Subject: SCOTT ‘SCOTTY’ CAMERON HANSON<br />
Control Category: FETISHES<br />
Type of fetish: Sexual<br />
Nature: Compulsive<br />

HYBRID SPECIES DETAILS TAB<br />
Secondary Eroticized Goal: accrue other subjects with matching primary and secondary goals.<br />
Program Occurance Frequency: High<br />
Change Duration: Permanentk<br />
<br />
Jeff read the words, as if for the first time, though he had faint memories of creating the program in a rushed frenzy.  Seeing Scott watching him with concern, those words superimposed over his face, Jeff felt guilt, and a sense of shame overcame him.  He couldn’t believe he was going to use Scotty like this.  <br />
<br />
‘I should leave him out of it, just change myself in private,’ Jeff thought.  But he knew that wouldn’t satisfy him; one of the most erotic parts of the whole experience was that it was out of his control – Gomez had taken control of his body and changed him against his will.  It had been horrifying and yet nothing Jeff had ever experienced before had been so erotic as suddenly becoming that out-of-control, shameful, fat beast accepting every cock that entered a hole with pleasure.  It was like every private shame of Jeff&#39;s life had come together and become eroticized - and as much as he hated it, the power of it was undeniable; he had to get back to it again, to taste its forbidden pleasure.<br />
<br />
Even as he thought this, Jeff found himself at odds.  Doing it himself or even programming someone else to do it to him took a little of the eroticism out of it.  And yet he was so very desperate to relive the experience.  He had to do it, he had to try.<br />
<br />
‘No,’ Jeff thought to himself firmly.  Scott was his FRIEND, he couldn’t use him like a prop.<br />
<br />
‘But Scotty was your lover, and now just like that he’s decided he’s straight and done with you – put you away like an old, used jock strap… just friends?  How does that feel?’ the thoughts ran through his mind.  <br />
<br />
‘But if the roles were reversed and I was straight, you know Scotty would respect that even though it would hurt him,’ Jeff quietly answered the thought in his mind.  Then he thought to himself, ‘What am I saying?  I AM straight!’  <br />
<br />
The thoughts persisted, ‘Really?  Because you could have fooled me.’<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up at Scotty.  He was so handsome, it took Jeff’s breath away.  His internal voice faltered.  ‘I  was straight.  I remember I was, before the Chronivac.  I don’t understand what’s going on.’<br />
<br />
‘Yes, you were straight.  And when you were gay, and the Chronivac reverted you back to straight, you still loved Scotty and you were willing to be with him despite that.  You could still see his love, his beauty, you still valued it.  It seems when the roles were reversed, he wasn’t so into you as you thought.’<br />
<br />
The thought cut Jeff deep.  <br />
<br />
‘That’s not fair.  He thinks I’m straight now.  And I should be, but how I’m not I don’t understand.’  He felt so confused, his heart breaking inside.  He just wanted Scotty to hold him.  He wanted things to be how they were a day ago.  But Scotty decided he was straight now, and so now Jeff just wanted to be a fat tittied sow with a huge cock in every hole, all of his pain fucked away into oblivion.<br />
<br />
“Hey, buddy… can you hear me?” Scott asked gently, squeezing his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s heart broke anew at the gentle sweetness and simple caring in Scotty’s voice.  It was agony to be so close to him, and not to be able to touch him the way he used to, to embrace him – to make love to him the way they had before.  He decided in a moment of extreme frustration he couldn’t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
Jeff selected INITIATE and confirmed the changes, anticipating the fat, dumb, anthro big teated sow he would be at the hands of Scotty very shortly, pleasuring this angel before him in every way he longed to so desperately.<br />
<br />
Then the menus closed, and Jeff saw Scotty’s eyes refocus – no doubt the Chronivac was working.<br />
<br />
In that moment, the rational part of Jeff’s brain realized in horror the magnitude of what he had done, the betrayal of his closest friend.<br />
<br />
Regret overtook him.<br />
<br />
He had willingly hijacked Scott’s life, in service to his desires.  He got a sick feeling in his gut, knowing there was no way he would have time to undo this, as Scotty refocused on him.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized with what was most likely his final action as himself, that he probably deserved being a big, fat, dumb humiliated beast after all, who&#39;s sole purpose was to service and pleasure men in the most base way possible… , though most likely without all the pleasure of orgasm he would feel.  His world became shame as he realized what a disgrace his behavior was.  <br />
<br />
Jeff braced himself for the inevitable, taking comfort that at least he was getting what he deserved by being a stupid, obese, degraded sow… and very shortly, he would be lost in a very simple world of animal orgasm as he serviced men for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
This time he didn&#39;t hold back, and let out a loud, squealing OINK as he actually experienced a powerful, singular orgasm of anticipation, a wet spot quickly darkening the front of his shorts.</p>
