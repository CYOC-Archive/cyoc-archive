<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Steven McKnight was a bit surprised he actually received the text message. It had been such a stupid thing for him to do. Something he&#39;d thought he&#39;d never be caught dead doing. Even more so with another man. But he couldn&#39;t help it. The masculine presence of that man overtook him. It was like his body was acting on its own. His mind was filled with lust and body filled with desire. He couldn&#39;t stop himself even if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
But then to also receive the text... His body nearly jumped with joy. A smile planted on his face for the rest of the night. The other officers even took notice, mocking him for getting ready to go on a date. They badgered him about what lucky girl he&#39;d be taking out, but Steven didn&#39;t dare say who it actually was. A hint of embarrassment flooded through him despite knowing the other guys probably didn&#39;t care all that much.<br />
<br />
That embarrassment wasn&#39;t going to stop him though. He hadn&#39;t even bothered to change back into his civilian clothes before driving over to his date&#39;s house. It wasn&#39;t a long drive and knowing what happened earlier, a change of clothes was going to be happening anyways. He smiled a bit more as he felt his cock wake up a little more. Just running through what happened earlier that night seemed to get him a bit excited. <br />
<br />
He pulled up into the driveway, surprised to see something being delivered at the exact same time. Steven stepped out of his vehicle and approached the man, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize packages were allowed to be delivered this late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New policy. You order it, we deliver it,&quot; the delivery man said. &quot;Sign here.&quot; Without thinking, Steven grabbed his pen and signed his name. &quot;Thank you. Have a good night.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Steven was a bit stunned as he watched the other man leave. It wasn&#39;t until he was driving away that Steven realized what he&#39;d just done. &quot;Whatever...&quot; he rolled his eyes. It wasn&#39;t that bad of a crime. And it looked like he actually did just deliver something. Steven picked it up and then knocked on the door. He waited, but no response. He knocked again and tried the handle. Unlocked. &quot;Hello?&quot; he called out. &quot;Donny?&quot; he stepped inside. He could hear running water and walked towards it, setting the package on the dining room table. &quot;Donny?&quot; he called out again, walking deeper into the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;In here,&quot; Donovan called back. Steven opened the bathroom door. &quot;Sorry. I wanted to get a little cleaned up before. Just go relax. I ordered something for us tonight. Why don&#39;t you go open it up?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was almost a wink and a nod in Donovan&#39;s voice as he spoke. &quot;Sure,&quot; Steven replied. &quot;I signed for it. Hope that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should be,&quot; Donovan said. &quot;Just give me a few minutes and I&#39;ll be ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven stepped back out to the dining room table. He pulled out a key and opened up the box. But to his surprise, it was just a box of protein bars. &quot;Weird thing for tonight,&quot; he smirked as he pulled out the box. &quot;Build muscle fast!&quot; mocking the slogan on the box. However, Steven did feel his stomach grumble as he held the box. He&#39;d skipped dinner and had a pretty light lunch. &quot;He did say it was for tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
He opened the box and pulled out one of the wrapped bars. &quot;Chocolate and peanut butter. Pretty good combo,&quot; he said as he unwrapped and ate it. &quot;Not too bad,&quot; he muttered swallowing. However, his hunger persisted, so he grabbed another one. This time savoring it a bit more. As he chewed, Steven started to pull at his collar a bit. Suddenly it felt a bit tighter. Even stranger was how it was the same with the rest of his shirt.<br />
<br />
The sleeves started to grip against his arms. His shoulders no longer fit comfortably either. The same was with his pants. As he looked in the mirror his waist didn&#39;t seem any larger, yet they didn&#39;t quite fit right. It was like he was rapidly losing any extra space that he had in there. And with each passing second, less and less room was available. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Steven panted as he felt his chest straining against his shirt. It was getting so tight that he could barely even breath. He stumbled over to a mirror to see what was going on. However, what he saw wasn&#39;t him. It was him if he&#39;d gained almost 40 pounds of muscle. &quot;This isn&#39;t possible...&quot; he reached towards the reflection. His lean athletic build was building into something far larger. He looked absolutely stuffed inside the police officer uniform. Every big of it was clinging to his body. Just moving slightly and he could hear the blue fabric of his shirt start to tear. <br />
<br />
Steven used one of his massive hands to tear the fabric off his body. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; he groaned. Next he went for his pants. The leather belt he was wearing started to dig into his body. The pressure started to build against his hip bone. He quickly undid it. But his pants were quick to follow. Even a slight bend and they ripped down the seams. Two massive globes pushed out behind him but thick, defined quads filled his legs. Veins bulged out of each of the muscles, running down his legs. <br />
<br />
The black leather shoes he was wearing weren&#39;t any luckier as his feet outgrew their confines. The leather tore away from their soles. Steven&#39;s toes pushed out through the front and the rest of the leather was destroyed under the pressure. His socks and underwear were the only things to remain. Yet, they were currently stretched to their limits. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to me..?&quot; Steven wondered as he looked over his body. Running his hands over himself suddenly felt completely different. Every bit of his body was much more sensitive than it had been before. Just a simple touch and his mind went reeling. His dick throbbed with excitement. But looking in the mirror again, he felt a surge of fear run through him. Looking between his legs there was barely even a bump there.<br />
<br />
Steven had never thought of himself as very big in that department, but this was different. He knew he was hard. He knew his dick was pressing against his underwear. But he could barely even see it. And with his new massive body it looked even smaller. Steven had to see it. He went to strip off his underwear but when his hand gently brushing past it, his entire body went weak. A deep sensual moan escaped his mouth as he nearly fell into the mirror in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...&quot; he cried out as he tried to get ahold of himself again. It felt better than anything before. That small, little touch hung in his mind as he tried to stand back up. His body was still a bit jittery as he tried to control himself. However, two large arms wrapped around his wider shoulders. A bearded face rubbed into the nape of his neck giving him kisses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting without me?&quot; Donovan asked. His body towered over Steven&#39;s, squeezing it tightly. He was still a little damp from the shower. His salt and pepper hair clung to his defined muscles. And the towel he was wearing quickly dropped to the floor. His kisses continued as he felt the other man&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Steven melted in Donovan&#39;s arms. &quot;Don...&quot; he moaned. His mind and body wouldn&#39;t react any other way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there big guy,&quot; Donovan said. &quot;Enjoying your present?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmmm...&quot; Steven moaned. Donovan&#39;s hand had run down Steven&#39;s firm abs and into his overstretched underwear. He used a finger and thumb to massage Steven&#39;s cock. Anything more and Donovan&#39;s massive hands wouldn&#39;t really be able to actually hold onto it. But the small nub of a penis throbbed with joy. Pre dribbled out onto the floor. Every part of him that Donovan touched sent another wave of pleasure rushing through his body.<br />
<br />
Steven barely felt as Donovan&#39;s cock was shoved inside of him. The quick fluid motion pushed Steven against the wall. Before he knew it the other man was thrusting against him. His body moved in time with the other man. He couldn&#39;t help himself. Everything felt good. Everything felt fun. And before he knew it, it was over. His body fell limp in Donovan&#39;s arms. But he saw the mess he&#39;d made on the mirror in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll clean it up later,&quot; Donovan carried Steven to his room.</p>
