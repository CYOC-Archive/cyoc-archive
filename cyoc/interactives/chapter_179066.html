<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I hope you will all enjoy my chapter :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Raul buckled Andrew in the passenger seat and after ramming the key hard into the ignition, he starts the car up. Raul pushes his foot down and accelarates at high speed out of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wh-whoa... careful Raul,&#39; Aaron thinks to himself, &#39;I don&#39;t want to end up a wreck.&#39;<br />
<br />
Raul drives through the city, but careful not to be pulled over, after a while he turns to Andrew, seeing the 16 year old half asleep. &quot;Tell me Andrew,&quot; Raul says, laying a hand on the younger boy&#39;s leg. Raul might be underage for alcohole, but NOT underage to drive, since he is 18, &quot;how the hell could you afford such a beauty of a sportscar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... i-it was gifted to me... as a b-birthday present,&quot; Andrew says in a drunken tone, he has a hard time keeping his eyes open.<br />
<br />
Raul notices this, &quot;hey, get some rest,&quot; he says, &quot;I&#39;ll drive you home.&quot; Andrew did not need to be told twice, soon Aaron can hear his brother snoring.<br />
<br />
Raul smiles and strokes the younger boy&#39;s leg, Aaron is still confused, he had no idea that his brother was gay. He decided to keep it for himself, since it might be an effect of the alcohole his brother had drunk.<br />
<br />
As Raul drives in silence he starts to drift of into thoughts, &#39;damn... Andrew is so lucky to have such awsome parents,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I am 18 and I STILL have not gotten a car, I am so jealous.&#39; He looks over at Andrew, &#39;for some reason I can not believe his parents would gift their 16 year old son with a car, which is more suitable for a more experienced driver, like... ME,&#39; he continues to think. The more Raul thinks about how lucky Andrew is, the more jelous he becomes. &#39;I bet he actually borrowed it from a friend of his,&#39; he continues to think, &#39;yeah... that must be it.&#39; Raul starts to feel anger replace his jelousy, why? WHY!? Did everyone except HIM have such a great life?<br />
<br />
A beeping noise tears Raul from his train of thought, he looks at the dashboard and notices that the warning light for fuel is blinking. Raul groans, &#39;time to fill this beauty up,&#39; and he heads for the nearest gas station.<br />
<br />
Raul stops the car next to a free gasoline column and turns the engine off, sending Aaron into sleep mode, and gets out of the car. The young man then grabs a pipe and walks to the back of the car, he pops open the lid which hides the hole for gasoline and unscrews the cap. Raul pushes the nuzzle into the hole and Aaron can feel the gasoline start to flow into him, causing him to moan mentaly, feeling himself drifting deeper into sleep. He does not notice as Raul lies a hand on the roof of the cranberry red roof of the car, starting to stroke it in a loving way. &#39;I would love to have this car,&#39; the teen thinks to himself, &#39;this car is such a beast and head turner. I&#39;d get every girl in town with one of these.&#39; Raul continues to stroke the car, the more he stroke and admires it the more he wants it, the teen then grins as an idea pops into his head, &#39;sorry Andrew, but this car will soon be mine.&#39;<br />
<br />
After Raul had paid for the gas he drives Andrew home, as Raul turns into the driveway of Andrew&#39;s home he takes out his phone and, using the garage door codes he had extracted from Aaron, opens the garage doors and drives the car inside. Raul turns off the engine and pulls the key out of the ignition, Aaron is so tired that he falls asleep the moment his engine is shut off. Raul opens the door and steps out and closes the garage door with his phone, then he walks around to the passenger side and opens the door. &quot;Andrew, you&#39;re home,&quot; he says, shaking the 16 year old to wake him up as he unbuckles him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmnn... g-good dream...,&quot; the teen mumbles.<br />
<br />
Raul chuckles, &quot;here, I&#39;ll help you,&quot; he says. He helps Andrew get out of the car, by turning him so that both of his feet touch the ground, and pulling his arms, Raul manages to stand the drunken teen up. He wraps his left arm around Andrew to support him, while he closes the door and locks the car with his iPhone. Aaron enters lockdown mode and the alarm activates.<br />
<br />
The 18 year old helps Andrew into the house and into his bedroom. He lies the drunken boy into his bed and, after giving the boy a kiss on the cheeks, slips out of the room and quietly closes the door. Raul is about to head back down to the car to set his plan in motion as the phone suddenly rings. The teen quickly answers it, not wanting Andrew to wake from the noise, &quot;hello, this is Raul speaking,&quot; he says into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Raul, this is Andrew&#39;s and Aaron&#39;s mother,&quot; a female voice says on the other end, &quot;I just wanted to let the boys know that we&#39;ll be arriving tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Raul says, &quot;Andrew is asleep. I don&#39;t know where Aaron is, maybe he is staying with some friends for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like Aaron,&quot; the woman chuckles, &quot;please leave them a note so they know,&quot; she adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do,&quot; Raul says, he is about to end the call as he thinks of something, &quot;just a question: have you gifted Andrew with a sports car for his birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, why do you ask,&quot; the mother replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Andrew arrived at the beach club in a cranberry red sports car and said it was his,&quot; Raul says, &quot;I assumed it was not true, I believe he borrowed it from a friend. Anyway I got to get home, I know who the friend is, I&#39;ll get the car back to him. I left it in the parking lot by the beach club and drove Andrew home in mine,&quot; he lies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for doing that,&quot; the woman says, &quot;have a nice night,&quot; with that the phone call ends. Raul has a huge grin on his face, he sets the phone down and heads for the garage.<br />
<br />
Raul turns the garage lights on and unlocks the car with his phone and get in the driver&#39;s seat, the teen grins, &quot;time to make you mine, my beauty,&quot; he says. The teen puts the keys into the ignition and turns on the power, this awakens Aaron.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hu? Wh-what gives,&#39; he thinks to himself, his mind is still in sleep mode, so he does not register Raul sitting on his seat.<br />
<br />
Raul turns on the computer of the car and after opening a hacking app on his phone, plugs his phone into the USB-port of the computer, activating the program.<br />
<br />
Aaron suddenly feels weird, as if someone has stuck their hands into his brain, causing him to feel light headed and dizzy. He is unaware that Raul is hacking his system.<br />
<br />
After a while Raul&#39;s phone beeps and Raul grins, &#39;that was to easy,&#39; he thinks to himself. &quot;Now to pull up the registration and change the owner&#39;s name to mine,&quot; he mumbles. Raul pulls up the registration and looks at the name of the owner, &quot;hu? Andrew? Maybe he did not lie,&quot; he  mumbles, then he shruggs, &quot;whatever, it does not matter.&quot; The teen then deletes Andrew&#39;s name and replaces it with his, he also changes the adress to his and then confirms the new settings, smiling as the message &quot;edit successful.&quot; After his phone had reset the car&#39;s memory-linear, Raul unplugs it from the computer. The reset causes the computer clock to recalibrate to 15 minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
Aaron blinks, &#39;I feel st-strange,&#39; he thinks. He starts to run a diagnostic of his system, but can&#39;t seem to find the issue, &#39;I must be just tired,&#39; he thinks to himself. Aaron is about to fall asleep again when suddenly he is jolted awake by Raul starting the engine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay baby,&quot; he hears Raul say, &quot;let&#39;s get home, tomorrow is a big day for the both of us.&quot; Raul opens the garage doors and backs out of the garage, he uses his phone to close the garage doors and soon zooms off into the night.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wasn&#39;t I home,&#39; Aaron asks himself, thinking hard. The garage did not look familiar to him, so must have been a imagination. Aaron shrugs and lets Raul drive him &quot;home&quot;, feeling kind of confused but also excited for the next day.</p>
