<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your body was long and covered in black scales, and you had no limbs only a long tail that trailed behind you. In addition to your new female slit, you&#39;re new blader gave way and you found yourself pissing on the ground again. Your ears now were basically nonexistent, but you could still hear the sounds around you. Your nose could no longer smell, but your tongue now could smell naturally. Finally you had no teeth except two giant venomous fangs in your mouth. <br />
<br />
You looked around and saw the witch standing there and covering her eyes, and you were gigantic compared to her. Your body was nearly 200 yards long, or at least it seemed like it, and you were still twice her height when your head was to the ground. You still took attention to your slit, and felt a bit peeved over your new gender. You then looked over to the witch and hissed,&quot;What? You turned me into a snake! Why am I a girl? What purpose does my gender serve?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because, you were being incompetent earlier and I wanted to correct that. So as your punishment you are now and forever female, and you aren&#39;t a snake you&#39;re a basilisk.&quot; The witch said continuing to cover her eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;sss a basilisk? And why are you covering your eyes?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;A basilisk is a giant heavily armored serpant with the scale strength of a dragon. All basilisks have a gaze that is deadly, or in simpler words. Anything that you look in the eyes instantly dies, and just for fun I gave you deadly fangs with venom to add on. I don&#39;t expect you to use them effectively considering all you need to do is look at the enemy to kill them.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, doesn&#39;t that present us with an inconvenience?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I am working on an enchantment to supress this so that you are willing to control this willingly. Remember one thing though, if I die then so do you, but you won&#39;t have to worry about death anymore if I expire naturally. In other words you will become immortal, so use that as motivation to follow my commands.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case then I suppose I have no choice. But what is my name?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Dusk, simple but deep and fitting for a beautiful serpent bringer of death merely by looking at them.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t sound too bad, I&#39;ll adjust to it if you wish for me to. But I do have a serious question, how does that enchantment you were talking about work? I can&#39;t really comprehend how I can kill something simply by looking at them in the first place.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am very creative, and enchantments are my strength. No explanation is required you will know everything once you are embedded with the enchanted rune. Just close your eyes until I say for you to open them, and when you do make sure that you don&#39;t kill me.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish,&quot; you said closing your eyes,&quot;My eyes are now closed.&quot; <br />
<br />
You held your eyes shut, and you could hear the witch, and smell her approaching with your tongue. You felt her caressing your scales with her hands. &quot;You are a beautiful creature, your scales shimmer. You will feel a slight burning sensation, and then you will receive the knowledge of the rune. Just as a test though I have a prisoner that I&#39;d like you to deal with. Don&#39;t kill him with your glare immediately, I need to know if this worked of course. But after I confirm my enchantment has worked, kill him with your gaze to show that you can control your new ability. Now brace yourself for the burning.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
You suddenly felt a burning sensation on your head like someone was burning you with a match. Then the burning stopped and you felt the knowledge of the rune flow into your mind like instinct. To your surprise it was incredibly simple. &quot;Is it really that simple? I can just activate it whenever I wish?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, now open your eyes, and face the wall opposite to me.&quot; The witch said from your side, and you obeyed her looking over to see a colosseum looking entrance to your cave. The gates opened and out came a lone human man who was completely nude, unarmed, and defenseless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now do as I command and look at him without your deadly gaze.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
You did as the witch commanded and coiled yourself around the man blocking every way of escape for him. The man stood there and he locked eyes with you several times, and you smiled. &quot;It worked...now may I do what you said I could do?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
The witch levitated herself beside your head and saw you staring right at the man&#39;s eyes and he was looking back at you paralyzed in fear. The witch then nodded to you, and you closed your eyes for a moment and focused only on killing the man with your sight alone, and you saw his eyes suddenly go white and he fell to the ground lifeless. You blinked again and saw what you just did, and you were astonished. The enchantment allowed your sight to kill only those who you want dead, and it worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, now let me see your eyes with mine.&quot; The witch said and you lifted your head to face the witch on an even level. The witch then floated closer to you and looked into your eyes and said,&quot;Your eyes are beautiful, and it&#39;s definitely a rare sight for a being to look into the eyes of a basilisk like this. Especially since all creatures that do peak die immediately, and basilisk eyes are the most expensive potion ingredient for a reason, but not to worry yours will stay. Now enjoy your little human snack, it&#39;s your first of probably many.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
The witch then scratched your chin and you couldn&#39;t help opening your mouth and hissing playfully. &quot;Thank you, but one more question for now. Who are you?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a witch, my name is Talia, but you shall call me by the title of mistress. Now enjoy your snack, if you want I have more to spare.&quot; The witch, Talia said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the introduction then Mistress Talia, I will do as wish.&quot; You said, and looked at the man&#39;s corpse. You opened your jaw and swallowed the man whole, and you couldn&#39;t bite into him at all, but you still tasted the man as he slid down your throat. You then felt a small bulge in your stomach and you looked back to see a small lump where the man was being digested.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was interesting as my first experience devouring a being that I was once the same race as. I kind of liked it oddly enough, but is giving me human snacks the only method of torture you possess?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I transform them too, and now I can use you as a tool of intimidation. I mostly turn them into mice so you&#39;ll be perfect for that.&quot; Talia said<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, I&#39;m getting excited to see them for some reason. This feeling makes me feel hungry for some reason.&quot; You said licking your lips with your forked tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because your predatory instincts are being triggered and you are getting anxious. But don&#39;t be so drawn to tiny and meaningless mice when there are much larger rodents, and you can certainly swallow much larger creatures than that.&quot; Talia said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright then, I still wish to see the mice though.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Another time Dusk, but for now rest and let your meal digest. Goodnight for now, I promise that you will have more work you will enjoy tomorrow.&quot; Talia said snapping her fingers and all of the torches dimmed down, and she left the room. You then coiled yourself up and folded your head on top of your entire body, and fell asleep. You woke up to find...<br />
<br />
(Let&#39;s assume that Evil, and Bad in alignments are now separate depending on the situation.)</p>
