<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janice checked herself one last time on the toilet before she planned on going to sleep.<br />
<br />
Her clit had grown to awkward proportions, and looked as if to be merging with her urethra. A very small hole had opened up on the sensitive nub at least. Although the sensations were still similar, sensitive to the point it felt painful, overwhelming even, overall that area of her vagina had grown much duller than it used to be.<br />
<br />
She noticed how, at the place where the folds of her labia begun, the skin was red and stretched out painfully, something she couldn&#39;t seem to get rid of. Her clit had just engorged that much. Peeing had been more forwards than downwards this time. Instead of her urine splattering straight into the puddle of toilet water below her, it hit the bowl first, in two separate streams, from what she could see.<br />
<br />
She flushed, and bit her lip. She couldn&#39;t help but feel slightly guilty to her friends about saying nothing more than that her crotch was itchy, just like Mary&#39;s. Then again, if Mary too was that secretive about her mutation, she felt kind of relieved she didn&#39;t share too much of it in detail.<br />
<br />
Had it been a good idea to decide on a sleepover? She&#39;d rather have had the comfort of her mother being nearby, but from what she could hear from the other side of the phone, her mum almost sounded relieved. She too probably wanted some time and space for herself, she&#39;d gotten vaccinated as well after all. Would she look any different tomorrow? Or would the changes not develop that quickly?<br />
<br />
Janice grabbed a piece of toilet paper from the roll and wiped her vagina clean. She shivered for a moment. It just felt awkward having something that rough going over something that... yeah.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t looking forward to tomorrow, that was clear.<br />
<br />
Entering the bathroom to wash her hands, she found that, despite the door being open, it was occupied by her best friend, who was brushing her teeth with an automatic toothbrush in one hand. With her other hand she was desperately groping behind her, trying to scratch away the severe that had been haunting her through the day. She&#39;d talked about it before lunch, and then she, Janice and Emma went on with the day like usual, mostly tanning underneath the hot sun, and doing nothing else. Emma had the most beach-worthy body of them all. Janice was kind of jealous, but she couldn&#39;t stand the heat as long as the other two, so she went or stayed inside more often than them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I?&quot; Janice asked, as she kindly shoved Mary aside so she could wash her hands at the sink. Mary paid no heed to it and shrugged it off.<br />
<br />
Emma was already asleep, Janice saw, as she entered Mary&#39;s room. The three of them would be sleeping in here for the night. Mary&#39;s mom and dad had been open and caring about the her and Emma sleeping over, thinking it was for the best, considering the changes they were all going through.<br />
<br />
After the noises died down inside the bathroom, Mary too entered her bedroom, closed the door and dimmed the lights, then dove underneath her own covers. She and Janice shared a couple of whispers of goodnight, before tiredness overtook Janice, quicker than anticipated.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Janice&#39;s good night&#39;s sleep wasn&#39;t for long though.<br />
<br />
She woke up to the sound of the rustling of covers, and as she opened her eyes, saw the figure of Mary standing up from her bed again.<br />
<br />
Janice stretched, and discovered, to her displeasure, that her clit was engorged, and practically peeking through the fabric of her panties and pajamas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asked her best friend in a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; was the frustrated answer she got back. &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep because of the freaking itch. It only got worse. And then-&quot; Mary cursed. &quot;My period too. Sorry for waking you up like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I wake up your parents?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just- lie down. Nothing to worry about, just going out to wash my hands and get a- I&#39;ll handle it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry. I&#39;m here if you need me Mary.&quot; Her smile probably wasn&#39;t visible, but she hoped the message arrived well at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Jen.&quot; Mary whispered. &quot;G&#39;night.&quot;<br />
<br />
She silently opened the door, letting some of the light of the night lamp inside the hallway leak through the cracks. The door closed again with a dull thud, and Janice heard Mary tiptoe quickly towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She felt the at the front of her pajama bottoms, her hands feeling over her skin. Reaching her clit, she felt it had grown bigger, and also harder, for some reason. Her labia had split apart further, but there was a weird seam spreading from one outer lip, vertically over to the other. Was she growing skin over her clitoris.<br />
<br />
Letting her fingers explore slightly further, she felt the beginnings of what seemed to be some sort of hard shaft form at the beginnings of her labia. In a rush of fear, she felt underneath.<br />
<br />
She let out a shaky breath, feeling her pleasurable walls embrace the index finger she stuck into it. Her entrance was still there. She pulled her finger out of her slick snatch, and wiped it clean against the cover of her futon. Holding it underneath her nose, she found that she still smelled the same as always.<br />
<br />
Janice shut her eyes again, drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
That was, until she heard Mary scream.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s parents were awake, her mom with her in the bathroom, while her dad was calling the doctor, or a hospital. Emma and Janice were in the hallway looking through the open doorway into the bathroom, where a crying Mary was holding her crotch through her pajamas moaning in pain and hurt.<br />
<br />
From what Janice heard from Mary&#39;s panicked ramblings, she hadn&#39;t been able to sleep from the itch. What she hadn&#39;t mentioned before however, was that these itches had turned into burns, almost, and that these burns, paired with the start of her period, caused for more trouble than it had been worth.<br />
<br />
After rushing into the bathroom on her own. Mary made an attempt to solve at least one of two problems she had, the one she could solve, by inserting a tampon inside her birth canal, to stop the monthly flow. It resulted however, in her groin area growing ten times more painful, to the point that she had to scream it out.<br />
<br />
And there they were, Emma and Janice. Unable to help, tired, but also scared out of their minds for what had just happened to their friend. Emma called her own parents awake, Janice did the same with her mom.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
The message Janice got from Mary&#39;s mother was comforting.<br />
<br />
&#39;She&#39;s in the hospital. The pain has dissipated, she&#39;s (almost) perfectly fine again.&#39;<br />
<br />
She knew Janice was still awake. Janice was now back in her own bed again, but she wanted to make sure Mary was alright.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s mom shared a file with her. She opened it.<br />
<br />
It showed a picture of Mary in a hospital bed, smiling weakly at the camera. Her eyes were still teary, but she no longer seemed to be in as much pain as she did when the clock struck one that night.<br />
<br />
&#39;Best wishes from me, xxx&#39;, she sent back. Then she put her phone down and tried to, <i>finally</i> get some sleep.</p>
