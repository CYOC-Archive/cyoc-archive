<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> By the time Ferin woke again later in the afternoon he was feeling much more himself. He could still see the ambush when he closed his eyes, but it didn&#39;t make him want to cringe away and hide again. Toreg was gone but Tell remained behind, and thankfully didn&#39;t comment on Ferin&#39;s outburst, for which he was grateful.<br />
<br />
Sitting on a stool near his bed was some folded up cloth, and leaning against the stool was his boots, which looked freshly polished. A questioning look towards the otter was all that was needed to get the excitable beastman to volunteer the answer without Ferin even asking. &quot;Your clothes were kind of ruined, but you look like you might fit some of mine. The Elders took your sword and armor though, they&#39;ll return it later, they just want to be sure you&#39;re not a threat.&quot; Tell grinned at that, despite not knowing Ferin, the otter obviously thought that unlikely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ferin murmured as he picked up the folded bit of blue cloth, examining it, then looking over to Tell. The only garment the otter wore was that green loincloth, and if Ferin didn&#39;t miss his guess. this was the same thing in a soft shade of blue. There was a sleeveless vest sitting on the stool as well, so maybe something for trips outside of the hut, or the village. He looked at the loincloth again, then at his arm still in a sling. &quot;Can I get some help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell tilted his head curiously, then looked at Ferin&#39;s arm, his small round ears vibrating for a moment in what looked like a sign of embarrassment. &quot;Oh! Right. Sorry.&quot; He scrambled off his stool by the fire and started over, halting for a moment as Ferin stood up, letting the blanket slip free of him. He could almost feel the otter&#39;s gaze on him, those watery blue eyes scanning his body before he took the cloth in webbed hands.<br />
<br />
Ferin lived in barracks, it had been awkward at first but he was used to being undressed around others, the otter, despite his skimpy garments seemed a bit flustered an out of sorts by the whole situation, and actually took a couple tries to get the garment fitted around Ferin&#39;s waist. Next he helped with the boots, and finally the vest, which did fit Ferin rather well, even if he was a little broader in the chest and shoulders than Tell, they were of a relative size, but that did leave a bit of a gap in the front under the ties for the white fur on his chest to stick through.<br />
<br />
Tell&#39;s webbed paws lingered on those ties for a moment, seemingly wanting to touch that patch of fur. Finally, he snatched his hands away and grinned at Ferin. &quot;You know, white&#39;s considered lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what it is?&quot; Ferin asked, following Tell back to the fire pit in the middle of the house, sitting on one of the stool as he watched the otter going back to preparing the evening meal. This stew smelled of fish and herbs, unlike the red meat one from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hair.&quot; Tell said, sounding dodgy and not meeting Ferin&#39;s eyes. He looked up and must have seen something on his face because he sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Pa made me promise not to say anything until the elders can talk with you. I don&#39;t know much, but..&quot;<br />
<br />
Ferin held up his hand to forestall the otter. &quot;Then best you don&#39;t say anything.&quot; Tell sighed in relief, obviously torn between he desire to be friendly and helpful and his promise. &quot;Can you at least tell me where we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit.&quot; The otter admitted as he stirred the pot. &quot;This is a new outpost for our tribe, near the borders of our lands. You came stumbling across it, that stone you found is one of our, um, shrines I guess you&#39;d call it. We&#39;re only a few miles from there. Pa and I were out foraging for supplies when we found you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds kind of like where I grew up. This almost looks like my parents&#39; home.&quot; Ferin mused as he looked around, though soon he was leaning forward and sniffing the stew.<br />
<br />
He must have looked hungry as the otter handed him a bit of flat bread, which he gratefully tore into. &quot;Aren&#39;t you a royal guardsman? Live in a big city or a castle?&quot; Tell asked, head canted to the side in a gesture Ferin was quickly learning meant curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I do. I grew up in a small village. My dad was a hunter. I joined the guard when I turned sixteen, though, been with them for five years now.&quot; Ferin ripped off another piece of flat bread to munch on, his stomach grumbling now for the fish stew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a year older than me.&quot; The otter mused, sounding pleased. &quot;Didn&#39;t want to follow in your dad&#39;s footsteps?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. I did.. I just.&quot; Ferin shook his head. &quot;Things happened.&quot; He finished off his flatbread and his stomach made another rumble. &quot;Maybe I should go for a walk, clear my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell opened his mouth, but a gruff voice came from the door to the hut. &quot;Not alone. Sorry. You have to be accompanied for now.&quot; Toreg stated as he pushed his way into the hut, dropping a sack of something in the part of their home that served as their pantry. &quot;Go with him Tell, I&#39;ll keep an eye on dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell practically bounded to his feet, looking eager. Though the otter always seemed eager. Ferin grinned and followed a bit slower. Even if the pain was dull, he still felt oddly stiff. It felt good to move though, and stepping out of the hut was like stepping back in time for him. It really was like his home village, a small cluster of huts in the middle of the woods, the air fresh and crisp. The sounds of nature mixing with the sounds of people at work. Even if those people weren&#39;t human.<br />
<br />
Tell seemed content to just walk at his side, letting Ferin pick which way to wander. Occasionally pointing out different buildings, like the large hut the elders used as their meeting hall, or the herbalist&#39;s hut, or even the smithy, though that one was obvious. Ferin suddenly realized he had missed this. The simple, rustic life. He could almost feel like he was back home and the last few years had never happened.<br />
<br />
At least until he came up to an alley, and a human shot out from between the two huts, moving right into his path, a pair of rabbit ears on his head quivering with either anger or annoyance. He stopped short as he saw the human&#39;s face though. &quot;Prince Elim.&quot; He knew he sounded shocked, but years of drilled instinct kicked in and he snapped to attention. Tell just looked curious. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you survived, your highness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ferin wasn&#39;t sure how he actually felt, and braced himself for one of the prince&#39;s famous outbursts.</p>
