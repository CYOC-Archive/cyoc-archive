<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'You know,' Julio commented, 'If the others are killed, with the exception of your Akira, it <br />
just means a change of clothes. But if Tamthis turns them into more happily little love <br />
puppets, then this place will no longer be safe.'<br />
<br />
&quot;They're my sisters, brother, whatever, they'll win. Besides, I doubt what they are now can <br />
be transmuted into loyal toys this time.&quot; <br />
<br />
'That might be true of the angel brigade, and they might go down fighting, but your <br />
brother isn't.' <br />
<br />
&quot;He's a kitesune.&quot; <br />
<br />
'And Tamthis is more powerful than him by light-years. And then there's the fact that even <br />
if Tamthis doesn't transmute any of them and comes here calling for us, this place might <br />
still be in the blast radius of those genies, without Jasmine to tell them what NOT to blow <br />
up, Mecca could end up glass.'<br />
<br />
&quot;What do giant robots have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Ugh. Mecca, not Mecha, it's the holy land of, oh never mind, I'm just saying we should <br />
vacate.'<br />
<br />
Keiko thought for a moment, &quot;You have anywhere in mind in particular?&quot; <br />
<br />
'Do you?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Maybe, maybe not, hard to tell... did you just feel that?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Yes. It's started.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope Akira/Anna doesn't get killed.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Wish you there?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least. Don't take me wrong, those are my sisters who are fighting and dying <br />
out there right now, but I also know that in a high stakes super battle on that scale it's <br />
best that I stay out of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
'You don't think you can contribute just cause you can't blow stuff up?'<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not at all. I'm just not a fighter, I'm a trickster, it's how I was remade, and I wasn't a <br />
martial artist or soldier before Karther kidnapped me and turned me into his toy anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Ah. I see. Still my original point still stands, I believe we should vacate.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mean -you- vacate and I come along because you're stuck with me until you <br />
undo that tick transformation I put on you?&quot; <br />
<br />
'I know better than most that mixing magics only leads to disasters, but there are more <br />
bags of tricks in this world than science and magic and I know a couple of those too.'<br />
<br />
&quot;How convenient for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
'What do you expect? I'm just in this, and anything, for the knowledge. I don't like the idea <br />
of Tamthis taking over the desert landscape and the genies blowing it up even less, but if <br />
I've been taught anything from being alive as long as I have it's how to -move-on-!' <br />
<br />
&quot;What if I just stayed here and play solitaire?&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'd be bound to our agreement to remain this form until your friends won or lost.'<br />
<br />
&quot;My -family- won or lost. And thank you, how surprisingly honorable of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I take offense to that. I seek the universe's ultimate programming guide, not the cheat <br />
book.' <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on?&quot; Kathy asked scared and confused, &quot;What are you all doing-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer, the singular shiva vixen in the harm room, stood dumbfounded for a milisecond <br />
before Tamthis' programming shifted the four sister from honor guests to targets. She <br />
ignored Alexandra since she hadn't changed in a burst of light into a full armored fox <br />
woman with only one tail and a pair of wings. <br />
<br />
Alexandra calmly approached Kathy, the kitesune fell on a collection of soft pillows and <br />
began skirting away from the slowing approaching one. A blast of sand rock sent tiny <br />
pieces into Alexandra's flesh, she ignored them but tore off her face veil all the same, if <br />
everyone else was done hiding then so was she.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Alexandra?&quot; Kathy asked her mind not comprehending this in the least.<br />
<br />
Alexandra started, &quot;You know me?&quot; A tiny part of her dared to hope. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, of course I do! You were supposed to become part of my Tamthis' harem with me, <br />
weren't you? Why are you doing this? I've been wanting so badly for you to come back to <br />
us, but not like this... Alexandra please tell me why?!&quot; <br />
<br />
'This thing, she, knows me?' Alexandra thought. She merely stared at the kitesune who <br />
cowered before her, before the absolute insanity her perfect little world had exploded into. <br />
One part of Alexandra wanted everything related to Tamthis wiped from the face of <br />
creation, including his creations, it was only right. But... &quot;We are here to kill Tamthis.&quot; She <br />
said plainly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kathy pepped out. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are here to kill Tamthis.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra... HOW CAN YOU? He's our king! Your king! My king-!!&quot;  'This is all just a bad <br />
dream! Bad, bad, bad, bad! I'll wake up! Yes! Wake up! Wake up!' <br />
<br />
&quot;My king is dead. And soon so shall yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MONSTER! MURDERER!&quot; Kathy screamed as she proceeded to try and claw Alexandra's <br />
eyes out.  Alexandra wasn't a weak harem thing, she had been a laborer, an overseer, a <br />
thinker, a doer in her master's house, just one among many, but one who worked hard. <br />
She took hold of Kathy's paws, nearly crushing them. Not giving it a second thought she <br />
head butted Kathy, it was enough to render the fragile and dainty thing unconscious. <br />
Alexandra let go of her paws and let her hit the floor of the room. 'Stupid. I should just kill <br />
this but... why does it keep coming back to but? That look in her eyes.. does she love that <br />
killer? Of course she does, it's what she was made to do. But then...' Alexandra looked out <br />
a window at the flawless orderly city, some fled from the havoc heard in the palace, others <br />
simply carried on doing what they were doing, as they had been made to do.  'But then <br />
what am I?' <br />
<br />
At the city walls, Lucy's ears perked up. She felt it. It felt like her sisters, and yet did not, <br />
however one feeling screamed out from all the others 'threat.' Her body turning to a hot <br />
desert wind she tore above the city towards the palace. <br />
<br />
Natalie prowling the city too stopped, sniffed the air, and howled, her all male pack <br />
howled with her. Their master was in danger. Nothing else mattered as they tore through <br />
the streets and kitesune alike as the wolves raced to protect their master. <br />
<br />
What was for a moment a contained skirmish in the palace, was quickly turning into an all <br />
out battle. Four angels against one multiple armed vixen, it was hardly a fight. In the mean <br />
time of Alexandra and Kathy's drama, Jennifer had attacked relentless and ruthlessly. It <br />
seemed that Tamthis had learned from Karther's mistakes and had rendered Jennifer <br />
unable to go under from electric shock from an electric gauntlet or pass out from pain by <br />
a non-leathal laser.  The end result had been sad but predictable as Jennifer lay on the <br />
harm floor all four of her arms severed and her legs broken, it was the only way she'd <br />
stop fighting. Lisa without a moment's hesitation began the slow process of healing the <br />
armless vixen's injuries to keep her from dying of blood loss. Then she applied her cross <br />
to Jennifer's forehead to undo the former human male's brainwashing. Sadly, this wasn't <br />
quite like Karther's brainwashing and was mixed with the insanity that Karther had <br />
trapped in his castle walls. It took more than just a quick motion to for the combat <br />
oriented messenger to restore the vixen's original mind and free will, and hearing the <br />
crashing of walls behind her and the feeling of a hot desert wind, as her three sisters <br />
formed a protective circle around her, she knew that more than a moment could be very <br />
well too much to ask for. <br />
<br />
Jasmine let out mad battle cries as she gleefully cut down the horrible arab stereotypes <br />
clothed as fennec kitesune, however the shiva wolf, Roberta, blocked her first strike, then <br />
her second, then her third, then Jasmine retreated back four point two feet to avoid the <br />
blade of the wolf's weapon.   Even as Amir Tamthis stood to engage Kyriel who felt <br />
strangely familiar to him in more ways than one, he poured power into Roberta to put her <br />
on par at least in part with the senior messenger, so Amir Tamthis would not have to deal <br />
with two of the messengers at once. <br />
<br />
Kyriel thought, 'My first fight in my life, and I'm going up against what used to be the <br />
person who almost ate the soul of one of my parents. Great. And since he's an innocent <br />
victim and my other parent's best friend in there buried under Tammia,  buried under a <br />
wolf beast, buried under Tammy, I can't risk killing him. Yep!' She thought with pure sarcasm that neither Jake or Tabra had, 'What a wonderful way to start out life... here's <br />
hoping it doesn't get cut short!' <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here to save you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need to be saved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're screwed in the head, you don't get to say so!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think more clearly than anyone here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I disagree.&quot;</p>
