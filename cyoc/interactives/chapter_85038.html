<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kira lay shivering against my side, eyes closed, beaded sweat drying on her skin in the warm sunshine.  I wished we were both clean and was relieved to feel the damp spots on my hips disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, that&#39;s one handy ring alright.&quot; Kira murmured without opening her eyes. &quot;Can it bring us a blanket or something?  I don&#39;t mind fantastic sex on the sidewalk, but something softer to lay on would be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a sec.&quot; I said, and wished we were lying on the couch in my apartment.  Kira let out a startled &quot;Eeep!&quot; as we sank into the cushions.  It took a little while for her to catch her breath as she looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;This works too, I guess.  Where are we, your parents&#39; basement?&quot; Kira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it&#39;s an efficiency apartment; independent living for one.&quot;<br />
<br />
She squinted as she peered around before returning her cheek to my shoulder and closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger than my dorm room, and no underwear strewn across the floor or stacks of empty pizza boxes.&quot;  She ran her hand across my chest and down to cup my cock and balls. &quot;You do want to use this with me, right?  I mean, getting fisted by my boyfriend felt pretty awesome, but, like, this thing works, right?&quot; She shook my junk for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it works, I just wasn&#39;t comfortable whipping it out on the street back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ought to try going naked!  At first it&#39;s like, OMG everyone is staring at me!  Then after a while you get like, &#39;Aw-yeah, everyone&#39;s checking me out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d enjoy that.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya never know until you try it, but I won&#39;t push you.&quot; She frowned. &quot;I was gonna say going naked with me would make sex easier, but you don&#39;t seem very interested in that.  And you&#39;re certainly no slouch in the &#39;getting Kira off&#39; department either, so I guess I can&#39;t complain too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said I wasn&#39;t interested!  I just wanted to use protection, then you were doing a sock puppet impression and it was all I could do to avoid a broken arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Whine whine, sexy big-titty girlfriend wants to jump my bone and I&#39;m too busy diddling her to whip it out.&#39; She paused.  &quot;I did like the breast-feeding though.  Are they gonna fill up again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it was a one time thing,&quot; I said, &quot;but I can do it again if you want.&quot; I reached up and brushed my fingertip across the swell of her breast. Kira shivered and squeezed my junk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fair!  I think you&#39;re using your ring to make me super-horny when you touch my tits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to stop touching you?&quot;  I asked, running a finger around her nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, but I don&#39;t want to turn into some braindead fuck-bunny each time you cop a feel either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humph, didja stop to think that after a bunch of orgasms you&#39;ve got so many hormones pumping through you I don&#39;t need to use my ring to turn you on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh!  Logic has no place in this discussion, the real question is why you&#39;re still wearing pants when we&#39;ve been in private at your place for at least two minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought women enjoyed savoring the afterglow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do after getting fucked, which, all those orgasms aside, you haven&#39;t done yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kira, what&#39;s really bothering you?&quot;  I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, why me?  You can make  people give you money, blink yourself home in the wink of an eye, and change a girl&#39;s body to look however you want, so why me?  Just &#39;cause I was naked and you liked what you saw?&quot;<br />
<br />
I did some very fast thinking before I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first maybe it was superficial, you are really hot after all, but the more time we spend together, the better I want to know you!  You&#39;re amazing, funny, quirky, and so self-confident if I didn&#39;t have this ring I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to hold my own with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, do you pinky swear you&#39;re really interested in me?  That you won&#39;t just blink me back to my campus and I&#39;ll never see you again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear.&quot; I said, wrapping my pinky around hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now that&#39;s settled, can you do anything about the scratches on my knees?  And I vote we avoid sidewalk sex in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick wish and we were both whole and healthy.  I hadn&#39;t realized I was hurting from Kira&#39;s love-bites until they healed.  Kira sighed and continued lightly squeezing my junk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No roommates huh?  That must be nice.  Even with the nudism I can&#39;t get a single dorm room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe the college lets you do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  I pay my tuition, or Paps does anyway, and I dress for classes and lunch and stuff.&quot;  She put her lips against my ear and whispered. &quot;Did you think I never wore clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her squeezing was having predictable results and my growing erection was becoming painfully tangled in my underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like me to?&quot; she continued whispering. &quot;I would, for the right guy.&quot;  She nibbled on my earlobe. &quot;Are you Mr Right, Daniel?&quot; She stopped squeezing and forced her hand under the waistband of my pants, wrapping her fingers around my growing chubb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might get chilly, in a couple months.&quot; I replied.  My heart was beating fast and I was hot all over.  Kira started squeezing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like this?  I hope you do, I intend to help you cum for every time you&#39;ve made me cum.&quot; She licked my ear lightly. &quot;That&#39;s an awful lot of cumming, you might not get much sleep tonight.&quot; The tip of my penis was sticking out of my underwear and rubbing against her wrist as she began jerking me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kira, I thought you wanted that, inside you?&quot; I was nearly panting, it felt like the air in my lungs was on fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh baby, you know I do!  But I refuse to beg.  If you want to put it in me, all you have to do is ask.&quot;  She nibbled on my earlobe some more and used her wrist to roll my erection from side to side as she jerked me. I could smell how aroused she was, wet and ready, but not grinding herself against me like before.  I pulled my ear away and turned to face her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kira, super-sexy big-titty girlfriend of mine, may I have the pleasure, the honor, and the exquisite joy of having sex with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two big tears rolled down Kira&#39;s cheeks and she sniffled. &quot;That&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve called me your girlfriend.&quot;  Kira lunged forward, kissing me hungrily even as she continued weeping.  She got her hand out of my pants and wrapped her arms around me, I did the same and pulled her close.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I wasn&#39;t sure, with all the power that ring gives you, even after your pinky swear, that you&#39;d...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;d what?  Respect you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;d ask.  I mean hell, I&#39;m so horny I stink, it&#39;s not like I&#39;d say &#39;no&#39; if you started anything, but, but you still asked.&quot;  She took a deep shuddering breath.  &quot;That means a lot to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I may cop a feel now and then, or steal kisses, but I promise, anything involving you and my cock, I&#39;ll ask permission first.&quot;  I rubbed my hands up and down her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to ask permission too?&quot;  She asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no!  That hand job you started was amazing!  Just be discreet okay?  I&#39;m not as brave as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kira started laughing and pulled me to lie on on top of her, wrapping her legs around mine to hold me in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, so I can do whatever I want with you, and you can do whatever you want to me, as long as it doesn&#39;t involve your Johnson, but you can also /make/ me do things thanks to your ring.  That about sum things up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, yeah, I guess so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how about you blink your clothes into that hamper over there and we GET ON WITH IT!&quot; she shouted, shaking me by the shoulders.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later and my clothes were gone, leaving Kira warm, wet, and insistent beneath me.  Condoms were the furthest thing from my mind.</p>
