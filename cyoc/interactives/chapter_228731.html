<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unbeknownst to me, my roommate had been through a similar transformation. He was now an anthropomorphic husky as well, but his mind had been altered. He thought that he had always been this way. He didn&#39;t remember being human, didn&#39;t remember living with me as my roommate.<br />
<br />
I heard a noise, and turned to the doorway. There stood my roommate, looking more confident than I&#39;d ever seen him. He was now an anthropomorphic husky as well, but his fur was pure white, and his eyes seemed to hold a newfound mischief. He stepped forward, and in the most seductive voice I&#39;d ever heard, he said my name. I felt a shiver run down my spine.<br />
<br />
He climbed into bed with me, settling in behind me. His fur was soft and fluffy against my back, and I could smell his musky scent. He wrapped his arms around me, pulling me close, and nuzzled his muzzle into my neck. His tail began to wag slowly, thumping against the mattress in time with his heartbeat.<br />
<br />
I tried to pull away, but he held me tighter, his grip firm yet gentle. His breath was warm against my ear as he whispered words of affection and desire. “David what-ARF you doing?”<br />
<br />
He let out a soft chuckle, the sound vibrating against my skin. &quot;I&#39;m just showing you how much I care, my little pup. You&#39;re so beautiful, and I want you to know that I&#39;m here for you, no matter what.&quot; His words sent a shiver down my spine. Your roommate wouldn’t do this. The change did something to his mind, made him someone else… Then your heart skipped a beat when you realize. In this reality you must be his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
I tried to respond, to say something, but the words got caught in my throat. He misunderstood my silence, thinking it was shyness. He nuzzled closer, pressing his body against mine, and his erection pressed against my tail. I couldn&#39;t help but feel a strange mixture of fear, and confusion.<br />
<br />
He pulled back slightly, his breath hot on my face. &quot;You know you want this, baby. You&#39;ve always wanted this. Just let go and give in to your animal instincts.&quot; His words sent a chill through me, and I could feel my body beginning to respond. My nipples hardened, and I could feel the wetness between my legs growing.<br />
<br />
He leaned in closer, his lips pressing against mine. The kiss was gentle at first, but then he deepened it, his tongue slipping past my lips and exploring my mouth. I involuntarily moaned into the kiss, feeling my body go limp with pleasure against my will. My animal instincts are taking over, and I desperately try to fight them, but my body is acting on its own. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my breath coming in short gasps.<br />
<br />
He breaks the kiss, and trails hot, wet kisses down my neck. His teeth scrape against my sensitive skin, sending shivers of pleasure through me. &quot;That&#39;s it, baby. Let go. Give in to your desires.&quot; He reaches between my legs, parting my fur and pressing two fingers against my swollen, aching clit. I cry out, arching my back in response to the pleasure that surges through me.<br />
<br />
His touch is expert, knowing just how to make me feel good. He thrusts his fingers in and out of me, curling them against my G-spot, and I can feel myself growing closer and closer to orgasm. My hips buck against his hand, and he goes faster, harder. I try to stop, but the musk is too strong and my body continues. The sensations are too overwhelming, and my body can&#39;t help but want more no matter how hard I try to stop it.<br />
<br />
He pulls back, and I feel his hot breath on my ear. &quot;Tell me what you want, baby. Tell me you want it.&quot; I&#39;m too lost in the moment to think clearly, so I just moan in desperation, begging for it to stop. He chuckles, a low, satisfied sound that sends a shiver down my spine. Suddenly, he positions himself between my legs and pushes forward, guiding his erection to my entrance.<br />
<br />
I tense up at the sensation of being penetrated, but he&#39;s gentle, easing himself into me inch by agonizing inch. Finally, he&#39;s buried to the hilt, and I feel him still inside me. He holds himself there, his breathing ragged, and looks down at me with an expression that&#39;s equal parts lust and possessiveness. Then, with a powerful thrust, he pushes all the way in, filling me completely.<br />
<br />
I cry out, feeling overwhelmed by the fullness and the intimacy of the moment. My body arches against his, and he begins to move, his hips meeting mine in a rhythmic dance. I can feel every inch of him inside me, and the sensation is so intense it&#39;s almost painful. My nails dig into his shoulders as he thrusts harder, deeper, claiming me with each stroke.<br />
<br />
His lips find mine again, and he kisses me with a hunger and forces his tongue inside my mouth again. I can feel my own claws scratching at his back, leaving long, red lines in his fur. I desperately try and say something, but all that come out are moans and yips. The instincts are in control now.<br />
<br />
I can feel myself getting closer and closer, the orgasm building inside me like a wave about to crash. I moan into his mouth in a desperate plea, and he responds with a growl. His thrusts become more urgent, more desperate, as he races toward his own release.<br />
<br />
With a final, powerful thrust, he comes inside me, his body tensing as he releases his seed. I feel it spill deep inside me, and my own orgasm crashes over me in a wave of intense pleasure. My muscles tense and spasm, and my body convulses around him.<br />
<br />
For what feels like an eternity, we&#39;re locked together by his canine knot, breathing heavily, our hearts racing. Finally, he pulls out of me, rolling to the side and collapsing on the bed, spent. I lie there, panting, my heart still racing, trying to catch my breath and process what just happened. My mind feels fuzzy, and I can still feel the weight of his body pressed against mine.</p>
