<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When his father left his son’s room to watch the game, Jeff sighed to himself and was glad he didn’t find out about the Chronivac.  Sometimes he gets sick and tired of his father barging in and wondering what he was up to.  Sometimes, he wish that his father would mellow out, that he wouldn’t have to worry about work, or family, or anything a middle age man would do.  Maybe if he were a young child, he wouldn’t have to worry about everything.  He would be a carefree kid who would look up to his older siblings and follow their advice.  He would love to see his father live that simpler life. <br />
<br />
That’s when something hit Jeff.  He has the Chronivac in his possession and this program the turn anyone and anything into what he wanted.  So if he could turn his dad into a younger brother, then it would actually happen.  Hell, he could even leave him as a child for a week just to teach him a little something about role modeling.  Looking at the Chronivac, he nodded and was ready to turn his father into a child.<br />
<br />
He started to look at his options and spotted the Age Transformation package.  When he clicked on it, he looked through his options and could tell it looks a little complex.  For one, they were asking him for the name of the person he wishes to change.  So he started to type his father’s full name, which was Jonathan Obritch Taylor.  The next thing he looked at was what number does he want his target to age or regress.  Jeff thought about it and wondered which age does he want his father to be.  There were many choices that he wants his father to be, sometimes a preteen, a kid, even a child.  But then he came up with the perfect age for him.  The age of three.  The reason why his wanted his father to be a 3-year-old late toddler is that toddler’s are easy to control.  They can even look up to their older siblings and copy what they do.  And he does have his own siblings that’s for sure.  Since Jeff’s sister is ten and his older brother is 22 and in college, that makes him the middle child.  But if he makes his father younger then all three of them, he will be looking up to Jeff and follow in his footsteps.  It would be perfect.  So he clicked on the text box and typed in the number 3 for his father’s future age.<br />
<br />
Next thing he saw was a yes or no question that says, ‘Mental Change’.  Jeff thought about it and guess that if the program wants his father to be regressed mentally as well.  As he was thinking about it, he knew that his father would freak out if his body regressed.  So he clicked on the check box marked yes and moved on to the next question.  The next yes or no question was if he would allow reality to change with his father.  That means if his father regressed to three, then reality would change all around him and no one will notice any of it, with the acceptation of the person who is using the program.  Though his father’s body and mind would regress, if his family saw him like that, they would possibly freak out.  So he was on the check box and clicked on yes to prevent that from ever happening.<br />
<br />
When he went to the last questions, Jeff read them fully.  One of the questions stated that the duration of the regression.  That one was a difficult one to pick.  He doesn’t want to make it too soon cause he wants to see his father regress in stages.  And he sure as hell doesn’t want to do it too long because it would take forever.  So he has to think of something that was just right for him and his father.  So he decided to type in ninety minutes because the change will flow easily.  Then the last question is low long the transformation will last.  That would mean how long that person changed would remain in that form.  Sometimes it would be a week, sometimes a month, sometimes and year, or it will be forever.  Giving this a little thought, Jeff decided to keep his dad at three for a week.  This will give him the time to get use to his father at that age.  So he went to the text box and typed down ‘One week’.  And who knows, maybe he could change that in the near future.<br />
<br />
After putting all of that information down, he did a quick review of the change.  So far, nothing he need to fix before executing the change on his father.  Nodding his head in approval, he moved the mouse cursor to the ‘Execute’ button and clicked on it.  Upon doing that, a warning message appeared, telling him if he wants to do this.  Looking at this, he smiled and thought that was funny.  So he clicked on ‘yes’ and the window disappeared as well.  When the window vanished, a timer appeared counting down to an hour.  Knowing it has started, Jeff decided it was time to see if his dad starts to regress.  So he left his room and headed back to where his father is located.<br />
<br />
When the transformation started, Jeff’s father was sitting on the sofa in the family room, watching the game.  While he was watching, he felt a strange chill in the air.  He felt a little chilly and said, “Whoa…  That’s weird…  Is the air conditioning on too high or something?”  He got up and checked the air conditioner in the room.  The moment he viewed it, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Hmm…  Looks like the air conditioning is working fine.  Maybe it was just in my head.”  So he went back to the sofa and continued to watch the game.  What he didn’t know was the change was starting to take place.  And this change will last an hour until it is complete and he’s going to be three.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Jeff came in and waved at his father saying, “I’m here dad.  Sorry I’m late, I had to finish up something on the computer.”  Of course, what he was really doing was using the Chronivac to make his father younger.  His father looked at him and said, “Oh don’t worry son, at least you didn’t miss much of the game.  Come, have a seat next to me.  The game has just gotten started.”  Jeff smiled and headed straight to his father, immediately sitting next to him.  The moment he sat down, he took a quick look at his father and could tell that nothing hasn’t changed yet.  From what he could tell, he was just a middle age man with in mid fifties, like 57 years old.<br />
<br />
His build was built for an older adult, but he wasn’t like he always been at a younger age.  He had a beer belly on his stomach, his arms showed some flabbiness, and his chest looked a little saggy.  His face looked bad with his eyes looking tired after all the hours of working at the office and he was rugged with a few whiskers on one of his cheeks.  His head use to have a full set of black hair.  But now, his hair was a mixture salt and pepper of gray streaks dotting everywhere with a little white in a few places.  Not to mention he was half bald with a comb over covering his bald spot.  His clothes were a little old for him with a button long sleeve shirt, a dark blue tie, brown kaki’s and a pair of dark brown slip on loafers.  Jeff could tell that his father was a little too old after all these years.  He thought making him three would ultimately make his life even better.<br />
<br />
Upon starring at him, Jeff’s father looked at him and asked, “Um…  Why are you looking at me like that?”  Jeff blinked and turned his head away, thinking of a way to say something to him.  He then said, “Oh…  It’s nothing really.  I’m just glad that we are sharing a moment together.”  His father smiled and said to his son, “Yeah.  You’re right for once.  We haven’t done much of a father son bonding time for a long time.  I mean with my job and all, I never had any time what so ever.  Thank goodness that I have a day off so that way we could spend some quality time together like father and son.”  Jeff nodded as he started to watch the game, knowing that their bonding will grow stronger when he starts regressing.<br />
<br />
The two kept on watching the game and were enjoying the play by play.  When the first break got by at the first ten minutes, Jeff’s father sighed and stretched a little bit.  “Oh boy!  That was a nice play huh son?” he asked, feeling a little energized.  Jeff looked at his father and responded, “Yeah, it sure is.”  When he looked at his father, he notices a few subtle changes, but not so much.  For one, the baldness of his head is gaining a few strands of gray and black hair through the scalp and there was very little white within his gray and black hair.  His arms look like they were regaining a little muscle then before and was looking less worn, but still showed some flabbiness.  Still, he was the same with the exception that he’s a little younger, like at the age of fifty-two.  His clothes still look the same, but its just he’s still old for those clothes.  But he can tell that he was starting to get a little younger.<br />
<br />
Heading back to the game, the two kept watching and saw a barray of tackles, passes, and the occasional fumbles.  Within the next ten minutes, another commercial break.  This gave Jeff the time to see his father’s progress.  What he saw was his father looking a little younger then before.  In fact, he looked to be about 47-years-old.  More hair grew in his bald spot while the white was all gone, only to be replaced with black and gray strands.  The skin on his arms was getting less flabby and harder as the muscles on them tightened up.  He even notice his beer belly looked a little deflated, but it was still round and was visible underneath his shirt.  Speaking of which, his clothes looked the same but his tie unwrapped itself and was hanging around his neckline.  Jeff found that a little strange but he decided to go with it.<br />
<br />
When the game got back on, there was a timeout the next five minutes.  “A time out?” his father asked sounding a little clearer, “Are you kidding me?  That was an official play!”  As he was annoyed by the uncalled decision, Jeff turned to him and noticed more changes taking place.  So far, he was 43 years of age and was regaining most of his strength.  The arms were looking more muscular as his belly shrank some more.  His face was looking less worn out and was regaining little youth in his complexion.  Even his hair almost looks like a full head, as the bald spot seem to look less and less noticeable.  Not to mention that there seems to be a little less gray on his hair then before.  Still, his clothes look the same as he still had a job.  But he could see a few buttons at the top unbuttoning themselves as evident that he was showing off a little of his chest.  Still, he looked like a middle age man who was unwinding after a long day of working.  But Jeff knows that his father’s unwinding will get more and more unwinding in the minutes to come.<br />
<br />
Once the time out was out of the way, the game resumed and it was getting more intense.  At the same time, Jeff’s father was feeling more rallied up then ever.  That is because all that energy in his body was slowly returning as he continued to get younger.  Jeff noticed that and could tell that the program was working its magic on him.  When the next commercial break came, it had been another ten minutes.  This gave Jeff the opportune time to look at his father again.<br />
<br />
From what he could tell, his father left his forties behind and entered his thirties.  He actually looks like a 38-year-old man who was enjoying himself.  He was gaining biceps on his arms, thus making them look less weak and stronger.  In fact, he could see his physic returning ever since it was long gone by over working and lack of exercise.  His face was even getting youthful as the tiredness and shabbiness faded away.  There was no sign of baldness on his hair as more black dominated the gray hairs.  His clothes then started to change as his buttoned up shirt changed color to a deep red and his pants were a pair of dark blue regular pants.  Jeff watched it all go down and noticed that his father was becoming more of a stud back in the day.<br />
<br />
Feeling a little woozy, he looked at his son and said to him, “I’m going to use the bathroom for a second.  Let me know what happens at the game when I get back.”  Jeff nodded and said, “Okay.  Don’t take too long.”  With that says, Jeff’s father left him and headed to the bathroom while Jeff watched the game.  While he was watching, he started to think.  He finds it amazing that his father started to grow younger in front of him and could tell that he was in great shape back when he was young.  He also finds it even stranger that his father didn’t expect any of it since he’s mentally regressing as well.  And even if he chooses it, the reality change hasn’t settle in yet.  He just couldn’t wait until the process is complete and his father would become a cute little child.  Just as he was thinking about it…<br />
<br />
“So, what I missed?”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned around and was surprised at what he was seeing.  Standing before him was his father, or a younger version of his father.  From what he could tell, he looks like a young man at the age of thirty-two.  He looked stronger then ever with tight muscle arms, a pumped up chest, and a fairly mid high build.  He didn’t see a beer gut either, as it was thin and flat.  His face had a drastic change as well.  Gone was the dark circles and the withered looks, now in its place was a handsome rugged face.  And his hair had very little gray on it with a full head of black shiny hair.  His clothes made a drastic change as well, as he went through the metamorphosis.  His buttoned shirt changed color again and had a pocket appearing at one side.  His pants shortened and the color changed to brown, making them look like cargo shorts.  His socks rose a little higher and were ankle length as his shoes opened up and changed into a pair of stylish sandals.  But the one thing Jeff noticed out of everything else was that his father didn’t have his wedding ring with him.  If he remembered correctly, his father didn’t marry his mother until he was thirty-four.  So from what he could tell, his father was single and he didn’t have the family’s last name.  From now on, he was called Jonathan Obritch Jackson and he started up on his job.  Not only that, but reality around Jeff started to change and his father was now his uncle.  The pictures on the walls and stand changed to a different person marrying his mother and memories of the family began to alter.  Jeff looked at him and couldn’t believe after five minutes in the bathroom, his father had turned into a hunk back in his days.<br />
<br />
His father, or Uncle John looked at his nephew and was concerned.  He then said, “Well…  What happened?  I’m waiting…”  Jeff blinked and shook his head, almost forgetting that John wants to know how the game is.  Immediately realizing it, he said to him, “Oh…  It’s nothing uncle John.  You didn’t miss anything.  Just a little fumble is all.”  John sighed to himself and said, “All thank goodness…  I thought I missed out on anything crazy.  Thanks for keeping watch on the game.  You have always been my favorite nephew.”  Jeff smiled and nodded; knowing that minutes ago John was once his father.  Now that he has become his uncle, John can now kick back and enjoy his time with his nephew.  Sitting next to Jeff, John kicked back and continued to watch the game.<br />
<br />
For another ten minutes, there were a few more serious plays as two teams duke it out to see who is the best.  After a long play, the first quarter was over with and there was a bit of a break.  With that said, John stretched his legs and said, “Boy, that was some game huh Jeff?”  Jeff turned to his uncle and nodded in approval.  While nodding, he took a good look at the changes John was sucumming too and was amazed by it.<br />
<br />
Now, John looked like he was 28-years-old with no sign of any worn out versions of his older self.  His muscles were strong and broad while his chest pushed out to show off some of his manliness.  His arms were completely hard and make them look like he’s been in the gym three to four times a week.  He even noticed hair coming out of his arms with a fine dusting to make him look like a woman magnet.  He also noticed that his uncle’s clothes looked different as well.  His buttoned shirt opened up fully, revealing his body while the pocket disappears and the color changes into a floral design, making it look like a Hawaiian buttoned shirt.  With the shirt changed, Jeff got a good look at his former father’s body.  His chest of stacked and looked completely hard.  Even his stomach changed in a really good way.  That beer belly he had in all the years of drinking and over eating was long gone with no evidence of that what do ever.  Now his gut was completely flat and it was showing off some hardcore six-pack abs.  He could also see some fine dusting of hair on his chest and a treasure trail up his stomach.  His shorts remanded the same but look tighter on his waist.  He took a quick peak at his legs and could tell that they too were muscular and made them feel like they were tree trunks.  His socks immediately disappeared, making him sockless.  But that changed as his sandals were changing to match his look.  They were now looking like Hawaiian sandals with a tight design and the cool looking straps.  His face was beyond handsome with a stiff look on his skin, and broader jaw line.  His hair was lustful and completely full with no gray streaks what so ever.  Jeff was impressed by his father, since he use to have been a strong and buffed up guy.  Though he wasn’t much as a body builder, he is that of a male supermodel who always looking for a lady.  In fact, he almost looks like he graduated college and was hoping to find a woman since he wasn’t married to his wife yet.  Staring his uncle down, Jeff smiled and said to him, “Oh yeah…  That was a great game.”<br />
<br />
When the game was finished, Uncle John got up from his seat and dusted himself off.  “Well…  I’m going to go get myself a drink.” he said feeling a little thirsty, “Want some?”  Jeff looked at his uncle and said to him, “Just a coke please.”  John nodded and headed to the kitchen to some drinks in the fridge.  While he was away, Jeff thought about his former father and found it odd that John was an athletic man.  Let along one that has the hunger for a woman before getting married.  He never told him anything about it, but I guess that’s how men around their thirties are like.  Still, he just wonders what would happen if the changes progressed.  So he waited until something happens.  While he was waiting…<br />
<br />
“Here you go.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard a voice that was like his former father, only a little youthful.  Turning his head, he saw John holding a can of coke with one hand and a bottle of beer with the other.  But that wasn’t what he was looking at.  What he was looking at was his father looking younger then ever.  It’s been already three minutes and John now looks like a 25-year-old going through college.  His physic and clothes still look the same, but a white sleeveless shirt was underneath his buttoned shirt to cover his body up.  Plus reality began to alter as he was become the eldest of the family since he’s too young to be a father let alone an uncle.<br />
<br />
With all the changes in place, John approached his younger brother and said to him, “And here’s your coke.  And this beer is mine.”  He gave Jeff the coke can while sitting down with the beer in his hand.  “So, did the second quarter start yet?” he asked in anticipation.  Jeff just looked on and was shocked by his former father’s reaction.  He almost sound like that of a college frat boy wanting to know about the game.  Not wanting to loose his cool, Jeff said to him.  “Uh…  No.  Actually, the second quarter has started.”  With that said, John smiled and said to himself, “Awesome!  I don’t want to miss a thing in that game.”  So he took a sip on his beer and continued on watching.<br />
<br />
Within six minutes, the game was starting to get good.  But just as it was getting good, a yellow flag came into the field.  John grunted to himself and knew what that meant.  “Oh great…” he said while drinking his beer, “They put a flag in the middle of the field.  That means someone made a mistake.  God this is going to take a while.”  He then slouched down and waited for the penalty to come.  While he was waiting, Jeff took a good look at him and sees if there were any changes.  So far, he hasn’t changed much, but he did regress down to a couple of years.  Now he looked like a 22-year-old, or to be more precise, the twin brother of his older sibling.  Though not much has changed in his physic, the muscles look a little smaller then before.  Being that he must’ve spent less time at the gym then his older years.  But his clothes still look the same.<br />
<br />
As he was watching the game, he started to feel a little hot as he flapped the collar of his sleeveless T trying to get some air.  He then turned to his younger brother and said to him, “Hey.  Is it getting a little toasty in here?  Cause I’m feeling a little hot all of a sudden.”  Jeff looked at him and shrugged his shoulders.  “I don’t think so.” he said with little confusion, “The air conditioner was on most of the time.”  But John didn’t buy it as he was trying to keep himself cool.  “Well it still feels a little hot.” he then retorted back, “Better take off my buttoned shirt to keep myself cool.  So he stood up and removed his buttoned shirt slowly.  While he was doing that, Jeff got a good look at what he was wearing underneath.  It was a white cotton sleeveless shirt men use to exercise and lifting weights.  Once he removed his clothes, he took a breather and said, “Ah…  That’s much better…”  He then sat back down and watched the game again.<br />
<br />
After another five minutes of waiting, the referee of the game came in and told the crowd that there was an illegal tackle and the play needs to restart.  John heard it and sighed to himself, saying, “Finally…  About time they came to a decision.  I was almost getting bored to death.”  Jeff listened to his former father’s voice and could tell that his mood had changed during the regression.  It almost sounds like he was a little impatient his voice almost sounds like someone who left his teenhood behind.  Turning to him, he looked on and could tell that he was right for once.  What he was looking at was a 20-year-old late teen entering his adult phase and graduated high school.  His muscles seem to deflate a little bit but it still showed some broadness in them and his height started to shrink to an inch or two.  He guessed that his older brother is starting to go through his reverse puberty and the height was the first thing that happened.  His clothes then started to change as well, starting with the sleeveless gym T.  The hole at the end of his shoulder grew longer and came down his arms, stopping midway.  This means that he has sleeves on his T-Shirt.  The shirt itself changed color into a deep red and had a fancy logo of a clothing company young adults usually wear.  His cargo shorts change color and style, with the fabric turning hard and the color to blue.  In moments, the shorts were now blue jean shorts.  His sandals were closed off the shapshift, changing texture, style, and color.  They now look like a pair of Nike N7 LunarGlide+ 3 Running shoes for a simple run on the tracks.  His socks reappear on the feet and they had become white like a ghost.  With the body and clothes out of the way, John’s face shaped a little bit with his nose growing a little smaller and his jaw line compressing a bit.  There was also a little peach fuzz on his chin and his hair looked a little bit shaggy.  As he regressed, something strange happened.  For one, John was drinking his beer.  But being that he was twenty, he doesn’t need the beer, so reality changed a little bit.  The beer bottle expanded and shortened into a cylinder like structure with the label changed from a beer company to a Coke logo.  In the can, the beer liquid morphed into a Coke liquid.  In moments, John went from drinking a beer to drinking a coke can just like Jeff.<br />
<br />
With the penalty taken care of, the game resumed at the two kept watching it.  The game lasted another five minutes until there was a commercial break.  Once it got to that break, John was stoked and said in sheer excitement, “Wow!  That was an incredible play!  Did you see that bro?  Where the guy pulled him down to prevent the touchdown?  That was awesome!!!”  Jeff heard his father’s voice and could tell that he sounded like an amped up teen then an adult.  So turning to him, he told him, “Yeah!  That was exciting!”  While saying that, he took a good look at his former father and saw the end result.<br />
<br />
Staring right at him was John as a sixteen-year-old, preferably making him the twin brother of Jeff.  His height went through a few shrunk spurts as he now stood at 4’7.  At the same time, most of the muscles he gained when he was an adult were slowly dwindling away.  His weren’t as impressive as before while the rest underneath his clothes drew away.  He now looked like a gawky skinny teen then a muscular man.  His face then change dramatically as his skull structure started to round and his nose got smaller.  During the change, Jeff noticed a few pimples dotting around John’s face.  He guessed that acne was the cause of it when he was a teenager.  He was also showing his teeth, which had braces on them.  If Jeff would’ve known, his father used to have braces when he was fourteen and had them off when he was seventeen.  His hair then started to get a little messy as it looked like he hasn’t did his hair in a long time.  His clothes changed once more as his T-shirt grew dark and had a logo of his favorite alternative rock band.  His jean shorts grew long and covered his legs completely as they have become long jeans.  His Nike sneakers changed into a different pair with a different design and a different color.  They now look like a pair of Nike Men's Shox Classic II SI Running Shoes.  While the changes were done, reality began to remold as picture frames and memories of family and friends began to alter.  Under Jeff’s point of view, his father would’ve made a great twin brother let alone a younger brother.  But he digressed as he and his twin brother watched the game like any other sibling.<br />
<br />
After another ten minutes of constant plays, long throws, and the occasional tackles, the game went straight to another commercial break.  With that done, John leaned back and smiled at the performance.  “Oh boy…” he said in with a voice a few octaves higher, “This game is intense.  Who would’ve thought the opposing team is hard to beat?”  Jeff smirked and said back to him, “Yeah…  That’s pretty hectic.”  Turning to him again, he could tell that John is fast regressing past his teens.<br />
<br />
He almost look like he was twelve, already a pre teen and almost before his puberty.  He dropped more in height as shrank to below four feet.  In fact, the sudden shrunk spurt caused his feet to lift off the ground and dangled of it.  All of his muscles were long gone, leaving him nothing but thin, skinny twigs for arms and legs.  Even his chest was flat as a board and his abs melted into nothing.  His face went from someone a woman would love to that of a child.  His structure was round and stout, his nose was very small, and his pimples were vanished completely, only to be replaced by freckles dotting his forehead.  He could even see his father’s teeth looking a little crocked, being that it was long before he had braces on in the first place.  The peach fuzz on his chin disappeared and left his skin completely smooth.  Plus his hair straightened out and looked like it was cut short.  The clothes changed some more, as the shirt turned dark blue and had the Star Wars: The Clone Wars on it.  His pants lifted up again to reveal his legs and returned to boy shorts.  His shoes grew small to match his small feet and look like a black and red Nike Air Max for kids.  And again, with the mental changes on and reality altering, John went from being the twin brother of Jeff, to his younger brother.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared in awe while John was hypnotized by the TV.  Seeing him go from a father, to uncle, to older brother, twin brother, and younger brother made it look so entertaining.  Still, the changes aren’t finished yet.  There is still a ways to go before the changes were complete.  So he sat back and waited for the changes were finished while John, thought youthful and carefree, was filling up with so much energy that he was getting too excited.  “Go, go, go!  Beat them up!  Beat em’ up!  Win it for us!  Yeah!” he said with sheer joy with his voice cracking a little higher.<br />
<br />
So the two kept on watching the game that was filled with craziness and rough housing.  In six minutes, the game was down to the wire and two minutes were left in the game.  Of course, that means that there would be temporary time outs here and there.  As the commercial break started, Jeff took another look at his younger brother and noticed that he has entered the single digits in his life.  He looked like he was now seven and was engrossed by the program.  His body grew consistently smaller and there was little baby fat on his arms and legs.  His face was getting cuter and cuter by the minute as his cheeks puffed up and his nose was as small as a button.  His hair has gotten shorter and started to get thin.  His clothes have gotten smaller to match his age and looked a little cuter.  His shirt grew bright red and had a picture of Bob the Builder.  The pants got smaller too and remain the same as before.  And his shoes changed into plain Nikes while his socks grew smaller, turning into anklet shocks.  Looking at his former father, Jeff knew that the changes were almost finished.  Just five more minutes and it will all be over.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the last five minutes passed after the game went into some small breaks.  When the two minutes were up, the second quarter was finished and the game was at a tie score.  That was when an incredibly young John got up and jumped up and down in celebration.  “Yay!!!” he screamed out loud in a youthful voice, “That was fun!”  Jeff then looked at his younger brother and saw that the changes were finished.  Now John had become and three year old toddler while reality warped to match his age.  His body was very small and the muscles that he once had was now baby fat up his arms and legs.  His stomach was expanding into a baby gut, as he was a little chubby on his face.  His hair was incredibly short and was completely wispy.  His clothes changed into what a toddler usually wears.  His shirt was a baby blue T with a picture of Blue’s Clue on it.  His shorts turned into toddler shorts with fill up his around his fat legs.  In his shorts, his underwear began to crinkle up a little bit, turning into training pants.  That was because he was still potty-trained back when he was three and stopped doing that when he was four.  His shoes vanished into thin air and all that’s left were small anklet socks.  Even the button shirt he took off back when he was in his twenties transformed, as the fabric grew soft and the color changed to dark blue, turning into a toddler blanket.  For the last time reality warped around him as memories and pictures began to alter. It’s even evident on his drink as well, as the coke can shrank a little more and lost it’s logo, changing color from red to blue with a Blue’s Clue logo.  On the lip of the can, there was a small little rectangular hole poking out, letting him sip right into it.  While inside the cup, the coke liquid turned white and lost all of its fizz, turning it into something completely healthy.  When the changes were done, John’s coke can was turned into a Tipi cup filled with milk.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the end result and was pleased by it.  Over the course of ninety minutes, John went from being a father of three, to a young three year old who has two brothers and one sister.  Thinking if its wise, Jeff slide to him and said, “So John, did you like the game?”  John just looked at his older brother and said in a lispy expression, “Oh it was gweat Jeff.  Tanks for spending time wit me.  My sister and older bwother never have the time to hand out wit me because dey are always busy.  And mommy never spend time wit me because she has work to do.  But you are never busy so I am happy when you are here.”  Jeff smiled and could tell that his former father would be happy in this age.  But as he was looking at him, he came up with a really good idea.  So he look to his younger brother and said, “I need to head to my room for a second.  There is something I need to take care of quick.  You be a good boy and stay here until I come back okay?”  John looked at him very strangely but shrugged it off and said, “Okay…”<br />
<br />
So Jeff went upstairs and headed to his room.  When he entered it, he saw the Chronivac that finished with the first request and waiting for another one.  Sitting on his desk, he looked at the program and decided to…</p>
