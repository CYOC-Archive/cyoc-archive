<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Work felt like it would never end. The leers from the other employees only made it all the less comfortable. However, he couldn&#39;t help but be turned on at the same time. Each time he went to the bathroom, he felt the need to jerk himself off again. And each time he was thinking about the other guys, he was finding it harder to resist.<br />
<br />
Donovan knew he needed to get out of there. His body craved the attention. Even as he drove home, he squirmed in his seat thinking about what those guys could do to him. He felt his asshole tingle with excitement. With his attention completely drawn to the fantasy, he didn&#39;t realize just how fast he was going until he heard the whirl of a siren and seen the red and blue flashing lights behind him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Donovan cursed as he started to slow down and pull to the side of the highway. His heart started to race a bit more. Donovan watched his mirror as the officer stepped out of his car. The man was fairly average build, nothing too big, but that didn&#39;t mean he couldn&#39;t handle himself in a fight. His lean build fit his average height well, not making him look too intimidating but not too soft either. He walked with a firm and confident gait. Each step made with purpose as his black boots kicked around the rocks beneath him. The officer tapped on Donovan&#39;s window. Donovan rolled it down. &quot;Evening officer,&quot; he said trying to keep a lighter tone. His hands remained at ten and two while he looked forward.<br />
<br />
However, even behind the officer&#39;s sunglasses, Donovan couldn&#39;t help but notice a sly look directed at him. &quot;Evening,&quot; he nodded. A grin graced the corner of his mouth. &quot;You know why I pulled you over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it because of my naturally good looks?&quot; Donovan asked. Any other time, he would have cringed at something like this. But the flirty statement left him without a sense of irony or remorse. His thick muscular arms even flexed a bit, showing off their definition.<br />
<br />
The officer let out a hearty laugh. &quot;Seems like that&#39;s just a bonus.&quot; The partial grin he&#39;d been trying to hide filled out to a full-on smile as his stern demeanor softened. He quickly caught himself. Clearing his throat he continued, &quot;Do you know how fast you were going back there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fast enough for you to notice me?&quot; Donovan continued his flirty banter. &quot;But I can take it a lot slower too.&quot; He gyrated his hips, making the bulge in his jeans more noticeable. &quot;Really I can go whatever speed you want me to. I don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer let out deep, long and heavy breath. He seemed to be having an incredibly difficult time thinking. His gloved hands gripped the car door tightly as his hips leaned further back. Yet, Donovan couldn&#39;t help but notice the clear strain in the other man&#39;s pants as well. The officer swayed a bit to loosen any constriction, but the tight nature of the officer&#39;s pants made it hard to ignore. &quot;S-sir,&quot; he felt the stammer and quickly fixed it. &quot;Sir, I&#39;m going to have to ask you to step out of the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Donovan said. He followed the order. The officer quietly gasped as he realized just how big of a man Donovan actually was. At 6&#39;4&quot; he stood nearly a head taller than the officer and his wide shoulders, thick arms and relatively thin waist made him look almost double the other man. However, the neutral, almost submissive way, Donovan stood made it easy for the officer to maintain control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, put your hands behind your back,&quot; the officer said. <br />
<br />
Donovan did as he was told and felt two pieces of metal touch his wrists. However, they couldn&#39;t quite fit around them. &quot;Don&#39;t know if those are big enough big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; The officer didn&#39;t hesitate. &quot;Put your hands on your vehicle.&quot; Donovan did as he was told and felt the officer&#39;s hands go underneath his shirt. &quot;Just need to make sure you don&#39;t have any weapons on you.&quot; He justified the action. It didn&#39;t matter that Donovan&#39;s shirt nearly clung to his massive torso; the officer made sure to feel every bit of him. He ran his hands up and down the furry chest, feeling the firm muscles then running his leather gloves down his abs. His attention kept drifting south as he undid Donovan&#39;s pants. &quot;And what&#39;s this?&quot; the officer asked feeling a long hard rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my penis,&quot; Donovan answered. He could almost feel the officer turn red. The sudden pause as he reached the end, realizing just how thick and long it actually was, made it obvious he hadn&#39;t been around one this size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ri-right,&quot; the officer said. He massaged the tip slightly. Donovan let out a hearty moan and bumped his ass against the officer&#39;s body. &quot;Right!&quot; the officer realized what he was doing. He undid his own pants and fished his own out. He hadn&#39;t even realized how much it had been throbbing. The excitement was getting to him, and he could barely contain himself. &quot;Just one more place to check,&quot; he pulled Donovan&#39;s pants down enough to expose his asshole. <br />
<br />
The officer pushed in. &quot;Oh!&quot; Donovan moaned loudly as he scrapped his fingers against the car. This only encouraged the officer as he dove deeper into his own desires. He thrust harder and faster, only receiving more exaggerated and excited moans from his partner. His dick throbbed with excite. The feeling of the somewhat tight hole massaging his dick was better than any pussy he&#39;d been in before. He gripped Donovan for support, holding on as tightly as he possibly could so the situation could continue, but sadly it was too much. He felt himself finish. His body thrust several more times out of his control. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed quietly as he leaned into Donovan&#39;s back. The officer quickly tried to take control of himself again as he slowly pulled out. &quot;Nothing there,&quot; he muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? I&#39;d say I felt something pretty big there for a little bit,&quot; Donovan complemented. The officer went red as he adjusted his pants and put his dick away. Six inches wasn&#39;t exactly huge, but the complement was still nice. <br />
<br />
The officer nodded. &quot;Now,&quot; he watched as Donovan pulled up his own pants and leaned against the car. &quot;I&#39;m going to let you off with a warning. But...&quot; he still pulled out a ticket and wrote something on it. &quot;This will be a reminder. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Donovan said as he looked at the piece of paper. It had seven digits on it. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to commit this to memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do. I get off at 10 tonight and have tomorrow off,&quot; the officer said as he went back to his patrol car.<br />
<br />
Donovan Felt the smile on his face fade as he saw the side of his car. He&#39;d given that door a nice coating of white paint. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he groaned. Was this really who he was going to be? But looking at the number on the piece of paper he felt his heart speed up again. He really was a dad people wanted to fuck.</p>
