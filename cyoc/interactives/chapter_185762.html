<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...his little brother. &quot;Matt? You here?&quot; He walked inside and looked around, before leaning outside the room again and closing the door.<br />
It looked like he was about to walk towards Matt&#39;s computer, when he saw the two condoms on the bed.<br />
&quot;Are those...&quot; He whispered something Matt couldn&#39;t hear.<br />
He went to the bed quickly grabbed both of them and left the room as quietly as possible.<br />
The first thing he did after getting back to his room was to lock the door, before jumping on his bed and looking at the condoms.<br />
Matt&#39;s brother held up Ben. &quot;This one&#39;s tiny, i wonder who it&#39;s for.&quot; Matt would be burning with shame right now if he could.<br />
He had set Ben&#39;s size to fit him, wich meant that his little apparently didn&#39;t think much of his &#39;little brother&#39;.<br />
Matt was held up next. &quot;Hmm, i guess it&#39;s a bit small, but it should probably fit.&quot; Matt thought his little brother was overestimating himself.<br />
He was sized to fit Ben, who was by far one of the largest people he knew in that area.<br />
But what he saw when his brother pulled down his pants completely shattered that belief.<br />
His brother was so large that he was shocked he&#39;d never noticed a bulge.<br />
Matt was still stuck on the sheer size of his brother&#39;s shaft,<br />
when his packaging was already torn open and he was about to be pulled over his shaft.<br />
Matt didn&#39;t expect his brother to move so quickly, but had already been filled with that massive dick before he could react.<br />
Pleasure shot through him. The giant thing in him filled him more than Ben ever did.<br />
His brother slowly started to rub his prick, picking up speed as he went along, until he was hammering his hand up and down.<br />
Matt, his mind only barely coherent at this point, despite having become used to being a condom,<br />
thought that his brother wouldn&#39;t take long. This turned out to correct, though not the way he expected.<br />
His brother blew his first load after less than a minute but started again after only a few seconds of rest.<br />
He kept going until the condom was bloated with his 6th load, before stopping for a moment and picking up the other condom.<br />
&quot;I really wonder who this is meant for though. Maybe it&#39;s for that cute guy Matt goes to all the time?&quot;<br />
Matt could feel his brother&#39;s dick twitch. &quot;Mmm, fuck yeah.&quot; Matt&#39;s brother unpacked Ben and rolled him over his index finger.<br />
&quot;Just imagining Matt slamming his dick into that cute ass... he&#39;s so fucking lucky.&quot;<br />
Matt&#39;s brother slapped the index finger with Ben on it with his dick.<br />
&quot;Slapping that cocktail sausage with his giant dick, watching it flop around while he fucks him...&quot; He started stroking himself again.<br />
&quot;Fuck, i never thought imagining how my brother puts that little twink in his place could turn me on so much.&quot;<br />
Matt&#39;s brother shoved the finger with Ben into his mouth after a while and started sucking on it,<br />
only occasionally taking it out to talk dirty. &quot;Yeah, you like that you shrimp dick bitch?<br />
Your&#39;re too small to fuck me, but it&#39;s only fair to suck on this tiny dick once in a while between pounding you into the sheets.&quot;<br />
The stimulation of being rubbed while his brother&#39;s dick was in him, together with knowing that the condom his brother was sucking on was meant for him made, made it feel like his brother was talking to him, wich caused Matt to feel a deep sense of shame.<br />
But for some reason, amidst the shame was a different feeling. He wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but it made him want more.<br />
Something Matt&#39;s brother was going to give in droves.<br />
&quot;Im going to fuck you into the ground &#39;til you can&#39;t walk for a week after you squirt your pathetic little load.&quot;<br />
His hand was picking up more and more speed. &quot;I&#39;m not letting you use that thing for a month after this, so you better make this worth it.&quot;<br />
He kept working himself up. &quot;Maybe i&#39;ll let you touch your baby dick again if you do a good job worshipping my dick the next few weeks.&quot;<br />
He started panting. &quot;But if you don&#39;t do a good job cleaning my balls next time *huff* then i&#39;ll put you in chastity &#39;til your tiny clit-dick can&#39;t get hard anymore. I&#39;ll make sure that tiny thing will only blow it&#39;s load when you get my dick up your ass. No one else will ever be able to satisfy that greedy little fuckhole again. You&#39;ll have to beg me to fuck you if you ever wanna feel this good again, you needy little bitch!&quot;<br />
The load he blew after saying that was largest so far, despite the fact that it was already the 7th.<br />
He flopped backwards onto his bed, dizzy and exhausted.<br />
&quot;Holy shit, i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever been that... that.. i don&#39;t even know what to call it.&quot; He pulled the condom off his dick, tied a knot in it and haphazardly threw it onto the bed next to him, before looking at the one on his index finger. He slowly started to grin.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think i forgot about you, you little slut.&quot; He pulled it off his finger and held the opening over his dick while stroking it,<br />
until he blew a few more spurts of cum out, easily filling the comparatively small condom, before putting a knot in it too.<br />
&quot;Fuck. Now i&#39;m definitely spent.&quot; He looked at the ceiling. &quot;I gotta get some in these sizes.&quot; He closed his eyes.<br />
&quot;Too bad i can&#39;t ask Matt where he got them. I bet he was going to use them with his boyfriend. I bet he&#39;s fucking him right now.&quot;<br />
His thought&#39;s were starting to turn lewd again, when his eyes suddenly flew open. &quot;Shit, i hope he doesn&#39;t suspect i took &#39;em.&quot;<br />
He looked down on himself. &quot;I should probably clean up before he gets back.&quot;<br />
Matt&#39;s brother took the two condoms, hesitating a moment to consider where to put them, and decided to simply throw them under his blanket for the moment, in case Matt checked the room for the missing condoms, before getting up and leaving for the bathroom.</p>
