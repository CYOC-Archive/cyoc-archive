<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her ability to conjure up ideas impacted by the increasingly detrimental state of her mind, Terri wasn&#39;t able to figure out a place to hide before the person approaching came around a corner - not that there was a good place to hide her breathtaking physique anyway. Instead, she was left to stand there, a bit dumbfounded as her slightly glossy eyes landed on the beautiful woman who had started all of this. The vixen that she had, without intending to, destroyed the world thousands of times over for came around the bend, met her eyes, and let her jaw drop.<br />
<br />
Both their jaws were dropping, actually. Aubrey was just that gorgeous. Gorgeous, and completely bewildered as she recognized who she was looking at. &quot;...Terri?&quot; She glanced up and down the blonde&#39;s enhanced body. &quot;I... what... how... you... oh my god!&quot; She was so clearly shocked, though it was impossible to hide warmth that flooded her cheeks, turning them bright red as her eyes lingered for just a moment on the gigantic rack that Terri&#39;s top could only barely keep contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know.&quot; She had her own blush going, along with warmth in certain other areas of her body. &quot;I... um... I&#39;m... trying out a new look?&quot; Oh, she didn&#39;t even try and convince herself that the redhead might buy it. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s really complicated...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s uh... it&#39;s not complicated, you&#39;re just... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hot?&quot; She asked perkily.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I was gonna say slutty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Her heart sank. She was kind of slutty, yeah, and the changing part of her mind thought that was a good thing... but the old Terri, still struggling to keep in control, recognized right away the disgust with which Aubrey had said the word. &quot;I... I kinda hoped... uh... that you&#39;d... that you&#39;d like it...&quot; She sniffed. &quot;I.. I actually... like... you...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long awkward pause, Aubrey putting her hand in her face and looking away, as if words were stuck in her throat. &quot;I... like you... too. But... not like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
She wanted to cry right now. &quot;I know... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She sat down on a bench, head hung in defeat. &quot;I... I&#39;m just... n-nothing can make me pretty enough for y-y-you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You <i>were</i> pretty enough for me.&quot; Her voice was quiet, almost mousy, as she sat down next to the bimbofying Terri. &quot;I... I always thought... you were so cute, and... but... b-but I never... I never had the courage to... say it...&quot; She sighed deeply. &quot;Oh god, you didn&#39;t have to do this... you didn&#39;t have to change at all...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Terri was about to respond to that, however, another, extremely familiar voice spoke up. &quot;Ummmmm. Hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both glanced up to find that, staring right at both of them with wide eyes behind her spectacles was the sight that Terri used to see in the mirror every morning. Herself, one week ago, still a bit out of shape, a bit shorter, and definitely not packing any award-winning rack or perfect ass. She only grew more confused as she realized that a slightly altered version of her own face was on the girl she&#39;d assumed to be Anna, making things even more awkward than they would&#39;ve been if it was just Aubrey here.<br />
<br />
&quot;...hi,&quot; Future Terri and Aubrey both squeaked out.<br />
<br />
The silence hung on a second longer as Past Terri tried to piece things out. &quot;This... you...&quot; She pointed at the blonde version of herself. &quot;Clone?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Alien shapeshifter?&quot; She shook her head even more. &quot;Time travel?&quot; At that, she finally nodded. &quot;Okay, cool, that&#39;s... why... why are you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to know.&quot; That, in fact, was the bimbo side of her speaking - because in the midst of all of this, she suddenly realized the best way to save the world: to play matchmaker. And Bimbo Terri <i>loved</i> being a matchmaker. &quot;It&#39;s not important, okay? What matters is that you two like each other, like a whole whole whole whole lot!&quot; She hopped to her feet, smiling as both girls blushed harder than anyone had blushed before. &quot;So you should totally go out with each other! And don&#39;t ever never try and be other people, because you like each other how you are, and liking somebody how they are is the bestest kind of liking!&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked between each other, completely confused, but there seemed to be an unspoken agreement that, maybe, just maybe, arguing with the bimbo from the future wasn&#39;t a good use of their time. Aubrey was the one who finally broke the silence as she stood up, smiling nervously at Past Terri. &quot;Do you... wanna... go get lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... yes yes yes yes yes.&quot; The asian girl let out a nervous laugh, Aubrey doing the same in response. &quot;I would... really like to do that... and forget this entire thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... let&#39;s... go forget stuff together.&quot; She grinned, grabbing her phone before heading out, Past Terri right on her heels and doing a fist pump. Suddenly, though, she stopped short. &quot;Uh, hey, I&#39;ll be right there!&quot; The redhead nodded in response, giving the girl a chance to look up at her future self. &quot;Whoever the hell you are... thank you thank you thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bimbo Terri smiled brightly, giving her past self a slap on the depressingly flat ass to send her off. Those two lovebirds would be just fine, she was sure of it now - and with the last shreds of her fading mind, she felt certain that all the apocalypses and insanity would be avoided. She&#39;d never be desperate enough to buy a beauty potion, things would never spiral, the world would keep on going just fine, and the girl who&#39;d been willing to do anything for her crush would finally realize that all she ever had to do was just be herself. <br />
<br />
Her past self got an happy ending... but that left the future version of Terri in an odd situation. There was no point to hanging on to her mind, really - she loved the feeling of being airheaded, of living a life dedicated to lust and desire. If she was going to be here in this timeline, then she simply had to find some way to fulfill her carnal desires... and you know, she wasn&#39;t starving for options. Sure, she could just go right out into the world and sell herself, but what about other options? What about Niamh, that adorable redhead who needed somebody to give her some confidence? What about Anna, that super sexy girl whose looks she&#39;d stolen - god, making love to her would surely be mind-blowing! Or even those Rhonda and Sofia girls if she could find them, or that MILF auntie that Niamh had!<br />
<br />
The world was her osyter, really. All she had to do was figure out where she wanted to go, and who she wanted to throw herself at...</p>
