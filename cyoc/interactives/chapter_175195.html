<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ll take my chances with the lotion!” Jonathan said.<br />
<br />
“Great! Now you have a huge selection of scents. May I suggest this bottle,” she held up a bottle labeled “Oranges and Sunshine”<br />
<br />
Jonathan wasn’t a fan of many scents on him. He hated cologne since it all smelt like a musty dog to him. The only scent he actually liked on himself was either lavender or cherries.<br />
<br />
“Do you have anything with lavender or cherries?”<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t think we have cherries, but here is a bottle of lavender lotion.” She handed him the bottle and walked down the aisle. Jonathan took it from her and followed her.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to have any other products? Toys, pacifiers, or even clothes?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“No thanks, I think I’ll manage without them!”<br />
<br />
“Well let me just go and get your diaper bag and you’ll be on your way!” She exited to another room with the door being labeled “Employee only”<br />
<br />
“Miss wait!” Jonathan yelled out. She didn’t turn around at all.<br />
<br />
“I don’t need a diaper bag, everyone will know something is up if I have a bag” He thought to himself.<br />
<br />
The woman returned with a package of diapers and wipes. The diapers were obviously for boys who are 2 years old, but the wipes looked like any other cleaning wipes.<br />
<br />
“Most adults use wipes when they’re experiencing bathroom issues that cause their rears to burn up in pain. You can use that excuse in case they ask.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know that. That’s actually smart.”<br />
<br />
“Well, your total should be $42.12” she said. Jonathan gave her the exact total in cash and coins. She bagged his stuff for him and gave him a receipt.<br />
<br />
“Have a great day!”<br />
<br />
“You too!” Jonathan grabbed his bags and left the store. As he left, he looked at the receipt and saw a message on the bottom. It says, “A store for those searching for their childhood”<br />
<br />
He put the receipt in his pocket and unlocked his car. He dumped everything in the back and drove home.<br />
<br />
When Jonathan got home, he unloaded the car and started to wrap the presents. After a while, he ordered pizza so that he’d be able to eat when he finished.<br />
<br />
Pizza arrived, and Jonathan was able to finish wrapping the gifts. He knew his family well and got them presents that matched their styles. His mother liked baking and ducks, so he got her an apron and oven mitts with cartoon ducks on them. His father like to go fishing, so he got reels and clothes. His little brother George liked video games just like Jonathan, so he got him a few games that he knew he’d like.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the couch, Jonathan opened up the pizza and smelt the delicious scent of pepperoni and sausages. <br />
<br />
Before he ate, he caught a glimpse of a shopping bag he forgot about to the side of him. It was the baby stuff.<br />
<br />
“This probably isn’t real! She probably gave me adult diapers. I bet this lotion makes you go on some acid trip or whatever!” He told himself. Looking around, he decided to close every door, window, and blinds. He didn’t want anyone to see him try what he is about to do.<br />
<br />
Jonathan unbuckled his pants and watched them slide down. He then pulled down his underwear and opened the pack of diapers. Looking at them, they were your average pack of adult diapers. They were solid white with tapes on the side.<br />
<br />
Jonathan tried to get it on, but he wasn’t sure if it was on right. He put his underwear and pants back on, making the diaper hug his manhood tighter. <br />
<br />
“This is making me thirsty! Jonathan said as he got up and walked to the kitchen. He grabbed a bottle of soda and returned to the couch. Then he grabbed the bottle of lotion and squeezed a small amount on his hand. He rubbed the lotion on his hands and planned to rub it on his chest, but when his hands touched his stomach, there was no lotion.<br />
<br />
“Is this trip already starting?” He asked. He put more lotion on his hands and tried again. The same result happened.<br />
<br />
“The fuck?” He said. Suddenly, Jonathan’s body began to change. It shifted and shrank. His pants and underwear slid down, but his diaper stayed on perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Jonathan watched as his living room became bigger and bigger by the second. When it finished, his shirt almost reached his ankles. <br />
<br />
“The fuck happened to me?” He said in a high pitched voice. “The fuck is wrong with my voice? Voice!” He said. Jonathan kept saying voice, trying to reach his pitch before the transformation happened, but he just sounded like a little kid trying to impersonate his dad.<br />
<br />
“Did this actually work?” Jonathan looked at himself under the shirt. The diaper changed into the ones on the package. He let down his shirt and walked over to the bottle of lotion. He turned it over and read the instructions.<br />
<br />
“Lavender scented body lotion for two-year-olds. Each squeeze applied to skin sinks into the pores and rejuvenates and restores the applicants back to their youth. Lotion can withstand head, cold, and even water. You can remove the lotion by wiping down the applied surface with a wet towel or wipe. Must be brushed thoroughly to transform back.”<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! It works!” Jonathan said. He now regretted not buying anything for him to enjoy his new childhood, but he didn’t care anymore after remembering he had food.<br />
<br />
Jonathan turned the tv on and ate pizza. He could usually eat about 5 slices, but his new body could barely handle two.<br />
<br />
After eating, his body experienced a sugar rush due to the soda. There was really one thing he could have done at that point, and that is to have fun.<br />
<br />
For almost an hour, Jonathan ran up and down the stairs, jumped on his bed, and doing completely stupid things his adult body couldn’t. To his surprise, he was quite flexible at his current age. He was still able to touch his head with his feet.<br />
<br />
Sadly, after the sugar rush began to crash, Jonathan decided to sleep downstairs and watch tv. He brought a few blankets and pillows down and bunkered up. Turning off all the lights, the once stressed out adult went to bed.<br />
<br />
As Jonathan slept, he failed to remember two things. <br />
<br />
1. He can apply the lotion multiple times to add more hours<br />
2. That he should always check his phone before going to bed</p>
