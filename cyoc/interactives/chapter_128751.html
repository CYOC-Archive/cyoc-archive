<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was already zoning out as Principal Matthews droned on about the school. He didn&#39;t really care about what his boss was saying. If anything he didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with it. Just get paid to teach. That&#39;s what he was there for. Not to help run the school that was the principal&#39;s job. He leaned into his computer and started to get a little horny again thinking about his huge dick. There was something about it&#39;s size alone that was turning him on.<br />
<br />
He grinned slightly thinking about what he wanted to do. &#39;I can jerk off in public and no one cares,&#39; he typed. However he was still cautious as he unzipped his pants and pulled out his dick. Even at half mast it was a sizable 8 inches and easily noticeable. None of the guys around him seemed to even notice though. Their eyes stayed front while he started stroking his dick. The 8 inches quickly grew. Just holding the huge monster in his hands was a lot. He&#39;d forgotten just how heavy it was. <br />
<br />
Slowly he started to stroke himself. He could feel the pleasure riding up in his system. The more he worked at it the better it felt. He leaned more into the wall right behind him the more he did it. &quot;Why should I keep this pleasure to myself?&quot; he thought with a devilish grin. His hands went back to the computer, &#39;I have a flesh light that let&#39;s whoever i want experience sex with me. The flesh light makes it one of the best sexual experiences the target has had.&#39; <br />
<br />
A good sized flesh light appeared on the counter next to him. Still no one seemed to take notice of him or the object. He thought about Principal Matthews standing in the front of the room as he pressed the tip of his dick onto the tip of the toy. Principal Matthews let out a sudden grunt. It was the first time in his speech that he&#39;d stopped speaking for a second. He scanned the room wondering what the feeling was. As though nothing happened he went back to his speech. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s grin widened. He put his finger on the hole and ran his finger up it. Principal Williams&#39; face shifted. It was a mixture between intense satisfaction and worry. His big hands gripped the podium even tighter. He forced himself back to a standing position. John held his finger on the hole. Slowly he pushed deeper in. Principal Williams face winced as little by little John pushed in. The principal would have to be given an A for effort as he tried to keep his cool. But his grip could only tighten so much around the podium. <br />
<br />
His body started to contract as John&#39;s finger wiggled around inside of him. The principal couldn&#39;t stand it. All his weight had fallen onto the podium as he tried to continue the speech. &quot;Feels so good,&quot; the principal moaned deeply. None of the other teacher acted as though it was out of the ordinary. They sat there watching as the big man in front was just giving another boring speech.<br />
<br />
The flesh light in John&#39;s hands drifted back over his dick. He watched as his boss nearly fell over as the pressure against his large monster pushed against his ass. John pushed hard. He was way too big to fit in the small hole. But he kept trying. The more he tried the more he got in. Principal Mathews&#39; body gripped the podium even tighter. His hips started pushing back. It was like he knew the huge dick was behind him and wanted it inside him as much as John did. Inch by inch he was able to get the huge member inside him.<br />
<br />
Principal Mathews let out a sigh of relief. John had somehow forced his thick 13 inches inside of him. He heard the big man gasp as he started to pull it back out. His boss&#39; face dropped again feeling the dick inside of him. It impossible for him to concentrate as John moved it back and forth. The slow motion getting faster as John came closer to coming. The principal let out several louder moans, filling the classroom with his deep grunts. John finally burst. His come blasting the inside of the other man. The principal let out a loud shout as his own dick splattered the inside of his dark pants. <br />
<br />
John came down from his high. No one in there noticed that there was anything out of the ordinary. One of the teachers asked a follow up question and Principal Mathews answered it like nothing had happened. The only difference being he was slightly out of breath. He quickly ended the meeting. The teachers got up and left the classroom. John watched as Principal Mathews turned around revealing a growing wet spot on the back of his pants as well.</p>
