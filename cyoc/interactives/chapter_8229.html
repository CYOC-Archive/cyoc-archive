<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Big Man on Campus<br />
<br />
“Finally, there’s the east coast!” Ty though to himself. He was looking out through his little airplane window.<br />
<br />
He looked over to the two seats across the aisle from his and saw Dustin and Peter sleeping. He laughed just while thinking about his cousin. Ever since Peter had taken care of those frat boys in Paris, he’s been getting looks and stares wherever he went. His instant celebrity status has made him into the most recognized teen in Paris, so he was happy to get out of there! The video of Peter turning those big frat guys into a baby, a hamster, and an ice cube were broadcast on CNN, making him into this high school hero who stood up against these college guys. <br />
<br />
Even at the airport in Paris, a group of French cheerleaders walked up to him as he was waiting to check in his bag. They cheered together out loud “We love you, Peter!” for everyone in the terminal to hear! Ty had never seen Peter blush like that before, his face turned as red as a tomato as he stood there, all he could do it look down and chuckle to himself. He was so embarrassed, it was funny! Of course, Ty and Dustin were screaming! They were laughing so hard, that tears were coming out of their eyes!<br />
<br />
Then each one of the cheerleaders walked up to Peter and kissed him on his cheeks, leaving his face with red lipstick marks all over! Ty and Dustin thought it was hilarious and they got a good laugh out of it! Poor Peter was left speechless, he was completely flabbergasted! And to make matters even worse, everyone in the terminal recognized him and stared at him. One French boy even walked up to Peter, asking him for his autograph. Peter was very flattered, and signed his name on a piece of paper for the boy.<br />
 <br />
“Our powerful cousin Peter has finally shown his weakness,” Ty had said to Dustin. “He is very shy when girls are around!” All the commotion at the airport had worn him out, and as a result Peter had slept during the entire flight from Paris to Boston.<br />
<br />
The plane had finally landed at Boston’s International airport and taxied to the main terminal. Peter, Dustin and Ty had finally made their way out of the plane and walked through the ramp to the terminal building. Once they had passed customs and immigration, they proceeded to the baggage claim area where they waited to get their luggage before hauling a taxi to the airport. Dustin paid for the trip using the lottery money he had won and he thought it was a good idea to take Ty and Peter on a trip to France and then to go for a drive along the east coast of the U.S.<br />
<br />
When the boys had finally made it to the baggage claim area, they went right up to their carousel to retrieve their bags. Peter got his soft bag first; Ty and Dustin were still waiting for their bags to come out. Peter slowly walked towards the exit in order to wait for them, when a baggage handler came up to him.<br />
<br />
“Do you need any help with your bags, sir?” the uniformed man asked Peter. <br />
<br />
“Yes, sir! We’re still waiting for two other bags to come…” the teen responded.<br />
<br />
The baggage handler turned around to get a cart, which was standing in the corner. While Peter was watching him, he bumped into a large, muscular man who was walking the other way.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me!” the baggage handler said to the big, muscular man, who was obviously irritated that the baggage handler was not looking out where he was going.<br />
<br />
“I wish I was bigger than him and he wouldn’t do that to me!” the baggage handler thought to himself. But since Peter was watching him from a distance, he picked up on the man’s thoughts right away and knew what he was thinking. That’s when Peter decided to have a conversation with him while he was still waiting for Ty and Dustin to get their bags.<br />
<br />
The baggage handler finally came back with a cart; he walked up to Peter, and placed his soft bag on it.<br />
<br />
“Wow that must be hard work, lifting bags all day!” Peter said to him, “Oh by the way my name is Peter. Thanks for helping us.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Jon,” he responded, as he shook Peter’s hand, “pleased to meet you.”<br />
<br />
Jon wasn’t very tall or muscular. He seemed like an average guy to Peter. In fact, the 15-year old Peter noticed that he was already two inches taller than Jon, and he was more muscular than him, too. Jon was about 5-foot-6, which was short for a 23-year-old college senior.<br />
<br />
“You could sure use some more height and muscle! Do you lift weights?” Peter asked Jon, as he looked down at Jon’s face.<br />
<br />
“Yes, although I would love to be much bigger than I am now! I’m lifting a lot and I hope to grow some big muscle soon!” Jon responded, while looking up to the teenager.<br />
<br />
Peter suddenly showed a grin on his face. He wanted to know more about Jon first, but he realized the least he could do was help Jon to grow some muscle. As he looked into Jon’s eyes, Jon suddenly felt a warm tingle go through his body, like he was getting the chills. Little did he realize that Peter had used his powers on him and now knew everything about him. Not only that, but Peter had full control over Jon’s entire body.<br />
<br />
“Are you a student?” Peter asked Jon, although he already knew the answer, but he didn’t want to make it too obvious that he could read Jon’s mind.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jon responded, “I’m a Resident Assistant at my dorm on campus. I’m a senior at my college and I’m studying Social Work. I just want to be the biggest guy on campus so that the other guys in my dorm will respect me. All I want is to be big and buff!”<br />
<br />
“Well I’m still in high school, but I correspond with people from all over the world on the internet.” Peter responded, as he grabbed a pen out of his front pocket of his jeans. “Just give me your email address, okay?” Peter commanded.<br />
<br />
Jon obeyed him right away and grabbed a piece of paper from his desk. He took the ballpoint pen from Peter and wrote his address on it. He then gave the pen and paper back to Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter read the address, and wrote a reminder to himself under the email address that Jon had given him: “Big man on campus. E-mail Jon in 3 weeks about his muscles.” He folded the paper and stuck it in his wallet.<br />
<br />
When Ty and Dustin finally had retrieved their bags, Jon had placed them on the cart and pushed it through the glass doors leading to the street. He hailed a cab, and put the three bags in the trunk of the taxi. Dustin gave him a 5 dollar tip, and Peter said goodbye to Jon as he got into the taxi. After a few minutes, the taxi left the curb by the airport and drove off to bring the three boys to their hotel.<br />
<br />
“Nice kid” Jon thought to himself, as he watched the taxi slowly pull away from the curb. Little did he realize that Peter had used his power on Jon to change him. Somehow Jon knew he would hear from Peter again.<br />
<br />
Three days later Jon sat on the couch in the lounge. There was a large screen TV in the lounge, which was located on the ground floor of his dormitory. He was watching TV when one of the residents walked in.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jon, how’s going?” Jack said. He lived on the floor above Jon. <br />
<br />
“You got to check the washing machine because your shirt looks like it has shrunk in the wash!” he said to Jon.<br />
<br />
Jon was wearing a thin Hanes shirt, but he didn’t notice that it had shrunk at all.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” he asked Jack.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, look how tight it fits you! It looks like it is about to rip!” Jack responded.<br />
<br />
Jon walked back to his room and took his shirt off. He went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He couldn’t tell much difference at all, but when he stepped on the scale he noticed that his weight had gone from 190 to 199 pounds in just three days!<br />
<br />
Then he grabbed another shirt, and put it on. The shirt fit better, so he figured that he just had too much to eat and the shirt had shrunk in the wash.<br />
<br />
About four days later he grabbed a new pair of jeans out of his closet. He had not worn these in over a month, so it was time to wear them for a few days. He put them on and noticed that the bottom of his jeans were about an inch away from his feet. Had he grown a bit taller? No, that was impossible, he thought. He figured these jeans had also gotten too small for him in the wash and that it was possibly becoming time for him to buy some new clothes.<br />
<br />
Jon walked down to the lounge and grabbed the remote to turn on the TV. When he reached out to get the remote, the sleeve on his shirt ripped apart! His bicep was so huge that his sleeve would rip off the shirt! This seemed weird; it was his second shirt in one week he had to throw away. It was definitely time to go to the mall, he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
About three days after that, Jon woke up early that morning. He usually slept wearing a t-shirt and shorts, but something really weird happened that morning. As soon as he got up, he stretched his arms out over his head, and his t-shirt ripped apart, right down the middle! He couldn’t believe it!  His pecs had gotten so big that he would rip out of his shirt in the morning! <br />
<br />
He got on the scale in the bathroom and noted his weight. He was 220 pounds! Then it dawned on him that he had gained 30 pounds over the past ten days! What was going on here?<br />
<br />
When he went back downstairs, he ran into Steve. Steve was a buff guy in his dorm, and he was about three inches taller than Jon as well. But this time, when the two students saw each other, Steve looked at him with a weird look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jon, you look different!” he said.<br />
<br />
“I do?” Jon wondered.<br />
<br />
“You look bigger than you were before… And you seem a bit taller, too!” Steve said.<br />
<br />
Jon looked at him in the eyes and realized that they were exactly the same height! Not only that, but Steve noted that Jon appeared more muscular than before.<br />
<br />
“Have you been working out these days?” Steve asked his buddy.<br />
<br />
“No, I haven’t been to the gym all week! Do I look bigger to you?” he responded.<br />
<br />
“How come you are my height? I used to look down on you and now you’re like a few inches taller!” Steve said, completely amazed by Jon’s sudden growth.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. It must be a growth spurt or something!” was all Jon could really say to him. He was delighted by the compliments he was getting, it was great! Nobody ever wanted to have anything to do with him because he was skinny and short, but now people started noticing changes and he loved it!<br />
<br />
Later on Jon went to his dorm room and asked Steve to get his tape measure. Jon stood against the wall and his friend gently pushed him with his back and head against the wall. He then made a mark on the wall with a pencil, from the top of Jon’s head. Then Steve measured the distance from the floor to the pencil mark, in order to determine Jon’s height.<br />
<br />
“Hey dude, guess what? You’re five-foot-nine inches tall!” Steve responded.<br />
<br />
Jon was elated. He had grown three inches taller in just a few weeks! And he had gained thirty pounds of muscle! Obviously there was something going on with his body but he couldn’t understand how or why it was happening now.<br />
<br />
Another ten days had gone by when Jon weighed and he noticed he was at 250 pounds! He had gained sixty pounds of muscle and three inches in height in barely three weeks! He walked into the bathroom and looked at himself and realized how big and buff he had become. As he opened the door to his dorm room, his shirt ripped apart as well, making it his third ripped shirt in three weeks. He then tried on three other shirts ion his closet, only to realize that he had outgrown his wardrobe and needed to borrow shirts from one of the other residents for the time being! His chest was about 48 inches, he had an incredible six pack of abs and his biceps were approaching eighteen inches, a far cry from how he looked barely three weeks earlier when the growth spurt began!<br />
<br />
Three days later he was using the computer in the library to check his email online. When he reached over to grab the mouse, the shirt he was rearing at that time ripped apart! It wasn’t even his, and he noticed he had grown some more again. Several football players walked by, and looked at him in awe.<br />
<br />
“Jon? Is that you? Why you look like you should be on the team with us!” one of them said out loud.<br />
<br />
Jon felt lucky he could still wear most of his jeans, although they had now become too short for him, due to his three-inch increase in height! When he would walk around the dorm, all the guys would start calling him “big guy” and no longer looked down on him for being the short, average looking Resident Assistant. Jon just loved the looks, the compliments, the stares, and the new nickname he had been getting from his buddies and he felt like he was slowly being transformed into the biggest, strongest, and most muscular guy on campus!<br />
<br />
And when Jon walked out of the library the most interesting thing happened to him: As another jock was walking towards the library entrance, he didn’t see him and they both ran into each other. Only this time, Jon was big and strong enough to remain standing, while the other guy had lost his balance and fell on the floor!<br />
<br />
“Whoa, sorry dude! I wasn’t paying attention, big guy!” the jock said, as he slowly got up.<br />
<br />
Jon thought it was funny that this was finally happening to him. Someone else would bump into his Jon’s big, muscular body, and he was not the one who ended up falling down for a change!<br />
<br />
A few days later he realized that he had gained another nine pounds of muscle in three days, and was now weighing in at 259 pounds. Then he went to the library again, and he received this email:<br />
<br />
Dear Jon,<br />
How’s going? I just wanted to say hi and touch base with you! Maybe you don’t remember me but I’m the kid you had met at the airport just over three weeks ago! Send me an email and let me know how you’re doing, okay?<br />
Greetings, Peter Karlowski<br />
<br />
PS. How do you like your new, big muscles? Now you truly should be called the “Big man on campus”! I will allow your body to gain three pounds of muscle per day until you reach 300 pounds. Anyway, let me know if that is enough. Email me if you need more or if you want me to change anything else about you!<br />
Best regards, PK.<br />
<br />
Wow! That explains it! Jon thought he was dreaming. it seemed too incredible to believe that this kid was responsible for his growth spurt! Not only that, but he was still able to change his body and make it grow even more, if he had requested it! He couldn’t understand how a fifteen-year-old kid had the ability to make his body grow to whatever height or weight he wanted to, but it didn’t matter to Jon! He was big and buff now, and that’s all that mattered to him. It dawned on him that this mysterious kid had some degree of control over Jon’s own body and it frightened him a little. But when he looked in the mirror and saw how Peter had changed about him so far, he wasn’t worried anymore. Somehow Jon got a feeling that he could trust Peter, and that Peter was watching him from a distance!<br />
<br />
Jon decided to reply to Peter’s email. He started off with a big “thank you for the muscles!” and then paused to think about what he was going to ask Peter next.</p>
