<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say Ken was angry when his brother returned would be an understatement. He was livid, pulling at his restraints and trying to shout around the respirator&#39;s tube. Tommy just looked at him with a bemused expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;What got you worked up so much Bro? Loosing your hair? The catheter or the respirator? Or realizing what being part of the experiment means?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken glared at Tommy as he calmly began to ready several syringes. With practiced easy Tommy calmly injected Ken&#39;s testicles eliciting a muffled shout from Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Bro, try to keep it down. Some people here are trying to work. Besides it was just a little jab. The next one will be bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy shook his head before taking the next syringe, this one had an overly long and thick needle. Grabbing Ken&#39;s cock Tommy calmly inserted the needle down the center of it to the base. He slowly depressed the plunger as he pulled the needle out of Ken&#39;s cock, to his muffled protests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much less of a reaction, good that means that the drugs are working as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Ken grew still, looking at Tommy puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets just say you will be much less of a man when we are done here. But don&#39;t worry, we have some follow up experiments planned that are quite promising.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken&#39;s faced went through various expressions of confusion, shock and anger at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your contract states that we can extend it at will if we think that it will benefit our research. Mind you you still get paid the initial amount, in case of the first extension for another ten years. Oh and at the end of that we can extend again. And trust me, we have a lot of experiments to go through with you bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy took another syringe causing Ken to resume his futile struggles, though his movements were slowing down noticebly. As Tommy got into position to perform the next injection Ken had already fallen asleep. Tommy silently completed the injections before turning to Alfonse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure to set up the IV later, just the nutrient solution and saline for now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. May I ask how you managed to have him sign the contract without reading it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Simple, my big bro never took me seriously. The rest was just letting his need for money work for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
After this Tommy left, leaving the nurse to complete his work. Having complete his round Tommy went to Dr. Winkler&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right on schedule. Anything of note?&quot;<br />
&quot;A small observation. When I injected my brother with the prescribed dose of GN-P5 his reaction was rather subdued to compared to the preceding injection of GN-T3 to his testicles. I am unsure of the reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;There are a few possible answers there, the previous injection of GN-P5 or the general anesthetic effect of the drug cocktails.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. I will try to figure out which it is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. By the way, your brother being a test subject here causes me some concern about you being able to remain professional. Are you certain you will be able to adhere to the protocols?&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you for your concern, but there is no need to worry. No matter what happens to my brother I am fine with it.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you have no issues or preferences regarding which group he will placed in for the long term storage?&quot;<br />
&quot;None at all. Though there is something in this matter I would like to suggest for your consideration. We seem to lack a group which would undergo a reeducation regime while in storage. We have a sufficient number of test subjects that we can afford to set up another such group. I have an outline of that re-education regime with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy hands Dr. Winkler a small stack of papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just an outline it seems. I see you have put quite a bit of thought into this matter. I will consider your suggestion together with the rest of the team.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You will be a great addition to our team once you completed your doctorate. Keep up the good work.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Ken was having another vivid dream of him being fucked by his brother as he suddenly awoke. He could again feel someone working at his rear. Looking down past the breathing tube he could see his brother Tommy and the nurse at the feet of his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Bro. Good news, the injections are almost done. Today is probably the last round as your genitals are almost completely gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken again started to struggle in his restraints while his brother calmly noted down the changes on a clipboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prostate, 1cm ... Testicles, 0.8cm ... Penis, 3.2 cm ... Or if you prefer inches 0.4, 0.3 and 1.3 respectively. Your nipples are completely gone which saves us the need to inject them again. And tomorrow we can start on your final transformation for the experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken was thrashing in his restraints at that point to the bemused chuckles of both Tommy and the nurse. Tommy simply readied a set of syringes with different drugs while the nurse pushed down on Ken&#39;s body to keep it steady. Without a word Tommy injected the drugs into Ken who soon fell asleep again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is that. Alfonse, clean him out thoroughly. We don&#39;t want any mess tomorrow when he undergoes the transformation process.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes doctor. One question though, are those changes really permanent?&quot;<br />
&quot;They very much are. Only the transformation tomorrow can be reversed, the rest is permanent.&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy again left the room as the nurse set to work.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Ken woke to the feeling of something wet on his crotch. As he looked down he could see his brother doing something between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Bro. You woke up at the perfect time. I just confirmed that your entire genitals are gone. That means we can commence with the next stage of the experiment, the rubberization. Don&#39;t worry, it will only take about a day for the change to complete and the most difficult part is to hook you up with the IVs. So just relax and enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken wanted to shout, he wanted to struggle, or do anything at all, but his body refused to cooperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see the relaxants are already doing their job, excellent. That means we can start with the rubberization.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy carefully inserted the needles of several IVs into Ken&#39;s arms and legs, making sure that each would sit perfectly before releasing the stoppers. Ken immediately felt the cool liquid flood his veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing left to do here aside of moving you into storage tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy and the nurse left the room as Ken felt his body slowly growing cold.</p>
