<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Come onnn Jace, there will plenty of people to ogle you on the way back” <br />
Jace kept stopping in the street to flex for everyone he saw. He blew a kiss to any girl he found attractive, and when they blushed, he began licking his lips seductively. A few guys even passed with clearly visible boners in their shorts. Rather than acting disgusted, Jace started winking instead. When he did, they usually stopped for a second in surprise; Tom could tell they had just cum in their pants. <br />
“What was that all about? You’re not even into guys!” he asked<br />
“Hey, it’s been almost a week since I’ve gotten any real action, and this bloodhound in my pants is about to explode” <br />
Tom hadn’t fucked anyone in nearly a month. Stifling a scream, he pulled Jace along, saying “the sooner we get there, the sooner we can get out and get you laid.” <br />
<br />
About five minutes later, just outside of Guillaume’s studio, they heard a whistle from across the street. They looked and saw Christy, dresses in the sexiest black romper and sunglasses Tom had ever seen. By the time he had gotten control over himself and averted the same crisis Jace had inflicted on three guys already, Jace was already across the street with his arm around her waist and her eyes transfixed on his ever-growing bulge. Wanting to be spared the details of their encounter for his own crumbling self-esteem, Tom rushed upstairs to meet Guillaume and beg for a portrait of his own.<br />
He knocked on the door.<br />
“Who ees eet?” He heard from inside. <br />
“Here to pick up a portrait we commissioned last month” said Tom. <br />
“Ahh, com right inside!” Said the voice. <br />
Tom stepped in. He was immediately confronted with a life-size mural of Jace, nude, with, guess who, Christy clinging to his side. <br />
“Well, wat do you theenk?” Said Guillaume. <br />
A million emotions were churning through Tom at that moment; envy, hatred, lust, anger, frustration, and to top it off he was starting to get a boner! Looking at Jace instead of christy didn’t help; it only made it worse! He shut his eyes. “I wish that were me” he mumbled under his breath. <br />
“Excyuseh moi?” interrupted Guillaume. <br />
“WHAT DO I THINK?!?” Tom finally erupted. <br />
“I think Jace is a lazy, arrogant, self-absorbed cock who has coasted his whole life on the looks and money his parents seem to dole out by the millions!!! I’m sick of living in his shadow, and I’m sick of him fucking me over at every opportunity he can find! He doesn’t deserve this; he doesn’t even need this!!! He just couldn’t stand that some geeky gay orphan he had made fun of once had actually made a good life for himself! I hate him, but I would do anything to be him for even a day, and now all of the sudden a painting has given him everything I’ve ever wanted twentyfold?!? How is that fair?!? Please, sir, I’m begging you; I’m not as rich as he is, but I need a portrait like this; I don’t just want it like he did. No pornography, no lewd girls performing favors, just a portrait. I don’t have the money he does, but if I need to I’m sure I can smuggle some to pay whatever I owe. But please.” <br />
Guillaume stared in confusion. Maybe he hadn’t understood. “But monsieur, why don’t you just zen buy zis one? It’s already finished!”<br />
Tom’s heart sank. “But why in the world would I want an eight foot tall oil painting of Jace stealing the girl I’ve crushed on for years looking down on me every night?!? Are you insane?!? I want a picture like this one, sure, but of ME this time!” <br />
Guillaume appeared even more confused. “Perhaps I shood bring over ze contract.” He walked over to the desk, picked up a few papers and a pen and handed them to Tom, indicating Tom should sign at the bottom. Hopeful for a second, Tom looked to see how much it would cost him; on the next page was an image of the massive painting of Jace he was currently staring at. His heart sank lower. Defeated, he signed his name on the line. <br />
“zat will be ten dollars,” said Guillaume. <br />
Ten dollars for Jace’s painting? At least he could convince Jace it cost a few thousand and make some money that way. He rummaged in his pocket and pulled out a couple of five dollar bills, uncrumpled them, and handed them to Guillaume. “Thank you Monsieur; I hope you enjoy!” He said, and signed on the line below Tom’s signature. <br />
Everything went black for a second. Tom didn’t know where he was, all he knew was that he was insanely horny. It took a couple of moments for his eyes to adjust, but then he could see; he was in an alleyway, not too far from where he had just been. Had he passed out and been dumped here? No, he was clearly standing up. Why was he so horny? He looked around and then saw her - Christy was on the ground in front of him looking shocked. “What the fuck?” She said. “How did I get down here?” <br />
Tom looked down further and saw a 13 inch cock jutting out in front of him. He staggered. Christy looked up, and then at her arms and legs. “What the fuck happened to my body?!?!?” She screamed. This woke Tom up immediately. He needed to figure out what was going on, but right now all he wanted was to shove his cock down her throat, a deep primal urge that he couldn’t resist. He felt like he was going to die if he didn’t cum right now. So he went up to her, grabbed her hair, grabbed his cock, and thrusted. It took only seconds; she passed out from the sheer impact of the gallon of seed forced down her throat. He pulled her off of his dick, a little horrified at what he had done, but he already felt horny again. He had enough clarity, though, to notice the puddle beneath them, and to see his reflection; he saw his face with a thick brown beard on a massive upper body. He stumbled, in shock. He reached into his pocket for his phone and found Jace’s phone instead. He opened the front camera and looked at himself. His face was clearly his own, but he had Jace’s body and significantly more chiseled features, with a beard to Accentuate everything. Heck, he looked like Chris Evans. While he was still processing everything, Christy woke back up. “Whoa Jace, What happ... wait, you’re not Jace. But you are.... but no, your face is totally different.  You look kinda like that Tom kid who’s gay for him or something. Who are you?”<br />
“I... I don’t know..” Tom stammered. “I gotta get outta here” and he ran toward Guillaume’s shop to figure out what had happened.</p>
