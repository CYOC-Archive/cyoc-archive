<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, okay, so the girl in the shop said you were some kind of mischief spirit. But what does that mean, exactly? I mean, what can you do, besides taking over my pal there? What does a spirit need with a body, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothin&#39; in particular. It&#39;s just more fun this way. Besides, you&#39;re the one who bought my necklace. You&#39;re the one I wanna have fun with. Your pal Michael woulda gotten in the way. Maybe later both of us can let him in on our fun, but for right now... let&#39;s stick together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek was about to bring up the fact that she hadn&#39;t answered his first question at all when she went ahead and did just that.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for what I can do? Pretty much anything related to transformation. Physical, mental, emotional, swaps, possession...anything ya want, besides reality alteration. I mean that in the sense of making this stuff fit in. I can make people think something&#39;s normal, but I can&#39;t make everyone think it is. What would be the fun in that? The chaos is the whole point!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah. So...<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis shrugged, her breasts jostling gently in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nothin&#39; much. Just a spot of fun. It&#39;s been a while, like I said. Just don&#39;t insult me, okay? I don&#39;t take kindly to no disrespect. I&#39;m more than willin&#39; to be friends with ya. Well, with anyone who&#39;s got a sense of adventure. Ya got a sense of adventure, Derek? Mike&#39;s memories tell me ya do. Remember that night in Miami?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek blanched.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can read his mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but it&#39;s more like his mind&#39;s become part of mine. We are habiting the same luscious space, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah. Okay. That made sense. Except that none of it really made sense at all. Derek felt like he was beginning to lose his grip on reality. Badly. All he&#39;d wanted was that girl&#39;s number, and now he was stuck with the leprechaun from hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I resemble that remark!&quot; Mavis shouted indignantly.<br />
<br />
Oh shit, she really could read minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, spirit here. Vague, unknowable being far beyond your mortal comprehension. &#39;Course I can take a peek behind the curtains.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek held up his hands. He wasn&#39;t sure if he really believed she could do what she said, even after she&#39;d possessed his friend. That was one thing, but the ability to reach out and reshape something with a thought... that was a power too awesome to fit into Derek&#39;s reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! Please don&#39;t kill me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis rolled her eyes, annoyed by the insinuation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told ya, I didn&#39;t kill your friend. And I&#39;m only here to have fun. No one&#39;s dying &#39;cause of me. Spirit&#39;s honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Derek breathe just a little easier. He wasn&#39;t sure he could trust her, but he didn&#39;t really have a choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t think I&#39;m letting you off the hook for that leprechaun comment. Leprechauns are filthy liars and cheaters, and I&#39;m neither. Actually, you&#39;ve just given me an idea. Maybe this&#39;ll help you loosen up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, Derek really didn&#39;t like the sound of that. He took a couple of steps back, only to find himself suddenly rooted in place. Mavis&#39; eyes were glowing blue now-- she was doing something to him!<br />
<br />
To his surprise, it didn&#39;t feel painful at all. He was expecting it to, after the way Mike had twisted and shouted while Mavis had been molding him into her. It actually felt a little bit pleasant and a little bit hazy, like standing up to your neck in water...while buzzed. His extremities felt warm and tingly. His face flushed with color as the blue glow overcame him.<br />
<br />
He really couldn&#39;t tell what was happening to him, exactly. He felt a little woozy as the asphalt of the parking lot grew closer to him. No, wait...it wasn&#39;t getting closer. He was. He was getting shorter. He had to look up at Mavis, now. Way up. Was she turning him into a kid? No, he didn&#39;t feel younger...<br />
<br />
The next few changes hit him all at once. It was like someone was pulling at his chest and rear, and his flesh was following. She was... she was giving him curves. She was turning him into a woman!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not just any woman, laddie.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to be concerned about that, but he couldn&#39;t hold the thought in his head. He looked down, right into cleavage. Two big, bouncing tits hanging right off his chest. A heat at his crotch was accompanied by a wet squelching noise and then a burst of pleasure. And then it was over. He was done. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you--&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek gasped. His voice was sweet and high pitched, and more importantly, it wasn&#39;t his. It almost sounded like--<br />
<br />
&quot;I turned ya into me, cutie. Well, not quite. More like a... mini-me. Oh, yes, your friend loves those movies. Movies. What a funny concept! So much inspiration there. The world has changed in my absence. Guess it&#39;s time to make a few changes of my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t deny it. He was really, really short now, and the curly red hair bouncing at the edge of his vision was evidence enough... not to mention his voice. And that odd, tingly feeling between his legs... whatever was down there now was definitely not what he&#39;d had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap,&quot; he chirped. &quot;Why did you make me a little person, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mavis grinned, her green eyes glinting in the midday sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to get ya back for that leprechaun comment. Matter of fact, let me finish you up. That shirt looks killer, but it might be a wee bit too big for ya right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a snap of her fingers and a wave of blue mist, his clothes rearranged in an instant. A corset tightened itself around his waist and chest at the same time that an oh-so-short skirt blossomed out from beneath it. A giant (from his perspective) green bow hung around his neck and down into his newly formed cleavage. Something wedged itself between his buttcheeks. A thong, probably, considering how the day had been going already. All-in-all, he was sure that he looked like the traditional image of a leprechaun, although he was decidedly more feminine than those storybook creatures.<br />
<br />
Her job done, Mavis clapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you look so adorable! This is just perfect. Mavis and Mini-Mavis, out on the town, looking for people to change! So, are you ready, or do you have more questions for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek raised his hands and squeaked, &quot;Oh, oh no. I&#39;m good now! We can go and do whatever you want!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was quite afraid of what else she could do to him, but part of him was beginning to think this really might end up being fun-- just as long as he didn&#39;t think too hard about it. He hefted his breasts in his hands, amazed at the way his chest lifted up in his hands. How many people got a chance to experience something like this?<br />
<br />
&quot;More now that the two of us are here. Come on, let&#39;s go somewhere fun!&quot;</p>
