<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freed looked over his shoulder to see if the lusty librarian was chasing him. He reached a corner and ran into a group of students heading the opposite way. Freed felt several similar electric jolts like before hit him from where the other students were trying to push him off.<br />
&#39;Oh no no no,&#39; Freed scrambled away from the group and darted down a hallway and into a spare room, already feeling a tingling sensation all over his body. His breath coming in rapid pants as his body began to change. The first being a tugging in the top of his head and a slow increase in weight. Luckily, Freed found a mirror and watched as a pair of easter dragon antlers grew and branched out into multiple points, at least 5 on each one as the second change started and Freed felt his dragon half begin to lengthen and narrow pushing his rear further back and his tail lengthened even more, his spine stretching painfully as he grew. By his estimate he had to be at least 12 feet long with a 6 foot long tail.<br />
&quot;Please make it stop,&quot; he prayed as two bottom canines lengthened into tusks like an orc. Two bulges under his arms pushed out and reformed into a second set of arms. His hair lengthened significantly and began to shift into a multitude of colours. &quot;Must have been a dryad in the group,&quot; he muttered to himself eyeing the hair. He felt his tongue begin to lengthen and opened his mouth to see a forked tongue slither out about a foot in length.<br />
&#39;How did this fit in my mouth?&#39;<br />
The throbbing of his twins drew his attention as precum beaded out of the tips. Freed twisted his long body to get a better view, thankful at its increased flexibility. The already crowded sheath was pushed open more as a third member pushed between the other 2. But while his previous 2 were pinkish-red and dragon like, this one was larger and deep purple in colour, the head ringed in large fleshy barbs that felt so sensitive when he touched one almost sending him over the edge. His heavy sack was pulled inside him with a painful popping sensation, they were still there, just tucked out of the way inside like a dragon. He began to tear up as he became less and less recognizable, hoping that it would soon stop as his wings involuntarily unfolded and felt them crack and break as they reformed. The top pair resembled a bat&#39;s with 3 flexible claws at the middle that Freed could manipulate somewhat like another hand, precise movement was out of the question but he could at least grasp things. The lower pair thickened as black feathers grew in like a bird&#39;s. Freed heard a knocking at the door and through the pain, shouted for them to go away, but it opened anyway to reveal the concerned librarian, top covering her breasts. &#39;I won&#39;t be able to slip past her in this room with her blocking the only exit.&#39; Ms.Char shut the door and summoned a communication window, &quot;Theodore, you need to get down here now, Mr.Gornhilde&#39;s condition is worse than we thought.&quot; &quot;Ill be there in a moment.&quot; The window shut and she stood there silently, her face showing shame as she watched Freed finish his changes as his tail formed a spade shape on the end and a third pair of horns, these ribbed like a goat or a demon, curved around his frilled ears. The underside of his dragon body shifted to a bright red colour, as his sclera shifted to a black colour, the irises a deep blue and the pupils narrowed to reptilian slits. He stood there for a few moments taking in his new form, and catching his breath as the pain faded. After a few moments Ms.Char broke the silence.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t stop myself. Someone came behind me as I was locking up the restricted section and next I saw you through a haze.&quot; She shifted on her clawed feet one human arm grabbing the other.<br />
&quot;Any idea who it was?&quot; Asked Freed trying to focus his mind on anything, so long as it wasn&#39;t what he looked like.<br />
She shook her head. &quot;No. I&#39;ll be putting in my resignation after this. It is what everyone will want after this comes to light,&quot; she began to tear up. Freed had never seen her this way before, she was one that would rage rather than sob. <br />
A flash of light and the headmaster was standing on one side of the room, arms crossed, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mr.Gornhilde has seemed to change more as he comes into contact with other creatures. At the library he was returning the Scroll when-&quot;<br />
&quot;When she came under someone else&#39;s control and as she fought it off her tail accidentally touched my hand and my lower half changed to resemble her&#39;s. After that, she ordered me to run me to run for help and I ran into a group of students. That set off these other changes,&quot; Freed motioned to his mismatch of features.<br />
&quot;Oh really,&quot; the headmaster raised an eyebrow, &quot;nothing else?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, nothing else happened, right,&quot; Freed looked over at the dragontaur, winking the eye that the headmaster couldn&#39;t see.<br />
&quot;Uhh yes, that&#39;s right,&quot; she began to tear up even more.<br />
&quot;Hmm, very well. I&#39;ll teleport you and your friends to the specialist I mentioned, he should be able to help you,&quot; he snapped  his fingers and in a flash, Freed was standing with his friends in front of an isolated tower on a far section of the school.<br />
&quot;What happens to you Freed,&quot; Eva backed off slightly in shock, as did the others to a lesser degree.<br />
&quot;Long story, we need to see whoever this is now before it gets worse,&quot; Freed knocked on the door and it swung open, pulling them all in and slamming shut behind them.</p>
