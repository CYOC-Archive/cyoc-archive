<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Enthraller.  She&#39;d never have to be raped again, unless of course she wanted to be.  Plus, the idea of ordering males around sounded lovely.   The evolution came with some free XP for the Aura Sense ability, which brought it to level 2 while transformed, and apparently that allowed her to have access to a level 1 version of it in her human form.  That was pretty nice, but she&#39;d play around with that later.<br />
<br />
For now she wanted to test out her new Refined Charm skill, but who could she use it on?<br />
<br />
Then she knew.  He was the perfect candidate.<br />
<br />
Soon she prowled through Flaremouse district, her sorceress&#39;s robe unzipped low to show off maximum cleavage, and with new self-made slits going up the sides to reveal some thigh.  Feeling sexy was different now.  It made her feel not so much vulnerable as powerful.  She may LOOK like prey to these men&#39;s eyes, but she was the predator.  <br />
<br />
Then she was there, in front of her old abode, Saldric&#39;s whore house. Saldric himself could be found lazily nursing a bottle of whiskey as he sat in a chair just outside the door, keeping an eye on his girls as they worked the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Saldric.&quot; she said as she stood before him, her words dripping venom.  Pulling up his information she saw that the half-orc was level 7, but he was all muscle without any brain or wisdom.  She could do it.<br />
<br />
Saldric looked up, and as he saw a powerful, sexy sorceress before him that he failed to recognize as Lillian, his eyes lit up.  &quot;Well, ain&#39;t you a sight for sore eyes?&quot;  he said.  &quot;and ya&#39;ve heard of me?  Well tell me what can &#39;ah do for ya miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s hard to imagine a productive use for a humanoid hemorrhoid, Smalldick.&quot;  retorted Lillian.<br />
<br />
Saldric&#39;s eyes widened in recognition.  &quot;Lillian!&quot; he proclaimed as he shot to his feet.  &quot;Why you useless whore! You think just because you&#39;ve managed to survive a few days that you can come back here acting so superior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t just survived, Saldric, I&#39;ve thrived.  I&#39;ve made quite a small fortune for myself.&quot;  At this she pulled a handful of coins from pouch and showed them off.  They were mere coppers, but she cast an illusion spell to make them look like gold.  Her illusions still sucked, but it was a small illusion and Saldric fit all the criteria for being fooled by it: drunk, greedy, stupid...<br />
<br />
Sure enough his eyes filled with avarice at the sight before she quickly put them away.  &quot;And that brings me to why I&#39;m here,&quot; said Lillian, &quot;I was thinking of starting my own brothel.  A nice snazzy place up in the Aether District.  Of course I&#39;d need some girls to start me off, and someone who knows the business.  What do you say, want to go into business with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Saldric peered at her suspiciously.  &quot;Why come to me?  We didn&#39;t exactly part on good terms, Lily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lillian decided to appeal to his ego.  &quot;Because, frankly, you&#39;re the best, and I&#39;ve learned that if you want to go anywhere in life, you need the best, and need to put any qualms you have behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; said Saldric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what,&quot; said Lillian, turning up her seductive charms to the max, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go somewhere private to discuss things?  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel more amicable if you let me make you more...comfortable?&quot;  She gave him a wink.<br />
<br />
Saldric chuckled. It was clear he lusted for her more now than before. &quot;Once a whore, always a whore. Alright Lillian, come along and step into my &quot;office.&quot;&quot;  Knowing Saldric, he might well be planning to fuck her and then still turn her down, but that was fine.  All she needed was to get him alone.  Soon they were alone, in Saldric&#39;s bedroom, which was substantially nicer than anything the girls had, but still filthy.  The orc knew nothing of hygiene.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the bed.&quot;  He commanded. The bed was filthy.  No chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think not,&quot; said Lillian.  &quot;Instead, why don&#39;t you get on the floor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not in the mood &#39;fer anything kinky or fancy, lass,&quot; said Saldric, &quot;Just get on the bed and spread &#39;em&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  You&#39;ll get on the floor, and lick it clean, asshole.&quot;  Lillian&#39;s hatred was unconcealed now.<br />
<br />
Saldric growled in anger.  &quot;Listen, bitch-&quot; he said as he dangerously stepped closer, but then she activated Refined Charm, and he froze.   <br />
<br />
&quot;You serve me now, Smalldick.&quot; said Lillian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo...&quot; groaned Saldric as blood flowed to his penis.  The bulge it made was barely noticable.  His nickname was apt.  He was resisting more than Lillian had expected, but it wouldn&#39;t last.  His lust rose and rose, and as it did, his will broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;The floor still needs cleaning, Smalldick.&quot; taunted Lillian, and then she actually hit him with a second Charm skill.   Any resistance he had was utterly obliterated and he dropped to the floor where he dutifully began to lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good dog.&quot; said Lillian. She let him go at it for a bit before asking him a question&quot;Now, your money, where do you keep it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the mattress, mistress...&quot; he said.  Lillian found quite a substantial amount of silver there, his life savings.  God, he really was a buffoon.  Then she spoke to him again.  &quot;I have one last command, my dear Smalldick.  You see I&#39;ve really grown quite tired of the beastfolk.  Would you perhaps head on over to East Flaremouse and tell all the beastfolk there what worthless trash they are?&quot;  She was giving him a suicide order, of course.  Beastfolk hated orcs, and vice versa, and East Flaremouse was solidly Beastfolk territory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, mistress.&quot; said Saldric as he rose to his feet.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and one more thing, dear?&quot; said Lillian as he headed for the door.  &quot;Do wear that orange shirt you have? It&#39;s just so handsome on you.&quot;  Orange was the gang color of a certain orc gang.  No one wore orange in East Flaremouse unless they wanted to die at the hands of a beastfolk gang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mistress&quot; Saldric droned.  Then he was gone.  Lillian smiled.  She pondered going to watch his demise, but decided against it.  Instead she walked back into the whorehouse.  There was moaning, the exaggerated fake moaning that a prostitute does as part of her performance.  When Lillian came into the backroom she saw three of her former coworkers entertaining a male who obviously had a little too much money to spend today.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...out!&quot;  She said to the male.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Lillian?&quot; asked one of the girls.  It was Ada.<br />
<br />
The male barely glanced at Lillian before returning his attention to getting his dick sucked. &quot;I paid a lot of money for this and I ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere.&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
His attitude changed when a fireball scorched the wall behind his head.  &quot;OUT!&quot; screamed Lillian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay! I&#39;m going&quot;  said the man, and soon he was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lillian, is it you?&quot; asked Ada.  &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re ok!  What have you been doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saldric is gone.  You&#39;re free, now.&quot; said Lillian.<br />
<br />
One of the other girls, Maria, looked up in fear.  &quot;What happened to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably being stabbed to death in East Flaremouse as we speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria waled. &quot;But he took care of us! Without him we&#39;ll starve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lillian looked disgusted.  &quot;He was filth who used you for his own benefit.  You can make it on your own.  If you can&#39;t, well, at least you might die able to say you tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Maria broke into hopeless sobbing, Lillian turned to leave, but then she found a hand on her shoulder.  It was Ada.  &quot;Lillian, are you ok?  You&#39;ve...changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what if I have?  I&#39;m better, stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. Look, the world is a better place without Saldric, but I&#39;m worried about you.  If you need help, tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need anyone.&quot; said Lillian, and she left.</p>
