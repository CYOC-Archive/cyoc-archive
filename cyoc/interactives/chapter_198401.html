<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom’s barges into his room to find Carly getting ready in Kelly’s clothes. “Babe, you need to be getting ready.” Carly said. “Umm, what?” Tim cautiously asked. “Babe, I know you don’t like going over to your parents for dinner but they were sweet enough to ask us. Please get ready.” Carly said in a tone Tim only recognizes with Kelly. <br />
<br />
Tim gets ready while actively looking for his watch. “Hey, Um, Carly. Have you seen my watch?” Tim asked while pulling his shirt over his head. “Oh you mean this one?” Carly mentioned while dangling it. “You went out and bought a new watch when you knew we were trying to save money? You can have it back if tonight goes well and you don’t start any arguments with your parents.” <br />
<br />
Tim begrudgingly finished getting ready and drove him and Carly to their, I mean, his parents house. Before they left the car, Carly pulled Tim in for a huge kiss and said “okay, now I’m ready” with a smile. Tim wanted to vomit at the thought of what just happened.<br />
<br />
Tim was wearing a blue long sleeve sweater shirt with jeans and tennis shoes. Carly was affixed with makeup, hair straightened, wearing a floral button up and white skirt with wedges. Tim had to admit his sister was going to be a pretty lady when she grew up. <br />
<br />
When they rang the doorbell, Tim’s dad opened the door. He was a tall man 6’3” with short dark brown hair. He was wearing a brown polo tucked into his white suit pants and his work dress shoes. His mother was dressed fairly similar to Carly with a floral button down but instead wore olive green pants and sandals. Her hair was blonde like Carly’s and freshly curled from a curling iron. <br />
<br />
Tim’s sister was still getting ready. They sat down at the table and began talking. Tim more or less just sat there thinking about the watch and seeing Kelly as Carly. That’s when Kelly entered the room. “Oh Carly, you look gorgeous.” Tim’s mom uttered. Tim turned around to see Kelly wearing a dress Carly use to wear and a denim jacket covering it. You could tell she tried to apply make up but still has a lot of practice to perfect it. Her hair was similar to Carly’s original hair and had a slight bounce to it. She quickly took her seat at the table and they began to eat.<br />
<br />
Now there is a little sister named Melissa around 5 years old that runs around but she was put to bed early. She has actually snuck out of bed and discovered the watch in Carly’s purse now sitting by the door. Melissa starts turning the dials while occasionally hitting the button. While the rest of the family ate, there were subtle waves of disorientation hitting the family but not enough for someone to mention anything. <br />
<br />
Tim looks up from his food and waxes over the family and nothing seems a miss. But now, Kelly is now in the life of Tim’s mom wearing her floral shirt while Tim’s mom Laura is now in the life of Carly. Tim’s dad had also swapped into Kelly’s life and Carly is now in the life of Tim’s dad. Carly then swapped back into her original life, Tim’s mom into Tim’s life, and Tim into his dad’s life. Tim and Kelly had finally achieved there goal of marriage unintentionally by swapping into the lives of his parents. Another large swap put Tim in his mother’s life, Kelly into Tim’s father’s life, Carly is in Kelly’s, Tim’s dad is in Carly’s, and Tim’s mom is in his. <br />
<br />
A break in swaps happened as they reached their current bodies. Another wave hit the family and everyone took on the form of the life they were in Kelly now looked exactly like the dad, Tim the mom, Carly as Kelly, dad as Carly, and mom as Tim. Next Kelly shrank to the age of Carly and reality shifted to where Kelly was Carly’s school friend rather than Tim’s girlfriend. Reality shifted again as the age of Tim’s parents dropped and Tim’s and Carly’s increased. Now tim and Carly were married. Dustin and Laura were siblings and Kelly was Laura’s friend. <br />
<br />
Reality finally shifted back to Tims parents being their normal age and Carly and Tim being siblings. Kelly was still Carly’s age. The doorbell rang and Tim now in his mothers life and physical image got up to answer “I think it’s Kelly’s mom here to pick her up” Laura said. As Laura was at the door reality shifted a few times and Kelly swapped genders and was now a 12 year old Keith. “Keith your parents are here” shouted Laura. Keith waved goodbye to Carly as he ran out the door. Carly in Keith’s body was now gone for the night. Laura came back to the table but now Susan in the life of Laura, which was Keith’s mother. A wave hit the family again and Tim and his dad were now in each other’s clothes. Tim wearing the brown polo and Tim’s dad the blue long sleeve sweater. Tim’s dad had a subtle urge to go play video games while Tim had the urge to go to bed early for chores tomorrow. Reality was setting in. Tim’s dad was a relaxed and lazy man who still played video games too much. Tim’s mom has a new look and drank too much wine. Carly who is now dating Keith, the most popular 12year old at her school is very content with life. Tim who is now the most responsible one in the family voluntarily does the chores and dresses like he’s a grown adult. He wishes he could get a girlfriend but wonders if he could find the time.</p>
