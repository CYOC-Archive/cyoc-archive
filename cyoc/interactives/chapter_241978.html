<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction as she wrote down the sentence, &quot;Ayushi has always been the stereotypical traditional Indian woman.&quot; In that instant, Ayushi, who had been standing nearby, disappeared from view entirely. Taylor paused for a moment, curious to see the shift in Ayushi’s life. After all, this was an easy opportunity to see what might happen if her family’s influence had taken complete hold—something, Taylor realized, she had only wished for before in fleeting moments.<br />
<br />
Taylor scribbled quickly in her notebook: &quot;I know everything about Ayushi’s life since high school.&quot; The knowledge hit her in a rush.<br />
<br />
High school Ayushi had been entirely different than the one Taylor had just seen. She had once been focused on chemistry, her ambitions geared toward entering a field where she could work toward her goals of academic achievement. But with the influence of her parents, that had changed drastically. In this new reality, Ayushi had never dreamed of a career. She never planned to go to graduate school. The only dreams she had were to get married and have children.<br />
<br />
Her high school years were filled with things that Taylor couldn’t help but find odd in comparison: Ayushi now spent her time cultivating the image of the traditional Indian daughter. She joined cooking clubs, spent her free time helping her mother with housework, and practiced etiquette that was more in line with her parents&#39; desires. The more Ayushi distanced herself from her earlier ambitions, the more she embraced her role—learning how to care for a home, to cook, to be attentive to the needs of men, especially those in her family’s social circle. It became more and more evident that Ayushi&#39;s true aspirations aligned with the image of the ideal &quot;traditional&quot; woman in her culture: submissive, domesticated, and focused on a family life.<br />
<br />
After graduation, Ayushi married a man chosen by her parents in an arranged marriage. She was only 18 at the time, and the union was swift, sealed with a lavish ceremony and the unquestioned support of both families. Within months, Ayushi had already fallen pregnant, and shortly after, had given birth to her first child, a healthy son. It wasn’t long before she was pregnant again—her second child arriving less than a year after the first.<br />
<br />
Now, in this new reality, Ayushi’s life revolved around raising her children. She cared for them with devotion, focusing solely on motherhood while her husband worked. This was a far cry from the determined, career-driven woman Taylor had first seen. In fact, Ayushi had completely embraced her new life. No more chemistry classes, no more dreams of engineering. She spent her days cooking, cleaning, and raising her children, fully immersed in her role as a wife and mother.<br />
<br />
The weight of her pregnancies had taken a toll on her body. Ayushi had gained significant weight, bringing her just shy of 250 pounds, her hips and thighs thickened from childbirth. She had a round, soft stomach, not the leaner figure she once had, and her breasts had swollen with the changes in her body. Her face had filled out as well, and though her features were still soft and delicate, they now carried the weight of her new role. Her clothing, once stylish and tailored, now consisted mostly of loose, comfortable dresses or sweatpants that accommodated her growing figure. She wore little makeup, and her hair was almost always tied up in a simple ponytail or bun as she moved between taking care of the children and managing the household.<br />
<br />
Ayushi’s weight was especially noticeable given her small height. At just 4&#39;11&quot;, 250 pounds made her appear almost squat, her round belly and thick thighs taking up more space than someone of her height should. It was an oppressive presence, one that now defined her physically, alongside her full face and softer features.<br />
<br />
Her energy, once focused on learning and personal achievement, was now entirely devoted to being a mother. Ayushi had very little time for herself, and what little time she did have was spent with her children, making sure they were cared for and happy. She rarely went out or engaged socially beyond the confines of her home. Any social interactions she had were usually with her extended family, who would come by to visit or help out.<br />
<br />
Now pregnant with her third child, Ayushi’s life was defined by her duties as a wife and mother. She was pampered by her husband, who doted on her and provided everything she needed. She had little to no financial struggle, as her husband’s income allowed them to live comfortably. But it came at the cost of her independence and personal fulfillment. She was no longer the ambitious student Taylor had once seen; she had become the very image of what her parents had wanted—submissive, content with her family life, and focused solely on her children.</p>
