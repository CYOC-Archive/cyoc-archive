<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan walked into the office as she unwrapped the freshly delivered package. Upon opening it she found a disk with an attachable hookup for the chronivac. It looked pretty sophisticated. &quot;Wonder who would send this to Will's uncle?&quot; She asked out load, shrugging, she figured she would at least check it out. There were no instructions but it was relatively easy to hook up.<br />
<br />
Immediately the computer sprang to life, bringing up an exact image of the mansion around her. Her eyes widened, it's like the disk over ran everything on the computer. &quot;Whoa, that's just a little freaky, it's like someone is spying on us.&quot; She went to the menu and clicked on the walk through of the program. It explained in great detail exactly what it was capable of doing. It was almost limitless from what it was telling her.<br />
<br />
Megan just laughed at what could only be some kind of a hoax. &quot;Like I'm supposed to believe that. Alright then, lets give this bad boy a whirl.&quot; She said with an amused smirk on her face. Clicking on the image of herself, she hit the modify button, thinking she knew exactly what to test out. &quot;Bunny tail, lets see you pull that one off.&quot; Laughing, she hit enter and stood up to grab herself an Iced Tea. As she walked, Megan noticed the feeling of something soft and flutter against her lower back.<br />
<br />
Her eyes grew wide with disbelief, her hands shooting to her back, groping the foreign object. Giving it a quick tug caused pain to shoot down her spine. &quot;It's fucking real!&quot; Slowly moving to the mirror, she tried to get a good look over her shoulder. A full view was blocked by her skirt, without a second though, she puller her skirt and panties, leaving her in just a blouse and heels.<br />
<br />
Looking to the mirror once more, she could now see that right above her shapely derriere was an oddly erotic looking bunny tail. Megan's mouth dropped as she slowly moved her new appendage up and down as best she could. &quot;I don't believe it, I have a tail. Will always did say I had the body of a Playboy Bunny, I don't think this is what he meant.&quot; She chuckled. The tail made her feel somewhat sexy. Then it hit her, the potential for this machine was astounding.<br />
<br />
Without wasting a minute she stripped the remainder of her clothes off, admiring her shapely sexy body in the mirror briefly. She cupped her full b-cup breasts posing sexily, she smirked. &quot;I know the first thing I'm going to improve.&quot; Giggling as she literally skipped over to the computer. Firstly, she removed the admittedly cute bunny tail, the recession felt strange as it retreated into her back. &quot;That definitely was weird. All right, time to enhance my 'assets'.&quot; Once again clicking on herself, then the modify key. <br />
<br />
The indicator listed every physical attribute in explicit detail. The slide bar popped up, her smile grew. &quot;First, a little fun.&quot; She dragged the slide bar to the left slightly, adjusting her breasts to A-cup size. Looking down, she saw immediate results, the feeling of her boobs shrinking caused a tinge of excitement to run through her body. Her hands grasped the tiny breasts, squeezing them and pinching the tiny nipples, moaning slightly. &quot;Oh, they fit so nicely in my hands now.&quot; Megan chuckled.<br />
<br />
Next, she pulled it all the way to the left, leaving her with a completely flat chest. Only her tiny erect nipples were sticking out. She flicked them. &quot;I barely remember not having breasts.&quot; Looking into the mirror her body looked strange with nothing on top, yet still she looked rather attractive. This time she pulled the bar to the somewhat to the right, not wanting to overdue it, landing on EEE, the sudden increase in frontal weight caused her to lurch forward. Megan's large mammaries almost dropped onto the computer before she regained her balance. She once more looked to her reflection, they were like torpedoes, she placed her hands on them, they were lost in the mounts of perky flesh. &quot;I could feed a small country with these girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing, Megan pulled the meter down to 34DD, as they shrunk to proper size, she posed sexily, admiring how the larger breasts accentuated her body perfectly. &quot;Better than surgery, that's for sure.&quot; Turning back to the Chronivac, she made more modifications, taking away any and all body hair on her body, say for a landing strip between her luscious thighs. &quot;No more waxing for me.&quot; She also made her face naturally perfect without need for make up. &quot;Time for a dip in the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan walked over to the closet, grabbing a bag, she reached inside and pulled out an unused bathing suit. It was more or less just thin strips of material sewn together. Pulling it up her legs, the g-string nestled neatly between the crease of her cheeks. The crotch was barely covered above her landing strip. Pulling it up further, she crisscrossed patches of material over her chest, fastening it in place. The suit fit perfectly but it did little to hide any modesty. &quot;I always knew I'd get a chance to use this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing a pair of sandals and a towel, she walked out toward the patio and sundeck. This house was built to have parties, with a hot tub, pool and bar, it was perfect. Her hips swayed seductively, allowing the rather cute gardener a peak at her shapely rear. The suit left little to the imagination. She took a seat on one of the patio chairs, she smirked, pulling out the tanning oil, she rubbed it on her stomach, chest and arms. She made herself pout adorably. &quot;Oh poo! I can't reach all the right spots. Miguel, can you be a dear and finish me off?&quot; She said rolling onto her stomach, leaving her exposed back to him. <br />
<br />
The young gardener gulped as he walked over to the beautiful boss lady. She moved her hair out of the way. For all intents and purposes, she was naked, he couldn't believe his luck. &quot;Si, Senorita!&quot; Miguel rubbed the oil all over her silky smooth, even groping her soft plump ass, she moaned playfully.<br />
<br />
Finally after what seemed like several hours, Miguel finished. She turned to face him and winked. Megan saw that little session obviously excited him very much. &quot;Thank you Miguel, that'll be all.&quot; Nodding the man quickly excused himself. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a man standing a few yards away. It startled her slightly. &quot;Will, you're home! When did you get here baby?&quot; She stood, walking over to him to give him a kiss. He stopped her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what you do all day? Oil up and flirt with the help, while I work at the office all day long?&quot; Will's anger blinded him from noticing her increased bust. Lately he'd been acting overly protective and very volatile toward Megan. Seeing her like that didn't help matters much. &quot;You women don't know how easy you have it!&quot; He said storming off to his private study.<br />
<br />
Megan was fuming now, she loved Will more than anything and would never hurt him. She was just teasing that guy. The fact that he thought she could pissed her off. Grabbing her robe, she walked back into the mansion and toward the office. &quot;Time for some fun with Willie.&quot;</p>
