<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony and Claire couldn't be any closer, but through an amazing set of circumstances, still hadn't made love, not as the real Tony and Claire.  Tony hesitantly told her of having made love to her when he was stretched to a ridiculous 7'5&quot; tall and Claire was a bit upset.  Tony told her he'd had other opportunities, when he was black, for instance and hadn't taken advantage but that he'd been overwhelmed with affection for her.  She slowly lost her anger at him over this, but a weekend was lost to them.  <br />
<br />
Two other opportunities were lost when once Claire's mother and another time her aunt suddenly showed up at the Heath household unannounced purely by chance just as Tony and Claire were kissing and groping and only minutes from consummating their love.  Once Mark walked in on them as preliminaries of affection were just finishing and ruined the mood for them.  Another weekend, Claire was out of her mind with desire for him but Tony spent it as a wolf along with Mark, Jack, Jeff and Eric as they went after another den of coyotes that had been preying on cats and small dogs in town.<br />
<br />
More opportunities were lost due to Tony playing for the high school baseball team.  Tony was the starting centerfielder and also pitched for the team.  He loved playing baseball and was a star with the body he'd designed.  But between practices and games, Tony and Claire were separated scores more afternoons.  For her part, Claire had huge chunks of her time taken up by her work for the school paper.  Circumstances large and small conspired against them.<br />
<br />
It was while working at home on an article for the paper that an idea for getting them what they both wanted ocurred to her.  She had heard dozenes of annoying phone messages left for her mother by a time share resort in Orlando, Florida.  The messages were all the same.  You've won a free week at blahbittyblah resort with no catches.  Her mother and father had no intention of going to be pitched timeshare membership.  And they were too honest to accept the free week if they knew they were going to say no.  As Claire typed away at her article on tracking in the high school's division of classes, she noticed a mailing from blahbittyblah resort.  <br />
<br />
That's when it ocurred to her.  She could go with Tony.  She could go with Tony, and they would &quot;age&quot; themselves enough to not be 16 years old and go through the pitch.  Then they would change back to themselves and enjoy a free week making love at the resort.  They would have to get down to Orlando, somehow, but it was a good plan.  She pitched the idea to Tony. <br />
<br />
Tony thought it was a terrific idea.  They'd go the week of spring vacation and finally have time alone, hell, a whole week alone.  He even had a solution to her problem of transportation though he wouldn't tell her what it was right away.  From Tony's room, she called the 1-800 number on the flyer and told the resort salesman who answered when she and her husband Tony would be there.  She gave biographical information on them, some true of her parents, some not.  She gave their age as 24.  They were both so happy, they might have made love right then but Cindy was downstairs screeching that it was Tony's turn to do the dishes and that the trash had to be taken out, a chore that had somehow become his sole province.<br />
<br />
They were due at the resort Saturday morning.  They left school at lunch time with Claire's now Chronivac loaded laptop and Jeff's spare emitter.  They ran to Tony's house and pulled their already packed bags from his closet and dragged them out to the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; demanded Claire &quot;so what's this solution to our transportation problem that you've been so secretive about?&quot;<br />
Tony laughed and gestured to himself.<br />
&quot;You were one fine horse, but even Tony the Arabian horse cannot ride all the way down to Orlando&quot;<br />
&quot;Just turn on the laptop&quot; <br />
Claire did as she was told.<br />
&quot;Now go to the Chronivac program and to my profile&quot; said Tony as he pulled off his shirt.  <br />
&quot;Uh huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you see there, alternate profile number 9, I think it is?&quot; he asked as he glanced around to see if anyone could see him on their driveway and then pulled off his shoes, socks and pants to stand naked on the asphalt.  <br />
&quot;It's a car.  You-you want me to turn you into a car?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not just any car, a '64 Ford AC Cobra with a 427 side oiler engine.  The greatest stock sports car ever available to the public&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire looked up and smirked at the sight of his beautiful body naked in broad daylight there, but glancing around, saw no one else who could see it.<br />
&quot;I'll have a full tank of gas and you can just ride me down to Orlando.  We'll get there in no time.  You'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Claire a minute to adjust to the idea, but what other option did they have?  Tony gave her a few pointers in going through the program and then returned to the middle of the driveway.  Claire pointed the emitter at him and pressed 'enter'.<br />
<br />
Tony felt the familiar electric wave pass through him and immediately fell forward onto his hands.  He felt his body simultaneously enlarging, becoming almost completely metallic and dividing into thousands of discrete parts.  Claire watched in amazment as Tony's buns turned into a rear bumper and roughly where his rectum had been, a tailpipe now stuck out of Tony.  His hands turned into chrome rims and tires as did his feet.  His eyes spread 3 feet apart and became headlights and his nose and mouth became a grill.  The changes were coming increasingly fast, though and in just a few seconds, she saw the rest of Tony's body re-form into a beautiful convertible sports car, navy blue with two white racing stripes across the hood.  He was an exact duplicate of the picture on hte laptop screen.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're really Tony?&quot; asked Claire.  The car horn went off without her being anywhere near the steering wheel.  She laughed.<br />
&quot;You can hear me?  If you can, beep three times for yes&quot;  The car horn beeped three times.  She laughed.<br />
&quot;Are you completely you in there?  I mean, mentally?  This time give me four beeps for a yes&quot;  The car horn beeped four times.  Claire laughed and tossed their bags in . . Tony.  It was difficult to adjust to thinking like that but as she got into the driver's seat, she knew she was sitting on some part of Tony and the bags on the seat beside her were also somehow on Tony.  She turned the ignition.  The powerful engine came to life and then purred wiht the promise of fantastic acceleration.  Claire shook her head trying to consider all aspects of it.  That engine is part of . . Tony.  She shifted and hit the gas.  The car rocketed forward.  She soon discovered that Tony was much faster than her parents' cars.  They were like golf carts compared to Tony.  She made her way quickly to the interstate and started toward Orlando, passing every car on the road.  And she made another discovery, by accident, by almost getting into an accident.  She had followed behind a mini-van for almost a mile, waiting for the mini-van to move over to the middle lane.  Finally, she turned the '64 Ford AC Cobra over to the middle lane to go around the van.  She was thought she could just squeeze in ahead of the van and was turning the wheel that way when the car in th middle lane in front of her suddenly hit its brakes.  But instead of a crash from trying to squeeze into an opening that had closed, Claire felt the wheel whip to the right and the car accelerate, moving to the slow lane and a gap there.  Next, the car zigged back to the middle lane and then the fast lane before accelerating to over 120 mph and leaving all the other cars way behind.<br />
&quot;Tony?!  Did you just do that?&quot;  The car beeped three times, the signal for yes on which she'd settled.  Not only was Tony watching and aware the whole time.  But that night, after gasing up her boyfriend, Claire caught up on her sleep while Tony drove himself down the interstate at 120 miles an hour.  Twice, he roared past speed traps and cruisers came peeling out after him.  Tony turned off his lights and pulled off the highway at the first available ramp and out of sight.  Each time, he waited 10 minutes and then roared back onto the highway, again at 120 mph.<br />
<br />
Early the next morning, Claire woke to find herself in a beautiful sports car zooming down in interstate in Florida.  She grabbed the wheel and saw a driver to her right staring at her, his jaw almost on the floor mat.  She realized how bizarre it must have looked, her asleep yet this sports car zooming past everyone.  She put both hands on the wheel and her foot on the brake, slowing Tony to a still fastest car on the road 80 mph.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, she turned off a side street and pulled into the resort.  She had to check in with a security guard before entering.  He barely checked off her name on his clipboard and didn't pay any attention to her words about her husband coming along later.  He was completely fascinated by Tony.  The guard circled around the '64 Ford AC Cobra twice.  He whistled and remarked about what a beautiful car she had.  Claire just smiled and patted the wheel.  She drove around the complex, a series of condominium townhouses arrayed around pools, a health club, walking trails and luxurious landscaping.  Finally, she found a relatively secluded area, an extension of a parking area that was empty but for one other parked car.  It wasn't even far from the unit for which the guard had given her the keys.  She parked Tony in the least visible spot and then removed their bags.  She reached into his bag and removed some clothes.  She reached into her bag and removed her laptop and the emitter.  She very carefully turned it on and went through the chronivac menus.  She set it to change Tony back to his human self except that he would be 24 years old.  At last finished, she anxiously hit the 'enter' key.  <br />
<br />
Tony felt a faint electric current pass through his huge metal body and immediately started changing.  To Claire it was like watching a super speed change of one of the cartoon Transformers.  One moment, he was a car.  A few seconds later, Tony stood naked before her, looking exactly as he had in the driveway except perhaps a few pounds of muscle heavier.  She realized she was staring because Tony raised an eyebrow looking at her.  &quot;Quick!&quot; he half whispered.  &quot;Oh . . yeah&quot; she said and tossed him his clothes.  They were his 16 year old's clothes, but they still fit him just fine.  <br />
<br />
Claire asked him a bunch of questions about being an object but Tony was blase about it.  He'd been a statue.  He'd been a mannequin.  This was positively fun compared to that.  Besides, Tony was more interested in the differences between his 16 year old and htis 24 year old body.  His arms and shoulders were just a bit more muscular.  Same wiht his legs.  He guessed that he was 171 pounds now, up from 167 as a 16 year old.  <br />
<br />
He didn't ponder it long, though.  As agreed, he took the chronivac and turned it on Claire changing her from 16 to 24 years old.  He marveled at the almost complete lack of change in her appearance.  Maybe her cheeks had slightly less natural blush.  Maybe her small round breasts were ever so slightly larger.  He examined her luscious round rear with scientific precision and decided it looked exactly the same.  <br />
<br />
They grabbed their bags and walked side against side to their townhouse.  They had just a few minutes to get to the conference center on one side of the resort.  They walked into the air conditioned, rooms, all detailed with cut glass and carved wood and were fawned over.  There were five other couples getting the pitch from the blahbittyblah resort and about 3 employees, salesmen, assistants and lordly managers per couple.  Tony and Claire were already flush with the prospect of excitement.  They were in a terrific mood.  The help positively fawned over model Tony and beautiful Claire.  It had been a while since Tony had remembered getting that much attention from men.  But a couple of the salesmen talking to other couples and the husband of the couple talking at the next table over couldn't seem to take their eyes off him.  The female assistant helping the salesman talking to Tony and Claire openly gawked.  Claire squeezed Tony's hand and whispered in his ear &quot;Everyone in the room wants to fuck you&quot;.  Tony rolled his eyes.  But it was true.  When their salesman gave them a tour of the grounds, the female assistant and the sales manager came along.  Again, despite his beautiful girlfriend, even the men watched only Tony.  When it came to showing them the pool, sauna and health club, they put all their questions and comments to Tony.<br />
&quot;You look like a man who could appreciate a good sauna Mr. Heath.  You'll find birch branches, water and ladle outside and plenty of seating always ready here.&quot;<br />
&quot;You must be a lap swimmer Mr. Heath.  You've got that swimmer shape.  Is that how you keep in shape?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you bench Mr. Heath?  225?  250?&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Tony felt like they wanted to ask him for a date as much as try to sell him and Claire on a timeshare.  When the pitch was finally over and Tony and Claire stood up and thanked the employees but declined, it seemed to Clair as though they were hurt by the rejection, however polite, from dream boy, Tony.<br />
<br />
Out of sight outside the building and down a couple twists of the resort paths, Claire laughed.  &quot;I'm jealous!  I'm actually jealous of you.  This is ridiculous.  You'd think they'd never seen a gorgeous guy before&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony just chuckled.  When they got back to their unit, they immediately went to the chronivac.  Tony changed Claire back to her 16 year old self.  The program had run a bit rough, each step taking a bit longer to execute than it should have, but soon enough, Claire was back to her 16 year old self.  Claire asked to do the work to change him and Tony stepped back.  It took her even longer to perform what should have been a very simple operation.  Take his present profile and restore him to his registered profile.  She grimaced and cursed at the computer for taking so long.<br />
&quot;Hey, maybe we should wait&quot; said Tony taking a step toward the laptop to see what was wrong and just as he did, he felt the electric wave pass through him.  But he didn't lose just 4 pounds of muscle.  Tony stood there in shock as he became shorter than Claire.<br />
&quot;What the he-hell?&quot; His voice cracked with the last word.  His clothes drooped ridiculously on him now.  His pants and shorts dropped to his ankles.  His hands were lost somewhere in his sleeves well short of the cuff and he stepped right out of his shoes.  His watch fell to the floor with a clunk.  His perspective kept dropping till his eyes were about breast high on Claire.  He felt his body reshape a bit and lose muscle.  His eyes went wide and he pressed his drooping dress shirt to his crotch to confirm what he'd felt.  His balls had ascended back into his body cavity and his penis had shrunk dramatically.  Tony was a 10 year old boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell just happened?&quot; he demanded and tripped as he tried to step forward to see the computer.  He angrily pulled everything off himself and stood there naked next to Claire staring at the computer screen.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You did run those anti-spyware programs I told you about, didn't you?&quot;</p>
