<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary decided that her best plan was just to borrow Max for a little while.  After all, John said he owed her for her help.  But what excuse could she use for borrowing Max?  She knew that he would not let Max go without a good reason?<br />
<br />
Mary paced the room anxiously as she thought.  Without noticing, she was walking on the balls her feet, as it felt easier and more natural.  <br />
<br />
Of course, she thought, dogs like Max are used for protection.  She could request Max&#39;s help in protecting her, possibly from an abusive ex-boyfriend.  Mary&#39;s stubby tail began to wag in excitement.  She quickly redressed, struggling to cover her long feet with thick socks.  She knew shoes would be impossible to wear, but since he just lived down the hall she did not think John would question their absence.  Mary knocked loudly on John&#39;s door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello, &quot; he said.  &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you so soon.  Sorry, I haven&#39;t had time to clean&quot;.   Mary could smell the strong odor of dogs emanating from the room, but it did not seem to bother her. In fact, it smelled a little interesting to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sorry this is not a social call. I&#39;m afraid I need to call in that favor, and I need Max&#39;s help, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max&#39;s help? &quot;said John, with a look of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I have been having problems with an old boyfriend.  I was hoping I could use Max to scare him off,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot;said John.  &quot;Max is not really an attack dog, and I really have just begun his training.  I think it would be better if I went over there with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, its not like that, &quot; she said.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to have Max attack him.  He&#39;s not violent or anything.  But he just won&#39;t leave me alone. He has a fear of dogs, and I thought if he heard Max barking he would think I now owned a dog, and he wouldn&#39;t come over anymore.  I think if you confronted him, it would just aggravate the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
John still looked concerned.  Max moved to the door, and at the sight of Mary, began to wag his tail excitedly.  He pushed past John, and began to nuzzle Mary&#39;s hand. Mary leaned over to pet him on the head, and he licked her on the face a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please&quot; , said Mary. &quot;It should only be for a few hours.  He usually comes by around this time, and I will take Max back as soon as he leaves.  I promise I won&#39;t let Max hurt him; I&#39;m not even going to open the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
John thought this was a bad idea; but there was just something intriguing about the girl, and Max really seemed to get along with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, &quot; he said. &quot;But just for a short while.  Take my cell phone number, and give me a call if there are any problems.  I might need to stop by my office in the afternoon, but I can get back here pretty quickly if you need me.  And please, don&#39;t open the door.  I don&#39;t want you or Max to get hurt.&quot; John handed Mary his business card with his cell phone number.  He put a leash on Max, and handed it to Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary thanked him profusely, and headed back to her apartment.  Such a cute girl, thought John.  But its odd that I didn&#39;t notice her harelip before.   There was a pronounced dip in her philtrum, very similar to the appearance of a dog&#39;s mouth.  He shook his head, clearly his thoughts, and returned to his work in his apartment.<br />
<br />
As Mary entered her apartment, she could hardly contain her excitement.  And neither could Max.  He jumped and pulled on the leash, making it difficult for Mary to control him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy boy, easy, &quot; she said.   She detached the leash from the collar and he began to explore the room, smelling everything.  When he reached the box on the coffee table, she shooed him away.  &quot;Not for you, Max, &quot;she said with a smile.  Max nuzzled her hand, and began to lick it eagerly.  <br />
<br />
	Mary pulled her hand away.  &quot;Not just yet.&quot;  She quickly prepared for her transformation.  She opened the box, and placed the &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;Human&quot; vials on the coffee table.  She removed her socks with difficulty, as the cloth continued to get caught on her curved toenails.  She considered removing her dress, but felt a little uncomfortable getting nude in front of the animal. <br />
<br />
Mary did not want to become a full dog, but she decided that she just wanted to become more dog-like.  She was having so much fun, but she still wanted to experience more.  She thought half of the vial would get her the results she wanted.  She uncorked the vial, and drank half of the solution.  &quot;Okay Max, come here. I need your help, then we can play, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
Max jumped up and ran over to his friend and began to lick her hand.  Mary was surprised to feel the changes begin almost immediately.  As she watched, the fur on her arms began to grow and thicken, spreading to other parts of her body.  Her small breasts flattened against her expanding chest.  Her hands lengthened, as thick pads began to form on the palms of her hands and the tips of her fingers.   Her feet lengthened even more, and her big toe receded into a dew claw.  The change in her feet caused her to fall to the floor with a laugh.<br />
<br />
	Max stopped licking and examined Mary, a little confused.  She seemed different to him.  She smelled different.  He got closer and began to sniff her body.  Mary didn&#39;t notice.  She was too preoccupied with the pain in her face, as her jaw lengthened and narrowed into a muzzle.  She was trying to stand again, when Max suddenly jumped on top of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, boy, off, &quot;she said,  with difficulty.  But Max refused to yield. &quot;Heel, Max, Heel, &quot; she said, almost shouting. But Max refused to yield, pinning her as he explored her body, sniffing and licking.  Mary felt her body continue to change, and began to get a little frightened.  She was changing more than she had expected, and Max was behaving very oddly.<br />
<br />
Mary tried to push Max away, but found it more and more difficult as the changes continued.  Finally, she batted him in the nose and he retreated with a whimper.  Now that Max was off her, Mary regained her footing and stood up.  The change made it difficult to stand erect, and she adopted a hunched posture.  Even at this position, Max still seemed large and imposing.  She looked at her coffee table, and noted that it too seemed large.  Of course, she thought.  Dogs are smaller than humans, I&#39;m shrinking to match his height.  For the moment she was taller, but her new body was awkward and difficult to control.  She feared Max could easily overpower her if he desired.  As if on cue, Max turned to face her and growled softly. He did not appear to be the friendly dog she first met.  She did not know if he saw her as a rival or something more.<br />
<br />
I think I&#39;ve had enough of this, thought Mary, as he reached for  the &quot;Human&quot; vial.  She grabbed the vial and opened it. The pads on Mary&#39;s hands were slippery, however,  and she couldn&#39;t hold it.  She dropped the vial, spilling its contents onto the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, &quot;said Mary, in a gravelly voice.  As the changes continued, it was getting more difficult to form words normally.  Max seemed to sense her desperation, and began to slowly advance.  It seemed to Mary that he smiled as he came closer.  He knows he has the power now, thought Mary with fright.  She quickly grabbed as many vials as she could from the box, cradling them in the remnant of her sundress,  and ran to bathroom.<br />
Max slammed into the door just as she managed to close it.<br />
<br />
Mary sat on the floor, and began to cry softly.  She had just wanted a little fun, not to be some animal&#39;s plaything.  She could still feel herself changing, but she dared not look in the mirror.  She could her Max panting, and could sense that he was waiting just outside the door for her.<br />
<br />
Mary steeled her nerves and examined her options.  She had brought some vials with her but she had no idea what the vials could do.  Maybe one of them could reverse the changes.  She looked in the corner of the bathroom and saw her cell phone.  She had left it in the bathroom, and Max probably knocked it off the counter when he hit the door.  She still had John&#39;s number somewhere in her dress.  It would be hard to explain, but maybe he could help her control Max.  She wasn&#39;t sure what to do, but she knew she had to do it soon.  Time was running out.</p>
