<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan nervously tried to hide his bobbing erection behind his larger hands. He was thankful, somewhat, for the <br />
enhancement but wished he didn't have to deal with the embarrassment. &quot;Hey, Kevin, uh, could you fix this?&quot; he <br />
asked. The last few words meekly trickled out of his mouth as he saw the look the tall, multi-armed jock was <br />
giving him. It was almost hungry, carnal. He shivered, creeped out, but strangely his cock didn't seem to be <br />
getting soft.<br />
<br />
'What's going on?' he wondered. His eyes shifted to Gwen, who was breathing a bit heavily and seemed to be <br />
trying to keep her eyes off of anyone. She was definitely pretty, and her voice... Bryan took a half step <br />
toward her just remembering the sweet sound of it and how it filled him with fire. A gasp from Kevin snapped <br />
him from his thoughts and he turned back to his partner, momentarily forgetting to cover himself. His cock <br />
thrust out toward the changing man.<br />
<br />
Kevin's skin seemed duller somehow, maybe even a little grey. It was also quite itchy and he scratched at it, <br />
but that wasn't what made him gasp. It was his chest, his pecs more specifically. They had already softened <br />
during his last change but they were now swelling outward. His skin stretched uncomfortably tight against the <br />
swelling mass as breasts pushed their way out of his chest. Even the skin of his nipples seemed to be <br />
stretching, though nothing outside of the shape was changing. The pressure was uncomfortable, bordering on <br />
painful, and at last he reached up to touch them. As his fingers brushed the stretched skin there was a <br />
tearing sound and the pressure was gone. Pieces of skin fell away from his breasts, revealing large, C cup <br />
globes covered in short yellow bristles. His nipples were dark black, like his bug arms, and shaped like small <br />
black spikes.<br />
<br />
As Kevin took in his changes, still scratching at his dry, dull skin in patches, his changes were continuing. <br />
It was almost as if they were reacting to his thoughts, or his change to Bryan. When Kevin had enhanced <br />
Bryan's dick he had been enhancing his primary gender characteristic. In turn, Kevin's own gender <br />
characteristics were being enhanced though not for the gender he had been. They matched the gender he was <br />
becoming.<br />
<br />
His penis was shrinking even as his breasts were growing and stretching his chest skin. As it retracted into <br />
his body it grew darker and the skin of his shaft became a glossy black. His testicles pulled up into his body <br />
and shifted, becoming another two hard, round shapes in his swollen belly awaiting fertilization. Kevin's <br />
penis became curved and pointed, drawing in close to her crotch and becoming a sharp barb. Just behind it a <br />
slit appeared and opened into a dark, bristly hole. A thick fluid wet the inner ridges of her new insect <br />
vagina to provide lubrication both for mating and for the eggs inside of her. Instinctively Kevin seemed to <br />
know that her barb, what used to be her penis, would prick a male when trying to mate with her and drive him <br />
into a sexual frenzy that would ensure fertilization as he ejaculated all of his male seed into her, leaving <br />
behind a subservient, female drone who would then do as she wished.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Gwen panted then took a deep breath, trying to center herself. She kept her eyes lowered, focusing on her <br />
glossy black claws rather than the temptation of the two changing teens in front of her. This game, changing <br />
Stacy and Bryan into attractive, popular versions of themselves, was just whetting her appetite. She clenched <br />
her sharp teeth as the thought of a muscular, studly Bryan and a sexpot Stacy invaded her mind and made her <br />
warm in her crotch and hungry underneath it all. She couldn't seem to stop thinking about it entirely, but she <br />
forced herself to concentrate on something unattractive, like their hair or their beady eyes or something.<br />
<br />
'Pull yourself together, Gwen!' she thought to herself. She couldn't give in and make an absurd change, not <br />
before Kevin, and lose. There was no telling what would happen if she lost. She might change completely into <br />
this horrid bird-bitch she was becoming and her dreams for the future would be gone forever.<br />
<br />
Still gritting her teeth, Gwen looked up at Stacy. Her eyes went immediately to her bursting bust and how it <br />
was ready to pop out of her top. She wrenched her gaze somewhere else and found herself looking at where <br />
Stacy's crotch was hiding under her princess gown. Absently she wondered if the sexy leg transformation had <br />
carried to her pussy and made it sexier too. Gwen licked her lips for a moment, trying to think of a way she <br />
could find out, when her common sense returned again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she said in her honeyed voice. Stacy's nipples poked out of her top and to the side Bryan and Kevin <br />
visibly shivered. Gwen quickly tried to focus and stared determinedly at Gwen's face. She blinked and cast her <br />
spell, forcing herself to keep watching and see it through without getting lost in daydreams about other parts <br />
lower down or the thick, erect cock Bryan was sporting nearby.<br />
<br />
Stacy, for her part, felt a tingling in her own mouth that spread outward to her lips. She reached up to touch <br />
them and felt a wave of pleasure as her fingers brushed the now sensitive skin. Her lips were plumper, <br />
thicker. They had swollen up into plump, cock-sucking proportions. They were made to slide over something hard <br />
and long, like a finger or a fat cock, or sucking on something like a nipple or a clit. Stacy felt the urge to <br />
lick her lips with her tongue, which also felt different. As she slid it forth, she realized what it was. Her <br />
tongue was longer than normal, and slightly pointed, much like a certain famous rock star. It felt like heaven <br />
against her new, thick lips.<br />
<br />
Kylie noticed and smirked. &quot;That's pushing it a little bit, Gwen, but I think it still counts. She'll be <br />
really popular with the boys now, won't she? And some of the ladies.&quot; The witch gave Gwen a knowing look. <br />
Gwen, for her part, braced herself as she felt the brush of magic sweep over her.</p>
