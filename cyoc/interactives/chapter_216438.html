<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas left a naked Mark asleep on the bed, not sure when he fell asleep as she milked his cock dry. Thomas found Cal and Scott in the pool, but they were encased by their symbiotes from head to toe.<br />
<br />
Thomas asked, &quot;Someday, I&#39;ll figure out how you both do that.&quot; Thomas felt her own flesh change she was now covered from neck to toe.<br />
<br />
The three swam for a while, doing laps, and then just hanging out at the bottom of the pool, sitting around one of the lights at the deep end. Thomas didn&#39;t know why, but she rather enjoyed being able to breath both air and water, there was no fear of drowning. Thomas was lost in thought when she felt something try to enter her vagina. Looking down, Thomas saw two black streams, one from Scott and the other from Cal. Thomas watched as the streams seemed to flow into her, and she could feel something making it&#39;s way deeper inside her. The stream stopped from Scott and Cal, while the remainder found it&#39;s way into Thomas. Thomas looked at the two and put her hands up in a waving motion. Cal pointed to the surface, and then swam to the deep end ladder with Scott following behind. Thomas waited for a while, she felt what was inside her stop moving, then she joined the two at the ladder.<br />
<br />
Cal and Scott were breathing in air now and clearing their lungs of the last of the water. Their bodies were only encased from the neck down at this point. Thomas kept her nose under water, not wanting to switch to air just yet. Cal touched Thomas&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;We got an idea...what if we three combined a piece of ourselves and see if it will create a fourth inside you. Scott and I have tried this on a smaller level with the two of us, but the hybrid does not live long and we just reabsorb it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas waited a moment, thinking, then slowly swam to the ladder to hold onto while she cleared her lungs of water. It took a few breaths, and some coughing, but Thomas was curious and asked, &quot;You&#39;ve done this before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott nodded, &quot;We think you are the missing piece. If it works, it might accept Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas was already thinking that, and nodded yes to Scott. Thomas asked, &quot;So, what do I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal shrugged, while Scott reached over and took Thomas&#39;s encased arm and said, &quot;Close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas felt Scott&#39;s grip then Cal&#39;s grip on her opposite side thigh. Soon, Thomas could feel her symbiote, and it was her, but yet it wasn&#39;t. She was moving something that was not an arm or leg, but felt like a finger. The finger grew and soon was at the entrance to her own vagina, then inside, and going deeper. Soon, the finger was with the other streams from Scott and Cal. Thomas felt her finger absorb the two strings and felt the finger tingle before going numb and then Thomas could not feel it anymore. That is when Scott and Cal both released their grip on Thomas, and Scott said, &quot;Okay, open your eyes now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas asked, &quot;It didn&#39;t work, did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott looked at Cal, then to Thomas, &quot;Probably not&quot; he said. Scott continued after another glance to Cal, &quot;The tingling is something we didn&#39;t have before...but that numbness is when our test samples stopped moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three sat in silence for a bit, then Scott and Cal fully encased themselves and sat touching Thomas on both sides. Thomas could feel them, they were talking, but she could not understand the words. Cal&#39;s encased hand reached up to swipe down Thomas&#39;s face causing Thomas to close her eyes, and that&#39;s when she hear the words in unison from Scott and Cal, &quot;Thomas, can you hear us, can you hear us.....testing testing....can you hear us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas smiled, and said &quot;Yes, I hear you&quot; aloud.<br />
<br />
Thomas heard Cal in her head, &quot;Finally....at least you can hear now. This is really handy underwater.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon, the three were back at the bottom of the deep end around the light, sitting and holding the hands of the other two. Scott and Cal felt Thomas enclose her full head for the first time, though she was trying to speak when she did that. Cal and Scott make the most of a speechless Thomas, poking good fun at their queen. Thomas felt Cal&#39;s and Scott&#39;s feelings about her, each other, and Mark. Thomas didn&#39;t manage to speak any words, but she did manage to express her feelings about the three. Thomas felt a jolt from the two. &quot;That shut them up,&quot; Thomas thought.<br />
<br />
Cal felt happiness and so did Scott, &quot;We hear that,&quot; was heard in near unison from the two by Thomas.<br />
<br />
Thomas tried to talk more...but it didn&#39;t matter, she instead felt and conveyed her emotions that she felt along with the desire to milk the three of them along with being the best breeder she could be.<br />
<br />
Cal and Scott shared how they felt with Thomas and each other. All three were present together, sharing themselves opening for the first time. Thomas could feel how much Scott loved Mark as his best friend and how much he loved Cal, and how much both loved her. After a long while, Scott and Cal carried Thomas to the shallow end of the pool, and were concerned she was still completely encased. Scott and Cal cleared their lungs after reforming themselves to cover just the skin below the neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thomas, can you open your eyes?&quot; asked Cal.<br />
<br />
Cal felt Thomas trying to speak, but heard nothing. Cal and Scott did not let go of Thomas&#39;s hands, as they were both worried. Then Thomas felt the worry and she got worried. Thomas was trying everything she could think of to control her symbiote...then felt something from Cal and Scott....she was the symbiote, they were one. Scott and Cal rested Thomas&#39;s body on the bottom of the shallow end. They were committed to stay with their queen, as she realized the human mind vs symbiote was over long ago...and she was the merged soul of both. Mark was awake and joined them, holding watch over Thomas. The three remained as the sun started to light up the sky, then past sunrise.<br />
<br />
Thomas was lost in her own mind. Where, what part was human, control? Thomas was in an endless cycle of doubt, denial, and disbelief. The question of what is real was very much an issue. It was past noon when Thomas sat up, and cleared her lungs of water while remaining encased. &quot;Thank you all,&quot; Thomas said. The three watched as the symbiote flesh was seemingly absorbed into Thomas&#39;s skin. Thomas did several more tests, a one piece suit, a set of swim shorts, full swim leggings, and full encasement minus her face.<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;Thank you&quot; to Scott and Cal where only they could hear since they were still holding her hands. Thomas&#39;s understanding of the joining was finally complete. Thomas was hungry, and went over to grab Mark&#39;s cock, &quot;May I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stepped over to the hand rail, then nodded to Thomas who swallowed his dick whole, and felt Scott take Mark&#39;s rear entrance for himself. Cal found Thomas&#39;s ass for himself. Cal could feel the sensations of Mark&#39;s cock deep in Thomas&#39;s throat...&quot;finally&quot; he thought.</p>
