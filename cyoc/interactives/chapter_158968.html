<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;By your leave, my king.&quot; You inform Riefclaw of your choice even as you choose to depart. You see the smile on his face as you bow and back out of the room.<br />
<br />
Behind you, you can hear Jargus begin speaking. &quot;I have two solutions to the issue of continued population, my king. One is to allow a controlled population of humans to remain, the other is a potion that can allow two men who so wish it to..&quot; The rest of the mage&#39;s words are cut off as the doors to the throne room close behind you. <br />
<br />
You feel rooted in place, standing there long enough that the fox knight speaks a concerned sounding, &quot;General?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question snaps you out of your haze and you look to the two guards. &quot;Where is Prince Yuriv?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should be in his quarters.&quot; The gorilla gives you some directions, and with a nod of thanks you head off in that direction. It does feel good to be in charge, and you&#39;ve not had to fight anyone for that, they just accept it because that is the way it is. The king says it&#39;s so, and it&#39;s so. No one is challenging you because of age or experience, you&#39;re just the general. You think on the bear, Drale, for a moment. The life long soldier. He might make a good second, you&#39;ll need experience around you if you&#39;re going to do this. You also wonder what it might be like to take that hard muscular rump of his, spreading his cheeks and slowly sliding you cock..<br />
<br />
You shake your head, clearing the thoughts. Maybe Riefclaw is right, you don&#39;t have much resistance left. Every beastman you pass in the hall on the way to Yuriv becomes a small perverted fantasy in your head, especially the otter that walks by wearing nothing but a gauzy film of a scarf around his waist. You actually have to stop yourself turning in place and grabbing him to press up against the wall. You want to dominate every beastman in sight. Except when your thoughts move to Yuriv or Riefclaw, the only two where it seems natural to submit, especially Yuriv.<br />
<br />
You come to the doors and find two guards on either side, one is a very familiar looking wolf, the other is a floppy-eared dog of some sort. You meet eyes with the wolf. There&#39;s a connection between the two of you, one you know will have to be worked out sooner or later.<br />
<br />
&quot;The prince has been expecting you.&quot; The dog says with vibrant enthusiasm. &quot;Said to let you in right away.&quot; He pushes the door open, as one more look passes between you and the wolf and you head inside.<br />
<br />
The sight of Yuriv takes your breath away. You keep picturing your lean, thief of a stag in your mind. Not this majestic, muscular demigod of the woods. You&#39;re sure your mental image will adjust eventually, but it&#39;s still a bit of a shock. For the moment he stands completely nude over a table full of maps, gently stroking at his cock as another man might stroke at his chin in thought. But when he turns to see who it is that smile is just the same as it was, mischievous and eager. The door clicks closed behind you leaving the two of you alone.<br />
<br />
His smile turns to a bit of a frown when he sees the amulet around your neck. &quot;Are you here to say goodbye?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here to ask a question.&quot; You fold your arms tightly across your chest to keep from reaching out to the prince. &quot;What kind of king will you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good one I hope. I want a place for all in my kingdom. I was looking at the map and we have quite a bit of unused land. We could have villages of humans, as along as they promised to obey land&#39;s laws. Any that wished to join us we would accept. Perhaps laws to convert criminals and troublemakers, too, to maintain the peace. I&#39;d even give the human villages fair representation on the council.&quot; He does seem to be putting a lot of thought into this, and while Riefclaw&#39;s method still strikes you as overzealous, this one.. This is one you could live with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; There was no need to ask what would happen to beastman troublemakers. There wouldn&#39;t be any, they&#39;d follow orders, even orders to leave unwilling humans alone. Such was the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; Yuriv seems confused by the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise me you will be kind and moderate, like you&#39;re planning, and I&#39;ll stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv looks over at you, shaking his head but sporting a brilliant smile. &quot;You&#39;re a wonder, anyone else would have given in days ago and you still hold on. You&#39;re a strong one, Nate. I promise, as much for my soul as for your conscience. I need to do this right.&quot;<br />
<br />
With those words you take off the amulet and toss it aside. &quot;Then I&#39;ll stay. So, is there any sort of.. ceremony or?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv shakes his head again as his thick arms wrap around you. &quot;Just give in and let go.&quot; He pulls you over to the giant bed, gently pushing at your chest so you fall back on the sheets. &quot;This might feel a bit odd at first, but it&#39;s worth it.&quot; He kneels down at the end of the bed and you can feel something warm and thick pressing against your rear. His tongue penetrating you and flicking around inside of you. You grip the sheets under you as little growls of pleasure escape your muzzle.<br />
<br />
And you let go. The last of your worries and the last of the human you resisting what you want. It feels like fire surging through you, similar in a way to Yuriv completing your transformation, but somewhat different. Yuriv stands and presses the head of his erect cock against your tongue moistened hole, waiting for you to nod before pushing inside. He has to take it slowly, he&#39;s bigger than he was before, and there a bit of pain mixed in with the pleasure of being filled.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s slow and gentle. Oddly, you feel the sheets of the bed shifting beneath you. No. You&#39;re shifting on top of them. You&#39;re getting bigger. Each muscle in your body beginning to pop and swell, your chest expanding, shoulders and arms filling with strength, new power flowing through your legs. You meet your gaze with Yuriv, who looks pleased at the changes overcoming you. &quot;Lords.. that feels..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing?&quot; Yuriv finishes for you. He&#39;s thrusting in again, and as you grow in size, each thrust gets easier, more pleasurable. You want to grab at your own cock, but you feel as if letting go of the bed would send you falling into the sky. Your fur begins taking on a sheen. Not the golden color of Yuriv and Riefclaw, you&#39;re still a seas of stormy gray and black, but with silver mixed in, almost glittering against your darker fur tones. You know any beast other than the golden kings would happily fall in line for you.<br />
<br />
Your cock throbs and swells with a power of its own, With a roar your arch your back and spill your seed, some splashing onto your furry muscular chest, more falling on the sheets, a bit hits your muzzle which you quickly lap up. Your stag seems pushed by your pleasure, and soon you feel a heat flooding your insides, making you feel full and content.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Yuriv lays on the bed next to you, lapping your chest clean with his tongue. &quot;You&#39;re going to be quite the general and prince-consort. Everyone&#39;s going to be jealous of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv laughs at the confused look on your face and helps you to your feet. Even standing you can tell you&#39;re taller and stronger. Will Yuriv still overtops you it&#39;s not by as much, you gaze now level with his shoulders rather than below his pecs where it was before. He guides you over to a mirror, and gestures.<br />
<br />
The silver mixed in your fur gives the feeling of a night sky, and your muscles are firm and large, thick with both strength and youth. Though your feline form still gave the look of lean grace. Not anyone you would want to face in a fight. You&#39;re more than certain you&#39;re larger than Drale and Jargus now, meaning only Yuriv and Riefclaw were bigger. Some beastfolk seemed to put a lot of stock in size, and you were certainly one of the largest in the kingdom.<br />
<br />
Yuriv runs his hands over your chest, cupping your pectorals with a grin as he nibbles at your neck. &quot;Now we can get really rough in bed.&quot; That&#39;s all the invitation you need and both of you are soon back on the bed, entwined with each other again as you let out days of pent up horniness and frustration.  Every time you resisted touching each other made up for with another round of lovemaking, until you both fall asleep, sweaty and reeking of sex.<br />
<br />
When you wake up you&#39;re pressed up against Yuriv&#39;s side, his arm holding you to him and your head resting on his firm pectoral. The light coming in from the window speaks of early dawn, right before the sun comes up. Well before you&#39;d normally be up, no, something woke you up.</p>
