<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A knock on the door beckoned Jordan as he walked over. He opened it to see their neighbor Toby staring in. <br />
<br />
“Well?” Toby said. He had on his backpack and the like and was beckoning outwards. “We have class dumbass.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s right!” Jordan exclaimed. He’s forgotten about class, and now somewhat about the pill he’d just taken. He grabbed his backpack waved bye to the fuming Hugo. <br />
<br />
On their way to class, they passed by a soccer field where two teams were playing without shirts despite it being fall. Jordan was torn from the field by Toby who pulled him into a building. <br />
<br />
The two guys only had one class for the day. It was a discussion based class with no real curriculum. An easy elective. <br />
<br />
As they took their seats, the class filed in, a small class of about 30. <br />
<br />
Their teacher, Mr. Lance, was a very young guy, must have been fresh out of college. He was short and a bit thin but never lacking in enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
“Ok class,” Mr. Lance said clapping his hands together. “We’re going to be continuing with our actuvity from yesterday to better understand each other. We’ll start with Mel. What does everyone think Mel was like at age 12? Y’all to your partner about it.”<br />
<br />
Jordan breathed a sigh of relief. It was this activity. Mr. Lance would go around and everyone would have to say what they were like at an age range of 10-13. Prior to this, the class would have to guess what they were like. It was easy, nothing too hard. <br />
<br />
“I bet she was some nerd into books or something,” Toby said to Jordan. <br />
<br />
“Nah,” Jordan said becoming engrossed in the class. He had forgotten about the power of his voice. “I bet that she was more of a tomboy.”<br />
<br />
“Ok Mel,” Mr. Lance said. “How were you at a age 12?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Mel described. “I was a bit of a tomboy actually.”<br />
<br />
Again forgetting his control over words, Jordan grew excited that he had guessed it successfully. <br />
<br />
“Next we’ll do Anna,” Mr. Lance said pointing at Mel’s partner. “After that we’ll go to Toby and Jordan. So Anna, let’s hear abooout...age 13.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely in a punk rock band,” Toby said. <br />
<br />
“You’re just pulling things out of your ass Toby,” Jordan said. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Toby said somewhat angrily to him. “It’s a condition, I can’t help it.”<br />
<br />
Jordan stated at him. Why has he called out like that. All of a sudden, Toby slightly pulled his pants down and jammed his hand up his butt. He pulled out a greed bouncy ball that was surprisingly clean.<br />
<br />
“Well Anna?”<br />
<br />
“I think I was really into Physics around then,” she said shrugging her shoulders. <br />
<br />
Jordan has a flash of remembrance. The pill. The words. Toby. <br />
<br />
“Ok Toby,” Mr. Lance said. “Let’s have everyone guess about you at age 11.”<br />
<br />
“Ok wise guy,” Toby said turning to his partner. “What do you think I was at age 10?”<br />
<br />
Jordan felt a sense of giddyness. He could change Toby right now and not feel awkward. He thought carefully before responding. <br />
<br />
“Because of your immense size at the moment,” Jordan started. “Combine with your current attire, I bet that you were too tall and too muscular to fit into anything other than tight boxer shorts at age ten and that’s why you’ve only ever worn them.”<br />
<br />
“Damn it Jordan,” Toby said annoyed. His shirt looked a bit tight at he moment. “How is it that you knew that age ten was the exact age?”<br />
<br />
Toby’s shirt tore down the sleeves as biceps emerged from his new tank top. <br />
<br />
“Like I guess you could have figured it out, I don’t think I ever told you why though.”<br />
<br />
Toby’s shirt tore through a seam down the middle starting from the neck as Toby expanded outwards. His taught chest exposed his pecs and the torn shirt exposed his mountainous abs. <br />
<br />
“You really are something Jordan.”<br />
<br />
Toby’s shoes were next. A very faint rip of laces as his shoes cave undone from the inside as his feet expanded. Toby had simply turned to face Jordan before, but now his feet had covered Jordan’s and had pushed him backwards. <br />
<br />
“You just have a knack for always being right, it’s amazing.”<br />
<br />
As his feet stretched, so too did his legs. Muscles ripped out of his jeans as denim fabric littered the floor. Quite literally his waist expanded outwards. The waist of his jeans held strong and were almost engulfed in the muscle. But alas, the belt’s leather tore like paper and the jeans snapped like a whip. <br />
<br />
And there Toby sat. In nothing but a pair of tight grey camo boxers. He had a bulge in the center that under normal circumstances for anyone else would’ve looked like a tent. <br />
<br />
“Toby,” Mr. Lance said. “Can you answer about age 10?”<br />
<br />
Toby stood up. He must have been double his normal height. At least 10 feet. His hulking body engulfed the shared desk that they had. <br />
<br />
“At age ten I had grown too big for any clothes aside from XXL size boxer shorts and so that’s when I started only wearing these.”<br />
<br />
Toby motion toward his midsection. Curious, Jordan muttered that Toby was turned on at the moment. He added that no one would notice or care in order to not embarrass him. On cue, his bulge expanded outwards to at least a foot and a half. <br />
<br />
“That explains a lot Toby,” Mr. Lance said nodding. “Thank you.”<br />
<br />
Toby sat down, his dick smacking against the table as he did so. He sat there taking up most of the space. <br />
<br />
“Ok class,” Mr. Lance said. “I want you to guess what Jordan was like at age...we’ll do 10 again.”<br />
<br />
“So little man,” Toby said turning to Jordan. “What were YOU like at age 10?”</p>
