<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> When the clock struck 8, Jake jumped up off of the bed.  He had made it.  He resisted temptation, and had refrained from having sex with Gina.  And now he could switch back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, it&#39;s time.  We can switch back now.  Where is the medallion? &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go, &quot; said Gina, as she tossed a plastic bag to Jake.  He reached into the bag, and pulled out the medallion.  Jake realized that Gina must have placed it into a bag to avoid any other unfortunate accidents.  &quot;And here you go!&quot; said Gina excitedly, as she tossed a shoe at Jake.  Jake caught the shoe reflexively, and felt the familiar tingle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, Gina?  What is this?&quot; said Jake, holding up the large shoe.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that?  It was a shoe I never got a chance to wear.  We have to make a special order for my custom shoes over the internet, and by the time it got here I had already outgrown them.  But hopefully they will fit me real soon, &quot; said Gina with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, we were supposed to switch back, &quot; said Jake angrily, as he tossed the shoe to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will.  But I wanted to change my body a little bit before we did.  I have always hated being so tall, and I am not going to pass up this chance to get a little shorter.  Those shoes should make me a few inches shorter, then we can trade bodies.  Don&#39;t worry.  I have thought of everything.  Today, I will get just a little shorter, not enough for people to notice.  Then tomorrow, I will shrink myself another few inches.  Eventually, I will be a normal height, and everyone will just think I had some weird kind of reverse growth spurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about me?&quot; whined Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, don&#39;t worry.  As soon as you finish shrinking, we will just touch the medallion together and swap bodies.  See, I told you.  I thought of everything,&quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed. He could feel himself slowly shrinking, and realized that there was no use worrying about it now.  He had no choice.  He was going to change into a shorter version of Gina whether he liked it or not.  After 30 minutes, Jake didn&#39;t feel like he was changing anymore.  Gina&#39;s clothes hung loosely on his body.  With excitement, Gina beckoned him forward so she could measure him.<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;2&quot;.  Looks like I will be 3 inches shorter now.  Just perfect, &quot; said Gina happily.<br />
<br />
Jake looked in the mirror.  He was an exact copy of Gina, just shorter now. Gina stared at this reflection over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, &quot; said Gina. &quot;Maybe I should work on my bust, too.  Nothing too big, but I could use a little more up top.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake stamped his foot angrily.  &quot;You can do that to your own body.  It&#39;s time to switch back, &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay. Don&#39;t get your panties in a wad, &quot; said Gina with a grin.  Jake did not appreciate her humor and frowned.  Gina sighed and picked up the medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you don&#39;t want to fool around?  This might be your last chance for a wild ride,&quot; asked Gina with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jake reached forward, grabbing the medallion and Gina&#39;s hand.  She felt the familiar shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, pooh, &quot; she said as she pouted.  Her whole body felt strange.  She began to stretch taller, Jake&#39;s clothes growing tight around her body.  &quot;Better get out of these - you will need them to get home, &quot; said Gina as she undressed. Jake blushed at her nudity.  He was a little surprised he felt that way.  It was his body after all.  But not for long.  As she continued to grow taller, her hips became wider and her waist became thinner and flatter.  Her face was the last to change, and she covered it with her hands as it shifted back to her female appearance.  All Jake could see was her hair, as it grew longer and drifted down to cover her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that was intense, &quot; said Gina, as she removed her hands to reveal a face identical to Jake&#39;s.  And that was when Jake finally realized that something was wrong.  Jake had been so engrossed by Gina&#39;s change that he failed to notice that he was not changing, too.  Instead, there were now two identical shorter Ginas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh, &quot; said Gina, as she stared at Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh, is right.  What the hell went wrong? &quot;asked Jake angrily.<br />
<br />
Gina bounded over to the computer to review her notes.  She paled when she found her mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jake, I&#39;m sorry. It says that you can use it every twelve hours.  I thought I could use it on you to change something on my old body, then use it on me to swap bodies. You know, get two changes for the price of one time period. But apparently it doesn&#39;t work that way.  If you change anything, you must be stuck that way for twelve hours regardless of how you use it with other people, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, just great.  So I am stuck like this for another 12 hours?  What the hell am I supposed to do?  I mean, I can&#39;t go home like this.  Where can I go?&quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s eyes lit up.  &quot;You just stay here.  As long as anyone in my family doesn&#39;t see us together, they will just think that you are me.  We will just have to take turns using the bathroom, and stuff.  You can change back to yourself in the morning.  Trust me, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake did most assuredly did not trust Gina, especially after her latest mistake.  But she was right - what other choice did he have?  Jake sighed, and nodded his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
Gina squealed in excitement.  &quot;That&#39;s great!  I have always wanted a sister, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake scowled.  &quot;This is only temporary, remember?  Besides, I thought you already had a little sister. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Brin the brat?  That little shrimp.  We have nothing in common.  We might as well not be related.  But you are exactly like me.  We have much more in common, and it will be so much easier to relate to you and share my problems, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is only temporary, right?&quot; said Jake firmly.<br />
<br />
Gina pouted.  &quot;I know, I know.  But at least tonight it will be like I had the sister I always wanted.  I mean, you know what it is like.  Tell me all about your day, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake decided to tell her about it.  It had been miserable, and for some reason it felt good to share with her.  Gina eagerly hung on his every word, and even added a few antidotes about her own experiences as a tall girl.  Gina looked up at the clock, and was surprised to see how late it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it&#39;s pretty late.  I think we better get to bed, &quot; said Gina, as she stood up and walked into her closet.  She pulled out two long nightgowns.  &quot;Which one would you like?  This one is prettier, but I like the feel of this fabric better.  You are the guest, it is your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina handed him the nightgown, but he paused before he got undressed to change clothes.  For some reason it felt wrong to get nude in front of Gina.  Gina laughed, as she quickly took off her own clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, relax. It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen it all before.  It is my body after all, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake still felt uncomfortable, and quickly pulled on the nightgown.  He looked up to see Gina already in her large bed.  Jake sighed, and started to lay down on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what are you doing?  There is plenty of room in here.  I won&#39;t bite, I promise, &quot; she said, as she patted the bed beside her.<br />
<br />
Jake crawled into her bed, and lay beside her staring at the wall with Gina to his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. what about your parents?  Shouldn&#39;t they be worried about you? &quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, &quot; said Gina.  &quot;They work late, and they won&#39;t be home for a while.  I usually eat dinner on my own.  Just in case, I locked the door.&quot;    <br />
<br />
Gina snuggled up to his back.  &quot;You know, my offer still stands.  If you want to fool around, I&#39;m still game, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake just pulled away from Gina, and used the sheets to create a barrier between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;In your dreams, &quot; said Jake, as he began to drift off to sleep, exhausted after a long day.<br />
<br />
Gina sighed, and also drifted off to sleep, still snuggling up against him.</p>
