<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unbeknown to Elizabeth, when Chronivac adjusted reality it took all the settings and tried to normalize them globally. Since Herbert was changed into a dog and his profile still listed him as her husband and sexual partner, it changed the whole world and human history to normalize the marriage between a dog and human, and made dogs sentient to compensate.<br />
<br />
More than that, Chronivac counted down precious seconds left until her mind completely adjusted to her new life.<br />
<br />
7 MINUTES 10 SECONDS<br />
<br />
Elizabeth played with Herbert, impressed that he followed every command perfectly. He seemed to understand exactly what she wanted. And even appeared to smile when she called him cute names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Bertie, you&#39;ve been such a lousy human but you&#39;re an amazing dog.&quot;She said as the dog looked at her confused but assumed the claim to be a part of some silly talk and smiled again.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth looked around the room. What she initially thought to be a doggy bed seemed to be weirdly huge, almost as if it was built for more than a dog to sleep in. She suddenly had an urge to lay down in it. She found it just the right size and the softness combined with musky smell made her feel safe and comfortable.<br />
<br />
Taking that as a sign, Herbert moved in closer, lying in bed next to her and licking her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, stop it. You know I prefer your licks after we do it.&quot; Her heart dropped as the images of &quot;it&quot;  they would do popped in her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second, no, I&#39;d never. Not with a dog... Would I?&quot; She said confused, as Herbert thought she tried rollplaying again and took that as a sign to make his first move. <br />
<br />
He bit into her pants and took them and her underwear off, with the agility of someone who have done this hundreds of times.<br />
<br />
6 MINUTES 2 SECONDS<br />
<br />
As he started eating her out, she got out of bed shocked and ran towards the Chronivac &quot;Whatever I did made it all wrong. I&#39;m starting to enjoy it and if I don&#39;t do something now I&#39;ll be stuck eating his red hot steamy doggy cock and getting to snort his addicting musk for the rest...&quot; She barely caught herself thinking that last part. This was bad.<br />
<br />
Herbert followed her thinking this was one of their many sex games they loved to play. He wouldn&#39;t disappoint his wife by letting her get away. He knew how she liked it.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t follow me you stud.&quot; She said seductively as her brain tried to accommodate 2  versions of her, one with desperate need to revert all this and one that made her pussy juice drip behind her at the thought of soon getting speared by a thick dog rod.<br />
<br />
She got to the kitchen where the computer now stood just to see the timer go from 4 MINUTES to 3 MINUTES 59 SECONDS. Seeing the profile information her heart sunk as at once she understood exactly what went wrong.<br />
<br />
Just then Herbert ran into the room, barely dodging the fridge as he always did, that&#39;s what she loved about him, that eagerness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna do me on the kitchen table, darling?&quot; She didn&#39;t have much choice but allow him to do her, she could undo it all while they screwed, at least that&#39;s what her dog obsessed mind came up with as a compromise between the shreds of her old self and overwhelming horniness of the new.<br />
<br />
She turned away from Herbert and towards the screen, 3 MINUTES 20 SECONDS to undo it all, that&#39;s fine, just a few clicks, she can do it, right?<br />
<br />
She reached for the mouse and clicked on Herbert&#39;s profile. &quot;What am I doing again? Oh right, we were playing on the table.&quot; She thought as she let go off the mouse. &quot;Wait, no. I have to fix this.&quot; She fought with herself as Herbert moved in for the kill.<br />
<br />
He moved his head under her ass and started circling her hole with his slick, wet tongue. Teasing her pussy with his steamy breath.<br />
<br />
All of Elizabeth&#39;s willpower disappeared at once as Herbert found something even her old self couldn&#39;t rebel against. She moaned and arched her back with eyes closed and hands gripping the edge of the table, holding for dear life as his saliva dripped and mixed with her female cum and sweat. Herbert continued eating her ass, slobbering and lapping at her hole, forcing it open as it twitched and winked, begging for more. His tongue ventured into her ass, slithering inside with globules of saliva as he enjoyed her scent and peculiar taste.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth knew she had to do something, there was a vague air of wrongness in the room. As she opened her eyes she looked at the timer.<br />
<br />
1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS<br />
<br />
In a moment of extreme clarity she grabbed mouse and keyboard.<br />
<br />
And threw both of them onto the ground to make space for their fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t take it anymore. Knot me like the horny bitch you know I am!&quot; She laid flat on the table in front of the computer as Herbert inserted his pleasure rocket into her lubricated hole. She pushed against his dick unable to form any coherent thought that didn&#39;t have streams of thick doggy butter associated with it. She wanted his cum so bad. She wanted him to mark her so nobody else can ever claim her. She loved him so much.<br />
<br />
The knot entered her ass with a plop as Elizabeth and Herbert orgasmed together. Her juice dripped down into a pool of saliva and doggy cum. She shouted and squeaked as the pleasure hit her like a train. Her body shivering in the aftershocks of pleasures that still coursed through her body.<br />
<br />
He ruined her ass once again and she couldn&#39;t do anything to stop herself. She loved pretending she was above having filthy dog sex, that must be why she resisted his advances a few moments ago, it adds so much more spice to the already intoxicating idea of being used like an animal. And the connection they had was just so sublime.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must&#39;ve been really pent up, Herbert. This weird timer barely finished counting 4 minutes when we came.&quot;<br />
<br />
They breathed heavily as the sound of cum droplets hitting the ground marked another incredible session of sex. &quot;Pull out, I wanna taste it.&quot; He complied and slid his still semi-hard as a cupful of sperm splashed across their already soiled tiles. He sucked and licked the copious amount that was still in her ass, savoring the taste and moved in for the kiss. They shared a long kiss as they both fought to swallow as much of Herbert&#39;s seed as each could. Him out of instinct and her out of insatiable need. She simply loved feeling his canines with her tongue, it was so intimate. Eventually she pulled out, her face dripping with cum and dog spit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love being your doggie cum dump, baby. I almost wish you could knock me up for real.&quot; She seductively exclaimed &quot;That&#39;s pretty much why I bought us this transformation computer. It can do anything.&quot; she finished as Herbert lovingly licked his cock juice off her face.<br />
<br />
She looked at the parts she threw in the heat of the moment. &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t damage anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a test she breathed out in relief as it still worked perfectly. &quot;We could always buy another one, but I&#39;d rather give it a spin this instant. Now. Would you like a second round with me as a real dog. Or is there anything else you&#39;d like to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Herbert looked away from licking his tip and stared into space.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;d be happy with anything, but. We just did my roleplay and you catered specifically to my ass play fetish. I&#39;d feel awful if you didn&#39;t get a turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m getting wet again just imagining all  the kinky shit you could do with my body. I know you&#39;re a pervert too. I&#39;m not even going to look, promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
She moved away to let him choose.</p>
