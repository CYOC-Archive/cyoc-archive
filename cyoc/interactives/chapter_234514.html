<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Flash<br />
Flash<br />
Flash<br />
Flash</b><br />
<br />
I blinked once or twice as the flash cleared. Much better than last time this happened. I looked down at myself and I recognize I was 12 years old. I was wearing an orange shirt and surprisingly some hard rock flames swimsuit. I looked around in my surroundings and it turns out I was still outside.<br />
<br />
However it was different from when we were all 5 to 10 years old, there was literally little of us that was playing on the playground. Instead it looked like one massive pool party, that would explain why I’m wearing swim trunks now. Some of the party goers were jumping in the pool or swimming in it. What surprise me the most is that it seems that Mrs. Brockman had her maid staff dress up in one piece bathing suits and act as the lifeguards for this party.<br />
<br />
I smiled as I saw a 19-year-old Monique sitting in a lifeguard chair wearing a red one piece bathing suit. It hugged her curves correctly, but restricted her bust (which is now C-cups) a bit but I didn’t mind. She spotted me and waved at me and I waved back in response. However, I noticed a figure waving to me hard and I gave a disappointed sigh. It was Nadia, she was wearing a two-piece bathing suit and just say it was more revealing was an understatement.<br />
<br />
Her bust were unrestricted in the bikini top look like it did very little to covered them. One of the things about the swimsuit that stood out was the frills on both the top and bottom of the bikini. I just didn’t respond and turn around to leave until I noticed something odd. It looked like 12 year old Ashley talking to 12 year old boy or at least I think it was a boy. He didn’t look like much, and he was wearing a plain green swim trunks so I’ll curiosity I step closer to them.<br />
<br />
“Come on Hugh it is not that bad.” Said Ashley wearing a one piece bathing suit that was black with white spots. It seems that she was trying to coax the boy to join the party. Okay this is way out of character for Ashley; granted she was not above trying to seduce any type of guy as long as she got something from it but basically help a boy with something? That was odd maybe her being the stepsister to Bessie was more of a positive influence than I thought.<br />
<br />
“Oh I don’t know you know I’m very insecure about my locks. Even my family says that I was a pathetic looking boy.” Hugh said causing Ashley put both her hands on his shoulders getting his attention.<br />
<br />
“Listen, big boy I know you want to go to puberty in the next couple months, but you cannot hope to attract girls if you don’t interact with them.” Ashley said. This is the second time I had to do a double take because this was different compared to I normally expect from Ashley. If I recall correctly, Hugh was surprisingly the less Manley guy in our age group even when we were 17. It was almost as if all the jeans that makes a man stand out was always checked off, and he stood in the background, in shame of his appearance.<br />
<br />
“So what? What if the other girls take notice of me? I just be happy if it’s just one girl took an interest in me.” Hugh said.<br />
<br />
“Even if that one girl would be just me?” Ashley asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah if it was just you and your sister, then I would be happy that you’re my friends maybe more.” Hugh responded.<br />
<br />
“Even so you will need to still build up your social skills. That way you can try to learn to keep me if we ever became anything more.” Said Ashley as she dragged Hugh to the pool.<br />
<br />
“Fat chance I can keep you as a girlfriend with my looks.” Hugh said as they pass me. I smiled because as I recall a Hugh; he was the wimpiest man I have ever met. Perhaps one of my tricks when we returned 17 is making Hugh a prime example of a man at this party. Satisfied when I was seeing I head inside the mansion.<br />
<br />
As I silently walked through the mansion, I entered the living room and stopped noticing that a group of eight 13 year old girls (no doubt, future high school seniors) were sitting in a group. I silently got closer to listen on their conversation.<br />
<br />
“Can you believe that Mrs. Brockman invites us here every year for Brad‘s birthday party?” Said the girl that I remember is Kimberly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it was nice to get to know each other before we entered high school.” Said the girl that I remember is Wilma. Okay so they do have privacy so they can technically speak their mind. This is the first time anyone was discussing what was happening instead of living out our lives.<br />
<br />
“Uh it ain’t that special.” The girl I remembered as Chell spoke only to be punch in the shoulder by a girl I knew was named Samantha.<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself it was nice, especially since you know I’m an orphan.” Samantha said in a somber tone.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, good thing you were orphan, and we were two years old when this whole thing started.” Said a blonde girl I knew was named Gina. “Imagine how embarrassing it would’ve been is after that flash and we were all nursing from our mom‘s titties like some of those juniors, sophomores, or freshman. We not to mention you Samantha got lucky.” Ugg such vile language for someone their age to be speaking.<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself girls I didn’t have a mother. I was just drop off as a newborn so I don’t know what that feeling is like.” Samantha said in an annoyed tongue.<br />
<br />
“Oh maybe when we’re 18 again maybe I’ll let you suck on my titties.” Chell said with a chuckle only to be punch again by Gina.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Samantha, I know this must be hard.” The girl I knew was Sally said an apology.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay you know sometimes I’m would’ve mind to have adopted by one of the maids here.” Said Samantha, all the girls looked at her before all of them except the one that I know is named Matilda start laughing. “It’s not funny. Did you see the two that have children in the freshman class?” With that they stopped laughing.<br />
<br />
“So hypothetical speaking, if you were adopted by one of the mates, which one would you want to be adopted by?” Asked Matilda.<br />
<br />
“The head maid.” Answer Samantha.<br />
<br />
“The Korean?” Asked Wilma.<br />
<br />
“No that’s Ha-rin. I’m talking about the Japanese Natsumi.” Said Samantha indignity.<br />
<br />
“Good but continuing your line of thought I can see that. I wanna mind being adopted by Ha-rin.” Said Wilma.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that German girl would’ve made a good mother.” Said Gina.<br />
<br />
“That South American maid I wouldn’t mind being her daughter.” Said Matilda.<br />
<br />
“You four are weird.” Chell said with Kimberly, Sally, and the girl I knew as Amanda nodding in agreement. I stepped away into the hallway as I contemplate at what I just over here. Four white girls who didn’t mind being other races and being the adopted daughters, maybe biological daughters of the oldest maids here. I can work that into a trick once we return to our proper ages.<br />
<br />
Before I conclude in my thoughts, someone grabbed me and slammed me against the wall. I blinked once and noticed that there were two hands and arms next to my head in a pinning maneuver as I looked into the face of my attacker.<br />
<br />
“Nadia, what the heck are you doing?” I asked as I recognize the 19-year-old Nadia who is now pinning me against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Just trying to one up my twin.” Nadia said in a seductive tone. I looked at her confusion before she continued. “One of things I liked about my relationship with Monique is that due to being twins (besides our parents) is that no one could tell us apart. It was always great satisfaction that I trick people and took something that was meant for Monique, even if it was for a short time or perhaps long time maybe forever.” And she took a breath and look at me as a she was lovestruck.<br />
<br />
“Except you came along even as a baby you could tell the difference between me and Monique. That what makes you attractive to me, every time I have been to these birthday parties, you have spur any attempts of practically anything with you. I mean, who wouldn’t your attractive heck even my own sister has a crush on you.” Nadia said but that got me to smile.<br />
<br />
“Monique likes me?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes and I guess you like her back that makes you a forbidden fruit to me. Well now I’m going to take my bite out of it.” Nadia said as she close her eyes and moved her face close puckering up for a kiss. I clinch my right fist as I was about to make a silent wish when all of a sudden two pairs of hands grabbed Narnia shoulders and arms before pulling her off of me and slamming her against the wall opposite of me.<br />
<br />
I blink to see the head maid Natsumi and the maid Ha-rin having Nadia restrain. Then Mrs. Brockman stood in front of her, and Nadia started the panic.<br />
<br />
“Mrs. Brockman! I…” Nadia try to say.<br />
<br />
<b><i>SMACK</i></b><br />
<br />
Mrs. Brockman slap Nadia in the face.<br />
<br />
“HOW. DARE. YOU?” Mrs. Brockman angrily said. “ 11 years ago I invited your parents who were visiting the US to my sons first birthday party and since then our families have been friends. Now, one of you have tried to force yourself on someone who is literally younger than you.”<br />
<br />
<b><i>SMACK</i></b><br />
<br />
Mrs. Brockman smacked Nadia again before Nadia could say anything in respond.<br />
<br />
“You try to ruin something that me and your parents, as well as Joey’s parents have worked so hard!” Mrs. Brockman said. I decided to ignore that as she continued. “You confine your room until you and your sister go home to France.” With that the two maids dragged Nadia off. Mrs. Brockman took a breath before turning to address me.<br />
<br />
“Joey, are you okay?” Mrs. Brockman asked and I nodded my head.<br />
<br />
“Yeah no bruises but how?” I asked. <br />
<br />
“Ever since you started this whole thing I’ve had one affair under my roof and my maid staff 11 years ago raped. I had to step up in order to incidents like that to happen again. Monique witness you had inside and her twin sister falling suits. She had a bad feeling and informed me.”  Mrs. Brockman said. <br />
<br />
“Thank you now I think it’s time we just fast-forward this party. Don’t you think?” I asked and Mrs. Brockman nodded in response. I mentally made the wish to fast-forward to the next birthday party.</p>
