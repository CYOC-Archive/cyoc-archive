<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author's notes, please have the meeting with the father go smoothly if you will.  And <br />
leave who Leticia really loves more ambiguous for now, I've realized a perfect climax for <br />
this story.)<br />
<br />
Juanita let them be for a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Jasmine, or rather, 'Vixen', took one look at the contracts, reading them over, getting a <br />
headache just from read them. Electronic schematics at least tried to make sense. A seven <br />
year commitment. &quot;Say good-bye to our new teenage years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike, or rather, Sage, read the contract over thoroughly. &quot;They would be spent with you... <br />
so I can't say they're going to waste. From the looks of things, this could be almost <br />
considered a Zoo transfer if we were four legs. They aren't kidding about us being isolated <br />
from society until the contract expires. At least there's no extension sub-clause they can <br />
smack us with to trap us even longer. But they do give us enough breathing room for <br />
humans like Laura will be to see us on invite. In short they can't turn down people who will <br />
want to visit us. And it seems someone went to trouble to word it so we -could- send out <br />
an invite for people to see us. Laura should be able to handle anything you own. Anything <br />
I own will be put in secured storage via contractor. Can't say I like not being there myself, <br />
but it's not like they're giving us a choice. If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't have minded in <br />
the least going back to how I was with just a few good memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regrets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To tell the truth, I was actually kinda hoping we'd end up doing things normal teenagers <br />
do... but looks like that fantasy can't come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look a gift horse in the mouth Vixen. They're holding most of the cards. I think I can <br />
screw with the wording here a little though so we can have some more real life contact if I <br />
word it right. However in the end we're still going to be tied to the new park effectively.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything in there about us being 'transfered' away from each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None. Looks like they knew who they were playing. We're going to be legally tied to the <br />
same park. Plus since NONE of the genetic modifications are on the books, and since the <br />
park itself is filed under recreations, we can't call it medical treatment. In short, they're <br />
deciding where we live, our new teen years, and the first couple of new adult years, will be <br />
spent inside the park as it slowly expands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vixen seemed rather dejected, but this was, like it or not, Mike's area of expertise, &quot;So you <br />
think we should take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew you and your mother would have to effectively start a new life... I was actually <br />
looking foreword to seeing the faces of some of my chess mates. Given our options, I have <br />
to say, this is our best one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot;  <br />
<br />
To decide, to divide one's possibilities and to eliminate one of said possibilities. Jasmine <br />
saw all the possible future she could have with Mike and her mother... and knew they were <br />
all about to vanish except one. So be it. <br />
<br />
The two foxes let Juanita know they were ready, and with one last hesitation on Vixen's <br />
part, the two signed their names. <br />
<br />
Laura gave Mike and Jasmine one last hug in her fox form before entering the <br />
transformation room. The fur all but vanished everywhere except her head, her tail shrunk <br />
into her spine, her face was pressed flat, her sense of smell became muted, her teeth <br />
became able to handle more than dead flesh of animals. Her feet became flat while her <br />
claws became fingernails. Her ears became round and moved to the sides of her head. Her <br />
inside becoming primate rather than canine. She felt dizzy, odd, more naked than naked, <br />
she shuffled out of the transformation room and was given a bathrobe, for the first time in <br />
months actually THINKING of herself as naked. <br />
<br />
She gave Jasmine a second hug, her first hug, she and her daughter now separated by a <br />
species barrier. And an interest thought occurred to her. <br />
<br />
'Heh. Hannah, if you had still been a male, I wonder if you would been a decent father for <br />
Jasmine. Oh well. Doesn't matter. I'll be the human on this side who doesn't think of you <br />
as a freak.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm okay sweetie, everything's just fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
After a good night's sleep Maggie had to concede to one thing with her cub's argument. <br />
What was so grand about being human? She hadn't felt so clear headed in years. She <br />
couldn't remember the last time her mind had felt so focused, when her goals and purpose <br />
in life had been so perfectly defined. Everything made sense, she knew what she had to do <br />
with herself. She would rescue her cub from that fake doe. Nothing else mattered, she <br />
didn't matter, only her cub mattered.<br />
<br />
If anyone had been able to look inside Maggie's mind right now, they would have been <br />
amazed at how perfectly her bear instincts and human personality traits had so perfectly <br />
meshed. A lot like Naomi growing accustomed to the sense of purpose and order her <br />
existence as an evolved husky provided; Maggie had quickly grown to like, and outright <br />
embrace her own newfound sense of purpose. Maggie realized that to this feeling, being <br />
human, was totally secondary.<br />
<br />
Maybe she'd even keep this form after she had dragged her cub out of this fantasy. True, <br />
there were the countless practical aspects to consider, like weather she'd have to waste <br />
three months of her life each year in a semi-sleep state (to note, bears do not technically <br />
hibernate),  and weather she could possibly live a normal life with these humans and body <br />
shape. But those were all things to consider, after her precious and only cub was away <br />
from that very very inappropriate mate. She just needed to find a buck who wasn't already <br />
in the pecking order.<br />
<br />
There was a chance that a new buck might not show before her cub made the biggest <br />
mistake of his life, but Maggie wasn't about to give up hope. She decided she'd check out <br />
the entrance doors first, best bet. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Marth said, &quot;I can guess finding someone must be hard for you given your, ahem, <br />
history, but don't start feeding me a story just so I'll break up with someone I'm already <br />
connected to. It makes you look selfish.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not being selfish! And if you don't believe me, then you'll find out the truth for <br />
yourself soon enough, and it won't be pleasant when you do find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would Larry like guys anyway?! He's as straight as a rod.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah REALLY wasn't sure how she was going to drop the next bomb shell, and if it <br />
might better -if- she just let it come to Marth when it would, but given Marth's situation, it <br />
just might be better he found out sooner than later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Hannah said, &quot;I used to let people figure this out for themselves, since I was still <br />
trying to figure it out for myself. But I think I better warn you. If you were interested in the <br />
opposite sex before hand, then you stay interested in the opposite if your gender changes, <br />
but it's the opposite of your NEW sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marth actually took a step back at that, the idea reeling in his head. The idea completely <br />
freaking him out. However, it made a frightful amount of sense considering how his eyes <br />
kept drifting back to the great orbs below Hannah's neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me if I don't trust the word of a perfect stranger over what I know about my other <br />
half.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah managed to realize, who could blame him? What would you say if someone told <br />
you your other half had left you behind your back and was now carrying someone else's <br />
child. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you march in and try to make out with Leticia on the spot. You're going to be attacked <br />
by every buck in the herd, you're only to hurt both Leticia and yourself. Leticia is a dear <br />
friend of mine, I don't want to see -her- hurt like that. And she never said anything <br />
negative about you, -you- don't deserve to be hurt like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take my chances.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy is the head buck, Leticia CHOSE him, that makes her important in the other bucks' <br />
eyes. You'll be trespassing on sacred ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I'll take my chances. You don't know Larry the way I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right. But you don't know Leticia the way I do.&quot; Hannah shook her head, deciding <br />
to tackle the problem head on, discarding the dangers to yourself, typical male behavior. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if your tall tale is true, I'll bring Larry back to me, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make promises you may not be able to keep, it'll feel like a dead weight dragging <br />
behind you the rest of your life.&quot; Hannah knew if she had said 'won't be able' this <br />
discussion would have ended on the spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if your story is true, you'd be crazy to think I'd give up without a fight.&quot; <br />
<br />
'At least he's determined,' Hannah thought.  <br />
++++++<br />
<br />
There were in fact a catholic minister in the park at the time, on prolonged leave, who had <br />
chosen the form of a raccoon (deciding a dove or a donkey or a mountain lion would have <br />
been a sign of hubris on his own part). And was currently fishing. Though not in his <br />
normal spot.  Though he actually held regular service for those who would bother to <br />
attend. <br />
<br />
The older of the news hound lynx told the head stag's mate, &quot;Okay, about the Father <br />
Raccoon, be sure to tell him you adopted your mother's religion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Said Leticia, &quot;My mother was wiccan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, this guy doesn't mind marrying Buddhists, Jews, Hindus, or pretty much any <br />
religion... but apparently he has this sore spot about Protestants. Something about them <br />
not considering the Virgin Mary sacred.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two deer looked at each other and nodded, &quot;Okay, we'll remember that.&quot;</p>
