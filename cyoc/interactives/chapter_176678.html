<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the energy from the beam suffused through her, Amy couldn&#39;t help but feel absolutely euphoric. Today had started out terrible, waking up with a kink in her back, then accidentally dropping the eggs in the kitchen, the hole in the yard that someone&#39;s dog had dug up and she had fallen into, and more. But right now, this very moment, she didn&#39;t care. Her body thrummed with an electricity that bordered on eternity, and she was going to ride it as long as she could. In a word, it was like a full body orgasm and a sugar rush all rolled into one.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh my,&quot; Amy moaned out. &quot;This is... It&#39;s-&quot;<br />
<br />
But before she could even finish, the beam quickly cut off, leaving her felt as if she was gently but suddenly brought back to Earth. And the disappointment was noticeable on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-why did you stop? It was just getting GOOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jeff began, turning around in his chair. &quot;I noticed you were feeling good. And I figured...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes went wide as she saw him reach unzip his pants, and pulling out his dick, began to waggle it in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I feel good, too?<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s mind began to race. She wanted to scream, to chew out her only son, to call him a pervert, a monster, a sick degenerate. But instead, her mind could only focus on one thing: COCK. That beautiful cock that was being waved before her. That delicious seed that was in those glorious balls of his. The overwhelming desire to lick it, nuzzle it, suckle it, savor it, run it over her face, smell it, embrace it, put it in her, be covered by his juices, to swallow every drop he gave to her, to be his receptacle. To worship his manhood like the god it was.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Amy dropped onto her knees and hands and crawled her way over, keeping her eyes on the prize. Drawing ever closer to the thing that tantalized her most, until it was right before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-It&#39;s only fair to make you feel good, too...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she gently took hold of Jeff&#39;s wonderful dick, and the second she put it in her mouth, the wonderful feeling returned. Her mind began to swim in sensations completely unknown to her, but all welcome and delicious. The fullness as he grew erect, slipping deeper within her throat, as if it was making her full somehow. She was like a fiend, desperate for something only Jeff could give her. Time had no meaning to her. Just his cock. Suddenly, she felt someone grabbing her hair, pulling her backwards until, with a loud, wet pop, the magnificent dick was pulled out of her mewling, needy mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the bed,&quot; Jeff commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you-&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of ripping cloth caught her attention, letting her know that something was different. Looking down, she noticed that her sleeves had been blown out by the powerful arms that belonged more on a professional bodybuilder that had replaced her own, ending in a pair of strong, masculine hands, capped with thick fingers that she wiggled to her absolute amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God,&quot; she said, suddenly noting that her voice was now a husky rumble. &quot;How is this even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said get on the bed, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her head snapped at what her so-<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Amy found herself musing. &quot;Is Jeff my son? It&#39;s just so hard to think...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drinking him in, she looked up at Jeff once more. Same 6&#39;5 frame, same powerful build, same magnificent large cock, same gloriously large balls. She just wanted him to take her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna do it this way, then? Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a whirlwind, he reached down and in one quick maneuver, ripped off both her blouse and pants, leaving her bare to the world before picking her up with a laugh and playfully throwing her onto the bed. Driving her into a mild panic as she looked around, thinking she would bounce off her man&#39;s twin sized-<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, twin? We&#39;ve always had a King sized bed. Why was I concerned about falling off a twin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling the bed shifting behind her, her skin felt electric as Jeff ran his rough, callused hands across her skin while he proceeded to kiss her shoulders and neck. A moan escaped from her, deeper than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look in the mirror,&quot; Jeff ordered Amdy. Without hesitation, she did as she was ordered. All of 26 years of age, a body built by hours in the gym and the best pharmaceuticals money could buy, her short cropped hair, her model like looks. It was worth all the hours of suffering and agony to get to this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Amdy begged. &quot;Please, sir. Play with my pathetic clit cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jeff growled in Amdy&#39;s ear, his hand sliding down her abs and to her groin. &quot;You mean this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her world once more exploded into a vast void of pleasure and sensation. She had to fight to stay aware, wanting to revel in the feelings of her man&#39;s touch, stroking them with such love and care. Amdy reached behind, grabbing Jeff&#39;s head and drawing him in for a kiss. All they wanted was to be like this forever. To ride this beautiful high, to let the pressure build until it came with a perfect crescendo.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Breaking the kiss, Andy stared directly into the mirror, directly at Jeff. He knew he was ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff plunged his full length into Andy&#39;s ass, causing his world to explode once more. The slow, romantic ministrations were gone, given way to the primal fucking of passion as Jeff proceeded to plunge into his lover with abandon. With each thrust, the pressure within Andy grew and grew, coupled by the frenzied motions of Jeff&#39;s hand as he continuously jacked off his boyfriend. Jeff noticed the weight on the bed shifting as he took in his former mother&#39;s body, growing larger and heavier with more muscle, steadily becoming taller and more masculine. Blowing past the 200&#39;s and into the 300&#39;s. His skin looking thinner and thinner, almost painted on over the incredible definition of his bloating body. Taking delight in the sounds of his bones cracking and groaning to compensate for both the weight and the features of the lover he always wanted.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Andy cried out in a mix of pleasure and pure pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;, Jeff asked, worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-something c-coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could only smile at that moment. The moment he had been waiting for. Looking down at Andy&#39;s dick, he noticed it had finally formed into a proud and hefty cock. Lifting it up, he continued stroking with abandon as he saw the hole that had once given birth to him slowly seal shut. Soon, his mother would be gone, replaced by the man he wanted in his life. Acting quickly, he grabbed one of Andy&#39;s hands and forced it onto his own cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do all the work, slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
Addled with the sensations of change, Andy quickly grabbed onto his dick and proceeded to jack off for all he was worth. He couldn&#39;t let Jeff down, after all. His hand was a blur, pumping as fast as he could while Jeff picked up speed as he fucked his former mother, now soon to be boyfriend. Grabbing Andy&#39;s full ass, he made sure to make his first time one to never forget, making him scream and shout loud enough for the neighbors to hear. It was if they were one synchronous being, tied by love and sex. Building to one beautiful union.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-IT&#39;S COMING SIR,&quot; Andy screamed out. &quot;I- I&#39;M COMING!&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment Jeff had been waiting for was here. Putting Andy upright, he growled with an intensity he did not know he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it come, babe! LET IT COME!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Andy began to scream in pure joy and relief as his balls slid into his sack, full and large as he came, splattering the mirror with volley after volley of cum until, one full minute later, he could give no more. It was when he knew that Andy was spent that Jeff proceeded to flip his lover over, and shoving his cock in with an intense need, throat fucked his lover until he unloaded down his gullet. The whole time, Andy moaned and hummed, as if his lover&#39;s seed was his ambrosia, his lifeblood. Falling back on the bed, his cock unsheathing from his slut&#39;s mouth, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but be exhausted. A Hell of a way to lose your virginity, he reckoned. He looked over at the muscle stud that his mother had become, the prodigious muscles, the still semi-turgid fuckstick, the gorgeous face. He knew that he&#39;d be ready to go in a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minute break, get some water, then I&#39;m gonna cum in the nice bubble butt of yours. We&#39;re gonna try for five loads today. One will be with suction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy reached out to the mirror, slid his palm across the pane and licked his hand, imagining the cum he was tasting was more of Jeff&#39;s. He smiled weakly at his boyfriend, knowing that Jeff was training him to take his real limit. But he wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>
