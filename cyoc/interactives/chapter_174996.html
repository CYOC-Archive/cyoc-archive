<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt was trying to adjust to his new life as a were-condom, luckily Ben was a good friend to help him along the way. Every two days Ben was with Matt when he transformed and used him right away to allow him to turn back. But the fear of turning into one at the wrong time when Ben wasn’t around still scared him. Even if he did turn into a condom in a place where people are sexualty active, the chance someone would use an unwrapped condom from the floor was slim, if he wasn’t used and tossed, would that mean he winds up an unused condom forever? Kicked around the floor? Or swept away?<br />
<br />
Matt wanted to talk to Ben more about any way to change the Chronivac settings during their next class together, which as fate’s funny way would have it, was Sex Ed class. It was a casual class with no grades so Matt thought that was a good time to chat with Ben.<br />
<br />
As Ben got seated in the back table of the classroom Matt ran in to quickly grab the seat next to him, they were in the back corner and should be more secluded to get away with talking during the lecture. <br />
<br />
“Whao, what’s the rush Matt,” Ben asked in surprise, “you normally don’t sit with me in this class, I was saving this set for Jennifer.” <br />
<br />
“Listen, we need to talk,” I vented as quietly as I could, “I am not sure if the options you set on Chronivac were ideal. Is there any way after school today you come over to my place and we try some other options? I am not sure for the rest of my life that you would need to be with me every two days, what happens if you were out of town or moved away for college.”<br />
<br />
“Whao, okay, let’s take it easy,” Ben said trying to calm me down since my voice was getting louder as more students piled in. “Look we can deal with this after class.”<br />
<br />
“I just don’t want to spend the next half of my life turning into a-”<br />
<br />
“Condom!”<br />
<br />
In an instant Matt and Ben froze and turned to a new voice. It was Miss June the Sex Ed teacher standing in front of their table staring at them.<br />
<br />
“I hope you two love birds are talking about condoms,” Miss June said as she slammed a wrapped condom and a banana on their table, “because that is the topic we are covering today.”<br />
<br />
She continued to the next table distributing the condoms and bananas. <br />
<br />
“Great,” Matt muttered, “I guess time to learn more about my body… both of them I guess.”<br />
Ben chuckled at Matt&#39;s attempt at a joke or just his exhaustion, but he got a laugh either way. Miss June went back to the front and started her lecture.<br />
<br />
“If anyone tries to talk you out of using a condom, saying it will tear or break, know that’s just a myth. These things are very durable.”<br />
<br />
Miss June took an unwrapped condom in her hand and gave a fierce tug in an attempt to rip it. This caused Matt to winch a bit unexpectedly. She then went to the sink faucet and wrapped the condom around the nozzle and turned the water on.<br />
<br />
“As you can see these things can withstand a lot of force and hold a lot.”<br />
<br />
The condom filled to the size of a pillow and still didn’t pop. Miss June turned off the sink as the condom was about to burst.<br />
<br />
“See didn’t even pop. Now I doubt all the guys here collectively can fill a single condom with that amount,” she said pointing to the large water filled condom. “So now we are going to pratice safe sex but practicing putting a condom on these bananas.” <br />
<br />
“Alright Matt, time to put your twin on this banana,” Ben joked, but he noticed Matt was not laughing and looked nervous. “Matt what is wrong? I mean it’s not like these condoms are like you.”<br />
<br />
“No… I feel weird,” Matt started to panic. “The same feeling I got before… before I turn into a condom.”<br />
<br />
Ben looked at Matt as if he were joking then noticed the serious look on his face, “shit, really here of all places, you aren’t due to transform until tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, I don’t know, but I feel like I am going to,” Matt started panicking more. <br />
<br />
Ben started looking at Matt as he started shrinking and his body took on a transparent white texture, luckily the other students were busy with putting the condom on their bananas.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ben whisphered, “just transform in your seat and I will collect your clothing then ask to go to the restroom then use you there.”<br />
<br />
It was already too late Matt couldn’t talk anymore and was shrinking into his shirt fast. Ben started as the shirt collapsed on the seat as Matt’s jeans fell to the floor. He had lost sight of Matt. Ben quickly scrambled to dig through the shirt to find Matt. <br />
<br />
Finally Ben grabbed on to something rubber then with his fingers held Matt up and shouted with triumph “Got you!”<br />
<br />
That made the class turn to stare at him as well as got Miss June’s attention who stormed over to Ben.<br />
<br />
“Where did your partner go? And why is his clothing still here,” Miss June asked in confusion and in an annoyed tone.  <br />
<br />
“Ummm… he went to the bathroom to… change into his PE clothing?” Ben tried to make up an excuse.<br />
<br />
“Well if he had to go and you don’t have something to practice with, and since you really want to show off your condom to everyone why don’t you go to the front of the class and show us all how it’s done.”<br />
<br />
“Umm,” Ben started to panic.<br />
<br />
“NOW!” shouted Miss June. <br />
<br />
Ben tried to find the other condom but realized it was lost in the comotion and that Matt was now the only condom he had. <br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Ben whispered to Matt as he grabbed the banana and took them both to the front of the classroom. <br />
<br />
“Now Mr. Show Off why don’t you demonstrate the proper way to put a condom on,” Miss June said with her arms crossed.<br />
<br />
Ben looked at Matt and gave an apologetic face, he knew no one else would know the condom was Matt so the embarrassment would only be between them and that he had used Matt a handful of times by now but the banana was much thicker than what Matt would have been used too he was worried about breaking him. But remembered the condom filled in the sink and hoped Matt could also handle being stretched.<br />
<br />
Ben slowly and carefully placed Matt on the bottom end of the banana and slowly unrolled him, being ever so gentle as to not cause too much of a forceful tug.<br />
<br />
“Faster,” Miss June shouted, “lunch break  is soon.”<br />
<br />
Ben slipped Matt on faster, the smell of the banana was sweet yet combined with the smell of latex from Matt was an odd combination. Finally he got Matt completely on.<br />
<br />
Miss June instantly went over and snatched Matt away from Ben’s hands, she held up the banana to the class.<br />
<br />
“Now here you can see an average attempt at putting on a condom,” she tugged at the condom a bit, “but you can see Ben here left a bit of the tip slacked.” She continued to “man-handle” Matt who was getting dizzy being on the banana which was then moved and jerked around. <br />
<br />
Ben stared at Matt hoping to snatch him back, Miss June noticed and dismissed him back to his seat. <br />
<br />
“But, can I get my banana back,” Ben asked.<br />
<br />
“No, I will be using yours for the rest of the lesson, get back to your seat.”<br />
<br />
Ben made his way back to his table trying to figure out how he would get Matt back after class. Ben doubted Miss June would keep all the bananas wrapped in condoms but would she toss them? Would Matt turn back when tossed in the trash? Was he technically used? If he did try to dig for Matt out of the trash how would he explain it off if others saw him? Would they think it was a prev for trying to rescue condom wrapped bananas in the trash?<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s continue,” Miss June said, holding the Matt wrapped banana up to the class.</p>
