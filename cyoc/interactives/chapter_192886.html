<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what are we doing again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie paused, turning towards Samantha&#39;s husband Mike, the athletic man gazing up at the eerie looking house in front of him. &quot;Investigating,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I told Gloria and the Morelands I would check this place out for them. There&#39;s probably a nest in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A vampire nest,&quot; Mike said flatly, to which Katie nodded. Mike sighed, his shoulders slumping as the two made their way towards the door. &quot;Knew I should have just agreed to give Tricia a bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now stifled a laugh, she could empathize with the young father. She and her wife Kellie far too often felt they were wrestling a wild animal whenever they tried putting Morgan to bed. &quot;You think we were this hard when we were the kids age?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah my folks said I loved taking a bath,&quot; Mike smiled. &quot;Keeping clothes on though was a whole other story.&quot; Katie laughed, wiping a stray tear from her eye as the two now entered the the abandoned home. &quot;So how is family life Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I may complain but I love it,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Tricia is just so smart. And, since the season ended I&#39;ve been spending as much free time with Sammy and Tricia as I can. It was hard this year, being on the road, getting home late, I hated not being around for dinner or bedtime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Know Sammy felt the same way,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;Especially when Tricia started showing off her magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard,&quot; Mike grumbled. &quot;Sammy almost had a heart attack when Tricia grew dragon wings and started flying around the house. Thank goodness Sammhbwas able to teach her how to shape shift, we thought we were going to have to cut holes in all her shirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan set her toddler bed on fire,&quot; Katie said sheepishly. &quot;I&#39;m just glad I was home. Kellie would of had a conniption fit if she saw that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet our parents didn&#39;t have to deal with this when we were young,&quot; Mike chuckled. As the young parents now scanned the interior of the house, they strained their ears trying to discern movement. The sound of footsteps above them immediately drew their attention. &quot;How many you think,&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four or five,&quot; Katie said softly. &quot;But I would bet there are more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You faced an vampires yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Katie said softly. &quot;The night Mrs. Tozawa got turned into a 13 year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the Morelands,&quot; he asked. &quot;You trust them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t given me a reason not too,&quot; Katie shrugged. &quot;Actually went over to their house. Really nice family. Gloria is actually dating their eldest. Real good kid named Caleb.&quot; Mike nodded, sighing as he realized he and Samantha hadn&#39;t been out on a date in months now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this our social life now,&quot; Mike smirked. &quot;Noticed none us really go out anymore. Only time we seem to see eachother is when we get the kids together for play dates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can you, say adulting sucks,&quot; Katie smirked. <br />
<br />
Mike simply shrugged, before smiling. Adulting definitely did suck sometimes. &quot;So guessing we split up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh not a great idea,&quot; Katie replied. &quot;Besides, don&#39;t want to lose my best client. I didnt pull all those all nights in college to get a degree in Sports Medicine just to lose you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike nodded as the two now entered a side room. Scanning the room the duo could see a thin layer of dust covering the moth eaten furniture. As they slowly crept forward they now tried to spot any sign of movement in the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Idiot humans,&quot; a vampire named Wes thought. &quot;Checking the shadows when they should just simply look up.&quot; Wes had only been turned recently. After delivering a pizza, the 19 year old was surprised when two very attractive women had answered the door. Wes knew the family well enough. The kid that lived their was named Wyatt, a quiet unassuming teen who lived with his overweight mother and elderly grandma. Wes had delivered enough pizzas to the address that he would say they were regulars.<br />
<br />
 On the night he was turned, he had thought nothing of it. It was supposed to be his last drop off of the night. While he was surprised that they had called so late, he didn&#39;t think anything was off. That is until two shapely women answered the door. Shapely women ordering pizza wasn&#39;t the surprise, them flirting with him and inviting him inside was. Wes had believed he was about to live every delivery guys dream, instead he found himself set upon by three vampires. When he awoke he felt stronger, more powerful, and knew what he needed to do. Bring more victims into the fold.<br />
<br />
Now hanging stealthily from the ceiling, Wes sized up his prey. Both people looked to be in their early to mid twenties and athletic. Wes quickly put together a plan of attack. He would pounce on the man, who appeared to be quite muscular before the rest of the nest fed on the woman. When be was done he would have two very powerful vampires to present to Wyatt and Lord Miro.<br />
<br />
Wes hissed, releasing his hold as he pounced on the man&#39;s back. The man was quite a bit stronger than Wes had anticipated, staying on his feet as he desperately tried to shake the vampire of his back. It was a fruitless effort though. As Wes now opened his mouth, his fangs glistening in the moonlight, he looked to bite down on the man&#39;s jugular.<br />
<br />
Or so he thought.<br />
<br />
Wes felt a crunch inside his mouth, the taste of copper flooding his taste buds. For a moment the vampire was confused. He felt an intense pain in his mouth, yet he tasted blood. Suddenly a powerful hand grabbed hold of him, pulling him off the man&#39;s back and tossing him to the floor. <br />
<br />
Wes crashed in a heap, his mouth throbbing as he now spit out his own blood and two small white pieces. Slowly it dawned on the vampire what the white things were. He had somehow shattered his own fangs on the man&#39;s neck. Turning towards the man, his mouth pouring blood, Wes gaped at the man.<br />
<br />
It appeared that the trap was successful. Mike had quickly shifted his body into organic steel. Mike now stood glaring at the vampire, his metallic eyes seeming to burn a hole into the vampire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you were right,&quot; Mike smirked. &quot;If we made enough noise they would jump us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you,&quot; Wes choked, his speech garbled by a mouth full of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard,&quot; Mike smirked. Wes now watched as the metallic wizard now began to form a small metallic ball in his hand that began lazily orbiting him. With but a flick of his wrist, Mike sent the ball sailing at Wes, the vampire unable to act as the silver ball tore through his heart, setting the vampire a blaze and killing him instantly.<br />
<br />
Katie now unsheathed Excalibur, her body instantly becoming that of a Seraph, covered in holy armor. Their attack had drawn the attention of the dozen or so vampires squatting in the home. The battle itself only took moments, the two wizards making short work of their adversaries.<br />
<br />
As Mike now punched a hole in the chest of a vampire, killing it instantly, he could see the sole survivor leap through a window as it sped off. &quot;Katie ones getting away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it go,&quot; Katie said calmly, as she beheaded a female vampire. &quot;Let him run back to his masters so he can tell them that if they want to survive they should leave us alone.&quot;</p>
