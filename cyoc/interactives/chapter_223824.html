<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan looked at the guy, who was clearly getting into the spirit of things… perhaps a bit too much. It was kind of off-putting how he suddenly flipped the script there, but at the same time… there was something kind of arousing to it too. Ryan couldn’t help standing there, wondering what it would do for others when it turned a mildly mannered person into something a bit dominant… just from being in its presence. Hell… Ryan wondered what it was doing to him… as his mind was racing… he couldn’t even remember if there was a time when he felt different than how he was feeling now. As Ryan stood there, his mind wandered, thinking about who the best candidate would be to wear it… who would make the greatest difference, and then his mind turned to the upcoming party that they were having… the Halloween Weekend Bender. Ryan grinned at the thought of the entire dorm being raunchy, filthy, frat bros doing all sorts of debaucherous and kinky things amongst each other… and then his mind pictured the head of their fraternal order, Logan, leading it and driving all of the guys into lecherous, kinky and filthy things with one another. An erection was slowly building in his pants, his mind focused on kneeling… but kneeling for Logan as he was dominated in every way by Logan. Thoughts of bukkake and golden showers were just some of the things Ryan had run through his mind and he knew that Logan was definitely the best candidate for the harness… hell… not a single other guy was even remotely worthy of wearing it!<br />
<br />
“You know man… if I didn’t have a guy I wanted to kneel to, I would definitely take you up on your command. You remember I am part of TFU… and since you are clearly in the know about our fraternity, surely you must know the leader Logan?” Ryan asked as he grabbed a hold of the harness and started to walk to the front of the store with it.<br />
<br />
“You mean that beefy lumberjack of a man, Logan? The strongman that can bench a tractor tire and has a bulge that makes everyone who sees it weak in their knees? Yeah… I know Logan… he and I used to be a thing!” He said, giving a big wink to Ryan. “Yeah… he’s going to be a great one to give that to!” He said in addition, but then asked, “So… what are you going to do about your costume?”<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck! That’s right… um…” Ryan said, looking around, trying to figure something out really quickly, but then moved to the roleplay section and found stuff for ‘Pup Play’ and grabbed a large pup hood that had yellow accents and a solid yellow collar to match. “I think these are good?” Ryan said, very unsure of himself.<br />
<br />
“Good… no… you’re definitely golden bud!” He said grinning, “Shame you didn’t want to kneel for me, you dirty pup!”<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned, feeling more assured of himself, then leaned in close to the worker. “Yeah? Well… I could potentially still kneel for you… though it would need to be at the party…” It was then that Ryan noticed the small tattoo on the center cleft of his collar. “Oh shit! You’re part of TFU?!”<br />
<br />
The clerk grinned and nodded, “Yeah… thought you figured that out earlier. Granted I am not in college anymore and didn’t get my degree because life had other ideas and plans for me, I still pay dues and I am still a part of the fraternity.” Grant admitted. “Since my shift is over now, why don’t we go to the party together and I can say hello to Logan with you?”<br />
<br />
As the harness was weaving its debaucherous magic, it was slowly working its way through both of the male’s minds, trying to rope as many as it could into its clutches and provide a hellaciously good time. Having the pup play items in Ryan’s possession, playing on his submissive nature, the harness slowly altered his vocabulary to include appropriate responses.<br />
<br />
“Woof! Fuck yeah bro, let’s go!” He barked and then howled.<br />
<br />
With a grin, the clerk smiled and patted Ryan on his head like the good boy that he was. “Good boy! Very good boy! By the way, what’s your name boy? My name’s Grant and I need just a second to punch out on my phone.”<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled, his cock filled his pants as the words of praise completely aroused him and if he had a tail, it would have been wagging behind him furiously. “Oh! I never did introduce myself, did I? My name is Ryan, Sir.”<br />
<br />
Fumbling around on his phone, not intentionally ignoring Ryan, Grant opened the application his employer used to track the employee’s hours, which he also used to give everyone their weekly schedules. With a few quick taps, he was punched out and the two were on their way out the door after Ryan paid for the harness. If he had been thinking right, the price tag of two hundred and fifty dollars would have definitely made him think twice about being on his own for his college funding, but the harness had other plans and the cost wasn’t even a thought on his mind. With the harness in his possession, swinging near his legs, Ryan and Grant walked side by side out to the parking lot, splitting up to go to their respective vehicles.<br />
<br />
“Alright brother Ryan, I will see you at the party. I am just going to come dressed how I am now. Since this is going to be a raunchy party, I see no need to change!” He said with a grin, then waved as he swung his body into the car and drove off, Ryan doing the same after putting the bagged harness and pup play gear into the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
The drive didn’t take long and for the most part, Ryan found himself right behind Grant the majority of the time. It felt like he was right where he was meant to be, tailing and being under his superior. The harness, simply in his presence, was driving his submissive nature deeper, longer, further, and harder to the point where Ryan would serve and obey those above him in the hierarchy. The hellacious harness, which was mildly sentient, was glad to finally be out of that place and being put to use. It would have a pack to serve it very, very soon. As the minutes rolled on, Grant pulled up to the public street closest to the fraternity as Ryan pulled into the driveway and went to where the mass parking was provided for all of those who owned vehicles. Once parked, he felt a need to jog up to Grant and walk into the frathouse with him. Ryan didn’t know why he felt this way, but he knew that it felt “right”.<br />
<br />
As Ryan grabbed the bag and headed to the street, somewhat double-timing it to get to Grant, he noticed a figure out of his peripheral vision through the angled window of the bay window that adorned the front of the house. Ryan slowed down for a moment, but didn’t completely stop, realizing that it was Logan who was alone in the Master Study sitting in the large chair at the rather large desk pining away at his studies. The Master Study was a perfect place to enjoy one’s self when studying was necessary. Tons of books adorned the built-in bookshelves; the huge and plush leather chair that enveloped whoever sat in it sat behind the rather large desk in front of the old and unused brick fireplace. Ryan grinned as Logan was so intently focused on “Man… Logan is always on top of his studies, even with a huge bender about to happen!” Ryan thought to himself as he met up with Grant as he stepped out of the car and onto the cement pathway leading to the enormous wooden double doors.<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled and waved at Grant as he slightly jogged up to the guy. “Glad to see you here, Sir!”<br />
<br />
Grant grinned and chuckled, “Yeah… it’s really nice to be back at my old stomping grounds. Glad you could meet me too, being the good puppy boy you are!” He said in a praising, playful, raising tone.<br />
<br />
Ryan nearly lost it at the words of praise as the plastic bag plopped to the ground, his jaw hung open with a smile curled up at the clefts of his mouth, panting to show how happy he was as a good boy and even dropped to his knees in front of Grant.<br />
<br />
Patting Ryan on the head, his hand rested atop his head, fingers sifting through the hair, grinning the whole time as he was petting the good boy and affirming those submissive pup thoughts in his mind. “Yeah… you are a really good boy, aren’t you? Kneeling in front of your Master like this… just wish you did it back at the store. Knowing Logan as I do… he won’t mind me owning you pup! You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Just bark for me if the answer is yes.” Grant said and directed the obedient Ryan, his eyes taking on an ominous crimson hue, teeth slowly elongating into fangs… though still human… they were far more pronounced and sharper than what normal people had.<br />
<br />
Kneeling there before Grant, he simply replied as directed… though quite emphatically, “Woof!”<br />
<br />
“Good boy! Now, let’s get you into the dorm and give Master Logan what is his, and as a payment, I am sure Master Logan will give you to me.” Grant instructed as Ryan obeyed, getting up on his two feet, grabbing the bag once more, and walking beside him up and into the house.<br />
<br />
Ryan didn’t waste time announcing their presence, seeing if the other brothers were home, knowing that they wouldn’t be because of their duties to the frat as well as to their education… which was why they were there in the first place. Also… knowing that Logan was in the study definitely helped save both fraternity brothers time. As Ryan opened the door to the study, he and Grant were assaulted by frigid air from the heavily cooled room. Ryan knew how much Logan loved things to be cold, but damn it if it wasn’t incredibly cold! Though, with the harness in the bag in their presence, Ryan knew things were going to heat up and Logan was going to become a fan of the heat.<br />
<br />
“Hey Logan!” Ryan said as he stepped foot into the room. Grant tailed right behind him, giving Ryan no chance to turn back if he even wanted to.<br />
<br />
Not hearing the door open and being quickly pulled out of his concentration on his studies by the unexpected voice, Logan nearly jumped out of his seat, his meaty hand over his plump pectorals allowing both new inhabitants of the room to see the pert and perky nipples under the shirt that clung so tightly to his burly body.<br />
<br />
“Fuck all Ryan! What have I said about scaring the shit out of me?” Logan said, coming down from the shock and seeing Ryan standing in the room, not noticing Grant there.<br />
<br />
“Sorry man… you were deep into it, like usual, and there was no way to not scare or startle you. Sure… I could have knocked, but would that have made things any different?” Ryan questioned, knowing the answer already, which was no… it wouldn’t.<br />
<br />
Logan grumbled and growled under his breath, but calmed down shortly thereafter. “So… you ready for the costume party bro?” He asked, noticing the bag in his hand from the sex shop. “Looks like an odd place to get your costume and you’re presenting it to me for approval?”<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned, “Yeah… something like that big guy! I have my costume, which I am sure you will approve of, but more importantly… I got something for you!” Ryan said as he walked toward Logan, feeling the harness having an odd warmth to it, which felt incredible against his once icy cold hand from the low temperature in the room.<br />
<br />
“Something for me? From a sex shop? Are you fucking kidding me right now Ryan?!” Logan asked as his voice started raising, getting more aggressive by the moment. “You know what my girlfriend would do to me if she knew I was given something by someone from a fucking sex shop?!” Logan said growling a bit.<br />
<br />
Grant then stepped a bit further into the room with a wry grin on his face. “Dude… how about you calm the fuck down and since when does a monstrous wolf like you get tamed by a bitch?”<br />
<br />
Hearing the familiar voice that he hadn’t heard in quite some time, his eyes widened and his ears perked up, “I… I know that voice!” Logan said, not really able to see Grant at the moment being that he was obscured by Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Heh-heh, yeah… it’s me… the old Frat Master! How’ve you been horn dog?” Grant said, stepping out from behind Ryan for Logan to see him completely.<br />
<br />
“Wait… Frat Master?! You mean you led this Fraternity when you went to school here?! And… Logan was appointed by you to run this place?” Ryan asked astonished by the newest revelation.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, he was and he was probably the best at it too! Made filling his shoes quite tough and he was the biggest hardass we had running the show, kept the boys in line, and made for wild fucking parties! Looks like the whole ‘Master’ bit hasn’t left ya after I got you into the leather scene, huh?” Logan quipped as he walked up to Grant, giving him a huge, burly hug. “Looks like you’ve put on a little muscle too!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… once I started taking dominion over guys who begged to worship me here, during all of our parties, I couldn’t ever see myself submitting to someone else’s rule or authority. Sure… I do it in the workplace, but that’s because I have to, but I don’t like it. Honestly… I am trying to take over at the Sex Shop because the boss is looking to retire and I want to run the show… probably making changes and getting the place to carry a lot more kinky gear. However, that doesn’t answer my question Brother Logan, and as former Master… I invoke the ‘Right to Know’.” Grant said with building authority as the harness was affecting everyone in the room now, pushing much more authority into Logan, but also a slight submissive nature to know his place among those greater than him, that person being Grant. Before then, Ryan knew nothing about any of the stuff the two were talking about, but he chalked it up to just not knowing… when in reality… the harness was slowly warping reality around it to fit its desires.<br />
<br />
Logan’s eyes widened and his demeanor changed a bit, humbling himself before Grant. “Ehrm… yes… sorry Sir. You didn’t need to invoke that, I would have told you anyway. A monster wolf like me got tied down to Megan DeLane when, one morning after a bender a month or two ago she came to me saying she was pregnant and I was the father. Fuckin’ sucks too… killed my party days… especially since you know I am gay and love fuckin’ dominating dudes! Hell… being your partner before you left was the best! Guess the liquid courage gave me courage down there and it was any port in the storm after you left.” Logan admitted a bit sheepishly, ashamed of himself and the predicament he was in.<br />
<br />
“Wait… Megan DeLane… the girl that crashed every one of our parties, trying to get knocked up by any of the brothers here… that Megan DeLane?” Grant asked, his voice getting far more stern, angry, and aggressive.<br />
<br />
Logan started to brace himself for a lashing, knowing that she was deemed “off-limits” due to doing exactly what Grant was referring to. According to the stories Ryan had heard from the other brothers, she was a problem. She was banned during Grant’s days because she purposefully would have sex with the brothers unprotected and wanted to tie one of them down to her with a kid. The final straw was when she came to one of their parties, she was told to leave because she wasn’t welcome and then produced a box of condoms with an assortment of sizes. When she provided them, one of the doorkeepers checked the condoms over and noticed that they had been tampered with, but played cool. He asked for Grant to come, feigning that it was for approval since he didn’t want to make that call, but it was actually to get him to have her arrested and an order of protection to be made on the fraternity and all members. With the message whispered to one of the fellow brothers, they nodded and went to go tell Grant. Hearing what was going on, Grant became furious, called the police, and informed them of her attempt to get knocked up by one of them and even went as far as saying there was a rumor about her being positive for HIV… since tampering with a condom wasn’t enough to get the police to do anything. However, once the police were informed, Grant played coy and went out there to talk with Megan, keeping her occupied until the police arrived. With her back turned, she was oblivious to what was going on as they pulled up. Grant, having seen them and they motioned toward her, silently inquiring if she was the one, he gently nodded in reply. They arrested her, he gave the tampered condoms to them and they took her away.<br />
<br />
“Yes Grant, that Megan DeLane and please, before you start to chastise me, let me explain.” Logan started, hoping that the verbal tongue-lashing wouldn’t be as severe once his story was told.<br />
<br />
“No… it’s your reign, your rules… so I don’t need to hear anything. However, I will let you in on a secret so the Monster Wolf you are can go back to being just that, owning pups… all of the brothers in the fraternal house. Megan DeLane isn’t pregnant… she has made it all up. Before Ryan came to the store, she came in talking with a few of her friends, looking to buy some dildos for some self-pleasure later. In doing so, she made comments about how some guy would be pissed to know she was buying something so large to go deep inside her when she is supposed to be pregnant with his kid… all to lasso him… which I know now is you… into giving her everything that she wanted for an unknown duration before it started to become noticeable that she wasn’t exactly pregnant.” Grant said, effectively cutting the leash off of his neck and freeing him to be himself again.<br />
<br />
“That fuckin’ whore!” Logan roared, the harness changing all of them, as his eyes flashed crimson for a moment. “That fuckin’ slut thinks she can play me! I know I should be happy and relieved that I am not having her kid, which I am, but fuck am I pissed that she was going to string me along for as long as she could to be her fuckin’ wallet!” He roared in anger as his body started getting bigger, and thicker, filling those clothes a bit more and starting to stretch them out as both Grant and Ryan noticed his already decent body hair coverage and beard started to get a little thicker, fuller, and his beard grew slightly more bushy.<br />
<br />
Grant grinned, motioning for Ryan to present the harness to him and let him don it. “There’s the Monster Wolf I knew, the reason I chose you over all of the others to lead our brothers in the Fraternal Order of TFU. Your subordinate has a gift for you, don’t you Ryan? Something you saw and immediately thought fit your leader, wasn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded enthusiastically as he started approaching Logan, simultaneously grabbing the harness from the bag, placing the bag on the desk, and handing the harness over to Logan whose eyes widened in surprise and delight.<br />
<br />
Immediately Logan grabbed the harness, pulling it in closer to himself, and unknowingly started feeling the harness’ power latching onto him. “Holy fucking shit! No fucking way! A Master Wolf Harness… that was at your shop Grant?! How the fuck did the owner even come across this?” Logan asked as he didn’t hesitate to slip the harness over his large frame, over his clothes, and stood proud, chest barreled out, and looked like a barbarian lord ready to make everyone he felt was his lesser submit.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I don’t know. The owner didn’t know how it got there either. One day it just showed up in a shipment. He believes it came in the massive box that he acquired from another sex shop’s closeout, though he’s not sure. Quite the surprise, huh? Looks good on you and I knew about your interest in these rare gems and I am glad you can finally have one!” Grant said as Logan wore it proudly.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, man! Didn’t they only make like… a few of these? Rumor was they made it from some strange animal leather they found, an animal they thought was a wolf, but was far too big to be a wolf. According to the same rumor, the other harness that was made turned the guy who wore it into a monster… something similar to the beast they made the harness from.” Logan said as his eyes started turning far more blood red, drool started to pour from the cleft of his mouth as each of his words ended with what sounded slightly like pleasured snarls.<br />
<br />
“Yeah and as far as I know Logan… that’s the only other one in existence. No one knows if the rumors were true, but they said they destroyed the harnesses just in case. Guess that one missed it’s destruction date.” Grant mused as Ryan just stood there, enraptured, noticing Logan slowly turning into a monster as his cock was throbbing hard in his pants.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, that’s probably for the best…” He said with a grinning growl, beckoning for Ryan to approach him, “... can’t exactly be a Master when you have someone else around that can directly oppose you, can you?”<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled and happily stepped his gait up to answer Logan&#39;s call. “Y-yes Sir?” Ryan stammered, not sure how things were going to go, but figured it would be better than standing put and disobeying the big guy.<br />
<br />
Logan grinned, showing off the teeth that were becoming something different in his mouth as his face was already starting to look a bit… puffy; the area of his mouth started distending, his nose flattening slightly, his ears gaining slightly pointed tips, his fangs starting to come in and caused the gums to bleed as the lining broke as his face was shifting and his eye color shifted permanently to a luminous crimson… though that may change in time. “So pup… was it you who found such a wonderful gift for the leader of our fraternity?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes Sir, I did. It just sort of… called to me… when I was looking around, but I didn’t feel right taking it for myself.” Ryan answered truthfully but then continued. “I… honestly… wanted to give it to Grant and submit myself to him, but you’re the Master of the house, of the Fraternity, and I pledged my life to the frat… which also means it has been pledged to you. I felt it was only right for you to wear it, Sir.”<br />
<br />
Grinning from pointed ear to pointed ear, Logan looked over to Grant and saw him silently nod, affirming Ryan’s answer. Logan beckoned for Ryan to approach, his upturned hand thicker, darkening pads of flesh adorned his palms, blood dripping down each of his digits… most of which were curled toward his wrist as his black, curled and sharp claws broke through the human keratin and were growing out. His index finger curled upward in a beckoning motion… the only one keeping Logan’s hand from balling into a fist. As Ryan approached, he watched Logan’s body continue to get thicker. The fabric stretched to its limit, tearing on his biceps, his shoulders, and even at the bottom point of the V of the three-button sky-blue polo that he was wearing. Ryan loved that Logan’s nipples pressed against the shirt, hinting at his arousal as the room itself was gaining warmth that the air conditioner was losing to. To make things even sexier, Logan’s thick forest of manly body hair was poking through each of the tears, giving him an ever-increasing “beastial” look. Ryan felt weak in Logan’s presence, not that his strength was being sapped or anything, but Logan just exuded dominance and a heavy masculine presence that would make anyone “weak in the knees” too and Logan knew it.<br />
<br />
As Ryan stood close to the manly behemoth in front of him, Logan looked toward Grant and smiled. With a new dark, gruff, and even sinister-sounding voice, Logan spoke to Grant now. “Well… it would seem the Master of the Frat still has it, eh Grant? Finding such a good pup that wanted to serve a Master that called to him, as well as the Master he was promised to, being subservient to the Fraternal Order. What do you think I should give him as a reward for his loyalty? Should I give him to you or should I keep him for myself?” He asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
“What can I say, Logan, I am a natural dominant who knows his submissives!” Grant said with excitement but continued. “As for his reward… that’s up to you. You’re his Master and while I know I would enjoy him being mine, I think you would too.” He said, holding up the gear that he pulled from the bag with the yellow accents, revealing the kind of pup Ryan admitted to being as he walked up to Logan and stood beside him.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck yeah… I would love to own a dirty pup like him! Tell you what, how about we share him? How about I reinstate you as a co-Master of the Frat, you and I be partners like we were back in the day and we both rule over all the dirty pups we have living here… what do you say?” Logan posed, reaching out with his right hand and cupped Grant’s bulge with his hands that were slowly becoming clawed paws while using his left to tease and pinch Grant’s left nipple… the most erogenous spot on his body.<br />
<br />
Without speaking a word, Grant aggressively grabbed the back of Logan’s changing head, pulling him in for a deep, dominant kiss as their tongues vied for dominance against one another, moaning in the embrace and then roughly pulled off with a pleasurable sigh coming from each of them. “How’s that for an answer?” Grant finally asked.<br />
<br />
“Perfect! A resounding ‘Yes’ to me!” He said with a grin as the clothes tore more, revealing more of his thick-built, burly, decently tanned, and hairy body as the hair was thickening in both the individual strands itself and the density that it was covering him, starting to look more akin to fur.<br />
<br />
With things agreed upon, the only question left (for now) was, would they become regular werewolf monsters or something that came from the depths of hell? The hellish, somewhat sentient, harness was happy to make either desire real… though it was stuck between the two and needed some help to sway it from one side to the other.</p>
