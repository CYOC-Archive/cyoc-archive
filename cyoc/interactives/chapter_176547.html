<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry flexed, showcasing his shirtless physique. Jay enjoyed the view. He was drawn to him. There was no denying it. This was more than simple appreciation of the male form. He was craving it.<br />
<br />
How should Jay proceed? He didn’t know what he wanted more, to touch and fondle Terry’s muscles, or have Terry handle his body? He felt a tingling sensation. No more waiting. He threw himself at him. Jay seized him. Terry took action as well. A hand ran down Jay’s blouse.<br />
<br />
For the moment, Terry was in charge. Jay was pushed down on the couch. A little rough, but he liked that. He let Terry crawl on top of him. Terry hovered a little over Jay. So close. He could feel his breath. Warm and damp.<br />
<br />
Terry’s torso was directly above his. The difference in their frames became very apparent like this. His shoulders were so broad, and with Jay being a little narrower, the contrast was great. Hot.<br />
<br />
Jay had let Terry push him around, but he couldn’t let him have complete control. After all, they were rivals. Jay reached out and pushed Terry’s chest. He was caught off guard for a moment. A moment was all Jay needed. Quickly he pushed Terry all the way until their positions were reversed. Terry was laying on his back. Jay on top of him, pinning his arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Terry was a little flabbergasted, but he still smiled. He tried to push. Neither arm would budge. Again he tried. Jay could see Terry struggling. It seemed he was giving it his all, but the result was the same. Terry remained pinned down, a little flustered. Jay giggled. He was still strong in this form, and it felt good to show it off.<br />
<br />
“Losing to a girl? Tsk, tsk.” Jay teased.<br />
<br />
“You caught me by surprise. If we-” Terry defended himself.<br />
<br />
“Your fault for letting your guard down.” Jay laughed. “Now. It’s time for my victory prize.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, he relaxed, releasing his grip of Terry. He didn’t push back. He remained on his back. Jay ran his fingers down Terry’s pecs. He brushed over his nipple. Was it sensitive for him? Probably not. Fingers moved further down his torso, taking extra time to feel his hard abs. There. It was closer now. He moved a little to the side. He circled his target. Terry was enthralled. Jay closed in. Both hands were used to release it from pants and underwear. There it was. Terry’s cock. Quite impressive. He closed in further. He parted his lips. Around it. In his mouth. Half of it in. Anything more and he might gag.<br />
<br />
Jay didn’t quite know what he was doing, but he kept that inside. His act was confident. His movements were deliberate. Slow and sensual. He was putting on a show. That’s half the fun.<br />
<br />
What caught Jay off guard was just how intense this was. The musky scent filling his nose. His narrow field of vision. Terry’s dick. Deeper. Fuck. He was about to gag. He shot back up. He coughed, eyes turning a little wet.<br />
<br />
“Am I too big?” Terry proudly laughed.<br />
<br />
Jay collected himself. Terry had a cocky grin. Jay wanted to wipe that smirk off his face. He bent back down. He wouldn’t lose.<br />
<br />
Again he sucked. He tried using a little tongue, gently touching his head. It didn’t taste good, but yet he liked it. He continued. Hands too. One around the base, the other cupping his balls. He pressed a little harder with his tongue.<br />
<br />
Soon, he felt it pulsate in his mouth,  a precursor of what was to come, and it came. He didn’t let go. He let the salty liquid fill his mouth. He kept on until there was no more coming, and not until then did he let go. He swallowed, almost gagging again, but he  pulled through. Not the most pleasant taste, but it all filled him with a strange sense of pride. It was just his first time, and he’d done such a good job. Terry was completely out of breath. He was done. Of course a man would know how to please another man. They had a frame of reference that women did not. An idea came to mind. He looked at Terry and smiled slyly.<br />
<br />
For now, he should probably call it. He walked off the couch and picked up his discarded blouse and bra. Quickly he redressed himself. He pulled up his phone, and opened the front camera, having it act as a mirror. His hair was a mess. His makeup, while a little smeared, had held itself surprisingly well. Kudos to Maria. He just had to wipe away the drop of cum in the corner of his mouth and he looked almost presentable.<br />
<br />
“Jaya.” Terry was panting. “I have to see you again.”<br />
<br />
“Oh we will.” Jay giggled.<br />
<br />
Of course they would see each other again. The question was how. Would it just be “Jaya” and Terry again, or would there be a different configuration? Not that Jay would mind some kind of repeat. This was intense, but there was plenty more he wanted to check out.<br />
<br />
Jay left the room, letting the mostly naked Terry rest on the couch.</p>
