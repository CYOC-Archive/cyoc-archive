<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Justin made his way back up to his room, he could hear the creaking of floorboards underneath another set of footsteps. It was then that he realized that it wasn&#39;t only his mother&#39;s height that had changed, but her physique as well. Her clothes were stretched tight against her skin as muscles rippled and bulged from beneath them. She seemed completely unaware of the transformation, humming softly to herself as she went about preparing dinner before reality shifted and she was now lifting weights in her home gym. Justin couldn&#39;t help but tiptoe out of his room and stare in disbelief at what was happening before him. He knew he should be happy with the results, after all, this is exactly what the Chronivac was meant for - complete control over another being&#39;s physical appearance - but something didn&#39;t feel right. Maybe it was because he hadn&#39;t fully thought through all of the implications of these changes and barely had a hand in it. As if reading his thoughts, his mother suddenly exclaimed “Oh no! These pants are getting too small!”  Her voice sounded deeper than normal and Justin watched in shock as seams began to split open along her thighs and hips. “Uh…Mom” stammered Justin nervously. “Are you feeling okay?”<br />
 “Yes honey”, said his mother absentmindedly while tugging at her shirt sleeves which are hugging tightly around the biceps which have now become noticeably bigger and more toned. Why do you ask?” <br />
“Well…” started Justin hesitantly before quickly changing course “I just noticed your hair looks great today.” His compliment seemed genuine enough and momentarily seems to take any suspicion away from himself.<br />
<br />
Emma smiled appreciatively at her son&#39;s compliment. “Thank you, little man.”  she said, her voice now deeper than before. She stretched her arms and let out a contented sigh as she felt the power coursing through her new body. “Mommy needs to change into something more comfortable.” she continued with a wink. Justin watched in stunned silence as his once petite mother seemed to grow taller and bulkier right before his eyes. As Emma headed towards her bedroom he couldn&#39;t help but feel that things were changing between them. When Emma returned moments later wearing a bikini that struggled to contain her muscular frame Justin was floored by how different she looked. Her breasts had diminished greatly while muscles rippled across what was left of them beneath the straps keeping it together. “Like what you see?” asked Emma flirtatiously, striking various muscle poses and flexing for him in an obviously suggestive manner popping her pecs for him in a very suggestive manner. Justin&#39;s heart raced as he watched his mother showing off her new physique - something about this felt so wrong but so thrilling at the same time. “I… umm… I don&#39;t know…” stammered Justin nervously, unsure how to react around this new version of his mom who seemed to act bolder every moment their interaction continued. “Well then maybe mommy can convince you otherwise.” said Emma with a sly grin as she approached him menacingly, still flexing and posing in front of him trying to intimidate him just enough until he gave in acknowledgment watching as very deep grooves became increasingly noticeable as she flexed her glutes bent forward for him.<br />
<br />
Emma giggled as she flexed her ass cheeks she caught on and could feel herself growing even more muscular now as she posed for her son. The added mass made her look even more masculine, with thicker eyebrows and a dusting of light hair appearing on her upper lip. Emma still couldn&#39;t shake the thrill of showing off in front of her son, baiting him ever so slightly with suggestive comments.  “Come on Justin don&#39;t be shy..”  said Emma, noticing how nervous he was getting at the sight before him.  “Mommy&#39;s just trying to have some fun with you!”  Justin tried to keep his composure but he couldn&#39;t help but notice the way his mother seemed to enjoy making him uncomfortable. Her body language had completely shifted since becoming more muscular - she swaggered around like a man and commanded attention as if she were used to being in charge everywhere she went. “ I… I don&#39;t know what to say.” stammered Justin awkwardly, feeling trapped by his increasingly seductive mom. Emma smirked knowingly at that response - it was clear enough that Justin wasn&#39;t quite ready for everything that might come next from here forward although His eyes kept flickering repeatedly between two competing focal points: the shapeless expanse of wall behind her where there mere paint should have taken up space versus those suddenly swollen biceps teasingly flexing right in front of them both side by side highlighting every fiber reaching northwards atop their new hardened peaks marked abundantly against paper thin skin glistening heavily against nearby sources natural house light.<br />
<br />
Emma continued to flex for Justin, enjoying the power and control she felt over her growing son. The changes continued to manifest in her body, as her voice cracked one final time into a deeper gravely register. She leaned in closer to him, watching his eyes dart nervously between her biceps and the wall behind her. “Come on Justin..” she whispered seductively. “Don&#39;t be afraid of Mommy&#39;s new muscle. You know you like it.”  Justin tried to pull away slightly, but he couldn&#39;t deny that there was something exciting about his mother&#39;s transformation. He could feel himself getting more aroused by the second as Emma leaned even closer, her musky scent filling his nostrils. “I… I don&#39;t know what you want from me.” he muttered weakly. Emma chuckled softly at Justin&#39;s innocence.  “Isn&#39;t it obvious?” she purred, running a hand over one of her bulging fuzzy pecs. “I want you to worship this new body of mine… with your hands… with your mouth..” Justin gulped audibly as he realized what his mother was suggesting. His heart raced faster than ever before as he found himself unable to resist anymore, drawn inexorably towards the powerful woman towering above him. “But first let’s get some tacos a growin’ gals gotta eat!”<br />
<br />
Emma continued to boast about her newfound muscular strength and kegel muscles, flexing her bulging biceps and running a hand over the large clit bulge in the front of her bikini bottoms. As she talked, Justin noticed something strange happening - Emma&#39;s speech began to slow down, becoming sluggish and riddled with expletives and crude language delivered with a valley girl speech affectation. “Wowwweeeeee tiny boy!” said Emma, slurring her words slightly. “You fuckin’ really think I&#39;ve grown?” Justin tried to keep up with his mother&#39;s shifting personality but found himself getting more confused by the second as she grew larger right before his eyes. Her once skimpy bikini repaired itself suddenly becoming even smaller allowing for very little coverage of her massive physique with clit and nipples barely covered. “Yeah mom… you&#39;re like… 8 feet tall now.”  replied Justin, struggling not to let his nerves get the better of him. Emma giggled maniacally at this response, bouncing her veiny barn door pecs absentmindedly completely in love with herself. “Oh sweetie pie honey bear little baby cakes fuck-muffin, crooned .” Emma in a growling deep voice.” I&#39;ve always been this tall! You must have been asleep or somethin’.” She leaned in closer to Justin again despite their height difference that seemed insurmountable yet moving forward seemingly became more possible every time he would notice how lively Emma had become through all these changes. “I bet you wanna see Mommy show off some more huh? You will, now be a good little fucker and buy her some tacos this little ol’ thang don’t got no pockets!”</p>
