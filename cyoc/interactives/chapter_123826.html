<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie anxiously glanced down the road awaiting Mary&#39;s arrival. She had sent a text message giving her location. Mary in turn said she was en route and would be there shortly. When Katie asked how they were going to avoid the power of the ring, Mary said they had it covered. Katie wasn&#39;t entirely sure how but she presumed it had something to do with the magic shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie can I ask you a question,&quot; an increasing bubbly Sofia asked. Katie turned and looked the now 42 year old woman over. Sofia seemed to be bouncing with renewed energy as she got younger. &quot;Sure Sofia what&#39;s on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia smiled warmly as she looked around. &quot;Well I&#39;m just curious,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed a weird sort of tickle every so often. It feels nice and kinda makes me giggle. And shiver. And I don&#39;t know what else. I&#39;m not very good at really explaining things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie cut her off. &quot;That tingle is you getting younger,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Every time you get younger you feel that sensation. Basically each time you feel it you get a year younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia stared wide eyed at Katie. &quot;Wow,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So I can actually figure out how old I am by the tingle?&quot; Katie nodded. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; Sofia exclaimed as she began hoping in place. &quot;So how old am I now then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked over Sofia with a critical eye. She was getting pretty good at determining people&#39;s age at this point. By her calculations she figured Sofia was around 40 by now. &quot;Id say 40,&quot; she said flatly. Sofia nodded before shivering slightly. Looking over herself she smiled broadly. &quot;I just felt the shiver again,&quot; she said with a giggle. &quot;Happy 39th birthday, woohoo!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m glad your enjoying this Sofia but maybe you should head home before you get too young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia shook her head vigorously. &quot;No way,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the most fun I&#39;ve had in years. Besides I really want to meet your friends. You seem like such a sweet girl I can only imagine what their like. And I promised I would keep you company until they arrive. That person you said started this could still be looking for you,&quot; Sofia shivered again and giggled. &quot;Wooo 38! This is so awesome! Kids still say awesome right, I thought they still did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and sighed as Sofia continued to talk. She was beginning to worry about when Mary would arrive. Sofia was continueing to grow younger and more hyperactive. Even worse she wanted to become younger, which surprised her. Could Katie had been fated to meet Sofia like she had been fates to meet the others. It was something she hadn&#39;t considered until now. As she listened to Sofia shout out numbers in reverse she began to believe that maybe she had run into for a reason. Katie shuddered though, Sofia was going to be a handful no matter how young she became.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, with Sofia shouting out numbers with increasing energy, Katie could finally see the car approaching. Sighing with relief she turned to look at Sofia and was shocked by what she saw. Sofia was now only 30 years old. The woman before her was a very attractive woman with shoulder length sandy brown hair and glimmering green eyes. Her abundant energy and flawless skin made her seem younger than she was yet she maintained the features of an adult woman beginning her 30s. The sweater she wore hugged her large c cup breasts and accentuated her curves. The jeans seemed a little tight on her legs now as she had regained muscle mass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Katie look,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m 30 again. Just a little bit more and I&#39;ll be your age and then a teenager. This is amazing, I&#39;m wondering if I should get even younger than my 20s. I mean if I do I would probably have to go back to school. Not that I hated school, I loved it. Especially elementary school. Wow would I really want to be a school girl again. That would be interesting. If I get that young am I going to get shorter? I guess I could buy a new wardrobe but who would take care of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie put her hand on Sofias shoulder. &quot;Sofia focus,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;We can cross that bride in a moment. Right now my sister is almost here.. if you want to stay like this you can go otherwise you take the chance of becoming a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia looked at the car before looking at Katie. From Katie&#39;s perspective she almost seemed to be jumping with energy. &quot;No, I&#39;m okay,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m just super excited. Sorry that happens sometimes.&quot; Sofia shivered and giggles slightly. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m 29 again,&quot; Sofia leapt into Katie&#39;s arms giving the shocked woman a giant hug. &quot;Cmon Katie what are we waiting for,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I really would love to meet your sister and her friends. If I end up back in preschool well then so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gave Sofia a bewildered look. Somehow Sofia was a part of this now whether she liked it or not. Turning towards the street Katie could see Mary was driving. Keeping a safe distance from the car Katie waved in her direction. Mary exited the car with a wave and a smile. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Katie,&quot; Mary yelled. &quot;We won&#39;t be affected, we have something to help plus we brought a friend.&quot; Curiously Katie watched as an elderly man exited the passenger seat. &quot;Hello Katie I&#39;m Merlin,&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Sofia bolted past Katie hugging Mary and shaking Merlins hand vigorously. &quot;Oh hi you two,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;My names Sofia. I just met Katie not too long ago. I used to be old, like 88 but now I&#39;m 29 thanks to Katie.&quot; Sofia shivered slightly. &quot;Well I was 29,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Now I&#39;m 28. Isn&#39;t this exciting I had no idea people could actually become younger. So your Katie&#39;s sister. Funny you two don&#39;t really look alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary had a bewildered look on her face as she looked at Katie. Katie just shook her head and mouthed the words don&#39;t ask. Sofia hugged Mary again before turning to Merlin. &quot;So who are you?&quot; She asked. &quot;Are you Katie&#39;s grandfather or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled at the energetic young woman. &quot;No child my name is Merlin,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;I guess you could say I&#39;m the reason you&#39;ve regained your, shall we say, youthful energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia gaped and smiled her goofy smile at Merlin. &quot;Wow your a wizard,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;That&#39;s amazing I had no idea. I can&#39;t believe I got to meet a real life wizard. I guess I should thank you for making me 28 again.&quot; Sofia shivered again. &quot;I mean 27 now,&quot; she smiled.<br />
<br />
Mary approached Katie with a look of concern. &quot;So is everything alright,&quot; she asked. &quot;Your call had me worried, and I must say I wasn&#39;t expecting you to have a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Kati sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you about it tonight. By the way how is it that your not affected by the rings power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled. &quot;Well that&#39;s Merlins doing,&quot; she said. &quot;He gave us a few items to protect us from the out of control nature of the ring. Well not so much gave, we bought them. Cost me about two months allowance. Now we have to turn it off so it can get back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How,&quot; Katie asked. Merlin approached Katie with a warm smile. &quot;Well my dear,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s actually a fairly simple bit of magic. It just has to be performed by someone you trust.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked suspiciously at Merlin. &quot;Well no offense but I don&#39;t know you so how can I trust you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no my dear,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;I wont be the one performing the magic. My new apprentice will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gave Merlin a confused look as Merlin made his way to the backdoor. Opening the door Merlin smiled as his new apprentice emerged. A look of shock and joy spreading over Katie&#39;s  face.</p>
