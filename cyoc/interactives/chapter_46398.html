<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And Pirouette,&quot; the voice of the instructor called out and without thinking about it, Richard moved in a small circle along with the rest of the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; the instructor replied and then, &quot;Girls...For tonight I want you try and work on the moves you've learned today. Try and combine them with the ones you have been taught over the course of the past lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fat chance,&quot; Richard thought as he moved with the rest of the girls into the locker room.<br />
<br />
Gazing at the mirror as he passed, he sighed as he saw his reflection and how much he had changed just in the last two days. &quot;This is getting out of hand,&quot; he thought as he ran a hand through the soft fur that now covered his head.<br />
<br />
Two days ago, he had woken up to find that he was now expected to attend the local middle school and do so with everyone thinking he was actually a she. What made matters stranger was that his clothes, except for his underwear, still remained those that belonged to a young male. His underwear was simply gone and Richard wasn't sure how to broach the subject with his mother.<br />
<br />
To top it all off, he finally figured out what else was changing. Granted it took him a full day to see it, but in the end...when confronted by his first Ballet lesson...Richard saw the first of what was soon to become a full head of white fur.<br />
<br />
The next day, he was still in middle school, but this time he had to wear a dress...but still no underwear. After school, he was confronted by another Ballet lesson and the instructor treated him as if he was just starting. This, Richard thought, had something to do with the wish and until his transformation was complete, he would continue to keep experiencing the first class over and over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I can't remember what I learned the day before,&quot; Richard thought as he followed the rest of the girls into the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Melissa,&quot; a voice called out a greeting and without thinking about it, Richard turned to the speaker...a three year old named Julie...and responded back with a hello.<br />
<br />
Stripping off the leotard and tights, Richard followed Julie toward the showers and as he stood beneath the water, the young girl asked him, &quot;How are you liking your first Ballet class. I know my mum can be hard, but you'll get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and instead let the water run over his naked flesh, enjoying for some reason the feeling of it against his female privates.<br />
<br />
If there was one thing Richard was getting used to, it was learning to adjust. Even if he was just along for the ride and he had no control over what was happening. Looking over at the younger girl, Richard smiled and replied, &quot;She's cool. I am actually enjoying myself,&quot; which was true...even if it was true that he didn't want to be a girl and that he written the wish so his mom could be happy.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Richard dressed in a pair of jeans, which he thought to be a bit odd because the button to fasten them was in back and it left a round hole situated at the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
Thinking about this for a moment, it took him a moment to figure out that this was so his tail...whenever it decided to grow in...could sit comfortably why he wore jeans. Sighing, he wished Julie a good evening and exited the dance studio.<br />
<br />
Outside, his mom was waiting and climbing in the passenger side, he listened as she immediately asked, &quot;Did you enjoy your first lesson, Melissa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, he replied, &quot;Yes mommy,&quot; and looked out the window as they pulled out of the parking lot and began the drive home.<br />
<br />
Home, Richard's mom already had dinner ready and the two sat down to a dinner of fruits and vegetables, something Richard thought was odd at first and then a small voice explained that this was what he normally ate for meals.<br />
<br />
After dinner, Richard excused himself to his room and inside he dropped down in the seat in front of his desk and began to work on his homework. Half an hour later, he stood, stretched and headed for the bathroom. Inside, he gazed into the mirror, trying to ascertain if anything had changed.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he went to the toilet and sat down to complete his business. When he finished, he returned to work on the rest of his homework...something he just couldn't keep his mind on and around nine thirty his mother gave him an excuse to quit when she announced that he needed to start getting ready for bed. Sighing, he replied, &quot;Yes mom,&quot; and slid his books back into the backpack.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Richard lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Through his head thousands of questions raced...but he had not a single answer to any of them. Shifting, he felt the nightgown he was wearing brush against his body and more question surged forth.<br />
<br />
Question after question raced through his head and after what seemed like hours...though it was really only about fifteen minutes...Richard eventually drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Morning came with the sound of an alarm clock going off and blinking the sleep out of his eyes, Richard slapped the snooze button...only to be promptly told, &quot;Don't let me catch you going back to sleep, Melissa. I do not want a repeat of yesterday and find out you missed the bus again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blinking some more, Richard kicked back the Hello Kitty sheets and comforter and rolled out of bed. Stumbling over to the dresser, he stopped as he passed the mirror.<br />
<br />
Stepping back, he tilted his head one way and then another. After a couple of seconds of doing this, Richard realised that his ears where now on top of his head. &quot;In fact,&quot; he thought, &quot;They look more like a mouse's ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about this struck him funny and he would have giggled out loud if he hadn't discovered to other things. The first was that his nightgown was moving strangely in the back and shifting about and then lifting the evening dress, Richard discovered he now had a rather short, bald, pink tail extending from the base of his spine.<br />
<br />
The second thing that caught his attention was his backpack and the items poking out of it. Investigating, Richard discovered that he regressed some more in age over night and it was apparent that he now attended the elementary school, sixth grade.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Richard reminded himself, &quot;Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Because you have to way to control it.&quot; and with this thought in mind, he began to get ready for the day ahead and whatever changes that might come with it...including that real good possibility that he'll have another first day of Ballet lessons.</p>
