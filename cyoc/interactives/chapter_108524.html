<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was too caught up in the heat of the moment to - as he studied the screen of the malfunctioning Chronivac - know what the ramifications were of the mental ages of his co-workers being unaffected and yet all of them being unaware of the shift in reality that had occurred. He got his first inkling of what exactly that entailed when Rick came up to him right after he was relieved of his &quot;toy,&quot; patting him on the shoulder and giving him a big bright smile of perfect little baby teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bummah, Jakey.&quot; Though Rick&#39;s voice was very much a toddler&#39;s lispy squeak, he otherwise spoke with perfect adult cadence. &quot;Maybe he&#39;ll gif it back to you way-tah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob could do nothing but gawk at his best friend as he left Jacob&#39;s side to toddle over to Dave and Kris, who were already sitting on their padded bottoms in the middle of the room. Rick settled down on his own poofy tush and joined their conversation, which sounded perfectly adult from where Jacob was standing. They talked about TV and sports and the only thing differentiating it from a normal grown-up chat was the chirpy little voices through which the exchange was held - and the fact that little Kris, sitting in nothing but his diaper, had to pluck his thumb from his lips whenever he wanted to say something. <br />
<br />
Though his mind reeled and his stomach churned, Jacob eventually focused himself enough to head over to the circle of his former co-workers. Outwardly he cringed at the crinkling that every step produced, at the feel of the soft, cushy material of his Pampers smooshing between his chubby little thighs. But inwardly - in spite of how terribly this whole thing had spiraled out of control - the part of him that had wanted this since Kindergarten was enjoying every second. Try as he might to focus on the moment, every so often he got a little shiver of pleasure from the thought that he was a tiny little baby boy wearing nothing but a diaper and a Pokemon t-shirt, that his co-workers had become just as immature and adorable as he was. It wasn&#39;t until he stood before them that he got himself together enough to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...&quot; He blushed and cleared his throat, still not accustomed to his babyish squeak. &quot;What&#39;s wif you guys? Don&#39;t you know that you&#39;re supposta be adults?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;We <i>are</i> adults, siwwy,&quot; Dave said as he rolled his eyes. &quot;You know what James aw-ways says. &#39;Iss da man inside dat counts.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just &#39;cause we wook wike babies...an&#39; act wike dem sometimes...&quot; Another round of giggles as Rick chimed in. &quot;Don&#39;t mean we&#39;re <i>weawwy</i> babies. Da viwus can&#39;t take dat fwom uth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ith da beth thing that evah happened to uth,&quot; Kris piped up, popping his thing back in his mouth as the other two murmured their assent. <br />
<br />
Jacob could only stare open-mouthed at the trio as the conversation returned to the topic from which it had been diverted. A virus? Did that mean that in this reality the four of them had been infected with something that returned them to mental but not physical toddlerhood? <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait wait wait.&quot; Jacob waved his pudgy hands as the trio frowned at him. &quot;You&#39;re sayin&#39; dat we useta be adults and dat a viwus turned us into babies - and dat you&#39;re aw gwad it happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
His baby co-workers looked at each other, the concern evident in their cute little faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Jakey, aw you okay?&quot; Rick finally said. &quot;You&#39;re usuawwy da happiest guy here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris agreed. &quot;You got useta bein&#39; a baby quickah dan any of uth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were usin&#39; your dipee da vewy next day. It took us awmost a week ta wea-wize how nice dey feel.&quot; A naughty grin suddenly spread across Dave&#39;s lips. &quot;Speakin&#39; of...&quot;<br />
<br />
The oldest of the babies closed his eyes as Jacob flushed scarlet at the (logical, but still embarrassing) revelation that in this reality  he had taken to his diapers like a duck to water. So distracted was he by the ramifications of this realization that he almost didn&#39;t notice the soft hiss that emerged from Dave&#39;s direction, one that he knew all too well from his own experiments with adult diapers. Dave - his esteemed, elderly co-worker turned precious little baby boy - was not only wetting himself, but - if the dreamy smile that split his rosy cheeks was any indication - loving every second of it. Jacob&#39;s hypothesis regarding the absorbency of Dave&#39;s underwear proved to be accurate, as nothing but the barest rash of wetness showed up on the front of his short-alls despite the impressive length of the toddler&#39;s bladder-emptying. And all of this occurred while Rick and Kris looked on in...was that...admiration? Seemingly out of ammo, Dave finally sighed and settled back onto his seat, cooing in pleasure as he rocked back and forth on his drenched bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naith one,&quot; Rick grinned right before closing his own eyes and joining the fun started by his slightly older companion. With his best friend&#39;s diaper out in the open, Jacob could watch - he couldn&#39;t help but watch - as the first drops soaked into the front of Rick&#39;s puffy undies. The trickle became a flow became a deluge, Rick&#39;s tiny little toes curling into the carpet as diaper grew wetter and yellower, sagging and losing shape as the delighted toddler flooded it, growing so saturated that Jacob feared it might start leaking onto the carpet. The diaper held firm, though, and instead of leaking provided a squelching bubble of pleasure that was - if Rick&#39;s blissful giggles were any indication - just as enjoyable as Dave&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Kris beamed around his thumb as he  watched his friends wet themselves, never saying a word. He remained silent as he plucked the sodden digit from his lips and went onto all fours, closing his eyes as Rick and Dave did but also donning a look of perfectly adorable determination as he did so. A second later a third hiss pierced the air, but Kris only twisted his features tighter - releasing them in infantile ecstasy only when it became apparent just what it was he was trying to achieve. Jacob actually gasped a little as he watched the littlest baby of the four push a soft mass into the seat of his diaper, the garment&#39;s puffy bottom rapidly expanding to accommodate Kris&#39; efforts. Every babyish grunt was accompanied by an equally babyish squeal of joy as the once-white Pampers sagged lower and lower between his pudgy thighs, the size of the mess so great that the exterior of the padded plastic garment holding it sank into the carpet. Finally, Kris was done - and he immediately rolled onto his back and jammed his foot in his mouth, sucking on his toes as his eyelids fluttered in pure pleasure, as he smooshed around in the mess he had made for himself.<br />
<br />
Dave and Rick had wet themselves. Kris had done that <i>and</i> pooped his pants. And every one of them were soaking in the pleasure given to them by such infantile acts. Jacob had watched the spectacle in such a daze that it wasn&#39;t Kris finished that he realized what he had done in reaction to such a perfect realization of his fantasy. His tiny hand had snuck into his diaper and started tugging on his tinier penis, a stiff little rod pulsing with the deepest need he had ever felt. It wasn&#39;t until he came back to himself that he realized just how small his little baby dick was, a realization that pulled out a high-pitched moan of humiliation but also made him hornier than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jakey&#39;s pwayin&#39; wif himself,&quot; Rick sing-songed, bringing the other two out of their reverie long enough to giggle at their blushing friend. Jacob whined and squirmed but couldn&#39;t take his hand out of his diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usuawwy you don&#39;t do dat &#39;til <i>aftah</i> you go,&quot; Dave snickered. <br />
<br />
&quot;But if he&#39;s doin&#39; it, dat means we don&#39; hafta wait, right?&quot; Kris asked.<br />
<br />
The other boys voiced their agreement - and then reached into their own diapers. They murmured and bit their lips as they tugged on their stiff little dinkies with almost as much need as Jacob had exhibited - while Kris started humping the carpet, eyes closed and tongue lolling out as his messy, diapered bottom bounced in the air. What happened before him was so wild, so ridiculous, so in line with his deepest and darkest fantasies that Jacob felt as though reality was falling apart around him. Every impulse of his chubby little baby body compelled him to join his friends, to take part in the realization of a dream, to take what he had wanted ever since he had learned what masturbation was. But his mind screamed at him that none of this was real, that he had to find a way to get out of this mess, that his friends - happy as they might seem - didn&#39;t deserve to be reduced to his personal spank material.<br />
<br />
And so, after much consideration, the toddler whose hand gripped his stiff little pee-pee as he watched his friends pleasure themselves decided to...</p>
