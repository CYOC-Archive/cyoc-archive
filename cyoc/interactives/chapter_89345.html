<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the house of their former Master, the first thing the New Perths did was begin an inspection of it.  Beginning with the porch and hallway they had entered which they noticed held a number of coats, shoes and boots of differing sizes.  Left of it and they toured the kitchen and dining room, a hint of disgust at the sizable portions of processed meat they came across in the fridge/freezer.  Opposite that showed them the commodious lounge where she spent some time looking around, running a hand over some of the furnishings and decorations - and the carpeted floor being more welcome to her cold feet.  Up the stairs and they found the bedrooms, the one where they determined that their old owner and wife slept being an en-suite, with Kelly’s nearby and two unused.  <br />
<br />
“So this is how they live.”  He stated with some scorn.  “All this luxury they have, while we’ve been freezing half the time in those barns.”  He added, hands pressing into his bare sides.  <br />
<br />
“I know that.”  She countered while she was looking at her reflection in the full-length mirror that made one of the wardrobe doors in the master bedroom, rubbing her more delicate hands over her naked human body a little wistfully.  “But some of them WERE a lot kinder towards us.  John for example, he’s the reason we didn’t have to deal with those cold drafts anymore.  And the other one, Aki, wasn’t so bad either.”  <br />
<br />
“Perhaps, but too many see us as just tools for their own use.”  He returned.  “Those like the old, “master”, and his wife.  Daniel.  Kelly.  All those who use us as beasts of burden, for races, all of it.  They’re not going to be allowed to get away with it.”  <br />
<br />
“But NOT, all of them.”  She disputed his clear desire as she sat down on the corner of the king-size bed, her fingers running just by the base of her spine.  “Those who have mistreated us, certainly, they should be made to learn the consequences.  But the ones who actually treated us right, and really made sure to take proper care of us, I don’t want to see them suffer for the actions committed by the ones who misused us.”  She ended with a sigh.  <br />
<br />
“Alright, I’m going to another room, keep an eye out for when Daniel, and Eclipse return.”  He offered by way of truce as he turned to leave her alone with her thoughts for the time being.  <br />
<br />
In truth, he didn’t quite get why she was trying to defend them, if only a select group.  Perhaps she missed her horse form?  Given the way he’d seen her looking at herself, a raised leg when he’d left, it was possible.  He knew, that he didn’t like his current human penis, rather too small for his liking.  What he clearly wasn’t aware of was that six inches while flaccid was in reality, an extremely impressive size for a human penis which less than a handful could realistically best.  <br />
<br />
‘Perhaps I’ll reclaim it later.’  He thought to himself as he looked out of the window, this one offering a direct line of sight to the drive that let the cars and cabs in and out of here, which would let him know the instant that Daniel or indeed anyone else came in.  ‘And besides, she didn’t say anything nice about that wife or Kelly.’  He added mentally as he decided they’d be just as good targets if they beat Daniel here.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
She’d spent the last several minutes looking at herself, sometimes in the mirror, sometimes just looking, getting a feel for how this new human body of hers operated.  But the truth was, it felt like there was…something…missing.  She couldn’t quite find the words for it, and eventually settled for it being just her missing her original form too much at the moment.  Missing her flowing mane and tail, her long beautiful face, and rich cream-white fur.  <br />
<br />
And there was something else gnawing away at her.  From where she stood, he really seemed determined to make every single human pay for the misdeeds of a select few.  That was something she couldn’t bring herself to support.  True, for the ones who had been cruel towards them, had treated them poorly there needed to be a reckoning.  But she couldn’t condone targeting the innocent ones for retribution.  <br />
<br />
She was worried, about what would happen if he went too far.  Those were the thoughts running through her mind as she lay on the bed, a hand slowly running the length of her body.  She just hoped that either he or she’d be able to rein him in before things got out of hand.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
He’d spent the last several minutes waiting, pacing the room from time to time as his patience slowly began to wear thin.  And what she’d said had been eating away at him during that time.  <br />
<br />
‘I know she means well, but she’s got to understand just how many of them only see us as tools for their use and entertainment.’  He sought to convince himself as a means of passing the time.  ‘Maybe some of them aren’t so bad, but so many more are, and they NEED to be made to understand the reality of what they’ve been doing to us.’  <br />
<br />
His pacing had had his cock bouncing off his legs, and looking at it, he did feel some need for his old, familiar “goods”.  <br />
<br />
‘If it gets to be too much, I’ll think about it.’  He decided as he returned to gaze out of the window, finally seeing the sight of someone enter the grounds.  &quot;So?  Who are you?&quot;</p>
