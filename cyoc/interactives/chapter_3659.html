<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle looked her up and down with an evil grin on his face. &quot;Hi, Jennifer. What's new?&quot; He smirked at 
<br />

<br />
her, and she fumed.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You fuck, change me back right now!&quot;, she snarled, hopping at him and stopping mere inches away. He stepped back slightly and smiled.
<br />

<br />
&quot;No can do. You know that. You're stuck like that for the rest of your life, so you'd better get used to it.&quot; She began to yell about the curse, but suddenly discovered she couldn't get the words out. Puzzled, it wasn't until a couple of other students walked past that she realised that the restriction on communicating about the curse to others had gone into action. As soon as the other people were out of hearing range she was able to speak again, but by then Kyle had turned and walked away laughing.
<br />

<br />
Tense with anger, she stared after him for a moment, then turned to look at her locker. It had seemed somehow different, she had noticed when she'd arrived at it, and now she was able to inspect the difference. This took the form of a sort of electronic scanner at waist height in place of the normal lock, and the door was talled and wider than the lockers surrounding it. Curious, after a moment she reached forwards and placed a forepaw flat on the scanner. It flashed briefly, beeped twice, and the door to the locker popped open slightly. Obviously this was another change to reality provided by the curse to make everything normal to others. Without hands she was unable to operate the normal combination lock, but this electronic one was usable.
<br />

<br />
Pulling the door open with her paw, she looked inside. All her books were there, as well as a number of items she at first couldn't identify. All the books had a sort of plastic sleeve over them, with a length of stiff plastic cable protruding up along the spine past the top for about 6 inches, where it formed a three-inch loop. She wondered what this was in aid of for a moment, then realised with a jolt that the loops of plastic were in fact handles that could be used by a paw. Reaching out, she put her right paw through the loop of the chemistry book, and found she could indeed pick the book up. 
<br />

<br />
She wondered how she was supposed to carry more than two books, then noticed the photos stuck to the inside of the locker door. There were a number of them, some showing friends of hers, and a couple with her in her new body in them. This was perhaps the wierdest thing about the whole curse, since she remembered the photos being taken, but she had been a normal human when this happened. However, in all the photos she was portrayed as she was now, although she saw than in some of them she was wearing a huge halter-top covering her breasts. This was still a little unusual, because it had holes for her outsize nipples to stick through.
<br />

<br />
The thing she saw in one photo, though, was the answer to her question. She was portrayed in it standing with her friends Kim and Amanda, both of whom were clutching a stack of half a dozen books. She remembered that she and the others had just been to the library when that picture was taken by another friend, and she herself had also had a number of books in her arms. Now, though, she saw that there were six or seven of the book-handles protruding from her pouch and realised that this was where she carried things. With the handle sticking out, she would be able to retrieve what she put in there, unlike with the incident a few minutes ago.
<br />

<br />
Looking down between her breasts, she pulled the top of her pouch open with her left paw and after a couple of abortive efforts managed to slide the book whose handle was still looped over her other foreleg inside. It felt odd, but wasn't nearly as distracting as the prank had been. Jennifer loaded up her pouch with the four books she needed, then looked further through the contents of the locker.
<br />

<br />
She discovered a large notebook with the same sort of handle, and an odd-looking device she eventually worked out was a sort of pen designed to fit over a couple of the stubby clawed digits on her paw. It also had a loop-handle on it, and she slipped it and the notebook into her pouch alongside the books. At the back of the locker, hanging up on a wire hanger, was a halter-top like the one she had on in the photos. She looked at it, thinking that it would be better to wear the thing and have her nipples exposed than to have her breasts flopping around on the loose, but couldn't work out how she would put it on.
<br />

<br />
Just as she was about to close the locker, Becky walked up and stopped, asking her if she was ready for class. She replied affirmatively, then had a thought and asked Becky to help her put the garment on. Her friend agreed so casually it was obvious that this was something she thought she did all the time. It was the work of a few seconds to have Becky pull the top over her head, and after she had poked and prodded the undersides of her breasts with her forepaws for a moment, she was comfortably settled in the large support cups with her nipples sticking out. They started off for the first class of the day, and she was pleased to note that her breasts no longer hurt when she hopped, although they still bounced impressively.
<br />

<br />
The first half of the day passed very slowly. She found that in every class there was a desk with a large space behind it available for her, and no chair in the way. It proved possible to write using the paw-pen, although it was a lot slower than she had once been, and her handwriting wasn't as smooth as before either. She could turn pages fairly easily, but the chemistry class showed that she had to rely on her lab partner to manipulate the equipment. It was beyond her newly limited manual dexterity.
<br />

<br />
Finally, lunch arrived, and she hopped off to the lunchroom in the company of a couple of friends. One of them casually put selections for Jennifer on her tray and took them to the table, while another brought over a special fork that the lunch-room attendant handed to her. It was set up in the same way as the paw-pen, allowing her to eat. The can of Coke she had for a drink proved surprisingly easy to handle. Someone opened it for her and dropped a straw in, then she picked it up between her paws. The girls chatted about various things, mainly boyfriends, although Jennifer stayed mostly quiet. 
<br />

<br />
After lunch was over, she was on the way out of the lunchroom when she saw Rich again. He smiled at her and waved, and she blushed as a wave of lust rolled through her causing her nipples to go rigid again. 
<br />

<br />
Becky noticed, giggled, and asked with a smile, &quot;So you're interested in Rich?&quot; Jennifer's quick denial was the trigger for lots of giggling and lwed comments from her friends, while she steaming in silence.
<br />

<br />
The rest of the afternoon was uneventful, and at around half past three she hopped out of the front door of the school, with her homework in her pouch and still wearing the halter. Her heart sank when she saw Rich leaning against the low wall in front of the school, obviously waiting for her. She wanted to make a quick getaway, but instead found herself irresistably forced to hop over and smile at him.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hi&quot;, he said with a smile of his own. &quot;Do you want to go to your place or mine?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
She found herself saying with an obvious sexual note in her voice, &quot;I think your place would be better, don't you?&quot; He nodded, thinking to himself, 'God, she really wants me.'
<br />

<br />
Jennifer was thinking something pretty much the complete opposite, but had no chance of saying as much or stopping the inevitable. They went over to Rich's car, an SUV type of vehicle. She had never much liked it, but found that it was sufficiently large that she was able to get in the back. He opened the door for her, then closed it behind her while making sure her tail was clear. by now she was no longer surprised that he wouldn't find moving a potential girlfriend's tail out of the way, and just resigned herself to whatever happened next.
<br />

<br />
The drive to his parents house only took about ten minutes, while he attempted to make interesting smalltalk and she tried to think of a way out of the situation. Nothing had come to mind by the time they arrived, and she followed him out of the car and into the house with a sense of impending doom. Rich helped her take the books and other stuff out of her pouch, then piled it on the kitchen table, before inviting her out onto the patio for a drink. &quot;My parents are away for a couple of days, so they'll never know if I open a bottle of wine.&quot; Thoughtfully he put some in a tall glass with a straw for her, rather untraditional but effective.
<br />

<br />
'Oh, hell, if this is going to happen anyway I may as well be drunk', she thought darkly, and finished off the wine in short order. He refilled her glass, and they talked about nothing much for a while. She lay down on the large beanbags that were the furniture on the pation, with her torso more or less upright. He flopped down beside her, and after a couple of glasses of wine each they were laughing in a more than slightly drunken fashion. By the time the bottle was empty, he had one hand on her breast, and ten minutes later was fumbling around removing his jeans.
<br />

<br />
It took a little work, since her sexual organs were not in the standard position, but everything seemed to work pretty much normally. She came about four times, thinking woozily that the big nipples might be an improvement. After more than an hour of sex, they both passed out.</p>
