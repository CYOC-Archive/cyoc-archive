<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hair on the back of Petula’s neck stood on end as a chill ran down her back. Creepy. She had slowed to a stop. Why did she walk into the field <br />
with Jimmy again? She couldn’t even see the road from here. She turned to look behind her. Nothing. Only grass. Trying to step forward, her legs <br />
moved like she was wading through a lake. They felt so heavy, she couldn’t move.<br />
<br />
Her heart skipped a beat when she realized another feeling. She felt… taller. And she felt a draft at her midsection. Her chest was rising upward, <br />
taking her shirt with it, leaving her skin exposed. Her navel was already peaking out from the blue polo shirt. Before long, her shins began to burn <br />
as they too started to stretch upwards, the cuffs of her jeans rising to show her bare ankles.<br />
<br />
“Jimmy, what’s happening to me?” screamed a disturbed Petula. Jimmy had no answer, he just stood in silent shock and perverse fascination.<br />
<br />
A bubbling, rippling sensation swept over her legs as individual muscles started to spasm into growth. Her spandex shorts tightened as her flesh <br />
filled all available space within them and continue to push outward. The shorts were already snuggly in place around her thighs.<br />
<br />
Her chest kept moving upward toward the sky at its slow pace while she looked down at her legs, twisting her body to see them from the left and <br />
from the right, but every angle she tried only revealed a pair of legs that were becoming increasingly less human. Her calf muscles bulged, and <br />
still she rose into the air.<br />
<br />
Pains started to emanate from her waist. Her shorts were too tight. Way too tight. The spandex groaned from the building pressure. She heard a <br />
muffled pop and gasped in relief as she felt some of the pressure drop off around the seat of her pants, only to be replaced by a nagging pinching <br />
sensation. Petula grimaced as she glanced down behind her to see strands of thick hair, course and brown, spilling out of a small hole in her <br />
pants. Much of the hair was still trapped inside, new growth spewing out with nowhere left to go. Slowly, she put her hand around the base of her <br />
tail, though she hated to think of it as that, and pulled its length out. Its unstoppable flow spilled downward and soon swished around her bare <br />
ankles.<br />
<br />
The swelling in her shorts became unbearable. Her thighs, her entire backside was inflating like a water balloon. She felt like she was going to <br />
burst! Another loud pop. Then all a sudden, all the pain ceased. Maybe it was over? No such luck. The seams on both sides of her legs had been <br />
torn apart, forming an ever-widening canyon in which dwelled her thickening, undulating flesh. The tear crept down her legs as the muscles <br />
pulled at it and her waist widened. The belt straps finally snapped away and the spandex fell around her knees, revealing a supple round rump, <br />
equipped with a fully functional brown horse’s tail. For some reason, she was glad only Jimmy could see her exposed like that. With caution, she <br />
looked down to examine herself, and discovered that she was more mare than woman. From the waist down she looked very much like a peach <br />
colored pony wearing sneakers.<br />
<br />
Sick crunching noises emanated from her joints as they repositioned along her leg, particularly from within her dirty shoes. The laces snapped, <br />
though she didn’t feel any pressure at her feet. Her foot pushed forward, breaking through the toe of the shoe, and she could see a large black <br />
substance covering the tip of it. It wiggled as her toes would, though the joint seemed to be much deeper inside the shoe than before. The dull <br />
black coating enveloped her toes, penetrating to the bone. She winced… they were hooves. She began to lose her balance as her heel melted <br />
away, being sucked into her body as the arches of her feet stretched longer, breaking though the back of her shoes as well. She tried to settle <br />
herself down, but found it too difficult with a foreign set of leg joints which didn’t function the way she expected.<br />
<br />
The tops of her shoes burst open, leaving her tottering on only the soles. Her legs wanted to balance on the hooves, her foot arches now a foot <br />
long and no longer designed to support weight in that fashion. She took in a deep breath and tried to rise on top of the hooves. She started to fall <br />
face forward toward the ground. She couldn’t stand the thought of being in a natural horse position, and instead kicked at the ground, leaping <br />
backwards and settling on top of her hooves, her arms swinging around her as she regained balance.<br />
<br />
The extra height nauseated her, and the spandex still wrapped around her legs threatened to trip her. Her stance widened as her legs moved to <br />
the sides of her massive butt, pulling at the shorts until a good kick tore it to scraps which fell to her hooves. She could only watch in silent horror <br />
as new muscle definitions spread across her legs, and then bulged into fine highlights. Her now slender legs looked more powerful than ever. She <br />
carefully placed a hand on her flank and could feel the promise of coiled strength… not something usually felt in a butt.<br />
<br />
Her lengthening spine… she had no idea if it would stop. Her shirt was still slowly moving upward over her belly. It itched now, and she scratched <br />
at it without thought. Her belly felt… furry. She moaned as she looked down to see a dark, muddy brown hair covering her navel. It spread across <br />
her abdomen like a field of grass in the wind. Beneath it, she could feel her skin becoming hard and tough. Leathery. Her legs were covered in it <br />
soon, and she felt it moving up her chest; her arms; her face… No, her changes were not nearly done. She suddenly understood that her normal <br />
life was over.<br />
<br />
Her chest billowed out, still rising from her legs. Now it was her shirt that faced the fury of Jimmy’s unknowing curse. The top two buttons popped <br />
off instantly and her bra was revealed for the entire world to see, a bra which no longer had breasts to conceal. Her arms slid forward, tearing the <br />
back of the shirt, and still her chest grew. Her belly grew plump and heavy, removing most of the remaining buttons. Her haunches exploded with <br />
muscle, no longer a miniature version, but fitting of a full grown horse. Her spine twisted to realign itself with it and she felt herself falling again.<br />
<br />
She landed on all fours; her arms seemed to fly out from her to meet the ground. Her previous revulsion returned, and she threw her body to the <br />
side. She immediately decided this was a bad move, as now she could feel every change on her body exaggerated as it pushed or slid against the <br />
grass. She shook her head violently as her own nose came into view, her skull creaking and groaning as a thick muzzle grew from her. Her cheeks <br />
and jowls fattened, inflating, her neck rising from her body, a statue of finely sculpted muscle. Her chest thrust forward, freeing itself from the <br />
futile confines of her shirt, now also in pieces on the ground. She winced as her eyes were shoved to the side by her still growing muzzle, her <br />
teeth reforming and her lips growing fat and leathery. Her nostrils flattened and flared visibly in front of her.<br />
<br />
She raised an arm into the air, and it seemed to move away from her, muscles growing and pushing it away like the pistons of a terrible machine. <br />
She gasped as her hand fell off. Or, rather, stretched fast enough to appear to do so. In a short time, her fingers had given way to a second set of <br />
hooves. Tears rolled from the giant pools that were now her eyes.<br />
<br />
Her body tensed and expanded with a force like being caught on an eternal rollercoaster. Her neck, her chest, her arms, her legs, her face… they <br />
all thickened as one now. Her head fell to the ground as she stared forward, her chest heaving with enormous lungs, as she watched the last <br />
changes: she saw the her hair, once soft and smooth, turn dark and wirily like her tail.<br />
<br />
Petula’s eyes shot open. Then she reached for her head with her hands, moaning. She couldn’t reach her head. Her hooves were too far away. The <br />
changes seemed to have been a thing of the distant past. In reality, they had probably finished within a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Her bra still covered her chest vainly, stretched to the limit. The simple act of trying to roll to her legs was all it took to do it in. Now it lay on the <br />
ground along with the other cloth imbedded into the dirt that she had once referred to as “clothes.” She rose shakily onto her legs. They were still <br />
her legs… they just looked different, right? The thought seemed to comfort her. She tried walking and fell forward. She had forgotten that she <br />
would need to walk with what she used to think of as arms, too.<br />
<br />
She sighed heavily, looking around at the field. She gave into temptation and nibbled at the grass. She hadn’t eaten today. Perhaps now she’d get <br />
a chance to survey the field, which, at least she assumed, was her home now. Being a horse wouldn’t be too bad. She was free, in a way. She <br />
grazed in the warm sunlight, her tail swishing casually behind her.</p>
