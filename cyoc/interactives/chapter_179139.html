<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours passed, although Noah had been teasing Daniel by touching Daniel&#39;s thigh for quite some time, Daniel kept his mind with the group and what else could he do with his new found abilities.<br />
<br />
Cameron, despite proclaiming he&#39;s the best drinking among them - proved by the amount of cans you&#39;ll see around him - he&#39;s actually very easy to get drunk. Jenny was just laughing at Cameron&#39;s situation, while Noah is still trying to get Daniel&#39;s attention, still keeping up with the fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what- I&#39;ll just go and pee my dizziness off&quot; Cameron had a hard time standing up and Jenny had a much louder laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;My god. Daniel, can you help your bestfriend out. Make sure he would be drowning in toilet water, like before.&quot; Jenny tried to keep herself from laughing out loud.<br />
<br />
Daniel then stood up and had put an arm on Cameron&#39;s waist and guided him to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! You don&#39;t have to help me. I can do this on my-&quot; Cameron stopped as he almost accidentally fall onto the floor. Luckily, Daniel was there to pull him to his balance. &quot;No you can&#39;t. Can&#39;t risk you going in the wrong room and peeing on my dad&#39;s bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.&quot; Cameron complies.<br />
<br />
Daniel lead Cam to the bathroom. Although Cam told Daniel to not go in the bathroom with him, Daniel still insists, holding Cam to his place. Cam struggled pulling his jeans down so Daniel helped him but he didn&#39;t realize that he was also actually helping Cam to pull his dick out. Their eyes met as Cam went straight to peeing. They both looked away, blushing at each other. It didn&#39;t last though when they realized Cam was missing the toilet. In response, Daniel held onto Cam&#39;s dick and pointed it at the toilet, noticing that Cameron was actually hard. Cameron blushed once more. He was done peeing but Daniel still had his hand on Cam&#39;s hardon.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait... I&#39;m sorry-&quot; Cam was cut off with his own moan as Daniel squeezed out the remaining pee off Cam, which continued to him stroking Cam&#39;s cock. &quot;D-Daniel-&quot;.<br />
<br />
Daniel didn&#39;t stop. He kept his eye on Cam&#39;s hardening cock. Cam moved his body and leaned on the bathroom wall as Daniel kept on stroking him. Although it may seem like Daniel is lusting for Cam, it was actually more of Daniel wanting to try the bracelet out on Cameron. Remembering what was written on the yellow note before, what was told by the end of that note, he want to try merging his body with Cameron.<br />
<br />
Soon, Daniel was leaning onto Cam. Their lips on each others&#39;. Cam didn&#39;t protest. He was too drunk to fight back but at the same time, he was actually liking this feeling of Daniel kissing him, this feeling of Daniel&#39;s body against his, this feeling of another man stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
Daniel started the merge right away. Cam didn&#39;t notice that their feet had already been merged, their shoes mixing to make a new model of that brand. Their legs combined, bulking up a little to add muscle to Daniel. Daniel moved his hand up to Cam&#39;s chest and their hips merged. The first noticeable change was on their clothes. Daniel was wearing cotton shorts while Cam was wearing a denim jeans which evened out to a knee leveled denim shorts. Their new cock was left out of their shorts. It was still rock hard but it was far much different than what Cameron and Daniel&#39;s cock supposed to look like. It was about 9 inch hard, thicker than Daniel&#39;s. Their balls are much bigger.<br />
<br />
So far, they look like two men who are conjoined with one torso facing the other, like Daniel lost his lower body and is clinging onto Cameron while riding on his torso. Speaking of torso, their barrels started to combine. Under their new shirt was forming much defined muscles. Their pecs had swollen larger. 6 pack abs that couldn&#39;t compare to Cam&#39;s formed on their stomach. Their arms met each other, they held onto each other&#39;s hands and soon merged into one pair. Their biceps formed rounder. Their hands looked bigger and calloused. One hand moved to their new cock that has been begging for attention throughout the whole merging.<br />
<br />
Daniel and Cam was having a hard time kissing now. Their face pushed into each other. Their heads combined to form one new image.<br />
<br />
The new man&#39;s hair was a middle ground between Daniel&#39;s buzz cut and Cam&#39;s medium length. It shaped into a short fauxhawk cut. It kept the two men&#39;s black hair. A short peach fuzz grew above the new man&#39;s thin lips and on his well defined jaw. His eyes opened, showing the dark shade of gray. He finally opened his mouth to moan with his new baritone voice.<br />
<br />
Finally, Daniel and Cameron became one man. Daniel was left in control but he knows he&#39;s not just Daniel nor Cameron anymore. Their memories merged into one. Still being an athletic, gay, cocky, but shy kind of guy, Damien was brought to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Shit! I&#39;m gonna-&quot;<br />
<br />
Damien stroked his new cock much faster and soon came on the floor, blowing out what was left of Daniel and Cameron, a huge load which was a combination of the former men&#39;s semen. It was super intense, he could almost fill up one glass. It took Damien a few seconds to finally bring him back to his senses and put his cock back in his shorts. He went to the mirror and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess bestfriends really be sticking together from now on.&quot; He chuckled and went back to the living room.</p>
