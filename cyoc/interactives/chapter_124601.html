<br />
Jeremy was a little nervous about meeting with Dr. Adam Jones, especially when he learned that he was only 20 years old with a doctorate and two PhDs. He had difficulty opening up to anyone, much less a psychologist looking to pick apart his brain and delve deep into his innermost private thoughts. But he trusted the judgement of his friend. And he really did need advice. For the first time in a long time, he was not sure what to do.  It had never been hard for him to do the right thing. But he wasn&#39;t sure what the right thing to do was in this case.  It might help to get some guidance from a professional.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt strangely at ease with Dr. Jones, despite his initial apprehension. He soon found himself telling him everything, from the death of his parents due to a genetic disease, his disastrous attempt to cure Polly, his dirty dealings with Heather, right up to Polly&#39;s latest visit with him in the lab.  He even discussed his conflicting feelings about converting to a polar bear. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear to me,&quot; said Dr. Jones, making some notes in his IPad, &quot;that the reason for your focus on your sister is because you&#39;re only seeing the things you did wrong with it. You should never feel badly about making mistakes, because people often learn more by doing wrong for the right reasons than they do by being right for the wrong reasons. Also, innovation is never a straightforward linear process. We didn&#39;t start with sticks and stones and come all the way through to this current age without people making endless mistakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that, &quot; said Jeremy. &quot;But this isn&#39;t academic, some theoretical idea I was tossing around.  This was real life.  My mistake hurt real people.  I ruined my sister&#39;s life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, &quot; said Dr. Jones, making a few notes in his IPad. &quot;Let&#39;s talk about that.  You say you &#39;ruined&#39; your sister&#39;s life.  Those are your words, not mine.  Do you care to elaborate on that?  Why you chose those words exactly and how you feel you &#39;ruined&#39; her life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, isn&#39;t it obvious.  I cursed her to be a freak, an Animalian, &quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; said Dr. Jones, jotting down some more notes.  &quot;Another fascinating choice of words.  You describe the Animalians as &#39;freaks&#39;.  Why would you use those words?  Do you despise the Animalians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not,&quot; said Jeremy. &quot;I mean, they are good people, I guess.  At least the ones I have met.  But you have to admit they are deformed. They are hybrids of people and animals, for God&#39;s sake.  I don&#39;t hate people with disabilities, but I wouldn&#39;t call them normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; said Dr. Jones.  &quot;You consider being an Animalian a disability.  And you feel guilt about what you consider &#39;disabling&#39; your sister. Is that why you considered uplifting yourself to a polar bear? As a punishment?  A way to atone for your sins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, not really.  Admittedly, I don&#39;t want to be a polar bear.  But I don&#39;t think of conversion as a punishment.  I just want to help her.  So Polly won&#39;t have to bear her burden alone.  Like Marcy said, it might help her cope with her disability....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes.  The other polar bear girl you mentioned that visited with your sister.  So, it seems like she is not alone. That she already has someone to share her burden,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I guess,&quot; said Jeremy glumly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said she spoke very favorably about her family.  Isn&#39;t that why you chose to leave her in their care?&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; said Jeremy again.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones stared closely at Jeremy, causing him to avert his eyes and look the ground.  Dr. Jones made a few more notes in his IPad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Green, if you aren&#39;t going to be honest with me, I feel we are both wasting our time.  I can&#39;t help but feel you might be holding something back.  Was there another reason you were avoiding your sister?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
Jeremy sighed loudly.  He decided he might as well let it all out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, I still feel ashamed, &quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashamed of your sister?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, God no.  Ashamed of myself.  For what I did to her.  I love my sister, I love spending time with her. But every time I see her I can&#39;t help but be reminded of my mistake, of how I hurt her.  So I delved back into my work.  The harder I work, the more time I spend in the lab, the quicker I can finally finish my project and cure her.  Then she will be back to normal, and we can have a normal life again,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so we come full circle.  Again, you feel that Polly is not &#39;normal&#39; and needs to be cured.  Why?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, Doctor.  She is a giant mutant polar bear.  Do I really need to spell it out for you?&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I would like some clarification.  I treat a wide variety of patients, human and Animalian, with markedly different features. I fail to see how her appearance makes her &#39;abnormal&#39; or in need of some cure,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what kind of life can she have like that? What kind of life can any of them have?  I don&#39;t hate the Animalians - I pity them,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, some of my patients have expressed some depression as a result of their conversion.  But the vast majority of them - especially the ones who voluntarily converted - would find your pity very condescending.  Although they have only begun their new lives - in fact, this situation is still very new to all of us - several of them are already leading very fulfilling lives, with promising careers and bright futures, &quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bright futures? As what?  Zoo exhibits? Sideshow freaks?&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones gave Jeremy a stern look.  &quot;I know this is an open environment where I encourage you to freely speak your mind, but I would appreciate it if you would refrain from using that kind of language to describe Animalians.  I find it to be a bit unkind and a little crass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Doctor,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright.  As I said, I want you to be open and honest.  I don&#39;t judge you or any of my patients, &quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;But, more to the point, there are a large number of careers available.  True, there are some that participate in different shows. But they do so voluntarily and with great pride, no different than any actor, athlete or performer. But the majority are working towards careers in other fields, such as farming, construction, and manufacturing.  The abilities granted to them by their converted forms are seen as a gift in these  fields. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Manual labor? That is what Polly has to look forward to?&quot; asked Jeremy snidely. &quot;I wanted something better for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things, if she so chooses.  But there are Animalians in other fields. There are scientists, zoologists, archeologists, explorers just to name a few. There may be some careers that she will not be able to pursue based on her physical features, but that is true even in human society.  How many short professional basketball or volleyball players have you met? Pilots are required to have perfect vision.  Although, with advances in technology, some pilots have been able to overcome this physical limitation.  Perhaps, with time, we will see future innovations help Animalians overcome similar limitations, &quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot; But, let me ask you a question - have you ever asked Polly what she wants?  What career does she have in mind? Or what she thinks about her condition?  Have you ever asked if she even wants to be &#39;cured&#39;? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, she is just a kid.  She doesn&#39;t know anything.  She doesn&#39;t know what she will be missing,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, enlighten me. I, too, am curious what you think she will be missing,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, the normal stuff.  Going to school, going to birthday parties, having a sleepover, playing kid games, maybe even organized sports. That kind of stuff, &quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she is in school now, making a good number of friends. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she was soon invited to parties or sleepovers.  And I believe they are setting up sports leagues for the Animalians.  I think the last IAC featured a number of events, although most of the competitors were teens or adults.  Didn&#39;t you see it on the Animalia Ambassadoria show?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have time to watch shows, &quot; said Jeremy gruffly.  &quot;But what about other stuff.  She will never drive a car or even travel anywhere.  And how will she ever date, much less get married or have kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she really need to drive a car?  As for travel, she is not the only Animalian. Given time and increased demand, I am sure the marker will create means for Animalians to travel comfortably.  They are still new to this world - give the world a little time to catch up and accommodate them,&quot; said Dr. Jones. He sighed loudly. &quot;As for dating - well, I must admit it will be difficult.  Her options may be more limited and she will have to look out for people trying to take advantage of her condition.  But is that not the same case for anyone who is seeking a partner?  Have you not had experienced similar problems in your own amorous pursuits of the opposite sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well, not really, &quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, &quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;Are you a homosexual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, &quot; said Jeremy brusquely. &quot;Not that there is anything wrong with that.  It&#39;s just ... well, I have always been so busy.  I never really had time for that kind of thing.  It just didn&#39;t seem that important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; said Dr. Jones, taking a note in his IPad.  &quot;Well, your mental health is just as important as your career.   A healthy person maintains a good balance between their work and an active social life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Doctor, I know,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones took several more notes in his pad.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, our time is about up.  I am afraid I must inform Horizon Labs that I cannot recommend you for conversion to a polar bear, not yet at least, &quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
Although he was a bit disappointed, Jeremy also felt a little relieved.  It looked like the decision had been taken out of his hands. Jeremy didn&#39;t need to feel guilty, but in a small way he still did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to continue our sessions.  And perhaps with time, I may alter my recommendation if you truly do want to convert for the right reasons.  In the meantime, I would like you to attend a little group counseling with some of my other patients. The members of this group are seeking &#39;bond-mates&#39; or &#39;life-partners&#39;, &quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about that, Doctor.  I don&#39;t think I would fit in with that group,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of the members are Animalians.  Some are human, like yourself, who are lonely and need help learning to socialize.  Some are just a little confused about who or what they want. At the very least it would be helpful to your co-worker, Heather. I am sure she would appreciate seeing a friendly face in a crowd of strangers,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  Heather is seeking a mate?&quot; said Jeremy with a little shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.  Or maybe - like you - she is just a little lonely.  In any case, it would do you good to get out and socialize. A structured environment like this might be just the place to start.  Who knows - you might even learn a few things about  <br />
 Animalians.  So what do you say? Will you do it?  If not for yourself, then the sake of  your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Doctor.  I&#39;ll see you there, &quot; said Jeremy, standing up and shaking his hand.  &quot;Thank you, you have given me a lot to think about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones just nodded sagely.  &quot;Anytime, my pleasure. It is what I am here for.  I look forward to seeing you at the next group session.  In the meantime, why don&#39;t you take a little break and visit your sister?  Your work can wait and I think it would be a good start to beginning your social therapy.  And I know your sister would be happy to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy thanked him, promising to do just that, and left Dr. Jones&#39; office.  <br />
<br />
Now alone, Dr. Jones could finish the notes for his session.  It didn&#39;t take a genius to recognize that Heather&#39;s secret crush was her co-worker, Jeremy. Determining if the love was reciprocal would take a little more time and careful analysis.  <br />
<br />
It was a tricky business, choosing bond-mates.  Conversion was irreversible, so the candidates had to be carefully screened before getting approval from Horizon Labs or the Animalian Council.  But he suspected that Jeremy had the same feelings for Heather.  Of course, he couldn&#39;t tell Jeremy about Heather&#39;s feelings.  That would break the sacred covenant of doctor-patient confidentiality.   But he had a feeling after a few group counselling sessions it would be evident even to a socially-inept introvert like Jeremy.<br />
 <br />
Whatever the case, it would make his next group session very interesting.  But for now, he had more patients that needed help.  Dr. Jones buzzed his secretary, letting her know he was ready for his next patient.</p>
