<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle lay on his bed, the massive breasts that were once his mother&#39;s rising and falling with his breathing, their weight making them ever apparent. His current form was, by all appearances, mostly normal, a tall and voluptuous body, not to fat, but still plus sized, wide hips with thick thighs and an ass to match, large breasts that, while still big, looked perfect for the body they were attached to. Everything was an even and healthy tan, the previous owner of the body had made sure never to miss a tanning bed appointment. All of this was topped by the smaller and out of place pale head of a young teenager, his scraggly short hair, and soft but masculine features stood out like a sore thumb, not that anyone would notice this.<br />
<br />
Kyle, the current owner of his body, lay there, trying not to confirm it&#39;s existence, all the while trying to riffle through ideas as to how to fix his current problem. He could use the curse on his mom and just swap heads back, but then he&#39;d have to figure out how to word the curse so that it would seem normal. He could just live with this, it was a body he glanced at from time to time, even though it was the body that birthed him. Finally he could call a friend, attempting to convince them of what happened and have them make the changes for him, if he did that he could just have a male body again, and not screw up his mom more, then he could just curse her and make her female again. <br />
<br />
“Yeah...” Kyle winced at his mother&#39;s voice coming from his mouth. “That&#39;s what I need to do. I&#39;ll call Jarred.” Kyle&#39;s friend Jarred was his smartest friend, and he thought would be the one person he could convince that he&#39;d been cursed. Kyle got up, walking to the living room, feeling his body jiggle with every step and thinking that this would be over soon, he grabbed his cellphone off the living room table where he had left it, and called Jarred, who would be at lunch by now.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kyle. Where are you man? You sick?” Jarred answered the phone.<br />
<br />
“Yeah about that.” Kyle proceeded to explain to Jarred that he had been cursed, and the conditions of the curse, being very specific about every detail. “So I was thinking you could help.” <br />
<br />
“So.... let me get this straight, Jennifer Smith, the preppy bitch, cursed you to swap heads with your mom, because you dared her to bark?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, weird right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I&#39;m calling bullshit.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You really expect me to believe the town curse is real? And that you now have your mom&#39;s body? Dude, I know your mom is hot, but this is really pervy, even for us! You&#39;ve got to be sick right now.”<br />
<br />
“Listen man, it&#39;s real, I&#39;m sitting here, with her body right now.” <br />
<br />
“Okay, send me a pic of your boobs then.” Kyle sighed and took a picture of his chest, sending it to Jarred. <br />
<br />
“See? You look completely normal. You are really out of it man. Go back to bed.” <br />
<br />
“Jarred! Please, I&#39;m not lying! You can&#39;t see it because of the curse!” <br />
<br />
“Fine! Fine! Curse me then.”<br />
<br />
“Transform or dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dare.”<br />
<br />
“I dare you to use the curse to fix this problem.”<br />
<br />
“Okay man, fine. Transform or Dare.”<br />
<br />
“Transform.” <br />
<br />
“Good. So you&#39;ve wasted my whole lunch break with this bullshit. For your transformation, since you really think you&#39;ve swapped with your mom, your mother&#39;s body, her real body will return to it&#39;s rightful owner according to the curse. And since she&#39;s already hot, her breasts will grow two cup sizes and be perfectly perky, even without a bra, and she&#39;ll gain a foot in height!”<br />
<br />
“DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, she deserves to be a big tall amazon! As for the rest of your “curse”, it&#39;ll remain the same, which I don&#39;t see a problem there. And there&#39;s one last thing. From this point forward, you won&#39;t use the curse to try and change who the owner of that body is after this is done. I hope that helps, cause it won&#39;t help me not be hungry.” <br />
<br />
Jarred hung up the phone and Kyle sat there, anxiously waiting for the changes to begin. Unfortunately for Kyle, the curse had done the complicated math of who owned what, and according to Jen&#39;s curse, even the curse itself believed that he was the rightful owner of his mother&#39;s body now, so the curse went on to do it&#39;s work. Kyle felt things begin to change, but not how he wanted. <br />
<br />
“NO! THIS ISN&#39;T MY BODY! IT&#39;S MOM&#39;S!” He screamed as he felt himself growing taller and larger all around, he watched, tears in his eyes as his already larger body grew in all directions finally stopping at a staggering seven feet tall. He shivered as he felt his breasts firm up expanding up to an M cup, making themselves much, much more apparent to him, lifting themselves into his view to their now permanent position, looking as if they were held up by a bra. Kyle sobbed, this wasn&#39;t supposed to be like this, this wasn&#39;t his body, he sat there, crying for a while knowing he should have just waited to swap with his mom again, and finally calmed down. Kyle stood up, the new height of an already taller body than he had this morning causing some vertigo, he wiped his eyes, noticing that the growth had been even with everything below his neck, and wobbly walked back to his room, the gargantuan breasts that were ever present in his view now bounced with every subtle movement. <br />
<br />
Kyle sighed in defeat and plopped down on the bed, staring down at himself. “Shit.” He reached up and messaged one of his breasts. “I really fucked up now. Maybe I could at least help mom get back to normal.” He muttered, not thinking about what his hands were doing he continued to message his breasts for a while, the sensations turning him on a little, but he was too distracted, not feeling the urge to masturbate with his mom&#39;s pussy just yet. It would be a while until he got used to his now permanent body, but at least he had the weekend. It would be a long one, but maybe he could at least figure out how to use the curse to at least be seen with this body now.</p>
