<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After clicking and typing, dragging and dropping, adjusting personalities, bodies, histories, clothing, and everything he could think of, Chuck sat back.  What had felt like mere minutes had gone for nearly two hours and Chuck had enjoyed every minute of it.  <br />
<br />
Years ago, after their first or second meeting, Michael Wilson had called him a pervert.  Back then, Chuck had gotten mad.  What had been wrong with enjoying a little eye candy!? And Michael and his boys were certainly that.  All the Wilson men were good looking, at least in Chuck&#39;s estimation.  Michael, a stern silver fox, had kept a tight leash on the boys.  He cut a muscular frame and spoke with a booming voice as he demanded that the boys do their chores.  Jacob had been a studly jock, going from practice to practice and jogging most days.  Chuck had liked to catch glimpses of him working out or running around, imagining the stud cooling down in the locker room or doing his stretches.  Mark the middle son was the one who had spent the most time in the pool, doing laps in his long trunks and occasionally having friends over.  Chuck couldn&#39;t help it that one of  his windows had overlooked their fence and let him see the slimmer boy out there getting tan. He could have maybe trained some of the &quot;security cameras&quot; he&#39;d attached to the eaves of his house away from the pool and the back yard but he had liked having a full perimeter around the house.  Tim was a bit more boyish than the other two.  Chuck had watched for him too as he grew lanky and tall as he got older, still keeping his slight frame.   <br />
<br />
Chuck didn&#39;t like that Michael had called him a pervert but as he had become more and more obsessed with the Wilson men, he realized it was true.   He was lonely and all he could do was watch.  All he could do was catch glimpses of the sexy bodies next door.  He had jerked it to thoughts of the guys next door for years. He had taken items from their trash, little things here and there discarded shoes, worn out clothes, mementos of the objects of his lust.  When it had gotten to be too little just to watch, he had called the house, hoping that Michael or the boys would pick up, eventually getting off on their frustrated curses as he got them riled up.  <br />
<br />
His world had come crashing down when Michael had put that damn for sale sign in the yard, his fantasy was leaving. It wasn&#39;t until weeks later, while surfing the web after one of his jerkoff sessions that he stumbled across the Chronivac.   It seemed too good to be true, a program that could alter reality itself. A week ago, he paid the money and waited for the CD-rom to come in the mail.  That same week, the sold sign had gone up and it had been a race against time and the US Postal Service to get what he needed to make his dreams come true.  In the last minute, he had gotten it and averted the crisis.   Now he had the Wilsons, his dream family, right where he wanted them and he could see them as he envisioned them, as he wanted them. He could make them into the dream he had always wanted them to be and pretty soon, they&#39;d be begging him to be a part of their happy home.    <br />
<br />
Jacob must have completely zoned out.  Looking around, he realized he was in his bedroom. For some reason, it briefly crossed his mind that the room had been empty mere hours ago. But his thoughts quickly left him as he felt a wave of horniness rush over his body. Looking down, he noticed his big dick sticking up out of his jockstrap, just aching for attention.  Jacob reached down and began to pump the throbbing member moaning deeply as he began to stroke.  For some reason, he felt bigger, stronger than he had before but he couldn&#39;t think why.  He began to stroke his meat feeling his horniness crescendo but not reaching a full climax.  Getting up from his bed, he strode over to the mirror to watch himself pump.  Yanking down the jock, he let his big balls hang free as he began to hump his hand as he took in his 6&#39;9&quot; frame in all its glory.  He pulled the yellowed garment to his face and huffed the musky scent of his package.  In his previous life, he had never thought to do something so degrading but at the moment, it just felt right, like he&#39;s done it a hundred times, and just like that, he remembered he had done it hundreds of times. It was his favorite way to get off, watching his muscles flex as he stroked. He was a fuckin beast and he loved to see his muscles bulge and his veins pulse. Jake felt his whole body tense as he unloaded on the mirror with a guttural &quot;Fuck yeah.&quot; He painted his reflection with her after jet of cum. Panting as his boner subsided and paying no mind as he dribbled cum on the floor.  Taking the jock, he smeared the majority  of it off so he could see  himself again.  He hopped on one foot sliding the underwear back on.  Jake continued to get dressed donning a pair of cutoffs, a mesh shirt, a pair of tube socks and work boots.  It was time to mow the yard. <br />
<br />
Chuck had enjoyed the pixelated show but now he was going to see his handiwork in the flesh.  He pushed away from his desk, knocking over a stack of porno mags as he stood up, readjusting his own modest but leaking boner as he rushed down to the front porch to watch the show in the flesh.</p>
