<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">April, who's mind was mostly on the various colleges she had applied to, had also felt the odd sensation of cramps in her privates and lower abdomen and the strange tingling sensation in her upper legs, near her groin, that felt like that specific area had fallen asleep. But being used to such sensations, except for the pins and needles, she mentally waved it off to the fact that she was getting her period and paid not the slightest bit attention to anything that was happening, except to head for the restroom and the others had left and buy a pad, the dispenser was out of tampons.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the stall, she placed the pad in the centre of her underwear and was thinking about getting a Midol or when she got home as she pulled up her underwear and pants, but stopped when she happened to look down at her genitals and think that something was off and that for some reason the dark pubic hair looked like it had grown and taken on a lighter shade.<br />
<br />
Mentally shrugging, she told herself, &quot;What do I care. I'll just shave and be done with,&quot; and pulling up her pants and underwear, she adjusted herself, thinking that for some reason nothing down there felt right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost fuller, tighter,&quot; April thought to herself as she exited the stall, shifted her pants about and headed for the mirror and sink to wash her hands and make sure she looked her best, thinking that it must be the pad as she was so used to wearing tampons for her monthlies.<br />
<br />
Outside the bathroom, April decided that she wanted to first browse a couple stores before heading home and heading toward the nearest of the shops she wanted check out, she paid not the slightest inkling to the odd sensation in her nether-regions until just outside the store, she passed by another girl and without giving it a second thought, she looked at the girl's butt and thought, &quot;Yeah. I'd definitely tap that. Damn...&quot; while inside her jeans, she felt a tightening sensation growing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising what she was thinking, April blushed and turned away from the other young woman before she could be caught staring and hastily went into the store, wondering why it was that she had thought something so profoundly masculine.<br />
<br />
But the thoughts did not stop there as she almost started to flirt with the cashier and on the way out, she started to check out another woman coming into the store, the tightening sensation in her pants growing each time that she started to look at another young woman and think sexually about them. Disturbed, April decided to skip the rest of the shops and head for home, forgetting that she was supposed to meet Bets in the food-court at seven.<br />
<br />
Home, she let herself in and taking the dark house, she figured that her brother must be at a friend’s house and their father was once again working late. Thinking this was a blessing, April headed for the kitchen to grab a snack and afterward, she headed to her room and booting up her computer, she began to check to see if she had any new mail and any replies to her online college applications.<br />
<br />
When it became apparent that she had no new messages and that the colleges still had not sent her any replies, she started to browse and after a moment, she wandered onto a 'adult-only' site, browsing the many pictures posted, finding herself liking more and more the pictures of the naked women as the tightening sensation continued to grow. After about fifteen minutes, April began to slide her hand down her pants, stopped and instead did the front and pushed them down a bit, feeling herself getting more and more amorous with each passing moment.<br />
<br />
And as April placed her hand down the front of her underwear, she suddenly stopped what she was doing the moment her hand passed between the pad and her genitals, noting that they felt off for some reason and for the life of her, she could not understand why she was apparently about to masturbate a bunch of pictures of naked woman and standing, her pants sliding down her legs, she extracted her hand and turned away from the computer.<br />
<br />
Hastily stepping away from her pants, leaving them lying on the floor next to the computer, she realised that she felt cramped wearing the clothes she was wearing and stripping off her shirt, she tossed it onto her pants and undoing her bra, she kicked up her socks. Approaching the full-body mirror she kept in her room, she ran a hand down her body, stopping just at the hemline of her underwear, thinking that there was no doubt that something was wrong. After a moment, she removed her panties as well, thinking it odd that she could even consider the fact that she could have a monthly.<br />
<br />
Peering into the mirror, naked, she ran a hand through the pubic hair covering her groin, thinking that it was softer and also looked lighter, almost a soft shade of red. Lying down on the bean-bag chair she had nearby, she faced the mirror and examined her genitals, thinking that her vulva did indeed look off. And as she became aware of the cramping sensation in her groin and lower abdomen, it suddenly came to her that what looked off was that she had no vagina opening and that her urethra and clitoris appeared to be fusing together and the clitoris hood was morphing into something she had no words to describe.<br />
<br />
As she sat up, the oddity of her urethra and clitoris pressing into the bean-bag chair, April asked herself, &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; and standing, she began to pace back and forth, stopping long enough to make sure the door to her room was locked.<br />
<br />
When she still could not come up with a solution, April returned to the computer, sat down, found it uncomfortable to do so, shifted about until she was sitting slightly reclined and her legs spread, she began to once again browse the internet, this time searching for any clue as to how a woman's exterior genitals could suddenly begin to morph into something that that looked suspiciously like the male penis.<br />
<br />
But she did not get far in her search and instead drifted, this time to a couple wildlife and veterinary sites, bringing up pictures of foxes, each image showing a different vixen's genitals, all clearly in heat. And as April continued to browse, the amorous feeling returned and shifting a bit, she placed her hand to her genitals and began to play, with herself, stopping only once to get a squirt of lotion from the bottle she kept handy when her hands, knees or feet became dry.<br />
<br />
As April browsed more and more of the pictures, each showing a different vixen in heat or mating, she began to pant heavily and rub herself more as the cramping sensation in her groin grew until it became a pressure that started to push out on the patch of skin now covering her vagina opening. Ten minutes after she had started, April let out a moan of pleasure and as there was a soft popping noise and the skin covering her vagina opening inflated outward, complete with two evenly-sized bulges, her clitoris and urethra fully merged into a penis and the clitoris hood completed its morph into a penis sheath as April stared, horrified, as a liquid erupted out of the tip of her newly formed penis and spilled all over her hand.<br />
<br />
Suddenly aware what was happening, April jumped up and as her newly-formed penis retracted into its sheath, she ran toward the mirror, muttering, &quot;No, no, no,&quot; over and over and peering into the reflective object, taking in what she was seeing, she suddenly wanted nothing more than to scream.<br />
<br />
As she ran a hand over her new genitals, horrified that she had a penis, penis sheath and testicles, wondering why they appeared more animal then human, she turned about and dashed across her room, and pausing for a moment, April realised that the way she was standing was the same way her brother and father stood. Hastily undoing the lock, uttering out hysterical-like laughter that sounded more like a fox’s bark, she wrenched opened the door and dashed out the door. Moving down the hall toward the bathroom, she rushed inside and slamming the door and locking it after a bit, she began to pace, still uttering the weird barking noised every now and again.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she decided that a shower would clear her mind and hysterics taking completely over, she turned on the shower and stepped in, where she would spend the next hour trying to wash away her neo-genitals, barking a weird foxlike sound that she didn’t give a second thought to because she thoughts she was still laughing in hysterics.</p>
