<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The departure of Ponius from the torture chamber did nothing to ease Matt’s situation, in fact it made things worse. His endurance far surpassed that of the others who were unconscious, so all of the hinny demons had focused their attention on him. He was being plowed in the ass while his massive curved erection was being stroked, the golden cord keeping him from cuming. Yet another demon was cupping his churning balls, fondling them.<br />
<br />
Pain, pleasure, and lust warred inside Matt. He no longer heard the demons yelling in his ears demanding he talk. He was a creature of sexual stimulation, so much so that he embraced the pleasure and the lust. He thrust back into the demon fucking his ass doing his best to milk the huge cock. He growled lustily as his cock was stroked to steel hardness and beyond. He actually started yelling at those torturing him to stroke harder. The pain was there, but his sex fogged brain turned it to pleasure. He was the ultimate stud stallion, and these looser demons were jealous and worshiping his superior body. They could never measure up!<br />
<br />
Matt swung in his chains as he thrust his massive erection into the face of the demon molesting it, demanding he suck it. The demon fucking his ass came massively inside Matt which finally pushed him over the edge. He let forth a massive screaming whinny as he passed out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The world became a swirling gray fog. Matt was free, in fact he was prancing he was so full of joy and lust. His massive erection pounded his chest with every step as cum dripped from his ass coating his legs. He could sense others nearby. His rational brain told him he was hallucinating, that this was likely a delusion. Matt didn’t care. He let forth a screaming whinny, a combination of lust and fear.<br />
<br />
“Colt! Follow my voice! Your friend Kyle is here! Come quickly!”<br />
<br />
Kyle!? The mere thought that he would be here definitely meant this was a delusion. Matt pranced in the direction of the strange voice anyways. <br />
<br />
“Maaatttt!”, Kyle whinnied.  His brain was still in an equine fog from his mental merging with the stallion Horse. He bolted towards his half changed friend and head-butted him, knocking him off his hooves.<br />
<br />
“OOoof”, was all Matt could say as he was knocked off his hooves by the massive clydesdale  demon.  Barely was he on the ground before the creature yanked him up into a massive hug. He then turned him loose and stepped back.<br />
<br />
“You stud”, Kyle neighed. Nearby Horse stood watching, he couldn’t help but laugh and shake his equine head.<br />
<br />
Finally Matt got a look at the clydesdale’s face. “Kyle?!? That is you!” Matt stammered as he beheld his best friend. “You’re…..Awesome!”<br />
Kyle grinned back at his friend and posed flexing his huge equine muscles. Matt ran his hands over his friend’s muscular chest and shoulders. Kyle in turn inspected his friend’s new equine mane, cock, legs, and tail. <br />
<br />
Horse decided he needed to break things up before nature took it’s course. “Colt, you can call me Horse. How did you get that golden cord on your cock?”<br />
<br />
“Horse is friend”, Kyle pawed the ground and gave an exaggerated head nod to encourage his friend.<br />
<br />
Matt looked at Kyle strangely, then proceeded to explain to Kyle and Horse about his capture and torture with the rest of the boys. <br />
<br />
Horse stomped his hoof in anger. “Those cords are meant as a demonic aid to meditation, to help access this plane of ultimate lust. Torture was never one of their purposes, although the use is novel.”<br />
<br />
Horse stood there looking at the colts. By merging with Kyle he felt like he knew this colt Matt. Besides, Master Equus had indicated that the rescue of Kyle’s friends was a priority if it was possible. Now here stood Matt in the plain of lust. This should not be possible for a colt who was not even a full demon with no training or assistance. This Matt is exceptional in focus, as such he would make a powerful warrior demon. Doubtless Ponius would turn him into a brute beast and sell him off.<br />
<br />
Equus had been given certain spells by Gorgi, spells he had never had occasion to use. Spells that were risky and required power and focus. Since Equus knew them, Horse did as well. Normally Horse would never dream of casting such magic, and he would not today. But Gorgi did make the comment that the most powerful warrior demons were self-created. Still, he would be giving the colt a loaded weapon. <br />
<br />
“Matt, I need you to listen to me.” Horse clomped over to Matt, a look of serious concern on his muzzle. “You need to understand some things. First, this is not a hallucination. It is what you humans would call an out of body experience. Your spirit is here with mine and Kyle’s. Can you accept that?”<br />
<br />
“I have to. Hallucinations don’t cause physical pain or pleasure, I’ve felt both here.” Matt’s attention was now focused totally on the brown stallion demon.<br />
<br />
“Good answer. You understand that you are changing into a demon. Currently you are stuck half way by the magic Ponius has put in place?” The stallion looked deeply into Matt’s eyes. He seemed to be examining his soul.<br />
<br />
“Yes, all of us know we are changing. It rocks. We want to change to complete. Hell, I love being like this when I’m not chained to a wall in a dungeon. Kyle is awesome. If we are to become like him then let it complete now as far as I’m concerned.” Matt’s tail was swishing evenly and his body language said he spoke his heart.<br />
Horse nodded, his mind now made up. “Let me give you the full truth colt. You are in a bad way. Your only option is to break the magic the binds you and your friends. You must do this yourself. I can show you how and give you some weapons, but you must act, and you must embrace the consequences. Make no mistake, you and your friends will be permanently changed into equine warrior demons. You will be strong and powerful, but will crave blood and combat ever after. Likely some of you will fall. It is possible that none of you will survive. If Ponius catches you, your fate may be worse than death. Are you prepared to take that responsibility on yourself?”<br />
<br />
Matt looked into the stallions eyes. “What are my options? All of us become slaves or beasts as things currently stand. I don’t see an action other than to act and embrace the consequences.”<br />
<br />
Horse smiled and clapped Matt on the shoulder. “You are a strong and wise colt. I will help you. Kyle, merge with your friend, give him your knowledge as I have given you mine. You know what to do and how.”<br />
<br />
Indeed Kyle did and needed no further encouragement. Without warning he embraced Matt and kissed him deeply, his hooved fingers played with Matt’s cock as they merged, memories swapping.<br />
<br />
Horse moved behind the couple stroking his large cock. He began shooting cum over Matt’s back, reaching deeply into the merged mind, yet taking directly to Matt’s core.<br />
“When you are done I will remove the cord from your cock, this will weaken it greatly in the physical world. You can move in your bonds. Smash your cock against your neighbor’s cock. It will weaken and break the cord. Then cast the spell I give you, and hose your friends down with your cum. All of you will change, but you will be the leader. Then break your bonds and fight your way from confinement. Get to an outside open area and open a gate to our ranch. Here is the spell you must use to complete your change.”<br />
<br />
The spell implanted into Matt’s mind. Despite it’s strangeness it seemed to be engraved in granite inside his memory. <br />
<br />
Images and memories flowed back and forth between Kyle and Matt. Emphasis was given to what Kyle got from Horse. When they broke contact Matt found himself nodding and head-butting Kyle. Kyle gave a neighing laugh.<br />
<br />
“Alright colt, time for you to wake up and begin your fight.” Horse reached out and grabbed the golden cord on Matt’s massive cock. It untied. Instantly Matt neighed and faded to nothing. “Time for you to return also Kyle. We need to be ready to help Matt and your other friends if they break out.”<br />
<br />
As Hose pulled Kyle’s cord there was but one word in Kyle’s thoughts. “When”</p>
