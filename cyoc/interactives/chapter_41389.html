<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>The days following went without incident.

<p>You had found some suitable clothing in Uncle Jack's box of 
materials, apparently a prototype design he had dropped before getting 
round to trying on an enchantment, or even finishing. So you spent your 
time flying around in a simple but cute green dress and some underwear 
that had been left around from some dolls (you assume they had 
originally been intended to be models for some of the outfits). 
However, even though you were clothed you were still not allowed to go 
outside. This was understandable seeing as how fairies were not really 
a commonplace sighting nowadays.

<p>As for progress with a solution, you had not had any news. This was disheartening to say the least but you assumed that your uncle was 
getting closer to the problem.

<p>To pass the time you found that there was a simple living area in 
one of the back rooms; TV, computer, lights, somewhere to sit, the 
basics. So that is where you spent most of your time. As it turns out, 
it was not as difficult to work the computer at your size because you 
could simply hover above the keyboard and type with your feet.

<p>As far as food went it was not much of a problem. Apparently a 
fairy's diet mostly consists of fruit, so that's what you had. You 
still remember the first time you ate at this size. You had a heart 
attack when you were given a huge blue thing the size of your head and 
told it was a blueberry. After that though you found that it was far 
better than anything you had tasted before...and quite a bit messier as 
well as you found yourself with a face covered in dark purple juice.

<p>As for being a girl, well, you were still not used to that. the 
fairy aspects of your form had come easily, flight was almost second 
nature, but you would still wake up in a morning and not be expecting a 
cute, tiny girl you saw in the mirror.

<p>It was after a week that boredom really began to get intolerable. 
You wanted to go outside, to see people, anything but stay trapped in 
this shop, but you knew you had to. You lay down lazily on the vast expanse that was the small sofa in the living room, listening to the 
radio version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when your uncle 
came in looking tired, frustrated and guilty. It was at this point that 
the radio went over the concepts of the <i>somebody else's problem 
field</i> when his eyes brightened and he clapped his hands together in 
triumph. Before you could ask him what he was so excited about he 
dashed out the room again and went back to his workshop.

<p>After a while you decided to follow him down there for lack of anything better to do. Hovering down the stairs you found yourself in a 
smallish room filled with mannequins, many of which were clothed in 
various outfits, some familiar from the store, some you had never seen 
before, and some only half made. At a desk with a bright lamp on it, 
was Uncle Jack frantically working on something.

<p>"Uncle Jack" you say, "are you any closer?"

<p>He turned around, his face was still a bit guilty but it seemed like 
he had made some progress at least. "No I'm afraid" he said, "However a 
side project I've been working on seems to be about ready."

<p>"What side project?" you ask

<p>"Well, I couldn't bear to force you to stay in here for the whole 
holiday," said Uncle Jack, "it just wouldn't be fair on you, so I've 
been trying to find a way for you not to be seen."

<p>"You mean like an invisibility spell?" you ask

<p>"Yes" said Uncle Jack, "However I had been unable to make one that 
lasted more than a few minutes. Invisibility is a tricky business and 
not that many magic users can get it to work on themselves for long, 
never mind someone else. However that thing you were listening to gave 
me an alternative. If I can't make you invisible, then I could try 
making it so people ignore you."

<p>"And?" you ask

<p>"It worked!" he yells, "It was remarkably easy. I've got this little 
thing here which has the spell around it. If you wear this then people 
could look at you, past you or even bump into you and you would not 
register to them. People are actually very good at ignoring things, 
this spell just makes use of that and will work as long as you wear it. 
so then, do you wish to try it?"

<p>you are overjoyed at the ability to go outside again, you would 
still prefer to be turned back to normal but this was still an 
improvement. Landing on the table you see jack point towards a necklace 
on the desk. It was a simple little chain with a red stone set into it. 
How Jack had managed to work on something this small you had no idea, 
but you figured he must have his tricks of the trade. Putting it on you 
don't feel any different and notice that Uncle Jack is still looking at 
you.

<p>"Is it working?" you ask

<p>"I assume so" said Uncle Jack, "I know you're there so I can still 
see you. I suppose the only way to see is to test it."

<p>"How do we do that?" you ask

<p>"I'll need to call someone in." said Jack, "I'll get one of my 
friends who knows about my little business, that way they won't be too 
surprised to see you."</p>
