<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dinner will be ready in about 15 minutes,&quot; Maggie Lawson called from the kitchen.<br />
&quot;So, where&#39;s the bathroom, litter box, or whatever you folks use around here?&quot; asked Mike Lawson, standing up. &quot;I need to wash up.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you Grandpa,&quot; offered Spencer, as she stood up and noticed the pile of shed dog hair she had been sitting in. Since she was still in her were form until her injuries completely healed, Spencer just flicked her tail a couple of times to shake the shedding off as she led Mike down the hall.<br />
&quot;So, tell me more about this normal that&#39;s winning your heart,&quot; he requested.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s already won it. Just has yet to fully claim it,&quot; replied Spencer in a low voice, as she started recounting everything.<br />
As they took turns in the bathroom washing up for Thanksgiving dinner, one standing outside a closed door while the other tended to their business; Spencer told her grandfather almost everything (except the times Eric saw her naked and she orally enjoyed him) about Eric Anderson, from their first meeting to him dumping Julie Stovall after catching her having sex with a wereotter. From their first date to Eric attempting to come to her rescue when Jeremy Bower, Junior came to Moon Lake. &quot;Which is why I sometimes call him Slugger now,&quot; she added, almost giggling.<br />
From their impromptu dinner date in the Teachers&#39; Lounge of Moon Lake High to the fact that, &quot;He&#39;s intelligent, cute, actually a gentleman, which is something I never really encountered before. Eric likes <i>Doctor Who</i> and a lot of other stuff I do. He plays chess too, although we haven&#39;t had a chance to have a game yet, AND both mom AND dad approve of him!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds like you finally got a winner in the love lottery,&quot; said Mike, as his granddaughter came out of the bathroom.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Spencer, dreamily.<br />
&quot;But his only hang up on becoming a were is which species?&quot; asked her grandfather, lowering his voice as he did so.<br />
&quot;The way Eric&#39;s looking at it right now, he&#39;s logistically hoping to become something that&#39;s physically compatible with my hybrid form,&quot; explained Spencer, after checking to make sure they were alone in the hallway.<br />
&quot;Sounds like a real keeper if he&#39;s going to all that trouble just to be with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric certainly is,&quot; replied Spencer, as a smile crossed her muzzle.<br />
&quot;So, if I can ask, what&#39;s this kid thinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless something happens to take the decision out of his hands, Eric&#39;s leaning towards werepanther.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can see that. Sleek. Athletic. Good choice,&quot; replied Mike, which made Spencer smile even more as she led them back to the dining room.<br />
<i>Hmmm... I remember meeting a werepanthress just a couple of years ago as part of the &quot;entertainment&quot; at one of my buddy&#39;s honorable discharge retirement party. But what was her name...?</i> her grandfather tried to recall as they rejoined everyone for dinner.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;...and after I graduated Moon Lake College with honors, earning my business degree, I became employed at the Moon Lake Savings and Loan, working my way up to Head Teller, a position I have proudly held for the last five years,&quot; Kenya Adaeze told William and Martha Anderson, along with everyone else present within their home listening. &quot;If my investments continue to perform at their current levels, theoretically I could retire in ten years and never have to worry about work or money ever again, but I cannot see myself becoming one of the <i>idle</i> rich.&quot;<br />
The only thing she didn&#39;t tell them that their son and her lover (secretly also her future fiance) Nate knew was that she had an uncontrollable desire for sex that Nate was now satisfying both physically and by giving her the romantic love she lacked in her life. It was this emptiness that made Kenya sometimes seek work as the &quot;companion for hire&quot; Kendra Smythe, usually to rich weres around Moon Lake and Washington state. An alternate job and identity she swore both would end now that her wonderful werewolf was in her life.<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s impressive that you have a very steady job and own your own house,&quot; noted Nate&#39;s father William.<br />
&quot;I wish my parents were still with me, but as their only child and heir...&quot;<br />
&quot;I am a bit concerned about the age difference between you two though. 11 years, right?&quot; asked Martha.<br />
&quot;Yes. I am 27 and when I discovered your son was only 16, I will admit to being a bit shocked myself,&quot; replied Kenya. &quot;But Nathaniel, at least around me, has displayed a maturity and old worldliness mannerisms beyond his years.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wish I could see a bit of that around here sometimes,&quot; commented his mother, looking directly at Nate.<br />
&quot;In Moon Lake, a were is considered a legal adult, at least sexually, at the time of their first transformation; so you haven&#39;t broken any laws in regards to being with a minor,&quot; observed Samantha Twist, in her capacity as Town Chancellor.<br />
&quot;I tried checking the town website to find out myself, but that is good to know,&quot; said Kenya. &quot;With both of us being weres, the age difference is inconsequential, but I have already told Nathaniel that whatever course our relationship takes, his schooling is most important. Like you, I want him to graduate high school and then go on to college, if that is where his career path takes him.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have an unique accent,&quot; commented Frances Twist. &quot;You weren&#39;t originally born in Moon Lake, were you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Both of my parents were born in Africa, but when their homeland became ravaged by war, they immigrated to the United States and became citizens. I was not born until after they resettled in Moon Lake, for being naturally born weres themselves, their desire for complete sanctuary led them here. However, they never lost touch with their roots and imparted their ancestral pride to me as well as a love of our new home town and the country that gave them refuge. Depending upon what life decides, I cannot foresee myself living anywhere else but here in Moon Lake for the rest of my days,&quot; explained Kenya.<br />
&quot;Well, as long as you two take it slow and easy, and Nate keeps up his good grades, I can&#39;t see any reason for the two of them not to continue dating. Can you William?&quot; asked his wife.<br />
It was all Nate and Kenya could do to keep from smiling and hugging each other as his father said, &quot;No, but I do have one last question. You keep referring to yourself and your parents as naturally born weres, yet my werefox senses are having trouble identifying what kind of were you actually are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mine too,&quot; admitted Martha, while the Twists simply nodded in agreement.<br />
&quot;Oh. That is because of my mixed heritage,&quot; explained Kenya. &quot;While my family tree is primarily panther based, somewhere in the past, at least one of my ancestors fell in love with and married a wereleopard. When I assume my fursona, I become the panthress, but you can see a hint of leopard spots in my fur, depending upon how the light plays upon my pelt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Until now, Eric Anderson had sat in a chair by the dining room table, sipping a soda while contently listening to the conversation. He was liking this Kenya with every answer, and was glad Nate had found someone that made his big brother happy the way Spencer Lawson did him.<br />
But when Kenya revealed she was a werepanthress, Eric almost chocked on his soda, thinking that Nate&#39;s new girlfriend might be the solution to the one problem that was keeping him and the hybrid were wolf/cat from truly being together.<br />
<i>I wonder what Spencer will think of this when I tell her,</i> thought Eric, thinking of the future when he would be a were too.</p>
