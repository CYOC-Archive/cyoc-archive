<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Eric starts to pull out his clothes to get changed into, both him and Asmee hear a knock on the door. “Hey, I believe this belongs to your lioness friend in there.” Derek says before oping the door slightly and hanging a pink backpack on the doorhandle without looking. “Your mom says for all of you to take a shower before coming down. It will be fine if you take one together, your mom said that you already seen each other. Breakfast will be ready when you come down.”<br />
<br />
Derek then closes the door as Asmee walks over to grab her bag. “Was that your dad?” <br />
<br />
“Yes, I guess we need to take a shower. They must have at least heard us last night.” Eric replies. <br />
<br />
Asmee starts blushing. “I guess we could take one together, if that is fine with you?” <br />
<br />
“I would like that.” Eric replied, smiling and blushing as well. <br />
<br />
The two walks into the bathroom as Eric turns on the water. “Do you like warm or cold showers?” <br />
<br />
“Warm, please. I’m a little cold after losing most of my fur.” Asmee replies as she holds herself trying to cover her new extra breasts. <br />
<br />
Eric walks over, pulling Asmee in for a hug. “I will keep you warm.” he says to her, looking into her eyes. <br />
<br />
“If you are trying to make love to me again, I think the idea of your parents hearing us last night killed it.” <br />
<br />
“No, just trying to be nice. Besides, I think we may have another chance to show our love tonight.” Eric replies, implying about their random transformation the night before. <br />
<br />
Asmee nodded softly. “I know. I wish I knew why that happened, or why the guy threw the Lunar Ecstasy. But those are questions for after breakfast.” Asmee stomach then started to growl. “I am a little hungry.” <br />
<br />
“I would bet, you showed why Lioness are queens of all beasts.” Eric jokes. Asmee elbows him before the two of them walk into the shower. <br />
As the warm water between them, they couldn’t help to stare at each other as they bathed. Finally, Eric speaks up, though in a low tone so not to be heard by anyone outside the bathroom. “Sorry for staring, I just never seen…” <br />
<br />
“A naked girl before? I know, I haven’t seen a boy naked either.” Asmee then grabs Eric’s hand. “Here, help me. I’m a little sore from last night.” Asmee brings Eric’s hand to one of her main breasts and he cupped it gently. “Just rub a little please while I continue to lather up.” <br />
Eric does so without question. Asmee was so soft, Eric thought. In her lioness form, she was firm and full of muscles. Now, she was soft as a pillow. Eric smiles as his tiger penis starts to come out of its sheath. Eric notices it and turns away quickly. “Sorry, I know we said we wouldn’t, but you are just so soft and beautiful.”<br />
<br />
Asmee walks up from behind Eric and wraps her arms around him. “It’s fine, I was the one who asked you to rub me. It was too much for us just meeting. I’m sorry.” She lays her head in his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Eric reaches up and caresses her head. “I just hope that we get to know each other better other than just with sex.” <br />
<br />
“Me to. I don’t know what my parents will say when they get back in town, but for now, I just hope your parents like me.” Asmee says with a bit of sadness in her voice. <br />
<br />
Eric turns back around and kisses Asmee head. “I will make them love you, like I do.” <br />
<br />
Asmee smiles as she starts to rub soap over Eric, “Let me help you.” She purrs softly ash the two of them continue with their shower. <br />
<br />
Getting out of the shower, the two teens start to get dress before Asmee lets out a sigh of distress. “What is it?” Eric asks as he tries to gently zip up his shorts over his new sheath and enlarged balls. <br />
<br />
“The shirt I brought will show off my extra boobs.” Asmee replies as she turns to Eric, currently only in her skirt. “I guess I will have to borrow a shirt, at least until I can run by the house to get changed.” <br />
<br />
Eric smiles widely.  “I’ll get you one, but I be lying if I didn’t say that I like how you look now.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, you teaser.” Asmee giggles as she covers her main breast. “Just get me a shirt and don’t make me regret getting changed next to you.” <br />
<br />
Eric grabs Asmee a plain t-shirt that match the color of her skirt and then helped her with her bra. Her breast had grown some and now barely fit into the bra that was almost too big for Asmee the day before. When they were finally changed, the two of them walked downstairs to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Walking in, Eric and Asmee saw Nate and Casey sitting at far end of the table, their hands holding each other and resting on top of the table. Maggie was taking the last of the scrambled eggs and bacon off the stove and was plating for everyone. Derek was pouring himself some tea before sitting down at his usual chair. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for coming down.” Maggie says as she pulls an extra chair for Asmee. “I am Maggie, this is my husband, Darek. We take it that you are the lioness that has been spending time with our youngest son.” <br />
<br />
Nether Eric nor Asmee knew how to reply. Thankfully, Darek intervened. “Honey, Lets give them a chance to sit and eat. No need to scare the pour girl.” <br />
<br />
Maggie sat down before speaking again. “Just one thing first, did you take that drug yourself?” <br />
<br />
Asmee shakes her head and answers quietly, “No, it was thrown into my bus when we were coming back from basketball tryouts. About half of us got hit by it and transformed two nights ago. And last night, I was at home alone when I changed. I just happened to smell Eric and came here.” <br />
<br />
“Had enough sense to bring a bag?” Maggie antagonized. <br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am. Though, I still had to borrow a shirt… for reasons.” Asmee placed a hand on her stomach, and everyone could see her extra breast poking out. <br />
<br />
“Did the police investigate?” Derek asks, making Asmee eyes go wide. <br />
<br />
“Oh, no. I was supposed to check in with the officer this morning, what time is it?” Asmee asks in a panic. She stands up to run back upstairs to grab her phone from her bag. <br />
<br />
“It’s a quarter past eight!” Derek yells before facing his wife. “You don’t need to scare the girl; you were nicer to Casey.”<br />
<br />
“We know Casey, we don’t know her.” Maggie replied. <br />
<br />
“I trust her.” Eric replies definitely.<br />
<br />
Maggie was about to respond when Asmee walks back down with her phone to her ear. “Yes sir, one moment.” She then looked at Derek. “Um, sir, Officer Ramirez wants to talk to you, um, Mr. Derek.” <br />
<br />
Asmee hands over the phone as Derek walks off to the living room to talk. “The office said that the other girls affected also transformed last night again.” Asmee says to the table as she takes her seat next to Eric. “They are all okay, but they all have extra parts now or parts that didn’t change back. One has wings, one has ears and a tail. Some are like me.” Asmee grabs at her stomach again, “And one is now both a boy and a girl.” <br />
<br />
“That can happen?” Casey asks. <br />
<br />
Asmee nods. “Two of the girls one my team that change we in a relationship beforehand. Apparently, one turn into a male fox as the other turn into a rabbit. Now the rabbit girl has long ears and a tail, as the other has both male fox parts and her normal female parts.” <br />
<br />
“Wow.” Was all Maggie could reply. <br />
<br />
“Yes, and the officer says that there are still no leads on the guy that did it to us.” Asmee replied. <br />
<br />
Derek walks back in and sits down. “Well, the officer says he will be by to check in on you. He figured out what happened to the boys and want to talk to Nate. He says with Nate’s age, he should be in trouble. Though, he wanted to know who you got it from.” <br />
<br />
“Just some old dude by the school. He gives out samples like I got that night.” Nate replied. <br />
<br />
“Tell it to the officer, for now, eat.” Derek replied, cutting off his wife before she could get on to the boys again. Derek then looks over to Asmee, “Do you want something to drink?” <br />
<br />
“If that is green tea your drinking, I would like some. It’s an old habit I got from my dad.” Asmee replied. <br />
<br />
Derek nods and gets her some tea as the rest of the family continues to eat. Maggie then speaks up. “So, what school do you go to. I didn’t think any of our schools drove to their tryouts.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I go to the Sylveon academy, though, I mainly home school while my parents are out on their business trips.” Asmee replies, making almost everyone drop their forks. <br />
<br />
“Sylveon? Isn’t that the rich kid school on the other side of town?” Nate asks in shock. <br />
<br />
Asmee nods. “Yes, I am a rich kid. My parents’ house is just over the hill in the park in the Gia residence. We have a few acers out there. My parents have to travel to check on their business around the world ever so often, so I get permission to stay at the house for school. Most of the other kids do the same anyways. Sometimes, I am the only one in the class when I do go to school, but all athletics are mandatory in person, and we have to take at least one a year. I wanted to try basketball since I did archery last year.” Asmee then looked down at her tea. “I don’t mean to sound … I don’t know.” <br />
<br />
“Entitled? You don’t,” Maggie replies. “I think for me it is just a shock to hear such a school also got hit with this drug. Maybe I’ve been to hard on my boys, well, at least with Eric.” Maggie then looks at Nate. “I do need to know you understand what you did that night lead to most of this.” <br />
<br />
Nate looks down as he squeezes Casey’s hand. “I know mom.” <br />
<br />
Asmee looks up. “But if it wasn’t for his actions, I wouldn’t have met Eric.” Asmee then holds Eric’s hand close. “I do care for him, and not because of the Lunar crap.” <br />
<br />
Margret holds her hand up. “We will see. You four are all still young. It will take time for you to know if you are truly in love. For now, lets finish eating and wait for the cop.”</p>
