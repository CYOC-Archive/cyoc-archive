<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as she could, June calmed herself down. She was still enflamed with lust, and her labia had begun to throb needfully, sending warm droplets of lubrication down both of her thighs every few seconds. These drops in turn trickled down her long muscular legs, and pooled at her feet. June gulped as Ty advanced to her and took a couple of steps back, bumping into the fridge and finding her back against it. She looked down at the miniscule and completely boyish Ty, and although her mind was repulsed at the thought of fucking that, her biological urges screamed for her to rut.<br />
<br />
Luckily, June still possessed her matured willpower and sheer self-control, and she growled forcefully at Ty, reaching out flapping her wings with a loud SWOOSH as she pushed him away. He gasped and looked distinctly humiliated, and his erection began to soften. To June’s relief, the intoxicating scent of his arousal began to fade from her highly acute nostrils, and her body began to cool. Her vagina also slowly calmed, losing it’s boiling arousal. The only side effect June could notice was that she smelt very much like a horny pterosaur now, and she felt like a slut.<br />
<br />
She stared at Ty breathlessly for some time, her sharp reptilian eyes watching him with disdain. She felt something tickle her brain, like she was trying to remember something recent and couldn’t. She also noticed that her perspective was taller, and she blinked suddenly and looked down at her feet and then up at the ceiling, her beak agape in confusion. Was what that?! She had just gotten used to her new form, and it had changed yet again. She looked over herself as Ty cleared his throat in front of her, not seeing anything different, yet something had made her a little taller. She shook her head clear and looked at Ty, instincts at the back of her mind reminding her she could stab her beak through his chest with lightning fast precision if he even tried to touch her. She was a bit horrified by that thought and pushed it away.<br />
<br />
Ty stood where he was and covered his shame with his hands. “Um,” Ty said in a weak voice, “I-I’m sorry. I thought you wanted to…”<br />
“No!” June said sharply, in an extremely velvety new voice. “Not with you. Never! You’re… my son.” She sighed heavily, adding, “God, this is so fucking weird.”<br />
“A-Aren’t you wondering how it happened? Why?” Ty asked.<br />
“Er, yes.” June admitted, finally relaxing. “I mean…” She flapped her wings out to their full span and caressed herself from her neck down to her waist with the soft fleshy membranes of her new wings. “I mean, just look at me. How could I not wonder? But it felt so good. I was distracted. I…” She looked distinctly ashamed, her head lowering.<br />
Ty quickly motioned over to the living room, and the couch. “Uh, there’s no easy explanation. I thought it would work out like it did for Mark, but, well, come see!” He ran off to the living room.<br />
“M-Mark?” June asked in alarm, and quickly followed Ty, still a little wobbly on her feet.<br />
<br />
What June saw on the couch was instantly recognizable. A tiny colorful pinto horse, wrapped from the waist down in one of Mark’s ratty old white t-shirts. A horse with a definitely human body, but a horse the same. Ty didn’t have to say a word to June. She already knew. The scents coming off of the little creature were unmistakable, and June’s delightfully enhanced sense of smell told the whole story. There was the slightest hint of Mark, coupled with the smell of Ty, and the smell of a very aroused horse. That little creature was her husband!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” June gasped, and looked at the naked Ty. “Did… uh… like me!”<br />
Ty nodded at June enthusiastically as she pieced it together.<br />
The smooth-skinned blue pterosaur folded her wings across her chest, crossing her arms. “It must have been pretty good for Mark like it was for me.” She looked at Ty scornfully. “You took advantage of him while he was changing, didn’t you?”<br />
Ty blushed deeply, embarrassed.<br />
June nodded. She didn’t need to hear anything else. She didn’t want to get angry about this whole bizarre situation. Some questions still remained. “Okay, okay.” June said. “My husband is now no taller than a child’s doll and a hybrid horse.” Something tingled over June’s body and she quickly looked around to see she had raised in perspective again. That was extremely odd. “Me,” June said, pointing to herself. “Me, I’ve become an amazing hybrid Pteranodon, and I’ve also gotten younger. So I guess that makes me a Pteranodon girl. And I think I’m still getting taller.” June looked back to Ty, expecting him to say something.<br />
“Well,” Ty said, motioning towards the couch. “Why don’t you wake Mark and we’ll talk about it?”<br />
<br />
June nodded and took a seat on the couch, sitting down next to her immeasurably smaller and decidedly equine husband, the weight of her muscle and size pressing down the springs in the couch, making them creak. She was now standing 6’ 2” tall, and although she didn’t know it, her rate of growth was picking up speed.<br />
<br />
Ty quickly grabbed his housecoat from the floor and put it on, much to June’s relief. Although she felt a little uncomfortable sitting there naked in all of her pure reptilian glory, but then she decided it felt natural to have the open air on her skin. She reached down and gently picked up Mark, afraid she might break him, and adopting her maternal instinct, she cradled him in her arms, wings draping over her legs and across the couch.<br />
<br />
She grinned, looking at the snoozing equine face, so comfortable and content. Mark had always loved horses. This was so perfect for him. The novelty of having him small enough to hold in her arms was charming. But why was he so small? And how did this happen to the both of them? And how was Ty involved? Well, he said to wake Mark and they’d find out, so June gently rubbed the tiny horse’s nose and saw him slowly stir to consciousness.<br />
<br />
From Mark’s point of view, his eyes opened to find himself staring up at a tremendously sized beak that stretched up hundreds of feet and met with a pair of scary orange and yellow eyes that resembled but weren’t a cat’s. Mark screamed, and suddenly had a hand gently caressing his chest and soft female voice quickly telling him it was all right.<br />
<br />
“It’s me, darling!” The strange creature said. “It’s June, honey. It’s okay. Don’t be scared!”<br />
<br />
Mark blinked, recalling all that had happened to him so far today. What the hell had happened while he was asleep?!</p>
