<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just before we head out, Master approached Mia and handed her a dog leash with a collar attached. Instead of the usual dog tags though, a cow bell was attached to it. Obviously it was meant for me to wear, with me being a dairy cow and all. But did it really have to be cow patterned too? <br />
<br />
&quot;Mia, I take it that that is for me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems to be the case. I&#39;m so sorry about this Jen, but Master&#39;s orders are absolutes. I have to train you to be a proper dairy cow slave, even if I don&#39;t want to. And you must become one as well since Master ordered you to do so too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooooo, you&#39;re right. And you are going to be laying eggs. I can&#39;t even imagine how that will feel. Especially when Master eats them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I am kinda looking forward to it. Master will be enjoying something I was able to make for him. The only part I dislike us the eating bugs and worms portion, but even now my body seems to crave them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get what you mean. Grass to me is now super appetizing. And I bet how you feel about your eggs is similar to how I feel about my milk. I hope that I can be able to produce enough daily to ensure he can drink it whenever he wishes to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Well let&#39;s get you hooked up and go to homeroom. It should be starting soon. Are you going to use 2 legs or 4?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Which would you say makes me a better dairy cow slave? I have no idea on how to be a good one, so I actually really appreciate you being able to properly train me. I would be so lost without your guidance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Well my gut is telling me that you should be trained to be able to do both at any given moment. So I guess stick with all fours for now since walking on 2 legs is kind of already taken care of. But will you be able to manage with those heels and such?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I never even considered that to be a possible issue. Let me check.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly leaned forward and stood up with my hind legs, as I have decided to call them now since I am technically supposed to be walking on 4 &quot;legs&quot;. To my surprise though, the moment I raise my ass into the air, my arms, or fore legs now, also stretched to be matching my hind legs in height. My hands also reformed into a shape which was an exact copy of my heels. &quot;Look at this Mia, my hands now match my heels!&quot; I say excitedly. I was actually kind of relieved that it happened. Now I could oroperly stand comfortably on my 4 legs without having to bend my back. <br />
<br />
Mia put my collar on and began leading me to our homeroom. Sure I was getting some awkward extra attention from the other students, but for some reason I just didn&#39;t care. I was a dairy cow slave. If my Master was satisfied, why would I care about anyone other than Mia&#39;s opinion. She was my trainer, fellow sex slave, and best friend, so I felt she also deserved my acknowledgement. But it seems she didn&#39;t share my mentality, as the more people started to stare at her, the more uncomfortable she seemed to get. But at the same time, the more turned on she also got. I knew that her inner pervert would be leaking out soon enough too. Well, I had been giving it my all to conceal it up to now, but as a dairy cow, there was now a limit as to how much I could do to cover it up. Chances are I would just end up making it worse. Sorry Mia, but this is up to you to handle. <br />
<br />
When we reached homeroom, nearly everyone there was staring at us, specifically me though. Well, I guess they would stare. To them, I was a girl on a dog leash with her tits out, walking on all fours with a cow tail. Not a dairy cow slave. Hehe, I bet all of the girls in the classroom are jealous of my beautiful udders. Just keep on staring ladies, its not going to make you own any larger. Mia got to her seat, tied my leash to one of the desk legs and went to the teacher. <br />
<br />
I watched as Mia pulled a note from her cleavage and handed it to our teacher, Yuliya. She was arguably the hotest teacher in our school, and was still just 25.  She had very light brown hair, which she kept nearly white in color. She routinely bleached it, and even did her eyebrows too, in order to not get in trouble with the principle. Only a few students and teachers knew the truth though. <br />
<br />
Yuliya is currently in the middle of a very rough divorce. Something about how she caught her soon-to-be ex-husband sleeping with another man in their bed. But because of this, she refuses to be called by his last name, and asked the entire school to just use her first name, which worked out since no one else has her name. Even most students just call her Yuliya. <br />
<br />
Anyways, it seems whatever was written on that note must have been very convincing since Yuliya just nods her head and walks over to me, taking out some kind of metal ring that had come with the note it seems. Yuliya squats down in front of me in order to match my height. &quot;Hello Jen, I understand both of your situations, and I will do my best to support you both in serving our Master. But as your teacher, I feel that in order to do my job, I must ask if you are ok with all of this. Your position is different than Mia&#39;s and my own. We are both in human positions, as a maid and a driver respectively, while you are in an animal&#39;s position, and as a dairy cow at that. So I do not see a reason for you to even attend school if you don&#39;t feel like it. I have 1st period off, so I could drive you over to our estate and leave you to graze in the pasture until after school if you would like. Or I could let Mia continue to guide you around, but I cant say I would recommend it as I am sure that will get to be quite boring. Its up to you. Oh and just some advice, cows do not wear clothing, so I would remove everything but the heels as they actually kind of make your feet look closer to hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think it is ok with Master for me to leave school, then I would love to go. What about Mia though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will be comming with you, as she is your trainer. I figured that this would make it easier to train you too. Plus we have a milking machine for you, which is all set up and ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if you would drive us, I would love to go to our new home.&quot; Says Mia.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She says yes&quot; translates Mia.</p>
