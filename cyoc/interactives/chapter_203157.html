<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun shone out the window, striking Danny&#39;s eyes as he opened them. He rubbed his face in an effort to wake himself up. His hands paused as they felt the smooth face, devoid of any stubble from the previous night.<br />
<br />
Danny jumped out of bed. His boxers fell swiftly to the ground, and his undershirt was barely big enough to conceal his private parts. He picked up the boxers and tried his best to hold them up. Running straight to the bathroom, he was met with the fruit of the device’s labour.<br />
<br />
The bathroom counter went up to his belly button. The torso and chest itself were clear of any hairs. His arms and legs, similarly clear skinned, thinned considerably. His face rounded out, and his hair curled at the top.<br />
<br />
Standing before Danny was the pre-teen he had become.<br />
<br />
In disbelief, Danny took more photos of himself, albeit with a towel surrounding his waist and concealing his miniaturized member. One of the photos had a teenage Danny flex his arms in front of the mirror. Danny made the exact same pose he did the previous night, but his attempts at flexing were laughable at best. His arms looked the same flexing and unflexing.<br />
<br />
Danny guessed that his height dipped below 5 feet, but remembered the mark he had left on the door frame the previous night. He stood at 6 feet tall as of his previous physical two weeks prior. He glanced at the mark, which was just out of reach for him.<br />
<br />
Danny had a glimpse at his armpit while trying to reach the higher mark. Not a single strand of hair was present, and one whiff gave him nothing. However, he made a note to apply his usual deodorant for good measure.<br />
<br />
“Was I really that tall?” Danny asked before measuring himself again. The mark from the previous night was well above the mark he had just made. With the help of a computer chair, he measured the difference. The marks were over a foot apart, leaving him at a mere 4 feet 8 inches. The weight scale brought Danny another surprise as the number 74 was printed before his eyes. He whistled at the smaller number while wondering if his teenage self could bench press the body weight of a pre-teen.<br />
<br />
He reflected on his new measurements, which paled in comparison to the 6-foot 165-pound teen he was the previous night. Danny grinned at the mirror, complete with the gap separating his front teeth, when it had dawned on him. Fully stripped of his maturity, he was, by all accounts, a pre-teen again.<br />
<br />
“This is amazing!” Danny shouted. His excitement grew after hearing the soprano exit his mouth. That was his voice, around two octaves higher than normal. He laughed with joy at the realization that he was a pre-teen again.<br />
Danny looked up what the average heights for boys are at certain ages, and his height was within range for an 11-year-old. <br />
Although tempted to ask his parents to celebrate his 11th birthday instead of his 16th, the preteen instead returned to his room.<br />
<br />
He knew that he had to spend the next 24 hours as a pre-teen, but he already wanted to spend more time as one. He wondered how his friends would take the change. He also considered what his parents would do with their youthened son.<br />
<br />
Danny laid down on his bed, and unwrapped his towel. What was left of his genitalia was exposed; a pair of grapes accompanied by an uncooked cocktail sausage, all of which lacked any hair of any kind.<br />
<br />
He attempted to stroke it while thinking long and hard, but nothing came up. He didn&#39;t feel a thing. Even going through his phone for anything that might help, Danny learned that he no longer had any form of sexual attraction.<br />
<br />
“Amazing! This thing really did a number on me,” Danny said, reflecting on the five years worth of maturity that was taken from him, “I even feel like a kid!”<br />
Before long, Danny heard a knock on his door.<br />
<br />
“Danny, I&#39;ve got something to show you,” his mother announced from the other side. Danny was not ready to have his mom see him this way, but there was no choice.<br />
<br />
He creaked open the door, half unwilling to let his mom see his diminished form due to the embarrassment that was to follow.<br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness! Daniel Allister Jacobs, look how handsome you got!” his mom shouted before tightly wrapping her arms around him. Normally, her head would go up to his nose. Since becoming a pre-teen, his head could barely touch her chin.<br />
Danny was subject to an inordinate amount of smooches before breaking away from his mother&#39;s grasp. Still mentally a teenager, Danny blushed at having to look up at his mother.<br />
<br />
“Mom! I’m not a li&#39;l kid, ya know!” Danny complained.<br />
<br />
“I know, but it&#39;s so exciting to see you this much closer to being my little Magoo again,” his mother replied, “Anyway, I figured you were going to become like this, so I took some hand-me-downs from your cousin, Jackson. Quite the growth spurt for a 12-year-old if you ask me.”<br />
<br />
&quot;And I bet Jackson&#39;s taller than me now,&quot; Danny said preceding a fake laugh. He was uncomfortable with having his cousin see him as the pre-teen he transformed into. However, he was excited about being able to wear the smaller clothes.<br />
<br />
Danny took the boxes of old clothes his dad had left for him. Although much heavier on his scrawny limbs, he dug deep and brought them to his room before dropping the boxes.<br />
<br />
“Mom, do you mind?” Danny asked as he gestured his mom to close the door.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry dear,” his mom replied, “By the way, how old are you now?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno,” Danny answered before observing his newly prepubescent body, “Probably 11?”<br />
<br />
“Okay then, happy 11th birthday, Danny,” his mom said, “Come downstairs when you&#39;re finished. Another surprise should be here soon.”<br />
<br />
Curious about the surprise, Danny was quick to drop the towel and comb through the hand-me-downs. He was about to wear the same clothes that fit his cousin Jackson months before. A blue t-shirt with a shark motif was a better fit than the undershirt he had woken up in. The tighty-whities that his mom provided were a reminder that Danny, while not a little kid, was not exactly a teen either. The green cargo shorts fit perfectly along his smaller waist, and the ankle socks might as well have been made for his feet.<br />
<br />
Danny slid down the bannister, which he was light enough to do without any injury. Though brief, he enjoyed the thrill of being able to do so again. The missing maturity was starting to make him feel like a child. He walked into the kitchen, anxious about what his surprise might be.</p>
