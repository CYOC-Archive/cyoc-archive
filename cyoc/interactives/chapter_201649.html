<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luis admitted that most likely, they&#39;d have to edit a little bit of what was gonna happen here out. After all, they couldn&#39;t well show what Carla very obviously wanted from Luis on network television. So it was good they were getting it out of the way here before the cameras started following them everywhere. It wasn&#39;t like Luis really blamed Carla for wanting him. So many people did. He even swore he caught the middle aged woman he talked to about their show checking out his ass on the way out. Showed how much value she put on that marriage band on her finger!<br />
<br />
The <i>perils</i> of being drop dead gorgeous. Yeah Luis had a bit of an ego, but he&#39;d had a lot of time to cultivate it.<br />
<br />
As Carla led the way upstairs &quot;to get a look at a reportedly quite haunted room, supposedly the ghost of the wife walks through&quot;, it was clear enough to Luis what was really going on. The others mostly focused on their own locations within the house. That, or setting up spirit boxes and recording devices, meant to see if they could capture any ghostly recordings. Of course, Carla figured she had time to get involved in that kind of thing. <br />
<br />
At least when she wasn&#39;t enjoying the sights. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Luis started as he walked into the upstairs room, a master bedroom that still had everything in surprisingly good condition, &quot;Getting me alone in a haunted house all for this...just couldn&#39;t wait to get your hands on me, eh?&quot; He chuckled.<br />
<br />
Carla sauntered up to Luis, making her case more obvious, &quot;You are legit one of the sexiest men I&#39;ve ever seen around here. Your face is so pretty, and your body...oh it ripples...&quot; Luis tensed his arm as she reached to feel his bicep. He was used to this he supposed. Women - and men too! - just loved the way his look was. Shredded, muscular physique, pretty boy features, he was leading man material if any studio gave him a chance.<br />
<br />
He figured this ghost hunting shit was a passable way to do that - on top of it suiting his thrill seeking tendencies.<br />
<br />
Before long, Carla pressed her hips against Luis&#39; groin, and started kissing him - he returned it after a moment, and let her just grind herself on him. Let her think he was just gonna stand there---and then he moved. Luis at once took off his shirt and swooped down, grabbing her up by her legs and back, bridal carrying her over to the massive bed in the corner. She laughed and gasped as Luis put her on the bed and started kissing her much more intensely.<br />
<br />
Cupping her breasts and expertly undoing her bra after taking off her jacket and blouse, tossing them over the side of the bed. &quot;Oh, ohh Luis...Luis you are so strong! So big!&quot; <br />
<br />
<i>Missy, you have not seen big yet.</i> Luis thought with a grin as he started kicking and undoing his jeans, getting them off and kicking those to the back of the bed as soon as he was able. Clad only in a pair of tight black boxers, Luis started pulling off Carla&#39;s own jeans - and her panties before long as well - before beginning to grind against her. He let her feel how big his cock was, deciding she needed to get a feeling for it long before he actually put that monster to work.<br />
<br />
They kissed - Carla moaning between the mingling of their tongues - enjoying the hot feeling of Luis on top of her. She relished in the sight of his muscles on display, working and flexing as he engaged with her. Eventually, she managed to get him back, and moved forward fast - knowing he wanted to keep thrusting away. Tease her all the more. She pinned his muscular thighs briefly and started teasing him right back - taking his boxer-clad cock into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Even through the fabric, Luis was very obviously large, and the fabric was just thin enough to let him feel the first inklings of Carla&#39;s blowjob. &quot;Aww yes, la monada---si! Si!&quot; Luis gulped, feeling her fingers against his skin - and his boxers were off. His cock sprang up between them, fully erect at 9.5 inches. <br />
<br />
Carla paused outright at the sheer sight of it, stating, &quot;You---You have a huge---!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big muscle man, big dick, babe.&quot; Luis bragged, and then said, &quot;K-Keep it going. You know I love your blowjobs.&quot; For his part, Luis relaxed and then let out a low groan as he felt her start taking that cock into her mouth. Not many women could get all of him in there, but it seemed Carla was doing it - and doing it well, too! His abs flexed a little as he leaned back, sweat starting to dart down his brow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh siiiii, babe,&quot; Luis groaned, &quot;That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right...ohh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Little did the two lovebirds know, they had two voyeurs in particular.<br />
<br />
The one was Todd Ramos, waiting outside the door. He&#39;d gone up after them to try and get Luis&#39; help with a particularly stubborn cellar door - and when he creaked the door open a little, the two were so far into their sexual episode neither heard nor noticed Todd looking in at them. Watching the sexual act unfold - and for his part, Todd felt turned on - reminded of all the porn he&#39;d viewed on the internet. A perfect, muscular man on top of a beautiful, athletic woman. Even though it was his friends, Todd became engulfed in the pornographic aspect of it. He could just...watch this...go on for as long as it took.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s pants fell to the floor, his tighty-whities strained by his own erection. He started to reach inside them to beat off, knowing full well he hadn&#39;t cum in three days - so he was likely more than a little pent up. <i>Luis is so fucking perfect. It&#39;s almost infuriating. He&#39;s ripped, he&#39;s good-looking, and he&#39;s got just...ohh fuck. Carla&#39;s got the best boobs at the school, and she&#39;s so sexy and she knows it. She knows how to really...play it. I know I shouldn&#39;t fall for the---the that kind of woman, but is this erection lying?</i><br />
<br />
Todd however was not the only voyeur.<br />
<br />
The Black Stallion watched outside, through the window, seeing everything that went on - and its eyes flashed a crimson red. It knew the time was here to begin the changes. Slow, gradual - but they&#39;d eventually overcome these would-be ghost hunters. Nothing overwhelming to start with. Guarantee they don&#39;t go running out of there. He liked what he saw in there. Luis and his tight, muscular build - the sexy and intelligent Carla (who might be able to lure more people back here) - and the eager and sexually deprived Todd.</p>
