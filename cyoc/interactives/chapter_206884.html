<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This had not been a good day for Van. Sure, Rider was back in from being sick so his workload wasn&#39;t as bad as it had been yesterday, he even got to meet with Greg for lunch, though some of his former coworkers ribbed them a bit for it. Still, the day went on and on, still radio silence from Paul, and even worse, Abaltis hadn&#39;t reared his ginger head all day. It was making Van jumpy. No changes, no taunts, it was almost like the fairy had lost interest. Van also noticed his diminished mental state more and more as the day went on. He&#39;d take peaks at reports or monitors, always hoping to make sense of what was on it, but it all looked like gibberish. When he let himself forget his problems and just work, he was fairly happy with it too. There was just something about fixing something broken that felt good. He consoled himself with telling himself it was just a different kind of smarts. Not everyone could fix a leaky pipe, that&#39;s why they had him.<br />
<br />
Other memories had been slipping in through the day. He still had his same friend group through high school, but he had a different spot in it. The other two were somewhat protective of him, almost like older brothers though they were the same age. He was a steady C student, and only with tutoring from the other two. He had done sports, but never made it in to college. Instead he bounced around some minimum wage grunt jobs until he helped Greg do some repairs in his new home and in return helped him get his current job.<br />
<br />
He was humming blissfully as he stepped into his apartment after his post-work work out. For one day since Friday, his day actually seemed to be going well. He didn&#39;t hate his new job and the pay actually wasn&#39;t too much lower than what he made as a code monkey, surprisingly. Though neither had been great, he would only need to tighten the budget a little. Grabbing a beer out of the fridge, he intended to repeat yesterday evening, but stopped in his tracks when he saw his computer up and a program open. He could see some of his apartment on the screen and realized the webcam was on.<br />
<br />
He quickly rushed over and sat at his desk, the camera now displaying a shot of his tank covered torso, the neck low enough to expose the top of his brown furred pecs. He was looking for a way to shut down the program, or even what it was doing when some text popped up next to the camera display.<br />
<br />
&#39;There you are. Mmm.. gonna take off that shirt?&#39;<br />
<br />
Van stared at the words. Was it actually streaming him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Show me that chest&#39;<br />
&#39;Wanna stick my face in those pecs&#39;<br />
<br />
Different user names. How many were watching. He finally found a way to close the program then a little alert popped up below the chat that someone had dropped fifty dollars in his online wallet. Did he even have an online wallet?<br />
<br />
&#39;More if you take off that shirt&#39;<br />
<br />
Van bit his lip. Well, that was quite a bit of money, and that might solve his budget issues. Plus, it was just his shirt. He leaned back in his chair, the video showing him from the knees up, but cutting off just around his jaw, keeping his face out of the screen. He ran a hand down the front of his tank top, still a little sweaty from the gym, gripped the bottom and began to pull it up. First exposing his abs and their trimmed coating of hair that only looked to make the groves in his stomach more obvious. Another twenty dropped into his wallet followed by another ten.<br />
<br />
This was the easiest money he had made in his whole life. He lifted his shirt high enough to expose one pec, groping and squeezing it, giving his large nipple a tweak.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh man, I wanna suck that man tit so bad&#39;<br />
<br />
Another twenty dropped as he lifted his shirt over his head and tossed it aside. A few more mall donations rolled in as he did some flexes he had seen from guys at the gym, and more as he pulled down the top of his shorts a bit, revealing the top of his pubes. He even felt himself getting a little hard at the thought of all these people paying to watch him strut his stuff. Engrossed as he was and with his head out of frame he didn&#39;t notice his hair beginning to bleach, going from brown to a golden blond, or even when it did reach his beard, some of which was in frame. Nor as the golden color spread out from the center of his chest as he ran his fingers through his chest hair.  His eyes were fixed on the comments and suggestions rolling in.<br />
<br />
One had him standing up and turning around, showing his ass to the camera. He pulled down his shorts to below his peach fuzz covered globes, bouncing them and massaging them for the camera. It was starting to get him hard, enough that when he turned sideways comments started rolling in about his bulge.<br />
<br />
&#39;Look at that monster&#39;<br />
&#39;No way, gotta be fake&#39;<br />
&#39;Bet it&#39;s real&#39;<br />
&#39;Hundred to show us&#39;<br />
<br />
Van licked his lips. There was already nearly five hundred sitting there for him, but he started running his hand along the waistband of his gym shorts, nestled in his golden blond pubes. He slowly began to lower them, first revealing just the base of his shaft and its girth, which elicited a few more comments from the chat, then he lowered his shorts inch by inch to reveal more and more of his shaft until his head popped free. His donations shot up almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&#39;Holy crap, I could choke on that and die happy&#39;<br />
&#39;Fucking horse&#39;<br />
&#39;!!!&#39;<br />
<br />
Someone must have tagged something because a few more users suddenly popped into his stream. He sat in his chair and began to stroke himself, grinning as he saw more money rolling on in. Did this count as being a porn star? Or at least a porn actor. He grinned as he kept stroking off, making sure the camera had a good shot of his hands on the shaft as he worked his fairy magicked tool. At some encouragement from the chat he found it was long enough that he could at least lick the head of his own cock, his salty pre tasting oddly good on his tongue.<br />
<br />
Eventually his stream got a good view of him cumming, shot after shot of seed launching from his dick, some of it landing on his golden furred torso, some on the floor, one shot even hit his face near his mouth, which he licked partially clean without even thinking. Panting and grinning, he spied the nearly thousand dollars he made with his little show. He shot the camera a peace sign, then typed in a &#39;Till next time&#39; and logged himself out.<br />
<br />
Clapping came from the corner of his apartment, and he turned to see Abaltis sitting there, covered in some of his own cum, which was oddly sparkly. With a wave of his hand the fairy cleaned himself off and stood. &quot;Nice show. You could make a living doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you?&quot; Van started, sitting up a little more in his chair, gripping the arm rests. &quot;Did you make me do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a soft snort from the fairy. &quot;I&#39;ll admit I made your account and left it open on your computer for you to find, but no, that was all you. Seems my little pet is turning into a bit of an exhibitionist.&quot; The word seemed to slip by Van, which produced a sigh from Abaltis. &quot;You like showing off that body I gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van gulped. &quot;So what did you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured you needed an easy day after yesterday, and as much as I don&#39;t like stereotypes I thought you&#39;d make a cute blond. I was right. My cute, blond, himbo.&quot; Abaltis took Van&#39;s chin in his hand and lifted it up a little, leaning in to plant a firm kiss on Van&#39;s lips, one he found hard to back away from, one he found much to his surprise to be enjoyable. Near the end he even leaned into it a little. &quot;What do you say, ready to be my pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Van gulped, then slowly shook his head. &quot;No..&quot;<br />
<br />
Abaltis chuckled. &quot;Let me let you in on a secret. You might think you can last, but no one has ever resisted more than two weeks on this little deal, and you are giving in quicker than you think. Besides, it&#39;s not as restrictive as you think pet, I might even let you have your own partner as long as I still get mine.&quot; He looked over to the door as a knock sounded on it.<br />
<br />
Van looked down at the mess he had made, including his own cum covered chest. &quot;Allow me.&quot; Abaltis said, snapping his fingers and making the cum on Van and the floor vanish, along with himself. There was another knock on the door and Van grabbed his shorts, tugging them on as he ran over to answer it.</p>
