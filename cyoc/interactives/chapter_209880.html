<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff/”Jane” walks out of the clothing store, she is unaware of a boy nearby who stops dead in his track, his eyes wide in surprise, when he spots the “girl”. The boy’s name is “Tyler”, and he is none other than Jane’s ex-boyfriend, who Jeff does not know anything off, because Jane never introduced Tyler to Jeff. Tyler is a 16-year-old boy, with short blond spikey hair, blue eyes and an athletic body, his skin has a natural light brown tone. When Jane and Tyler first met at the beach, Jane felt comfortable in his presence, she felt loved, but that soon changed after just a month of dating. Tyler started to become more and more obsessed and commanding, showing signs of wanting to control Jane, to have her obey him. When Jane told him she has had enough of his attitude, that he scares her and that she decided to break up with him, caused Tyler to become mad. The boy started to stalk the girl, until Jane’s parents threatened to call the cops, the last thing Tyler said to Jane was, “you’ll be sorry,” but he stopped stalking her, not wanting to have problems with the cops. The dangerous thing about Tyler is, not only is he a psychopath… he is a SMART psychopath.<br />
<br />
After the first shock had subsided, Tyler starts to grin evilly, “Jane has become so hot,” he says to himself, keeping his eyes on the girl, “it has been months since I last saw her. It is a good thing that I kept track of her, without her noticing.” Tyler starts to follow Jeff/”Jane”, making sure to keep his distance, not wanting to be spotted by the “girl”. Even though Tyler had promised to stay away from Jane, the boy continued to stalk the girl, but he always made sure to not be seen. When Tyler watch Jane meeting up with other boys, he started to become more and more angrier and jealous, “Jane is mine,” he always told himself, “no other boy has the right to touch or look at her. No one will take her away from me, I’ll make sure of that.”<br />
<br />
Tyler started to try and come up with a plan to get HIS Jane back, a few months later, he found the answer to his “problem”: The Chronivac!<br />
<br />
After reading what the program is able to do, Tyler could not help but grin evilly, he downloaded the App-version onto his phone, and after some minor tests, like changing his hair color and transforming a cat into a plush, Tyler decided to use the program on Jane. “With this device,” the boy had thought, “I will be able to get MY Jane back and make everyone be okay with us being together. I’ll make sure she’ll only have eyes for ME!”<br />
<br />
Tyler had tried to come up with a plan how to scan Jane, but every time he saw her, the girl was either with her family, her friends or one of her “boyfriends”. The teen wanted to get Jane by herself, to prevent any interference with his plan, so seeing her all by herself in the mall, the boy could not believe his luck. “This is my chance to get Jane,” the boy says to himself as he follows “Jane” through the mall, already his phone in hand, conflicted with if he should just scan her or go and say “hi”.<br />
<br />
While he tries to decide, Tyler notices “Jane” heading straight for the gaming store, the boy stops and raises an eyebrow, “I had no idea she enjoyed video games,” he says to himself, he then smiles, “now I love her even more,” he then follows the “girl” into the store.<br />
<br />
After a while of watching Jane check out the racks of games, Tyler decides to walk up and talk to her. The boy takes a deep breath and walks slowly towards her, “h-hey… Jane,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Jane” turns around, wondering who it could be, the former boy sees a handsome looking 16-year-old standing behind him. Tyler is at least a head taller than “Jane”, “hi,” the “girl” says, “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
At the girl’s response Tyler looks surprised, “hu? Aren’t you Jane Davis?”<br />
<br />
Jeff is about to say he is, but a thought pops into his mind, ‘better not say I am “Jane”,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I don’t want the real “Jane” to get into some kind of trouble.’ Jeff opens his mouth, “sorry,” he says, “I think you mistook me for someone else. My name is Amber… Amber Jones” he says.<br />
<br />
Tyler is totally taken aback, “oh… sorry…,” he says, “you look exactly like my ex.” The teen stares at “Amber”, ‘I can’t believe that there is a nother girl out there who looks just like Jane…,’ he thinks to himself. Tyler then grins inwardly, as a thought pops into his mind, ‘if I can’t have the original… I’ll just take the next best thing.’<br />
<br />
Jeff is unaware of Tyler’s thoughts, the “girl” smiles kindly, “that is okay,” he says, “sorry to have awaken dark memories. What is your name, if you don’t mind me asking?” Jeff is unaware that Tyler will assume that “Amber” has an interest in him, why else would she ask for his name? In truth though, Jeff/”Amber” is just being friendly, ‘I never saw him,’ Jeff thinks to himself as he waits for a reply, ‘Jane never introduced him to me.’<br />
<br />
“R-right, sorry,” Tyler says, “my name is Tyler… Tyler Jordan.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, Tyler feels himself melting in the “girl’s” smile, “what a nice name,” she says.<br />
<br />
Tyler blushes and rubs the back of his neck, “it… it is nothing special,” he says, “but th-thanks.” There is a long silence before Tyler asks, “I… I never saw a girl interested in video games. I thought girls were… you know… “girly”: interested in ponies, dolls and such. How come you are?”<br />
<br />
Jeff raises an eyebrow, he then chuckles, which comes out like a giggle, “well, some of us girls,” she says, “are also interested in “boy stuff”. I personally enjoy soccer, basketball, American football and shooter.”<br />
<br />
Tyler is amazed, “wow…,” he says, “hehe… so you’re a real “tom boy”, hm?”<br />
<br />
“Hehe,” Jeff laughs, “you could say that.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of games do you have,” the boy asks, ‘man… I really made a lucky catch with this chick. She is even better than that bitch Jane! Amber is interested in stuff I enjoy, where Jane just scoffed at.’<br />
<br />
‘Tyler seems like a cool guy,’ Jeff thinks to himself, “oh, almost every Call Of Duty, Doom, Wolfenstein, Halo… those are games I enjoy.”<br />
<br />
Tyler widens his eyes in surprise, then he chuckles, “and I always thought girls were soft,” he says, he then smiles at “Amber”, “looks like I was wrong, hu?”<br />
<br />
“Amber” grins, “hehe... seems like it,” she says, “let me guess, you also enjoy shooters?”<br />
<br />
Tyler nods, “I LOVE &#39;em,” he replies, “my most favorite is the new Call of Duty game.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” the “girl” asks, “I assume you are talking about the new Modern Warfare 2, right?”<br />
<br />
“I sure am,” Tyler says, “have you played it?”<br />
<br />
“Amber” shakes her head, “nah, not yet. I watched some gameplays on YouTube, and I thought the story looked amazing, especially the graphics. Sadly, I have not much money left, after all the clothes shopping.”<br />
<br />
This causes Tyler to laugh, “I guess you are a “typical” girl,” he says, “spending all your money on clothes and make up.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” pouts, “hey, a girl has to look her best,” she replies, she then grins, “even a “Tomboy” like myself.”<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles at the “girl”, &#39;she is amazing,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;we&#39;d make such a perfect couple. I need to play it smart, I hope she is single and in search of a boyfriend, if not... well, I got my little “helper” who&#39;ll sort that issue out for me.&#39; He then looks at “Amber”, “listen, since you seem to want the game so badly,” he says, “I&#39;d be happy to pay for it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” is taken aback, “thanks Tyler,” she says, “that is really sweet of you, but I rather buy it myself. I can wait another month or so,” she adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Tyler nods, “well, think about it,” he says, smiling, “the offer continues to stand. What have you planned for the rest of the day?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing much,” “Amber” says, “I think I&#39;ll head home and get my shopping sorted.”<br />
<br />
Tyler is about to ask if she&#39;d like him to help her carry her bags, but decides against it, &#39;I can wait until she invites me over sometime,&#39; he thinks. “Okay,” he then says, “um... w-would you like to meet up again sometime?”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” thinks for a while, &#39;Tyler sure is a cool and kind guy. It would not hurt to hang out with him from time to time as “Amber”. He has not even made any “certain” moves and has not been to flirty with me.&#39; The “girl” smiles, “sure, I&#39;d like to get to know you more,” she says, “how about we meet at the park at around 2pm tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
Tyler beams, “it&#39;s a date,” he says, grinning.<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” chuckles, assuming Tyler means it in a joking way, unaware that Tyler really sees the “meeting up again” as a actual date. “So, I guess I&#39;ll see you tomorrow,” the “girl” then says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Tyler replies, “most defiantly!”<br />
<br />
Both say good bye and “Amber” starts to walk away, unaware that Tyler has made up his mind to make her HIS. The boy watches “Amber” leave, he then grins, &#39;soon... my princess,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;very soon... you&#39;ll be MINE!”</p>
