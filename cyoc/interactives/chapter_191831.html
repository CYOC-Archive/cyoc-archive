<br />
<b>Codename:</b> ‘The Eddy Eggplant Show’<br />
<br />
<b>Description:</b> E-650, ‘The Eddy Eggplant Show’, is a children’s television show appearing on channels throughout North America.  <br />
<br />
E-650 is a variety show featuring live-action skits, and some animated segment. Live-action segments are hosted by Eddy Eggplant, an eggplant mascot played by an unknown actor in a felt suit. He is accompanied by Silly Sally, a pink-dressed ‘neighbor girl’ played by a different young woman in each episode. They take part in various activities in Eddy Eggplant’s house, the backyard, and the nearby woods, all of which are artificial sets.<br />
<br />
Other characters include (but are not limited to): <br />
•	Dingleberry Dan, a wild west cowboy who would often get into slapsticks, while trying to be helpful. <br />
•	Lovey Bunny, a puppet rabbit who often appears in skits with Silly Sally. In some episodes, she appears in her own segment, called ‘Lovey Bunny Playtime!’, in which she demonstrates kid activities or tells stories.  Occasionally, she also starts in her own animated shorts called &#39;Lovey Bunny Magic!&#39;, as a magical bunny girl.<br />
•	Wendy the Witch, a witch who’s often exasperated by other characters trespassing on her home, or stealing her magical items. <br />
•	Rascal Red, a fox-eared man in a beany hat, and whisker face paint. He would often make trouble for the rest of the cast, in many cases tying up Silly Sally, with the other cast having to save her. <br />
•	Lil’ Cupid, an animated winged cupid boy who stars in his own animated shorts, called &quot;Lil’ Cupid Adventures&quot;. In each short, Lil’ Cupid stops various mythical creatures from causing trouble, while also helping characters out. He has magic arrows which can transform people, or make them fall in love. <br />
<br />
E-650 does not appear on programming slots of any official TV channels, and is considered an unauthorized broadcast. In all sightings, the show would replace a 30- minute program originally scheduled for 5:00pm, with no knowledge from the channel’s management. Runtime is a total of 24-minutes, with commercial breaks totaling 6 minutes (no anomalies have been found in these ad breaks).<br />
<br />
The show broadcasts on an irregular basis, often picking random days to air episodes. It is most often shown on local satellite channels with family programming, along with public access networks. There have been scant reports of E-650 appearing on popular cable networks, including [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. <br />
<br />
More unusually, the show would only appear on TV sets in households with children under 13 years old. Additionally, the E-650 has memory-affecting effects on both children and adults, which obscure the true nature of E-650. <br />
<br />
Due to this, public knowledge of E-650 is limited. The majority of known E-650 witnesses were found in online communities focused on transformation fetishes.<br />
<br />
The first known witness report of E-650 was a Usenet post from October 2nd, 1992, on the newsgroup “alt.sex.transformation”. The post was made by user MrHorseCock, later identified as then-18 year old Michael Sawyer of North Carolina. <br />

<i>Doubt anyone here knows, but has anyone watched the ‘Eddy Eggplant Show’ when they were kids? It was this weird show starring a talking eggplant (guy in a suit) and a girl named Silly Sally, It came up every 5:00 in the afternoon on our local channel in Concord, NC, and I can remember there being a LOT of transforming in it. <br />
<br />
I can’t remember much specific, but I know Silly Sally gets turned into animals and other things, usually because of a bad fox guy. Theres also a cartoon involving a cupid kid, and the kid’s turned into this buff horse guy by a wizard. I’ll be honest, ever since watching that, I’ve had this fantasy about turning into big dick stallion guy, even when I was 11 fucking years old.  <br />
<br />
I think that show really screwed me up, haha. I kinda wish I can watch it again, but I’ve no idea where to find it. Asked my parents about it, but they have no idea.   <br />
<br />
Anyone remember this show? </i><br />

<i>Dude, what the fuck. I live in Winnipeg Canada, and I know that exact show you’re talking about. I always thought I just hallucinated it. <br />
<br />
I remember the parts you mentioned.  The Cupid cartoon was called &#39;Lil&#39; Cupid&#39;, and he&#39;d and other characters turn into a bunch of things. I remember in one episode he turns into a grown woman and seduces a villain. Couldn&#39;t believe they&#39;d have that in a kids show. <br />
<br />
There was TF in the live action parts too. Fox guy was called Rascal Red, I think. He&#39;s usually the one turning people, but there&#39;s also a magical witch in the show. I remember in one episode, a cowboy guy and Silly Sally turning into dogs because of the witch potion, and falling in love. And it wasn’t an instant TF or anything, we got to see them turning slowly, like zooming in on body parts as they morph, and their faces pushing out into snouts, with clothes slipping off. Not gonna lie, I blew my first load to that (even if there wasn’t really anything dirty).  <br />
<br />
I think there’s also this rabbit puppet who’d turn into a girl with bunny ears in a cartoon, and then she can swap between his forms? She’d then help out a cartoon little girl, and sometimes they’d both TF too. </i><br />

<i>I remember it. There was a fox-bad guy who kept tying up and gagging the pink girl. I remember once, he turned her into a talking tree with some transform ray gun, and then when Eddy Eggplant tried turning her back, she became an actual live-action goat instead. And then he milked her. <br />
<br />
Kid me thought it was hot.</i><br />

<br />
After further mentions of ‘Eddy Eggplant’ in the next few days, the G.E.T. Collective tracked down all Usenet users who posted of their relation to E-650. All witnesses gave testimony, before being given a standard, post interview memory-wipe. <br />
<br />
It was assumed that E-650 only had minor mental effects, and not actual bodily transformations. This would delegate the entity to the [REDACTED] Bureau, which specializes in non-transformative entities.  <br />
<br />
However, by order of the Class 1 Executive Council, a standard Entity Task Force was set up to monitor any mentions of “the Eddy Eggplant Show” in public discourse. It was soon discovered that E-650 had been broadcast throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico (with Mexico broadcasts being dubbed in Spanish, and known as ‘Bono Berenjena!’). <br />
<br />
Most witnesses to the show were between ages of 5-13 at the time, and have all shown sexual deviancy as teens and/or adults, with notable interest towards transformation fetishes. Younger viewers have also experienced sexual activity at an earlier age, with a masturbation habit for children as young as 6 years old, an increased libido, and an earlier onset of puberty by 1 to 2 years. At least eleven witnesses had attempted bestiality acts with pets and farm animals, and many had shown interest in incest, BDSM, scat, and other taboo sexual interests.<br />
<br />
Entity Task Force 650 (ETF-650) sought to witness the show’s broadcast. To do this, 600 children (including children of G.E.T. volunteers, and age-regressed Class 5 agents) were employed to watch local TV channels around the United States and Canada, every day at 5:00pm on all time zones in North America. Their televisions would be recorded through both a video camera, and a VCR recorder. To increase chances of the broadcast appearing, the child subjects would periodically be left unsupervised by adults.    <br />
<br />
To prevent long-lasting effects from E-650, all non-agent children would be amnesticized upon the operation’s conclusion. Memory wipes are also offered to G.E.T. agents who volunteered their children, along with a wage bonus and leave time. <br />

<br />
<b><i>Incident 650-01</i></b><br />
<br />
On March 10 1993, the two children of Class 4 operative [REDACTED] caught a broadcast of ‘the Eddy Eggplant Show’, from a house in [REDACTED], Michigan. They had been watching MCTV-22, a public access channel owned by PBS.  <br />
<br />
Agent [REDACTED] was present at the time, and had prepared the VCR recorder, while he also held a Sony-brand video camcorder. For unknown reasons, the VCR recorder only taped the original program which E-650 had replaced in that timeslot (‘3-2-1 Contact!’), rather than E-650 itself. No anomalous effects were found from viewing the VCR recording. <br />
<br />
The camcorder footage, however, showed much of the E-650 broadcast, along with other anomalies. A full log of the footage can be found in the link below this article, along with a post-incident report. <br />
<br />
Agent [REDACTED] has requested that he and his children’s names be removed from this report. He has also requested for his children to be immediately mind-wiped of the entire incident, and monitored until adulthood. These requests were granted. <br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
Almost none of the show’s staff members have been identified. In all direct observations of the episode’s end credits, names have been replaced by gibberish text, varying between each episode. <br />
<br />
The only legible name is the show’s executive producer, ‘Jeffrey D. Garnier’, a puppeteer for [REDACTED] Workshop reported missing since 1985. Garnier has no known criminal record, and little is known about his childhood or personal life. <br />
<br />
Garnier’s mother, Susan Garnier, was a member of a religious commune known as the Family of Inanna, located near Long Lake, New York. All members of the commune disappeared shortly before June 9th,1980, when a fire razed down their compound (see document - ‘FBI Raids Long Lake Sex Cult’ ). No bodies or remains were discovered. At least one VHS tape had been found, containing footage of children performing a ritualistic orgy, before [REDACTED].   <br />
<br />
A logo card appears after E-650’s end credits, naming the show’s production company as ‘New Venus Studios’. However, the only address linked to ‘New Venus Studios’ is an abandoned warehouse in Milford, Connecticut. No traces of television production have been found.<br />
<br />
<b>Containment:</b><br />
<br />
As suppression of the broadcast itself is not yet possible, containment will be focused on hiding the anomalous nature of E-650. This involves erasing all knowledge of the ‘Eddy Eggplant Show’, and mitigating any of its negative effects.<br />
<br />
Mentions of E-650 will be monitored on Usenet, the Internet, and other communication networks. Informants in the print-publishing industry will also monitor for any written mention of E-650. Any witnesses of E-650 should be tracked down, interviewed, and amneticized.<br />
<br />
Per the Executive Council’s recommendations, witnesses should only have memories of the show itself erased. Unless witnesses are underaged at the time of interview <b>OR</b> have committed sex crimes since watching the broadcast, any effort to alter their sexual behavior is unnecessary.<br />
<br />
<b>Other:</b><br />
<br />
E-650 has continued broadcasting in North America, with a modern update to the show’s aesthetic. Recently, reports have emerged of E-650’s appearances on European, Indian and South American TV channels, complete with language dubbing. Clips and entire episodes have also been uploaded to Youtube and other streaming sites, from multiple users. Upon testing, all the videos have proven to be anomalous, with similar effects as the televised version of E-650.<br />
<br />
Containment efforts are ongoing.</p>
