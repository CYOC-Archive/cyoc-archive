<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle sat there messaging his now massive breasts, thinking as he did so, trying to figure out how to undo all of this mess. He sighed and finally lay back, groaning in his womanly voice. &quot;You really fucked it up this time Kyle, you shouldn&#39;t have called Jarred.&quot; He lay there for a few while, feeling the busty amazon he now was taking up most of his bed, feet hanging off the end of the now almost too small twin size bed, thinking to himself and finally realizing that he had no choices now. If he used the curse on his mother again he could ruin her life, even if he could convince her of what had happened, if he tried to use it on someone else it could backfire even harder, and he couldn&#39;t even convince anyone that he was a woman from the neck down or the opposite for his mother. <br />
<br />
Finally giving up, Kyle sat up, and sighed. &quot;Well... it&#39;s all mine now.... may as well see it nude.&quot; He shivered, still considering this his mother&#39;s body, he worked up the courage to take off his shirt, his massive breasts dropped out of the shirt, he had expected them to sag a little more, but they sat proud, much like implants. It then occurred to him that part of Jen&#39;s curse was that any and all health problems would be corrected, which meant that this body he now possessed had aged backwards, but kept all of it&#39;s milfy goodness, it also meant that it was still growing. Kyle gulped, &quot;How big could I get....&quot; He reached up and grabbed one of his breasts, and shivered, he then raised his hand, looking at the back and palm of it, the wrinkles he had seen on her hand were gone, flesh now supple and young. Kyle shot up and peeled off his pants and boxers, which had changed to adjust to his new size, but were still skin tight, he walked over to the mirror and looked at himself. <br />
<br />
He had seen his mother in shorts, and had known her legs to be flabby and covered in cellulose, but the legs he saw on himself were smooth and firm, thicker than when she had owned them, and longer too, seemingly all of that extra foot he grew was in his legs. His skin was a subtle tan, not deep, but not fake, it was obvious the previous owner of this body had taken good care of it, yet here it was in better shape than it had been in years. He examined his rear, his hips and ass a plumped, but not grown by much, his breasts now matched the width of his hips, giving him a truly hour glass figure. Everything about this body screamed sex, above all of this, attached to a long, and beautiful neck was Kyle&#39;s pale teenage face, the curse had only changed everything below his neck, making his head mismatched to this body, and how mismatched it was. <br />
<br />
Kyle had always been shorter than his mom in the first place, but with the extra growth and changes that Jarred had provided him, his head was even smaller atop this mountain of a woman, this made a truly awkward sight, not that anyone would see it. And then it finally clicked, no one would ever know, no one would ever see him differently, they would all think he was still his short and lanky self, or at least they would all treat him as tall with this body, he would have to figure it out later. He realized that this was a wet dream come true, he was secretly a milf, and no one knew but him and Jen, and even better, it was all his, this was his body now, and he could do with is as he pleased. Kyle reached down and finally touched his pussy, feeling the strangeness of his new anatomy, he backed off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later, but still...&quot; He grabbed his breasts, &quot;All mine!&quot; He squealed, finally realizing he could live his greatest fantasies, he still worried about his mother, but there was nothing he could do about that. He went over to his dresser and grabbed a pair of underwear, and practically danced his way to the shower. Kyle spent and hour and a half messaging and cleaning his new amazon self, enjoying every sensation, even nearly playing with himself, but still too shy to get off, he decided to go topless for the rest of the day and just enjoy the view.<br />
 <br />
It was six when his mom had walked through the front door, he got up and met her in the kitchen, wanting to see if she would notice anything off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello honey...&quot; Kyle mom said to him, looking at him in the eyes, theory tested, they would treat him as tall as he was physically, Kyle for his part had to bend somewhat, to see over his gargantuan bust, &quot;Are you feeling better? Are you hot? Your not running a fever are you?&quot; He bent down and she felt his head, &quot;No, just didn&#39;t feel like a shirt today?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was feeling kinda hot earlier, but I&#39;m better now I think.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, I was worried all day, I&#39;ll get dinner ready soon. Momma needs some rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can get things started, what are we having?&quot; Kyle smiled, and after getting the answer, he tried to keep his composure to fake having been sick for most of the day, but still enjoying the new height and body he now had. Kyle ate and spent a little time with is mom in the living room, then went to his bedroom, getting on his computer by habit, but not browsing for porn as he usually did, maybe later, but he wasn&#39;t ready yet. He gamed for a while and finally at midnight he went to bed, it was the weekend and he would have the entire thing to enjoy his now forever body, he now didn&#39;t even have the thought of getting rid of it, but maybe he could change his mom back to her normal self. Kyle drifted off to sleep and dreamed wet and pleasant dreams, he could figure that out later.</p>
