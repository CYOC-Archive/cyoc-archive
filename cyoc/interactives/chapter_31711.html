<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wearing a bra and panties felt natural enough for Luke that he didn't even think about what he was wearing once he got to school, though when he got there he found himself admiring the girls, not just for their bodies, but for what they were wearing. He found himself wishing that he could wear things like skirts and girl's blouses.<br />
<br />
This got him worrying again that he might be gay, but when he soon realized that if he was gay he would be checking out guys as well, and he had no interest in guys.<br />
<br />
Classes were normal enough, boring enough that he found himself dosing off once or twice during his first two classes. That was typical though, and he had perfected the art of not letting his head hit the desk when he dozed and keeping hand moving over an open notebook so it looked like he was concentrating on taking notes.<br />
<br />
Before going to his third class, a study hall, he stopped to go to the bathroom. Even though all he had to do was pee, he went straight into one of the stalls and sat down. For some reason standing to pee struck him as pointless. While seated he lifted his shirt a little to adjust his bra. As he did so he brushed his hand across his chest and realized that something felt different there. Lifting his shirt for a better look, he looked down into his bra and saw that he had A-cup breasts. Stifling a gasp he dropped his shirt. They were nowhere near filling the cups of the bra he was wearing, but he had breasts.<br />
<br />
In the same corner of his mind that was concerned that he might be gay he knew that he should be worried, frightened even, but he was also excited. He looked at them again and decided that they looked beautiful, so soft and feminine.<br />
<br />
The ringing of the bell telling him that he was late getting to study hall interrupted his thoughts and he quickly finished up in the bathroom and rushed to class.<br />
<br />
In study-hall he tired to get some work done, but he kept thinking about what was happening to him. Maybe he should have been scared, but he couldn't think of why he would be worried.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day, up until his final class passed in a blur. All he could think about was what he would do after school. He wanted to go to the mall and get new clothes, but first he would have to go home and see how much money he had. He would get a whole new wardrobe, the masculine clothes he had now just wouldn't do, all his shirts were loose fitting and would do nothing to show off his breasts. Luke also found himself having to adjust his pants due the way they fell across his hips. It was almost like his hips were getting wider.<br />
<br />
That thought made him smile as well, what would he look like with both breasts and wide, feminine hips? If he wore the right clothing he was sure that he would look almost like a girl.<br />
<br />
When it was time for his final class of the day, he let out a groan. Normally he liked gym, but today it filled him with dread. There was no way he was going to let the guys see he was wearing a bra and panties. If his classmates found out about that and that he was growing breasts he would never hear the end of it. Luckily he was normally enthusiastic enough about the class that when he told the coach that he wasn't feeling well the coach let him sit out without asking any questions.<br />
<br />
Normally he would have stayed out and watched his classmates, but today he decided to go back to the locker room and see if there were any other changes visible.<br />
<br />
Once in there he made sure he was alone and stripped down to his bra and panties to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Now that he was looking, there was no doubt about it, his hips were wider. He walked a few steps while looking in the mirror and saw that he swayed his hips when he walked. Even more exciting, he saw that his breasts had continued to grow, well on their way to being a B-cup. They would be hard to hide, but why would he ever want to hide them?<br />
<br />
He turned in a circle in front of the mirror, admiring how much a girl he looked. The only thing ruining it was his short hair and the unsightly bulge in his panties. Closer examination showed that it might have been slightly smaller, and for the first time he worried about the changes taking place. He didn't want to lose his manhood.<br />
<br />
Pulling down his panties he let a sigh of relief. Everything was normal down there, though most of his pubic hair was gone and his skin was smoother. Luke didn't mind a change like that though.<br />
<br />
Then the bell rang and he rushed to get dressed before his classmates returned.</p>
