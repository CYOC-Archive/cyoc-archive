<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We want to try first.” Neal and Jeffery said in unison.<br />
Neal jumped off the couch and grabbed the nearest pill container, Dan’s pills that Gavin brought, and sat back with his identical twin. The two grabbed 2 pills each and put them in their mouths. They then took turns sculling a bottle of beer each to wash the pills down.<br />
<br />
The room went silent as the group watched the twins carefully.<br />
“Do you feel anything yet? Strange colours or a light feeling?” Gavin asked, not really sure what being high was actually like, only experiencing that sort of thing on TV.<br />
“Ummmm, not really…” Jeffery said before being suddenly interrupted by his brother groaning. The poor guy looked a little pale, sweating a bit and clenched his groin area with his hands. Before Gavin could ask Neal what was happening, Jeff was also looking ill.<br />
<br />
“It’s too hot,” Neal claimed as they both stood up and took off they shirts, their trim naked torsos glistened with sweat under the house lights. Gavin would have found it super hot if he wasn’t so worried about his friends welbellings. Now that they weren’t overheating they looked less ill than before, but still uncomfortable. The group could see now that the twins’ pants seem to be swelling. Not pointy, like they would if they were sporting boners, but more round as if a balloon was inflating in front of they groins.<br />
<br />
Neal couldn’t handle the pressure anymore and pulled down his skinny jeans, leaving him in just his underwear with a large growing bulge. Jeff followed suit soon after. They kept moaning as the bulges grew to the size of baseballs.<br />
“What the hell is happening?” Myles cried out in morbid curiosity. He quickly shuffled over on his knees and yanked down Jeffery’s breifs. To everyone&#39;s shock, two massive testicles fell out as the underwear was pulled down. They hung down to his thighs and were probably the size of two grapefruit, and still growing. Seeing what was happening to his brother, Neal also stripted naked to reveal two grapefruit balls of his own.<br />
<br />
The others were captivated by what was happening and began crowding on their knees around the two naked twins. Both pairs of balls were pulsing as they continued to expand, and above them, the brothers cocks were now starting to harden too. However, to Gavin’s surprise their cocks only grew to they natural erection length, rather than in relative size to their nuts.<br />
<br />
After five minutes, their balls were the size of full size watermelons. Both cocks were throbbing and gushing with precum. <br />
“I can’t handle this anymore. They’re making me too horny!” Neal cried out in both frustration and pleasure before pulling his brother up close to him. With little hesitation the two started fondling each others cock heads, completely ignoring their mates watching. Jeff started to french kiss his brother intensely before moving slowly down his neck till he got to Neal’s left nipple and licked it. The sudden pleasurable tease of his nipple became too much for Neal as he turned Jeffery around and bent him over. <br />
“Sorry Jeffie I just really need to fuck.” He exclaimed as he started pushing his cock into his brother’s ass, using the gushing of precum as lube. The rest of the group couldn’t believe their eyes. They heard rumours that their identical friends were into incest, but assumed that was all typical high school imagination. They certainly never thought the twins would actually confirm the rumors but actually fucking in front of everyone. Still standing, Neal thrust his cock back and forth, deep inside Jeffery, causing him to wailed in pleasure. Their ballooned balls swayed violently between their legs in time to the trusts. <br />
<br />
Gavin wondered if he and Myles should take those pills too. Maybe then they also would be fucking each other. He awkwardly tried to hide the boner growing in his shorts, induced by both his current thoughts and the scene happening in front of him. Though he was not the only one, both Myles and Samuel were also trying to subtly hide theirs, while Phil just let his poke up under his shorts. With a python that size, he had learnt a long time ago that it was impossible to hide, no matter what he tried.<br />
<br />
Neal gave a sudden moan as he began to orgasm, pumping cum straight up Jeff’s ass. Jeff continued to bounce on top of the other’s cock as it gushed tones of cum into his belly. Gavin stared in amazement as the pressure from the amount of cum inside Jeff’s stomach caused it to bulged out like he had just swallowed a basketball.<br />
<br />
However this was not it for Jeff. As soon as Neal shot his final load into his brother and pulled his still hard cock out, Jeff turned around and directed his brother to the floor. Neal lay on his back, legs up, and Jeff knelt between them. He looked a bit ridiculous moving around. Large round belly in front and massive balls weighing him down in the back. He shoved his cock inside Neal and started to fuck him missionary style, with his large belly often in the way. It looked quite firm, and didn&#39;t compress much when it was pressed between the two boys. Gavin also noticed that despite how much cum must of been inside Jeffery right now, very little was dribbling out his ass.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Jeff too began to ejaculate. Pumping a massive amount of cum inside his brother before collapsing next to him on the floor. The two naked boys lay panting on their backs staring at the ceiling. Asses oozing with cum, strained bellies high in the air above them, and their oversized balls resting in between their legs. Gavin reckoned if they were women, the two would look about 5 months pregnant from the size of their bellies. He couldn’t believe that those pills did that to his friends. What was Uncle Andrew and Dan doing with them, clearly some sort of sex thing. Is that why Dan didn&#39;t come out to see him this morning? Did he have giant balls at the time? <br />
By this point the others stopped watching the twins and were looking gobsmacked at each other in amazement of what just happened.</p>
