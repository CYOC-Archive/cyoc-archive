<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Morrison knew one thing about magic and that being from having seen how Jared could change so quickly. As magic tends to supersede all natural physical laws, as Carl was one day, he would awaken to being as Satan, an exceptionally horny, as bedeviling a Devon breed bull by the next morning. It was Satan what awoke and with his returning to being alive, he felt in him the presence and mentality of an intruder. <br />
<br />
Much mooing in the barn alerted Mr. Morrison to his herd-sire bull was alive and feeling alive. As well Jared had spent the night in the barn being Jasper; he having excepted his dual role in life being a horse for his father to earn the family a decent living wage. Bob Morrison was acting as might anyone faced with an easy way to gain wealth, as during the past week he gained again his favorite Appaloosa stallion and stud. As eager friends to Jared told of their fantasy desires, friend Eric became a Shetland pony named Danny. As Danny held a pedigree, his regular use as a stud made money for Mr. Morrison. Three pony mares in need of breeding came along at an appropriate time, as the wild style equine sex worked to enthuse Eric with an idea of him remaining a pony stallion if only to feel the sensuality.<br />
<br />
Bob Morrison was upset early on when his son discovered the power in the silver Medallion, and was transformed, changing into Jasper. The news of Jared having blurted out the fact that he became a stallion on the weekends to two friend, annoyed a father and farm owner. Bob did not want this special tidbit of news voiced around, or the using of Jasper as a stud would fade back to nothingness. <br />
<br />
A bedeviled feeling urged Bob to doom Eric and later, Carl as he was so horny he wanting to know what it felt to be an animal, had accepted the plan to become a Devon breed bull. Bob got a chuckle from seeing Carl being so willing, he being dumb to how the transformation process worked. Scheming, Bob thought then of his regaining three stud-sire animals, damning and dooming then at least two knowing youths to never being able to tell how they became as merged into becoming as animals.<br />
<br />
Devon bull named as Satan awoke and felt the presence of Carl. The animal mentality won easy control over the intruder intelligence; as Carl was willing to discover what it felt like to being an animal, he a bull!<br />
<br />
As Bob Morrison came near the coral where he put a sleepy Carl, it was Satan that had his bold manners of being a hearty bull. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Carl can you hear me, can you understand my words?&quot; Bob Morrison asked the rather nervous acting big red furred bull.<br />
<br />
The bull began to walk in a circle, this a sign he was thinking. As if from the schooled knowledge in the mentality of Carl, the Bullish mind assimilated, merging with Carl as both animal and human became as if one together. A harsh bellowed moo led to another animal having gained enough knowledge as to use his right fore leg and cloven hoof to scrawl some letters in the coral dirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I  HERE,&quot; the bull wrote, &quot;Me W /    SATAN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carl, I wish to speak to you as Satan was but a born and ignorant bull.&quot; Bob Morrison said, but to that the bull mooed loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO  NOT  DUMB  NOW,&quot; the bull scrawled a second time in the coral dirt.<br />
<br />
Bob then took the hay fork from where it usually hung on the barn wall, and he proceeded to fork into the coral a heaped pile of fresh cut hay for the bull to make as his meal. As did the bull begin to forage, munching, acting as if elated at eating like a herbivore. As Bob stood near watching, the bull that was named Satan seemed to be in full control over the bull body. Young Carl was foolish to let the animal mindset gain the controlling of what was his body before it magically became a bull and animal.<br />
<br />
A quick check of his cell phone, and Bob re-dialed the phone number of the man who had need of a loaner bull to breed his herd. &quot;Good morning Mr. Benson, this is Bob Morrison, and my Devon bull named Satan is in the coral and acting as willing to go meet your cows.<br />
Fine, I will load him and drive the brute there, see you about at ten, okay. Say what, how much, ah his leasing cost is $25. per cow, and you do the counting, is that fine with you? Good, see you soon!&quot; <br />
<br />
Bob waited until his new bull ate all the pile of hay served to him, before Bob dared to enter the coral and try to rein the brute. &quot;Carl, come with me,&quot; Bob said, as Satan the bull reacted as passive and willing, maybe because Carl knew the plan of their being leased for herd sire service, and his bullish counterpart played along.<br />
<br />
Bob loaded Satan onto the livestock hauler and drove then the few miles to the Benson farm. The unloading went easy and Satan having smelled the ripe cows, he charged on the run from the trailer, as along a chute to join the cows grazing in the open pasture. As Mr. Benson stood and watched, seeing the hearty big bull go after a cow, Satan sniffing the rump before licking the cow&#39;s vulva, and gaining his erection, the bull mounted his first cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is eager, and that is good,&quot; said Mr. Benson to Bob. &quot;If he does well, would you consider selling him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob did not know what to reply, as this offer would gain him a few thousand dollars cash. The offer was tantalizing,  as unknown to Mr. Benson, but the bull held in him a foolish as curious teenage youth who knew too much, and was for Bob as a danger. No sooner was the question posed that Satan quickly reacted, he turning to look at Bob Morrison with a blank stare of likely a horrified youth realizing his possible doom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me think on that proposition, at least while Satan there does his thing for the next four weeks,&quot; Bob said, as just then Satan the bull fired his first orgasm load of semen inside the hot cunt of a cow.</p>
