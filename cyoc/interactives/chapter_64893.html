<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake finished weeding with Ty perched like a pirate's parrot on his shoulder. <br />
When the chore was done, Jake went inside to wash off. Ty scrambled down <br />
his arm and sat at the edge of the sink. As Jake got undressed to take a <br />
shower, Ty heard Dustin creeping carefully down the hall outside. Jake was <br />
already under the water and wasn't paying any attention to him, so he jumped <br />
off the sink, using his power to break the fall. Ty scurried out into the hallway <br />
and saw Dustin grabbing a snack from the cupboard. <br />
<br />
Ty snickered as he got an idea. Dustin had always been a big eater. He had to <br />
constantly go on short dieting sprees to keep his weight low enough to maintain <br />
his position as quarterback. Ty decided to play some mind games with Dustin. <br />
As Dustin ate the whole bag, which Ty knew he would, each handful of chips <br />
he ate, he would lose some weight. Not enough to make him scrawny, but <br />
enough to be noticeable. Each handful would also make him a better <br />
quarterback. But in reciprocal, each handful would make him feel like doing <br />
something nice for Jake.<br />
<br />
As Dustin strolled back through the livingroom up to the steps with a handful of <br />
chips already in his mouth, he saw Ty staring up at him with a weird animal <br />
grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it bad enough you're in my house?&quot; Dustin asked, miffed. &quot;Don't judge me, <br />
too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin stomped upstairs, confused and angry, which only served to make him <br />
down more handfuls of chips. As he sat down on his bed, he noticed that he <br />
wasn't sinking as far as normal. He shrugged it off and continued to eat. But all <br />
the while, he kept thinking of how he could do stuff for Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I want to do anything for that dweeb?&quot; he wondered. But he <br />
couldn't deny that he wanted to be nice to Jake. &quot;I'll do something small. That <br />
way I'll get this off my chest without really doing anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting up, Dustin went back downstairs to the kitchen. He was glad to see that <br />
Jake's new pet wasn't there. He went over by the basement door and opened <br />
up a box. He turned off the lawn sprinklers that were running. He knew that the <br />
shower didn't get much water pressure while they were running, Jake should <br />
appreciate getting a proper shower. <br />
<br />
'There,' Dustin thought, 'Now I can go back to my room.'<br />
<br />
But once up there, he started eating more chips. As he did, the feeling <br />
returned, stronger this time. He grabbed his head in frustration and ran out his <br />
bedroom door. <br />
<br />
Ty chuckled from behind Dustin's door as he watched him run over to what was <br />
now Jake's room. He began to clean various things, then ran back, ate another <br />
handful of chips, and ran back to clean more. As Dustin ran back in for another <br />
handful of chips, Jake got out of the shower and headed for his room. He was <br />
blocked by Dustin going back with his old Playstation II and a box of games. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Dustin huffed, worn out from rushing back and forth, &quot;You wanted this <br />
last year when I got my new one. Take it!&quot;<br />
<br />
He handed the video games to Jake, ran back into his room and slammed and <br />
locked the door. Meanwhile, Ty had gone over to Jake's room and waited for <br />
the boy on his bed. Jake walked in muttering to himself about what was wrong <br />
with Dustin. He saw Ty, then looked around at his spotless room and the video <br />
games in his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;You did this?&quot; he asked with suspicion. Ty nodded his little otter head. &quot;What <br />
are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didn't think it was just quite the time to tell Jake, so he shook his head <br />
gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;You won't tell me?&quot; Ty gestured again. &quot;Well, I guess you are helping me. You <br />
can stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty rolled his eyes in an &quot;I was going to anyways&quot; expression and hopped off <br />
the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Jake asked him. <br />
<br />
Ty made an awkward shrug with his otter shoulders and walked out. Jake was <br />
curious, but wasn't sure if he should follow the strange creature. He decided he <br />
would stay in his room, that way he could avoid blame for anything the creature <br />
did.<br />
<br />
Ty went downstairs and looked around. The empty bag of chips Dustin had just <br />
ate was laying in the garbage. He heard Dustin in the bathroom, saying <br />
something about his weight. It was while Ty was thinking of his next move that <br />
Mark and June returned. He heard the car doors slamming and headed for <br />
cover. Ducking behind the fridge, Ty waited to see what he could do to his <br />
former foster parents. <br />
<br />
Apparently, Dustin had heard them, too, because he ran into the kitchen with <br />
excitement, cautiously checking all around the kitchen for the mysterious <br />
creature. Ty escaped his notice as he rushed to unlock the door and tell them <br />
about the strange animal. Dustin nearly collided with Mark who was just getting <br />
his keys out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Dustin yelled in a rushed panic, &quot;Jake found this animal in the garden <br />
and it wouldn't get off his glove so he called me to move it and it didn't want to <br />
move and it put pictures in my head and Jake brought it in and it made me do <br />
nice things for Jake and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Whoa! Hold it!&quot; Mark stopped him, &quot;What the hell are you talking about? <br />
Let me get in the door and slow down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin anxiously waited for his parents to get inside and take off their shoes. <br />
June went in to the bathroom while Mark sat down in his recliner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now slowly tell me what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Dustin told him how Jake had found Ty and gotten Dustin to come move <br />
him. He told Mark that Ty had put images of fear and pain into his head and <br />
made him let him in. Then he said how he was eating chips and suddenly he <br />
lost weight and felt like being nice to Jake, giving him his old Playstation and <br />
cleaning his room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake brought an animal into the house!&quot; Mark asked angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're missing the point!&quot; Dustin whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll teach that boy to bring vermin into my house!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gave a mental sigh. Mark had always been a bit slow and never understood <br />
big pictures. If he heard one thing he didn't like, he picked up on that and didn't <br />
listen to anything else. Ty figured he'd better go make sure Jake was alright. <br />
<br />
As he followed a confused Dustin to Jake's room, he heard Mark interrogating <br />
him. Ty rushed in front of Dustin who jumped back with a yelp when he saw the <br />
creature. Just as Mark raised his hand, Ty jumped up his pant leg and crawled <br />
up. It wasn't exactly where Ty wanted to be, but it definitely stopped Mark from <br />
hitting Jake. He jumped around swatting at the moving critter in his pants, <br />
hooping and hollering in disgust and fright. As Mark backed away from Jake, Ty <br />
scampered back out of his pantleg and jumped up onto Jake's bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you did bring an animal into the house!&quot; Mark yelled, obviously disturbed by <br />
the recent incident when his voice cracked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, sir, he followed me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark went to hit Jake again, but Ty changed himself so that he had the large <br />
jaws of a dobhar-chu again and growled at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is that thing?!&quot; Mark yelped, jerking his hand back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know!&quot; Jake tried to defend himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's it, I'm taking care of this thing, now!&quot; Mark roared. He stomped back <br />
downstairs and returned with a broom. &quot;Move, boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake jumped off the bed as Mark swung the broom in a wide arc over his <br />
shoulder like a sledge-hammer. Ty jumped forward and transformed himself <br />
back to his seven foot, upright dobhar-chu form and caught the broom between <br />
his two hands. Mark fell back in fright and Ty snapped the broom over his knee. <br />
<br />
Jake and Dustin stood in awe in a corner of the room. June came to see what <br />
all the noise was about and fainted on seeing Ty's monstrous form hulking in <br />
her foster son's bedroom. Mark cowered on the floor, his mouth agape at the <br />
creature in front of him. Ty altered his voice to sound dark and commanding. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will not harm this boy further,&quot; he said, trying to make himself sound as <br />
godly as possible. &quot;I have watched you abuse this child for the past four years. <br />
He has done nothing wrong, but still you mistreat him and spoil your son. There <br />
are many punishments that I could give you that would be rightly deserved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark collapsed at Ty's feet and began to beg. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do not grovel at me! You know you have wronged the boy. However, I will <br />
show you mercy on one condition: you will treat this child as if he were your <br />
own. If you would not do it to Dustin, do not do it to Jacob. If I should see you <br />
mistreat him again, I will seek a vengeance against you so great that armies <br />
would crumble before it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as for you,&quot; Ty said, turning to Dustin, &quot;You will treat your foster brother <br />
with respect. Do not bully him again. Instead help him and guide him; that is <br />
what older brothers are for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob, if you ever have more trouble with them, simply say my name, Tyk&uuml;, <br />
and I will aid you. I do not want to have to return, am I understood?&quot; Ty asked <br />
Dustin and Mark, who nodded vigorously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then do as I have told you!&quot; Ty ordered while willing himself back to the Order <br />
Space. <br />
<br />
From the portal, he watched Dustin faint as June had, Mark sit there in shock, <br />
and Jake sit down on his bed, completely baffled. Ty didn't think they would <br />
cause any more trouble, but just in case, he would check back later. <br />
<br />
Now that he had gotten his feet wet, Ty wanted to help more people. He moved <br />
around the Earth searching for someone to help. He stopped when he saw...</p>
