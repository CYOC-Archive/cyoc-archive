<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer didn’t feel anything special by seeing her mature mother caressing her girlfriend. Her mother’s and Cindy’s moans at the earliest morning hours felt as natural as birds singing their songs outside. Jennifer considered her own mother as her adoptive mother even if the similar blood run in both of them.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn’t want to bother either her adoptive mother Susan or her other mother Cindy and walked straight to the bus stop. While Jennifer waited for the bus she thought about how funny, or tragic, it was that she had spent most of her life living as an orphan. Her mom had to work as a temporary prostitute as she had to make her ends meet before Jennifer was born, this was her origin story, or this is what Susan told Jennifer when they met each other again. Jennifer met her mother for the first time when was fourteen years old. It was big surprise to both of them when Susan found out that Jennifer was her child. Susan intended to adopt a child but she never knew that she would adopt her own child that she could take care of back then. Susan wanted to make sure that Jennifer receives her second chance at life. It was like a fate’s red string that had made Jennifer, no who&#39;s Jennifer, that wasn’t her name. She wasn’t Jennifer, she was called by a different name. What was going on. How couldn’t she remember her own name. <br />
<br />
“It started with Jay... Jay, no Lay, Lay... Lah, Lah.. no.. was it, Loo.” She tried her best to remember her forgotten name by pronouncing the first letter of her name out loud.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s Luna!” Luna angrily thought when she finally remembered it. <br />
<br />
How could she had forgotten her own freaking name. It was the nice lady at the orphanage how always called her Luna. At first it wasn&#39;t her official documented name but soon it was made official after people at the orphanage referred her with that name. The head mistress of the orphanage explained to Luna that her name was chosen because of the crescent moon that was in the clear sky during the night she was found by the orphanage workers. Luna wondered why she accidentally called herself Jennifer when it wasn&#39;t her name. No one had ever called her with that name. But anyway, back to the point, Luna felt like that the fate had reunited her and her mother Susan together when they met each other that day at the orphanage.<br />
<br />
Luna was surprised to find out that her mother was a hardcore lesbian and had rose from the ashes of poverty and debt like a phoenix. Susan was now a lawyer and worked hard on her cases. But with a work like that Luna’s mother was always stressed out which meant only one thing. When Susan was at her home she sexually open about everything and explained on the first day that Cindy was Susan’s girlfriend. Luna understood right away that lawyer like her was always under a pressure like a chicken inside a steam cooker. Susan used sex to release the build up stress that came from her work. At first it felt awkward and weird when Susan took all her clothes off and went straight to the master bedroom to kiss and have sex with her lover-girlfriend Cindy.<br />
<br />
Luna felt a bit grossed out at first but warmed up on the idea as there was no harm when two adults were having sex with each other even if Cindy was seven years older than Luna. Susan didn’t seem to care at all that Luna saw her mother having sex. Luna would always hear and sometimes see how Cindy would caress Susan gently and vice versa. Luna quickly bonded with her other mother Cindy and they shared a lot of common interests. When Susan felt too tired to have sex with Cindy. Cindy would approach her &#39;daughter&#39; and play video games with her or she would ask Luna to join her to spent time at the mall. Luna liked Cindy a lot and showed her how much she loved her as a sisterly mother. <br />
<br />
After a week had passed Luna wanted to have a talk with Cindy. Luna explained to her younger mother Cindy how she didn&#39;t want to call her mother anymore, but Luna didn’t want to call Cindy by her first name either. So from that day Luna and Cindy agreed that they would call each other ‘sisters.’ Luna loved it when her other mother Cindy would call her playfully as her ‘little brat&#39; or &#39;little goth sister’ when ever they visited the mall. Luna begun to take the role and acted like one in front Cindy. She would playfully smoke a pencil like a cigarette and choose more darker clothing to become a girl that &#39;wasn&#39;t like other girls.&#39; Luna took after Cindy’s fashion sense, with a little modification of her own, and after some time both of their wardrobes looked pretty much the same. Luna&#39;s wardrobe was way darker and filled with more fishnets, hoodies and boots than Cindy&#39;s more bright wardrobe, but in the end, both their fashions shared the same tree trunk even if their branches went into opposite directions.<br />
<br />
From seventh grade onward Luna took her mother’s mantle and awakened her own sexuality towards females. The every day raunchy and loud lesbo sex became every day occurrence and Luna grew used to it fairly quickly. Dildos, loud porn in the background, dirty talk, bdsm, fingering, rimming, pussy licking and every other naughty word and terminology under the red-white-pink lesbian sun became familiar to Luna. When Luna became fifteen years old, Cindy taught to her how to apply the ‘heavier’ make-up properly on to her face and explained in detail what ever item and brush was used for. The heavy make-up suited Luna&#39;s face perfectly and it became part of her make-up routine. Then Luna got her first ear piercings. Luna picked a pair of cute shiny yellow colored crescent moons as her first jewelry that she wanted to wear and that became her second favorite color. Luna’s favorite color was olive green which she used mainly on her hair. The black, green and yellow was a bit odd color combination for her but she liked it.<br />
<br />
On Luna&#39;s seventeenth birthday she received a gift card to Glendale’s hair saloon from her mother and from there, she picked her now iconic hairstyle that she wore daily. The clerk would always ask from her if she wanted to get her nails done and one day she tried it out and loved it. The girl working there looked cute but not the right one for her. Luna wanted to find herself a girlfriend, a special someone who she could smooch and caress, just like her mothers did every morning to themselves. She wanted to be the &quot;Susan&quot; for her own &quot;Cindy&quot;. Luna&#39;s big sister Cindy was always so sweet, so caring and always took care of the Smith family with her supportive and caring nature. Luna couldn&#39;t wait the day when she could kiss her first girlfriend and call her-<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;MISS!&quot;</b><br />
<br />
“Miss? Are you coming in, or are you going stand there all day?” The bus driver yelled gently to Luna which popped Luna&#39;s thought bubble.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry, I must have daydreamed too intensely.” Luna said to the driver and hopped inside the bus which was filled with all sort of student heading towards the same high school building.<br />
<br />
Luna’s eyes wandered all over the bus as she had hard time deciding where she would sit down. Everyone’s faces looked familiar, but oddly unfamiliar at the same time. Something odd was going on. It was like Luna knew everyone in this bus but she couldn&#39;t remember anyone at the same time.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Where would Luna sit down?</h3>
