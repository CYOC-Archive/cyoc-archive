<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen stood their quietly thinking about how to deal with Kyle, she wanted to humiliate him, but also wanted to get rid of him. Kyle and his friends had a tendency to stare at her and the other cheerleaders in the cafeteria during lunch, leering at them and making them uncomfortable, Jen wanted Kyle to be uncomfortable, and then something occurred to her, it was a weird thought, but she decided to test the water first.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kyle, you&#39;re a little perv, what&#39;s that whole fetish thing where a guy gets trapped in a woman&#39;s clothes?”<br />
<br />
“Nininbaori, I think, wait... why?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no reason, and do you like your mom? Like really like her?”<br />
<br />
“What are you getting at?” Kyle shouted.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I&#39;ve got something good for you. For your transformation, you&#39;ll get slightly smaller, down to the nearest foot shorter than you are now, and your mom, will grow a foot taller, unless she&#39;s already much taller. Then your cock is going to grow longer and thicker, enough to please her.” Kyle was about to scream at her in disgust, but she continued. “Now her body will remain the same figure except that height, but since I&#39;ve met your mom and like her, she&#39;ll loose any health problems that she has right now. As for you, after you shrink a little, your relationship will change with your mom. She&#39;ll start considering you like a lover, she&#39;s going to still know and treat you as her son, but also as her boyfriend. You&#39;ll also be considered a clothing accessory, and won&#39;t go anywhere without her man strapped to her under her clothes, she&#39;ll demand that you go with her no matter where she goes. No one will think this is weird, and will treat it as a romantic act of love. The only two people on this earth that will know any different are you and me.”<br />
<br />
Kyle shivered with rage, how could she do this to him. “As for your dare, you&#39;ll never go to school again, since you&#39;ll be ever present with your mom, and you&#39;ll not use the curse to change your new situation. Enjoy your new lover Kyle, and have fun!” Jen hung up, and Kyle stood there still shaking and angry. He then heard his door open, and standing there was his mother, completely naked. His mother was by all definitions, a milf, wide childbearing hips that measured 56”, massive K cup breasts, a moderate amount of pudge on her, she stood in his door way, seemingly frozen in time as he watched his view lower a little, he had stood at 5&#39;4”, but now only five feet, his mom however grew taller, she stood a 6&#39; 2”, he watched as his already taller mother grew even taller, standing stock still, her forehead now hidden by the top of the door frame. He felt his cock grow larger, stiffening until it measured 9” long. Time resumed and she crossed her arms and glared at him.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, stop fooling around and get ready, we have to go to work.” He was about to protest but she started to move toward him. “Fine,” She said smiling. “You wanna play hard to get today love, lets play.” <br />
<br />
The amazon loomed over him and scooped him up, heaving him over her shoulder as Kyle tried to stop her. “Oh my little man, my child, you know you can&#39;t fight me son. Now let&#39;s get ready, Momma has to got to work, and she can&#39;t go without you.” She hauled him into her bedroom, dropped him on the bed and loomed over him, her massive body hovering inches away from him as she pinned him to the bed. She went in for a kiss, giving him tongue, and then stopped. “Kyle, honey. Are you alright? You usually love doing this.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I just um...” He tried to think of something. “I&#39;m not feeling good right now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well your not feverish, so you can still come to work with me, but I&#39;ll stop.” She scooped him into a huge, his face pressed into her breasts. “Now, strip, we need to get ready or we&#39;ll be late.” Kyle hesitated but followed orders, still weirded out by all of this, and finally was standing there naked. His mother grabbed something resembling a cross between lingerie and a one piece swimsuit, before he could react she walked over and slipped the item around him so that his legs were in the right place, and then stepped into the article of clothing herself, he tried not to visibly squirm, but he was screaming inside, she pulled up the lingerie and him with it, putting it on, he felt his erect cock penetrate her pussy.  “Well even if your not feeling well, I&#39;m glad to see mommy turns you on still.” <br />
<br />
Kyle for his part tried to take in what was happening, his virgin cock now buried in his mother&#39;s pussy, his face now smothered in between her massive breasts, she walked over, her body rubbing against him and started to slip on her pants. What little freedom Kyle had to move his legs was taken away as they were pinned against her thighs by the tight business slacks, she grabbed her blouse and put it on then stopped. <br />
<br />
“Kyle.”<br />
<br />
“Yes mom?” <br />
<br />
“Arms please.” Kyle hesitated but finally wrapped his arms around her, “That&#39;s better, and I told you, you can call me Sheila, you are my boyfriend after all.” <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s weird?” Kyle asked, looking up at her from between her breasts, his head cradled between them. <br />
<br />
“No, not really, I mean usually mothers don&#39;t date, let alone fuck their sons, but we have something special, and no one else seems to mind so...” She reached down and pressed his nose with her finger. “My little man gets to be with his mommy.” She continued to button her blouse. “And besides, none of these little whores your age deserve a good man like you.” <br />
<br />
Sheila finished getting ready, Kyle just looked up at her, feeling her naked flesh against him, her pussy wrapping his cock, he wanted to squirm to get free, but was restricted by her tight clothing, he didn&#39;t want this but he had no choice.<br />
<br />
“There, ready for work, now lets get something to eat.” Sheila walked normally with him pinned in her clothes, the movements of her legs against him, the warmth of her flesh was overwhelming, he couldn&#39;t believe this was happening, but he didn&#39;t say anything. His cock however wasn&#39;t able to hold on, the stimulation was too much and he finally cam. “Oh, someone is eager this morning, you usually hold on for a little while longer than that, that&#39;s okay, I know you&#39;ve got plenty.” Wasn&#39;t she concerned about getting pregnant by him. “I&#39;m glad I had my tubes tied, or you&#39;d be the father of your own brother by now.” That explained it.<br />
<br />
Sheila got breakfast ready, he wondered how that would work, and as if to answer, she started feeding him bit by bit as she ate, stopping to give him water out of what seemed like a baby bottle. She payed him little mind as she finished her meal and cleaned the dishes. After she smoked her morning cigarette she got up and grabbed her brief case. <br />
<br />
“Okay honey, time for work.” She said as she patted him on the head, and walked out the door. This was going to be a long and weird life.</p>
