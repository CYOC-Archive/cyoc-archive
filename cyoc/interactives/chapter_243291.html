<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Once again, I gleaned inspiration from WhiteWind&#39;s chapters. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With my little buddy wanting attention, I was about to head to my newly enhanced bed when I heard steps in the hallway. It gave me an idea: perhaps I could change Jake, my hot neighbor. He was a big guy, somewhere in his early 30s if I were to guess. He was a regular at the local gym and would usually come home around this time. I didn’t know what his job was, but it surely didn’t pay well, otherwise he’d live elsewhere. <br />
<br />
I opened the ‘Household’ menu of my HUD and selected the little ” + ” next to my new avatar. A few options appeared, including creating someone out of thin air, creating someone out of 2 parents, and ‘editing existing people’. The window changed to some sort of bird-view of the building, and I could see myself standing halfway between my bathroom and my bedroom. In the hallway, I could see Jake looking through his keychain to select his house key. There were also some neighbors in their apartment and arrows to change floor or have a scaled out view of the neighbourhood. I selected Jake as he closed his apartment door behind him. A window of him appeared, pretty much like it did to me, wearing his current clothes. This time, rather that selecting his outfits or his appearance, my attention focused to the left side, where his informations were. Well, I might’ve just opened the skin option first, to sneak a peek. Damn, was he hot. As I suspected, he was rather athletic. I had to fiddle a bit to find the relationship option. It opened up in a very long list, divided into categories such as “Acquaintances”, “Family”, “Friendship”, “Romantic Partner” and “Woohoo Partners”, with a lot of options in each. The family one included practically any relationship imaginable up to the second or third generation, including step-family and in-laws. I chose the ‘Woohoo Partners’ menu, of course, as it was the matter of importance here, and an exhaustive list unfolded as well, ranging from slitghly attracted and long-term partner to one-night stands.<br />
<br />
I selected the ‘Regular Woohoo Partner’ and a new window opened, of apparently all the people he knew. I ordered them according to their proximity and was thankful to see my face first up. We never exchanged much more than a few words, as we passed each other from afar. So I was relieved to see I was still clocked in. Next to mine and most of the closest names was a single tag : ‘Acquaintance: Neighbor’. As I check-marked the box next to my name, a warning popped up “This change does not comply with Jake Kravets’s woohoo preference settings. Do you wish to continue?” Annoyed, I selected yes, and the window closed. I went back to his main profile and looked under his name where his personality traits, talents and preferences appeared. I selected the last, pretty sure the issue was that he was straight.<br />
<br />
After I looked through the list of genders and checked the ‘Male’ option under “This person is attracted to” and under ”This person is interested in Woohoo with” both, slidebars appeared. I presumed it was related to the Kinsey scale, and left it untouched at 50% as by default.<br />
<br />
Only, there was also a details box next to the Woohoo section, with a red exclamation mark next to it. As I selected it, a window with a wide range of options appeared. The first tab opened on what seemed to be a skillset, including stamina, desired frequency or libido levels. There was also an option for the partners, where monogamy was ticked, next to a red exclamation mark. I unticked it, but didn’t bother selecting another option. Jake will figure it out, I’m sure.  The second tab was called preferences and also had a red icon to it. My gaming instinct told me that’s where the previous error message originated and I opened it. There was a generic section, with stuff like oral, vaginal, anal, all checked, though I suspect it was due to my last change. But there was also an option at the end of the list that was checked, with the same red icon: Abstinent. I unchecked it and looked down through the page. Under this generic section there was a ‘Position Preference: women’ with a few ticked box, including the “exploring” one. Then there was the ‘Position Preference: women’ section, which must’ve been grayed out a moment ago, as the ones beneath are. On top there were boxed for Bottom, Sides, Top, Versatile. With a grin, I checked ‘Bottom’ and ‘Sides’. It sounded hot to have such a piece of man submit to me, though I always considered myself a proud vers. Underneath was an alphabetically ordered list of sexual positions. I only glanced at it, way more interested to discover it by myself than to fidget with it. <br />
<br />
As I went back to Jake’s main profile, I snickered and altered his appearance a bit. First, I enlarged his nipples and darkened them, standing out so much more on his strong chest. After a sigh of relief, seeing there was no censor pixels on his genitalia, I played with his junks in prevision for the rest of my horny plan. It took a moment to find the option to make his dick erect. He was hung, sporting a nice veiny cock that curve upwards, with a rather narrow head, over a pair of low-hanging balls. I enlarged this set as well, amused and horned up to know that his generous endowment will likely never be used to insert himself in another man.<br />
<br />
As I closed the CAS and the HUD resumed to the bird-view, the system asked if I wanted to keep the changes? Yes. To cancel adding someone to the household? Yes again. As he unfroze, I could see Jake adjust his underwear and take out his phone. Moments later, I received a text from him : “You home?” I answered with “wanna cum over?” and followed him through his apartment, dropping his dufflebag in the kitchen before he headed to his nightstand to take out a bottle and what I assumed to be condoms.<br />
<br />
A minute later, the HUD nicely minimized, I opened the door to Jake. Shit, was he tall. He must be about 6&#39;2”, towering over me by about 5&quot;. As he closed the door behind himself, he grinned and dove in for a kiss. “I brought lube. Nice robe.” His large hand grope my ass as he gently pushed me towards the bedroom. He reeked of sweat, but I was into it nevertheless. I guided him to the bed, removing his gym shirt and pushing him to the bed. The lube and condom slipped his hands and met the ground as he hurried to take his shorts off. I grimaced, seeing his unfitting gray boxer briefs, remembering that he was a straight bro after all. I mentally noted to fix his wardrobe later as I flung them above his head, revealing a muscular ass. Jockstraps would be much better on Jake. <br />
<br />
He had just finished helping me remove my clothes when a pop tune started playing from his shorts. “Shit! I forgot Aarav was coming to pick up some stuff today.” I picked up the shorts from the ground, slightly annoyed, and passed them to Jake, ostensibly pressing my hard cock against his groin. Then, my mood changed. “It’s alright, Jake.”</p>
