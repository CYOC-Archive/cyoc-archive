<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monty, a twenty-five-year-old average male with an average build had decided to take up his dad&#39;s offer to use the cabin for some time away from the big city as Monty was feeling a bit overwhelmed by how everything was. Everything in the United States was at such an incredibly fast-paced lifestyle, it was definitely hard to keep up with everyone and everything. Things would change on a moment&#39;s notice. Things that were cool one second would be garbage the next. Things that were garbage would become the hip new trendy thing. It was incredibly daunting and while Monty was a part of that world... he just started to get burned out by all of it. Monty was a guy who was incredibly interested in weight lifting, powerlifting, and strongman competitions while always having wanted a strongman&#39;s build. He thought just the huge muscles, the hairiness, and the overall machismo of that grouping was incredibly endearing for adult men. Hell... the way he was brought up in the 90s while being born in the early 80s, being manly was &quot;supposed&quot; to be how men were. Now... now everything was strange to him and most of it was out of the realm of explanation for him. Monty couldn&#39;t explain it for himself nor anyone who would ask him if he understood what the hell was going on these days. Even with Monty&#39;s wants and desires, he was unable to attain what he wanted the most. It was difficult for him to ever build any sort of muscle, regardless of how often he went to the gym, how hard he worked out, how much he had spent on supplements to help him. Hell... the personal trainers who told Monty what to get were even baffled since they knew that what they recommended always worked on people. Monty was the first to get the short end of the stick. <br />
<br />
As Monty reached the wooded area where he&#39;d have to park and hike the rest of the way, he took in a deep breath with a smile on his face and sighed a bit contentedly. Settling the car in the spot his dad had mentioned to him, Monty couldn&#39;t help but wonder why the single spot? Was it to just conceal the vehicle from prying eyes being kept out of sight from taking a very well hidden entry to the very path he drove his car on? Was it just a personal thing so the vehicle didn&#39;t appear abandoned on the side of the road for some unknown reason? Regardless, Monty turned off the ignition, stepped out of the car as his rugged boot made contact with the fallen dead leaves on the ground with a satisfying *crunch* to it as the weight of his body pushed the leaf to its breaking point. &quot;Man dad... if it wasn&#39;t for you even telling me where the &#39;driveway&#39; was, I would have never found it. It was smart to place two huge bushes there, one on each side, to cover the entrance!&quot; Monty said to no one but himself aloud, closing the door with a bit of a thick sounding thud, then using the key fob Monty locked the doors and started heading along the smaller, but clearly laid out foot path. Reaching around to the back of his head, Monty grinned and chuckled to himself. &quot;... and here&#39;s the path you said would exist that would lead me to the cabin. Though you didn&#39;t say much about what else there would be, you definitely have things planned out well... don&#39;t you dad?&quot; Monty continued speaking out loud to no one but himself.<br />
<br />
As Monty walked the trail, which was nice and cleared out, devoid of a stray tree branch or bush or any other random plant, Monty just took in the smells of the wilderness. At the same time noticing just how peaceful, quiet and serene the place was without the noise that the city was capable of drumming up. While the city definitely had its perks, the wilderness had plenty of its own to share with those who immersed themselves in it. Never thinking of himself to be an outdoorsman of any sort, Monty actually seemed to enjoy the way things were out there where he was. Monty was alone, lost in his solitude, breathing in the fresh and crisp fall air, wondering just where this cabin was in the woods and what he would end up finding there. His dad only told him to take the trail to the end where the cabin would be. His dad also told him that the trek might be a little arduous due to it being a rough trail, but his dad also knew that Monty would be able to handle it since he was a bit of a gym hound. Just thinking of the gym Monty started gritting his teeth, but instantly recognized what he was doing and took a second to get his wits about him. &quot;That was in the past, in the city, what I have left behind to come here and enjoy what is new to my life.&quot; Monty said aloud, increasing his personal confidence, taking a moment to bring clarity to his mind as he kept up on the trail, hoping to come to the cabin soon. However, deep into the forest that he walked, Monty started hearing voices... voices talking about an initiation to the pack. An initiation to the awakening of his werebeast blood... an initiation as a werewolf.<br />
<br />
The word werewolf hung in Monty&#39;s mind, ringing in his ears, replaying over and over in his head as he felt a level of excitement he had only experienced finding that werewolf movie that started his love for the mythological creatures of legend. He thought he was hearing things though, since such creatures weren&#39;t supposed to exist, but his curiosity got the better of him and Monty stopped. He wanted to watch... to see for himself if such creatures existed in reality or if this was some sort of elaborate roleplay. Monty figured that it was just a roleplay, but he would&#39;ve been remiss if he didn&#39;t go look and stay for the fun, regardless of the truth of the situation. However, when he got closer to the bushes and peeked through, he was surprised by what he saw.</p>
