<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By Week 6 you had toeless paws instead of feet. Also your legs had rounded making it hard to walk. Also your privates & butt were completely gone. And you had completely stopped eating & you believe you don&#39;t breathe anymore. You had also lost more weight & height. You lost another foot. When you pressed on any part of your chest you felt soft. You believed you no longer have organs or bones in your chest anymore; just stuffing.<br />
Week 7 you were now fully covered in faux fur. Your human hair was totally gone. You no longer had a bellybutton or nipples & a small round tail on your butt. You didn&#39;t even know about that intill your dad told you about it. Your body was more rounded too. Mobility issues continued as does getting tired physically easily. Your hands have become fingerless and taken on the appearance of mittens in shape. By now you & your parents both agreed you wearing clothes was completely pointless now. So you finally abandoned clothing all together.<br />
Week 8 you now had inhuman plastic eyes now;  but can somehow still see. Though you can&#39;t move them all all as they are now fixed forward permanently. You also no longer have teeth anymore & round ears which are on the top of your head now; but could still hear just fine. Your nose was black plastic now & did nothing at all now; your sense of smell was totally gone now. You now have alot more mobility issues & infact moving wears you out pretty fast. Your parents took you to the doctors to see if there was anything they could do. You rode on your dad&#39;s shoulders sense you were small & light enough to do so. Also because your parents were concerned you might get worn out walking. Moving was becoming very hard & tiring for you now. The doctors weren&#39;t surprised by your nudity at all. One doctor did say &quot;By all your changes we have greatly miscalculated how long you got left.&quot; Your dad put you down on the exclamation table. You sat there with much difficulty. You had to keep yourself with your mitten paw hands. &quot;So... how... much time...&quot; You began to ask. Holding yourself up was tiring you out. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t become totally immobile already.&quot; The doctor said sighing. &quot;I... think...I might soon...Hard...& tiring to...move...or even talk...anymore...&quot; You said tired stating facts. &quot;Before the end of the week you&#39;ll be completely immobile; no longer to ever move or talk ever again. And 2 weeks after that you&#39;ll finish becoming a Teddy Bear.&quot; The doctor informed you. You felt like you were going to pass out. You feared this might be the last time you&#39;ll be mobile & able to talk or even alive as your conscious might go soon so you said &quot;I... might...be... going now ...so...goodbye...&quot; You said & passed out felling forward. Your dad quickly caught your mostly plush body. &quot;Son! Son! You still here!&quot; Your dad yelled freaking out shaking you. But you didn&#39;t respond. <br />
2 things to note here. 1 - Since you lost your eye lids after your eyes became plastic so no one ever knows if you are conscious unless you move or speak. <br />
And 2 - When you sleep you kinda of shut off. You can&#39;t see, hear or feel anything & because of that can&#39;t be woken up by anything. But they didn&#39;t know that.<br />
One doctor said &quot;I think your son might be gone now.&quot; Your mom sure what was going on yelled &quot;No he&#39;s sleeping! He&#39;s worn out!&quot; The doctor sighed &quot;His conscious might have just gone miss. You have to face it.&quot; Both your parents cried. They took you home & laid you on your bed on your back. They left the room. &quot;He&#39;ll be up tomorrow. He just needs to sleep.&quot; Your mom said to your dad sounding like she was now trying to convince herself. Your dad told her &quot;We&#39;ll wait until 8 pm tomorrow. If he isn&#39;t moving & talking by then we&#39;ll know for sure he&#39;s gone.&quot; Your mom cried again. Your mom was holding out hope you weren&#39;t gone yet. As for your dad he was pretty sure you went in the exclamation room on that table. But your consciousness didn&#39;t go as he had thought; and never would.<br />
Author Note: Most everyone was wrong about the consciousness going. Only select government officials knew the truth. They would never lose their consciousness. Infact the government had lied to people about that believing it&#39;s better if everyone believes that the people inflected by the Inanimate Virus ultimately lose their consciousness becoming consciousnessless like all other objects. The government fears people might start freaking out thinking that every object they see or are around might be a consciousness former human. So it&#39;s believed by the general population that the former humans now objects had lost their consciousness making them just like all other objects. And strangely this gives the family and friends of the poor unfortunate person a sense of closure because the family and friends believe that person has more or less died.</p>
