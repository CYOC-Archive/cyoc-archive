<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward Heartpaw surveyed the damage done to his pool table. Noting the deep gouges in the green felt from multiple sets claws digging deep furrows into wood below; Edward knew round three of the sex lottery tuned into a randy affair. His mate Julian, a female anthro cougar fury pulled Bob Clawfoot and anthro grizzly bear fury. The two used one end of the table as an anchor; Bob bending Julian over the table and taking her from behind. Both of their hand paws leaving two sets of gouges and causing two of the pool legs to crack. <br />
<br />
At the other end of the damaged table, resting on the floor was the collapsed pair of furies consisting of Atoli Clawfoot, an anthro bald eagle fury resting on top of Rachael Soulfang; an anthro lioness fury. Both female furies engaged in a duo cunningulus act as they each ate out the other’s entrance. Rachael shouting and screaming for more as Atoli’s sharp beak raked the lioness’s clitoris and nipped her outer lips. Their rolling around on the floor as the licked and sucked each other senseless knock the pool table and caused it to lean towards Bob and Julian. Edward sighed as he needed to get the table fixed.<br />
<br />
Turning to see Michael Proudhoof passed out face down on the floor. The anthro stag-deer fury pulled Edward’s name from the hat and then opted to take in the rear. Edward was all too happy to mount and knot the buck up his anus; he woke up still inside the deer fury and glanced at Michael’s rear end, noticing the fur matted and crusted with his seminal fluids. Both passed out shortly after climax; quicly being lulled to sleep over the passionate moans coming next to them.<br />
<br />
Edward pauses to stare at Lucas Soulfang, an anthro grey furred wolf fury hugging Denise Proudhoof; and anthro tigress fury. The two the last and therefore the final pair, engaged in a muzzle to muzzle rut. Denise already buzzing from her prior orgasms, was already bucking and shuddering when his lupine knot filled her; she came quickly while Lucas, still spent from his prior acts kept thrusting for a good thirty minutes before cumming and passing out in pure exhaustion.<br />
“I guess three rounds is the limit,” Edward chuckling as he quietly heads up the stairs.<br />
<br />
The fox fury was sipping on coffee when Bob Clawfoot first came up from the basement; neither exchanged a word as Edward offered the grizzly bear fury a cup. Accepting the mug, Bob pours himself a cup of coffee and silently sips the hot beverage. Shortly after, Denise arrives as well as Lucas; Atoli, Rachael and Michael soon wake up and enter the kitchen, thanks to the smell of bacon already wafting as Edward fries up half a package worth.<br />
“Eggs to go with the bacon,” Julian speaking to her mate, as takes the bacon to crisp in the oven.<br />
“They’re in the fridge,” Edward motioning to the carton; “who wants fried and who wants scrambled.”<br />
“As long as they are cook,” Rachael answering while dumping sugar in her coffee; “it doesn’t matter how they are made.”<br />
“Extra crunchy eggs for you then,” Edward getting snarky with the lioness fury as the rest of the still sleepy, groan and giggle.”<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
“Ooooh,” Rachael moans while sitting down at the dining table just as Edward was putting scrambled eggs and bacon on the plates; she had to use the washroom and screamed shortly after she sat on the toilet. Everyone stared as she took a few deep breathes before composing herself.<br />
“Your beak is sharp,” Rachael looking at Atoli; “I pissed blood and it hurt to wipe.”<br />
“Well you did scream for more,” Atoli chuckling; “it’s not my fault that my beak is sharper than a Yanagiba.”<br />
“A what,” Lucas looking puzzled as Atoli switched to a Japanese word.<br />
“It’s a sushi knife for making sashimi,” Michael Proudhoof answer as he nibbles on some bacon; “I’d be a poor chef if I didn’t know the primary knife used to make sushi.”<br />
“And now I’m in the mood for some,” Bob rumbling as he finishes his coffee; “you want me to pick some up for dinner tonight Atoli?”<br />
“Just not the octopus,” Atoli tearing through a strip of bacon with her razor sharp beak; “you know Sora doesn’t like that one.”<br />
“I like the octopus,” Bob looking glum as he shovels eggs into his ursine maw.<br />
“And sorry for shredding you down there,” Atoli looking at Rachael; “that rough tongue of yours hit all the right places.”<br />
<br />
The rest of breakfast passed in relative silence as the quietly finished breakfast. Edward and Julian picking up the plates and cutlery for the dishwasher as everyone lingered at the table for a few more minutes. There was a knock on the back door before Alison walked in with an energetic male cougar cub jumping toward his mother and giving her a hug.<br />
“I had pancakes,” Adam squealed as Julian returned the hug before setting her son down.<br />
“Big fluffy ones,” Edward asking; getting his son to turn his head towards him.<br />
“They were small and meat thingies sat on top of them,” Adam beaming.<br />
“Sausage patties,” Alison urging her brother out of the kitchen; “shoo you. I need to talk to mom and dad. Go get your floaties and I’ll take you and Jimmy to the rec center in a bit.<br />
“Pool time,” Adam bounding out of the kitchen; scrambling up the stairs to his room to get ready.<br />
“Mom dad,” Alison pausing as she looks at her parents with a smile; “I’m pregnant.”<br />
<br />
There was a heavy silence in the air before the room erupted in joyous laughter. Michael hearing the news also came into the kitchen to hug Alison before rushing out to hers and Jimmy’s house next door.<br />
“I found out last night before we had our fun,” Alison smiling.<br />
“I kind of knew,” Julian grinning; “the way you avoided your mate’s naughty drink recipe and you were chugging soda’s faster than the cubs.<br />
“Let’s not forget,” Edward smiling; “that you and Jimmy practically holed up inside for nearly the entirety of Jimmy J.R’s camping trip.” Alison’s father smirking as he could at times smell his daughters heat and at times heard their loud bellowing as they climaxed during their wild rutting.<br />
“Well if you put it that way,” Alison about to respond before Adam came bounding back in.<br />
“Can’t find them,” the cougar cub looking sad.<br />
“I know where they are,” Julian taking her son with her to collect the objects.<br />
“Are you hoping for a girl this time,” Edward asking his daughter as he finishes loading the dishwasher; “Twins perhaps?”<br />
“Please don’t say that word,” Alison sitting on the island bar stool; “I don’t want to be jinxed and find out that is what I’m having. Seeing Rachael get big the way she did,” Alison remembering the wolf fury looking gravid before birth; “I don’t want that.”<br />
<br />
Edward laughs as Alison growls at her father while leaving the kitchen; she was immediately assailed with congratulations from the other adult furies that couldn’t help but overhear the cougar fury’s news. Alison could tell that everyone reeked of sex; her feline like nose had no difficulty in picking up the subtle hormones released from orgasming as well as the lingering scents from each fury’s body. Noticing a few had matted and crusted fur around their crotches, she hoped that they would all at least have a quick shower prior to collecting their cub; even going so far as to mention it out loud, getting a few snorts in return.<br />
“At least I didn’t promise Oliver and Paul pudding for later as a bribe to finish breakfast,” Alison snorting back at Lucas and Rachael for their scoffs. “Brittany did,” Alison’s tail twitching as her brother come back from upstairs wearing the plastic floating devices and eager to jump and float in a pool. “Ready to go,” Alison looking at her brother.<br />
“Yep,” the cougar cub answering with a pitiful purr.<br />
“All right,” Alison smiling as she takes Adam’s hand; “let’s go get Jimmy and head to the rec center.”</p>
