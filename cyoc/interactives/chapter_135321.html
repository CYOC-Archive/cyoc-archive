<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus woke up uneasy that morning. He didn&#39;t know why but somethinf felt different. He went to the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror but nothing was different. So, he brushed his teeth and when he looked in the mirror again, she was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeanie!&quot; He said surprised. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just came to tell you I gave you a gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A gift? What kind of gift?&quot; He asked bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could tell you but I prefer to show you.&quot; She took Marcus&#39; left arm and pull it.<br />
<br />
Marcus thought that she would break his arm, but it stretched instead. It stretched a foot longer and then she left it. His arm returned to normal a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I made you rubber!&quot; She smiled. &quot;So you can stretch your body all you want! Isn&#39;t that great?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great? It&#39;s terrible! Why would I want to be rubber?!&quot; He yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of things for sure!&quot; She smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure that you and your friends will come up with a thousand ways to have fun with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you nuts? I won&#39;t tell them!&quot; He replied upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to. I made them know.&quot; She said. &quot;In fact, everybody knows. You&#39;re like a celebrity right now.&quot; Marcus tried to reply but they heard that the other kids were awakening. &quot;I have to go. See you later!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeanie disappeared in the air leaving Marcus alone. He looked at his arm, it looks like usual and even so, it stretched a minute ago. He looked at himself in the mirror. He didn&#39;t look like rubber. Maybe Jeanie just made him a prank. That must be, he thought and left the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marcus.&quot; A boy said. &quot;What are we going to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was planning to go to explore a cave near here.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds boring.&quot; Another boy said. &quot;You&#39;re famous because of your rubber body! What if we play a little with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus was shocked. It was true, everybody knew he was made of rubber. He still frozen for a second, just enough time for his mates to took him by his arms and stretched them around his body. He was trapped by his own arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Marcus yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the news, I watched you taking the shape of a beach ball. Maybe we can play a game!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys threw Marcus to the ground and then they took his legs. They stretched them until they were wrapped around him. Marcus felt immobile and at the mercy of his cabin mates.<br />
He can&#39;t see it but he can feel that they were reshaping his body. Their hands sculpting every inch of his exposed skin. Finally, he felt how a hand pushed his head inside of the blob that was his body until he looked just like a ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the news they didn&#39;t say you were so heavy.&quot; A boy said. &quot;We couldn&#39;t play like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea!&quot; Another boy said. &quot;What if we use him as a boat?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other boys agreed and began to reshape Marcus again. After some minutes, he looked like a raft with his head at the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, guy! We have boats in the lake!&quot; Marcus pleaded. &quot;We can use them instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the boys just ignored him and moved him to the lake. When they were there, they pushed him to the water. Marcus felt the cold water in all his body and he shivered. One by one, the boys mounted him and sailed through the lake.<br />
After a few hours, they became hungry and sailed back to land. They ran to the dining hall, leaving Marcus alone in the lake.<br />
<br />
Marcus wasn&#39;t hungry, maybe because he was more like an object now. So he used that time to reshape back to his human form. It took him more time that he expected but he finally made it after an hour. Then, he realized he was wet and naked, so he ran back to his cabin.<br />
<br />
He closed the door as fast as he entered and began to look for a towel and clothes. He hadn&#39;t noted that someone else was there too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked puzzled until he saw him. &quot;Director Grossman, what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that you were... special.&quot; He said. &quot;And I want to be sure that ot was true.&quot; He slowly moved close to Marcus and whispered to his ear. &quot;My father told me that it was inappropriate to bring some of my toys. That if someone see them it could be a scandal.&quot; He moved his hands through Marcus&#39; body until he met his crotch. &quot;So, I hear about you...&quot; He touched Marcus&#39; dick and began to stretch it. &quot;And your abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus was terrified so he tried to push him apart but his arms deformed in his chest instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know that there are sextoys of you?&quot; He smiled. &quot;I bought mine two years ago but I never expected to be able to play with the real one.&quot;<br />
<br />
He threw Marcus to the ground and tied his arms and legs so he can&#39;t escape. He took off his clothes, exposing his already hard dick to Marcus&#39; face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a little disappointed because although you can stretch your dick so long, it&#39;s still thin like a pencil.&quot; The director said. &quot;But I saw your friends reshaping you to a ball and a raft. So I think I must be creative too.&quot;<br />
<br />
He began to mold Marcus&#39; skin like his cabinmates did in the morning, but he wasn&#39;t looking for a ball or a boat. Marcus felt how he was getting a cylindrical shape with his head at the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better.&quot; The director smiled. &quot;Do you want to look at yourself?&quot; He said and took out a small mirror. Marcus was terrified of what he saw. He looked like a giant dick, a dildo to be more specific. &quot;Now it&#39;s time to go inside!&quot;</p>
