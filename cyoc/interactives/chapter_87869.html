<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casper did some mental math, counting up all the people he had transformed thus far, coming up with 75, including himself.  He and Ashley had a ways to go to get to 500.  Looks like they would be attending a lot of sporting events in the near future.  He went over the list of species that he had transformed people into as well.  Mammals, marsupials, mustelids, felines, canines, equines, vulpines, porcine, bovine, ovine, reptiles and avians have been what he had used in the past.  He wondered if other &#39;cold-blooded&#39; animals, snakes and such were possible.  He knew that aquatic mammals were possible, the orca swim team coach was evidence of that, but he wondered if he could do other aquatic animals like sharks or fish, or even squid and octopi.<br />
<br />
He also thought about how Synthetics reproduced, as he clearly remembered that he and Ashley had both been adopted, but he could not remember from where, or what came before.  He thought about changing his and Ashley&#39;s parents, wondering if their memories would be altered.  He was fairly certain the ring would not let him accidentally erase himself from existence, as he felt the ring&#39;s desire to be used, and if he had never existed, it never would be used.<br />
<br />
Making up his mind, he turned to Ashley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ashley, would you like to meet my parents?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
She looked puzzled, &quot;I&#39;ve met them already...wait, that&#39;s our new memories again, gosh that&#39;s a weird feeling.  I know that I&#39;ve met them, we&#39;ve known each other for years, but for the life of me, I can&#39;t recall what they look like.  Sure, lets go meet &#39;em!&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way across town, Casper delighting in the feel and soft squeak of his latex thighs against each other, and the muted clop clop of his hooves on the pavement.  They came across another police officer, mounted on his horse, and Casper smiled.  Another moment and another rubber anthro sat atop the horse, this one deep navy blue like the husky woman, though this one was male, the word POLICE emblazoned across his back.  He flicked his horse tail, and a small whinny passed his rubbery equine lips, nodding to the pair of them as they crossed the street.  His hooves were tucked into special stirrups on the saddle of the flesh and blood horse under him, and his badge replete with a copy of his barcode hung about his neck.  One rubber hand rested on his duty belt, while the other lightly gripped the reigns.  Like the husky police woman, this shiny horse policeman also had a rubber patch over his nozzle in his stomach.<br />
Casper and Ashley both giggled to themselves at the irony of the new Synthetic.<br />
<br />
A short while later, they walked, or clopped up the steps to a small house, Casper knocking on the door.  The house was well kept, and in a good neighborhood, a white picket fence surrounding the lot.  Casper noted that it almost seemed out of a story, but shook his horned head, dismissing the thought.<br />
An older woman answered the door, smiling brightly as she laid her eyes on Casper.  Not a single hesitation or notice was given to his form as she stepped onto the porch, hugging him tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casper!&quot; she said, &quot;how good to see you again! Its been too long&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled sheepishly, &quot;I know, mom, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter,&quot; his mother said, turning to Ashley.  For a moment there was a flicker of confusion in her eyes, then it vanished, as she stepped forward to hug the lizard girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, good to see you again too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Mrs. Thomas, how have you been?&quot; the lizard girl replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know, things have been things.&quot; Mrs. Thomas said, &quot;but where are my manners, come in, both of you.&quot;  She turned to walk back into the house, and Casper and Ashley stepped in behind her, as she called &quot;Honey, Casper is here, and Ashley is with him!&quot;<br />
<br />
A few moments later, an older man came down the stairs into the living room at the front of the house, smiling as he saw the pair of shiny anthros standing there.  He stepped up and stuck out his hand to Casper, who gripped it with his own latex digits, and the man pulled him into a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you, boy?&quot; Mr. Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been good, actually really good, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down, the both of you,&quot; Mrs. Thomas said, &quot;Let me get you two something to drink and a snack.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair of anthros and Mr. Thomas moved over to the couch, all three of them settling in, Casper and Ashley squeaking slightly as they did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, can you give me a hand?&quot; Mrs. Thomas&#39;s called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Mr. Thomas got up and headed into the kitchen to help his wife.<br />
<br />
Casper took this opportunity, and used the ring yet again.  The sounds of stretching, squeaking latex could be heard, followed by the clop-clop of hooves, as Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, now a red latex ram, and orange latex ewe, respectively, entered the living room again, carrying a tray of glasses of lemonade, a bowl of latex balloons, and a bowl of what looked like cut up plastic packaging from a gadget of some sort.  Like the rest of their kind, just a bulge at his crotch, and breasts on her chest, no nipples, a nozzle for a navel and a barcode on each of their behinds, naked as jaybirds.<br />
<br />
Sitting back down with a squeak, the new pair of rubber creatures found each other&#39;s hands, both tri-fingered like their son&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re so glad that you were able to find other Synthetics,&quot; Mrs. Thomas said, &quot;after we moved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper found that he remembered them moving to this city, but from where, he couldn&#39;t say.<br />
<br />
Ashley spoke up, &quot;I&#39;m glad too, it was nice to find a Synthetic my own age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper and Ashely exchanged knowing looks.<br />
<br />
Casper eyed the &#39;food&#39; on the table, reaching out to take a piece of plastic packaging and a latex balloon.  He brought them up to his muzzle, sniffing them, smelling the strong latex aroma from the balloon and the slightly petrochemical odor from the plastic.  He put the balloon on the plastic, and gingerly placed them on his tongue.  Immediately he tasted the latex, and found that he enjoyed the taste.  He chewed a bit, the plastic &#39;cracker&#39; crunching in his mouth, and he swallowed, and found that he wanted more.<br />
<br />
Ashley helped herself to the plasic crackers and balloon toppings, not wanting to be rude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Mrs. Thomas exclaimed, &quot;I had an idea, let&#39;s call your folks, Ashley, and we&#39;ll all get together for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded, her mouth full of the &#39;hors d&#39;ouvres&#39; and Casper&#39;s mother got up and walked back into the kitchen. They heard the phone come off the hook and a number being dialed.  They heard Mrs. Thomas talking, and a few minutes later, she hung up and came back in, sitting down next to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;They thought it was a great idea, they&#39;ll be here in 15 minutes.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
They passed the time talking about life, Ashley&#39;s job, Casper&#39;s classes, Ashley&#39;s classes, etcetera, until there was another knock on the door.<br />
<br />
Mr. Thomas got up to answer it, and Mr. and Mrs. Simmons came in, human as they day they were born.  Hugs and handshakes were exchanged, and Mrs. Thomas got up, moving to the kitchen, emerging a moment later with another tray, this time with real crackers and cheeses on it.<br />
<br />
Casper looked to Ashley, a question in his eyes and face, she looked at him and nodded.  He nodded in return, and with an effort of will, transformed Mr. and Mrs. Simmons.  They became a pair of rubber anthro lizards, like Ashley, Mrs. Simmons becoming dark blue fading to sky blue on her front and throat, with black spots all over her shiny latex skin, while Mr. Simmons was bright orange, fading to yellow on his front, also with spots.  Each hand was tipped with four fingers, a thick pad at the tip, and they shifted slightly to let their new thick tails flop out to either side of the couch. Nozzles were plainly visible in their stomachs, and Mr. Simmons had an impressive bulge between his legs.  Casper could not see their barcodes, but he knew they were there.<br />
<br />
They had stopped in mid-sentence, but continued once the change was over, saying, &quot;and we were so glad that another Synthetic family moved in, with a child the same age as Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper searched his memories and he could remember meeting Ashley when they were just kids, fond memories of playing tag and hide and seek as children.  He also remembered that he and Ashley had been dating for the last 6 months, even though he knew he only met her yesterday.  His memories continued to show him that he had dated Lana for a short time in high school, even dated a human girl for a short time, but he and Ashley had been seeing each other pretty exclusively for the last half a year.  He knew that he rather liked her, and the thought of starting a family with her didn&#39;t bother him.  He knew it had something to do with their nozzles, but the details were fuzzy, likely that reality hadn&#39;t changed enough to fill in the details.<br />
<br />
About this time, the rubber ewe Mrs. Thomas asked, &quot;So, who&#39;s hungry?&quot;</p>
