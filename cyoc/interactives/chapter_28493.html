<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John felt his ear, it was long and slender. He gasped as he realized he could feel himself touching it. It was a sensation both frightening and mildly erotic at the same time.<br />
<br />
Whatever the effects of that gas was, John was starting to feel it. His skin began to crawl with a sensation that he would liken to ants crawling all over his body, had he known what that felt like.<br />
<br />
John watched as fur began sprouting all over his body. It felt like he was putting on a sweater. John knew that his nudity woulden't be much of an issue for much longer.<br />
<br />
However, John realized that he had another issue to worry about. He saw that the fur growing on his body was white on his chest but -pink- on his legs, arms and sides!<br />
<br />
John's hands went down from his ear as he looked at the attendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on here? Pink is a girl's color!&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
The attendant winked at John. John felt a panic, he didn't want to be a girl! He began to bang on the sides of the machine as claustrophobia he had no idea he had started to overtake him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning, subject's heart rate increasing administering sedative,&quot; the computer voice said.<br />
<br />
A now pink furred John looked back and forth. &quot;Sedative, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
More gas hissed into the machine and John began to feel a lot more relaxed. He stopped banging on the sides of the machine as he felt his muscles relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just enjoy the process. You'll find that you'll enjoy it much more this way. Admit it, a part of you wants this,&quot; The attendant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe just a bit,&quot; John said. While he found himself agreeing with the attendant, another part of him worried that the sedative was leaving him open to suggestion. Although the idea of being a female cartoon rabbit was becomming appealing to John.<br />
<br />
John felt the robotic hands again begin to work on his body. This time there were four of them. Two of them focused on his hips and waist while the other two focused on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; John said. He clasped his mouth as though ashamed of letting an almost moaning sound out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't hide it sweetheart, let you're inhibitions go,&quot; the attendant said.<br />
<br />
John felt something under the hands massaging his chest, it felt so nice. Looking down John saw his chest blossoming into a pair of furry breasts. He wondered how his chest ever looked complete without them. He wanted to touch them.<br />
<br />
Then, John saw his hips and waist. His hips were wider and his waist narrower, giving him a figure that would almost any man drool. John watched the hands do more of their work as they began their work on his manhood. John however was too busy exploring his breasts to care too much.<br />
<br />
Although John knew he wasen't thinking straight, he also felt as though he had little choice in the matter. There didn't seem to be any avenue of escape from this thing. It was going to make him a girl whether he liked it or not. Even if it had used suggestion to make him enjoy it, he again seemed to have little choice in the matter.<br />
<br />
John felt the hands massaging his manhood while also pushing on it. John looked down to see it shrinking. If it wern't for the sedative, he might have freaked out. However, instead he watched with fascination as one of the hands moved and began to move in a circular motion just under his manhood.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the other pair of hands began to massage his throat. John felt something forming under his manhood, he had a feeling of what it was.<br />
<br />
When the hands were done with his throat, they moved onto his face.<br />
<br />
Soon, what was between John's legs was not at all familiar, at least in the sense of what he expected to have on his body. He coulden't help but look. He gasped in a voice that was now female at the sight of a body not recognizable as anything but a female humanoid rabbits.<br />
<br />
John felt the gloves pinching and twisting his face. It wasen't long before he, now she had buck teeth and blunt muzzle.<br />
<br />
The final phase came when the hands made their way down to John's shoes. John watched as they pulled the shoes, stretching them and from what John felt, her feet as well.<br />
<br />
Then, the hands retracted the the booth opened. John staggered out, dropping the jumpsuit. The attendant caught John, who looked up into the attendants eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;There now honey, that wasen't so hard was it?&quot; The attendant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I'm ... I'm a girl!&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you are shug. Doesen't it feel great?&quot;<br />
<br />
John managed to stand up as the sedative wore off. She again looked at her body. She was naked, yet her fur gave her more then enough protection. She had a gorgeous figure. On a different world, being another species and gender didn't seem that abnormal. John knew that she could explore being female without the worry of her friends and family back home judging her. Even if they went to this world, they, after all, would have no idea it was her.<br />
<br />
Hearing another door opening behind her, John turned to see Carrie stepping out of her chamber.</p>
