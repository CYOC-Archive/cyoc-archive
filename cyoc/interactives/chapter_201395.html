<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah, um,&quot; Eric hesitated for a moment, considering how much he should reveal, but then he decided there was no harm in giving the full story to his brother. He took the ring from Ethan&#39;s fingers, where it was being offered, and squeezed it carefully in his right fist as he spoke. &quot;My school is closer than yours to the mall where you lost it, and I figured maybe this kid goes there. So on Friday I just watched the boys around my age who might be like the one you met. I mean,&quot; he shrugged nonchalantly, &quot;I knew what to look for, because I know what it&#39;s like to carry around something that size and have to hide it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure do, better than anyone. You&#39;re the expert on it by now.&quot; Ethan ruffled his hair. &quot;Though I&#39;m not so sure you&#39;re that interested in hiding it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric giggled, and he flushed red. It gave him butterflies hearing Ethan call him that, like he was *the* specialist on this subject, and though his brother was joking, there was some truth there and they both knew it. Hearing it acknowledged made him feel good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I found that boy, made friends with him over the weekend,&quot; Eric continued, &quot;and I just got back from his house! You were right, he is kinda shy and he&#39;s small like me, but I wanted to hang out with him anyways, so we played some games for a bit. His name is Brandon Montgomery, he&#39;s 10, and I think-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec, Montgomery?&quot; Ethan blinked. That surname was familiar. &quot;Does he have an older brother named Jared?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; It was Eric&#39;s turn to be surprised. &quot;I met him, and he was kind of a butthole. How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jared goes to Belmont, and is on the swim team too. Remember a couple of weeks ago you had that soccer competition at school, where you stayed big for most of the day? After practice, he must have seen me in the showers, and he snuck a pic of me with our little cock. I guess he&#39;s always been jealous, but he tried to spread that pic around and ruin my reputation. Luckily, you swapped us back when your competition finished, just in time for me to flash a bunch of girls and make him look like a liar, so they deleted all the copies of the image.&quot; <br />
<br />
Except for the one that he still had, but Ethan wasn&#39;t about to tell anybody about that, not even his little brother. He kept that lone remaining copy safely stashed in a secret folder, where only he could access it.<br />
<br />
It was for special private viewing only.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, he is definitely an asshole.&quot; Ethan shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t like him for trying to pull that shit, but I haven&#39;t thought about it since then either, since he failed and it got him nowhere. Kind of ironic that Brandon is his brother though, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
While it didn&#39;t seem to bother the older brother, this news had a far different effect on Eric. Not only was Jared probably bullying his own younger sibling -- Brandon&#39;s reactions had made that clear to him -- but he had tried to defame Ethan ... by doing THAT?! It was a horrible way to treat somebody, and knowing that Jared had tried to use that image so maliciously was another thing altogether for Eric. Ethan was usually easygoing and able to shrug off problems, and it was part of what made him so popular at school. He didn&#39;t tend to hang onto grudges as much as some people did, and he generally forgave transgressions, or at least just let the past go.<br />
<br />
For Eric though, this was too much.<br />
<br />
Finding out more about Jared made him mad.<br />
<br />
More than mad -- he was spectacularly angry.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s moral lesson about responsibility was one that both brothers had learned through recent embarrassing mistakes, but it had instilled in Eric a certain sense of justice. He already had a good sense of right or wrong, but now it was exaggerated and moved up a notch. He felt like his redemption wasn&#39;t going to be complete until he helped Brandon too.<br />
<br />
Right then and there, he made a private vow: he had the ring back -- but he wasn&#39;t going to swap himself again until Jared had learned a lesson about treating others properly. Being big would be his ultimate reward for doing the right thing, and it would be all the sweeter at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Ethan.&quot; Eric took a deep breath. &quot;So, uh, I do want to swap us again, but, um, I think we shouldn&#39;t for a few days. I mean, I really really want to do it, it&#39;s so much fun -- and I know you want it too?&quot; There was a momentary pause before the older brother nodded sheepishly to the statement, his face reddening, but he didn&#39;t try to deny it. Then Eric went on. &quot;But maybe we should both just choose to go without? After all, we made these mistakes because we couldn&#39;t control ourselves; me with the dogs, and you at the cinema. I think it&#39;ll be good for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? You&#39;re right.&quot; Swallowing what was left of his pride, Ethan agreed. His little brother was correct: he DID want to swap again straight away, this time with the real deal -- their little cock -- but it was that stupid itch that created the problem in the first place by making him crave it. He had to learn to handle those urges better than how he had during the date with Lucas. He HAD to learn to control it and be strong enough to deal with it. &quot;Practicing some self restraint will be healthy. That&#39;s a smart idea, and since the ring is yours again, it&#39;s up to you. I trust you to make a fair call about when to swap us next.&quot; He ruffled Eric&#39;s hair a second time. &quot;You make me proud, little bro. I know a few adults who could learn something about maturity from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Ethan.&quot; Eric smiled. &quot;That means a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It took a little while for Eric to figure out how to approach his new mission. He had a few potential ideas, but none of them seemed to make too much sense. Those ideas were either too hard to put into practice, or just overly difficult to organise. He needed something with punch to it, something that Jared wouldn&#39;t forget, but that he could make happen without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Then, he remembered a phrase Brandon had said when he still had Ethan&#39;s cock. Brandon had mentioned -- repeatedly -- how it was too big and he wanted it smaller, though once he had also added: &#39;but not all the way small&#39;.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, Eric reasoned, something closer to what his older brother might have?<br />
<br />
What if ... the Montgomery siblings were to experience their *own* magical mysterious swap?<br />
<br />
Temporarily, of course, but for long enough to scare Jared into being a better person.<br />
<br />
The more Eric thought about it, the more he liked the ring as a means to teach a lesson. The concept of using fear against a bully was very appealing, though there was a hitch. Through some carefully-worded questions with an unknowing Brandon, Eric discovered that the older brother was very fastidious with his possessions, and this included his clothing. Brandon himself wouldn&#39;t be much help getting something from Jared, because he was too afraid of the consequences of being caught. Acquiring anything was going to be a challenge, and Eric was short on ideas. That was, until Brandon again mentioned something else useful. Apparently, at home, Jared was quite vocal in his bitching whenever he was upstaged in the pool by others on the swim team. The most common name that came up as an object of scorn was Ethan -- hardly surprising to Eric, who pridefully agreed that his brother WAS the best -- as the largest metaphorical thorn in Jared&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
However, another person got frequent mentions too.<br />
<br />
Borrowing his brother&#39;s phone later that evening when Ethan wasn&#39;t paying attention, Eric copied that person&#39;s number to his own cell, and then in the privacy of his room, rang it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; A familiar voice was on the other end. &quot;Who&#39;s calling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Greg.&quot; Eric greeted him. &quot;It&#39;s me, Eric. Ethan&#39;s brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey little dude! Or is that big guy?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting a call from you out of nowhere. What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, you know Jared, right? From your swim team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Montgomery?&quot; Eric could almost hear Greg rolling his eyes through the phone, and the irritation was stark. &quot;Sure do. He&#39;s got a problem with everyone above him on the rankings, and takes it super personally. Mostly your big bro, since he&#39;s usually at the top, but also me, sometimes Nate as well, and also Lucas recently too. Talks a lot of crap behind our backs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, thought Eric, that sounded like him!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The younger Morales agreed. &quot;Ethan told me what he did. You know, that picture he tried to spread?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I heard about that. Felt kinda bad about it too. He only got that pic because me and Ethan were messing about in the showers, so it was partially my fault. Your bro and I might be competitors, but I&#39;m not trying to mess with him on purpose that badly, you know? Not to hurt him socially or anything serious like THAT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, did you know he also bullies his younger brother? Like ... not playing around, but ... actually bullies him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; He sounded surprised. &quot;Where are you going with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I know Brandon because he&#39;s at MY school, and I&#39;ve seen how scared he is, and I&#39;ve heard some of the stuff Jared does.&quot; He took a deep breath and popped the question. &quot;The reason I ask is ... do you want to help me teach Jared a lesson, using the ring? I can&#39;t tell Ethan I&#39;m doing this, but I was hoping you might be willing.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a healthy pause, before Greg replied. &quot;Now this is a turn in the conversation I was NOT expecting! I&#39;m definitely in!&quot; His tone immediately went devious, and he shifted to planning mode, needing no convincing to join Eric&#39;s conspiracy. &quot;We want to swap him in some embarrassing way, right? That means you need his clothing, and I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why you&#39;re asking me for help, since me and Montgomery are on the team together. Hmmmm.&quot; He hummed, thoughtful. &quot;He&#39;s kinda careful with his gear at school. Even after practice, he&#39;s either got it stashed out of sight, or he&#39;s first back getting changed. In order to get anything, we&#39;d need to be like super ninja stealthy, or ... create a distraction at the right time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of distraction?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question. If I think about it,&quot; Greg mused, &quot;there&#39;s only one other thing that really interests him outside of making himself look good in the pool, and being popular, and that&#39;s ... girls. He loves chasing the tail, even if he strikes out most of the time. So, little dude, here&#39;s an idea! I&#39;ve got somebody else in mind to join us, if you&#39;re okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody else? Who is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone that Jared will fall over himself to talk to,&quot; Greg laughed, &quot;and she&#39;ll be happy to help us do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It was late during the Tuesday swim practice that the first part of the operation was put into practice. All it had taken was some secret adjustment of the coach&#39;s schedule -- moving a certain student to the end of the list so he was last in and out of the pool, adding a couple of extra laps to keep him in longer, and then orchestrating a call from the school&#39;s admin office to keep the coach busy for a few minutes. Her aunt, who ran said admin office, hadn&#39;t been thrilled about being involved in the &#39;harmless prank&#39; they were undertaking, but the request was reluctantly agreed to without question. A favour was owed from a lost bet during last Thanksgiving, and that favour was now being called in.<br />
<br />
The timing was near perfect. Jared was entering the boys changing rooms just as the last students were emerging and leaving the pool enclosure. With a wink to Greg, who was leaning inconspicuously on the railing a couple of rows up the stands while he waited, Haylee adjusted her cleavage and slipped into the changing room after him.<br />
<br />
He looked up as she was walking across the damp concrete to him, next to his bag and gear near the corner of the room. On seeing her he froze as he was -- shirtless, still in his speedos, towel around his shoulders, each half dangling over either side of his chest like a priest&#39;s stole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haylee?&quot; Surprised to see a girl in the boy&#39;s room, he tried to question her. &quot;Why are you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, nobody else is around.&quot; Haylee sauntered past him, giving a light swing of the hips, knowing full well what signals her body language was sending. She&#39;d switched out of her more comfortable lifeguard crop top and pants into a skirt and string bikini top, just to amplify the sex appeal. Stopping on the other side of him, almost close enough to touch, his eyes followed her every step of the way. &quot;You managed some good times today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah.&quot; He took in a breath, his nerves vanishing, and then that same cockiness returned. &quot;I&#39;m the best. Coach just has his pets, and he takes care of them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know he does,&quot; she lied, repressing the urge to laugh out loud at the idea of the notoriously even-handed swim coach playing favourites, and doubly so knowing that there were at least three, sometimes four other boys who were consistently faster. &quot;It&#39;s a real shame you aren&#39;t being recognised.&quot; She reached out with her left hand and casually gripped that same half of the towel. &quot;You deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The actual shame, Haylee believed, was that he was such a fucking douche.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Jared wasn&#39;t terrible looks-wise. Dark hair, clean skin. Decent fashion sense, above average appearance. <br />
<br />
Not bad ... but why would anybody want *that* when there were guys out there who were not only better looking, but also genuine sweethearts too?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jared&#39;s eyes drifted to her hand, and his lips twisted into a slight smirk, as if he figured out why she was there. &quot;I definitely do.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the other end of the changing rooms, over Jared&#39;s shoulder, Haylee glimpsed Greg poking his head around the entryway divider and looking in their direction.<br />
<br />
That was her cue.<br />
<br />
She grasped the other half of the towel in her right hand, and began to back up, slow but steady, forcing him to move like it was a halter. The rear wall was less than ten feet behind her, and she bumped against it, Jared pulled along with her, an obedient puppy on a leash. He was playing it really cool, but she could practically smell how excited he was on the inside. For all the boastfulness, a guy like him wouldn&#39;t normally get this close to a girl like her, and she knew that.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t even really ego on her part -- she didn&#39;t care that much about the stupid social hierarchy of high school and the attached perceptions -- but she understood the effect it had on people who DID care, and Jared had definitely bought into that stuff.<br />
<br />
Once again, she glanced over Jared&#39;s shoulder, and saw Greg sneaking barefoot along the room to the unattended gear.<br />
<br />
Great!<br />
<br />
Time to win an Oscar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabby wasn&#39;t fair to you.&quot; Haylee purred, and she tugged him close against her using the fabric lapels of the towel, before dropping her hands to his hips. &quot;Let me make it up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled him in, and their lips met. His were cold and tasted of pool water, and it took only three seconds before he was trying for more, pressing in even closer, attempting to use tongue and assert himself like the ladies man she knew he imagined himself as. She&#39;d been with more than one guy who acted exactly that way though, and she wasn&#39;t about to let him set the tone nor control her, so she slid a hand around and squeezed his ass ... HARD.<br />
<br />
Jared jolted in shock, but he cooled it immediately, accepting the reprimand. A moment later though -- even as she allowed the kissing to resume, but tamer -- she felt a hardness, lower down, against her body. <br />
<br />
Was that ... an erection? Just from being put in his place?<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s definitely no Ethan,&quot; she thought, &quot;and maybe that&#39;s why he was such a bitch about the shower pic?&quot; Painfully average was the impression she got from what was jabbing into her thigh. &quot;Ugh. Just pretend it&#39;s stud-boy and that perfect monster cock instead, and I&#39;ll get through this. Lucas is a lucky guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cracking an eye open, she caught a momentary image of Greg silently and hastily rummaging through Jared&#39;s bag.<br />
<br />
Hurry it up! Just take whatever you need!<br />
<br />
Abruptly, Jared broke off their kiss, and started to turn his head, having caught a hint of noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you hear someth-&quot;<br />
<br />
Lightning fast, Haylee jerked a hand around, jamming it between them to grab his crotch. Like whiplash, his attention snapped back onto her, the disturbance forgotten, and she clicked her tongue sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eyes on me, Casanova. We&#39;re alone.&quot; Not wanting to lose momentum, with the free hand she reached up behind her neck, and with an expert tweak, pulled at the loosely-tied string, readied for easy removal ahead of time. In one fluid movement, her arm reversed direction, and plucked the bikini cups forward so they hung down, freeing her breasts to greet the open air.<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s mouth dropped open, unable to even pretend that his faux-suave facade was real anymore, and he simply stared.<br />
<br />
Too easy.<br />
<br />
She squeezed his cock, and it stiffened further to all-the-way hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Arching her back just a fraction, she felt her &#39;girls&#39; jiggle slightly as she showcased them. She had a killer pair, and she knew it; big enough to attract frequent male attention, but not so much as to be uncomfortable, nor obscene. Round, perky, and soft, they were the secret weapon that kept Jared&#39;s gaze fixed on her chest, even as her own eyes flicked across to glimpse Greg rapidly tiptoeing back along the concrete, something clutched in his hand, before he was heading out the entryway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Jared murmured, transfixed. His arm rose, wanting to touch. &quot;Can I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; She smiled sweetly, simultaneously letting go of his crotch with the busy hand and intercepting his wrist in a firm counter with the free one. The party was over, and she didn&#39;t need to keep the charade going. &quot;Don&#39;t know what kind of girl you think I am, but ... look where we are. I&#39;m not doing anything in a pool changing shed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... uh,&quot; he looked confused, then irritated, then hopeful, his expression morphing rapidly as he tried to figure out where this was going, and how to net the most out of the baffling provocative contradictory behaviour from a beautiful girl who would normally be out of his league. &quot;Maybe we can go-&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee pushed him gently away from her, a hand on his chest, interrupting him yet again. &quot;If you want to sample this, it&#39;ll have to be somewhere more comfortable.&quot; With practiced deftness, she raised the bikini top back into place, adjusting the cups over her boobs. She lifted and refastened the string behind her neck, and gave a little shimmy of the shoulders, working them into a comfortable position. &quot;Would you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; He had remastered his brash attitude, and was doing his best to recover and bolster his projected image. &quot;Shall I give you my number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ll find you,&quot; she said, &quot;but only if you keep this between us. A word to anyone, and nothing will ever happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Haylee sidled around and past him, her hand brushing his shoulder teasingly, flashing him a wink as she went. He watched her go, her feet tapping on the concrete in a confident feminine strut that made him stare in horny disbelief and fruitless wonder.<br />
<br />
What the hell had just happened?<br />
<br />
Outside, Greg was waiting for her, the only other student in the pool enclosure, with the coach still occupied on call. He gave a big thumbs up, briefly holding Jared&#39;s spare speedo in the air so she could see it, before he stuffed it securely inside his school bag. Then he strolled off, to the pool exit, nonchalant.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much for Eric to finalise the time and place, and set it all up.<br />
<br />
First was a little white lie to Brandon about Eric&#39;s &#39;magic playing up&#39;. He warned the younger boy that he shouldn&#39;t worry about this ... BUT ... he might see a temporary bit of growth &#39;down there&#39; again, at &#39;some point on Wednesday, probably&#39;. It would just be for a short while, but that was all! Nothing to be concerned over. Brandon did ask if it would be &#39;as big as before&#39;, to which Eric had to giggle. No, it definitely wouldn&#39;t be THAT big. Just a regular size, he made sure to assure the younger Montgomery brother.<br />
<br />
Maybe Brandon would even enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Eric didn&#39;t want to scare him with too much information.<br />
<br />
The second thing was making an excuse to Ethan about where he&#39;d be on Wednesday afternoon. He made up a story about needing to work on a project with a classmate, so his brother wouldn&#39;t need to pick him up. Greg would come get him right after school finished, ditching his final period so they could both make it to the pool where their target would be practicing. While he didn&#39;t think Jared was going to beat up a kid out of anger, he knew for sure that nothing could happen with Greg around -- and Greg had made it crystal clear he WANTED to be there.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to only hear about it, he wanted to see it happen to Jared, and be able to rub it in at the same time.<br />
<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t disagree that he liked the idea.<br />
<br />
With all that in mind, the only thing left was to wait for the following day to arrive.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Finishing up the last of a couple of extra laps assigned to him -- Jared wasn&#39;t sure why he&#39;d been given additional practice the last couple days, the coach had seemed overall happy with his performance -- he swam over to the side of the pool. Didn&#39;t matter too much though, he considered. Things had been on the up recently, especially since the previous day. Who knew Haylee was actually interested? She always seemed to have her eyes on Ethan.<br />
 <br />
Fucking Ethan! What was so great about that prick anyways? He acted like nothing bothered him, everyone fell over themselves to be his friend, and for some reason the girls just drooled when he walked by. Jared knew the truth, Morales was a fucking fraud -- he&#39;d seen it that day in the showers! He didn&#39;t know HOW it happened, but Ethan had made him look like a liar in front of Gabby and the other cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
Whatever. He was sure he could get a date with Haylee, and hopefully a lot further. She was obviously into him, and she had a sweet pair of tits.<br />
<br />
Definitely a hot piece of ass that he intended to nail.<br />
<br />
Those happy thoughts were circulating through his brain as he climbed out of the pool, dripping water, and not five seconds after, he felt a strange sensation.<br />
<br />
It was a weird pulling motion, like a part of his body was being drawn inwards -- and it was centred on his groin.<br />
<br />
What was that?<br />
<br />
Looking down, he could see his speedo slackening, like something had been removed from inside it, and he could feel the material on his skin underneath as if it was much more sensitive.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
Standing still at the pool&#39;s edge, he cautiously stretched the speedo&#39;s waistband out and peered down, concerned.<br />
<br />
Instead of the sight he was familiar with, and quite proud of, there was something quite different. His penis was shrunken, maybe a couple of inches long and far thinner. His balls were even smaller, like a late-blooming middle schooler, and his pubes were gone, the fabric against his hairless skin causing a sense of panic that was hard to fathom.<br />
<br />
Letting go, it snapped back into place, and his eyes were drawn to his reflection in the pool water, and the image made him take in a breath of pure horror.<br />
<br />
The much looser speedo outlined a bump that was barely enough to distinguish him from a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having problems, Montgomery?&quot; A voice drifted over to him, and Jared jolted in surprise to see who it was, not expecting anybody else to still be there. It was Greg, a score of paces along the concrete, with a younger kid -- one who seemed vaguely familiar -- dressed in jeans, a shirt, and a cloth cap. His eyes went deliberately and pointedly down to Jared&#39;s crotch, before he commented. &quot;You aren&#39;t looking so hot there, pal.&quot;<br />
<br />
What the hell?<br />
<br />
Was this some kind of setup?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck YOU, Greg!&quot; It was hard to contain his anger. &quot;What the hell kind of bullshit is this? You wanna explain what you did, asshole?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I did anything? I mean, shrinkage can be explained by water temperature, so maybe it&#39;s just cold. Really really cold.&quot; He snickered. &quot;Though, you&#39;d need, like, arctic levels to cause ... that.&quot; He smirked, and before Jared could say anything, turned to the kid. &quot;What ya reckon, Eric? Should we tell him that we magically swapped his cock for a smaller one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess he should know.&quot; Eric shrugged. &quot;The real question is: how long should we leave him with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric? Why did the kid look so familiar? The way this smug little brat was staring at him was definitely getting under his skin, and Jared knew he&#39;d seen him somewhere before, and in a burst of realisation it hit him. Eric looked like ... Ethan. A much younger version, but he had to be a Morales -- Ethan&#39;s little brother? Immediately Jared understood, and with a heart-thumping burst of fear, the pieces came together.<br />
<br />
The shower pic of a tiny cock, and then later ... it wasn&#39;t, not when Gabby and her friends saw it. The size changing had never made sense then, but in the current context, it did, and now?<br />
<br />
Now, it was his turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few days? A couple weeks?&quot; Greg mused. &quot;Maybe he should be on the junior team instead. Win more races too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric gave a boyish giggle. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true. A lot less slowing him down, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, and smooth as a baby&#39;s butt. He&#39;d fit right in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Red-faced, Jared could only listen to their banter and try desperately to ignore the way his speedo brushed against his disturbingly clean little crotch. Days? Weeks?! He couldn&#39;t do that -- they wouldn&#39;t ... would they?<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I didn&#39;t fucking do anything to you, okay?&quot; Fists clenched, he reined in his anger, still trying to brush off the weird physical tingles coming from below. &quot;What&#39;s your problem? I&#39;m not hurting anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid&#39;s eyes narrowed at that remark, and he frowned, not seeming to believe it. &quot;Should we make it like ... a month?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A month.&quot; Greg seemed to think it over. &quot;Could do him good. None of that adult stuff getting in the way, like hardons, interest in girls, so on. Give him plenty of time to focus on the pool and showing off his ... assets.&quot;<br />
<br />
A month?!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I-&quot; he tried to reason, but his nerves gave out. &quot;Please. Whatever you did, just change me back.&quot; He shivered, the cool air and the thought of being marooned with a little cock for that long making his chest tight and muscles even more tense than they were. His tone changed, becoming less reasonable and more whiny. &quot;I- ... I won&#39;t mess with your brother again. Isn&#39;t that what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just that.&quot; The sternness in Eric&#39;s words was surprising, and his glare steely. &quot;You aren&#39;t gonna be a weasel to anyone anymore. You&#39;re gonna be nicer to people, specially your brother. Leave him alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon.<br />
<br />
Did he have something to do with this?<br />
<br />
The fear was too much to dwell on that thought though, and he couldn&#39;t bear the idea of being forced to stay like this for ... a month.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... p-promise.&quot; Jared spat out the answer, his lips trembling, the words the biggest ego gut-punch he&#39;d ever known. &quot;I&#39;ll be ... ... &#39;better&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg whipped his phone out of his pocket, and held it up thoughtfully. &quot;Hmm, if I was a real douchebag, I would take a picture of you like this. Great angle, hi def, perfect outline of you ... not packing anything much, to be honest.&quot; Jared&#39;s heartbeat picked up even more, his mouth dry with the dread that the simple notion of a cellphone camera caused. No! Nobody could see this, there was no way-<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to be a genuine bonafide card-carrying jerkwad to share an image of somebody without their permission. Lucky for you, I&#39;m not like that.&quot; He grinned, stowed the phone, and put a hand on Eric&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Come on bud, let&#39;s make tracks. We&#39;re done here.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Eric pointed to his eyes, with the double-fingered V, then directly to Jared; the universal &#39;I&#39;m watching you&#39; gesture, with his stare containing an uncomfortable amount of veiled menace for a boy his age and size. Finally the pair turned and strolled away towards the pool enclosure&#39;s exit.<br />
<br />
Before he could call out and ask, fully prepared to beg if he had to, the reverse happened.<br />
<br />
The sensation was just as alien as the first time, except the opposite. There was the push of flesh, and the bizarre swelling made him take a big gulp of air out of sheer relief. He looked back down to his speedo, and the sight of it once again comfortably filled out was like the Hallelujah chorus playing in glorious stereo.<br />
<br />
What in the FUCK kind of crazy had just happened?<br />
<br />
Jared tried to calm himself down as he plodded across to his towel, but beneath it all, despite what he had just agreed to, there was an undercurrent that wouldn&#39;t, and couldn&#39;t go away.<br />
<br />
He was still ... furious.<br />
<br />
What if this supernatural weird bullshit had gone on for weeks like they said -- ruined his reputation, spoiled his chance with Haylee?<br />
<br />
The most stand-out thing, however, was his little brother.<br />
<br />
He had something to do with this.<br />
<br />
Jared wasn&#39;t sure what that pathetic little wimp thought he could accomplish by involving himself, but he was very certain of one thing.<br />
<br />
Brandon was going to learn about how unpleasant consequences could be.</p>
