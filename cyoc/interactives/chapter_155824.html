<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something even I forget sometimes is that once a wish is spoken, everything about that wish must come true. Sometimes I get too caught up in making the grammar work to think about the ramifications, but why would I care anyway? I’m a fucking genie. Anyway, remember when I changed Jack’s wish to say &quot;I wish you&#39;re weren&#39;t the ONLY HAIRY DOM top of your class?” Well, that implied there were others. The thing is, there weren’t any other hairy dom tops in Ken’s class… Until now, that is.<br />
<br />

<br />
EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON<br />
<br />
Miguel sat down in the library’s private study room, waiting for his partner Robert to show up. Honestly, he wasn’t sure why he bothered. Robert was a lazy ass who had treated Miguel like a doormat all semester. He almost never bothered to even come, and when he HAD showed up to help, he’d just sit there texting his friends while Miguel did all the work anyway. Miguel told himself he was just suffering through a shitty partner because he didn’t want to jeopardize his GPA, but the truth was that he was intimidated by Robert. He was the perfect water polo jock (which made sense because he was team captain): blonde hair, blue eyes, a toned frame with rippling abs and a light dusting of hair (on the off season).<br />
<br />
Miguel felt like a wimp compared to him. Even though he knew they were both gay, Robert just seemed… more manly, more intense. Miguel was flat as a board and couldn’t even grow enough wispy hairs to claim that he had a mustache. He had clear, smooth skin and beautiful almond eyes that made him seem more like a porcelain doll than a man. His hair swept up naturally in a bouncy quiff. And even with the added height of his hair, he was a good six inches shorter than Robert.<br />
<br />
He bounced his knee up and down and tapped his pencil against the table. Maybe it was time to just stop waiting and get started… He reached into his backpack for his notes, when he heard a whisper float through the room. It almost felt like the words were floating somewhere in his subconscious rather than being spoken aloud.<br />
<br />
“I wish you weren’t the only hairy dom top of your class…”<br />
<br />
He strained his to try and catch the words, but he couldn’t quite make them out. Weirdly, the image of his T.A. Ken popped into his mind. He wasn’t sure why. He didn’t particularly like Ken. If he didn’t already know he lived on campus, Miguel would think he was the exact kind of guy to be living in his mother’s basement. Pimply, greasy, smelly, a bit overweight. Not the kind of guy you want popping into your head randomly. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Miguel felt a head rush, as though he had stood up suddenly. He rubbed his temples and tried to collect his thoughts. What had he been thinking about? Oh yeah, Ken, that piece of meat. He kept everything strictly professional when it came to his T.A. position, but Miguel knew he tore up all kind of ass in his frat. How could he not, with that full brown pelt and beer can cock…<br />
<br />
His reverie was interrupted by the sudden arrival of Robert. The tanned Adonis ran a hand through his golden hair and frowned. “You haven’t started yet?”<br />
<br />
An uncharacteristic flare of anger caused Miguel to see red, but he took a breath and growled out, “The fuck is that supposed to mean?”<br />
<br />
“Jesus, Miguel, I was just joshing around with ya. Take it easy, dude.” Robert sat down, annoyed that his “homework helper” didn’t seem to be in a particularly helpful mood. He grabbed Miguel’s binder out of his backpack and laid it on the table, flipping through the notes until he found the right page. He reached to grab a pen, but Miguel caught his wrist with a surprisingly firm grip. <br />
<br />
Miguel growled again, his voice a low rumble, “Did I say you could go through my things, Robert?”<br />
<br />
Robert balked. Since when had Miguel been so intense? “OK, OK, I surrender. You can get your own pen out. Be my guest.”<br />
<br />
Miguel blinked and looked surprised at his own actions. His voice sounded deeper than it had before. Was he maybe getting a cold? “Sorry man, I guess I’m just stressed with finals coming up. Let’s just get this thing finished, OK?”<br />
<br />
“OK, dude.” Robert stared at the notebook sheepishly. “Uh… Can I borrow a pen?”<br />
<br />
Miguel smirked. “I’m always stuck taking care of you, aren’t I?” He rifled through his backpack and pulled out a blue ballpoint. “Here. It’s a gift.”<br />
<br />
“Uh… thanks?” Robert popped the cap, pulled out his textbook, and began to copy down a couple notes from the chapter they were meant to be presenting on. Miguel scooted next to him, so close that Robert could feel the heat radiating from his skin. “Do you mind?”<br />
<br />
Miguel scoffed. “Actually, I do mind. Ever since we started working together at the beginning of the semester, you haven’t been pulling your weight.” He stood up in a huff and poked his finger into Robert’s chest. <br />
<br />
“Alright, that’s enough!” shouted Robert, scrambling out of his chair. “What gives you the right to- when did you get so tall?” Robert realized now that they were standing that he was barely up to Miguel’s shoulders. “You wearing stilts or something, pa- pal?”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” Miguel looked down, feeling dizzy all of a sudden. Had the ground always been that far away? Had Robert always been that short? From this angle he sure didn’t seem like much of a threat. Why had he always been so intimidated by this wimp? No matter. He continued. “You better get your ass in gear before you fail this class, because I’m not going to help you out anymore.” He jabbed his finger into Robert’s chest one more time just for good measure. The blonde flinched, rubbing his pec as if he’d been bruised. “Don’t be such a baby, Robbie. And look at me when I’m talking to you.”<br />
<br />
Robert looked Miguel, afraid to meet his eyes. What had come over his classmate? He had always been such a pushover, but now he was so… strong. So… sexy. And had he always been that muscular? Robert stepped back as he saw MIguel’s body pulse outward, as if he were taking a breath. But it never went back down. His chest now stuck out in a hard shelf that strained against his button-down. His skinny arms were inflating with muscle until he had biceps that looked like they could curl a small car. His legs inflated until his thighs looked like juicy thick hams. He could tell Miguel’s butt was inflating as well, but he didn’t dare look.<br />
<br />
“Robbie… I said look me in the eyes.” Miguel pointed at his face, the motion from his bulging arm causing his sleeves to rip open, his shirt falling into tatters on the ground. Robert could see that he had grown a firm six-pack to complement that granite chest. He moved his gaze up Miguel’s face until he met his gaze, not without some trepidation. How had he never noticed how beautiful those almond brown eyes were? He stared rapt at those glistening pools. Miguel was saying something but he couldn’t make it out. Those eyes were just so irresistible.<br />
<br />
Robert didn’t even notice the next wave of changes spreading across Miguel’s newly hunky body. He unhooked his belt and let his pants take his underwear to the floor. Thick black hair appeared on his toes, twisting around his ankles as it spread up his tree trunk legs and bulbous ass. It paused briefly at his crotch, becoming a tangled mat of pubes that hid his flaccid dick until it emerged triumphantly, expanding four inches as it became engorged, a drop of pre-cum glistening at the tip. Thick black hair cross-hatched its way up the ridges of his abs, blossoming like a flower across his ample chest and swirling around his taut nipples.<br />
<br />
Hair sprouted across his clavicles but stopped before it reached his neck. His lip twitched as tiny hairs wriggled out of their follicles, growing and spreading to become a luscious black mustache. He wetted it with his tongue and moaned deep in the back of his throat. His hair wilted like a flower, and he slicked it back with his left hand, pulsing with power as a crazed bush of hair poked out of his armpit in random directions.<br />
<br />
Robert hadn’t noticed any of this, however. He was too busy staring into those beautiful eyes. That sexy, smoldering stare. How had he never noticed… How had he never kissed those plump lips. He leaned in to give Miguel a kiss, but Miguel was too fast for him. He  grabbed his arm, spun him around, and pinned him against the table, sweeping the binder and backpack off with his free hand. “I’m in charge now, Robbie boy. You don’t get to make the decisions.”<br />
<br />
Robert groaned with ecstasy. Normally he liked being the one in control, but something about this man, and the undeniable musky scent that was starting to fill the room, was turning him on something fierce. He bucked his ass against Miguel’s engorged dick. <br />
<br />
“Now that’s more like it, Robbie…” Miguel spat on his hand and rubbed saliva on his glistening cock. “You might be the captain in the pool, but I’m the captain in here.” He rammed his throbbing dick into Robbie’s tight ass and began to thrust like a piston, tweaking his nipple as he went. He felt something hard between his fingers that glinted in the light. Oh right, his piercing. Of course! He grabbed the silver hoop and gave it a tug, sending ripples of pleasure through his body.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Miguel, oh my God!” moaned Robert in ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Miguel stopped suddenly. “Robbie. What did you call me?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Sorry. Papi. Papi, your dick is so huge.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah it is, Robbie.” Miguel moaned, starting to thrust again, “And you’re gonna take every inch of it.”</p>
