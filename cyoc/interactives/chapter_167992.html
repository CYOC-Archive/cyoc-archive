Once he was satisfied with the changes to the profile, Jeff shifted his attention back to his beautiful new pig. He had always desired to spend time with a sow of such beauty, so he knew had been blessed with a once in a lifetime opportunity. His mother had once tantalized him with her unnatural beauty. Her gorgeous upturned nose, blonde hair, and her curvy porcine features had brought him many fantasies which Jeff once thought he’d always have to suppress. The Chronivac had changed everything. Jeff let go of the long-buried fantasies of his hot mother as he looked upon his majestic new pig. The pig still retained many of her human features. Although the Chronivac had reduced her mind to that of a breeding sow, he had made sure to preserve some of her awareness and a shred of her former memories. Her upturned nose had pushed out into a partial snout and tusks had sprouted from her lips. While her face was visibly porcine, it still  unmistakably resembled the woman she once was. The medium length curly blonde hair that had brought Jeff many an unpleasant erection was just as full as ever, and her dark red lipstick still outlined her thickened piggy lips. Likewise, her bright blue eyes were unchanged as Jeff had hoped. However, Jeff couldn’t help but notice the humanity fading from them as she began to adapt to her new form and instincts—and he loved it. Finally as an added bonus, her golden earrings still adorned her floppy pig ears. Although she was now a pig in mind and body, the earrings provided a reminder of the human she once was—a superficial mark of her lost humanity.  Jeff decided to leave those, along with the hair. <br />
<br />
Upon realizing how caught up he was in his fantasies, Jeff began to wonder if the Chronivac was affecting his mind as well. For a moment he realized that he had begun to subconsciously think of her as his pet pig, and not as his mother. “No matter” Jeff thought as he looked back at his pig. “Time to have some fun.” While Jeff was caught up in his own thoughts, his pig was trotting aimlessly around the floor of his room. Although Jeff had removed her bursting top when she was transitioning, her black yoga pants had survived her metamorphosis. Jeff noticed with delight how her impeccable rear end seemed almost unaffected by her transformation, besides the hooves that had burst through her socks and the bulge in her yoga pants which Jeff knew to be her cute little corkscrew tail. Jeff revelled in the thought of a half-clothed pigwoman trotting around his room, and it made his penis grow uncontrollably hard. However, Jeff had a few quality of life improvements to attend to before having any fun with his hog. Jeff wanted his pig to be comfortable, so he grabbed a pair of scissors from his desk and carefully cut through the back end of her tightly stretched yoga pants so her bunched up corkscrew tail could fly free. Her corkscrew tail popped through the tear, and Jeff couldn’t help but notice how her perfect pink vagina had migrated up to meet her pert butthole below her new tail. <br />
<br />
The platinum blonde pig turned to look at her new owner with a vacant stare, and snorted in delight at having her tail liberated from the pressure of her tight yoga pants. Fading thoughts of her past life flickered dimly through her dulled mind, but they were overwhelmed by her new sow instincts and the sensations brought about by her heightened senses. For a moment she thought that her helpful human owner looked familiar, but it was of no importance to her. He looked good, and he seemed delighted to be around her—and she smelled the musk that was emanating from his pants intensify as she stared at him. It smelled wonderful to her, and the joyous look on his face made her feel like a good pig.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched gleefully as the pigwoman trotted towards him. He knew that the Chronivac had worked exactly as advertised. His long-buried fantasies had finally been realized unlike anything he could have imagined. His beautiful mother was no more, this was now his pet pig.</p>
