<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“And how is my little refugee from another dimension enjoying her day?” asked Aziza as she sauntered flirtily into the living room of her small but cute home. Actually, it was the guest house that Aziza&#39;s parents let her live in, but that was a distinction without a difference, really. Aziza may have been one of the Sorceresses Supreme and one of the most mighty humans on the planet, but she was still a Millennial and had trouble finding her own place. <br />
<br />
The pretty blonde white girl named Kylie Perkins looked up from the expensive 4K television and yawned. She was still in her pajamas despite it being 3:00 P.M in the afternoon. A bong was sitting conspicuously on the glass coffee table.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not bad. Played some Overwatch earlier. Now I&#39;m taking it easy and binging Better Call Saul. You wouldn&#39;t think that it would work so well with all women, but it&#39;s great!”<br />
<br />
Aziza sat down next to Kylie on the cozy couch and kissed her softly on the lips. Coronavirus or no, some things she just wasn&#39;t willing to sacrifice. <br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t Better Call Saul a prequel to Breaking Bad? How do they explain Saul being a lady now?” Aziza asked curiously. She had never seen the show. Mournfully, she realized that she hasn&#39;t had time to watch any shows lately, sorcery being a nearly full time job. <br />
<br />
“They just pretend she&#39;s still a man. All the other New Women still pretend they&#39;re men too.”<br />
<br />
“Really? That&#39;s pretty weird if you ask me” Aziza giggled. “I&#39;m not comprehending how a formerly male character could just suddenly become a sexy big titted woman and the show just pretends that she&#39;s somehow not.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s called acting” Kylie rolled her eyes. “Men used to dress up as female characters for hundreds of years when doing stage plays. It&#39;s the same thing here. And who are you to call anyone weird? You&#39;re the Sorceress Supreme! You probably just got back from fighting space vampires who eat stars or something.” <br />
<br />
“Close. Interdimensional parasites that feed on the souls of the living. I had to banish all six quadrillion of them back to their little pissing ground home realm. Goddess, that took a lot out of me” moaned Aziza, suddenly yawning herself. <br />
<br />
“Couldn&#39;t Regina have helped you out with that?”<br />
<br />
“Could Regina have helped me? From Allah&#39;s voice to your ears she could have. Would she have helped me had I bothered to call her? No. She says that she&#39;s stuck in self isolation with her new girlfriend because of coronavirus and it would be irresponsible to leave.”<br />
<br />
“Why would it be irresponsible?” asked Kylie as she grabbed the bong and continued her six hour long wake and bake. <br />
<br />
“Because somehow it&#39;s OK for us to flagrantly defy the laws of physics every time we cast a spell, but somehow introducing a foreign virus into another dimension might inadvertently kill everyone there. Does she have a point? Maybe. But I think she&#39;s being disingenuous as to why she doesn&#39;t want to see me.”<br />
<br />
“Regina&#39;s probably just using this pandemic as an excuse. The bitch is lazier than I am. You&#39;ve been doing all the major hero work for a while now.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it” said Aziza, visibly annoyed as she focused on the show Kylie was watching. “Ever since she turned Oliver Thorfinnson into a cat and stopped that demonic incursion, which admittedly was pretty cool, she&#39;s been coasting.”<br />
<br />
“Well take a load off for a while. The world doesn&#39;t always have to be on your shoulders.”<br />
<br />
Kylie wrapped a slender arm around Aziza&#39;s shoulders and pulled her closer as her program entered a particularly dramatic scene.<br />
<br />
Aziza pretended to veg out with her current girlfriend(Actually, her first girlfriend ever), but in reality the beautiful Arab witch was lost in thought. <br />
<br />
So much had changed in the last few years. First, The Great Change, where (almost) everyone on Earth had been transformed into a gorgeous lesbian, including herself naturally. That had happened because an American woman named Jean who didn&#39;t like men very much had acquired a stupidly powerful magic ring and wished them all away.<br />
<br />
Not too long after that, the former Aziz had come into contact with a brother-sister duo of Sumerian gods who claimed that she had been chosen by fate to be the potential Sorceress Supreme, the magical defender of Earth. With such a major event like The Great Change inevitably attracting attention from otherworldly forces, someone was needed who would provide the bulwark against humanity&#39;s complete annihilation(Or worse, and believe me, worse exists). <br />
<br />
Needless to say, learning about black magic went entirely against Aziz(Now Aziza)&#39;s entire strict religious upbringing in Saudi Arabia, and under normal circumstances would have landed her a death sentence for apostasy. Gratefully, with the entire world in chaos thanks to The Great Change, a nobody twenty year old kid in a backwater part of the country would easily go unnoticed. Aziza agreed to the call to adventure, and she was spirited away.<br />
<br />
At the magical library of Akashic, she met Regina Chung, another potential and fellow man turned woman. The two became fast friends, and together, had passed all of Enlil and Innanna&#39;s many tests. Because of their bond and equal aptitude at harnessing the supernatural, Regina and Aziza had BOTH become worthy of wielding the magic powers of the position of Sorceress Supreme. <br />
<br />
For a while, it was wonderful. The two were like yin and yang. Regina was older and wiser, Aziza was younger and faster. They had made quite a team together defending the Earth from the endless hoards of unspeakable evil that constantly besieged it, but like every honeymoon, it eventually had to end. <br />
<br />
During a trip to a parallel dimension that had threatened to bleed into our own, Aziza had come across another sorceress, a young American woman named Kylie Perkins who had become utterly insane and corrupted by the dark forces she was wielding. Kylie had all but decimated her version of Earth five years earlier, transforming her entire hometown of Glendale, California into hoards of hideous monsters and perverted abominations, laughing off the numerous military strikes that had been made against her. Drunk on her own sense of power, Kylie had designs on conquering other dimensions and had been openly bragging about her invincibility. <br />
<br />
With no small amount of effort, Aziza had managed to outwit the evil but batshit crazy Kylie, beating her at her own game and rendering the rival sorceress into unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
After casting several spells on the sorceress, erasing her memories and blocking access to her potent magical powers, Aziza had pondered what do to with her next. It seemed kind of cruel to leave her in this dimension, damning her to rot in some CIA black site for the rest of her life, undoubtedly to be tortured and interrogated and experimented on against her will. So Aziza took Kylie back home with her to Arabia. Aziza did her best to nurse the emaciated Kylie back to health, and had been gentle in deprogramming her broken mind into something manageable. <br />
<br />
The sweet blonde stoner who was snuggling next to Aziza now was the result of what Kylie had become after two years of living with Aziza. <br />
<br />
Aziza bristled over what happened later with Regina, who vehemently believed that what Aziza had done was immoral, that she had robbed someone of their agency, and it was what had caused the two to have a falling out. <br />
<br />
Aziza was burdened with guilt about her decision. She genuinely felt that it was the best option for Kylie, but she could **never** tell Kylie about it.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Savannah Tullio was an adrenaline junkie. She was addicted to being in peril, always had been, always will be. She also had a taste for brutality that she often struggled to repress. It was why she had become a part of the espionage game in the first place, after an observant Army sergeant had noticed the young man under his charge had all the traits of a sociopath that could better be used elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Domestic life didn&#39;t suit Savannah. It bored her, which was why her marriage had been on the rocks prior to The Great Change. It was also why the current coronavirus pandemic was her worst nightmare. Not being able to go out into the field, to be a predator, was killing her. There was no use for a femme fatale who was stuck at home.<br />
<br />
With her girlfriend Katerina away for the weekend on personal business(The enigmatic Katerina maintaining an impersonal, “Ask me no questions, and I&#39;ll tell you no lies” type relationship when it came to her private life), Savannah had decided to channel all her restless energy into a question that had been bugging her for a while now. <br />
<br />
The assignment that she and Katerina had been on two years ago, infiltrating a cult of wannabe magic users headed by an idiot named Ophelia Thorfinnson(Formerly Oliver) had gone suspiciously TOO well. Mere hours before the two had managed to begin their operation, which undoubtedly would have ended in a whirlwind of violence, Thorfinnson had disappeared. Poof. Nobody understood what had happened. The investigation by the police and the more in depth investigation by government spooks like Savannah and Mother Russia turned up nothing. Thorfinnson&#39;s wife and daughter as well as the people in their lives were all extensively interviewed about what they knew, which turned out to be nothing. They were put under surveillance for three months, and all that was found was that the daughter Cat Thorfinnson was secretly glad that her father-turned-second-mother was gone, as the girl apparently had a long but secret history of being abused by him. <br />
<br />
Whispers began circulating about the Sorcerer Supreme, or in the event of the Great Change, the Sorceress Supreme. Supposedly there was a single human on Earth who wielded the nigh unlimited power of all the known benevolent gods and goddesses. Someone who could not be controlled. Someone who had somehow stayed under the radar for decades, perhaps centuries. <br />
<br />
Many agents in the magical intelligence community believed in the existence of the Sorceress Supreme, mostly the old timers and the especially superstitious ones. The younger, more conservative, or more skeptical agents, like Savannah, did not. The idea of a vigilante operating just right under their noses seemed absurd. It was crap that only existed in comic books. <br />
<br />
Sorcerers, conjurers, and magic users in general were kept on an extremely tight lease by the government. The vast majority of them were just average folks and dabblers who could be easily be persuaded into stopping what they were doing with a visit by a couple of interns wearing black suits. <br />
<br />
The ones who were more competent were simply paid off to not practice their craft, as magic was inherently a game changer on the geopolitical stage and something that was difficult to control.  All of these people were put under surveillance, and once in a blue moon, the ones who seemed especially talented were used as consultants. <br />
<br />
Very rarely, there would be a troublemaker who was adept enough to catch the attention of the agency. When these wannabe Voldemort&#39;s refused to be compliant, people like Savannah were dispatched to deal with them, which never ended well for that person. A part of Savannah was sad that the years of bruises she had acquired as Seth had all disappeared after the Great Change, as each bruise told a different story where she had almost died on the job. Then again, her role as a seductress probably wouldn&#39;t be as effective if she were as banged up as she had been as a man. <br />
<br />
The gorgeous redhead laid out the necessary materials she needed in her basement. A consummate professional, she made every precaution necessary to make sure that she had the upper hand for what she was about to do.<br />
<br />
When she was ready, she spoke the magic words which she knew by heart.<br />
<br />
A swirl of multicolored smoke appeared in the summoning circle. It coalesced into the form of a beautiful swarthy woman with a twinkle in her eye.<br />
<br />
Innanna, looking down who dared to call upon her, saw that Savannah had written the correct symbols inside the circle which forced her to speak the truth, and forced her to comply with the wishes of the mortal who drew them. <br />
<br />
She looked up, and saw Savannah Tullio&#39;s smug smile. <br />
<br />
“I see that you finally got that stick out of your ass. That&#39;s a really nice top. It accentuates your tits.”<br />
<br />
“Goddess Innanna, praise be her name, tell me everything you know about the Sorceress Supreme. I also want to know what happened to Ophelia Thorfinnson.”</p>
