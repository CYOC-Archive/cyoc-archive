<br />
Waiting outside of the main gate terminal of Evansville Regional Airport was Agent Vix. Aware that Lisa, Brenda, and Debra had book flights for their daughters, this was the best time to confront them about Dan. Vix knew that if the issue of the FBI’s involvement with the attempted murder of Wendy doesn’t get cleared, an entire war will break loose. To quell matters, Vix needed to contact the pack leader directly. She had played out several scenarios in her head and weighed the option of informing the pack or leaving them out of the loop. Vix concluded that the best way to prevent any more mishaps from happening was to get them involved. Not only that, but she’ll be able to get an insight of what their true intentions were. The plan was risky, but so far she didn’t want to have another situation with the entire pack. Shortly, Vix sees the group heading out of the exit.<br />
<br />
“Lisa Singer, Debra Peters, Brenda McDonald,” someone called out. All three women stopped and turned toward a black haired woman.<br />
<br />
“Who wants to know?” replied Lisa stepping forward.<br />
<br />
“Federal Agent Vixy Pratt,” she said showing her badge. Debra and Brenda moved closer to Lisa. “We have much to discuss,” Vix continued.<br />
<br />
“Yes we do, dear, yes we do,” answered Lisa.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Monday, Three-thirty in the Afternoon, September 25. Lisa’s Home.<br />
<br />
Lisa, Debra, Brenda, and Vix agreed to meet at Lisa’s home shortly after their encounter at the airport. All four women entered the home, silent. They were all on edge, not knowing what might happen next. Lisa escorted them to the living room.<br />
“So since we’re already acquainted, why don’t we start?” Lisa said as she brought out some tea.<br />
<br />
“You all know Dan Ramer is responsible for the death of an officer as well as almost killing a federal officer,” Vix stated.<br />
<br />
“Wendy,” Brenda softly spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yes. It is my understanding that Dan had set a trap for Wendy and independently premeditated her murder, but she was lucky that she wore her vest.” Vix said empathetically.<br />
<br />
“Independently… that means the FBI wasn’t involved?” inquired Debra.<br />
<br />
“We would never order an execution of a fellow agent. We didn’t even know at the time that Wendy was… compromised.” Vix was tempted to say infected but thought better. “Dan Ramer acted alone without orders.”<br />
<br />
“And what if you’ve known?” asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
“Nothing would have changed as long as she continued her duty.” Vix responded. “With that in mind, there is an important question I have to ask. Wendy and Dan were not alone when they met. There was a call to the police department during the time of the shooting which means someone was at the crime while it occurred. Do you know anyone who could have followed Wendy to the scene?” she said looking around.<br />
<br />
Lisa was cautious on what she said next. She would never trust the safety of her pack with the bureau after what happened with Wendy. This could be a ruse to let down their guard. “I don’t know who would have followed Wendy, dear. Truth isn’t something we hide from each other. Maybe it was Dan that had help.”<br />
<br />
Vix knew that was a sign of distrust, an obstacle she’ll need to get over. “Perhaps, but the center of this investigation will be of both Wendy and Dan’s involvement. There are those who may sympathize with Dan’s story that the betrayal came from Wendy.”<br />
<br />
“This isn’t right! Dan was the one that shot her!” exclaimed Brenda.<br />
<br />
“And killed a deputy,” injected Debra.<br />
<br />
“That is true, but I don’t know the reasons that led him to that point. I’ve already established that they weren’t alone. There could have been more than just the caller. He could have acted in self defense and killed the officer to protect the secret for all I know.” Vix knew she was pushing the line with that statement.<br />
<br />
Lisa made a silent motion. She, Debra, and Brenda rose from their seats. “You don’t trust us do you?” Lisa pityingly stated.<br />
<br />
“What I trust is the truth,” Vix stared into Lisa’s eyes. “It is the only thing I trust.”<br />
<br />
“It must make for a very lonely life dear,” Lisa said with a hint of sadness.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea.” Vix briefly looked down.<br />
<br />
“I believe I do.” Lisa replied coolly. Slowly she approaches Vix. “After my first transformation, I was lost and distant from the world. It wasn’t until I realized that it was a gift that I was finally able to understand myself. That’s how I met Debra and everyone else. We’ve been together ever since. Dear Vixy, you don’t have to go through life alone.”<br />
<br />
Vix’s eyes darted toward Debra and Brenda. They both had started to circle around her, moving in opposite directions while Lisa walked forward. Vix aware that she was being surrounded slowly moves her hands on the couch as if to use it as leverage to stand. “Well sometimes… I like being alone!” Vix smartly pulled out a small contractible crossbow pointing it right at Lisa.<br />
<br />
“Rather archaic aren’t we?” mocked Lisa.<br />
<br />
“It does its job.” coldly Vix replied as she back up over the couch, trying to prevent Debra and Brenda from completely surrounding her. “I wouldn’t try anything if I were any of you. It’s a repeater crossbow with silver nitrate in each dart.”<br />
<br />
Lisa shrugged. “Why with the sudden aggression, Vixy? We didn’t do anything to instigate this little charade.” <br />
<br />
“Spare me the guilt trip. I know how your kind does things, surrounding your prey while offering me to join. Is this how you manage to get Wendy?” There was an undertone of anger in her voice.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Lisa answered smoothly. “Wendy made her decision to join on her own. I merely gave her the opportunity. In fact, she’s a lot like you, dear. Quick, intelligent, and cunning.”<br />
<br />
“I know my own strengths.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed you do, dear,” Lisa said admirably. “You wouldn’t want to kill me at the risk of creating a war that is if what you said before was true.”<br />
<br />
“Then understand this. I have no intention of joining.” Vix said as she backs into a wall.<br />
<br />
Lisa gave a slight wave. Debra and Brenda back away and stand behind Lisa. “You need only to say,” Lisa said halfheartedly.<br />
<br />
Vix lowered her weapon, breathing a slight sigh of relief. “I still need to talk to you about Dan.”<br />
<br />
“We can discuss about it later at the meeting,” Lisa said, “I’m sure everyone will want to hear it. Be here by nine thirty tonight, I’ll take you there.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be here,” Vix agreed putting away her crossbow. “No tricks though, I will be armed.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” Lisa smiled. <br />
<br />
Vix made her way to the front door but found it locked. Looking closer, it required a key to unlock it from both sides. Lisa appeared behind Vix, reaching over her shoulders with the key. “The offer still stands, dear. Anytime,” she whispers as she unlocks the door. Vix quickly opened and without looking back, made her way to her car.<br />
Debra stood next to Lisa as they watch the black mustang pass by. “Do you think it’s a good idea to let a federal agent into our meeting?” Debra asked with concern.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Lisa replied reassuringly, “There’s no need to worry, love. I have my belief in her.”<br />
<br />
Vix speedily drove through the neighborhood. She was excited that the meeting went alarmingly well. Not only she put up a strong front, but she was also somewhat submissive to give the alpha hope that she might join. A little part of her hoped that they would have tried to use force. She takes out a wire from her collar. The recordings would have been evidence if they did assault her, and she would be justified in killing them while preventing an all out war. Even then something twinges in her mind about the ordeal, was it all just an act like she planned or was there something more. She still hated for what they are, lycanthropes. However, Vix also saw a bond among them that even she wishes she still had, sisterhood.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Nine-fifteen in the Evening, September 25. Near Lisa’s Home.<br />
<br />
Vix pulls up on the road leading to Lisa’s home. She had reluctantly consulted with Blackhorn with her plan, which in return was met with frustration. He didn’t understand how lycanthropes worked. It was all too risky for him and denied the request of having the Ranger team for back up in an attempt to dismay her. Vix wasn’t going to back down and since she worked for a different division, he didn’t have much say on her anyways. She was on this alone for now. No wires, no backup, and no retreat.<br />
<br />
Vix slowly moved her mustang on the road adjacent to Lisa’s home. She sat inside for several minutes monitoring what was going on, which wasn’t much. The lights were off inside the home, but Lisa’s car was still parked in the driveway. Smiling, Vix rolled down her windows and called out. “You can stop trying to sneak up on me Lisa. I know you’re out there.” There was silence.<br />
<br />
“Very impressive, dear. How did you know I was out here?” Lisa asked appearing right next to Vix’s window.<br />
<br />
“Experience,” Vix turned to meet Lisa’s feral gaze.<br />
<br />
Debra took a step back, allowing Vix to exit her vehicle. Wordlessly, they both entered Debra’s car and drove on out.<br />
<br />
Several minutes pass before Lisa decided to break the ice. “You said experience, have you’ve worked with werewolves before?”<br />
<br />
“You could say that,” Vix replied truthfully. She didn’t work to help lycanthropes, only against.<br />
<br />
“Ah, that’s how you know so much about us. Tell me, how is it like being in a special branch of the FBI?”<br />
<br />
Vix was caught slightly off guard by that question. She knew that Lisa had to have resources that compromised Wendy, but what Vix didn’t know is how deep her informants can get. “Rewarding, the pay is good and I get plenty of vacation days.”<br />
<br />
“But you never took a vacation, not even a sick day.” Lisa smiled as she took a turn.<br />
<br />
“I’m saving them up,” Vix said simply looking at passing traffic.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you’ll need them sooner than you expect?” Lisa started to accelerate her car.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps, it depends where life takes me.” Vix shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Do you always keep so many secrets to yourself?”<br />
<br />
“It comes with the job.”<br />
<br />
Lisa mused to herself how Vix was handling the situation. She wasn’t betraying any additional information other than the obvious and that she was also good at dodging questions.<br />
<br />
“Back when you pulled out that crossbow, you really weren’t going to shoot me, were you dear?” She slows her car as she comes to a red light.<br />
<br />
“It hasn’t stopped me before.”<br />
<br />
The car stopped and Lisa looked over at a smiling Vix. She wasn’t any ordinary federal agent. There wasn’t once a smell of sweat or the look of tension in Vix during the trip. Was she bluffing about killing a werewolf? Lisa couldn’t find out what branch Vix came from since the name Vixy Pratt wasn’t on file. She had figured it was special and had to do with Dan being a rogue federal agent, but now Lisa wasn’t sure if that was Vix’s true purpose. Whoever Vix was, it would be invaluable to have her into the pack. Vix had proven herself that this afternoon and now. Lisa had to play her cards carefully, least she finds herself being at the wrong end of the table. The light turned green and Lisa continued on.<br />
<br />
“I heard that you visited Wendy while she was recovering. I wasn’t there myself. Can you tell me how she was?”<br />
<br />
“She was shaken and afraid. I believe I didn’t help matters by being there.” Vix had thought Wendy would have given Lisa an accurate description of the person who investigated. Lying would risk too much and she still needed to gain Lisa’s trust.<br />
<br />
There was a hint of concern in Vix’s voice that Lisa noted. “Dear, you told me that your name is Vixy Pratt, but you told Wendy a different name, Jennifer Grogan. Now which one is yours?”<br />
<br />
“Neither, those are cover names I use to protect the secrecy of lycanthropes. You can call me Vix.” This confirmed that Wendy’s loyalty with her pack supersedes the integrity of the FBI. It wasn’t necessary for her to give so much information on such a sensitive nature to those being investigated. “Wendy must be very loyal to tell you of my visit.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve already told you, my dear Vix. Truth isn’t something we hide from each other. I only asked because I care for her. It was a federal agent that almost killed her. Surely, you can understand my concern.”<br />
<br />
Vix remained silent. She did understand, but didn’t want to say it. The part of Vix that hated lycanthropes had welled up with the last statement Vix made. She was also afraid of betraying what she felt about Wendy if she responded. Quite frankly, Vix didn’t know what to feel.<br />
<br />
The rest of the trip was silent and they eventually arrive at their destination.</p>
