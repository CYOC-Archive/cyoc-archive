<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Almost inmediatly Joel entered his house a beach ball fell on his backyard. It landed on Raul&#39;s cum mess and it got stuck on the sticky grass near to where Raul was lying.<br />
A little boy&#39;s voice could be heard from the other side of the fence. It sounded like he was looking for his ball and after some minutes he realized he had threw it over the fence. The little boy tried to climb the fence, but he was too small and weak to do it, also the fence was almost three times his height and pointy at the end. He thought that the best thing to do was to ask for his ball, but despite he asked it louder and louder he didn&#39;t get a response. He was becoming desperate and he started to kick the fence with his small feet, but he didn&#39;t get anything from that. <br />
The little boy almost resigned when he saw a cat jumping over the fence from a tree in his backyard. The tree wasn&#39;t too high and he had climbed it once time before. So, he thought that it was the way he could get back his ball. He took an old bucket his mom had left on the backyard and putting it upside down he reach a tree branch. It was enough strong to bear the little boy&#39;s weight, so he can walk through it. He was too scared that he embraced the tree branch and closed his eyes as he moved through it. When he saw he was almost over the fence, he realized he hadn&#39;t thought how to go down. He can&#39;t go back after all he had done until now, so he tried to jump like the cat before. His jumping wasn&#39;t too long and he barely crossed the fence. Obviously, he got hurted when he landed, his hands and knees were covered in mud and he stayed on the floor for a minute.<br />
After he recovered, he walked on Joel&#39;s backyard for a minute looking for his ball. However he found a lawn mower instead. It was warm so he guessed it was used recently, when he put his hand over it he felt a sticky thing on it, he didn&#39;t know what that was but he didn&#39;t care too much about it. He was looking for his ball after all.<br />
He kept walking until he reach an almost hidden section of Joel&#39;s backyard. It wasn&#39;t very visible through any other place than Raul&#39;s home so it was the place where Raul had chosen to fight Joel and all the previous things happened. When the little boy reached it, the first thing he saw was a completely nude man sleeping on the grass. He surprised because he hadn&#39;t seen any other adult naked besides his dad once time on the beach. He thought all those hairs around Raul&#39;s body were funny because he resembles a monkey or some animal like that. His dad had those hairs too and he remembered he had tried to pull them off from his dad&#39;s chest but his dad screamed when he did it so he wasn&#39;t able to get any of them in that time. Maybe with this sleeping guy he finally could make it.<br />
The little boy walked to Raul a few steps when he remembered he was looking for his ball. He looked around him and he saw the ball a few feet away from Raul&#39;s left leg. He went to it carefully in order to don&#39;t disturb the sleeping man next to it but he needed to walk across his legs in order to get his ball. When he started to walk through Raul&#39;s legs he felt an unusual itching on the hand he had used to touch the lawn mower. He scratched it but a second later, he flipped and fell between Raul&#39;s legs. He wondered why he had fallen until he saw that almost all the grass around him was covered in the same weird goo like the lawn mower one. He thought he will need a bath after this, so he hurried to return his home as fast as he can but when he tried to stand up he realized he was losing his balance and he was slipping on the goo some more times.<br />
This imbalance was too strange to him, the grass was slippery but it wasn&#39;t too much. After the third time he tried to stand up, he saw something unusual. His left foot was almost close to Raul&#39;s belly when it wasn&#39;t that far before. Also, his leg stretched a few inches beyond his pants. He wondered if his clothes were getting smaller on him.<br />
The fourth time he slipped his right foot fell over Raul&#39;s dick which make him felt weird. His ankle&#39;s skin had made direct contact with Raul&#39;s dick. It felt warm and solid, besides it was soft. He felt some warm in him too, but it was overcome by a sudden pain on his body.<br />
His foot that had touched Raul&#39;s dick suddenly burst out ripping off his small shoe and revealing a big and manly size 12 foot. He astounded of it and tried to grab it with his hand but he realized his hand had changed as well into a big hand too. His other foot and hand suddenly grew too until he looked funny with his small body and his huge feet and hands. He was scared and tried to stand up and to run to his house but in that moment, his chest burst out from his little t-shirt revealing a manly chest with wide shoulders, two big rounded pecs and a decent 6-pack. It was too heavy for him that he fell on the grass again, unable to stand up this time.<br />
&quot;I need to go home!&quot; He said, but he stopped when he heard his new deeper voice, it was an octave deeper. Surprised, he grabbed his throat and then he felt a bulge growing in there. Also, he felt how long and heavy were his arms now, but he had alot of new strength to bear it. He used them to rise his upper body. He saw his butt was almost close to Raul&#39;s one and his legs had elongated until they were near to Rau&#39;s throat.<br />
&quot;Wow! It seems I have another guest on my house&quot; Joel said as he stayed near to the fence. &quot;What&#39;s your name, lad?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Noah&quot; The guy answered.<br />
&quot;Noah, my 6 years old neighbor?&quot; Joel said a little bit surprised.<br />
&quot;Joel?&quot; Noah replied. &quot;It&#39;s that you? Why you&#39;re so big and hairy and naked?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because of the same reason that you are, my little friend...&quot; Joel said smiling. &quot;And talking about little friends...&quot;<br />
Noah looked  at what Joel was pointing out, his legs had gotten big and hairy, his chest was covered in hair too. Even, his arms had some but what was completely amazing was the dick he had grown. It was as thick as Joel&#39;s one and long as Raul&#39;s one which were touching it at the moment. Noah saw how some veins started to be visible on it, but his sight was quickly impeded by a sudden growth on his crotch. A thick Bush grew on him impeding him to see his big dick as before.<br />
&quot;Ahh!!! A spider on my pee-pee!&quot; Noah cried.<br />
&quot;And on your armpits&quot; Joel said as he put his hand on Noah&#39;s armpits. &quot;These wildness is better than any jungle for sure!&quot;<br />
Noah felt new arousing feelings as Joel was touching his new hairy armpits. The arousal was too much for his kid&#39;s mind that he shot a small amount of semen at that moment.<br />
&quot;The kid&#39;s gone&quot; Joel said smiling. &quot;Now, the man arrives!&quot;<br />
Noah&#39;s dick started to get hard again, but way more bigger than before. It grew until it was 10 inches long and ready to shoot his load. Veins started to pop out as Noah was getting more and more aroused. His small balls, the last remaining of his childhood grew to reach a perfect sample of manhood, big as tennis balls. They were right next to Raul&#39;s big set.<br />
&quot;I feel something!&quot; Noah shouted. &quot;Aaahhhhh!!!&quot; And then he shot a big amount of cum from his pole directly to Raul&#39;s chest. After that, he fell fainted in the grass in a similar position as Raul with both dicks and balls touching each other.<br />
Joel left Noah&#39;s armpits and stood up. He smiled as he saw two big, hairy and naked men lying on his backyard in a scissor-like position.</p>
