<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to rawr7 for helping with this chapter! <br/>
This is a redo of the chapter by the same name. There were quite a few errors in the last version that I couldn&#39;t fix since I accidentally posted the chapter after it without thinking. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Trevor could shoot Todd, there was a loud pounding on the door. The half-nuki groaned in frustration before turning around and walking to the door. He opened the door, and Todd could see the Kirin from earlier standing there.<br />
 <br />
“What do you want, idiot?” Trevor snarled, pointing a gun at his face.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; The brutish Kirin looked around and blinked. The floor was oddly silent, most of the patrons being ushered to other floors. &quot;Boss, the floor is clearing...I think something&#39;s happening.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Trevor looked behind them and saw the busy floor starting to clear up. His eyes narrowed.<br />
 <br />
“Shit! You two come inside, now!” Trevor hissed.<br />
 <br />
Both the stegosaurus and the Kirin entered the bathroom. Todd watched them look at the bear skin rug that used to be Mark and the jockstrap that used to be Xavier.<br />
 <br />
“We are in a bit of a predicament,” Trevor said. “It seems like the Dolans are planning something.”<br />
 <br />
“What do you mean, Boss?” Rusty asked.<br />
 <br />
“They plan to attack and corner us in this bathroom,” he said, cocking his gun. <br />
 <br />
He turned to Todd and shook his head.<br />
 <br />
“You’re a very lucky fox,” he said. “I want to turn you into something that suits my needs so badly right now, but I need the extra firepower…” As Trevor started to turn around, he stopped and suddenly clutched his head. His gray fur was transforming into feathers.<br />
 <br />
Todd sighed in relief. <br />
 <br />
By knocking on the door, the Kirin had just bought him a few extra seconds, and those extra seconds were all that he needed for the transformation to wear off.<br />
 <br />
The raccoon in front of him began to change rather quickly. The digits of his paws began to merge, creating an avian-like foot with three toes in the front and one in the back. The nails on each of these new “toes” lengthened and sharpened, becoming razor-sharp talons. The fur on his feet began to recede into his body, being replaced by black scales from his ankles down.<br />
 <br />
Trevor’s gray fur was slowly being replaced by red and gold feathers that blended in a way that reminded Todd of the rising sun. The fur on the raccoon’s tail began to lengthen and split into its sections before turning into large, elegant tail feathers.<br />
 <br />
As the feathers continued to overtake the fur on his body, Trevor’s beer belly disappeared, retreating into his body. His muscles shrank slightly, giving the changing male a well-muscled but gangly build. His fingers began to thicken slightly as his thumb shrank back into his body. As black scales began to grow in, his claws lengthened further, becoming slightly sharper in the process. Large feathers began to grow from his arms, giving his arms the ability to act as wings if needed.<br />
 <br />
As the changes reached his head, Trevor clutched his head in pain as new memories (or in this case, old memories) flooded into his mind. He was so preoccupied with trying to push through the pain that he didn’t notice his muzzle curving and hardening into an orange beak. As the feathers overtook his head, the Phoenix morph let out a loud squawk.<br />
 <br />
When the transformation finally died down, the phoenix began to look around the bathroom with a confused look on his face.<br />
 <br />
“What the hell?” he asked. “What happened? Where the hell am I?”<br />
 <br />
He turned around in time to see Rusty and Rok’s clothes change back into what they were wearing before. Both the Cerberus-morph and the cyclops looked as confused as he did.<br />
 <br />
“What the…? Weren’t we just on the Body floor?” Rusty asked, looking around the bathroom. Upon seeing Troy, all three of his heads let out sighs of relief. “Oh thank God, you’re back to normal. Also, why do I have my fingers up your ass, Todd?” <br />
 <br />
The canine pulled his fingers out, making Todd moan softly.<br />
 <br />
“Back to normal?” Troy asked. “What do you mean? Did something happen?”<br />
 <br />
“Xavier turned you into a corrupt raccoon mob boss,” Todd spoke up, clutching his jaw as he got off the floor. “You turned him into a jockstrap for stealing those decoy rings you made. You then turned Mark into a bear skin rug for calling you an asshole. I managed to buy myself just enough time before you shot me in the head and turned me into…something.”<br />
 <br />
The phoenix morph looked at the jockstrap in disgust and horror. “Oh, God!”<br />
 <br />
“Oh right, I should probably fix that,” Todd said. <br />
 <br />
“I wouldn’t do that quite yet, Todd.” Feng spoke, stepping forward and crossing his arms.<br />
 <br />
“Who are you?” Troy asked.<br />
 <br />
“The original Xavier. I anticipated Trevor would try to kill me or transform me if I were caught, so I created a double.”<br />
 <br />
“Or you’re just one of his Blanks and inserted his Mind and Soul chips,” Todd replied. “I saw you putting the chips in your head a second ago.”<br />
 <br />
“My Mind and Soul chips,”  Feng replied.<br />
 <br />
“He’s lying” Rusty growled, stepping forward.<br />
 <br />
Rex stood next to Feng, placing a hand on his shoulder and glaring at the Cerberus.<br />
 <br />
“I’ll prove that I’m the real Xavier-slash-Xarxos.” Feng turned to Troy. “Sit.”<br />
 <br />
Troy wobbled, his legs suddenly feeling weak. The command forced his butt to the ground. The loose jockstrap, built for a far thicker man, squished wetly.<br />
 <br />
“That was the Familiar spell, which I cast on you when you asked me to turn you into a dog a few weeks ago,” Feng said. “Your jockstrap is powerless, couldn’t even cast a spell on me.”<br />
 <br />
There were mutters all around the room.<br />
 <br />
“Okay. I believe you. But it’s your fault things ended up this way.” Rok said. “You entered a machine and lost yourself.”<br />
 <br />
“I think we should stuff him back into one of those VR games,” Rusty growled. “I don’t like the idea that he has control over Troy like that.”<br />
 <br />
Feng sensed a growing hostility in the room and nodded.<br />
 <br />
“Alright. Let me give you a few good reasons changing me right now is a bad idea.” Feng stroked his beard.<br />
 <br />
“I don’t like the level of control you have over me either.” Troy frowned. “I vote to transform you into something safer for us to be around.”<br />
 <br />
“I haven’t even given an argument yet.” Feng pointed out.<br />
 <br />
“I don’t care.” Troy crossed his arms.<br />
 <br />
“Me neither. Voting to turn him into a beaver construction worker.” Rusty raised his hand.<br />
 <br />
Feng rolled his eyes and turned to the others. “Look, I have a way to get close to the real Dolan and ways to get intel from them. We can turn the jockstrap back into Xavier and send him to infiltrate them.”<br />
 <br />
“Could be useful. But we can always just use your clone to do that. No need to involve you in the process.” Rok said, raising his hand. “How do we know that you won’t backstab us?”<br />
 <br />
“If it weren’t for me, Mark would be dead. Based on Trevor’s actions, they would just be gone and we’d be none the wiser.”<br />
 <br />
“Don’t say that as if you cared about me!” Todd shot back. “You used me like a pawn in that maze and in your reality, you left me a babbling idiot!”<br />
 <br />
“Do you know how long it takes for a mind to break from repeated orgasms?” Feng asked.<br />
 <br />
“An hour, apparently.”<br />
 <br />
“No.” Feng turned. “You had the same thing done to you, except you came out just fine, didn’t you?”<br />
 <br />
“What are you implying?” Rok asked.<br />
 <br />
“Dolan accelerated Time in our timeline, taking Todd out of the picture. And I think I know why.”<br />
 <br />
“Why?”<br />
 <br />
“Because he knew he was a threat. The moment you entered the Casino, Prime Dolan likely traveled in Time and was waiting in that Maze. You do something Todd, something that keeps us all alive.”<br />
 <br />
“Like what?” Todd rolled his eyes. <br />
 <br />
“I have no idea, but it’s pretty clear you were targeted in our Timeline.”<br />
 <br />
Everyone mulled over his words.<br />
 <br />
Troy noticed and quickly raised his finger. Rex stepped in front of Feng just in time to deflect a spell. Everyone stared at the actual, visible spell as it glittered through the air, a strange green color <br />
 <br />
“Troy?” Rusty asked. “Why did you do that?”<br />
 <br />
“I’m tired of talking! We fight, and I want to get rid of the ball and chain that’s been attached to my leg!”<br />
 <br />
“Oh, right, I saved the best reason for last.” Feng slapped his forehead. “Right. The reason a should stay me is that I need to keep the moronic idiot who created this entire fucking mess in check.”<br />
 <br />
“Who?” Rok asked.<br />
 <br />
“Fucking Troy,” Feng growled.<br />
 <br />
Everyone glanced at each other.<br />
 <br />
“You’re a fucking liar!” Troy exploded and turned to the rest of the group. “Don’t you believe a word this lying fuck says!”<br />
 <br />
“Why were you wearing fake rings around me?” Feng asked<br />
 <br />
“Because I wanted to throw Dolan off and make sure any changes I did were temporary.”<br />
 <br />
“Why didn’t you have my back in the Machine when I went to rescue Mark?”<br />
 <br />
Todd blinked. “Wait, Troy was with you?”<br />
 <br />
“He should have been. I asked him to watch my back.”<br />
 <br />
“It took over 25 minutes guys.” Troy shrugged. “I got bored and went to watch a wrestling match.”<br />
 <br />
“Didn’t call anyone when Mark and I went into the machine?” Feng didn’t wait for a response, continuing. “Did you guys call?”<br />
 <br />
“We did. We called Troy.” Rusty nodded.<br />
 <br />
“Because I was with Troy for hours after the Sex Machine as Xavier. We went to the bar and played the Musk Game, where Troy was turned into Trevor.”<br />
 <br />
“I was just scoping you out. I needed to!” Troy insisted, looking at everyone, pleading. “He fell into Dolan’s trap!”<br />
 <br />
“Yeah, because you took my ring off of my finger!” Feng shouted. <br />
 <br />
Everyone gasped.<br />
 <br />
“I’m over it now, but don’t you fucking dare paint me as reckless or dangerous. You transformed me and forced this confrontation with the Dolans-putting us all in danger-because I wasn’t putting out.”<br />
 <br />
Everyone looked at Troy, who looked angry and cornered.<br />
 <br />
“Fine! I took your fucking ring because you’re a controlling monster! I just wanted you to love me!” Troy bellowed.<br />
 <br />
“Troy,” Rusty said, trying to calm him down. <br />
 <br />
“So what?” Troy whirled on the room. “I have a moment of weakness and I’m the bad guy? He’s forcing me to take a whole bunch of risks for a fight I don’t give a shit about! I just want to be rich and young and not have to deal with bullshit! He turned me into a goddamn dog, then took me away from Darryl. That wasn’t enough, he needed me to be more under his thumb, so he made me old, and guess what? I fucking died!”<br />
 <br />
They stayed silent.<br />
 <br />
“Now I’m a Phoenixkin, which should be the coolest fucking thing in the world, but I can’t even enjoy myself or have fun being special. He takes away my childhood-one where I can actually be a cool kid who has money that everyone envies. I wanted to experience that. But I can’t. I can’t fall in love with anyone else, I can’t enjoy a childhood, I can’t, I can’t I can’t…Fuck you Xarxos! Fuck your stupid bullshit plans! Take your goddamn Books, I’m done!”<br />
 <br />
Troy threw his bracelet at Feng’s feet and stormed out the door into a silent hall.<br />
 <br />
“I think you just got divorced,” Rex said.<br />
 <br />
“Shut the fuck up Rex,” Feng growled and picked up the bracelet, slipping it on his arm. “I have to find Troy before he gets killed.”<br />
 <br />
“Um,” Todd swallowed, I’m just going to turn your clone back now, okay?”<br />
 <br />
“Yes.” Feng said shortly, then paused. “Wait a minute-”<br />
 <br />
Todd pointed at the half-nuki’s discarded jockstrap. “Animate.”<br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
“You have the Book of Body?!” Rusty shouted as Mark finished transforming back into a fox. “Since when?!”<br />
 <br />
“Not just Body,” Todd said. “I’ve got the entire Book of Transfiguration. I’ve had it for a few weeks now.”<br />
 <br />
“But how’d you even get them?” Rok asked.<br />
 <br />
“In my timeline, you guys went to fight Dolan about a month ago,” the fox explained. “You lost, and Dolan froze you in time, effectively turning you into living statues. Xarxos somehow made it out with the books, however, and he brought them to me. Prime Dolan told me not to tell anyone about what books I had, but I’m not about to listen to that asshole.”<br />
 <br />
“He wanted you to keep it a secret?” Feng asked. “Why would he not want us to know what books you have? It’s not like we can do anything with them.”<br />
 <br />
“Maybe so other guests won’t get any ideas and try to steal the books?” Mark suggested.<br />
 <br />
“I hate to interrupt,” Rok interjected. “But this conversation is better discussed somewhere private when we’re all together. Where’s the Xarxos from your timeline?”<br />
 <br />
“I…I’m not sure…” Todd replied. “The last time I saw him, we were all leaving the magic show to go and explore the casino more. Mark, have you seen him?”<br />
 <br />
“No, I haven’t seen him either,” the white-furred fox said, shaking his head. “Maybe he lost track of time and he’s still exploring the casino?”<br />
 <br />
“It’s possible,” Rok said. “But if he’s anything like our Xarxos, then it’s doubtful.”<br />
 <br />
“We can focus on that later,” Feng said. “Right now, I think we should change Xavier back into…whoever he was before.”<br />
 <br />
Xavier’s eyes widened. “H-Hey, come on now!” the stag said, giving the group a nervous smile. “You don’t honestly want to lose a loveable southern boy like me, do you?”<br />
 <br />
“After the stunts you pulled, it won’t be much of a loss,” Rusty said. “Now just hand over the ring copies.”<br />
 <br />
The stag sighed in defeat and reached for his left hooflet to take the fake rings off…but they weren’t there. Concerned, Xavier reached into his pockets, frantically feeling around for them. His hand brushed past his cock, which began to plump. By the time he pulled his hands out, his crotch was bulging tightly.<br />
 <br />
Unbeknownst to everyone in the room, the walls of the bathroom began to shift, tile transforming into old wood planks. Overhead, the lighting changed from fluorescent to dangling bare bulbs as the ceiling rose further up. The bare blue and green tiles on the floor flattened and lost color, becoming bare concrete.<br />
 <br />
“Come on, stop wasting time!” Rusty groaned, adjusting his package, which was feeling tight in his dress pants. “Just give us the copies!”<br />
 <br />
“Th-They’re gone…” Xavier said, sounding panicked.<br />
 <br />
“Oh, sure they are,” Mark said, rolling his eyes and shifting uncomfortably in place, his pants squeezing his genitals uncomfortably. “Unf! Just give us the damn rings!”<br />
 <br />
“No, I’m serious!” The stag held up his hooflets before turning his pockets inside out to show that he didn’t have them. No one noticed the threads of his jeans unravel until he stood naked, dark-mottled cock and plump black balls exposed, swelling larger with every second. His shirt began to unravel, threads disappearing as he spoke. “I had them a second ago! They must’ve fallen off when I lost my legs!”<br />
 <br />
“Guys, I think he’s telling the truth,” Todd said, his clothing beginning to evaporate, huge horse cock plumping and dangling between his legs. A stream of urine erupted from its tip, splashing on his legs and pooling around his paws. He appeared undisturbed by this change and continued talking. “I don’t see anywhere else he could hide them, and there’s no way he could’ve changed them into something else without one of us seeing him do it or hearing him use a spell.”<br />
 <br />
“Fine, we’ll go outside and check,” Feng said, scratching his enormous package and waddling to the door, the increased weight forcing him to hold it to walk normally. “Rusty, don’t take your eyes off of him, okay?”<br />
 <br />
The canine nodded his heads in understanding, moving behind Xavier, whose body was swelling with muscles, as the group walked out of the men’s restroom. However, none of them were prepared for what they saw waiting for them on the other side.<br />
 <br />
Instead of the casino, a wide, dirt-floored arena greeted them.<br />
 <br />
Beyond the open double-door at the far end of the arena was a grassy pasture. They could see horses grazing on a hill in the distance. Behind them, the door shifted to match the double doors at the far end of the area, revealing the bathroom as it finished shifting into a huge stable.<br />
 <br />
“Guys, something’s different,” Feng said, scratching the fur on his growing pec as it shortened and thickened into horsehide. “We’re in the middle of a reality shift.”<br />
 <br />
“What’s changed?” Xavier snorted, tossing his growing mane, not noticing as his muzzle elongated, his eyes bulging and spreading to the side of his face.<br />
 <br />
“The casino’s a barn now?” Todd frowned, his fox tail receding and long coarse hairs blossoming from it. His new horse tail flicked at a fly that landed on his back.<br />
 <br />
They were all nude. Which was, of course, as they always were. Horses didn’t need clothes, after all. That thought troubled Todd. Wait, were they always horses? He whickered in fear, nudging Mark, whose changes had progressed much further than Todd’s.<br />
 <br />
“Ah, looks like my newest racehorses have come!” An anthropomorphic horse walked out of the stables, pitchfork in hand and a piece of hay clenched between his teeth. “Dolan told me ya’ll be comin’. Name’s Chawhee. How’re my newest studs doin’?”<br />
 <br />
“S-studs? This isn’t-Ungh!” Feng grunted, tail lifting and horse turds tumbling from his puckering black asshole. He shifted on his paws as their nails thickened, going faintly numb, then merged into wide hooves. He teetered, off balance as his legs lengthened, and his hind end grew perfectly round with muscles and fat. His horse cock dangled to the floor and let loose a stream of piss. As the piss slowed to a trickle, he relaxed, relief clear on his face. “Ah, man, that felt good! It’s, um….”<br />
 <br />
“Oh yes, you’ll be making a fine stud horse.” Chawhee grinned and approached Feng, tossing aside the pitchfork and producing a brush from his pocket. “They warned me two of you have enough Books to resist this. I’ll have to help you along.”<br />
 <br />
Todd backed away from the stable hand and Feng, unsure of how to fix this. He knew he must be the other one Chawhee had referred to. He looked around, hoping someone else had managed to shake himself out of the reality shift’s allure.<br />
 <br />
Rusty and Rok were off in one corner, eating hay. Rusty’s heads had merged into a heavy horse head, eyes dulling. Rok was already on all fours, mostly fully formed into a horse. Mark had given in immediately and trotted over to Todd, standing next to him protectively. Perhaps some part of him was still in there, a lingering thought or instinct that told him they were lovers.<br />
 <br />
Rex had suffered the same fate as Mark had. He pranced out to the pasture. Todd saw his upper lips raised and realized he had scented mares in heat. There was no one left to save them…except, well him.<br />
 <br />
Not for the first time in the evening, Todd wondered where the hell His Xarxos had gone. A Mass Dispel would be extremely useful right about now. He no longer had a phone to text him, it had broken down into its base components and disappeared back into the stables.<br />
 <br />
Feng was backing away awkwardly on heavy hind legs, holding himself off the ground using the arena&#39;s walls. The changes were progressing up his backside, stomach bulging as more organs began to fill it, expanding to fit his new body.<br />
 <br />
“Here, let ole’ Chawhee help you out.” The stable-hand gentle pushed on Feng’s back.<br />
 <br />
“Wait, stop!” Feng scrambled to gain purchase on the wall, but his hands had fully formed into hooves.<br />
 <br />
“Shh, shh, shh, I got you, boy.” The stable hand smiled and noticed a gleam on Feng’s wrist-his Book. “Let me help you adjust.”<br />
 <br />
Feng gave a whinnying cry as the Horse-anthro unclasped the bracelet from his wrist.<br />
 <br />
“There we go, let’s get you down, boy,” Chawhee grinned, tucking the bracelet safely in his pocket and increasing the pressure on Feng’s back.<br />
 <br />
Feng slipped off the wall and fell forward, catching himself on his hooves, the bones in his arms lengthening. He felt a pop in his lower back and a crack in the bones of his waist, and no matter how hard he tried, he simply couldn’t bring himself to fully stand again.<br />
 <br />
The stable hand was at his heaving sides, brushing him, making soothing nonsense sounds.<br />
 <br />
Feng wheezed as his chest barreled out. Each pass of the brush shifted the color of his hide from dull chestnut brown to the glistening midnight black, mane flowing and luscious as Chawhee worked his way from his tail to the base of his mane. It was finishing him up, perfecting him, muscles bulging in the proper places<br />
 <br />
The stable hand moved up to his neck.<br />
 <br />
Feng tried jerking away, but Chawhee was surprisingly strong. He muscled Feng’s head into the proper position and stroked the brush across his neck.<br />
 <br />
“Please, you gotta stop!” Feng protested his neck popping and growing longer, muscles growing as it grew longer and longer. “You gotta-Neirggh!”<br />
 <br />
“Stop? You’re going to be the prettiest Arabian Stallion in the world! Your sperm will cost thousands.” The stable hand smiled, looking into Feng’s eyes as they grew larger. “You’re going to be very happy here.” He said solemnly, no trace of a lie in his voice. “I promise.”<br />
 <br />
Feng stared at the stable hand, eyes wide in terror, as Chawhee started brushing down his forehead. Without his Books, he was helpless. This was the end for him. He could feel his skull beginning to change, his vision moving as his eyes started to relocate to the sides of his head.<br />
 <br />
He flung his head out of the way, ducking the brush and shoving the massive horseman away.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee chuckled, dropped the brush, and lunged.<br />
 <br />
Feng tried to jerk his head back, but the horseman was big and fuckin’ jacked. The stable hand caught him in a headlock. Feng tried to squirm free, but the arm tightened around his neck, squeezing his carotid, and he had to stop or he was going to pass out.<br />
 <br />
“There, there, calm on now,” Chawhee said, then shoved his hooved fingers into Feng’s nostrils.<br />
 <br />
It hurt, and Feng tried backing up, but his big horsey rump bumped into the arena wall and he couldn’t seem to move sideways. Chawhee rotated his fingers and the pain and tightness ebbed away, his nostrils relaxing and flaring. Feng could suddenly smell all the scents in the arena-the other horses, a few mares in heat…<br />
 <br />
Feng’s upper lip lifted nostrils flaring wide as the smell hit him. Chawhee removed his other hand from the soon-to-be stallion&#39;s neck and shoved it in his mouth, his hooflets pinching and rubbing Feng’s teeth. His lips became rubbery and black, little bristles emerging around them.<br />
 <br />
By the time Feng came to his senses, blocking out the smells that had his huge horse-cock swinging out of his sheathe, his whole face was engulfed in a warm and pleasant tingle. He used his bigger tongue to cautiously explore the hand in his mouth. His lips felt thicker, his teeth large and wide.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee noticed awareness returning to the transforming man and removed his hand from Feng’s wide mouth, wrapping his arm back around Feng’s neck. Then he used his other hand, the one whose fingers were still in Feng’s nose, took a moment and splayed his fingers, forcing Feng’s muzzle to grow wider and broader. Then he hooked his thumb behind Feng’s teeth.<br />
 <br />
He pulled.<br />
 <br />
Feng gave a high, strangled whinny as his face stretched forward like taffy. His skull and jaw painlessly altered shape with tiny pops and cracks. His eyes resumed their movement to the side of his head. He could feel his mind begin to simplify, his skills and knowledge fading as his brain shrank and restructured.<br />
 <br />
The growing horse’s struggles grew more violent as he felt his past begin to change. But Chawhee’s grip never wavered. He just pulled at a slow, steady pace. The dome of Feng’s skull began to flatten, the ridges of his brow growing more pronounced.<br />
 <br />
Feng tried to fight the creeping dullness of his thoughts, but Chawhee kept pulling and even his memories of having been changed began to fade. New memories, ones of training under Chawhee, and total obedience replaced them. Feng felt his cock *thump* pleasurably against his belly, scattering what little thoughts he could gather. Being obedient was good. He was a good horse.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee continued stretching the Arabian’s muzzle further and further. He smiled as he watched the large eyes dull, irises doubling in size, leaving very little whites showing. His smile widened into a grin when he heard the tell-tale thumps of horse masturbation.<br />
 <br />
“There you go, boy.” Chawhee encouraged, still stretching out the muzzle. Not much further to go, very little resistance was left as the bones reassembled themselves like a puzzle. He’d intentionally gone slow, letting the obstinate stallion feel it.<br />
 <br />
Feng’s thoughts were in a daze, everything centered on being a good horse, and *thump*<br />
 <br />
Being loyal to his master-*thump*<br />
 <br />
The dome of his skull was almost completely flat now, and the horsey-man was speaking to him, but he didn&#39;t understand his words.<br />
 <br />
He could-*thump*<br />
 <br />
Feel himself getting close-*thump*<br />
 <br />
So pretty-*thump*<br />
 <br />
Good horse-*thump*<br />
 <br />
Feng felt like he should be afraid of losing himself, but all he felt was a pervasive sense of cottony contentment.<br />
 <br />
Lip raised, Feng, let out a whiny and allowed the contentment of being an animal to fill his mind. As his mind gave up, the last of his resistance fading, there was a pop as his skull finished restructuring. It was so pleasant a feeling that he orgasmed, mind blanking out and never returning as his cock began unloading wad after wad of hot stallion cum onto the ground below.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee felt the muzzle reach its full length and the horse’s eyes dull just as its cock erupted, splattering the ground with some very expensive horse seed.<br />
 <br />
“There we go. Good horse!” Chawhee grinned as the stallion nuzzled his hand. “Very good horse!”<br />
 <br />
He wished he’d thought of catching the sperm before it had hit the ground. He had a collector on him, but he had idiotically forgotten it in his excitement at changing someone. He bent down and scooped up the chips that had fallen out of the horse and pocketed them.<br />
 <br />
Todd watched in horror as the beautiful Arabian stallion whickered and nuzzled the stable hands head, tail flicking. He could see his chips as they rolled out of the horse’s ears and landed on the sands below. Chawhee picked them up and stuffed them in his pocket. He gasped, seeing other chips there.<br />
 <br />
His friends were gone, all horses, most trotting out into the pasture to graze. Only Mark stayed at his side, snuffling his hair and lipping him affectionately. Todd absentmindedly reached up and stroked the stallion’s neck for a second before he realized what he was doing and withdrew his hand. Mark didn’t seem to notice, resuming sniffing his boyfriend, not a thought in his feral eyes.<br />
 <br />
“Looks like we’re down to one.” Todd heard Chawhee say and realized his time was up.<br />
 <br />
Todd backed away, bumping into Mark.<br />
 <br />
“It’s okay pretty fella.” Chawhee raised his brush. “You want this or the milker?”<br />
 <br />
“Milker?” Todd asked.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah, it’s what we use to collect semen from horses. Come here bud.” Chawhee grinned, pulling out a tube from his bag, a long sleeve with a suction pump at the end. “You’re gonna love this.”<br />
 <br />
Todd swallowed, tears rolling down his face, and stepped awkwardly towards the stable hand.<br />
 <br />
“Hey, the horses are the only ones who should have long faces,” Chawhee said softly, hoofed hand reaching up and brushing away Todd’s tears. “I’ll be gentle if you behave, okay? You’ll just slip away with all that cum. Bracelet.”<br />
 <br />
Todd hesitated, but a stern look from Chawhee made him pull it off and hand it to the horseman.<br />
 <br />
“There ya go.” Chawhee smiled gently, stroking Todd’s tear-stained cheek. “You’re gonna be a big, strong Clydesdale. We have a wagon ride through the fields during Halloween and a sleigh ride in the winter with the snow we create. You’ll be pulling it, doesn’t that sound nice? Giving people rides?”<br />
 <br />
Todd found himself leaning into the horseman’s hands and nodding along. It did sound nice. The stable hand reached down and slowly fondled Todd’s genitals. Todd felt himself come erect and with a practiced movement, Chawhee slipped something over it, something that felt a lot like a condom, filled with lube that oozed around the base at it covered his cock completely.<br />
 <br />
“Good boy!” Chawhee praised him, flipping a switch. The sleeve began to suck and vibrate, the little ribs moving, making Todd’s cock twitch with unexpected pleasure. “Such a good, big boy!”<br />
 <br />
Mark had followed him to the stable hand and was now very interested in Todd’s growing flanks. Chawhee noticed the horse’s interest. Todd wanted to say something to him, shoo him off, but the automatic jacker on his cock started into a pre-programmed pattern, making him shudder and a low whinny escapes from his mouth.<br />
 <br />
“Looks like you’ve got yourself a boyfriend, huh?” Chawhee grinned, fingers going to Todd&#39;s ears and tugging them up, easing them into the proper shape.<br />
 <br />
Then, once Todd’s ears were complete, he lowered Todd to the ground.<br />
 <br />
Todd could only watch as he lost feeling in his fingers as his paws turned black, thick keratin building up around them. The changes and the pumping of his cock felt good, and he lost himself in the pump and suction of the autojacker for a moment. When he returned to his senses, he saw that the fur on his wrists had feathered around his ever-enlarging hooves.<br />
 <br />
Strangely, Chawhee was nowhere to be seen.<br />
 <br />
Then he felt his tail being gently moved aside.<br />
 <br />
Three thick-completed digits eased inside Todd’s rear. The ring of muscle pulsed and twitched under Chawhee’s touch, it was reshaped and remolded, thickening and squeezing it into a much larger hole than he’d naturally have. It was tough and leathery, yet soft and flexible, like pleather.<br />
 <br />
The hooflets went deeper, his hole stretching pleasurably as Chawhee stuck his whole hand inside. Todd suddenly felt nauseous and an odd fluttery sensation filled his anus. Suddenly he could feel the insides, there were smooth muscles there, and he could feel something forming deeper inside. The more Chawhee dug, the more sensitive his asshole became, and with the suction of the jacket, he almost came right there.<br />
 <br />
Todd chuffed and stamped his hind hoof in pleasure as he felt his hole become oddly slick, swollen, and sensitive. A strange heat welled up inside him. Chawhee pulled his arm out of the newly formed ass-womb.<br />
 <br />
“It’s okay boy, just making you more receptive to your boyfriend,” Chawhee said from somewhere behind his ever-growing body. “You’ll be working double-duty.”<br />
 <br />
He felt the horseman’s hands move to his cheeks, massaging the muscles with his stiff hooflets. His ass grew thicker and fatter with every tug and squeeze. Todd felt far more sturdy and stable, the massage growing more pleasurable the longer it went on. The fingers left, leaving Todd wanting, his anus winking and dribbling a clear fluid.<br />
 <br />
A finger swiped across his highly sensitive entrance, making Todd shiver.<br />
 <br />
Todd wanted to look and see what was going on, but he couldn’t even crane his neck far enough. He thought he saw the stable hand wave his juice-soaked hand in front of Mark’s nose. It wasn’t until he felt an immense weight settle on his back, forcing his still-growing front half to the ground, that he realized Mark was going to fuck him.<br />
 <br />
The stallion prodded, trying to find Todd’s entrance. Then he felt the tip of the thick, flared horse-cock stretch his new hole and whinnied. The cock began to piston in and out of his slick walls, making Todd clench his new muscles in pleasure.<br />
 <br />
He felt so full, the stallion’s cock shoving itself in deep and hard. It struck his prostate over and over again with each thrust. A steady stream of pre was tucked away in a whirr by the device, slowly filling a collection chamber.<br />
 <br />
Todd was struggling to hold himself back from cumming when he felt hands on his autojacker. Chawhee was doing something, fondling his balls. There was a welling heat inside and Todd swore he could feel them swell even larger.<br />
 <br />
Another hand stroked the base of the autojacker and shoved it further down. Another inch of cock meat found itself inside the jacket. Todd wondered where it came from, as the device was already firmly sitting at the base of his cock. Chawhee pressed the device further and further down, and Todd shuddered as five whole inches of brand new dick filled the Jacker, widening out until it fit the entire circumference of the machine.<br />
 <br />
The autojacker changed its pattern, starting to ripple and pulse. Todd moaned, wondering why he couldn’t cum, though he so badly wanted to. Chawhee walked back around him, rubbing his hands over his chest. It grew wider, barreling out, thick with muscles and fat. His touches continued down his shoulders and legs, and soon Todd had the strength to stand on his hooves while his lover took him from behind.<br />
 <br />
“You’ve been such a good boy!” Chawhee cooed and dug into his pocket and produced a sugar cube. “You’re going to be a big producer.”<br />
 <br />
The horseman rubbed Todd’s neck as he strained towards the sugar cube in his hand. Neck bones popped as his neck stretched a foot to the palm of Chawhee’s hand. A rub from the horseman’s hooflet and a mane grew from his neck, long and cream-colored. His hide was shifting from orange to amber-colored, and soon he was towering over the stable hand.<br />
 <br />
He finally reached the cube of sugar and lipped it from the horseman’s hand. It tasted nice and sweet as he’d never had sugar in his whole life. The effort had taken a lot out of him. He wheezed and let the suction of the jacket and the steady humping of his boyfriend in his sensitive hole wash through him.<br />
 <br />
Todd let his head drop over Chawhee’s shoulders, too exhausted and pleasured to do anything but seek respite.<br />
 <br />
“There, there, big boy,” Chawhee smiled, patting Todd’s neck. “Almost done now. Just let all those thoughts get sucked away.”<br />
 <br />
“You aren’t…” Todd rolled a thicker tongue around in a mouth too small for it. “Going to stretch my face?”<br />
 <br />
“You want me to, Bud?” Chawhee asked softly, gently stroking the side of his face, Todd’s jaw creaking and stretching under his touch, facial features starting to distend. “Want me to give you a nice stretching?”<br />
 <br />
“B-Bud?” Todd asked, working his sore jaw.<br />
 <br />
“That’s your new name, Bud.” Chawhee leaned forward and kissed Todd on the lips.<br />
 <br />
“I…” Todd licked his lips as they plumped and blackened, little bristles springing up around them.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah?” Chawhee encouraged.<br />
 <br />
“Stretch me.” Todd managed.<br />
 <br />
“Okay, Bud,” Chawhee whispered. “All you have to do is deep-throat this.”<br />
 <br />
Chawhee unzipped his pants and his huge, equine erection sprang out. A strong barnyard musk wafted off it. Todd’s mouth watered at the sight of such a lovely-smelling member bobbing inches away from his face.<br />
 <br />
Todd’s rubbery lips stretched towards it on their own, and Chawhee’s hand guide his mouth onto it. At first, it barely fit, but after swallowing a load of precum, Todd’s mouth started to shift and change. It creaked forward another inch, widening as teeth grew larger and flatter, fighting for space in the crowded mouth. The more dick he took, the wider his face stretched.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee began to press down gently, forcing more and more cock into Todd’s mouth. At first, his mouth was able to keep up, but then he hit the medial rings. His tongue lapped around the cock and the downward pressure from Chawhee’s hand-built.<br />
 <br />
Then, with a pop, the medial ring entered his mouth and hit the back of his throat. Todd’s eyes watered as he grew closer to the horseman&#39;s musky sheathe. His throat swelled wider, accepting the ring, but the ring flared wider, lodging itself there. Todd panicked, making gurgling sounds.<br />
 <br />
“Ready for it Bud?” Chawhee asked, hands positioning themselves on his head, getting a steady grip. “You’ve been a real good boy. After you foal, I think I’ll change you into my partner. Okay?”<br />
 <br />
Not waiting for an answer, Chawhee pulled.<br />
 <br />
Thanks to the flared medial ring lodged in his throat, his mouth stayed stuck in place around Chawhee&#39;s massive shaft. His face pulled upwards like taffy in the stable hand&#39;s grip. Bones creaked and lengthened, and the dome of Todd’s forehead began to slope. As his eyes bulged and grew large and dark, his memories began to fade.<br />
 <br />
As though sensing the shift, Mark began thrusting faster and faster, slamming into Todd’s prostate. The autojacker shifted into high gear, sucking and tugging his cock in tandem with the stallion’s thrusts. As Todd’s skull reshaped, his mind was filled with years of training and a growing feeling of contentment with his situation.<br />
 <br />
There was a gurgling from the machine as his mind was coaxed out of the tip of his huge cock bit by bit, swallowed up. His memories of going to the casino, of being human went first in a swell of precum that glugged into the milker.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee pulled in the same slow, inexorable manner as he’d done with Feng, letting Todd savor it.<br />
 <br />
Todd&#39;s love of Mark went next, whisked away with a suck and a whir of the cock sleeve. He managed a whicker of pleasure as the milky liquid was sucked out of him, eyes rolling<br />
 <br />
Chawhee stopped pulling and began fucking the horse’s face roughly.<br />
 <br />
“Fuck, you’re such a good horse!” The stable hand said, bucking wildly. “Such a-such a big, strong Clydesdale. Big and proud and hard-working.”<br />
 <br />
Todd grew even larger, almost twelve feet tall, more muscle and fat growing on his massive frame. The horseman’s cock started twitching and jerking inside Clydesdale&#39;s mouth, a torrent of cum gushing down Todd’s throat. In the throes of orgasm, Chawhee gave a great tug, and Todd&#39;s skull popped into shape.<br />
 <br />
His skull shrank instantly, forcing all of Todd’s thoughts to the only exit he had-his balls. His great balls churned and burned with heat as he reached his climax. They tensed and rose, and Todd threw his huge head back and whinnied as hot, thick cum burst from his flared cock head, gushing into the collector and filling the thing.<br />
 <br />
Behind him, Mark bit down on his neck and his cock flexed deep inside Todd&#39;s stretched-out hole. A blast of hot horse seed flooded his womb, then another and another. Cum oozed around Mark’s enormous mottled cock as it continued to buck and jerk, sending Todd into yet another orgasm, this one full-bodied. His mind whited out in bliss, the heat in his loins dying down.<br />
 <br />
Cum squelched around the base of the collector sleeve as the machine was overwhelmed with all of Todd’s thoughts. It began dribbling down his balls, which sloshed heavily with even more seed, semen that was still being sucked out. Soon, nothing was left of Todd, the final bit squirting out when his cock gave one last twitch.<br />
 <br />
Three chips rolled out of the huge Clydesdale’s head. The other horse, which it knew vaguely as its mate dismounted and nipped it playfully on the shoulder and pranced away. The horse made to follow it.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee grinned and picked up the last Chips. He tucked his flaccid horse-cock back in his pants. Maybe he could make it a threesome. <br />
 <br />
“Looks like you got properly studded, boy!” Chawhee laughed, seeing cum dribble from bud’s hole. “Nice and well-seeded. Gonna give you some teats when you foal, okay?”<br />
 <br />
The Clydesdale nuzzled his master affectionately.<br />
 <br />
“Thatta boy.” Chawhee stroked his muzzle and gave him another cube of sugar. “Don’t mind if I breed you now and then, do you?”<br />
 <br />
He chuckled as the horse lipped him again and turned to walk back to his office and inform the Dolans of a job well done.<br />
 <br />
The wall of the arena exploded, shrapnel flying. Horses screamed and panicked, running out of the arena into the pasture. Chawhee stabilized himself by hanging onto the big, beautiful Clydesdale.<br />
 <br />
“Dispel!” A voice boomed.<br />
 <br />
Todd gave a whinny, body shrinking and compacting, orange and cream fur poofing. By the time he hit the ground, he was back in anthro fox form. He lay there panting, watching as Chawhee unspooled a length of rope and formed it into a lasso, spinning it over his head.<br />
 <br />
“Fireball!”<br />
 <br />
A fireball caught Chawhee straight in the chest.<br />
 <br />
Todd dove for the floor as another ball of fire barreled past, striking the horseman just as he was recovering. The smell of burning hairs filled the air as the stable hand stumbled back from Todd. The horseman looked up, hatred clear in his eyes. Todd followed his glare to a figure who was silhouetted in the new opening in the wall of the arena.<br />
 <br />
His Xarxos.<br />
 <br />
The huge fox glared back at the horseman and turned to Todd.<br />
 <br />
“Gather up your friends. Hurry!” His Xarxos said nostrils flared in anger.<br />
 <br />
“What about him?” Todd asked, hand on his Book.<br />
 <br />
“He’s a fight. Get them all back into the stables. Now!” His Xarxos bellowed.<br />
 <br />
Todd nodded and ran round past Chawhee, who was focused on Xarxos, twirling the lasso over his head. Somehow, he needed to round everyone up. And he had zero experience with horses.<br />
 <br />
He glanced back once, seeing Chawhee and Xarxos battle it out, the horseman trying to lasso the fox. Todd was pretty sure what would happen if Xarxos was caught. He hurried, gathering the stray horses.<br />
 <br />
It turned out to be relatively simple. Just whistling brought the horses running to him like well-trained dogs. He walked back towards the barn, clapping and encouraging them to enter.<br />
 <br />
By the time he got back, a charred form lay huddled on the ground. Xarxos lay next to it, panting, greasy soot covering him. Chawhee was dead.<br />
 <br />
Todd grimaced, leading all the horses inside.<br />
 <br />
“I, uh, didn’t know who was who, so I just brought them all back,” Todd said apologetically. “They’re well-behaved, I thought it would be, you know, harder.”<br />
 <br />
“Get inside too,” Xarxos ordered. “This place is an hour away from the casino, so you need to hold them off until I get back, got it?”<br />
 <br />
Todd nodded, stepping into the stables. Xarxos put everyone’s belongings into a makeshift bundle. Todd rolled his bracelet onto his wrist and looked up at Xarxos, who looked a bit panicked.<br />
 <br />
“I love you,” Todd said.<br />
 <br />
“You don’t know anything about me.” Xarxos grimaced.<br />
 <br />
Todd was perplexed by his response.<br />
 <br />
“Wha-?”<br />
 <br />
“Mass Dispel.” Xarxos pointed.<br />
 <br />
.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
 <br />
The stables shifted, growing hazy, before reforming into a bathroom. Everyone was reeling with the shock of the transformations. Todd dutifully handed their chips and Books back. Other people he didn’t know were staggering to their feet, clutching their heads. Todd felt bad for them because aside from becoming human, they were blanks.<br />
 <br />
“Why are we naked?” Mark asked Todd.<br />
 <br />
“The bathroom was a trap,” Todd explained. “It turned into a stable, and we were the horses.”<br />
 <br />
“Son of a bitch!” Feng kicked a trash can. “Todd, give us some clothes. Let’s kick those fucker’s asses!”<br />
 <br />
Five minutes later, everyone was clothed. They gave themselves a once-over in the mirror, Feng, and Todd preparing the spells they might need, going over the tactics. Then, as a group, they stepped outside.</p>
