<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Note: At this point, with the inhibitor chip destroyed, I am writing the main character as if he has forgotten his old identity, and doesn&#39;t even remember that he&#39;s wearing the clonesuit. In other words, he believes this cavegirl body is his own.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you roll around on the bed of animal pelts, pulling yourself into a more comfortable and upright position, the giant caveman known as Gorr returns from the sealed entrance to his cave and sits across from you on an improvised chair of stone and hide. This is your first time seeing him clearly. He reminds you of a bear or an ape, a thing with a big head and little brains, with a thick, bristly hide and massive, knotted muscles. He wears a collection of skins draped around his shoulders and his waist, and a necklace of animal teeth hands around his neck. From beneath his heavy brow and his long stringy mane of dark hair, his coal-black eyes peer down at you with something approaching excitement and his oversized jaw is fixed in a dopey grin.<br />
You realize that in your current position, with your legs splayed out, you&#39;re giving him a full view up your short toga, revealing your bare pussy. He leers appreciatively and you quickly close your legs, scowling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh! New wife head hurt?&quot; He grunts.<br />
You&#39;re about to snap at him, but your head is still ringing and you know you&#39;re still too woozy to fight back.<br />
You simply nod.<br />
<br />
The dumb brute fishes around in the meager collection of possessions littering his cave, mostly earthen pots and crude stone tools, then produces a large clay bowl, filled halfway with some kind of purple liquid. He holds it up to your face, and you immediately feel the fumes burning your nostrils.<br />
&quot;Eugh! What this?&quot; you choke, scrunching up your face.<br />
&quot;Special wine. Gorr make. Very strong.&quot; Gorr grunts proudly.<br />
He places one massive hand on the back of your head and simply says &quot;Drink.&quot; before roughly tipping the bowl into your mouth. You choke and gag, only swallowing about a mouthful, and spilling a bunch of the acrid liquid all over the cave floor. Even from just a mouthful, you can tell the stuff is strong.<br />
Gorr laughs as you hack and spit, attempting to get the bitter taste out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
He reaches forward and attempts to massage your arm with his massive calloused hand, but you slap it out of the way, with as much disgust as you can muster.<br />
&quot;O-ho!&quot; he laughs, &quot;You not fight Gorr. You Gorr wife now!&quot;<br />
You&#39;re tempted to scream in his face and reach for the nearest improvised weapon, but you quickly realize that there&#39;s no way you could fight this giant of a man. &quot;Gorr not smart. Me trick him.&quot; you think, glancing around the cave for ideas. All you can really see are basic items for meal preparation, a simple campfire under a small hole in the roof that must act as a chimney, surrounded by bundles of herbs and withered root vegetables.<br />
The lingering aftertaste of the foul wine gives you an idea, but you&#39;ll have to be subtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gorr hungry?&quot; you ask, trying to sound as sincere as possible. His expression changes to one of surprise and relief. He pats his stomach and smiles, nodding enthusiastically.<br />
&quot;Me Gorr wife now, me cook for Gorr.&quot; you say, bringing yourself to your feet and making your way over to the crude kitchen.<br />
&quot;Ah! You good wife!&quot; he laughs.<br />
&quot;You lie down, me cook.&quot; you say. Gorr nods and lies down on the bed of animal skins, folding his arms over his chest and smiling blissfully at the cave ceiling.<br />
<br />
While he rests, you get to work, expertly striking a flint over the fireplace as if you&#39;ve done it a thousand times before, then placing a piece of earthen cookware over the crackling fire. You take a crude knife, more like a barely-sharpened rock, and chop up the vegetables before tossing them into the pot. Soon you&#39;ve created a basic vegetable stew, which you take off the fire and allow to cool for a while. Checking to make sure Gorr isn&#39;t watching, you begin to add your special ingredient, tipping the bowl of wine into your crude meal and pausing every so often to grind up a fragrant herb in order to mask the smell. <br />
&quot;Mm. That smell good.&quot; he grunts.<br />
You pick up the pot and take it over to Gorr, who quickly sits up to admire your handiwork. He drools a bit as he stares at the aromatic dish.<br />
&quot;Me hope Gorr like.&quot; you say, trying your best to play your part.<br />
He grunts appreciatively as you hand him the entire pot, but then looks puzzled. &quot;Wife not eat?&quot; he says.<br />
&quot;Me cook special meal for husband Gorr,&quot; you reply, &quot;Husband eat first.&quot;<br />
He seems very pleased to hear this, and begins to hungrily eat the stew without any utensils, simply tipping the pot back and gulping it down like an animal. You fetch the bowl of wine and return to him, and he scoops you up with one of his giant gorilla arms, placing you on his lap as he continues to eat. Fighting back the urge to punch his stupid face, you offer the wine. &quot;Husband drink?&quot;<br />
He grunts and nods, pointing to his mouth. You realize that he wants you to feed it to him. Forcing yourself to smile, you tip the bowl into his mouth. This continues for a while, Gorr gulps down mouthfuls of the wine-infused stew, then pauses to let you tip some more wine into his mouth. Soon the effects begin to make themselves known. You can feel him beginning to sway, and his eyelids look heavy.<br />
<br />
The caveman places the now-empty pot on the ground and belches appreciatively, patting his stomach. <br />
&quot;Ogh... Gorr leave no food for wife...&quot; he slurs.<br />
&quot;Wife happy. Gorr like wife&#39;s meal.&quot; you reply, as he smiles drunkenly.<br />
&quot;More wine?&quot; you say, offering the bowl, which is now nearly empty.<br />
He simply takes the bowl out of your hands and places it among his other belongings.<br />
&quot;No more wine.&quot; he says, looking at you with sleepy, half-lidded eyes and an idiotic grin. His breath reeks of alcohol.<br />
&quot;Gorr want wife.&quot; <br />
With that, he hooks  a massive finger around the top of your toga and pulls it down, causing your breasts to spill out.<br />
You quickly cover your chest and giggle, while internally you feel like puking.<br />
&quot;Wife want Gorr too. You lie down.&quot; you instruct him.<br />
The drunken caveman fumbles clumsily with the animal skins tied around his waist, eventually managing to pull them off and revealing a thick cock, erect and easily a foot long. You realize if this plan doesn&#39;t work, he could tear you apart with that thing.<br />
He takes his position on the bed of animal pelts, lying comfortably on his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me need pee first.&quot; you say. &quot;Where I go?&quot;<br />
Gorr grunts and points to a clay jug, his arm swaying erratically.<br />
&quot;Me not want husband see.&quot; You say, sheepishly.<br />
He grunts again and points to a little alcove in the cave, a short dead end that would give you some privacy.<br />
You nod and take the clay pot, then disappear into the alcove. Then you just sit down and wait.<br />
And wait a bit longer.<br />
Soon, you hear heavy snoring, and you know that your plan has worked.</p>
