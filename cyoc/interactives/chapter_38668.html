<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam crouched down, looking at Jenn.  &quot;Okay, I promised so.  Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenn barked, but something didn't feel right, the answer had always felt final before, now it felt wrong.  Jenn barked again, and Sam just kept staring at her.  'Why isn't he responding.. he must know too.  Damn, he can't understand me.'  Jenn was in a panic she kept barking and barking, growling in different ways to try and sound the word, and finally, a terrible feeling came over her.  A minute had passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Jenn, but I couldn't understand your answer, so I guess you're stuck with both, don't worry, it'll be okay, I won't be mean to my former master.&quot;  He smiled, &quot;Well, you would ignore me, I was more your brother's.  Now that I think about it, you hit me with rolled up newspaper sometimes, and all I wanted was a belly rub.  I think I'll make it so you can't ignore me.  With this human brain, I finally just realized how mean you were to me.  We're going to fix that.&quot;  Jenn shook her head, this couldn't be happening, this stupid dog was going to do something else and she had no way to stop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transform, you're going to become my identical twin brother and best friend.  Except me and you, no one will know it was any other way.  Your dare is, you will have fun and enjoy being my friend and brother as much as I enjoy it, and would never do anything to hurt me, and since dogs are still pack animals, and I still think that way, I'm going to have a lot of fun with it, nor would I ever hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenn was furious, she couldn't be this dog-come-human's twin brother instead of his older sister.  Something gave her a start, her room was changing, the decor was going from something very pink, Jenn's favorite color, to blue.  Her four poster bed was replaced with something more boyish, and her vanity turned into a top line stereo system.  Her computer became more top line, and all her posters changed to cars and sports.  Looking around no one would think anything other than a teenaged boy lived in here.  A door appeared in the wall that ajoined this room and what was once the office, a similar room on the other side, Sam's.<br />
<br />
Sam just looked around.  &quot;I guess it wanted to make sure it was ready.&quot;  Jenn quivered with anger, wanting nothing more than to tear out Sam's throat, but the thoughts were soon replaced with those of brotherly love.  This guy in front of her was her best friend, she wouldn't think of hurting him.<br />
<br />
Jenn's body began to contort.  Her hid legs stretching and taking on a more human shape, her feet growing back out.  Her hips realigned allowing her to stand up straight.  He spine slowly moved back into position as the hair on her body retreated back into her skin.  Her torso became distinctly more human, as he arms reformed to their old shape.  Finally her head and face readjusted.  She looked to the mirror and sighed, she looked like her old self, naked but still herself.  Her relief was short lived as she noticed her blond hair turning brown and retreating into her head until she had the same spikey do as Sam.  She felt a pressure between her legs as a pair of large testicles dropped out from her sealing vagina.  Her clit began to grow and lengthen, swelling to the same well endowed cock between her new brother's legs. Her torso began to reshape, her feminine curves being replaced with a more blocky male physique.  Her shoulders bacame broader as her breast began to retreat, shrinking along with her nipples to a more male proportion.  Her thin body soon swelled with some lean muscle, making her look like a runner.  A fact soon confirmed as a few track and field awards appeared on one of the walls, she knew that same happened in Sam's room for some reason.  Her blond pubic bush turned a dark brown, becoming bushier as it spread out.  A good deal of hair grew down her legs, a dusting of brown hair sprouting on her chest and abs.  Finally a shadow grew on her cheeks and jaw.  The family pictures in the room all glowed and changed, all the ones of her became ones of the twins, and any of her with the family replaced the old her with the new.<br />
<br />
Jenn looked at Sam, and held up her hand, the two went through a series of hand slaps that both seemed to just know.  &quot;This is going to be fucking awesome.&quot;  Jenn's new slightly deeper voice sounded exactly like Sam's.<br />
<br />
Sam laughed, &quot;You know it.  Now, I say we use the curse you have to wreak a little of the havoc that Sam and Jake Smith are known for.&quot;  Jenn, or rather Jake, knew it too, they were mischievious.  Not really bad behaved, but certainly fond of the occasional prank, which they more often than not got away with.  Inside what was left of the old Jenn wailed, she couldn't believe this is how it could happen, she tried desperately to think of something, but it was soon quashed as the personality of Jake finally took her completely over.<br />
<br />
Jake leaned in &quot;This is my idea.&quot;  he whispered something into his twins ear.<br />
<br />
Sam just smiled. &quot;Just what I was thinking.&quot;</p>
