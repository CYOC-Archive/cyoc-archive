<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
You have no idea how or why you grabbed the Karbie costume, but you carefully hung it back on the wall, grabbing Ben&#39;s instead. <br />
<br />
Hurrying back to the dressing room. You just needed to try it before Jess came down, then you could take it off really quick and suggest it as a cure. <br />
You sat down on the provided dressing room bench and were about to take your shoes and skirt off when you remembered they were magic, you shouldn&#39;t need to. <br />
Well maybe just the shoes. <br />
You kicked off your kicks, and slipped your legs in with just socks. The rest seemed to happen automatically. <br />
Somehow the costume was in one piece, the plastic wrapped around you like a vault. Your vision went dark for awhile, then you opened your eyes.<br />
<br />
Woah.<br />
<br />
No longer was fem cat boy John. Instead was... <br />
Earring Magic John?<br />
Well it was supposed to be, you reached for your ear but was disappointed when you had to flick the top of your head again. Your human ears were still gone. <br />
That didn&#39;t make sense. <br />
How did human + maid + cat + boy + &quot;Ben&quot; still equal cat ears?<br />
<br />
Except. They were blonde now. Because you were blonde now. Like 90s early 2000s bleach platinum blonde. One of your cat ears was pierced with extremely cheap and disproportionately large silver plastic. A like-colored blonde tail still swung behind you, but thicker and shorter. <br />
You stood up, looking at your whole body. <br />
Your eyes were still blue, but you didn&#39;t see any cat slits in them. It seemed like you had a fake spray tan on. You had almost an identical body to a life-sized doll. Except maybe a little more lithe. Must have been the remaining femininity coming through. You were still pretty slender but definitely man. Kind of like a model or hot anime boy.<br />
<br />
But most excitingly, you were back to your original height! Maybe even taller?<br />
 <br />
You could jump for joy as that&#39;s what you primarily wanted. You been slightly afraid you were going to end up as a literal doll on the floor or something. Flexing your fingers, you noticed a weird detail. You didn&#39;t have nails. It was just... finger. You hadn&#39;t realized how much you missed your natural broadness until now. You held out your arms, still hairless but definitely more muscular.  Actually it looked more toned than normal. Like you actually went to the gym. <br />
You pulled the vest back and examined your pecs and abs under the mesh. <br />
Huh... no nipples. Well it&#39;s not like you needed them. You rubbed your hand under your shirt, enjoying the feeling of skin and firmness in your palm. <br />
Really firm actually.<br />
<br />
Maybe too firm. <br />
Uh oh. <br />
You knocked on your chest, it sounding hollow. That&#39;s weird, it didn&#39;t FEEL hollow. And the rest of your body still had some give to it when you squeezed. <br />
<br />
Hm, ok maybe not the perfect solution, but it was definitely still an improvement. <br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t wait to tell Karbie- wait you meant...<br />
You couldn&#39;t wait to tell Jess.<br />
She wouldn&#39;t make fun right? You were a man again. What was there to make fun of?<br />
<br />
Maybe you could spend the month in this. <br />
You bet putting men&#39;s clothes on this wouldn&#39;t taint them with girliness. And you were a little excited about getting a new wardrobe and accessories together. (Each sold separately.) <br />
<br />
One of the things that had been bothering you the most in your previous form had been your unfortunate genitals. You bit your lip hopefully, pulling your pants taunt against a substantial bulge &quot;Ben&quot; &#39;s costume had. It didn&#39;t feel like you wore underwear anymore either. <br />
There was a hesitation, as you had always been taught to keep your underwear on in a dressing room, but ...<br />
<br />
You had been so sick of that sissy little 3 inch wiener you&#39;d been stuck with. All done up in lace and crap. It was gross. It wasn&#39;t even in style. You sat on the bench and pulled your pants down, wondering how big it would be. <br />
<br />
Then your stomach dropped. <br />
<br />
Oh. <br />
You blinked, just to make sure. <br />
There wasn&#39;t... <br />
A sharp intake of breath as you tried to assess what you were looking at. <br />
<br />
You rubbed your hand over where it should have been. Instead of a dick you just had... a lump? A bulge?<br />
Though, your skin was a little thicker than a real human&#39;s, this part didn&#39;t feel hollow either. You squeezed, and your face felt hot. <br />
<br />
Oooh.. It felt. It felt like your dick was inside... like your dick was inside a fleshy pocket, being squeezed around... But... <br />
<br />
&quot;H-how am I supposed to go to the bathroom in this...&quot; you whispered. You felt around, trying to feel for all your equipment. Squirming, as it felt like your balls were inside too. You felt ... bigger for sure. Just... underneath. <br />
You pinched, biting your lip so you didn&#39;t moan, ohh... it felt good. <br />
Good but a little frustrating. It was like you wanted a hard on but were being blocked. Squeezing in the back it felt like your balls were bigger than they had been prior too just... still stuck. You rubbed around, and could feel them squishing around inside and underneath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nng&quot; you put your hand to your mouth. Oh that felt really good. Maybe too good. <br />
You squished it all around again, smiling and quietly blushing. Or whatever doll-men did. Could you still blush?<br />
<br />
You wanted to jerk off so bad, pushing your hand into your crotch like you would if you were masturbating, but there wasn&#39;t much to grab. Just a mound to pinch and squeeze. You slipped down to your knees and tried to hump the bench. It was .. frustrating. <br />
<br />
You got the costume&#39;s hanger and tried to rub it against, that didn&#39;t do much either. <br />
You felt sweaty, well not really. You didn&#39;t seem able to sweat, but like mentally and emotionally sweaty. <br />
You rubbed plastic on plastic, trying to get it to work. Squeezing, pinching, rubbing. <br />
Edging. You felt like an edge machine but... nothing was happening. <br />
<br />
Was this just an oversized chastity belt or what? You reached up to rub a nipple and remembered there wasn&#39;t anything there either. It was like scratching an itch in the wrong spot. <br />
Damnit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nnng...&quot; you tried to imagine hot things, hot girls, your favorite magazines at home. But all you got was heavy throbbing in your crotch. That was still good though. You rubbed it more on the bench, enjoying the feeling. Panting a little bit. <br />
Come on....<br />
<br />
&quot;John?&quot; you heard distantly. Your cat ear pricked back as you heard your cousin on the other side of the store. <br />
<br />
Crap.<br />
You whimpered as this was cut short, but you were still horny as hell. Your boner was stuck in this stupid flesh pocket though. Oh but the flesh pocket felt nice... <br />
You bet you&#39;d be huge if you could just get it out of there...<br />
You snapped back remembering that your cousin was within hearing distance. <br />
Standing up you pulled your pants back on. Amazingly you didn&#39;t have a boner in the mirror. But it felt a bit like trying to tuck when being called up on stage or something. Still... throbbing. Fighting against the prison. You bit your lip, trying to get out of horny mode. <br />
Old ladies. Cold showers...<br />
<br />
You had to get this thing off too. She&#39;d see you and make fun or something. As stylish as you looked, you felt like she might not understand. And there was the off chance you might get in trouble. You didn&#39;t want to be at the mercy of magic users again. <br />
<br />
You reached behind you to grab the zipper and pinched. Having trouble. What the hell. Why weren&#39;t your fingers cooperating. <br />
You pulled your hand back in front of you trying to flex your fingers. But it felt like your fingers were suddenly stuck together with glue.<br />
 <br />
&quot;The hell?&quot; you tried not to panic, but the more you tried to separate them you realized they were stuck together like a doll&#39;s.</p>
