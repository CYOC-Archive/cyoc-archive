<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As ordered by Dr Eberheardt, the scientists in the observation room adjusted the family&#39;s hormone levels. The Merlin-5 nanites inside the Farlon family&#39;s bodies did their work. Cortisol and adrenalin levels were limited to keep the family&#39;s stress levels in check, while further below their bodies, testosterone and estrogen production ramped up. The genitals of the youngest subjects, Abby and Danny Farlon, were adjusted slightly, so that they fully functioned like an adults (though still child-sized)<br />
<br />
Merlin-5 also allowed for more specific behavior changes to the family, i.e. specific actions and habits. But those changes are currently on stand-by, in case the family did anything too drastic. Eberheardt didn&#39;t want to rely on it too much. Privately, she likened it to a game. Either the Farlons were actually willing in their own behavior, or they had to be mentally manipulated into compliance. <br />
<br />
Not that she abhorred the latter, but achieving the first part would be....satisfying. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have the fail-safe at any time,&quot; reminded Dr Adam. It&#39;s the protocol that would cause the family to freeze, or lay down on the ground motionless. Just in case the family did anything too rash or dangerous. <br />
Dr. Eberheardt watched the screen, as Cole Farlon helped bring their delivery from the room hatch to the dining table, right as Stephanie prepared plates. Little Abby helped lay out the knives and forks, while the youngest Danny stiffly poured himself apple juice in a cup. <br />
<br />
It was dinner time. <br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
&quot;More potatoes, Abby?&quot;, offered Cole. His daughter nodded, as he scooped some pieces of boiled potato and placed it on Abby&#39;s plate.<br />
<br />
Tonight, the scientist had left in the delivery hatch a platter of prepared steak and vegetables; apparently from the best meat the staff had available. On any other evening, it would&#39;ve smelled delicious, and the family would be treating it like a fine little dinner party. <br />
<br />
Cole honestly didn&#39;t give a damn, and neither did Steph. Right now, their biggest worries was avoiding arousal and hiding their attraction from their own kids. Cole kept crossing his legs, while Steph pressed thighs together tightly. <br />
<br />
Abby and Danny, unknown to them, were similarly distracted. Their kids were trying their best to eat normally despite the strange feelings in their lower bodies. Abby was sucking on her fork a little, which she stopped as her father noticed. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of silent eating, Cole found the silence too agonizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...did you kids enjoy the movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby perked up, as she chewed and swallowed her steak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah...&quot; she mumbled. &quot;It was weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot;, muttered her mother.<br />
<br />
<i>Fuck</i>, thought Cole, as he realized they were thinking of that first movie. &quot;I was talking about Despicable Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...yeah, it&#39;s ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was another awkward silence, as the family ate. Danny was stabbing at his carrots idly, and Steph took a rather big sip of water. Abby kept twirling her fork. <br />
<br />
God, I need to blow a load right now. Cole thought of that dream again, of his co-worker, and that monstrous cock flopping out his own pants. He was never into men, so why the hell was he thinking of-<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;, asked Cole Farlon, as his wife startled him out of his fantasies. Steph gave him a knowing glance. <br />
<br />
Oh damn it, Cole thought, as he realized his erection had grown. Abby and Danny hadn&#39;t noticed, thankfully.<br />
Cole shifted in his seat, hoping to cover himself. Instead, his legs bumped together, and shook the table. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Ah!&quot;</i>, Danny piped, as his cup of apple juice toppled, and spilled over his pants and shirt. Danny jumped up in shock, as the liquid dripped all over his legs and clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; said Steph, as she left her seat. &quot;Here honey, lemme clean you up-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m okay!&quot;, Danny shouted, as he pulled back from her. Steph stepped back in surprise. Abby looked at her little brother, in concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can use the towel!!&quot;, said the boy. Cole didn&#39;t notice the boy was trying not to sound pleading. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny dashed off towards the bathroom. Abby stayed behind, looking at her brother go. Cole sighed. &quot;Guess he needs some space, huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get him some clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steph walked over to their kids&#39; bedroom. The scientists allowed for all the clothes their family brought (they even provided some spares), and Steph had them folded in their childrens&#39; closet. <br />
<br />
This left Cole and her daughter sitting alone, with an even more heavy silence. Abby pushed peas around with her fork. Cole picked at the last remaining scraps on his plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...ok there, pumpkin?&quot;, Cole asked.<br />
<br />
Abby looked up. He wasn&#39;t quite sure of her little girl&#39;s expression. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled, wearily. His pants were still bulging under the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; <br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Danny locked the bathroom door, as the young boy quickly stripped off his wet pants, dropping them both on the cold white tile floor. His small tighty whiteys, which were also wet with apple juice, was tenting outwards obscenely.<br />
<br />
Biting his lips, Danny pulled them off too, and his erect penis popped out like a little flagpole. He didn&#39;t know why his body was doing this. Or why he liked touching himself down there earlier, or why he liked seeing that weird tree-lady in the cartoon with the boobies. <br />
<br />
But it made Danny feel nice. Thoughout the whole day, he had thoughts and daydreams about turning into weird things, and just thinking of those things made his dickie go harder. Was it this strange &#39;experiment&#39;? He imagined evil scientists doing wicked things to him and his family, but why would they make him feel good? <br />
Danny worried. And yet, he stared down at his bobbing little member, and couldn&#39;t help but brush his hand on it again.<br />
<br />
His penis twitched, and his little ballsack churned. Danny caught his own breath. Somehow, he felt like his dick was about to do something big. But what? <br />
<br />
As he gave it another rub, he recalled the dream he had last night. The one he told everyone about, of him being a car.<br />
<br />
Yeah...Danny remembered now. He was on the street outside their old house, running after a basketball he accidently threw out of their yard. But when he ran after it, he suddenly flopped onto the ground. <br />
He saw himself, like a video game character, with his body going big and metal-like and his hands and feet going round and rubbery. He couldn&#39;t remember what happened to his dickie, but it was exciting!<br />
<br />
And his butt. Yes, his butt grew big, red and shiny with lights on each buttcheek! And Danny saw his butthole turning into several pipe thingies where smoke comes out of at a car&#39;s end. His head, it grew big! He remembered himself smiling, as his mouth and nose stretched into a big grill, and his eyes turned into glass lights, while his back grew a big hump with windows. He was stuck, heavy and he couldn&#39;t move, but he loved it! <br />
<br />
And then, he remembered everything looking like a beachside with tall beach trees. There was a bunch of grown-up girls in small swimsuits, all climbing and sitting atop of his big, shiny metallic body. And there were grown up guys there, and they were kissing atop of him, and-<br />
<br />
<b>KNOCK KNOCK</b><br />
<br />
&quot;Danny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny held down a shocked yelp as he heard his mother&#39;s voice. &quot;Danny, I have your clothes. Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you open the door?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shaking hand, Danny reached out at the door handle, and turned it. The lock clicked open. <br />
<br />
&quot;C-Can you just give it?&quot;, said Danny, as he slowly pulled the door open, with the rest of his small body hidden behind the door. He reached out his other hand. &quot;Just give me my-&quot;<br />
<br />
But right as he felt his hands touch his fresh new clothes, his hard penis bumped tip-first against the door. He felt its sensitive tip pushing onto the cold, painted side, pushing the head in like a soft, squishy button. Danny&#39;s voice broke at the unexpected pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...huh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Danny realised his hold on the door had gone loose, his mother swung in, causing Danny to step back. His mother&#39;s eyes widened in shock at the sight of his rigid privates. But Danny didn&#39;t even care. Something was happening! <br />
<br />
&quot;My dickie! It...it...<b>AHH!!&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Something squirted out. Danny cried out, and nearly fell back as his penis shot out squirt after squirt of hot, strange slime, splattering right on his mother&#39;s chest and face. The young boy gasped and shuddered at each spurt, his knees shaking as he struggled to stay upright. Danny was still throbbing as he saw his mom&#39;s look of frozen shock, as cum dribbled down her surprised face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Stephanie Farlon couldn&#39;t believe her eyes, as her son climaxed in front of her. This caused her own loins to spark like a struck match, and she had to hold back a moan of her own.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t think. All Steph could see was her son panting heavily, cum still spewing from his little member as he stood on trembling legs. She could taste it. Oh god...why was it so... <br />
<br />
Before she realized what she did, she gulped. And she felt &#39;it&#39; coming; a feeling she knew too well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh g-god- <b>AHHH!!</b>&quot;<br />
<br />
The dam burst. Steph&#39;s legs buckled as wet warmth gushed down her underwear and inner legs, while her hips shuddered. She moaned loudly, all while his own son was finishing his very first orgasm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...Steph. STEPH!!&quot;<br />
----<br />
Cole watched in utter disbelief, as his wife fell against the side of the bathtub, moaning and thrusting her hips while his son spurted off a load. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t get a word out. How...how didn&#39;t he notice Danny feeling this too? Oh god, this wasn&#39;t happening. This couldn&#39;t be happening! <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy? Danny?&quot;. Cole realized Abby was watching from right behind him. Her eyes were wide with shock, and worry. Fuck...he had to act!<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby, Abby! Don&#39;t look, go to your room! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly, his daughter hurried into his room. Oh god, was she feeling it too? He needed to stop this. The scientists. Those <i>god damned scientists...</i><br />
<br />
He was about to rush for the habitat&#39;s main door and the intercom, when his eyes glanced on his family again. He saw his son, his tongue panting out, with legs buckled into a near-squat. He saw Steph, now in a similar pose, with legs spread, and her cheeks and sweet lips dripping with saliva and cum. Her hair, frazzled yet beautiful like those nights on their honeymoon in Florida. Those hot, long nights-<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
All around the Habitat&#39;s observation room, there were chuckles and stifled laughter as the third member of the family broke into an unwanted orgasm. <br />
<br />
Eberheardt watched as Cole Farlon fell back-first onto the floor, thrusting his hips forth in a spectacular orgasm. Like her subordinates, she smiled at the sight. However, she knew it was soon time to intervene. No doubt this distressed father was about to confront the source of his family&#39;s torment. Even with the safeguards of Merlin-5, that was nothing to be taken lightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s pissed,&quot; quipped Dr. Adam. Sure enough, Cole was grabbing himself, and staggering back onto his feet, only to fall back down with loud grunting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trigger the failsafe,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;Have the handlers ready, we&#39;ll need to escort the parents to the interview room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Adam complied. He opened a nearby lid, and pressed onto a lit red button inside. <br />
<br />
In the footage, Cole suddenly calmed, and found himself going limp against the ground as his eyes went drowsy. The other members of his family did the same too; slinking into a slumber as their orgasms waned. Even Abby, who was curled up in fright on her bed, gently laid herself back before falling into a calm sleep. <br />
Once all Farlons were fast asleep, the Habitat door opened. And several men in full-body hazard suits walked in...</p>
