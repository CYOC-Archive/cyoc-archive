<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was absolutely freezing and there was nothing he could do about it.  He really should have expected another negative to pop up during his transformation, he really should have!  As soon as his brother dived into the water he was hit by a wave of freezing cold water.  He instinctively went to hold his breath, yet as Ryan swam Jeff realized that he didn’t need to hold his breath and became more focused on the sheer cold of the water.  It must have been because of his small size, but Jeff was feeling the cold which seemed to be 5 times more than normal.  His only saving grace was the steady flow of time where his brother would be out of the pool allowing for Jeff to get some warmth from the towel that Ryan would use.<br />
<br />
As the day progressed, Jeff watched the swim meet from his brother’s crotch.  Normally he wouldn’t go to Ryan’s meets for fear of staring and for just a lack of interest in the college itself.  No matter how much Jeff liked living in Gaines Hills, he was not fond of the university that accompanied it.  The programs were too focused on certain sports and the programs were more dedicated to business and law degrees, with everything else secondary.  Yet Jeff could admit, as he watched a few male and female swimmers walk past Ryan, that the view as a speedo did allow him a decent vantage point.<br />
<br />
The day’s portion of the swim meet passed by very quickly, much more so than Jeff could have imagined.  The only explanation he could come up with was that because of the rapid temperature changes along with the constant movement, Jeff lost track of time.  In truth, he was actually grateful for that as it allowed him to almost forget that he was around his brother’s waist.  Yet there were times where it was quite clear as to where he was.  Jeff would see someone pass by, usually a woman, and he would feel Ryan’s cock twitch.  Thankfully nothing came out, he really didn’t want that to be part of the experience.<br />
<br />
As the final race ended for the day, Ryan and his team mates made their way to the locker rooms.  He was so sore from the races that he had taken part in, he stretched his arms above his head causing Damian and Mike to both duck out of the way.  Kaito just shook his head as Aaron smiled and watched on as a couple new members chatted to each other.  Not everyone had participated today so they would be finishing up the races tomorrow, and the rest of the team was already looking forward to the end of it all.<br />
<br />
Making his way to his locker, Ryan began to open it up and take out his shower products when he heard Kaito start to speak.  “It&#39;s a relief that we’re almost done, I’m already beat.”  It was understandable, the Japanese-American had ended up doing almost all of his races back to back.  Anyone would be exhausted from that, and if Ryan had seen the schedule right Kaito still had one more race to do tomorrow as well.  Ryan himself had done two races today, and was due to do another two tomorrow and was looking forward to the rest tonight.<br />
<br />
“It’s your own fault for being able to swim in so many different categories,” Mike pointed out as he made his way to the showers.  “If you had just decided to specialize in one area like the rest of us, you would have had an easier time.”<br />
<br />
“You know that’s not always the best way Mike, we’ve been over this,” Ryan said as he hung his speedo up on a hook in his locker.  Wrapping his towel around his waist he turned towards the showers as well, “Besides it isn’t just Kaito’s fault.  Coach saw him when he first tried out, remember.  We all know how he can be.”  At that even Aaron grimaced slightly with the others, William Ryder was really dedicated and expected the same of them as well.<br />
<br />
As Ryan made his way to the showers, Jeff could only sit on the hook in the locker.  He had no idea if he was going to be left in here or not.  But he could only hope that his brother would not forget him after tomorrow’s races.  “Heh, this is going to be a long night.”</p>
