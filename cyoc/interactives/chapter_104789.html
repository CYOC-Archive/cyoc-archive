<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh... my that looks delicious,&quot; Dawn smiled as she licked her muzzle as Martha entered the dining room carrying two bowls of ice cream.<br />
<br />
The bowls were well filled with large round scoops of ice cream covered in chocolate syrup and even a small bit of cool whip on top. It wasn&#39;t quite what one would expect from a professional ice cream parlor, or even from a Diary Queen, but it did look good and the fully transformed vixen began to thump her tail against the chair. Martha heard both Douglas and her husband&#39;s own brush-like tails began to thump against the seat of their chairs as well as they eyed the bowl that Martha placed before Dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both can relax, there is plenty more,&quot; Martha said to them and placed the other bowl down in front of Douglas, &quot;I only have two hands and couldn&#39;t carry all the bowls at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very relaxed,&quot; William answered, &quot;Just eager for some dessert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you are,&quot; Martha gave a smile as she felt her husband&#39;s hand touch the swell of her hip and rubbed gently over her brown fur to get a feel of her butt as she turned to get her bowl and William&#39;s bowl. That made it clear that ice cream wasn&#39;t entirely the desert her husband wanted. That made her smile, and Martha felt the engine that was her libido begin to hum again. It was one of the things that she&#39;d really loved about her transformation, as not only was she completely calm with being bisexual, but she&#39;d gained the sexual energy to want the attention and keep it going. It was that had made her glad that the Hales had come over and they&#39;d had their day of sex. She might not have been able to get William down to Awareness to get some pants and things that could shift with him, but the day had still felt very good.<br />
<br />
That brought her mind back to many of the things that had gone on between William and her. His past unfaithfulness, which a part of her still felt that some of her repressing being bi had helped that along, and its consequences making them move. Now, that was all fixed and a distant memory. As a werecat, she could keep up with William and at every point where the idea of him falling back on his old ways came up, he did or said something that demonstrated his bond to her. That had done a lot to heal their marriage as William seemed to return to the same man she&#39;d fallen in love with and married, and in a way, he was even better than he was before. As a werefox with instinctive knowledge on how to please his partner, Martha had found the sex that she and William had had as werecat and werefox was far better than it had even been when they had first started dating. That had been most enjoyable, and her new libido loved it. In that sense it made William the only man she could ever want or need.<br />
<br />
There were some things that kept some of her old fears around. Some of that related to the sort of orgy that they had been having through the day with the Hales. She had seen some signs that William was interested in some of the things that Dawn had offered, but at the same time, Martha could see his bond there and standing strong. He looked as though he wanted to, but wouldn&#39;t if she didn&#39;t want him to. It might have been enough to make her want to scold him, but at the same time, she couldn&#39;t help but get the feeling that Dawn and Douglas were both interested in that and even interested in her. Which made her wonder on the nature of werefox bonds, if Dawn and Douglas were bonded and both were open to it. Dawn had assured her that the bonds didn&#39;t break. Things worked out well for her and Douglas because they seemed to swing that way. That was a relief to Martha, but William remained the only man she&#39;d ever need.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t as though Douglas was ugly, in fact he was far from ugly. Like any other male werefox, he&#39;d probably be able to easily get a job as  a male model. But, to Martha&#39;s eyes, he simply didn&#39;t compare well enough to William to really make her truly consider it. William was slightly more muscular and William&#39;s penis was bigger. She was more than willing to be with Dawn, but William remained the only man she&#39;d ever need.<br />
<br />
Martha collected the last two bowls and returned to the dining room. She handed one to William and moved to sit in a spot where she would be between William and Dawn. As she sat down, Martha&#39;s triangular ears picked up every delighted sound that came from the others as they ate from the ice cream that they had been served.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmmm... this IS good,&quot; Douglas spoke as brought a spoonful into his long pointed black furred muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ice cream is always good,&quot; Martha commented as took her first spoonful, &quot;The adding of chocolate syrup and cool whip is just a perk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever had home made?&quot; Dawn wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think my family knew some neighbors that made home made ice cream when I was growing up,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;It wasn&#39;t too bad if I remember correctly, but I&#39;ve never made my own ice cream. Lucerne and Blue Bunny have been my favorite brands for ice cream...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We generally haven&#39;t turned down generic brands, though,&quot; William commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is understandable,&quot; Dawn nodded and playfully sucked on the spoon.<br />
<br />
They enjoyed their desert, though as the four of them began to reach the bottom of the bowl, some thoughts did turn onto what to do next. Martha had some idea on what was wanted, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to be willing to go with Douglass, and for the moment, she also knew that they&#39;d all spent the day having sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was delicious, dear,&quot; William said to her and leaned over to lick her cheek, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured everyone deserved a little something sweet,&quot; Martha managed a smile.<br />
<br />
There was an almost awkward silence between the four of them before Martha decided to move the conversation forward and avoid getting them all going again. It might be fun, but then Dawn had also mentioned something of things other than sex to do in their were forms, and now with the sun down, they could take that outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you were saying earlier about being able to do things other than just sex while in our more animal like form?&quot; Martha asked to Dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dawn nodded, &quot;that can be quite fun, even if all you&#39;re doing is watching television or reading the paper... Our human forms... they&#39;re disguises, things we HIDE behind. This...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha and William watched as Dawn gestured to her furry body.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what we TRULY are,&quot; Dawn continued, &quot;and I feel very comfortable when I&#39;m like this, not matter what I&#39;m doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with the sun down, we can take that outside as well,&quot; Douglass added, &quot;romantic walks... games... there are quite a few areas where when the moonlight hits the tree branches just right... it&#39;s like being under the most romantic lighting imaginable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds lovely,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;Perhaps that should be the thing to do... Enjoy a nice walk. We can talk more about our loves and the joys we&#39;ve had with it... and families, and the great pride that&#39;s come from them. We can burn off some of the sugar that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha knew there were other ways to burn of the sugar, and a part of her mind even pictured their orgy resuming at this spot in the woods that was very romantic that Douglass commented on, but for the moment, she pushed that to the back of her mind.</p>
