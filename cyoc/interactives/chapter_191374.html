<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mirrors spun about Tommy, throwing a twisting and writhing reflection back at him as he knelt on the platform, every nerve on fire. He felt the pain surge in his hands and held them out in front of him. They grew larger in front of his eyes, his fingers growing big and thick, his palms becoming calloused. Did that mean he was becoming one of those slow thinking laborers? He hoped not, anything would be better than that. They didn&#39;t seem to have anything behind those almost blank eyes.<br />
<br />
The pain shot up his arms, causing them to almost instantly double in size. He hunched forward and planted his hands on the ground, gritting his teeth against the pain. He could feel his shirt straining against his swelling shoulders. Fabric ripped along the seams first, then fissures appeared in the cloth itself as the flimsy t-shirt could no longer contain him. He gripped the front of the shirt in one hand and tore it free with still growing arms, exposing swelling pectorals.<br />
<br />
He looked into the spinning mirrors, catching glimpses of his freakish appearance. The arms and chest of a bodybuilder on his short teenaged body. Maybe he could break through those mirrors and escape now. He tried pushing himself to his feet but unbalanced. His center of gravity all off and his top way too heavy for his legs to bear. He fell back on his ass with a wince. His chest was still ballooning with new muscle, the pectorals becoming large and round.<br />
<br />
Leather snapped apart as his sneakers blew out, his feet almost twice the size they had been.  Jeans began to rip and fray as his legs swelled inside of them. The cuffs pulled up, exposing inches of muscular calves before bursting apart. The button on his waist band when plinking away as it popped free. The seams up the sides slowly parted, exposing heavily toned thighs.<br />
<br />
As the denim fabric began to dig into his crotch as his ass and hips grew larger, Tommy ripped it free with almost dismissive ease. His underwear was strained at the limit, and his package seemed to be growing as well, pushing at the thin white cotton, pulling the waistband away from his skin. The growth from his legs and chest were meeting in the middle, his waist thickened though remained trim compared to the size of the rest of him, as his stomach began to tighten into a four pack, then six, then eight. Every muscle on his body was in stark definition.<br />
<br />
He could feel his neck begin to thicken, changing the way he held his head. It seemed like the mirrors were slowing down, or maybe he was just getting used to the spinning. But he could see his face slowly changing. His brow growing thick and heavy, his chin and jaw becoming large and squared. His shaggy blond hair grew out until it brushed his shoulders, wild and free.<br />
<br />
The elastic on his underwear finally snapped free, a thick meaty cock flopping free, six inches soft as it was, though he could feel blood rushing to it as the pain in his body was slowly shifting to an almost pleasure. His skin lost its pallor, developing a healthy sun-kissed glow. A slight itching started on his arms and legs as golden hair grew in on his previously mostly smooth body. More golden fur grew along his rounded pectorals and down his taught abs, highlighting the definition in his muscles rather than softening it.<br />
<br />
His face began to itch as a golden beard grew in, long enough that the bottom touched his chest. The pain was now completely pleasure, a warmth that spread throughout his body. He gripped his cock, which was now hard and stood a proud ten inches out of it&#39;s golden nest of pubes. Not even thinking about what had just happened to him he began to jerk off. His powerful new arm pumping furiously as he brought himself to a climax, the pleasure centering in his mind. He was what he was supposed to be now a voice whispered to him. Loyal to the circus and Master Az.<br />
<br />
He grunted as he came, shooting thick globs of cum along the mirrors as they truly began to slow. He dropped to his back, spread eagle as he panted heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up.&quot; Came that rich baritone. Tommy felt like he had to comply and got to his feet. His new balance was strange, he was so top heavy, but his legs were now thick enough to keep him upright. It still took a while for him to feel out his new center. He saw the mirrored door open in front of him, the laborer peering in, though Master Az stood in the entrance, looking pleased as he eyes Tommy. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy.&quot; It came out in a deep, gruff voice.<br />
<br />
Az shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s no name for a specimen like you. Almost godlike. Thorson, that is your new name.&quot; Thorson nodded. Of course that was his name. Had it ever been anything else?<br />
<br />
Master Az tossed him a bundle. &quot;Get dressed. We&#39;ll get you a proper costume later.&quot; Thorson pulled out a pair of shorts and a string tank he quickly changed in to. There were even a pair of sandals for his feet. He liked wearing as little as he could get away with. Why have a physique like his if he couldn&#39;t show it off?<br />
<br />
Tommy shook his head. No. This was wrong. He wasn&#39;t... Thorson grunted and forced the stray thoughts down. &quot;Follow.&quot; Az commanded and Thorson fell in beside him. Master Az was tall, but Thorson noticed he was taller. Still the man was intimidating, and he felt a need to do as he was told every time the Master spoke.<br />
<br />
He was lead to a large open pavilion where a bunch of the acts were sitting and eating. Some on benches, some on the ground. Like the centaurs who just had their legs folded up under them. The talking quickly quieted down as Az approached. &quot;This is our new strongman, Thorson. Make him feel welcome.&quot; Az turned and walked away, leaving Thorson standing there, frowning after him.<br />
<br />
He caught someone waving from the corner of his eyes, turning to see the centaur who was gesturing to an empty spot across the table from him, next to the acrobat. With no other options he made his way over there and sat down. One of those laborers appeared a few seconds later with a heaping plate of dinner for him. More than he had ever eaten in one meal before and quite protein heavy. Conversation started picking up again at the tables.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Cal, that&#39;s Fernando.&quot; The centaur said, nodding to the acrobat at the second name. &quot;Stick with us and we&#39;ll show you the ropes.&quot; Cal&#39;s human half was tanned, with brown hair and a neatly trimmed brown beard that matched his horse half&#39;s coloring. He was well muscled, though nowhere near Thorson&#39;s physique. Fernando was dark haired and lean, more cute than handsome.<br />
<br />
Thorson nodded dully as he picked up his fork. He could still feel something in his head fighting back, he pushed it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;That fog in your mind will clear up in a few days once the conditioning fully takes hold.&quot; Cal said, sounding sympathetic. &quot;Sorry, but, it&#39;s really not so bad here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thorson just shrugged. &quot;I...&quot; He clamped his mouth shut, then shook his head. &quot;It is what it is.&quot; Cal nodded as if that sentiment said it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, eat up. Then we&#39;ll find you a trailer.&quot; He looked Thorson up and down. &quot;Maybe a tent. You might be a bit cramped in the trailer for anything other than travelling.&quot; Thorson just nodded his thanks as Cal and Fernando resumed their conversation, they didn&#39;t force him to join in, leaving him alone to process what had just happened.</p>
