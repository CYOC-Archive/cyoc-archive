<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul just looks at Ben, suprised, and starts laughing. And laughing. Almost as if he is loosing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are joking! This is impossible! You are crazy! Quit acting so stupid and take those off!&quot; Paul yells.<br />
<br />
Paul tackles Ben and starts pulling the ears, pulling hard and yanking, plucking off the hairs. Ben is underneath, in pain and confusion, his arms and legs flailing.<br />
<br />
&quot;HE-HAW! STOP! THAT HURTS-HAW!&quot;Ben brays.<br />
<br />
Paul gets up and off, and starts laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quit pulling my leg! We both know you&#39;re acting! You should audition for a movie, maybe become and actor. If not any of those, maybe join a freak show!!&quot; Paul teased.<br />
<br />
Paul gets on the floor and mocks a donkey, putting his hands to his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw haw haw, I am a donkey! Roses are red, violets are blue, I know you&#39;re acting and so do you!&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a terrible joke, if not already a lie!&quot; Ben yelled defensively.<br />
<br />
Paul gets up, takes off a belt from his jeans and stuffs it in the back of the pants and gets back down. He moves the &#39;tail&#39; with his hand as he tells another insult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like my tail? Oh yes, it&#39;s made from premium fabric. You&#39;re not interested in that, I know, it&#39;s what&#39;s NOT under it!&quot; Paul said, a sneer on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grow up, Ben. You&#39;re acting like a little boy! If I kicked you between the legs, you would feel no pain becauae what you lack is MANHOOD!&quot; He said with a confident look, standing with his arms crossed.<br />
<br />
Paul balled up his fists and got on all fours. He began circling Ben as he mocked a donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! I can&#39;t write with these hooves! Look! I can punch the ground with my fingernail!&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
Paul was ready to get back up to mock Ben again, but for some reason he couldn&#39;t. There was nothing holding him down, but why couldn&#39;t he..?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sorry for mocking you... Could I get a hand here?&quot; He asked. <br />
 <br />
Ben sighed and went over to Paul, letting him pull on his hanr, yet he was still unable to get up. Ben let him fall to the ground, exhausted. In anger he scratches his itchy head, feeling two slight bumps at the top of his head. He itfhes and itches, and stops in fear of makingnit worse, like a mosquito bite. The bumps itch so bad he puts his hand over the bump. He eventually gets tired and releases his hand. The bumps spring up and reveal that they&#39;ve grown to four inches! Paul just ignores the stronger will to itch, allowing the bumps to grow more. The bumps grow hair on them, the same hair on Paul&#39;s head. The hairs are long and smooth, some though very light colored, short, and curly. After ten minutes, Ben adjusts himself and walks out of the building, locking himself out, and leaving Paul alone. A minute after, Paul reaches up to itch and feels that the bumps- are now high above his head. He takes out his phone and goes into his camera to look at himself- to find that he now has donkey ears- at the top of his head, and regular ears at the side of his head. He felt his new ear, stroking up and down. He tried scratching behind them, and found himself deep in pleasure. He felt something move up the sides of his head, and stopped to look in his phone again. He stopped in suprise- his human ears gone, a blank space. Where his ears were now covered in hair. Paul reassured himself that this was just a dream, and his donkey ears drooped down. He felt furious, and started pulling on his donkey ears. They were solid, and obviously not coming off the top of his head. He gave up. Unable to stand, he crawled around on all fours- until something stopped him dead in his tracks- he forgot to put his belt back on. As he reached back to pull his belt out, he felt something take the belt&#39;s place. He tried to pull it out, but every time he tried, he was stunned. He crawled around, and felt something snag the thing at the back of his pants. He looked, saw nothing snagged on, and kept crawling. As he crawled, he felt like he was barely moving. He looked back, and saw a buldge at the back of his pants, almost like a snake. He reached in, pulling it out. It felt as if it were stuck inside him, and this pleasured him. Pulling it out, was a hairless tail the same length of his belt, with the same shade of brown! He panicked, and sat down on it for a good 20 minutes, until lifting his behing off the weird thing. But as he looked back to look atnit, there it was- a brown, rope-y tail with a tuft of his head hair at the end.  As the realization hit, he was horrified at what waa next.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! I DO NOT WANT TO LOOSE MY HANDS!&quot; he screamed, and screamed. <br />
.<br />
Paul bucked around the storage on all fours, in panic, like a four-yearold. He eventually fell asleep, exhausted on the hard, cold floor.  He woke up on the floor,nhis hands in a ball. He tried to un-ball them, but found it impossible. He got up, ( Still on all fours ) and crawled around. He lifted his bottom up, only feeling his feet tingling. He felt popping in his ankle, and looked back- somehow he was barefoot and his big toes was moved up halfway to his knee! His Heel began to dissolve and his four toes began being comsumed into a black substand coming from under his nails! Brown fur began to spread up, and his legs thickened. Then his hips grew bigger, busting his pants open, and ripping his jeans to the floor. The brown fur went up his body. His clothes all fell off in shreds. His spine grew a black mane just above it and the brown fur spread to his arms. He sat and lifted his arm, as his thumb sshrank and went halfway up his arms. Hands becoming consumed in the black substance, he let tears fall. As the black fur spread to his head, the brown fur now everywhere except his face. <br />
&quot;HEHAW!&quot; he screeched. &quot;HEL-HAW! HAWHEHAWHEHAAAAAW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul bucked around the room until he clamped his teeth and felt his teeth grow. His back teeth becoming rocks..</p>
