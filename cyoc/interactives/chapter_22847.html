<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The bar sounds good,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Zach and Michael nodded and the three boys headed into the crowds and glamour of the island in search of one.<br />
<br />
Despite the crowds, it didn’t take them long to find a bar. The three boys all walked into it, finding it virtually empty. Zach and Michael led Jeremy to a booth, where they all sat down.<br />
<br />
“They’re going to kick us out,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
“Just stay cool,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
A young woman with long yellow blond hair that streamed over her shoulders approached the table. She wore a black tanktop that exposed her midriff, showing off tanned skin. Her black skirt left her well-shaped legs open for the world to see. She smiled at the boys, Jeremy noticed her teeth were perfect. He wished he were older so he could ask her out. The lad didn’t stop to consider where that thought came from, it was one that was far from normal for him.<br />
<br />
“Would you three gentlemen like some beer?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Her voice was pleasant, almost too pleasant. It was as though she were singing the question.<br />
<br />
The three boys stammered as though unsure how to respond to the lady.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we won’t ask for ID. Everything is of course, on the house. We want you all to have the time of your lives. Let go, have fun and go wild,” she said.<br />
<br />
Zach and Michael smiled at her and Jeremy found himself doing the same.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have a pitcher and three glasses,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
“Coming right up,” the woman said.<br />
<br />
She walked off and the boys all looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Man, I wish we were older; then we could ask her out!” Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, she was kinda cute,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy simply smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
The woman returned a few minutes later with a pitcher and three glasses. She put it on the table, smiled and told them to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Zach filled each of the glasses before handing them to Michael and Jeremy. Jeremy watched his companions drink. Their expression was of curiosity and then surprise. They put the glasses down when they’d drunk half of them and both looked at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“Give it a try, it’s not so bad,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy picked up his glass and brought it up to his mouth. The smell of the beverage was alien to his nostrils and he felt the fizz tickle his lips. He hoped that he wouldn’t like it and/or it would make him ill, then at least he’d have an excuse for not drinking any more. He drank down a small amount and swished it in his mouth for a while. Much to his surprise, it actually didn’t taste half-bad.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” Jeremy said after swallowing.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Zach asked.<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt something strange. Any worries he had over drinking it were vanishing. Nodding his head, he drank down more. He kept drinking until his glass was empty. Putting it down, he smiled.<br />
<br />
“That was actually pretty good,” Jeremy said. Instead of feeling ashamed, Jeremy actually felt good! He was already starting to feel a mild buzz and he wanted more. He poured himself another glass and started drinking it.<br />
<br />
“What did I tell ya?” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy finished that glass and a thought crossed his mind. He wanted to go to that beach. The idea that someone could catch him worried him a bit but if he was going to go this far, he might as well have gone the entire way. Besides, he knew he’d get into trouble for all of this eventually; from the lad’s point of view, he might as well make it worth it.<br />
 <br />
“I wana go to the beach,” Jeremy said. He’d already stood up before the others could respond. “See ya!” he said as he ran out the door.<br />
<br />
As he ran out into the warm sunny day, Jeremy felt a little strange again. He was starting to develop quite a buzz. Any worry that he’d get into trouble was quickly fading. This was already too much fun too worry about that!<br />
<br />
Jeremy ran through the thick crowds laughing all the way. He felt great and didn’t want the sensation to go away. He would normally never sneak into the girl’s locker room or anything like that. Now, on an island where anything went and there was little if any worry of getting into trouble, Jeremy felt freer then he had in a long time.<br />
<br />
As he thought that, he felt a strange sensation over his rear end. Something brushed against the back of his pants. He shrugged it off even as he felt a breeze somehow touching something behind his rear end too high to be his legs.<br />
<br />
Jeremy just laughed off the sensation and kept running through the crowds. He heard some of the people saying something about him but he didn’t care, he wanted to get to that beach and see the things society would never allow his eyes to see at his age.<br />
<br />
“This place is awesome!” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Why he was letting go so easily, he didn’t know. It felt great doing so, as though as long as here were here, he could act however he wanted. He felt like there was an animal inside of him just waiting to get out. This animal was untamed, perhaps a beast but free of human rules, regulations and the inhibitions that Jeremy now knew had kept him at bay for a long time.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna be free!” Jeremy yelled. He didn’t care that others around him looked at him with worried expressions on their faces.<br />
<br />
As he broke into a run, his skin felt itchy and his clothes seemed tighter. He scratched his chin and felt hair! Was he growing a beard already? Growing a beard meant he was truly becoming a man; not in a boring mature adult way but in a way that meant he could get away with doing things only adults could do!<br />
<br />
As he neared the beach, he felt stronger somehow. Jeremy looked at his arms only to see that his once tiny muscles were now almost bulging. Not only that but his arms, once only covered in a thin layer of light hair now had a much thicker coating of dark brown hair! Was he going through puberty this fast? Jeremy liked the idea of being one of the only, if not the only kid in his grade with body hair and muscles to boost. He didn’t care that the changes were seemingly impossible. He was too thrilled with them to worry about silly little things like possible and impossible.<br />
<br />
“This is so freaking cool!” Jeremy said. He noticed that even his voice sounded deeper!<br />
<br />
His buzz was starting to wear off. Jeremy saw a vendor seem to appear out of nowhere. No, Jeremy was just too distracted by these awesome changes to his body to notice! He ran right over to the vendor, a huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Hey mister, can I have some more beer?” Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
The man, a bearded man in his late thirties wearing a pinstriped shirt and pants, beamed at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“But of course young man. I see you’re becoming quite the man here!”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
The man poured Jeremy a glass of beer and handed it to him. Jeremy felt something swishing behind him. He knew he should have found it odd and investigated. However, he was feeling too exhilarated. Before he did anything else, he gulped down the beer, burping loudly afterwards. <br />
<br />
It all came to Jeremy naturally; he’d just followed what he wanted. This was a way of thinking alien to the boy. However, it was an enjoyable methodology.<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” the man said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded at him before running off. His clothes felt even tighter and his ears tingled. Sounds all around him seemed to explode. He could hear everything clearer and louder. Rather then worry, Jeremy only thought of it as a sign he was truly becoming a man.<br />
<br />
By the time he arrived at the beach, any anxiety had since flowed out of his mind. He could hear giggles from the girls, no women! He felt a lot like a kid who’d found his older brother’s adult magazines. He knew he wasn’t supposed to look at them. He knew his parents or brother could walk in at any moment and yell at him. This time however, he was free to do, as he wanted. There were no parents here to walk in on him. The truth was even if someone were to catch him Jeremy didn’t care.<br />
<br />
“This is gonna be awesome!” Jeremy said.</p>
