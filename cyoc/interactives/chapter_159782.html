<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah set it down, and noticed a small box beside it. The box looked much the same you would find with a ring in it for a special someone. He picked the velvety box up and opened it slowly. Inside it were two identical rings made in the same silvery metal that the belt was made of. &quot;What are these?&quot; Noah asked, looking up at the shopkeeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Those are energized nipple rings. When they are worn they not only make everything you feel from your nipples to be much more sensational, but they also increase the size of your pectoral muscles while attached.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah tilted his head to the side, looking back at the rings and gently turning the box this way and that to see them from different angles. &quot;Wait, did you say they increase the size of my chest?&quot; Noah asked, perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! The wizard who made them wanted his slaves to always be on display. He wanted them to be at the peak of their conditioning. It was with the sweat of their dedication that these rings were enchanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah continued to stare at the rings. He picked one up out of the box and carefully looked at it closer. &quot;But they don&#39;t have any opening. How are they worn?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper stepped around the counter and beside Noah. &quot;I will show you, if you purchase them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flushed with excitement, Noah agreed quickly, pulling out his wallet and handing the shopkeeper his card. One quick swipe later, the shopkeeper handed the card back and looked right at Noah. &quot;Do you still want to wear these rings? The magic in them will only work on someone who willingly agrees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah didn&#39;t hesitate. He quickly nodded and tried to step a bit closer to the nearby display stand to mask his growing erection from the shopkeeper. He pictured his already impressive chest swelling up even further. His hours at the gym and out on the field only being amplified further. A small wetspot began to form in his underwear as his member slid further down his pant leg. He couldn&#39;t wait to wear them. &quot;Yes, I want to wear them!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper smiled again, a bit longer this time. &quot;Alright, all you need to do now is take your shirt off and hold them up to your nipples. They will do the rest.&quot; He knew that he had the young man caught in his own pride and vanity. It would be his downfall.<br />
<br />
Noah took no time at all to quickly grab his shirt and tug it up and over his impressive shoulders, exposing his large pecs and cobbled six-pack. He then tossed it down on the floor beside him. He tilted his head to the left and right and shook his shoulders a bit due to the sudden chill of the colder air, causing his pecs to dance just slightly. He pulled one ring out of the box and held it carefully. There was an unexpected weight to it, as if it were made from something much heavier than silver. The ring itself had no seam or any blemish. The light shimmered off of its flawless surface. He raised it up to his nipple and with a quick static jolt, the ring had left his hand and was attached to his nipple. In doing so, Noah had closed his eyes and was briefly overwhelmed with a sexual energy surging from his nipple. A very quick moan escaped his lips which he tried to feign off by clearing his throat. His face was red with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper quickly stepped forward and grabbed Noah by both of his shoulders to catch him from the sudden sensations. &quot;Whoa there big guy. Easy does it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah nodded and regained his footing. He took the second ring out of the box. It almost felt like it was heavier than the first. Just like before, he raised the ring up to the tip of his nipple and inhaled briefly before touching it gently against it. Again there was a brief static shock as it attached itself which then was followed by a larger wave of sexual energy that pulsed outward from both of his nipples. This time however it was much more intense causing Noah to collapse down onto his knees, his eyes locked closed as he repeatedly moaned every couple of seconds. It felt like he was having the best orgasm of his life, one that kept going even after two solid minutes. He clenched onto the shopkeeper who steadied him until the waves past.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Noah, with each wave of orgasmic bliss came a swelling of muscle centralized in his chest and core. When he opened his eyes and looked down, his sweat-soaked frame was much more defined than before. Gone was the small trace of fat that shadowed his build. Where he had been impressive before, he was now much more refined and perfected. Noah laughed somewhat in shock and disbelief. He brought his hands up to his abs and felt the deep valley between each one as he slid up along them. When he reached the shelf of his pecs his eyes widened. They felt at least an inch further out than they had been just moments ago and much more firm. As his thumbs came up further, they brushed up against the rings and his downward facing nipples. Just a brief touch caused his knees to weaken again, forcing himself to brace himself. At the same time, his cock erupted into a stream of cum inside his pants.<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper, helped him back up. &quot;Well then, are they everything you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh these are great! Just... wow!&quot; Noah leaned slightly forward, winded and breathing heavily causing his now massive frame to surge up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need to be careful until you get used to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah looked up at shopkeeper, both of his hands braced on his knees while he was bent over. &quot;How long will that take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That entirely depends on why you put them on. Did you put them on for your failing relationship with Nadine? Or did you put them on for yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah paused for a moment, he reached up again and felt the extra heft of muscle each pec had to it. &quot;Well, I suppose I put them on for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you should get used to them in just a matter of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you uh...&quot; Noah paused, thinking for a moment. He did not want to randomly get off any time something grazed across his nipples or moved the rings. &quot;Do you have anything that can help me until then?&quot;</p>
