<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where were you born?&quot; she asks.<br />
&quot;In New Jersy&quot; you answer.<br />
&quot;Who was your best friend there before we moved?&quot; <br />
&quot;Johnny Smith&quot;<br />
&quot;Who was your first...&quot; she stopped, looking your body over once more &quot;girlfriend?&quot; <br />
&quot;Alexandra Martin&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;That's him, alright. No one would know that&quot; she said, looking at your dad. &quot;What gave you the notion to get into all this stuff&quot; <br />
&quot;It wasn't my fault!&quot; you say. &quot;They turned me into a girl after I was done without my consent. And if I don't go back, I'll be stuck as one!&quot; <br />
&quot;It's better than getting stuck as an article of clothing&quot; she said. &quot;I say never go back ther! Get all the legal stuff signed, and sue them! Then they'll be in prison, and atleast you'll still have a life! I don't want my son...daughter...child to wind up as someone's bra and never come back!&quot; <br />
&quot;I see your point&quot; you say. You look down, and notice that you're crossing your legs. Of course, you never did that as a boy. But now you were doing it without thinking about it. You uncross them. <br />
&quot;Son...&quot; she stopped. &quot;(Your name), let me help you. Your father and I have been in court before. We know the right lawers, and we know how to make it work.&quot; <br />
&quot;Let...me think about it&quot; you say. &quot;I'm not sure I want to give up all hope of turning back into a guy&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure honey&quot; she says in a soothing voice. &quot;Anyway, me and your father have some stuff to do. We'll be in town for a few more days. By the time we leave, just tell us what you've decided.&quot; she said. They both left.<br />
You fall down on your bed. Why did this have to happen? Why were dumb enough to go into that store in the first place. Now your a freak'n girl, and your whole life is flipped upsidedown. Your wearing a bra and panties, and this frilly skirt. You start to feel hungry...it is around lunch time. Remebering you have nothing in your fridge, you grab your keys, and (reluctantly I might add) your purse. You get in your car, and drive to Burger King again. Once you get out, your cell phone starts ringing. <br />
&quot;How to girls find thier stuff in this thing!&quot; you say, diggin through your purse, trying to find your phone. Finally you get it out, and aswer. <br />
&quot;Hello...&quot; you stop, &quot;I mean Hello&quot; you try to lower your voice.<br />
&quot;Hey man!&quot; you hear your best friend say. &quot;We're gonna go camping this weekend, wanna come?&quot; they ask. <br />
&quot;Ah...sure&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; he says. &quot;And man, what's wrong with your voice&quot;<br />
&quot;Aw *caugh* I got a cold.&quot; you say. Then you jaw drops. Coming down the sidewalk is your best friend and your buddies. Your best friend's on the phone talking. You can hear his voice in your ear. <br />
&quot;Oh...and where were you last night?&quot; he asks. <br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
&quot;You weren't at the gym&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh...yeah my parrents came over&quot; you say, thinking fast. <br />
&quot;I got go man, we're eating at Burger King. You wanna meet us here?&quot; <br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; <br />
&quot;Great! See ya there! I just saw a chick standing in the parking lot. I think I might go check her out.&quot; The phone went dead. Phew, at least you didn't have to try to cover it up anymore. You didn't know how long it would've been before he would've realized something was up. You hang your phone up, and put it in your purse. You turn around, to see your best friend.<br />
&quot;Hi...&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;Hey baby&quot; he said. <br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; you say, trying to sound like anyother girl. <br />
&quot;Oh...nothing&quot; he said. &quot;Can I buy you lunch?&quot; <br />
&quot;No thanks&quot; you say, rushing right past them. You buy your lunch and sit down. Your friends keep eying you, and laughing. You realize that if you were a boy and your were with them, that you'd be doing the same thing. Now your feeling it from the other side.<br />
&quot;I wonder where (your name) is&quot; said your friend. You can't take it anylonger. You get out of your seat, and walk over to their table.<br />
&quot;Hey baby, what's up?&quot; says your friends.<br />
&quot;Don't call me that!&quot; you say. &quot;Look, are you wondering where your friend is?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep&quot; he said. <br />
&quot;Well...I don't know how to say this...but...I'm him&quot; you say. There's a long period of silence, which was broken by them laughing. <br />
&quot;Good one!&quot; they said. <br />
&quot;No! It's true!&quot; you say, stamping your foot. &quot;Have ya'll watched the news recently?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; said one of your friends. &quot;The one about the manaquin?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah! Well they turned me against my will into a girl! Honest! Test me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, ok&quot; said your best friend. &quot;What day did we meet?&quot; <br />
&quot;September 21, 2009&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;When's my birthday?&quot; <br />
&quot;June 11, 1991&quot; you answer. <br />
&quot;And tell me the names of all of us&quot; you give each of their names. <br />
&quot;I believe you&quot; he said. &quot;Man...how does it feel to be...a girl&quot; he said. <br />
&quot;Horrible&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;Hey, you wanna come down to the gym with us?&quot; he says. <br />
&quot;Sure&quot; you say, feeling confident now that they believe you. <br />
<br />
You arive at the gym, and you enter with all your friends, feeling kind of awkward. You're wearing a skirt, and in no means the right outfit to work out. <br />
&quot;Let's go&quot; your best friend, who's name was Josh says. They all go into the room, and pick a different thing to start working out on. You chose some weights. You pick it up with your hand, and you can barely get it off the ground. <br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; asked one of the guys. <br />
&quot;I don't know!&quot; you say. &quot;The last time I was hear I could pick this up easy.&quot; <br />
&quot;Try the bar&quot; he said. You get down on the bench, and put both hands under the bar. You start to lift, but just barely get it up. You can't go all the way up as you could before. <br />
&quot;What the H3## is wrong?&quot; you say breathing hard. . Just then an employee came into the room. <br />
&quot;Ma'am, the girl's gym is on the other side of the hall way&quot; he says, pointing. Your friends crack up laughing. You blush, feeling embaraesed. You get up, and follow the man out of the room. Once you leave, you go into the girls gym You see two other girls doing weight lifting. You start curling a weight, which is much lighter than it is in the other gym. You do pretty much every exercize, adn then leave. You're soaked with sweat. Your friends are waiting out in the parking lot. They're shirtless, and also sweating. <br />
&quot;Hey man...I mean (your name).&quot;<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; you say, inbetween breaths. <br />
&quot;Well, ya'll want to come down to my place for the night.&quot; said Josh.<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; you say. <br />
&quot;C ya'll there.&quot; you all jump in your cars and drive down to Josh's apartment.</p>
