<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cathy grunted from her spot her head lolling about trying to find some relief from her stimulating clothes.  &quot;Nah ... not it!  I ... ooh ... can't move anyway,&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Naomi look at Jen.  It between them.  &quot;Jen, stop that,&quot; Naomi said sharply.<br />
<br />
Jen suddenly aware of why she was feeling so horny, pulled her hands away from herself.  Righting her clothing as best she could, she flushed with embarrassment even more than she was already from her fondling.  &quot;I don't want to.  I look funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Funnier than me?&quot;  Naomi did a little twirl to accentuate the fact that at the moment she was a rubber-fairy-princess-ballerina sporting basketballs for breasts.  &quot;You're easier to fix quickly.  I'll turn you normal-ish and you get the door, deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick question and answer while the door bell chimed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen you will regain your ease of moment and fingers and your skin will no longer look or feel like plastic but like normal human skin.&quot;  Naomi gasped.  The feeling of being caught was making making her hot.<br />
<br />
Jen watched her skin dull to a more natural pink though it remained flawless and smooth.  She felt her knees and hips and back loosen up then as she regained her flexibility.  Jen flexed her fingers as soon as they separated.  She felt over joyed to be able to twiddle her fingers.<br />
<br />
With her newly regained limberness Jen almost ran to the front door.  She hoped that she would be able to get rid of whomever was at the door.  Or at least that the other two would remain hidden in the kitchen.  Jen peeked around the curtain that covered the window by the door.  In the gloom of dusk she was able to see someone standing on the step looking about, obviously trying to decide if he should ring for a third time.<br />
<br />
When he turned once again Jen recognized her boyfriend, Dean.  He was early.  But with the craziness that she had just encountered she was willing see him.<br />
<br />
Jen un-locked the door, &quot;Dean!  You're early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got bored and came over.  There weren't any lights on so I wondered if you guys had left or something.&quot;  Dean stepped into the hallway tripping over Cathy's discarded bags as he took off his running shoes.  The light in the hall was dark as the sun had set a few minutes before and he could not see Jen very clearly.  &quot;I hope Naomi is not too weirded out by my coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, no.  She is cool with it.  Her sister came home for the weekend, too.&quot;  Jen took his hand and led him into the living room.  It was dark in there too and she wanted to inform him of the curse slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we all doing tonight?&quot; Dean asked.  &quot;You said something about a game on the phone.  What was that all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, listen carefully and keep an open mind,&quot; Jen said calmly pushing him onto the couch.  &quot;This morning some dickhead named Kyle cursed me.&quot;  Jen proceeded to give Dean a short recap of the day's events leaving out some bits.  She told him about the little agreement to use the curse for fun among the friends and asked Dean if he wanted to join them.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so magic is real and the Town Curse is real and you are now a hot Barbie doll?&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have to see this,&quot; Dean said gasping.<br />
<br />
Jen moved over to a lamp and turned it on.  In the diffused light she moved back to Dean and stood for him to look her over.  Which he did with much gawking.<br />
<br />
Dean was stunned.  Here was his girlfriend, Jennifer Smith, the hottest girl in school and she was now even hotter than before.  Her breasts were larger and her waist smaller and her legs stretched from there to forever.  Jen's hair was long and perfect.  Her face was sexy and finely sculpted.  Her lips were pert and soft and her eyes gleamed with beauty.  Dean felt himself go hard just by the was she was looking at him.  Her expression was still and sexy.  She seemed to be asking him if he was ready to have sex with her and the slight grin ensured him that it would be good.  The curse had done this to Jen?  Dean was all for joining in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy!  You really look great.  And nothing went wrong?&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that can't be fixed?  Do you like?&quot; Jen asked knowing the answer.  When she finished speaking her face went right back to the expression it had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you grinning like that?&quot; Dean asked.  He hoped the answer would be really good.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jen looked at her face in the mirror that hung on a wall of the room.  &quot;Damn, Naomi forgot to change that back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your standing on your toes,&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Oh, hell.  I guess that last one was a little rushed.&quot;  Jen tried to put her heels on the floor but was unable.  She could move her ankles freely but when she stopped her feet returned to the lifted position.  She would have to get these things fixed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Naomi, messed up?&quot; Dean asked.  He was eager to join the group but wary if things could go wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she did alright.  But you should see her.  That is something of a shock.&quot;  Jen laughed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly from the kitchen, there came the loudest scream and orgasm that had ever been made in that house.  The moaning and screaming continued for nearly a minute before Cathy, no longer frozen in place rushed out of the kitchen.  Cathy did not pause as she ran up the stair and down the hall to the bathroom.  A door slammed loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Dean asked meekly in the following quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um ... it means that the pizza should be here soon,&quot; Jen said.  Quietly she started to finger her slit through her shorts as she thought about the power of Cathy's scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to her?&quot; Dean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helped her with her research.  Dean, Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
