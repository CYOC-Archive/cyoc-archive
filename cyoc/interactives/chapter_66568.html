<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen smiled nervously, her face flushed with arousal, &quot;Are you sure you're alright in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Secretly she hoped that Amanda would ask her for help with her 'problem' despite being disgusted with herself with what she had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm fine,&quot; Amanda snorted before turning her attention back to masturbating her gigantic horse cock, &quot;I'll have this problem licked in no time at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
A shudder of pleasure ran through Jen when Amanda said her problem would be 'licked'. The though of Amanda wrapping her thick, equine lips around the flared head of her cock and sucking herself off was so hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jen stammered, realizing that she had to get out of there before she started masturbating as well, &quot;I'll go find Carly and Beth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoping that no one in the hall would see the way she was blushing she went over to wait by Carly's locker, hoping to meet her before class. When Carly didn't show up Jen tried the classroom where Carly had her first class and when that failed she went up to the second floor where Beth's first class was since Beth and Carly were usually inseparable. That too failed, not that Jen was looking too hard. After what she had done to Amanda she was making a point of not looking too hard at any of her classmates  for fear that she would start imagining them transformed by her perverted fantasies. It was all she could do to focus on other things, like how she hadn't done the reading for her first period English class.<br />
<br />
Figuring that it would give her a good excuse for not trying harder, she hurried to her English class and found that she was the first person there, something she was thankful for since with no other students around she wouldn't be tempted to start fantasizing. The professor nodded as she walked in, took her seat and tried to immerse herself in the reading assignment. For five minutes she managed to keep herself engrossed in the works of Shakespeare, then her classmates started to trickle in and it became a constant struggle not to think about them.<br />
<br />
The problem was that there were so many different kinds of transformation to think about, her new found perversion sparking her imagination in impossible ways. Any of them would be so hot to see.<br />
<br />
The clopping of hooves caused her to look up as Amanda tromped into the classroom moments before the bell rang.<br />
<br />
Beet red, Jen tried to turn her attention back to her book. Amanda was still a musclebound seven foot tall anthro Clydesdale, still naked, and still a hermaphrodite hung like a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't find them?&quot; Amanda asked as she walked by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Jen said quickly, trying not to stare at Amanda's wobbling basketball sized breasts or swinging balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad,&quot; Amanda snorted and tossed her head as she struggled to work her way into her much too small seat.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Jen Amanda was sitting behind her, so it wasn't like she could spend the whole class staring at her friend, yet at the same time Jen felt disappointed. She wanted to see Amanda's sexy, transformed body.<br />
<br />
That thought brought her back to her classmates. They could be transformed too...<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she hissed to herself, what she had done to Amanda was already too much. She had to resist.<br />
<br />
And so class began and before long she found herself lulled into a stupor by her professor's droning voice. She wasn't normally one for reading, but she did kind of like Shakespeare which made Mr. Hanks' knack for making everything boring especially frustrating. Her attention wandering, she looked at her classmates, again thinking about different transformations and how sexy they were. <br />
<br />
Eventually her gaze fell on Chris, the boy who sat next to her. He was looking away from her, staring at Cora, the girl who sat on the other side of him. More accurately, he was shooting sidelong glances at Cora's perky little b-cup boobs. That was too much for Jen.<br />
<br />
Realizing that there was no way she would make it through the whole class without starting to fantasize, she promised herself that it would just be Jimmy and that it was what he deserved. If he liked staring at breasts so much he might as well have a pair of his own.<br />
<br />
Watching him in much the same way he was watching Cora, Jen smiled and crossed her legs as Chris' nipples became visible, poking against the fabric of his blue t-shirt. He rubbed absentmindedly at them, pausing to pinch his erect nipples through the cloth. Realizing what he was doing, he put his hands down and sat on them, but kept looking at Cora. His nipples only pressed harder against his shirt as his chest began to swell out into a pair of breasts.<br />
<br />
Determined to make the change last the whole class, Jen struggled to keep things slow, focusing on Chris' budding breasts. They were already and a-cup, their roundness visible through his shirt. For a moment she considered changing his shirt too, to give her a better view, but thought better of it. The changes would be more exciting if she kept what he was wearing the same.<br />
<br />
Mr. Hanks continued to drone on, occasionally calling students to read a page or two if he felt that something was particularly noteworthy. Of course this haphazard reading only served to make the class more boring since being read in such a broken way did nothing to get across the merits of Shakespeare's works, especially when the professor was having them jump around from play to play.<br />
<br />
At one point Mr. Hanks even called on Chris to read a passage, though Jen had no clue what play it was from due to lack of context coupled with her lack of attention. The words went in one ear and out the other, for all her attention was on Chris. Mr. Hanks was big on having students stand up when they read, which was great since Chris was so nervous that he kept wiping his hands on his shirt as he passed his book from hand to hand, struggling through reading. This gave Jen a wonderful view of Chris' breasts, which had already grown to a b-cup like Cora's. Jen wasn't going to let it stop there though, Chris liked breasts so he was going to get a pair that would make him think Cora's were nothing and that was only going to be the start of it.<br />
<br />
Chris had reached the point where his breasts were starting to press hard against his shirt, lifting and stretching it and they kept on growing. He started rubbing at his chest again, this time to try and adjust his shirt over his breasts. One of the guys sitting behind him snickered and Chris turned to glare at him only to whirl around and slouch down when Mr. Hanks cleared his throat. Chris remained slumped in his chair until his ballooning breasts began to press against his desk, forcing him to sit up straight to be comfortable.<br />
<br />
When his breasts reached a double d-cup Jen decided that was enough. It was time to move on to the rest of his changes.<br />
<br />
Chris' features softened subtly, not exactly becoming feminine, but taking on a slightly more delicate appearance. His eyelashes were a little longer, his nose a little smaller, and maybe, just maybe, his lips growing fuller. The rest of his body became more delicate as well, his arms and legs becoming slender and his shoulders narrowing, causing his clothing to hang loosely everywhere but over his breasts. He tapped his slender fingers on the desk, his nails going from rough bitten to manicured, then he began to quickly write something in his notebook.<br />
<br />
Unable to resist, Jen stared at Chris' ass as it took on a bit of padding, becoming full and round, the perfect feminine butt. His hips widened to match, making it so that when he walked it would be with a feminine sashay.<br />
<br />
Chris finished what he was writing, tore it out of his notebook and passed it to Cora, who took it, read it quickly and rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
Dejected, Chris crossed his arms over his ample bosom and pouted. The guy sitting behind him who had snickered earlier leaned forward and pinched Chris' butt, causing Chris to blush furiously. Liking what she was seeing, Jen continued Chris' changes, causing his previously dark hair to lighten until it was blond, then start growing. It inched down past his ears, reaching shoulder length and beyond, finally stopping when it reached his ass.<br />
<br />
Now Jen decided that it was time to let his clothing change, first his pants tightened to better show off his shapely legs, a bulge in front showing that his cock and balls were unchanged, then his sneakers turned into sandals with a slight heel. His blue t-shirt turned pink and tightened over his breasts, before the neckline plunged down to better show off his cleavage. The straps of his bra, which did little to hide his big, perky nipples, were visible through his shirt. For good measure Jen made him shrink several inches so he would be more cute and feminine.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Jen smiled, that was hot. Chris had the body of a girl, but he still had a cock and balls. She had decided that he could keep those, unchanged, though by the time class was over Jen doubted that he would think of using them much. No, he was going to act like the girl he appeared to be, enjoying shopping, putting on makeup and flirting shamelessly with boys, in fact Jen thought that he might make a good cheerleader since if he joined the team that meant that she'd be able to watch him at practice with her and, even better, he'd change in the locker room with the rest of the girls, where she could watch him and stare at his totally hot new body.<br />
<br />
Chris' final few changes were taking place, his Adam's apple vanishing, his lips becoming full and pouty, pink lip gloss appearing on them as blush colored his cheeks and his already long eyelashes became even more lush thanks to mascara. <br />
<br />
The bell rang and everyone got up to leave.<br />
<br />
Amanda clopped out to find Beth and Carly, while Jen lingered behind to watch Chris, unable to conceal her glee when he hurried up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see what Greg did to me?&quot; he said in a soft, feminine voice, his hands on his hips in a perfectly girly pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what?&quot; Jen lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;He totally pinched my ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he is kind of cute,&quot; Jen offered.<br />
<br />
The corner of Chris' mouth twitched up slightly as he struggled to keep from smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lighten up dude,&quot; Greg laughed, managing to sneak up on them and reach around and give Chris' breasts a squeeze, &quot;It's just that I see that smoking hot ass in front of me and I forget myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny!&quot; Chris slapped Greg's hands away and smoothed his shirt over his breasts, &quot;You're such a jerk. I wouldn't date you if you were the last guy on earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool with me,&quot; Greg countered, &quot;I'm not into dudes man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, you keep telling yourself that,&quot; Chris giggled, &quot;You totally think I'm hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're crazy man,&quot; Greg laughed back, &quot;But seriously, I've got to run. Mrs. Shaw'll flip if i show up late to her class again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen and Chris watched as Greg hurried to his next class, they both had classes just down the hall so there was no need for them to hurry, something that Jen was happy about since it gave her time to admire her handy work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys are so weird,&quot; Chris said, rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jen fought back laughter, looking down at the crotch of Chris' jeans &quot;But you're a guy too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I totally forget sometimes, you know?&quot; Chris giggled, looking down as well, &quot;It really just gets in the way, all that stuff flopping around down there. I mean I can't wear skirts or panties, and in the morning it's like all 'hey, hey, I totally want some attention'. Don't even get me started on how it is when I'm talking to a really hot guy. Yuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nearly moaned at the thought, her pussy clenching at the thought of Chris with a raging hard-on visible through a silken nightgown. <br />
<br />
Misunderstanding, Chris blushed, &quot;I'm so sorry. That's like totally gross and I shouldn't have brought it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. It's fine,&quot; Jen reassured, not wanting Chris to stop talking about something so hot, but Chris wasn't listening to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just forget I said all that weird stuff, OK?&quot; Chris said quickly before hurrying into his next class. Several of the girls there greeted him and Jen could hear them begin to gossip.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, Jen went to her next class.</p>
