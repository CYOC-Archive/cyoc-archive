<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff entered his room and sat at his computer. He looked at the Chronivac. The message on the screen still blinked: <b>[Process Complete. What else would you like to change?]</b><br />
<br />
Changing his father had altered reality and trickled down to him. The real question was, did it do this consistently or not? He scanned the house and Dave and Finn popped up. If he changed Dave into something, Finn should, theoretically, become that. Reality should shift and no one should be the wiser. <br />
<br />
But what to change Dave into?<br />
<br />
And he needed to do something about Finn, too. He didn’t mind watching the game, but having to do it while seated next to someone being passive-aggressive with him really wore Jeff down. Jeff knew the most obvious thing he could do. Change Finn’s sexuality to gay. Didn’t necessarily mean he’d be nicer to Jeff. Sometimes people just didn’t like each other.<br />
<br />
But it would be hot.<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned and pulled up Finn’s profile. He altered his preferences to gay and hit <b>[Activate]</b>. The computer flickered and the loading bar quickly filled. A message on the screen blinked: <b>[Process Complete What else would you like to change?]</b><br />
<br />
He pondered what he wanted to change Dave into and then the idea struck him. He and Finn were both huge fans of the Rams. So why not make them into something more appealing to them?<br />
<br />
Did he want his dad to even know about it? If he was changing Finn gay…no. Definitely not. He would let him remain aware of Dave’s changes so that he’d trust Jeff with the program. Jeff filled out the appropriate information, set the timer on a delay of one minute, then hit enter. He minimized the program, setting it in his task bar, and saw the timer tick down. Grinning, he went downstairs.<br />
<br />
Dave and his father waved to him as he entered the room. Finn didn’t even bother looking up. Jeff smirked. That was probably going to change in a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
“That was quick.” Dave said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah. How was the ‘homework’, Jeff?” Mark asked slyly.<br />
<br />
“Big paper on the Rams.” Jeff winked. “I know how much Dave loves them.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Mark smiled and glanced at Dave. “Will I notice?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Jeff said and turned to Dave. “It’s a good paper. Just needed to put some final touches on it.”<br />
<br />
There was a beep from upstairs.<br />
<br />
Mark heard the tell-tale tone of the Chronivac starting and turned to Dave and started up a conversation. Jeff sat down next to Finn, ignoring how he flinched away from him, like gay was contagious. This was going to be interesting.<br />
<br />
Dave stood up and excused himself for the bathroom. Jeff’s dad frowned, following him into the hallway, stalling him. That left only Finn and Jeff sitting awkwardly in the living room, untouched chips and a plate of wings sitting undevoured on the table.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Finn twitched…and then Finn’s shoulders spread and broadened in soft crunches, muffled by Finn&#39;s hoodie. His neck expanded next, this change more visible as thick cords of muscle climbed up into his neck.  The hoodie started getting very tight as Finn’s arms and chest expanded, thick slabs of meat shoving forward and out, giving him a pair of meaty pecs.<br />
<br />
With each breath, Finn’s torso barreled out with meat. His spine popped and stretched and Finn grew another 6 inches in height. Most of the heavy meat, muscle and bone was dedicated to making Finn thicker and broader.<br />
<br />
Wave after wave of muscle was piling into Finn’s upper body, making him look hunched. The change spread down to his hips, his pelvis expanding and his ass inflating with pure muscle. Finn grunted and shifted in place as his jeans bulged, his package growing heavy. His belt strained, the buckle creaking and shuddering. It was re-sizing, but barely fast enough to not snap off form the incredible strain.<br />
<br />
Finn’s legs started to expand with more muscles. His jeans were stretched taut like they were painted on over his bulging legs. The changes continued downward and Finn’s heels lifted out of his shoes, which began to unravel, rubber and cloth disappearing into the aether.<br />
<br />
Finn’s toes fused, the toenails growing dark and thick, forming bony cloven hooves. Then the changes seemed to travel back upwards. Thick, soft fur began to grow up from the base of his hooves and up into his legs. The hair reached Finn’s hips and he grunted, leaning forward and revealing his ass crack. His tailbone moved, swelling into a nub, then extended forward a few inches, fur poofing around it. It waggled tantalizingly in the air behind Finn.<br />
<br />
Finns shifted and scratched at himself as the fur traveled up his chest and down to his large hands, the tan fur darkening to a brown. His fingernails hardened and darkened to black, matching his hooves. The fur that traveled up his neck was more of a creamy color.<br />
<br />
There was a crunch as the wave of fur hit Finn’s unchanged face and his mouth pushed forward, giving him a blunt muzzle. Tannish-brown hair grew from his chin as his ears stretched into points. Two dark brown bony horns pushed themselves out of his skull, angled backwards. They widened and curved as they grew in a spiral around his ears.<br />
<br />
Finn panted gently through his thin lips as his nose flattened and took on a goat-like texture. The tan fur spread over his cheeks and wide muzzle, advancing forward. The color drained away as it neared his mouth. His hair changed to the same tannish blonde color of his goatee and the pupils of his blue eyes twisted into an hourglass shape.<br />
<br />
There was another beep from Jeff’s room. The process was complete. Jeff stared at the thickly muscled ram sitting next to him. Finn had gone from good-looking to studly in a matter of moments. Jeff wanted nothing more than to run his hands over the ram’s body and feel his thick musculature. As he leaned forward to inspect the ram closer, he became aware of a heady barnyard scent emanating from Finn’s exposed crack. Jeff leaned over and huffed the musk, his pants tenting. <br />
<br />
Finn turned and stared at the tiger as he huffed his ass. Jeff smiled when he saw the ram’s tight jeans bulge even further. The ram leaned back, jeans covering his exposed crack, and adjusted himself, spreading his legs wider. Finn gave Jeff a shy smile and went back to munching on some celery.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed happily. Finn had turned out perfectly.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad prowled into the living room and gave Jeff a wink and a thumbs up. Jeff winked back and leaned back into the couch. He realized the couch had grown larger and sturdier. The reality shifts must have  done something, because all of their furniture was sturdier. The food on the table had shifted. Half of it was vegetarian.<br />
<br />
The toilet flushed and a larger, older ram walked out of the hall. Dave’s muzzle was flecked with white and he had a prodigious beergut. Jeff saw that he had an entire 24 pack next to his feet when the ram sat down. He guessed rams were real big fans of beer.<br />
<br />
Dave sat down with a grunt and they watched the pre-game show. Finn kept shooting glances at Jeff when he thought the tiger wasn’t looking. Jeff smirked and drank a beer. This was much, much better than having him be cold and hostile all night.<br />
<br />
He reached over to eat a chip and saw his Dad and Dave talking. He did a double-take. Was his dad rubbing Dave’s thigh? Mark turned away from Dave to get a beer and caught Jeff’s eyes. His dad looked suddenly embarrassed, hand pulling away from Dave’s leg. His dad took a quick gulp of beer and composed himself.<br />
<br />
“Hey, uh, Jeff?” Mark managed a smile. “Can you take Finn upstairs and show him that paper of yours for, say, an hour? We’ll call you when the game starts.”<br />
<br />
“And be careful with him.” The older ram leaned over, whispering in Jeff’s ear. “He’s a little slow. Got into college on a football scholarship.”<br />
<br />
So Finn&#39;s intelligence had been reduced too, huh? He caught Finn glancing at him again. The young ram looked away. Jeff smirked and nodded at Dave and his dad.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, pops. Come on, Finn.” Jeff lifted himself off the couch and stretched, flexing his muscles and giving Finn a show.<br />
<br />
He didn’t bother looking to see if Finn was watching, because he  knew he was. Jeff sauntered upstairs. He heard the creak of the stairs as Finn followed along behind him. They entered his room and Finn stood at the threshold, taking in the decor. Jeff saw the Chronivac window had popped back open.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly crossed the room and closed the Chronivac browser while Finn was still busy looking around his room. The tiger was in such a hurry that he never noticed the message that was blinking had said: <b>[Finalizing changes]</B>. Instead, he pulled up a streaming service and started playing something. Some movie about pirates. The ram stood in a corner silently.<br />
<br />
“So Finn, I guess I’ve never asked. What do you like doing?”<br />
<br />
“I like playing football.” The ram said nervously.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down on his bed and patted the space next to him. “Come on, sit down big guy.”<br />
<br />
The ram hesitated but sat down. Jeff got up and closed the door, making sure he locked it. He came back and sat down next to the shy ram.<br />
<br />
“Your dad said you need help with your classes?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m…kinda dumb.” Finn looked away.<br />
<br />
“I’m a little slow too.” Jeff said gently.<br />
<br />
It was true, the kind of complex thought he used to enjoy was gone now. He had very little room in his head for real big thoughts. Maybe it was the skull shape that reduced his intelligence. Even Jeff’s memories of his old life were fading away.<br />
<br />
 He rubbed the ram’s back to comfort him, feeling the thick muscles under his hide. <br />
<br />
“I think you’re really smart.” Finn said.<br />
<br />
“That’s nice of you to say, but…”<br />
<br />
“And, uh, I think you’re pretty hot.”<br />
<br />
“Hot?” Jeff smirked.<br />
<br />
“Err, cool! I meant cool.” Finn somehow managed a blush through his fur.<br />
<br />
“Right.” Jeff smiled and stripped, starting with his shirt, revealing his equally muscular body.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Getting ready to fuck you, Finn.” Jeff pulled down his pants and jockstrap. “Well?”<br />
<br />
The ram fiddled nervously with his hoodie.<br />
<br />
“I, uh, I put on weight in college.” Finn stammered, rubbing his horns with his head hooflets. “Freshman fifty. Can we leave the hood on?”<br />
<br />
“Come on wool head.” Jeff growled and pulled the hoodie off the ram. “Get serious.”<br />
<br />
Finn’s furry beergut flopped free as his hoodie was pulled off. It wobbled, a soft contrast to the firm, hardened muscles around it. Jeff reached out and rubbed it. Finn moaned and lean back. <br />
<br />
“Y-you don’t mind it?” Finn asked, looking away, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s cute.”  Jeff said, petting the soft fur on it, feeling the softness. “How’d a guy like you get a gut like that?”<br />
<br />
“I like beer.” Finn shrugged.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned in and they locked muzzles. They slowly lowered themselves onto the bed. Jeff could feel Finn’s bovine length throb against his thigh. He reached out a paw and squeezed it through Finn’s jeans.<br />
<br />
Finn gave a bleat of surprise and covered his mouth his hooflet.<br />
<br />
“Take off your jeans.” Jeff growled.<br />
<br />
Finn struggled to peel them off. He shucked them after a minute and stood naked in front of Jeff. The big broad ram was hefty in every sense of the word-his muscles, belly, balls. A heavy barnyard musk filled Jeff’s room. Jeff panted and chuffed happily.<br />
<br />
“Turn around. I want that ass.” Jeff growled.<br />
<br />
Finn gingerly turned over. Jeff took a long, slow slick across his tailhole and savored the meaty taste. Finn bleated and shoved his head into the sheets and raised his ass. Jeff grinned and buried himself under the ram’s waggly tail.<br />
<br />
Jeff lapped at the ram’s throbbing hole, lovingly tracing the outside of the ring before driving his tongue straight into it, forcing a bleat from the ram. He placed his paws on the ram’s thick cheeks and spread Finn’s ass further, Finn moaned and bleated as Jeff whirled his tongue deeper and deeper inside the Ram. <br />
<br />
Finn’s breath came quick and short, face buried in Jeff’s sheets. Muffled bleats came from him, Jeff’s tongue drawing forth pleasures the ram had never known before. Jeff made sure the ram’s ass was well-coated in saliva, tongue exploring Finn’s musky passage.<br />
<br />
After giving the ram a proper rimming, and ensuring Finn was loosened, Jeff pulled his muzzle away and got some lube out of his desk draw. He spread it over the ram’s ass. Fin’s huge cheeks quivered and twitched as Jeff applied the lube liberally.<br />
<br />
“You wanna ride this tiger, Finn?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
The ram nodded slowly and clambered onto Jeff’s chest, reaching his hooflets back and positioned Jeff’s lubed cock between his cheek. He pushed softly against it, rubbing it between his muscular butt cheeks sensually as it teased his tailhole. Finn reached back and positioned the top of Jeff’s throbbing member at his tailhole. He pushed his hips back slowly, letting the head slip past his tight ring, before placing both hooflets on Jeff’s meaty pecs. He drove his hips down the rest of the shaft, butt bumping firmly against Jeff’s waist.<br />
<br />
Both young lovers cried out with shock at the incredible pleasure. The ram clenched his ass tightly around Jeff&#39;s thick cock as it filled him completely, a look of bliss spreading across Finn’s face. Finn rocked his hips back and forth, keeping the cock locked deep within him as it tickled his insides with each grind of his hips. His hooflets clenched Jeff’s thick chest fur.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled as he watched Finn rock his hips against his cock, bleating wildly as he rode him. Jeff gripped the ram’s thighs, pulled his cock from Finn’s sensitive tailhole and slammed it back him, holding him down on his thick rod.<br />
<br />
Finn bleated as he was pounded and his cock shot a wad of precum across Jeff’s chest. The intense jolt of pleasure made him collapse against the tiger. Jeff’s cock throbbed deep inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Oooh…oh god…fuck me Jeff…” Finn breathed, head resting in the crook of the muscular tiger’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Ok, Finn.” Jeff scratched gently around the ram’s large horns. Finn’s cock drooled between them. Hearing Finn plead like that had him rock hard. “I’ll fuck you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shifted in bed and stabilized himself properly. Then he lifted his ass and thrust deep into Finn’s tailhole, his paws keeping the ram’s legs down on it. Finn moaned and groaned louder and longer with each thrust, interrupted each time he was hilted balls-deep by Jeff’s thrusting cock. Finn wrapped his heavily muscled arms tightly around the tiger, whimpering and bleating as the pounding increased in frequency. Jeff’s balls slapped loudly against the ram’s rump with growing force. He gripped the ram’s shoulder and held him tightly, thrusts becoming hard, fast and frantic.<br />
<br />
The bed lurched beneath them, but more was changing than Finn’s sexuality.  Around the room pictures were changing. A photo on Jeff’s desk of him and a girl at the prom shifted to Jeff and Finn. The barnyard stink sort of settled in more permanently as Finn’s belongings suddenly appeared, Finn’s guitar propped in the corner. The bed stopped creaking as it became reinforced. Memories of his old life completely faded away as Jeff filled  his boyfriend’s luscious donut.<br />
<br />
“Oh go, oh fuck, Jeff! I’m gonna…! I’m…!” Finn moaned and cried, head buried in Jeff’s thick chest and gripping his back as his body started to tense up. His ass was pounded harder and harder. He let out a loud bleat of pleasure, pushing himself back onto the tiger’s cock as his tailhole squeezed tightly around it. It sent him over the edge.<br />
<br />
Finn’s hugely muscled body shook and he gripped Jeff’s fur desperately as his thick cock began shooting streams of jism, throbbing violently as he came without being touched.  Finn’s tailhole clenching around his cock along with his wild and desperate moans were too much for Jeff, his last thrusts becoming sharp and erratic as he drove his tiger-hood deep. His cum coated the inner walls of the ram’s tight hole. He continued thrusting, grinding his hips under the ram’s tail, cum filling and overfilling as it leaked out around the pulsing cock.<br />
<br />
They gripped each other tightly as the moaned together, each deep thrust milking both of their orgasms for all that they were worth. Finn panted desperately and collapsed on top of Jeff, bleating softly as the tiger continued to slowly drive his cock into the ram’s messy used hole.  They lay there panting, awash in the sensations. Jeff’s thrusts slowed to a stop, cock deep in the ram, warm seed leaking from Finn’s hole and pooling around his balls and the sheets below.<br />
<br />
The computer beeped. Jeff looked over at it and frowned. The <b>[Process Complete. What else would you like to change?]</b> message was flashing on the screen. Something had changed? He looked over at his boyfriend and back at the computer. He couldn’t imagine what.<br />
<br />
“Game’s starting!” Mark called up to them.<br />
<br />
Jeff minimized the screen again.<br />
<br />
He and Finn shared a kiss and walked downstairs. The living room smelled of musk as well. Dave and Mark were clearly pretending nothing had happened, though the scent of their lovemaking and the fact that they were both out of breath suggested something else.<br />
<br />
Finn lay his horned head on Jeff’s soldiers and the tiger put his arm around the big ram. They watched the game as a couple, cuddled together on their corner of the couch. Jeff softly rubbed the His boyfriend’s back and kissed the top of Finn’s head.<br />
<br />
It was a good night.</p>
