<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Annetta, Andrea and the other girls strode through the streets of the Pleasure Island Amusement Park in search of fun. <br />
<br />
They had just stopped at one of the many food stalls and had gotten something to snack on. Andrea had gotten a whole pizza and Annetta had got both a blueberry Pie and a cone of strawberry ice cream, which had all been free.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d I tell ya, Annetta,&quot; Adelina said as she took a bite of her chocolate cake. &quot;Pleasure Island is the real paradise. No parents, no teachers, no rules, and you can do anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annetta nodded her head in agreement as she took a lick of her ice cream cone. <br />
<br />
Directly in front of them was a large tent full of mattresses, cushions, and pillows where many girls were engaging in a semi friendly scrap with each other using pillows and cushions as weapons.<br />
<br />
Noemi, Angelica, Mariella, Francesca, Irene, Carina, Adelina, Andrea and Annetta entered to participate in the pillow fight, there they took pillows and began to beat other girls with them shedding feathers throughout the tent.<br />
<br />
The one who had the most fun was Adelina, who was the one who hit the most with her pillow among all of them, even knocking out a tooth from Noemi. Although Annetta also hit quite a bit, jumping from mattress to mattress trying to avoid the pillows.<br />
<br />
Many minutes later, Andrea and Annetta got out of the tent together, separating from the group. <br />
<br />
Their next destination was a part of the island called &quot;Tobacco Row&quot;, where Annetta and Andrea both took some cigars. The two girls had never smoked before, so it took them time to get used to tobacco smoke.<br />
<br />
As they both smoked their cigars, they could see an old west style saloon towards the back section of Tobacco Row. Next to the saloon was a stable and outside the stable were a group of eight donkey foals. <br />
<br />
The little female foals had ropes around their necks that were tethered to wooden posts in the ground. Next to the little donkeys was a wooden sign that read: “PLEASE, TEASE THE DONKEYS”, which was what a group of girls were currently doing. Among that group were Angelica and Francesca who had grown tired of playing pillow fights as well.<br />
<br />
The young jennies were tortured. Girls like Francesca pulled their tails, others pulled their long ears, pinched and yelled at them, and some like Angelica threw eggs and rotten tomatoes at them. <br />
<br />
The terrified little jennies tried to resist and get away, but they were firmly tethered to the post and could not escape. They only could bray and shake their heads desperately back and forth. Even some donkeys seemed shed tears like that of a child.<br />
<br />
Before going with Andrea to another part, Annetta turned to see Angelica kicking the belly of one of the donkeys with her yellow clog while Francesca grimaced and stuck her tongue out at another foal.<br />
<br />
Next Annetta and Andrea made their way to an area of the island where a large and elegant mansion style house stood. Near the house was a sign that read: &quot;MODEL HOME OPEN FOR DESTRUCTION&quot;. <br />
<br />
The house was built specifically for the girls on the island to vandalize and destroy. The girls were wrecking everything they could both inside the house and out. They toppled over flowers in their vases. They hurled bricks into windows.<br />
<br />
And that was just on the outside.<br />
<br />
Inside the girls trashed the building as much as they wanted. They did everything and anything they could to destroy the lovely house. A girl splashed and slashed a replica of famous painting hanging on the wall and another girl chopped the limbs off the furniture with an axe. Other girls rummaged through drawers and pulled out everything they could till it littered the floor. <br />
<br />
There they saw a girl with long red hair yelling as she grabbed hold of a chandelier. That girl was Carina and she was swinging happily from the chandelier. Below her was Noemi who was busied herself with chopping the limbs off a pricey piano and Irene who was pushing at a huge grandfather clock until it fell over and smashed on the floor. Then, Irene jumped on it to destroy all of it.<br />
<br />
Annetta and Andrea wanted to participate and went wild. The two girls teared apart anything they could get their hands on. They mashed lamps, pushed ornate marble statues over so that they would shatter into pieces, hung from chandeliers until they fell and busted down doors with axes. They thoroughly enjoyed tearing apart the house with the mob of girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Andrea! Get a load of that stained-glass window.&quot; Annetta turned and pointed up at an unbroken window that was above them. She then picked up a brick from the floor and pitched it right up into the air like a baseball, smashing the window in shards of broken glass. <br />
<br />
Annetta and Andrea were laughing hysterically with the other girls in the house. They had no idea just how much fun smashing things could be! It was a joy knowing she could do it without having to worry about getting into trouble or smashing something someone owned.<br />
<br />
At the evening, Annetta and Andrea found themselves in an area on the farthest side of the island called: &quot;The Forest of Sweets&quot;, which is exactly what it was. Nestled in the back between the rocky cliffs that surrounded the entire island was an entire forest made of candy and sweets. <br />
<br />
Aside from the ground -- the grass -- and the rocky cliffs that surrounded the area, everything was completely and deliciously eatable. The grass was made of soft minty sugar, and the girls bent down and took big handfuls of that sweet grass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it wonderful!&quot; said a girl there. &quot;Hasn&#39;t it got a wonderful taste? I could eat the whole field!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; answered another girl next to her grinning with delight, &quot;I could go around on all fours like a field animal and eat every blade of grass in the field!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trees had branches of gum drops, candy apples and chocolate. The stones that pebbled the paths across the grass were jaw breakers. <br />
<br />
There was a river of chocolate that was drinkable. Annetta saw on the riverbanks that there were many girls drinking from it. Among them was a pale skin girl, light blue eyes, and platinum blonde hair with a green dress that looked familiar. That girl was Adelina who was kneeling and using both hands to hold the delicious liquid chocolate and drink it. Mariella, who was next to her,  imitated her but she had her face and dress full of chocolate unlike Adelina.<br />
<br />
Annetta and Andrea took refuge in a row of life sized gingerbread houses that were fully furnished and took a brief break from all the fun they were having. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the life, ain&#39;t it Annetta?&quot; Andrea remarked as she took a bite out of a caramel covered candy apple she pulled off one of the trees. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, Andrea!&quot; Annetta replied as she stuffed her face with various chocolately treats. &quot;I don&#39;t never wanna leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Coachwoman, Fillipo and Mattia looked at everything with joy. The woman showed a malicious smile and laughed wickedly at the girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on! Enjoy yourselves, you stupids! Play games. Don’t think about anything but fun. And soon very soon, you&#39;ll be ready. Its only a matter of time. Give a bad girl enough rope and she&#39;ll soon make an ass of herself.&quot;</p>
