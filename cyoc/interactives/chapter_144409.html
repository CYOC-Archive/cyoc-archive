<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So what did you two hear from Lynne,” Lisa asked, her face contorting after her latest contraction. “Well I think she’s scared,” Katie said. “I mean she is a baby. Every time there’s a contraction it frightens her, she’s wondering why her home is trying to push her out. We had to try and explain that that is what’s supposed to happen.”<br />
<br />
“Do ya u think it worked,” Jason asked. “I think so dad,” Gloria stated. “She’s willing to trust us. Probably why Dr. Harris is her original size again.”<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll take what I can get,” Julia mumbled. “If I got any shorter I would need a step stool to help with the delivery.” As the group now talked they were surprised as the door to Lisa’s room was flung open. Turning in surprise they saw Lisa’s parents, sisters, and Katie’s fiancé Kellie enter the room, baby Morgan cradled in Kellies arms. “We’re not too late are we,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“No not yet,” Katie said. “But she should be here soon.” The others nodded as Marilyn, Ann, and Katie’s mom Kellie approached. “How you doing Lisa,” Marilyn asked.<br />
<br />
“Feels like I’m trying to push a watermelon through a pin sized hole,” Lisa grumbled. “So I’ve been better.”<br />
<br />
“Welcome to my world,” Marilyn smirked. “Did this three times so know the feeling.” <br />
<br />
Ann and Kellie now approached their sister a look of concern on their faces. “Can we do anything for you,” Kellie asked. “Yeah buy me a lot of booze when this is over,” Lisa grinned. “I’m gonna need a drink.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Kellie chuckled as they now wiped the sweat off their sisters brow. “I don’t know if that’s the best idea sis,” Ann stated. “I mean you u sure you want to get drunk on your first night as a mom.”<br />
<br />
“This coming from the girl that’s been causing a bunch of mischief the last couple of weekends,” Lisa whispered, causing Ann to blush. “What’s she talking about Ann,” Marilyn asked, curiously gazing at her middle daughter. “Nothing, Nothing,” Ann said quickly. “Lisa is just high in the drugs they gave her. She must be imagining things.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Gloria watched with interest as their grandmother now began to study Ann carefully. Both girls were well aware of Ann’s recent date night activities (Gloria having personally witnessed them). Marilyn though wasn’t aware of these activities and now tried to discover Ann’s secrets. “Your hiding something Ann,” Marilyn grumbled. “What have you been up too?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing mom geez,” Ann whined. “Lisa is just busting my chops. Besides I’m a grown woman, I don’t need to explain my romantic life to anyone.”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Ann, Lisa (and in turn Lynne) could hear Ann’s statements. Both mother and daughter had a fiendish sense of humor and loved playing pranks on their sisters. Since Lisa had no magic in which to pull pranks on her sister, Lynne decided to do it for her.<br />
<br />
Katie and Gloria watched as Ann’s features began to soften as she retreated from 40 and sped through her 30s. Ann’s family began to notice the changes to Ann, their mouths beginning to hang open as they watched the blond woman youthen. “Um Ann,” Martin stammered. “You feeling okay?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m fine,” a 29 year old Ann said, blushing slightly. “Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
“No reason,” Katie said quickly, giving a look at her family seeming to indicate that now would not be the best time to tell Ann about her regression. Ann paused as she looked down at her sister, noticing a smirk spreading on her sisters face. “What are you grinning about,” a 26 year old Ann asked, a small frown spreading on her youthful face. “Oh it’s nothing Ann,” Lisa grinned. “But what was that you were saying about being a grown woman?”<br />
<br />
Ann remained oblivious to the changes as she placed her hands on her narrowing hips. “I said what I do in my relationship is no ones business,” the now college senior stated. “I’m a grown woman. My relationship is no ones business but my own.”<br />
<br />
“”Of course,” Lisa smirked. “Would never question your relationship. But I am curious what was that you were saying about being a grown woman?”<br />
<br />
Ann furrowed her brow as she became a skinny blond teen of 18 again. The girl looked flummoxed as she gazed at her pregnant sister, still unaware of the changes. The others watched as the girl began absentmindedly adjusting her loosening business suit, the pants slipping on her narrowing waist while she adjusted her bra straps. “What’s with the weird questions,” Ann asked as she shrank down to 16. “I mean I’m your older sister their Lisa. Your acting really weird, you sure they didn’t give you too many drugs?”<br />
<br />
“oh I’m positive,” Lisa giggled. “But you might want to take a look in the mirror.”<br />
<br />
Ann paused as she walked towards the bathroom mirror. For some reason her clothing felt odd on her body,yet she couldn’t explain why. After stumbling in her heels, which seemed too large on her, she gazed into the mirror; letting out a girlish squeal.<br />
<br />
“What! Why!” Ann screamed, shrinking down to 13. “How come I’m getting younger?”<br />
<br />
“Think it’s your nieces final prank before she’s born,” Lisa laughed. “And looks like a good one too.”<br />
<br />
“So not cool,” Ann grumbled as she shrank down to 12. Looking in the mirror she gasped, noticing she was rapidly approaching childhood. “Hey how young am I gonna get,” she asked, noticing she was now only 11. Ann looked up at her family, noticing she was now considerably shorter than everyone in the room. “I don’t want to be a little girl again.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t think Lynne is giving you much of a choice in the matter,” Kellie said, ruffling her sisters hair. Ann huffed in annoyance, folding her arms across her now flat chest. The now 10 year old blond gave a girlish squeal as her dress pants fell from her waist, pooling around her feet. “Oh cmon really,” she groaned as she went from 10 to 9.<br />
<br />
“I have a feeling Morgan and Lynne aren’t going to be the only babies in here in a moment,” Gloria whispered to her sister. Katie nodded in agreement as they watched Ann continue to grow younger. The young blond child was quickly getting younger, her clothing slowly but surely engulfing the child. Ann groaned in annoyance and frustration as she found herself continueing to grow younger. As the girl went from 5 to 4 she looked up at her family in shock. “I So whittle,” she lisped.<br />
<br />
“Lisa,” Marilyn whispered. “How young is your sister going to get?”<br />
<br />
“Think your granddaughter wants to bring Ann down to her level,” Lisa shrugged.<br />
<br />
Ann’s eyes went wide as she continued to youthen. “No baby,” Ann poured as she became 3, stomping her small foot on the ground. “Don’t think you have much of a choice in it kiddo,” Lisa laughed as she watched her sister become 2.<br />
<br />
Ann gazed at her family in wonder as she dropped below 2. The woman’s once Well fitting business suit had fallen away from her body leaving the toddler nude in a pile of her own clothes. The tiny blond stuck her thumb in her mouth as she became 1, wobbling on unsteady legs before falling onto her butt. As her regression completed, leaving her a tiny infant of only a few months, she gazed up at her family in wonder.<br />
<br />
“Well wasn’t expecting that,” Marilyn stated as she scooped up the tiny girl. Ann now tried to speak, finding she could only babble in an infantile manner. Seeing she was now stuck as an infant of only a few months she seemed to huff in annoyance, the look of annoyance on her face making her look as if she was a gassy infant. <br />
<br />
“Lisa,” Martin stated. “Care to explain why your daughter just turned her aunt into an infant.”<br />
<br />
“Kind of what Lynne does,” Lisa shrugged. “Don’t worry dad I’ll have a talk with her after she’s born. Still got to admire her sense of humor.”<br />
<br />
Martin frowned as he now looked between his now infant daughter and Lisa. “Well she’s definitely her mother’s daughter,” he sighed. “Only you would think knocking your sister down a peg would be funny. Now where’s the diapers, don’t want Ann ruining your mother’s shirt.”<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn now searched for a diaper for Ann as Lisa stifled a giggle. She knew Ann would be olky once Lynne was born, she just found it funny that Lynne would play one more prank on her sister. Hopefully this would be the last bit of magic Lynne would perform until after she was born.</p>
