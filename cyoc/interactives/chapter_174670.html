<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary wasn&#39;t really sure what she was doing next, but she sure felt excited by it. She turned off the main road, ducking into a small alley where she was unlikely to be seen, then relaxed a little knowing she had some privacy.<br />
<br />
Mary then turned her attention to the cigarette, still slowly burning away. Without hesitation, she acted like she had in her dream, holding it near the filter between her index and middle fingers, then brought it up to her lips. Acting on instinct, directed mainly by how she did it in her dream, she sucked on it,  feeling her mouth fill with the taste of the smoke, which was better than she was imagining. After pulling on it for a few seconds, she then took it from her lips and slowly breathed in, smoothly drawing it into her lungs without a single cough, then a moment later exhaled a weak cloud of smoke. She quickly inhaled again, eager to keep going, then spent the next 90 seconds hungrily finishing it.<br />
<br />
Mary dipped back out of her hiding place and went back to the main road, resuming her walk home. She felt excited and alive, and also a little light headed. For once she was relieved she had the house to herself, so nobody would notice the lingering smell around her. She beelined straight for the shower, still basking in the feeling of doing something out of character. Mary had felt slightly aroused before, but this was something else. Once she was done washing, she removed the shower head and directed it between her legs. It only took a couple of minutes before she was leaning against the wall, panting and moaning as her hips gyrated against the flow of the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, oh god, fuck! Fuck fuck fuck! Ohhh FUCK&quot; she screamed, again thankful that nobody was home to hear her experience her first orgasm. <br />
<br />
She put the shower head back in its holder, then stood under the water for another few minutes as she pulled herself back together. <br />
<br />
An hour later and her Mother got home from work, followed by her Father an hour after that. Mary was a little nervous they would notice the smell, but by dinner time she was confident they hadn&#39;t picked up on anything. <br />
<br />
Mary was chattier again over dinner, much to the relief of her parents. She talked about how well school was going, and what she&#39;d been studying the last couple of nights and what she&#39;s working on at the moment. They didn&#39;t have to know she was lying about it, she honestly had no idea what was happening in school the last couple of days, but she just wanted to convince them she was fine.<br />
<br />
The rest of Mary&#39;s evening was spent watching trash on TV and browsing social media on her phone, while her parents thought she was studying some more. Then around 10pm she fell asleep, comfortably.<br />
<br />
She found herself at the bus stop again in her dreams. Surrounded by the same few people as before. They were passing a can of beer between each other, and singing along to some rap song playing from the guy&#39;s phone.<br />
The beer reached Mary and she had a couple mouthfuls, then passed it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mare, you got a spare fag I could &#39;ave?&quot; The blonde asked, looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, course babes&quot; she replied, then reached into her bag. She pulled out her pack of cigarettes and a lighter, then took two from the pack, handing one to her friend and put the other between her own lips. She dangled it as she put the pack back in her back, then lit up, dragging on it a few times as she put the lighter away, then removed it from her mouth, exhaling a thick stream of smoke.<br />
<br />
The blonde and the other girl started talking between themselves, so Mary found herself walking over to the guy, turning around, and sitting on his lap. He wrapped his arms round her waste and spoke into her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright babe?&quot; He asked, as she dragged on her cigarette again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea fine&quot; she said, then turned to look at him and kissed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still comin&#39; back to mine later yea?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Course I am&quot; Mary replied. She slid her spare hand under her butt, and onto his crotch, rubbing at it gently. She felt him move slightly under her hand, and a tingly sensation wash across her own body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oi, get a fuckin&#39; room will ya?&quot; The blonde directed at them, nodding her head at Mary&#39;s hand placement. She quickly stood back up and returned to standing by the blonde&#39;s side, leaning against the wall, shooting a wink and a smile back at the guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi oi, look at this little rich bitch&quot; the blonde said, causing Mary to look and see the familiar sight of herself trying to walk through the middle of them. Mary was unable to help herself again, reaching out to other-her to yank her backwards, grabbing her hair instead of her backpack this time.<br />
<br />
Without letting go of her hair, she turned other-her to face her. She looked terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi, she was fuckin&#39; talkin&#39; to ya, you not gonna say anythin&#39; back?&quot; She shouted in her face. Other-her said nothing, and just started crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, the big rich girls just a little scaredy-cunt ain&#39;t she?&quot; She taunted, enjoying the power she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ay girls, bus is &#39;ere, back off and let&#39;s go&quot; her  boyfriend said from  behind her. Mary let go of other-her&#39;s hair and shoved her back into the wall, then took a long drag on her cigarette and blew it in her face before turning around and following the others onto the bus. The other two girls sat next to each other halfway down the bus, so Mary grabbed the guys hand and led him to the empty seats at the back. Once they sat, she put her hand back in his crotch, and gently rubbed as she laughed at other-her sobbing against the wall.<br />
<br />
Then Mary woke up, and all she could think about was another session in the shower.</p>
