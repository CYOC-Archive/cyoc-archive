<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha quickly changed Tom&#39;s species field to dog. Then she changed his breed back to greyhound and his gender to female. <br />
<br />
She left intelligence at a 1, so Tom would be fully human in mind. <br />
<br />
She clicked Confirm change, and quickly clicked the warning message that came up, not paying attention to what it said. <br />
<br />
Tom, just now starting to stand up off the floor looked at the screen &quot;Wait! No!!&quot; Was all Tom could say as he felt the familiar feeling of change hit his body. He froze again and fell to the ground. <br />
<br />
Samantha stood over her withering husband. Watching his slightly muscular white boy body starting to sprout short grey hairs. His arms growing skinnier and reshaping. &quot;So much for all that working out Tom! Greyhounds are quite skinny! Also, I saw how you presented yourself to Max! So I figured you&#39;d enjoy having his dick inside of you!&quot; Samantha said with a slight grin.<br />
<br />
She watched as Tom&#39;s penis started to get pulled into his body, followed by his balls. Soon all that was left was a dark, small, canine pussy. She nelt down closer to Tom, who was almost completely changed by now. &quot;Tom look at your cute little pussy. Max is going to be HUGE to you.... believe me! I know!&quot; She snickered. <br />
<br />
Tom was again, filled with fear. His body had finished changing by now and he remained on the floor. Whining, like the bitch he had become again. <br />
<br />
Samantha glared at her husband, the whining bitch greyhound below her. &quot;You look pathetic Tom. At least try to act like a man.&quot; Samantha laughed slightly &quot;Well as much of a man who&#39;s about to get his bitch pussy fucked by his own dog!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom darted his head towards his wife. She couldn&#39;t be serious! She wasn&#39;t going to let Max fuck him, was she? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well no reason to wait. Let me go get your dog....well soon to be lover&quot; Samantha chuckled as she stood up straight and made her way to the back door. <br />
<br />
Tom laid there for a minute thinking of his options. Unlike last time, Tom had his full human intelligence and had no desire to have sex with Max. <br />
<br />
Tom sprang to his paws. He may not be able to fight off Max, who was a much larger dog than he was, but he knew that as a greyhound he&#39;d be able to outrun him! But where would he go? He was trapped in his house. But he had to try. Tom darted out of his office and ran down the hallway, in the opposite direction of the backyard door. <br />
<br />
He ran so fast that he slipped on his hardwood floors and slid into the wall. He Yelp in pain! But quickly started running again. It wasn&#39;t long until he heard, with his newfound excellent ears, the familiar sound of Max&#39;s long nails clicking on the floor. Max must have picked up the his scent, because Max was running through the house now. <br />
<br />
&quot;No use in running sweetie! Max is a determined lover! Believe me, he ripped my favorite pants in the backyard to claim me!&quot; Tom could hear his wife yelling from the backdoor. &quot;It probably won&#39;t hurt....too much!&quot; She laughed. <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s heart was pounding. He didn&#39;t want to be mater with! He also knew that if Max impregnated him, that he&#39;d be a dog forever! A bitch dog! <br />
<br />
Tom turned into his family room, this time he didn&#39;t fall. He had no choice but to keep running, even if he was led back to the kitchen. He had to keep running from Max. <br />
<br />
He could hear Max&#39;s panting behind him. He could also smell him. Smell his package, that was probably already hard, ready to impale his newly form pussy. <br />
<br />
Tom turned into the kitchen where Samantha still stood by the backdoor. As he started to pass her, Samantha sprung at Tom. Tackling him to the floor. <br />
<br />
Tom yelped in pain! Samantha was much stronger then he was now. Tom struggled against his wife. But Samantha wasn&#39;t letting go. She quickly positioned herself over her greyhound husband and grabbed his two rear legs. She forced his rear to stand upwards! She grabbed his tail, which was tucked between his legs in fear, and moved it to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go Max! Come make your &#39;master&#39; a happy little bitch!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom could sense the presence of Max behind him now. He struggled, but his wife was too strong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down tom! You&#39;ll only hurt yourself if you struggle!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom could now smell Max very well now. His musk was everywhere. Tom whined and then unwillingly started to urinate!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gross! Tom! Did you just piss yourself?! You don&#39;t need to be so scared. I just want you to know what it felt like to be fucked! I will turn you back afterwards....just let this happen&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom soon realized that his wife had no idea the danger he was in. If Max knocked him up, his life would be forever changed. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Tom felt something hard poking at his rear. Max was mounting him. Tom felt several more pokes and realized Max was having trouble finding his opening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Max! Let me help you!&quot; Samantha then used her hands to guide Tom&#39;s rear so align with Max&#39;s penis. As soon as the pointed tip of Max&#39;s moist red rocket entered Tom&#39;s folds, his eyes shot open! He felt Max move closer, shoving his penis even deeper into Tom. Tom had never felt anything like this before. A long hard rod of a penis, stretching open folds of his pussy, sending pleasure shooting through his body! Tom slowly stopped struggling as he felt Max starting to hump. His penis slowly going deeper and harder into his vagina. Tom could feel his vagina growing wetter, which made the pleasure increase. <br />
<br />
Tom could feel Max&#39;s knot at the entrance of his vagina, Tom&#39;s pussy must have been too tight for such a large knot to enter. But Samantha wouldn&#39;t have it. &quot;Let me help you &#39;tie the knot&#39; Tom!&quot; She then, timed up with Max&#39;s hump, and pushed Tom&#39;s body into Max, forcing the knot of Max&#39;s cock into Tom&#39;s tight pussy!<br />
<br />
Tom whined in pain! He was locked. He was stretched beyond anything he could ever imagine. But even though he felt stretched, he also couldn&#39;t deny the wave after wave of pleasure Max was sending through his bitch body with every hump. <br />
<br />
Tom slowly started to push back into Max with his humps. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Tom! Are you enjoying this?&quot; Samantha questioned. &quot;At least I tried to fight Max off. You... you&#39;re enjoying yourself.&quot; Tom looked up at his wife, she was disgusted at him. &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say you were born a bitch. A bitch that loved being fucked!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max started humping faster and faster. Tom&#39;s eyes widened. He was still look into his wife&#39;s eyes when he felt Max&#39;s penis pulse and shoot his warm load into his pussy and pushed Tom over the edge and he climaxed with a howl of pleasure! <br />
<br />
&quot;Gross Tom! Did you just have a bitch orgasm?&quot; Samantha said disgusted with her husband. <br />
<br />
Tom and Max stood there. Max still mounted on her master, balls deep in his pussy. Both Tom and Max had their long tongues hanging from their mouths, panting from their love making. <br />
<br />
Samantha sighed &quot;Well Tom, you have fun while you wait for that thing to soften enough to let you free. I&#39;ll be back in a few.&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha left the mating dogs in the kitchen and made her way back to Tom&#39;s office. She considered her options as she looked at the computer and decided to....</p>
