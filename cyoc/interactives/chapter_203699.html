<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked over the survey, startled at how long it was. Usually these sorts of surveys were only about five or ten questions long, but this one was incredibly detailed…..almost like it was one of those “create a new character” sheets from the online RPGs you played occasionally or something. You glance back up at the front of the class, where the teacher droned on, seemingly oblivious to the fact his class wasn’t paying the slightest bit of attention. You check the clock. Still thirty more minutes period this class ended, you noted with a internal groan. Hopefully this would kill some time. <br />
<br />
Looking down at the sheet, you noticed that it was all about how you’d would be if you were a girl. Strange topic, but you’d filled out weirder ones online out of boredom, you thought. You read:<br />
—————————————————————<br />
If You Were a Girl...<br />
<br />
1) If you were a girl... would your handwriting be neat?<br />
<br />
You fill out A] Yes. Seemed simple enough. You didn’t notice, but your handwriting got noticeably neater and more precise compared to the notes you’d taken earlier in the day. <br />
<br />
2) If you were a girl... how often would you wear heels?<br />
<br />
You shrugged. You didn’t really care super much about shoes, only really wearing one pair, but you figured girl you would probably be at least a little into them. You circle C] Sometimes, figuring that you’d probably have at least a pair or two for formal occasions, like dress shoes. Your sneakers morph into a pair of heels—short ones, nothing too crazy, the type of shoes that you could walk in for a while without feeling too uncomfortable. A new pair of sky blue gm shoes meanwhile, materializes in your locker.  <br />
<br />
3) If you were a girl... would you use makeup?<br />
<br />
You read the question and with another shrug you circle A] Yes, always. Your mom and sisters always seemed to be in the bathroom all day checking or doing their makeup, your sister had once launched into a fifteen minute full on rant about how important it was when you’d complained about her taking so long in there. You figure most girls probably saw it as being essential to looking good like they did, even if it was a pain to deal with sometimes. Subtle makeup appears on your face and you shift in your seat. You feel a little strange, but shake it off. After all, you have to look good, right? <br />
<br />
4) If you were a girl... would you paint your nails?<br />
You circle B] Yes, sometimes, not really having a opinion on the question. You idly glance down at your hot pink nails as you set the pencil down for a second. Were they always that color? Did you need to get them done again? <br />
<br />
5) If you were a girl... How big would your breasts be? <br />
You figure you’d probably have medium-large-ish breasts, and circle B] C-Cup. You shift in your chair uncomfortably……your body felt tingly all over, especially your chest, which suddenly feels heavier than before.  Two large orbs materialize on your chest, soon cradled by a bra. Unconsciously, you fidget with one of the bra straps. When did your clothes get so uncomfortable? <br />
<br />
6) If you were a girl... would you have an hourglass figure?<br />
<br />
You grin and circle A] Yes, Show it off! After all, if you’ve got it, why not flaunt it? You pause for a second. Where did THAT thought come from? You shake your head for a second, trying to clear the fuzzy feeling that is starting to fill your mind. There’s a soft series of pops as your hips widen while your waist narrows, your t-shirt and pants becoming slightly skimpier and lower cut. <br />
<br />
7) If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
You read the question and circle A] Yes without even really thinking about it. After all, you were straight as a guy, so girl you would probably be straight as well. The fuzzy feeling in your head gets really bad for a second, and suddenly you hear a pop. Wincing and blinking, you glance around to see if anyone else noticed it. No one seems to have, and you smile as you spot your friend Gavin, one of the hunky guys on the football team, toss you a wink. You smile back at him, feeling a bit of a flutter in your stomach. God, he was so good looking!<br />
<br />
8) If you were a girl... what color hair would you have?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Blond; after all, blondes have more fun, right? Unbeknownst to you, your hair rapidly begins lightening, dropping down to your mid back as you answer  B] Down to the mid-back and A] Straight for the next two questions. <br />
<br />
11) If you were a girl... would you wear dresses and skirts?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Yes, always; you just find dresses and skirts sooooo cute! Your pants melt upwards, warping into a white skirt which wraps itself tightly around your feminine body. Sure, it was a little annoying not having pockets, but that is what your purse is for after all! <br />
<br />
12) If you were a girl... how tall would you be?<br />
<br />
You sigh a bit as you read the question. Girls in your family were super short, and you didn’t think you would be any different. You circle C] Short (5&#39; 0&quot; to 5&#39; 3&quot;). The weird tingling sensation occurs again, this time across your entire body. You begin to shrink down until you are only 5’2, your clothing adjusting to your new, much more petite frame.  <br />
<br />
13) If you were a girl... how old would you be?<br />
<br />
You roll your eyes and circle A] 18 (end of puberty). Of course you were 18. This was a class for high school seniors after all. Although judging by how the teacher was just droning on….and on….and on, nobody was learning a thing. <br />
<br />
14) If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
Just as before, something inside you makes you circle A] Yes, you adore pink. Your top changed color, becoming a bright pink, and you idly think about it matches your room’s own bright pink color scheme. Pink had been for your favorite color ever since you were a little girl—err, guy—after all. <br />
<br />
15) If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
You shrug and circle A] No need. It was waxed off. What was left of your body hair abruptly melts away as you shift in your chair again. <br />
<br />
16) If you were a girl... how athletic would you be?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Massively athletic, but it does not reflect body composition and your body shifts, muscles melting away in some spots and increasing in others. You were a cheerleader, after all, and that required a lot of athletic skill. Not to brag or anything, but your coach had already told you you were good enough to cheer at the college level!  <br />
<br />
17) If you were a girl.. would you like to go shopping?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Yes. Of course you loved shopping? You’d liked it…..err, before, when you were shopping for like, sports stuff and movies and whatever, but now you just loved it! The mall had so much amazing stuff, like clothes, and shoes, and makeup! <br />
<br />
18) If you were a girl... How smart would you be?<br />
You frown a little as you circle D] A giggling bimbo. The survey didn’t have to be, like, rude. Yeah you didn’t do well in class, but that was, like, because you found a lot of them totes boring. When it was something you actually cared about—like that assignment for art class where they had you do drawings of various outfits—you’d done really well! Besides, being a little ditzy never hurt anyone, right?<br />
<br />
19) If you were a girl... would you drive?<br />
You circle  C] No and, glancing across the room, give Gavin another wink. Your hunky boyfriend drove you around most of the time, and when he didn’t you could always catch a ride with one of your friends. <br />
<br />
20) If you were a girl... would you dress very girly?<br />
<br />
You giggle a little as you circle A] Yes, always and abruptly glance back up at the front of the room. Lucky for you, the boring old teacher seems as oblivious to the class as ever. You knew Gavin teased you a little for being such a girly girl, but a girl’s got to look her best, right? <br />
<br />
21) If you were a girl... would you have an I-phone?<br />
You circle B] Yes, last year&#39;s model and pour a little. It was soooo unfair that your parents hadn’t agreed to buy you the new model, but at least the old one worked pretty well still, and was so good for taking selfies. <br />
<br />
22) If you were a girl... would you be well liked? <br />
<br />
You circle B] Yes, well-known. You’re a cheerleader after all! Like, obvi you weren’t the head cheerleader or anything, but people knew who you were, and you weren’t, like, total bitch to them like some girls you could think of. <br />
<br />
23) If you were girl... would you have the same friends?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Yes, and make new friends too, kinda confused by the question. Of course you were still friends with the people you’d known since freshman year—that’s when you met Gavin, after all—but since you’d become a cheerleader you’d made so many new friends too! <br />
<br />
<br />
24) If you were girl... would you have the same hobbies?<br />
<br />
You frown and circle  B] No, just new hobbies. You had faint memories of what you’d liked……uh, like, before? But they didn’t seem real, like a totes weird dream or something. You liked your new hobbies, like fashion design, and shopping, and cheerleading. <br />
<br />
25) If you were a girl... would you be rich?<br />
<br />
You circle B] No, but you have a credit card. Your family wasn’t super rich, but, like, they still spoiled you with stuff like a credit card and last year’s iPhone. You circle C] No for the next question; from what you can remember from before, you room isn’t any larger. <br />
<br />
27) If you were a girl... who would remember your previous life?<br />
<br />
Your memories had faded really super fast. It felt more weird to think that you’d, like, ever been some boy than it did to think of yourself as a girl now. Glancing around the room, you can see that nobody noticed the changes or they’d be, like, totes freaking out. For some reason the changes felt perfectly normal to you though, so you circled B] No one. The room seemed to fall completely silent for a second as a low hmm started, seemingly from nowhere. You notice a glazed look in the students around you’d eyes—even more than usual with this teacher started, like, going on about this totes pointless stuff—and you figure reality is, like, changing. <br />
<br />
You glance down at the next question: 28) If you were a girl... would you have memories of your past as a girl?<br />
<br />
And to your shock see that B] Yes, just these memories has been circled. <br />
<br />
Although you didn’t, like, do anything? Your memories of before are now so faint you can’t really remember anything anyway. Memories of always having been a girl are like, totes taking their place super fast. Your head spins as hundreds and thousands of new memories replace the old ones. Cheerleading, sleepovers, trying on prom dresses, going on dates with Gavin…..its all so overwhelming until suddenly, like someone flipped a switch, they seem like the most normal thing in the world. Of course those are your memories!  What other memories could there be?<br />
<br />
29) If you were a girl... how many languages would you know?<br />
<br />
You circle C] English and French. French had actually been one of the classes you’d found interesting, you sooooo wanted to go to Paris someday. You’d bought this super sexy French maid costume for Halloween the other year too, and you speaking French while wearing it really turned Gavin on he said. <br />
<br />
30) If you were a girl... how much clothes would you have? <br />
<br />
You circle A] Enough to fill a walk in closet the size of a full bathroom. You were a bit of a shopaholic obvi, it was just soooo much fun! <br />
<br />
31) If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
You circle B] Tampons. Some things were just down to personal choice, you think with a shrug. <br />
<br />
32) If you were a girl... would you prefer to wear tight or lose clothing? <br />
<br />
You circle A] Tight, show off those curves, and your top and skirt both tighten, fitting you like a glove. You loved to dress to impress, and you loved how Gavin(and all the other boys, of course, but as long as they didn’t say anything totes creepy or try to get you to cheat you didn’t mind if they watched)  couldn’t keep his eyes off you as you strutted around. <br />
<br />
33) If you were a girl... what voice part would you sing?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Spectacular Soprano, and A] Yes for the second part as well. You didn’t really sing, but your high pitched voice meant that you could do soprano if, like, you wanted to. <br />
<br />
35) If you were a girl... would you be more sympathetic?<br />
<br />
You circled A] Yes. You couldn’t stand those girls who acted like, total bitches for no reason, and guys being jerks was suuuuuch a turn off. You knew you were a bit of an airhead sometimes, but that didn’t mean you couldn’t be nice to people!  <br />
<br />
36) If you were a girl... would you be funny?<br />
<br />
You circle B] Sometimes. You make jokes sometimes, but you never know how much they are like, funny and how much people are just laughing because you are totes hawt and they want you to like them. <br />
<br />
37) If you were a girl... how fashionable would you be?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Very fashionable. You pay suuuuper close attention to the fashion magazines, and you always make sure your outfits look great. That’s half the fun, after all! <br />
<br />
38) If you were a girl... would you sleep with a bra?<br />
<br />
You circle A] No. Just like the tampon question, it was just a matter of personal preference to you. <br />
<br />
39) If you were a girl... would you be artistic?<br />
<br />
You circle B] Yes, you do very well with art projects. You really loved the art class project which focused on making drawings of your favorite outfits, and the teacher said you had, like, a ton of talent! <br />
<br />
40) If you were a girl... would you act more sexy?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Yes, of course! Even though you have a boyfriend, you love the attention you get from boys, and sometimes you get a little naughty and flirt a little. It doesn’t hurt anyone, after all—it’s not like you’re going to actually do anything with anyone other than Gavin. <br />
<br />
41)If you were a girl...what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
You circle A] Blue; you’ve always thought your eyes were such a pretty shade of blue. <br />
<br />
43) If you were a girl... would you be good at Videogames?<br />
<br />
You circle B] Pretty bad. Gavin let’s you play his games sometimes, but with no practice you aren’t very good at them. The one exception is Madden, which you are, like, soooo good at! You even won the tournament Gavin and his friends put together last summer, which annoyed him to no end.  <br />
<br />
44) If you were a girl... your name would be...<br />
<br />
You blank for a second, then giggle. You can be such a ditz sometimes! Obvi your name is Nicole, but you go by Nikki! <br />
<br />
The survey finished, you glance up at the clock. Finally the class was over! As you get ready to head out…..</p>
