<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She had awoken like she normally did. Listening as their mother pounding on her brother&#39;s bedroom door, followed by her statement of, &quot;Get up. I don&#39;t want any of your nonsense this morning, young man,&quot; which was followed by their dad telling him to do as their mother said, she knew that in a moment mom would be knocking on her door.<br />
<br />
Light clockwork, the knock came at about a minute or so after, followed by her mom calling out, &quot;You up?&quot; to which Ashley affirmed that she was.<br />
<br />
A yawn escaped her and she slowly sat up. Still shrugging off the sleep, Ashley blinked and stared about her room. Not really taking in anything, as she had seen the same room for nearly all her life, and that the only that had really changed was how she decorated it, she eventually pushed back the comforter and stood. Stretching, her loose belly t-shirt dropping off one shoulder in the process as it rose up almost to the point of showing the part of her breasts, Ashley stumbled across her room and sat in front of her vanity.<br />
<br />
Nowhere near awake enough to do anything, she slouched and stared down at the tight sleeper shorts she was wearing, and again, not really seeing anything. Her mind on the day ahead, she thought about cheerleader practice, her plans to hangout with her friends after school, the homework she still hadn&#39;t finished that was due today and what excuse she could give that would be plausible as to why she hadn&#39;t. Suddenly aware of a commotion out in the hall, she glanced in the direction of her bedroom door, certain Jacob had done something stupid, again, and now their mom was tearing him a new one.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if it is really bad, dad will come down on him,&quot; Ashley thought pleasurably as she imagined what sort of trouble her brother had likely caused.<br />
<br />
Still focused on her attempt to hear what was going on, she was surprised when she soon her their father&#39;s voice. Wanting to know about what Jacob had done this time, Ashley shifted and toyed with the idea of creeping across her room, opening the door and a crack and finding out. Instead, she remained seated at her vanity, listening the near hushed voiced of her parents, curious as to why she hadn&#39;t heard Jacob, who she knew, if he was in trouble, would have started talking hollering by now.<br />
<br />
Her inquisitiveness eventually winning her over, Ashley stood and tiptoed across her bedroom. Opening the door a smidge, she peered out into the hallway and immediately watched as her parents ran past and toward the stairway. Her father she could see was holding something wrapped in a blanket and it took her a moment before she realised that it was her brother. Thinking, &quot;That&#39;s not possible. That&#39;s just a kid,&quot; she missed what their mom said as she stepped out of her room and trailed after, stopping at the top of the stairs, she stared down, confused as to how the little boy their dad was holding was her brother.<br />
<br />
Sleep still heavy in her voice, Ashley called after them, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; as their mom and dad reached the bottom of the steps and headed for the backdoor.<br />
<br />
Their mother calling out that she should worry about and that they were taking Jacob to the hospital, Ashley listened as the backdoor slammed shut and, after a couple minutes, the sound the family car leaving. Still standing at the top of the stairs, confused by what had just happened and what she&#39;d seen, Ashley slowly turned and as if in a trance, headed for the upstairs bathroom.<br />
<br />
There, she shut the door, stepped in front of the mirror and began to examine her reflection. Searching for any blemishes, thinking that she might as well take a shower and start to get ready for school, she stopped when she saw a hunk of metal sitting on the sink. Her thoughts drifting to her brother as she started to come around to the point where she believed what she&#39;d saw, Ashley picked up the bit of metal. Certain it was a piece of junk left there by her brother, she groused, &quot;Stupid Jacob. Always leaving his stuff around. Doing stupid nerd stuff. And now he&#39;s somehow turned himself into a kid,&quot; and absently bouncing the chunk of metal in the palm of her hand, she turned her attention back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Something on her chin catching her attention, she leaned closer to the reflective device. Her hand closing tightly around the metal thing, her anger at her brother and what she perceived as his stupid habits growing, she studied her chin. Hoping she wasn&#39;t getting a blemish, she huffed and whispered, &quot;Stupid, lucky, Jacob. Getting to be a kid again. I would love to be seven-years-old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abruptly as it had happened before, Ashley stumbled back from the sink as her balance violently shifted. Almost falling on her ass, she dropped her bit of metal, which bounced then rolled behind the toilet, and stared stupidly at the sink. Her line of sight having dropped, it took her a moment before she realised that somehow she&#39;d dropped from her normal height of about five foot five down to an inch or two short of four feet. Her shorts and underwear puddling on the floor at her feet, Ashley slowly looked down and shifted uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
The movement causing her belly shirt to drop fully off the one shoulder, she watching as it fell to the floor, joining the rest of her pyjamas. Staring at her naked body, unable to grasp what had happened, she squeaked out, &quot;What they fuck?!&quot; then clapped a hand over her mouth the instant she heard her voice.<br />
<br />
Frightened, she slowly looked at the sink and the mirror high above. she hastily began scrambling up onto the sink. Finally managing to get up in front of the mirror, Ashley made another squeaking noise as she peered into the reflective device. Shaking her head, refusing to accept what she was seeing, she wailed, &quot;What?&quot; &quot;How?&quot; before tightly shutting her mouth, still finding it disturbing to hear the voice of a little girl.<br />
<br />
Her lip starting to tremble as the fear she washing over grew, she found she could no longer stand it. Screaming out, &quot;I&#39;m a little girl. I&#39;m me when I was little,&quot; she then began to cry hysterically.</p>
