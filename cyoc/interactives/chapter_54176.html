<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"I wish you didn't come home just now, but will instead come home in one hour," Rebecca partly growled at her mother as she vanished from view with the door slamming itself shut right in front of her.  "Now… this shouldn't be too hard.  Is the stone screwing wishes up on purpose?  Yeah, a little bit… I got that from wanting to know what is going on," she theorized, trying to work out the logic.  "Like a genie a lamp… just not <i>as</i> mean… Randell was just a fucking twit.  Let's see if I can do better," she said, taking a deep breath and heading upstairs.</p>

<hr>

<p>Dinner had been quite a chore, but not as much as helping with the dishes afterward.  Apparently Randell had two loving parents, which was more than he probably deserved.  As the little girl sat down in her room, the door shut, she put the stone next to her as she thought over what she was going to wish for.  The truth was she <i>knew</i> a wish actually had to be spoken, but she didn't want to risk it going off because of her thoughts.</p>

<p>Time passes, and she made a couple of quick notes to herself.  There were perhaps ways around what had been done as there always seemed to be that when it came to magic in stories.  She'd never changed her body, and she'd never changed his, so those wishes were all free up… and if she made it so that she didn't need the stone to make some changes to a person, then all the better.</p>

<p>"I wish that my current body would turn into an exact duplicate of the body I use to have as the skateboarder from earlier today a few minutes before Randell switched bodies with him," she said, taking a risk on that.  Sure enough, almost instantly her body shot up to Jeff's old height, her little girl chest filling out into his muscled male size, her little vagina inverting and pushing itself back out into his penis and testicles, and finally changing her face to look like Jeff's old face.</p>

<p>Smiling, Jeff stood up and walked over to the mirror at the desk and took in his appearance.  "Still can't remember who I was… wonder if that will matter or if I will just have to be stuck with amnesia my whole life," he sighed.  "No matter.  First step done… time to work the next portion out," he nodded, clenching the stone in his hand.</p>

<p>"I wish that Randell, in the body of the skateboarder I use to be, would appear in front of me now and be held in a locked bear cage and unable to speak until I say 'you are free to go' at which point the cage will be gone and he'll be able to speak again," Jeff said, shaking his head a bit as he tried his damnedest not to screw this up.  <i>One wrong word and I'm no better than he is,</i> Jeff thought as he looked up at Randell whose body was identical to his own now.</p>

<p>"I wish that my family as Rebecca, and everyone else in the world, would remember me Rebecca with the same birth year as boy in front of me," he said, "Even though that's not her 'normal' age," he noted, smiling to Randell as his eyes went wide, trying to reach out to Jeff and the stone.</p>

<p>"I wish that the boy in this cage in front of me would become female… and become in appearance and biology the last female I want him to be when I say 'Rebecca, you are' and finish that with a description of the form I want her to appear as," he said with a smile towards Randell in Jeff's body.  Slowly the features of Randell in Jeff's body smoothed out into curves and though he looked like a manly woman, his breast size and round hips would claim otherwise.</p>

<p>"I wish that whatever form the girl in front of me takes from now on as the female she is… that the appearance <i>of</i> that girl when she was last <i>human</i> is exactly what everyone else in the world remembers Rebecca looking like," he grinned, stiffing a laugh.</p>

<p><i>Think I've got it,</i> he thought to himself as he smiled at Rebecca who was now banging on the cages.  <i>In my new body as Rebecca I made myself a copy of the boy I use to be.  I've got the bastard who swapped bodies with me stuck here until I say otherwise.  I wished that the whole world would remember Rebecca the same age as the girl in front of me because we're going to be boyfriend and girlfriend.  I've made it so I can change her appearance without the wishing stone, and also so that I could make her into an animal or something if I wanted,</i> he nodded to himself, rubbing his chin.</p>

<p>"Be my girlfriend and we wont have to be enemies," he said to Randell as he walked over to the his bedroom window and looked around, realizing everything still looked as if Rebecca was six.  "I wish all records would now reflect that Rebecca was born in the same birth year as the girl in the cage in this room," Jeff smirked, looking over at Rebecca.  "I'm going to let you out of there… You hurt me, and I'll make you pay," he said, holding the stone out the window.  "You understand?"  Rebecca nodded.  "You are free to go," he said, and with that the cage vanished and she could speak.</p>

<p>"How did you&#151;"</p>

<p>"What is your name?" Jeff asked.</p>

<p>"What?" Rebecca blinked, "Randell Cunningham."</p>

<p>"Rebecca Cunningham," Jeff corrected.  "And I mean me.  You made it so I can't remember being who I was before.  If you don't tell me who I was before, then I'll do something nasty to you," Jeff explained.</p>

<p>"Jeff Adams," Rebecca said, and then proceeded to fill in Jeff with everything she had gleaned from Jeff's friends so far.</p>

<p>"You screwed up your life, Rebecca, and then tried to fuck me out of mine.  How fucking rude," he frowned at her.  "Rebecca, you are blonde haired with straight hair coming off your head and stopping about the middle of your back, about five foot ten inches tall, and an athletic woman with a breast size large enough to be the envy of most of the girls at school," Jeff told Randell.</p>

<p>Never before had Jeff seen anything like it.  Randell's form slowly filled out from the partly mannish looking woman in front of him to something befitting the description that Jeff had just spoken aloud.  He nodded to her, and smiled.  "I could have just made you love me, remember… but I didn't.  You get to remember being a guy, being Randell, and trying to steal my life away from me… but in return I want you to be my girlfriend or else I'll turn you into some female animal and sell off your litters for profit," Jeff said to her.</p>

<p>"I did this so many times… how do you know this all will work for you, huh?" She pleaded.  "I didn't mean for any of this to happen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about <i>any</i> of this," Jeff assured her.  "I have no idea any of what I just did is going to work.  But you know what?  I don't care.  Fuck you.  I can't remember my life from before, and I'll be <i>damned</i> if I'm going to give a shit what it does to your life <i>or</i> mine.  Right now, you're what everyone remembers Rebecca to look like.  Since the world already changed for that earlier today, you should have <i>some</i> idea how to play that up.  Me, I have to go <i>fake</i> being friends with people I actually <i>was</i> friends with me until you took my life away!" he tried not to yell, knowing Rebecca's parents were downstairs asleep.</p>

<p>Turning towards the window, Jeff stepped outward to the nearby tree in the front yard to climb his way back down.  He headed off towards the home that Rebecca had told him about as he held onto the stone still.  Before sliding it into his pocket, he looked at it again, and then back towards the house he'd come from.  "I wish that even if Rebecca's mad about the current situation that once she falls asleep tonight she will have dreams of me as I appear now having sex with her over a three dozen times with just moments between each go even as she transforms into different woman during each rest period and that when next she wakes she'll think back that amazing night and how much she enjoyed it, even if she's might be afraid to ever admit it to anyone but herself that the dream was <i>epic</i>," Jeff smirked, making his way home.</p></p>
