<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took Jennifer a heck of a ton of effort to get her ass to the first floor. Holding her belly wasn’t the most easiest task in the world as the baby inside her gave gut more weight than it should have. Jennifer descended the stairs one step at the time and arrived at the gates of no-return. Once she opens that door she would become year younger and there was no way getting back.<br />
<br />
“Oh god! Ah! Ah! AH!”<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard her mother moaning on the other side of the door. In that moment Jennifer’s legs begun to tremble and she realized that she was going to make a mistake if she opened the door. Going further back in time would just fuck her life more and she was happy at her current lifestyle. Maybe the baby could be sent to her grandmother or she could think a better plan the next day.<br />
<br />
“Peter please! Not in my ass! No one hasn’t claimed my ass virginity! Peter no! Don’t do it!”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s body trembled as she heard her mother’s lustful words. Instead of fear Jennifer felt excitement and started to remember the night when she got pregnant. A mental block was cleared in her head as she remembered being at the same place masturbating to her mother’s moan as one of her customers had gone rough with her mother. Nine months ago Jennifer had tip-toed from her room to her mother’s bedroom, stolen one of her used condoms and spread it’s fresh contents inside her vagina without thinking. Only four months later her mother had realized what Jennifer had done as the small bump was visible enough for her mother to notice. Jennifer hold her head. It had to be a bad dream. She would never do that to herself.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Ah! AH! AH! My ass is not a toy! AH! Gentle! Gentle! Be gentle god-dammit! AH! AH!”<br />
<br />
The noises from the other side of the door got louder as Jennifer had to masturbate. Jennifer sat down next to the closed door and begun to think how hot it would have felt if she had a pizza man of her own. Jennifer’s perverted imaginary wanted her to be mother and take care of her own baby. She was like an addicting searching for another hit and she didn’t care if she got pregnant. That’s what she wanted in the end.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was lost in her imagination and didn’t notice how long she had been sitting there. Jennifer heard someone approaching the door and as it swung open a man made eye contact with Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“Hey! There’s a pregnant kid behind your door. Is it yours?” The man turned his head around and asked from Jennifer’s mother.<br />
<br />
“WHAT!? A Kid!? JENNIFER!!!” Sylvia shouted from the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard her mother angrily stumbling in her room as Jennifer tried to sprint away from the scene. The man was surprised to see when exhausted Sylvia raised her fist and rambled angrily at her daughter for disobeying her as Jennifer ascended the stairs back to her room.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s emotional brain kicked into second gear as she was disgusted at herself. Why was she so stupid and let herself get caught like that. Why did she have to go down the stairs in the first place. Now her mother knew about Jennifer’s secret feeling and it made her sad. Jennifer’s mother didn’t understand that she wanted to be just like her. She wanted to have sex with the same pizza men as like her mother did and she wanted to have her own kid.<br />
<br />
Jennifer closed her room’s door and Jennifer’s mental state returned back to more mature and relaxed. She looked at the door and wondered if the day had already changed. No the room looked similar as it did moments ago. How did she end up back in her room as seconds ago she was in front her mother’s master bedroom’s door. Some weird was going on as Jennifer’s hand trembled. Her body was forbidding her to go outside for the night. Jennifer wondered if she was going to finally grow year older as she hadn’t done anything offensive.<br />
<br />
Jennifer laid on her bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning the cycle was still continuing it’s spiraling movement downwards. Jennifer was sure that she didn’t do anything that could have caused her any trouble. So why was she getting younger every night. Jennifer’s belly was the same size it was yesterday but as Jennifer had shrunken down and got younger. The belly appeared and felt much bigger for her.<br />
<br />
On the side of Jennifer’s bed she found a small cardboard shoe box that read in beautiful cursive text, “Jennifer’s stash”.<br />
<br />
The box’s lid was open and there was a lot of weird stuff inside it that Jennifer couldn’t imagine finding from it. A hemp choker, handheld tape recorder with small microphone and headphones, three tapes labeled “night sounds and more”, henna tattoos, two washable markers, bottle of used lube, condoms, strong painkillers, a butt plug with heart on it’s other end and few of hundred dollar bills. Jennifer felt something touching her foot as she moved under the blanket. Jennifer revealed a rubber dildo that was pointing to her crotch. It was evident from it’s size that the dildo belonged to her mother and that Jennifer must have “borrowed” it from her for her own use.</p>
