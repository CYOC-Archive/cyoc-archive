<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, my, god!&quot; Erin you have got to see this,&quot; a female voice squealed out and as there was a second flash I turned about and found myself looking at my sister's best friend, Beatrice, who was holding a camera that I remembered that she had always gone about with when she had still been Erin's best friend, all the way up to the beginning of high school.<br />
<br />
A second voice, one I recognised with horror was Erin's, asked, &quot;What is it,&quot; as I suddenly found myself facing my sister, who took one look at me, looked at Beatrice to say something and glancing back at me, a mixture of emotions flashing across her face as she sputtered out, &quot;What the hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marching into her room to confront me, she spat out, &quot;What the hell do you think you are doing, you little freak!&quot; and pointing at the clothes I was wearing, she hissed out, &quot;Why are you wearing my clothes? Do you get off on some perverse fantasy? Do you want to be a girl and this is the only way you can get off on your feelings,&quot; a pause and then, &quot;What? Do you masturbate while wearing my clothes, is that it? Do think of me in some sick, sexual fantasy? What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, I stood there, shame and embarrassment washing over me as Erin continued to rave and after a moment, she stated, &quot;I'm going over to the Lutz's and get mom and dad. They can deal with you,&quot; and turning, she started to leave.<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly, I moved forward and called out, &quot;Wait! Please don't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why shouldn't I?&quot; Erin nearly screamed out, spinning about and casting me with a look of peer loathing and disgust as Beatrice focused on me with her camera and took another picture.<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, I sputtered out, &quot;Because, because, well it was sort of a dare and, uh, I was thinking of dressing this way for hallowe'en and um, I, well,&quot; and faltering when I saw that Erin was not buying what I was saying, I hastily thought of different things to tell her, came up with nothing and then blurted out, &quot;Please don't tell mom and dad. I'll do anything. Anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another bright flash from Beatrice's camera and Erin crossed her arms across her chest, glaring at me as a look of thoughtfulness crossing her face. After a moment, she stated, &quot;Anything?&quot; and when I nodded, she turned her head and glanced and Beatrice for a couple seconds and I saw the other girl smile for a split second, then Erin was glaring at me again, saying, &quot;Beatrice and I need to talk in private. You will wait here, not moving and do not touch anything else of my stuff. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and as Erin left, I felt a wash of relief spill over me and hugging myself, realising that I looked exactly like Erin when I did that, I dropped my arms to my side and began to fiddle with the skirt I was wearing, attempting to come up with some idea to get myself out this mess and wondering at the same time what it was that Erin planned to do.<br />
<br />
And then it hit me. Beatrice had not gone on holiday with us that summer. &quot;In fact,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;Erin never even had a friend named Beatrice. Her friends had always been Nancy and Terri. Ever since the first grade,&quot; and feeling suddenly confused about this, I hugged myself a second time and thought over how this was possible, coming only to the conclusion that it must be something to do with the Choose Your Own Change website and how strange things came about and how the characters often do not know about this change that came about to be a part of their lives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice and I have given it careful thought,&quot; Erin suddenly announced, distracting me from my thoughts and focusing on my sister, I listened as she said, &quot;And we have come to a conclusion. For the next two days, while mom and dad are off with Mr and Mrs Lutz, you are to do as Beatrice and I command. You are to go about as a girl and not say or do anything to give away that you are actually a boy. You will dress how Beatrice and I want and not complain. If you fail to comply with these terms, and any others that we decree are appropriate, we will come up with a different form of punishment. One such possibility being that we will simply tell mom and dad and let them deal with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stunned, I merely stood there, realising that Beatrice was not with Erin, but before I could say anything to this fact, Erin stated, &quot;I take your silence as compliance. Good. Now strip!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback at all that was happening, for a moment I could not comprehend what it was Erin was saying and stating, &quot;Huh?&quot; I dropped my arms to my side as Erin explained, &quot;Well I cannot really having you going about wearing my clothes. It is not really appropriate. But that should soon be remedied as soon as Beatrice gets back with the few items she has gone to collect. Besides, it isn’t like I haven’t seen you naked before. Remember? I used to help mom change your diapers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Humiliated at the last comment, I thought desperately once again for a way out of the situation I was slowly realising that I was stuck in and that there was no way out, I took a deep breath and pulling up on the shirt, I listened as Erin giggled a bit and asked, “Are those my inserts? You do know what the point of those are, right?” and when I shook my head, tossing her the shirt as I did so, Erin giggled again and said, “They are designed to naturally allow a minute amount of feminine hormones to be absorbed into the skin and as a result, stimulate breast growth,” and giggling more at my look of horror, she watched as I hastily pulled the inserts out, tossed them onto the shirt she had let fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
 As I undid the bra, Erin caught sight of my chest and burst out with “Isn’t that cute. Little sissy boy has breast buds. Perhaps sissy boy hopes they will develop into a pert set of breasts that all men will ogle at,” and then lapsed into a fit of all out laughter.<br />
<br />
Feeling discomfort at my growing situation, I start to take off the skirt, but stop when Erin approaches me and began to run a hand through my hair, she stopped giggling for a moment and asked, “So did you grow this out because you wanted to look even more like a girl or because some of reaction to wearing my inserts?” before she started to once again began to cackle.<br />
<br />
As I watched Erin continue to laugh, I mentally shrugged it off and swore that if I could get out this, I would never ever dress in clothes appropriate for the opposite sex and gender as I slowly pushed down the skirt, which caused my sister to lapse into a fresh peal of laughter when she saw my penis and testicles still tucked between my legs, and shifting about so that my genitals were no longer tucked back, I kicked aside her dress and told, “All right. You have had you laugh, but can we get this over with,” as I heard a door open and close somewhere else within the house.<br />
<br />
Immediately Erin sobered up and simply glared at me and for a moment, I thought that my flippancy had cost me something, but after a moment she smiled and as Beatrice walked in holding a cardboard box, she stated, “I think we are going to change a few things,” and turning to look at her best friend, she asked, “Did you get the stuff?”<br />
<br />
A nod from Beatrice and as she dropped the container on the bed, she explained, “I got what you asked for and bit extra. Hopefully my parents will not notice stuff missing from the shop.”<br />
<br />
Erin nodded and moving toward the box, she explained, “We are going to things a little differently, if that is all right,” and as Beatrice shrugged, Erin began to take various articles of clothing out of the box, all of which I noticed were for a female. And then I received a jolt when she took from the box a pink harness, collar and leash and turning to me, she tossed me the harness and told me, “Put it on.”<br />
<br />
Catching the object, I looked at it, saw how it went on, but also realised that there was no way it could fit me. Pointing this fact out to Erin, I watched her shrug and as I turned my attention to the other two objects she was holding, I barely heard when Beatrice explained, “There should be no problem with the fit. It is sort of a ‘one size fits all’ deal.” To which Erin said, “It is either this or Beatrice goes back to her parent’s shop and chooses something different. Something worse…”<br />
<br />
Not liking the implications of this, I sighed and began to struggle into the harness as Erin and Beatrice conversed in hushed whispers amongst themselves. When I had the harness on, my sister gushed out, “Look how cute Alexis looks in her harness,” to which Beatrice answered that I did.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, hating that I was standing naked in front of my sister and friend, I demanded, “Okay. So now what? Can I have some clothes?”<br />
<br />
Erin and Beatrice looked at each other and as Beatrice smiled, Erin looked at me and stated, “What a silly thing to ask. Ferrets do not wear clothes,” and before I could stop her, she walked towards me and fixed the collar around my next and snapped the leash to a clip on the back of the harness.<br />
<br />
The moment I heard the ‘snik’  as the leash clipped in place, I immediately doubled over in pain and for a moment, I could have sworn I heard a grinding noise coming from within my body. But then, just as fast as it came about, the pain past and the grinding noise stopped and finding myself lying on the floor, I attempted to stand, not liking that my sister and her best friend were suddenly treating me like some animal rather than a human being.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, I found that I could not stand up on two legs anymore and the more I tried, the more Erin and Beatrice laughed and my sister commented, “Look, at, that. Isn’t that cute? She thinks she’s peoples and is trying to walk on two legs.”<br />
<br />
Humiliated, I flopped back to the floor and looking up at my sister and her friend, hating both and wondering how else this could get any worse, I attempted to tell them off and demand that they undo whatever it was that they did, but stopped after only a couple words when it suddenly dawned on me that all that was coming out of my mouth was a combination of barks, hisses and screeches.<br />
<br />
Upset about this, wanting to cry, I attempted to communicate again, but suddenly found myself going quiet when Erin told me, “Be quiet, Alexis,” and lapsing into silence, I glanced about the room from my position on the floor, trying to figure out a way to get out the situation, paying not the least bit attention to what Erin and Beatrice where saying and doing because except for select words, I could not understand what they were saying.</p>
