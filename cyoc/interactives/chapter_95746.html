<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to accept George&#39;s challenge.  You knew you had a great stomach capacity, which was constantly being tested, and you really wanted George to change into something less... entrancing.  Though, you insisted on waiting for Colby and Rani so the four of you could go together.  There was no way you wanted to go anywhere alone with George as he was.  His slender figure, well-endowed chest, and voluminous hair were getting to be too much for you to handle.  It was bad enough you had to hide your crotch nearly every time you were in a room together.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the four of you pack into the van and make your way to town.  Colby makes you sit in the back with George, and gives the passenger seat to Rani.  You watched the way they looked at each other and smiled.  Damn.  The more you watched them, the more you agreed with George; there was something going on between them.<br />
<br />
Rani smirks at George as the van bounces along the mountain road.  &quot;How come every time I see you guys, you&#39;re up to something weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
George grins and leans back into his seat.  &quot;Weird?  It&#39;s just a burger joint.&quot;  He shifts his legs, causing his knee to bump yours.  The contact gives you shivers.<br />
<br />
Rani gives George a look.  &quot;Yeah, but a burger eating challenge?  I swear, it&#39;s always food with you guys.&quot;  She raises an eyebrow at you.  &quot;Well, usually with you.  George just likes to watch, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glance at George and notice a redness creep into his smooth cheeks.  He laughs nervously.  &quot;What?  What do you mean?  Hey!  Rani, how&#39;s that story of yours coming along?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani can tell when someone is trying to change the subject, but she takes the opportunity to fill you two in on her ideas for her story.  She talks about how the mood and feel of a mountain cabin would be more suitable for the tone of her story and how she&#39;s incorporating the changes.  You tune her out and look out at the forest scenery passing by.  The sooner you got the over with, the better.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;If I could have everybody&#39;s attention, please?&quot;  The restaurant owner, a large, rotund man, rivaling George&#39;s father in size, is standing next to your table, mic in hand.  He has a big grin on his fat face as he addresses the small crowd at the burger joint.  You&#39;re seated at a table by yourself, with George eyeing you from a neighboring table, and Colby and Rani sharing a nearby booth.  &quot;This brave soul has accepted our Big Burger Challenge!&quot;  He whispered the word &quot;challenge&quot; several times to make a fake reverb effect.  He turns to you and puts the mic in your face.  &quot;You think you can handle it, big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You glance nervously at George, who winks at you.  &quot;Uh, I&#39;ll certainly try.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man then gestures toward the back of the store, where several wait staff wheel out a monstrous lump of meat between two enormous buns, with every topping imaginable in between.  Your stomach churns just looking at it.  The man grins broadly as the &quot;burger&quot; is plopped down in front of you.  &quot;You have 30 minutes to take down our very own, 3 1/2 pound &#39;Meatagaddon&#39; burger!  Start the clock in 3... 2... 1... Start!&quot;<br />
<br />
You pick up your utensils and begin dismembering the burger as the crowd cheers you on.  You&#39;ve eaten an entire birthday cake before.  How much trouble could this be?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The first few minutes go be smoothly enough.  The other restaurant guests go back to focusing on their own tables, a few glances back at you on occasion to check on your progress.  George and Rani seem to be deeply engaged in conversation as they eat meals of their own, much smaller than yours.  George, who&#39;s sitting by himself, watches you intently the whole time, watching every bite you take.  You feel nervous, having him watch you like this.  Sure, he&#39;s watched you scarf down large quantities of food before, but him being in this body, and what Rani said on the ride over, it all begins to make you feel queasy.<br />
<br />
You continue to eat the enormous &quot;Meatageddon&quot; burger.  Sure, 3 1/2 pounds doesn&#39;t look all that big on paper, but it looks enormous in person.  You glance at the timer.  15 minutes gone, 15 to go.  You were really starting to feel it, now, sitting in your stomach like a rock.  You glance down at your round belly, sitting in your lap.  You take a breath and wipe the mayonnaise and ketchup smeared in your beard.  You glance around to make sure you have as few eyes on you as possible, then reach down and unbutton your pants, releasing some of the pressure.  You pat your stomach, still feeling ill.  You glance up at George, who has his perfect eyebrows raised at you.  Glancing over at Colby and Rani, you can see they aren&#39;t even paying attention.  Colby says something, causing Rani to laugh hysterically.  You take a breath and continue to whittle away at the &quot;Meatageddon&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;5 minutes remain for our challenger!  Will he finish in time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of the &quot;Meatageddon&quot; is gone.  You feel absolutely stuffed, though.  You shove another chunk of meat into your mouth, sick of the taste.  You chew then swallow, feeling the masticated food sluggishly make its way down your gullet.  You groan and hold your bloated gut.  It presses out from your shirt, causing it to ride up, exposing much of its hairy form.  You put your hand to your mouth and fight the urge to toss your cookies.  One of the wait staff rushes over and places an empty 5 gallon bucket next to you.  &quot;In here,&quot; they mutter, before rushing off, again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our challenger isn&#39;t looking so good, folks.  Those of you with sensitive stomachs, look away and cover your ears!  Remember, throwing up during the challenge is a disqualification!&quot;<br />
<br />
You lean over the bucket, feeling the contents of your stomach fighting you.  Though you can&#39;t see him, you can still feel George&#39;s eyes on you, watching your every move.  You really did not want to put up with his womanly wiles any longer.  One week was enough!  From your lower vantage point, you glance over at Colby and Rani&#39;s booth.  They&#39;re looking in your direction, concern plastered on their faces.  Rani grabs Colby&#39;s hand under the table.  Colby blushes furiously.  Why did everything have to be so weird, now?  You came here to relax and have fun, not put up with crazy exes, fall in love, or be attracted to your best friend who was in the body of a woman but was actually a guy.  You&#39;ve had it!  You take a breath, forcing your meal back down.  You sit back up, having avoided vomiting altogether.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;s back up, folks, still in the game!  But he&#39;s only got a couple minutes left!  Can he do it?  Let&#39;s show him some encouragement!  Come on, let&#39;s hear it!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear the crowd start chanting your name.  Some are clapping and hooting.  &quot;You can do it!&quot;  &quot;Come on, you got this!&quot;  You can see George has a grin.  You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s a grin of encouragement, or if he believes you aren&#39;t going to be able to finish it.  You look down at the pile of meat, bread, and toppings remaining on the platter.  It&#39;s roughly the size of a standard hamburger.  You know what you must do.<br />
<br />
You pick up the mass of food and begin shoving into your mouth, devouring it bite by bite, barely chewing it.  Little by little, the mass is shoved in your mouth.  George stares, eyes wide, mouth agape.  He&#39;s impressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s going for it, folks!  We&#39;ve only got less than a minute left!  Can he do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shove the last little bit into your mouth as the crowd begins counting down the seconds.  You chew and chew, mashing down the last bits of the former &quot;Meatageddon&quot;.  You swallow, forcing it down your throat.  You open your mouth and the designated inspector peeks inside, making sure the burger is all gone.  He smiles and nods at the restaurant owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;s done it, folks!  He&#39;s vanquished the &#39;Meatageddon&#39;!&quot;  He grabs your hand, pulling your arm into the air like you&#39;ve won the world heavyweight championships.  Well, at this rate you practically were a heavy weight.<br />
<br />
The crowd cheers, clapping and shouting, congratulating you on your victory.  &quot;This man is only the fourth to take down the &#39;Meatageddon&#39;!  Let&#39;s hear it for him!&quot;<br />
<br />
You blearily look over at George who, despite the fact he lost the bet, is clapping and grinning along with the others.  &quot;Nice job, bro.  I knew you had it in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
You&#39;re given the entire third row of seats to lie on as Colby drives the four of you back to the cabin, taking care to drive as smoothly as possible.  Your stomach bloats painfully outward.  There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll be able to button these pants up any time soon, if ever again.  Your shirt can&#39;t even pull down past your belly button, though, to be fair, it barely fit beforehand.  That&#39;s alright, though.  You&#39;ve been given a commemorative shirt by the burger joint.  It&#39;s a pinkish red and has the name of the burger joint on the front with, &quot;I Took on the Meatageddon and Lived&quot; on the back.  The shirt is an XXL, so it fits you just fine.  You&#39;re half-conscious for the most part for the ride home, though you can hear the three others talking and laughing in the front.<br />
<br />
At some point, George leans over the back of his seat and looks down at you.  It&#39;s dark, but you can just make out a grin highlighted from the lights of the dashboard.  &quot;Nice job, guy.  You won, so you get to pick the shoes.  Anything you got in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
You do, in fact.  You have the perfect pair of shoes in mind for George.</p>
