<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Well, turns out that maybe Cory should have listened to his mother. The sausages and fried eggs he had scarfed down in a hurry without proper mastication had taken their toll on the poor boy’s stomach and now, to put it bluntly, he really had to shit.<br />
<br />
Cory would have to make use of his newfound powers some other time. He clutched his gurgling belly as he made his way to the nearest stall and locked himself in.<br />
<br />
With a strong slamming sound the restroom door broke open. “In we go, faggot...!” Charles and two of his goons entered the dirty restroom, but there was no sight of Cory. The brutish ginger groaned when he saw the six completely closed stall doors. “Stop wasting my time! I know you’re hiding in those!”<br />
<br />
Technically, Cory wasn’t hiding. He was using the stall toilet in the most legitimate way.<br />
<br />
Charles pried open one of the stalls, but he was greeted by an unoccupied toilet. “You know, it’s funny that you’re hiding in there. Shouldn’t you be hiding in the girls’ restroom?” The bully said as he pried another completely empty stall. “Argh!”<br />
<br />
Cory was on the verge of tears. Not only because of the huge log he was trying to squeeze through his virgin anus, but of the imminent pummeling Charles was going to give him. He hoped he could finish his bowel movements before that, at least.<br />
<br />
Charles finally found the stall Cory was hiding in, as he realized this particular door was locked. “Ha! Gotcha!” The bully said triumphantly. “Help me bust this door down, guys!”<br />
<br />
“Damn, this is so humiliating...I don’t want him to see me like this...” thought Cory. He was so scared of the bully he was literally shitting himself.<br />
<br />
As Charles and his goons were getting ready to bust the door down by brute force, Cory’s vision got full of the bluish sparkles once again.<br />
<br />
“EXTERNAL TRIGGER AGENT FOUND.” Said the deep mechanical voice. “HOLD IT FOR FIVE SECONDS TO CONFIRM TRANSFORMATION.”<br />
<br />
“Uh?” Cory was confused. “But...I’m not holding anything...” He muttered as he looked down at his empty hands.<br />
<br />
“TRIGGER AGENT ACTIVATED. INITIALIZING TRANSFORMATION...”<br />
<br />
If Cory had been more sharp, maybe, just maybe, he’d realized the Chronivac didn’t care what body part he used to hold the external trigger. Yes, Cory wasn’t holding any external object with his hands, but both of his buttcheeks were holding a long and smelly trigger...<br />
<br />
“One...Two...!” Cried out Charles as the three bullies prepared to bust down the door.<br />
<br />
“TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE.”<br />
<br />
The entire process had taken less than a second. Before Cory could realize what was happening, he was in mid-air. He looked down and saw his shirt, but he couldn’t see his neck or his arms. It was like he had...shrunk?<br />
<br />
The shrunken Cory fell down through his shirt collar. He was utterly scared. He heard a splashing sound below from the turd he had just shat, and as he fell he realized he was next in line to have a deep dive.<br />
<br />
“Three!” Charles and his goons threw themselves at the door at the same time and the door got pried wide open. But...<br />
<br />
“Uh?!” The bully was completely taken aback with what he saw.<br />
<br />
At the feet of the toilet there were Cory’s sneakers, pants and boxers. On top of the toilet was Cory’s shirt. But the androgynous boy...was nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
“Is he...making fun of us?” Asked one of the goons.<br />
<br />
“No way, did he really just strip out of his clothes as a decoy? What does he gain by that?”<br />
<br />
“Well...” Charles said. “Maybe he ran away while we weren’t looking...”<br />
<br />
The class bell chimed, marking the start of classes.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! What do I tell my English Lit teacher now...” Charles lamented.<br />
<br />
The bullies were about to split out and leave for their respective classes when Charles had an idea. “I know! Let’s take his clothes away! He’s probably hiding in the buff, and he’ll be surprised when he returns and finds out his clothes aren’t there anymore!” The goons nodded, finding the idea of Cory having to streak his way out of school very amusing.<br />
Charles took Cory’s shoes, one of the other goons took his boxers and pants and the remaining goon took the shirt hanging on the toilet and...<br />
<br />
“Yuck! This is fucking disgusting!”<br />
<br />
“What is it?” Asked Charles.<br />
<br />
“Well...they forgot to flush!” The goon answered. “There’s two huge logs in there!”<br />
<br />
“So what?” Charles shrugged as he picked a booger out of his nose.<br />
<br />
The goon looked with utter disgust at the two large (and oddly identical) turds floating on the bottom of the toilet. He thought for a second about flushing, but he and his partners in crime were late for class and he just didn’t stand the stench the pile of poo emitted, so he let them be.<br />
<br />
Cory’s shrunken form heard the bullies leaving and breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness that they didn’t see me...And that they didn’t flush!” Cory thought as he floated on the toilet water.<br />
<br />
It had been a weird experience. He wasn’t sure how he had activated the Chronivac, but thanks to this weird shrinking thing he had been safely hidden from the bullies! Maybe the Chronivac really did want to protect him.<br />
<br />
Although... Something was bugging him...<br />
<br />
Cory looked at the giant turd floating right next to him. It was just this smelly thing and him inside the bowl...<br />
<br />
...But then, why did that goon say ‘There are two huge logs in there!”...?<br />
<br />
Cory looked down at his body. He just saw a dark brown featureless substance...<br />
<br />
Oh...No...No, no, no, NO!!!<br />
<br />
Cory tried to swim away in a panic, but he had no arms or legs anymore. He just wiggled around in the water like a helpless drowning worm.<br />
<br />
Shit, this couldn’t be happening! He couldn’t be *SHIT*!<br />
<br />
“No! This is so wrong! I don’t want to be like this, transform me into something else!”<br />
<br />
“AN EXTERNAL AGENT WASN’T FOUND. ERROR(NoAgent). SEARCHING AGAIN FOR TRIGGER IN 30 SECONDS... THE TIME LIMIT FOR THE TRANSFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN REACHED (29 MINUTES). ERROR(TimeLimitNotReached). SEARCHING AGAIN FOR TRIGGER IN 29 MINUTES...”<br />
<br />
“You’ve gotta be shitting me!” Cory thought in disgust. He didn’t want to be shit for half an hour... Wait...He still needed an external agent in order to transform... How was he gonna find one floating in the bottom of the toilet?!<br />
<br />
“HELP! Someone help me! I’m a fucking piece of SHIT!” Cory attempted to cry out. But he wasn’t even certain he was making any sounds as he didn’t even have a mouth anymore.<br />
<br />
He could wiggle his disgusting smelly log of a body, though.<br />
<br />
He kept splashing around in the water like a fish hoping someone, somehow, noticed the moving piece of shit and correctly assumed it used to be a small slender boy called Cory.<br />
<br />
“No... I can’t be my own shit... This can’t be happening...” Cory wanted to cry, but his featureless brown face didn’t have eyes. “Please... Someone... Something... Help me...”</p>
