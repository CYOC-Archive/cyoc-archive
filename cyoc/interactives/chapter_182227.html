<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Misty&#39;s eyes fluttered open, the dim light of the morning sun, the light passing through her mother&#39;s pouch skin turned the light a faint shade of pink, then she felt one of her baby siblings pressing against her, she didn&#39;t mind shairing mommies comfy place with them but sometimes she wished she had mommy all to herself.<br />
<br />
Misty then felt the world moving, mommy was on the move, hopping carefully through the train towards the canteen, Misty could always tell when mommy was going to that part of the train, she could always smell the cent of her favourite food getting stronger and stronger as mommy hoped closer, waffles, soon she could not wait any longer, and popped her human torso out into the world, her hands holding onto mommies pouch and her paws peeking over the top, her long brown ears pricked up as she herd voices all around her but the most important voice was what she focused on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning my baby girl, you up for breakfast?&quot; Asked Sofia as she hugged Misty with her paws, Misty never spoke, she found that she got her meanings and wants across just fine without talking, but mommy and everyone else always insisted on trying to get her to talk &quot;so baby what do you want for breakfast, mommy will get it for you if you can say it&quot; she said with a grin &quot;now if this doesn&#39;t get her talking nothing will, she can&#39;t resist her waffles in the morning&quot; thought Sofia with a grin, then she felt Misty gently hopped out of her pouch and bounded over to the canteen machine, then looked up at the controlls, way up high and out of her reach, she tried sitting up on her hind legs, her foot thumping the ground repeatedly in frustration, she then looked behind her, seeing mommy&#39;s arms folded and a smug grin on her face, but Misty wasn&#39;t going to give in this easily, she crouched down on all fours, then lept up into the air, using her powerful back legs, then pressed her long ears into the touch screen, hitting the waffles icon, she then began to hop and dance in celebration, clapping and giggling, clearly proud if herself.<br />
<br />
Sofia sighed and rolled her eyes &quot;oh what am I going to do about you&quot; she sighed, then giggled grabbing the plate from the collection box for her daughter, who was looking up at the plate with wide eyes, her nose twitching and her fluffy pompom of a tail shaking back and forth, Sofia laughing at how adorable her baby girl looked as she bent her torso down and handed the plate to Misty, who eagerly grabbed it &quot;thank you mommy&quot; she said with a smile and bounded of towards the lounge, Sofia was shocked, she spoke by herself, without incentive &quot;well at least she has manners&quot; she giggled as her attention turned to her unborn joey&#39;s who also wanted their breakfast, a loud audible growl now emitting from Sofias belly &quot;well kids what shall we have hey?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Misty was now sat in the lounge with a few other people, she was sat on the low sofa bed which hadn&#39;t been folded up, her waffles had been eaten and she was now happily watching some cartoons, giggling with the jokes and slapstick humor, Lina and Viki were sat either side of her, both laying on their sides to give their full wombs the room they needed and their paws a much needed break, another woman  was now coiled around a wooden beam that was high above them, her sand coloured scales glistening in the morning light as she warmed up, being close to the roof gave the girls who were part reptile a way to warm up quickly but still interact with everyone abord, Misty waved to the snake girl, who smiled and waved back before letting her human torso down a bit to talk with a girl who was was part hyena, her human half was a grey rubber with white zebra stripes, her breasts large and transparent, filed to the brim with milk, and like everyone else her human torso was conected where the hyena body&#39;s head should have been, with high shoulders and a white underbelly and paws with sand coloured fur along her back and shoulders, with black stripes across her body, the ends of her white legs ending in black paws, and a long tail at her lower back end.<br />
<br />
But what had Mistys attention on this girl was that her hyena body had large swolen teats along its belly, six in total and some dribbling droplets of milk, then the hyena girl must have felt Mistys eyes on her because her head turned to look at her, her brown eyes stairing caringly at Misty, following her gaze to her swolen teats &quot;you still hungry young one?&quot; She said, her thick African accent in her voice as she walked over to one of the beds and lay on her side, exposing her underbelly to Misty as she lay her torso on the bed as well, she patted the spot infront of her underbelly with a smile &quot;it&#39;s OK little one, don&#39;t be shy&quot; she said as she stretched out and got comfy.<br />
<br />
Misty looked up to Lina for reassurance, Lina nodded &quot;it&#39;s OK baby, if your still hungry go ahead, plus your mommy might be a while, especially trying to feed her brood&quot; she giggled as Misty slowly hopped over on all fours, once she was close to the hyena girls belly she snuggled her bunny body into her fur, getting as close as she could, she then timidly took one of the woman&#39;s teats into her mouth and gave a small tug, immediately being rewarded with warm thick milk, the taste of the milk on her tongue encouraged her to suckle harder, her eyes closing as her paws began kneading at the breast below her instinctively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooohh, when she gets going this one&#39;s got some power behind her&quot; Moaned the hyena girl as she turned to look at Lina and Sofia, &quot; I&#39;m Martha by the way, I work as a feeder in the nursery, if you can tell, she said as she folded her arms under her breasts to lift them, demonstrating her point &quot;probably why you don&#39;t see me around that often&quot; she said blushing, then everyone looked into the rafters as Mazy flapped into the room and perched on the beam across from the lamia, she then began to fiddle with her feathers and every now and then rubb the swell of her egg, the lamia had now slithered across to Mazy&#39;s beam, her body hanging low in the gap between the wooden beams ad the two began chatting, but Misty was focused on her task at hand, she then herd a content sigh from Martha as she reached down to stroke Misty hair and ears, coxing her into a relaxed and tired state.<br />
<br />
Then into the room came.....</p>
