<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice perked up,&nbsp;&quot;If the grotesques are to be called inanimate objects, am I to be <br />
considered an inanimate object? I do not eat or breath in the world outside the mirrors,  <br />
just as they do not. But to be inanimate is to be not alive. Like a cadaver. However, I see, <br />
hear, and I think I think that I think. An object can not do these things. So to say that I am <br />
not alive I dare say is nonsense. So to call myself, or the grotesques inanimate I also dare <br />
say is nonsense.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone present stared at Alice.<br />
<br />
Jensen flung his arms, &quot;Everyone back to what you were doing, pups, Zack, stay here!&quot; <br />
<br />
The she-wolves and minute male wolves started and bowed, &quot;Yes Master!&quot; And they <br />
scattered. <br />
<br />
Jensen turned to see the cream Anne and plain green Beatrice standing there looking <br />
rather unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, that is, you see Master,&quot; Anne spoke first feeling herself trapped in a very awkward <br />
situation, &quot;Beatrice and I were already here when your great-grandfather walked in and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be at the female's den then-.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master!&quot; The two said together and were gone in a blur. <br />
<br />
Martha by virtue of the pups location stayed as well.<br />
<br />
Zack started at hearing that his turn would be used to transform Patrick and now that <br />
Alice had finish her latest dismantling of semantics, &quot;Uh, Jensen, wouldn't one of the other <br />
males be better? After all, they used most of their turns already changing the staff into the <br />
pack I'm told, and to round things out it might better.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said we're using your turn, end of discussion.&quot; Jensen replied flatly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Zackery's paws turned into fists behind his pack and he let out a low growl.&nbsp; His eyes <br />
darted about for a few seconds as thoughts went through his mind. However he said, &quot;Of <br />
course Jensen.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With Patrick out of sight Martha finally let go of the pups tails. Bart rubbed his while Marcy <br />
and Kevin just held their gently, Alice didn't seem to mind. Jenny swung hers back and <br />
forth a couple of times. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why'd you stop us?&quot; Bart asked right at Martha.<br />
<br />
Her heads bowed and said, &quot;Forgive me Master Bart, but Master Patrick -is- a member of <br />
the family, and he was being dealt with already, and I did not wish to see you or him hurt.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He hurt father!&quot; Bart retorted, and all the pups nodded at once. <br />
<br />
Kaylee interjected, &quot;And so did Marcy and Kevin before they came to their right minds, so <br />
there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The black and red pubs bowed their heads, &quot;... yes mother.&quot; &quot;Yes mama.&quot; &quot;Yes Alpha <br />
Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee asked, &quot;So are you sure we can't make him into a busty she wolf Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Submissive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More females to please your desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do so for any other 'extras' talents or workhands the pack finds it needs in the <br />
long run, but we'll be going with the mundane wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With improvement to make it a curious sight?&quot; Alice asked of course. <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed and looked at the glass wolf child, and finally nodded, &quot;-Some- <br />
improvements, I won't have great-grandpa looking like a thing from Dr Seuss.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not father, it would be Lewis Carol.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone should have seen that one coming. <br />
<br />
Kaylee's clink or alt-copies were stood behind her in a flanking position staying silent for <br />
the moment. Hope and Isabelle on her sides and Grace behind her having quite easily filled <br />
into the role of being Kaylee's shadow (NOT in the sense like the ground workers who <br />
were now Bart and Jenny's empty shadow puppets). <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like sitting.&quot; Kaylee said and the three she wolves behind instantly got into a pose <br />
that enabled the three of them to more or less function as a importune chair for their <br />
Alpha Female. Kaylee sat down, and enjoyed the feeling of power over the girls who had <br />
treated her like dirt when she had been Kyle. <br />
<br />
Jensen nor Zackery gave them the slightly bit of attention in the least. Jenny however saw <br />
what her mother did and said, &quot;I feel like sitting.&quot; And Martha sighed but instantly knelt <br />
using her extra arms and two tails for balance and Jenny sat down in her lap on the spot.<br />
<br />
Kaylee saw what her daughter did, smiled and approved, surprised at herself when she <br />
actually felt a mother's pride.<br />
<br />
Alice also thought of sitting down, but didn't know if Martha's legs would hold Alice's <br />
weight on top of her own and Jenny's. <br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;Marcy, Kevin, Alice, work out what you want for your great-great-<br />
grandfather, remember he has to have some years taken off and live long enough opposed <br />
to a mundane wolf to be your guard for the next generation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THANK YOU PAPA!&quot; Marcy and Kevin were surprised and excited at this, figuring this <br />
meant their father really did forgive them for the day before last!  Alice of course just took <br />
the chance with silence enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Martha secretly greatly approved of this idea, since it would mean that she could rely on <br />
Patrick to look after the cubs when they were resting, however Martha did not wish to <br />
speak out of turn.<br />
<br />
Kaylee relaxed in her living throne, thinking how this was the second time one of their <br />
victims had injured her mate.  'I wish he'd stop getting so close...' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's your story?&quot; Patrick asked once his arms and legs were all tied down to a large <br />
chair with a hole in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Started Fran.<br />
<br />
Darla continued, &quot;We were just a couple of cops who got a call about two animals being <br />
too loud, and met Alpha Female at the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She used her turn to make us into the two earliest members of the pack besides herself <br />
and Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... and nobody's questioning you for being furry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla said, &quot;We quit our jobs before our transformation started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was part of the Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister's only regret is some of the things she had to say to Julie.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister's parents don't live in town you see and considered Daryl his own man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myself before I was changed.&quot; Darla said, &quot;I and my sister started out as males, but we <br />
couldn't be happier now to be in a form that master enjoys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sure how Julie would care for me now, but I hope to add her and my daughters <br />
to the pack soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're... just OKAY with all of this?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we are.&quot; Darla laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was part of our Transform for us to be!&quot; Fran giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you're brainwashed and you KNOW you're brainwashed?&quot; Patrick said confused and <br />
alarmed.<br />
<br />
The twins mirrored each other and tilted their heads like in a mirror, &quot;I suppose you could <br />
call it that.&quot; They said as one. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUt we can also see a lot of good this can all be.&quot; Darla said, &quot;We see that if everyone was <br />
a wolf, selflessly working towards the greater good of Master and the pack, just imagine <br />
how little violence and crime there would be! As cops we can appreciate that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all zombie slaves to my great-granddaughter?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran giggled, &quot;You left out 'zombie slaves to your spoiled, uneducated grandson!' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master has vision.&quot; Darla said, &quot;But little else, save of course for down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins sighed at the thought of their two nights together with Master.<br />
<br />
Fran  gesturing with one hand and the other on her hip, the pose mirrored by Darla of <br />
course, &quot;We love Master more than anything, and are loyal to him to the end. But love of <br />
course means to understand and to love one for their warts and all, or it is not in of itself <br />
love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister, I am the poet remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; The twins giggled.<br />
<br />
Darla spoke, &quot;All Master desires are for his earthly needs to be pleased and for his pack to <br />
say how great he is.&quot; She then ran off her fingers, &quot;He's not out to execute those who cross <br />
him, not ordering us to fight to the death for his amusement, we all willing give ourselves <br />
to him so he is not forcing himself upon us, and expects us mostly to just carry on as <br />
normal and to not fight among ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As naked wolf women who will have sex with her on command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The twin said together calmly, &quot;As naked wolf women who will have sex with him on <br />
command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he finds the idea however as you as a she-wolf as just too alien... thus why you're <br />
likely going to lose your thumbs.&quot; Fran said sitting down next to him guard him, Darla <br />
doing the opposite on his other side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT- you're also going to become the guardian of the next generation work along side <br />
our pack's Omega Martha...  consider it an honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick shivered, at least he'd be alongside his granddaughter, or whatever his great-<br />
granddaughter had apparently turned her into...<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Kevin said, &quot;Da time has come for us to decide the precise details of Great-Great-<br />
Grandpa's transformation into a wolfie... and dere's only one way to decide that! Are we <br />
ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Alice and Marcy said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Then let's get started!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin pressed the 'Start' button on his classic controller and the game's voice said, &quot;Ready! <br />
Set! Go!&quot; And the three way battle began.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So was that war as horrid as people say?&quot; Fran asked casually. <br />
<br />
Patrick sighed and said, &quot;No more and no less horrid than any other war and for the record <br />
I never killed a civilian or noncombatant in my life. But it's interesting how the more <br />
people die in a conflict, the more people care -less- about it while it's happening, only <br />
once the history books come around does anyone stop to think, 'a million deaths is a lot of <br />
people.' &quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Callooh! Callay!&quot; Said the victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two outta three!&quot; Said one of the losers.<br />
<br />
The victor reminded the protester, &quot;The deal was one game with three lives each <br />
remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long were you stuck with that bullet in you?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't ask.&quot; Patrick sighed, &quot;Dang thing never stopped hurting and kept hurting for a long <br />
long time after it finally got taken out.&quot; So this was what he was reduced to. Having light <br />
conversation with his two guards who were holding him before his execution. <br />
<br />
At least the anticipation finally came to an end a hour or so later (there wasn't a clock in <br />
the basement) when he saw a couple shapes come onto the doorless portal leading to the <br />
basement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings and good day Great-Great-Grandfather.&quot; Said the glass statue he had seen <br />
before speaking in a child's voice, it mimed a curtsied. Next to it was a charcoal black wolf <br />
creature he had seen talking to his family before. <br />
<br />
The glass statue skipped before down the short steps in front of the charcoal wolf. &quot;I am <br />
Alice. It is quite nice to meet you, since I never had a Great-Great-Grandfather before, and <br />
it is curious to have one now when you did not have one before.&quot; <br />
<br />
Patrick couldn't believe what he asked next, &quot;Do you ever use contractions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not believe so Great-Great-Grandfather.&quot; The glass statue asked innocently. She then <br />
looked at one of the twins, &quot;Hello Mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick asked, &quot;I thought you family wasn't assimilated yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was me.&quot; Said the -other- twin. <br />
<br />
Patrick groaned. What did ANY OF IT matter anyway? <br />
<br />
&quot;So how do we do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice gestured at the big one, Zackery, &quot;Mr. Zackery here will ask you Transform or Dare <br />
like before, if you don't answer in sixty seconds you'll get both. I should tell you though <br />
Great Great Grandfather, that the pack has figured out how to cheat, and just Dares the <br />
person to have the asker repeat the process and take transform next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Then what's the bloody POINT of their being a choice at all-?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded and bowed, &quot;Oh I do so agree Great Great Grandfather... it is quite unfair and <br />
not in the least bit proper. But it is what father wants, and what father gets. And since, as I <br />
have been told, that the game is a curse created by a coven of witched right on the spot of <br />
their execution, they likely did not think to give it many ground rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
Witches? Why not. <br />
<br />
Patrick sighed, &quot;DO I get a last request?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry no. I also find that rather improper and not in the least bit kind, but it is <br />
indeed what father wants, and what father wants, father gets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My one regret that Jennifer and Bart didn't keep me away from Jenny so I could have at <br />
least helped her not to turn out like she did.&quot; Patrick said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no complaints on how he turned out.&quot; Chorused the twins.<br />
<br />
Zackery remained stone silent, his eyes looking almost disinterested in this task, but <br />
Patrick could tell he was upset over something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Zackery, do you or do you not have the Transform memorized?&quot; Alice asked politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do.&quot; Zackery said flatly and sounding slightly agitated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good and thank you, we shall proceed then.&quot; Alice then looked at Patrick, &quot;I do hope you <br />
find it delightful Great-Great-Grandfather, but the curse shall make sure you do one way <br />
or another, so what I said was actually quite pointless was it not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Patrick said bitterly.<br />
<br />
Zackery leaned down and whispered in his ear, &quot;For the record, I didn't want to waste this <br />
on you either...so suck it up monkey!&quot; <br />
<br />
Patrick merely glared back at the giant wolf monster.<br />
<br />
Zackery sighed, with some slight hesitation said, &quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick just wanted it over with. &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a bored monotone Zackery said, &quot;You shall become a four legged wolf who will be at <br />
his biological prime. You will be twice the size of an average North American wolf. You'll <br />
have a pattern of a howling wolf on your fur. You will age slower than a mundane wolf and <br />
live long enough to see our entire next generation mature. You will keep your intelligence <br />
and ability to speak. You shall use your turn only to protect the pups or at the Alpha <br />
Male's command.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You will love the pack and be loyal ... &quot; Zackery sighed looking at the twins with desire in <br />
his eyes, &quot;To The Alpha Male of the Big Bad Wolf Pack. You ultimate purpose in life is to: <br />
love, play with, protect, and guard Bart, Jenny, Kevin, Marcy, Alice, and all of the other <br />
wolves cub who shall be created via the game or born to the pack. None shall remember <br />
you save the pack and it's servicers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course the fur would be the same shade of black as Jenny and Jensen's. The twins did <br />
not cut his bonds at first remembering what happened last time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I go now?&quot; Zackery asked bored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Alice said politely.<br />
<br />
Zack left without another word.<br />
<br />
Patrick felt it all. Years and then decades melting away. At the same time his thumbs <br />
vanishing. His shoulders and hips rearranged themselves. The black fur came up almost <br />
everywhere at once it felt! Then fur the color of gold replaced the black on his melting <br />
hands and shrinking feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;That gold fur on your forehead makes you look distinguished.&quot; Said the twins. Telling <br />
Patrick where else it had appeared. <br />
<br />
His shoes and socks no longer put and Alice calmly pulled them off. Patrick resisted the <br />
urge to kick her in the face, then felt a mental hammer blow at merely having HAD the <br />
urge! <br />
<br />
Finally, as he was beginning to suffer from the twisting his spine against the chair Darla <br />
cut his bounds as Fran held him down as he got bigger and bigger now his bones <br />
expanding and his muscle mass doubled and kept on doubling! He saw a black tail with <br />
gold highlights forms out of his spine and waved madly behind him. He looked at Alice. <br />
Why were they holding him down?! He had to be near her! Protect her! Be with her! Wait! <br />
He didn't want that! Yes he did! No he didn't! Of course he did! He loved his grandchild and <br />
great-great-grandchildren so why not love Alice?<br />
<br />
Patrick began to struggle more under the twins' hard grip as the gold and black wolf got <br />
harder to hold. The twins began stripping him as the clothes torn into his body.  His neck <br />
twisted and made it so looking 'up' was it's natural setting as his 'arms' and 'legs' twist <br />
about so they all faced foreword. His hair of course was long gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;OOoooh, I think that picture in your fur turned out very good indeed.&quot; Said Alice curious <br />
looking at his side as a some final botches of gold fur appeared on his belly and around <br />
the muzzle as it grew out from his face and his teeth became sharp fangs. His hands had <br />
become feet and quickly digigrated as did his original paws. Claws were all that remained <br />
of his finger nails as his ears became relocated triangles and his tail grew to it's full height <br />
as Fran ripped off his underwear. Everything but his wallet going into the furnace nearby <br />
immediately. <br />
<br />
And now only one thought rang through Patrick's mind, 'Why, are they, keeping me, AWAY <br />
FROM HER?!'<br />
<br />
Patrick let out a snarl and with herculean strength born of determination knocked Fran <br />
and Darla -police trained and super human- off him. He then came to Alice who didn't <br />
even flinch at the sight and leaned down his massive head licked her face. She giggled. <br />
Alice stood on her tip toes and scratched the side of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mr. P, let's go see the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick dutifully followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;'S big Sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mighty beast among beasts climbed out of the basement following his glass great-<br />
great-grandchild.</p>
