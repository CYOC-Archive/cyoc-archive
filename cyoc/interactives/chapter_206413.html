<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ron finished grooming and gave himself one final look over as he placed his hair in a fashionable style. //Handsome as ever, stud//, he thought to himself as he winked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He then opened the door to see his younger brother Roger in his pajamas and trying to no avail to hide the anger he was displaying by contorting his face, which was gazing down his body.<br />
<br />
“Come on, bro! The last thing I need is to see that in the morning.” Roger shielded his eyes.<br />
<br />
“That’s what you get for deadnaming me, asshole!” he retorted.<br />
<br />
“Oooh… Excuuuse me, mister princess. Finished trimming your snatch…or were you putting in a tampon?”<br />
<br />
That sent Ron snapping. After Roger’s girlfriend cheated on him, he seemingly had it out for women—including his former “sister”. Despite being a junior, Ron hadn’t begun to date yet, but he still sensed how alone Roger was in his predicament with two gay men for fathers. Women, romantically speaking, were a mystery in the household.<br />
<br />
“Boys, that’s enough!” A new voice—that of Kyle, their father—entered the conversation from across the hall. “Ron, get some damn clothes on. You might be home, but that doesn’t mean you can prance around all willy-nilly. Roger, stop it with the sexist remarks, son. You know how hard it is for your brother. Last thing we need in this family is you two being shipped off to some lab.”<br />
<br />
Having heard that exact threat dozens of times, Roger mocked it by moving his hand like a speaking puppet. Ron looked at his little brother, trying his best not to laugh. Roger closed the door to the bathroom as he began his own morning grooming.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ron was excited for today just because of a package he’d received last night. It contained an order of specialized underwear from a new company, NBFit, whose product line consisted of cuts catering to the needs of intersex people such as himself. When he’d seen it online, he’d found possible relief from the baggy pants he usually wore when he went out—and a headache: they were on the expensive side. Ron saved every scrap from his job waiting patiently for his finances to reach his desired goal and was finally able to order them a week ago. The wait consumed him while the undergarments shipped to his address. He feverishly tracked the package on its route, bouncing across the country. He had almost forgotten until he’d received an email informing him the package had shipped and showing it at the front door. Ecstatic, he made sure to whisk it away before any porch pirates could steal what was his. It was perfect timing. Monday, new week… Why not start the week right and with confidence? <br />
<br />
Ron had not looked much at what was in the box until now, finally rifling through its contents. Pushing away the packing material, he looked at the item he dreamed of owning. They were specially designed boxers and briefs called packers. The design had the common patterns a person would see on men’s undergarments—the difference being a small imprint in the front giving it the false impression of the wearer having a penis. With these, Ron could wear another item for his attire, well fit pants. He slipped on the NBFit boxers, noticing the material was different from the panties he would normally wear. It was somewhat strange feeling a more coarse cotton against his vulva compared to his softer panties.<br />
<br />
Ron went to the mirror inspecting himself. He walked around his room imitating confident strides like plenty of the men he would see going about their business. With the NBFit briefs on, he looked like a normal teenage guy. For the first time he looked like a teenage guy. The false dent in his pants made it look like he had a penis.<br />
<br />
While he was never ashamed of his pussy, as it was the only reproductive organ he knew, he never wanted people to know his secret because of his parents&#39; warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad said breakfast is re—&quot; Roger spoke as he came into the room. He saw his brother look at him. &quot;Got some packers, I see,” he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I figured it&#39;s time for a change in my fashion,” Ron explained. “These help me achieve that goal.” He gestured to the underwear. “Besides me, what guy has a flat crotch and is sporting tight pants?&quot; Roger was silent as he left Ron&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
After slipping on his jeans, Ron looked down at how they looked. It was like he’d had one his whole life. He felt a strange sense of pride at the modest package his zipper area filled. Putting on the rest of his clothes, Ron made his way to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Sizzling meat crackled in the pan as the boy’s dad, Trevor, hummed a tune making the final touches to their breakfast. Trevor wouldn’t be considered traditionally masculine with his soft features. Standing at 5’5”, he was on the shorter end, with almost no body hair to speak of and a softer voice. He was wearing leggings that showed off his admittedly large round bottom, giving him an almost pear-shaped body. Ron’s theory over the years had been that nature itself had partially made him a woman, having seen a more typical male frame in photos before he and his brother were born. The softness of Trevor had given him the affectionate parental name of “Dad”.<br />
<br />
“Mornin’ sexy, mornin’ boys.” A mountain of a man walked into the kitchen at the same time as the brothers. The big man came up to the smaller man and cupped Trevor’s ass and gave him a kiss. Ron and Roger looked away as their parents made out in front of them.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, stop! The boys are here and can see.” This only encouraged him as he squeezed harder and began kissing more intensely. This continued as the pair groped each other until the faint smell of whatever Trevor was cooking had the telltale aroma of burning. Trevor quickly turned his attention back to the stove. “Oh shoot!” He shouted, doing his best to redeem the burned meal. Dad shoved his lover from the stove. Kyle, reading the situation, left to sit at the table with his sons.<br />
<br />
Kyle was the opposite of Dad. Tall at 6’3”, he was muscular and hairy with a deep, booming voice. He had kept himself in shape and was more fit than most men his age. He was the alpha male and manly man of the household, qualities which had given him the parental title of Father or, sometimes, Pops.<br />
<br />
“So, boys, ready for another week of school?” Roger was still in his foul mood from both Ron and Kyle’s chastising, and he kept quiet. Ron spoke about upcoming events at school and other various activities.<br />
<br />
Ron felt a pit in his stomach as he most likely knew the answer to his upcoming question. “I was wondering if I could join tryouts for wrestling and football? Pops, I want to get big like you so I can ace it. You know like what you told me you did with your dad way back when.”<br />
<br />
Father was quiet, and Dad gave him a look, but Ron couldn’t make out their unspoken signals. Then Dad lifted an eyebrow and Father let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
//I knew it. Oh well, at least I tried.//<br />
<br />
“Your dad and I wanted you to experience high school, even with the risk of you being exposed. I would be contradicting myself if I denied you the same privileges as Roger. You have my blessing, and yes, I will help you get in shape.” Ron smiled ear to ear after hearing his father’s approval. <br />
<br />
“Before you start celebrating, young man… How exactly do you plan on hiding your…delicates? School makes kids take showers after training, you know,” he heard Dad say. Ron was prepared for this: he explained methods that he had been in the works of implementing. Like when he was first enrolled, Ron had scoured the internet on various forums on how to remain undetected while around other people. “...And I even bought special underwear trans guys buy. I never grew breasts, and didn’t get a curved waist. As far as the rest of my classmates know, except for one area, I’m just like any other guy my age.” Pops and Dad nodded in approval, but Ron could tell Pops was still worried.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After breakfast was served and eaten, the brothers got in Ron’s car and made their way to school. They sat in quiet while crawling through morning traffic.<br />
<br />
“Look… I’m sorry, bro.” Roger’s voice pierced the silence. “Deadnaming, pussy jokes, everything. It’s just… I’m still bitter with her cheating on me like that.” Ron nodded his head, empathizing with his brother&#39;s pain. “We’re brothers, and I shouldn’t have said the things I did. I know it’s already tough being…” Roger waved his hand, gesturing at his brother’s body. “...What and who you are.”<br />
<br />
“Apology accepted, little brother. Next time you get like that, just tell me instead of lashing out.” He thought back to Roger having the outburst initially. “While we’re making up... I’m sorry for walking around naked like that. Exposing yourself to family intentionally like that is… inappropriate.” Ron pulled into the school parking lot looking for an ideal place to place his car.<br />
<br />
“Yo Ron, mind if I borrow some gum? I wanna impress that cute girl in homeroom.” Before he even got permission, Roger looked in the glove compartment and found something else. Ron felt his face grow red as Roger asked, “What the heck is this?”, pulling out a vibrator. “Why am I the only one normal in our family of freaks? I almost want to take back everything I said.”<br />
<br />
Too embarrassed to think of a comeback, Ron tried to end the conversation as soon as possible. “The gum is in the console, sorry,” he explained, parking.. Roger slammed the door as he quickly walked to class.</p>
