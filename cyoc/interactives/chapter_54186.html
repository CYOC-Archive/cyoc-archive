<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi was in her room re-dressing.  She had intended to find a way to keep what she had received after the night.  She wanted to be a sexy, rubber girl, with inflating breasts.  The wings could go and while she liked the feet she wondered if it would be better to be more normal.  But looking at her body in the mirror she wondered how that could be now.<br />
<br />
She ran her hands over her body hearing the squeaks of latex on latex.  It was different and unusual; no one else could feel like this.  Her glossy skin gleamed in the glow from her desk lamp.  She ran her hands around her narrow waist and felt the large heft of her ballooned breasts.  Her fairy wings fluttered a little moving air around her body and down her bare ass.  She felt a giddy desire run around her body.  The focus of sex over the last few hours had kept her in a state of arousal.  Her hands felt down between her legs.  She found the tight rubber lips between her fingers; they were sensitive like the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
Cathy lay in the living room where the others had left her to recover.  Her whole body continued to be stimulated by the ultra-tight plastic of the card costume.  Even the tips of her fingers felt like they were being licked by an all encompassing lover.  She wondered when this curse was lifted if she could ever wear clothing again.<br />
<br />
If the curse could be lifted.  It had been lost to that guy.  Now Cathy was stuck in a playing-card guard costume that would not leaved her alone.  Her nipples, as large and erect as they had been for hours, were being pulled at and flicked by the clothing.<br />
<br />
Dean's penis was still slowly thrusting into her.  It was large and tight and it never stopped.  It might stop wiggling if Dean concentrated but he was in the kitchen.  Cathy clenched her tired abdominal muscles trying to stimulate the cock.  She hoped her feeble efforts were having the same effect on Dean.  She knew he could feel it.  She found it funny to think that at the moment, Dean was making-out with Jen in the kitchen while his dick was fucking her in the living room.  She wondered if he found the situation funny too, but she was too tired to really care.  Her thighs were being pleasingly touched where she like them to be.<br />
<br />
She could barely move from exhaustion but the restrictive nature of her costume made moving difficult anyway.  If they did not get the curse back she wondered if she would go mad.  It would be a good way to go she reasoned.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Cathy felt a warm, wet feeling on her under arm.  Craning her head around she found a small puff of fur tucked up into her arm pit.  Grey and striped she recognized the tiny kitten the family had adopted a month ago.  Titus was its name she remembered.  It must have been hiding with all the commotion.  Now it had come out to clean her costume in the only way a kitten knew how.  Its rough tongue found its way from her sensitive arm to her very sensitive breast.<br />
<br />
Cathy moaned in defeat.  Everything seemed to want to tease her.  She felt the urges rising once again, slowly.<br />
<br />
***************************<br />
<br />
Jen was in the kitchen with Dean as she tried to call the pizzeria once again.  Dean was kissing her every time she said the p-word and it was getting a little annoying.  The guy on the other end of the line was being un-helpful.<br />
<br />
Jen did not want to be in this tiny maid outfit.  She had tried to take off the gloves but found them firmly attached.  Her long, curly, blue hair kept getting in her face and every time she tossed it out of the way her breasts would bounce and bounce forever.  She had taken to always holding her breasts with one arm to do anything.  Her huge, pouting lips made talking difficult and she stumbled over her words.  It did not help that she sounded like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I know Mike delivered the pizzas to us,&quot; she had to stop for a kiss. &quot;What I want to know is where did he have to go after this stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean continued to touch her body and seemed ready to keep kissing her.  Jen wanted him to.  Her body seemed to scream at her to tease him and make him want to have sex with her.  But she knew her clothing was not coming off.  What was wrong with her?  The guy on the phone kept telling her that they do not give out other customer's information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I leave a message for, Mike? ... It's very important. ... Yes!  I'm his cousin and I need to get in touch with him right now. ...  No, I don't know his cell number my phone broke yesterday. ...  Great, I have a pen,&quot; Jen said then copied down the number the guy gave her.  The pen slipped between her shiny, gloved fingers, but she was able to get the number.<br />
<br />
Hanging up the phone she turned to hug Dean.  They kissed passionately and Jen started to grind her hips into his.  The petty-coats crushed around her but reformed perfectly when she stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;All, we have to do is call this Mike guy and have him give me the curse back.  We're good.&quot;  Jen was so happy she jumped a little then regretted it when her large breasts almost knocked her over.<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
<br />
Naomi returned to the living room.  Her breasts were once again their tiny handfuls she had started the day with.  She had been impressed how quickly they had deflated after climax but she felt better now.<br />
<br />
Her lower-half was covered in a pair of bright-pink shorts, latex of course.  The material of her shorts was so tight that she was sure everyone could see the outline of everything below.  She had found a long wig that she had worn for hallowe'en last year.  It was straight and blond and fell down around her back.  Naomi had fixed it to her head with the fairy crown and had placed some strands of hair down over her nipples.  The curse had turned the fine hair into fine rubber bands but it did not object to the covered nipples.  Naomi was confident she could go outside if needed and be respectable if not shocking to look at.<br />
<br />
Naomi passed a fitfully sleeping Cathy with the kitten licking her nipples.  As she watched she could see that Cathy was having wild dreams.  Naomi passed by trying to not disturb the cute scene.<br />
<br />
Naomi stepped into the kitchen to find Dean and Jen.  Jen was yelling into the phone in a cute and sexy way.  Dean was shirtless and was wearing a tight pair of jeans.  Naomi slide up beside him and drank in his well sculpted body.  Jen had obviously been playing around.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got the guy's number and Jen is calling him,&quot; Dean said.  He looked at Naomi's wig and smiled.  &quot;At least your curse is only for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi smiled feeling the rubber of her cheeks wrinkling.  &quot;But I am still all rubber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen slammed down the phone.  &quot;That jerk won't curse me back to normal unless we go and meet him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He want's to see all of us?&quot; Naomi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Just me, but I am not going alone.  Look what he did to me.  I think he wants me to sleep with him.&quot;  Jen's huge eyes watered a little.  Her large lip quivered just a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we should really go out like this?&quot;  Dean asked indicating his state of undress and Naomi's obvious nakedness.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to,&quot; Jen said almost crying.  &quot;I have to find that man and make him turn us back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do we have to go?&quot; Naomi asked shyly.  She felt a stirring of excitement about going out into public.  Something clicked and she felt her breasts become slightly lighter.  Oh-no, she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to meet him at the high-school parking lot,&quot; Jen said with trepidation.  &quot;Who's driving?&quot;</p>
