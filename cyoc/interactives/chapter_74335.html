<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You did manage to keep up with Kaylee as she lead you away from the fairy ring of mushrooms that had somehow changed you from a male human into a decidedly female fairy. Your emotions were at present all over the map. Flight was actually kinda fun and being able to defy gravity was nice, and you were overjoyed to know that Kaylee was alive. You were heartbroken when she had disappeared, likely after coming into contact with the same fairy ring herself. But, at the same time you weren't too keen on remaining a fairy. You were male and thought of yourself as male. Kaylee had said that would be impossible, which was a bit depressing, but for the moment you flew along with her, just being happy to be with her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't that bad, Ad... Ada,&quot; Kaylee said to you as you flew along, &quot;We'll be together, and I'll help you get used to it. You'll be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so,&quot; you answered, guessing that Kaylee sensed your unease with being female for the rest of your life.<br />
<br />
You looked over at Kaylee who gave you a reassuring smile. Just seeing that, made something tingle in your mind that screamed &quot;I love you.&quot; As the two of you flew along, your mind then caught on what Kaylee had called you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ada? My name is Adam,&quot; you spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam is a boy's name, and judging by the two fairly large breasts on your chest, and what you were lacking when I found you, you are most decidedly a girl,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;Ada is a German name that means noble or happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really feel happy,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will in time,&quot; Kaylee gave another reassuring smile again.<br />
<br />
The two of them flew along until they came to what appeared to be a massive oak tree that dwarfed all the other trees in the park. You followed her as she flew up to a point on the trunk of the tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;You live in a tree now?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;all the fairies do. If we lived out in the open, humans would find us, and I doubt they'd recognize that I WAS human. They'd treat us as some sort of science experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about your magic?&quot; you found yourself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have magic, you have magic, we all have magic, yes, but it isn't all powerful,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;Fairy rings, like the ones we'd mistakenly fallen asleep in are areas where fairy magic has been concentrated to a point well beyond the powers of even the strongest fairy. Individually, our magic just isn't strong enough to deter something as big as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
You then watched as Kaylee waived her and in front of the tree trunk, and you noticed soft pink particles of light go out and touch the trunk of the tree. Once it did so, there was a small passageway that opened up and allowed Kaylee to flutter in, with you following behind her. You entered to find that the tree had essentially been hollowed out. You felt a tinge of some sort of energy, you guessed it was magic, running through the air, and flying throughout the hollowed out tree were a great many fairies. All of them had brightly colored hair and dresses that looked like they were made of flower petals, just like Kaylee's and yours were. They went about their business in what looked like carrying food and other things into what looked like ornate apartments that were carved into the walls of the tree. It sort of reminded you of what you might see in some child's fantasy book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Ada,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;I can show you where I live later, right now we need to meet with the Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of it is to make sure you have no intentions of challenging her throne, part of it is to welcome you to her &quot;kingdom,&quot; and part of it is to assign a training schedule to help adapt to being a fairy,&quot; Kaylee explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't want to be anyone's Queen,&quot; you protested, &quot;If anything, I'd want us to be human again and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She likely already knows that,&quot; Kaylee said with a sigh, &quot;it's generally a formality. The real part is the training, which she'll likely assign to me since we already know each other and will be an &quot;item&quot; again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a nervous smile and hugged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ada, but we need to get going,&quot; Kaylee replied.<br />
<br />
Kaylee began flying up the hollow space in the tree and you followed close behind, trying to keep hold of her hand. That was fairly difficult as trying to dodge moving fairies was a bit harder then dodging tree branches that weren't moving. Eventually the two of you came up to the top of the hollowed out trunk of the tree and you looked to see an even more ornately carved structure then the others. It was huge and seemed to wrap around the inside of the trunk of the tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Queen's palace,&quot; Kaylee explained, &quot;Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then followed Kaylee to land on what was a small platform that lead up to a flight of steps. It made you feel nervous and small, as you'd never interacted with royalty before. You followed behind her as she entered and entered into what looked like a long hallway. It was lined with what looked like paintings of fairies, though they all looked a little bit different. You guessed they were previous queens or relatives of the present queen in some way.<br />
<br />
As you came into the end of the hallway, it opened up into a large chamber that looked like a throne room. It, like the the trunk of the tree was absolutely packed with fairies. Many were socializing among themselves, a few were dancing, and you could swear you saw two making out in a corner of the room. Kaylee, meanwhile pulled you through the crowd until you came before a tall throne that was raised above the rest of the room.  It was between two ornate mirrors that seemed to shimmer with light. Seated on the throne was a very regal looking fairy.<br />
<br />
Her hair was a bright red color, which matched the color of her dress. The dress looked like it was made out of flower petals too, but it was larger and more ornate, almost like it was something that Queen Victoria would have worn in the 1800s. The fairy's face was looking friendly yet serious with a gold crown/tiara sitting on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen Titania, I've collected the newly transformed fairy as you requested,&quot; Kaylee addressed with a short bow.<br />
<br />
The fairy queen didn't answer, but looked directly at you. Your knees began to shake uncontrollably as you feared being killed as some sort of trespasser.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may relax, my child,&quot; Queen Titania said to you, &quot;You are in no danger and you've joined us at a good time of the year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; you blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Full Moon Festival, when we fairies celebrate our connection with nature,&quot; Queen Titania explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean to, uhhh...&quot; you said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Queen Titania nodded, &quot;humans, since they stopped believing in us as anything but &quot;fairy tales&quot; don't know of the power of the fairy rings and thus don't notice them... though not that we really complain. They're not knowing about us keeps us safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee's told me that, Queen Titania,&quot; you answered, sounding just a little bit more confident.<br />
<br />
Queen Titania nodded, &quot;Yes, I know. Just as I know of your desire to be human again. That, I'm afraid is impossible... not without killing you anyway. Though you and Kaylee are not bond to that form. In time, when your magic is stronger, you might be able to take human form...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot; you gasped sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you would remain female, and the spell would only be an illusionary one to the humans,&quot; Queen Titania spoke, &quot;and it will wear off after a short period of time. You would have to recast the spell several times in the course of a single day, just to avoid revealing that you are a fairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts,&quot; you grumbled, &quot;I'd really wished there'd be a way to go back. Kaylee and I don't want to trouble you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Queen Titania answered, &quot;and if there was a way I could help you in that regard, I would... but sadly, I cannot.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, what is your name, my child?&quot; Queen Titania asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my name was Adam, but since that doesn't fit, Kaylee's renamed me Ada,&quot; you said to the queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ada... a very pretty name,&quot; Queen Titania spoke, &quot;I welcome you to my kingdom and wish you and Kaylee a great deal of happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, your majesty,&quot; Kaylee spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Kaylee, as one of my advisers on human behavior and human culture, I trust Ada's training in magic to you, for the moment,&quot; Queen Titania spoke, &quot;once she's adapted to things, she can then transfer to the same magic schools you attended when you joined us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, your majesty,&quot; Kaylee bowed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now go on and enjoy yourselves for tonight,&quot; Queen Titania said to the both of you with an almost motherly smile.</p>
