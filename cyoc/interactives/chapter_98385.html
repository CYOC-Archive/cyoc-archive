<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Very well&quot; said Jasmine. &quot;We just have to tear the place apart, brick by brick. If there&#39;s no city he can&#39;t go into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Kyriel blinked in horror at the thought of the destruction Jasmine&#39;s plan would cause. &quot;But, but. . .&quot; she discovered that her new childlike nature made it harder to stand up to the &quot;adult&quot; angels, Jasmine in particular.<br />
<br />
 &quot;We can&#39;t just chase him in there. A kitsune in a web of kitsune magic could evade us for weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;No.&quot; A flat monosyllable from Tommy. <br />
<br />
 All heads turned to the male kitsune. Tommy continued. &quot;This is my responsibility. This is my city. No one is going to destroy it. Not Tamthis, not you. I&#39;ll chase him in there myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
___________________<br />
<br />
 It seemed that the city itself was addressing Keiko and Akane. &quot;Go back to Japan, or feel my wrath, little kitsune!&quot;<br />
<br />
 The Japanese kitsune exchanged worried glances. Then they both smiled. &quot;Ooh, feel his wrath&quot; Keiko chuckled. <br />
<br />
 &quot;He doesn&#39;t really have much of the kitsune spirit.&quot; Akane replied as both of them were busy unweaving Tamthis&#39;s city.<br />
<br />
 Suddenly the two kitsune felt a surge of power coming through the city, heading at them like a bolt of lightning. Crude, just hurling power at people was hardly the way of the trickster.<br />
<br />
 Rather than standing up to the bolt of raw magical power, the two kitsune altered themselves to absorb it, then used the power to carry themselves into the web of power Karther had woven. They were now in the same environment as Tamthis himself.<br />
<br />
 It&#39;s a good thing the kitsune are immortal, because they have a very poor sense of self-preservation.<br />
<br />
___________________<br />
<br />
 Alexandra had less to worry about than she thought. She was safe from Tamthis&#39;s direct wrath as long as she carried Kathy, because the directive to protect Tamthis&#39;s consort was still operating in his mind.<br />
<br />
 But Tamthis was not fully aware of his actions, and Alexandra found herself dodging building shards and displaced pottery as she made her way to the open courtyard and gardens of the palace, which she hoped would be a place of safety.<br />
<br />
 Another problem was that Kathy seemed to be regaining consciousness, and Alexandra had a feeling she wasn&#39;t going to be overwhelmingly grateful to her rescuer.<br />
<br />
____________________<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Jasmine was incredulous. &quot;You just regained self-identity. You think you can take on that thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
All eyes look upon Tommy , waiting to see how he would respond to the question. Kyriel was epically concern about Tommy state of mind and condition; he was already weak just from coming back and in truth he doesn&#39;t have any kind of powers that could match or  even surpass Tamthis power.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you beat something like that when it took an whole army just to fight equal to that monster strength. More importantly, how can we even be certain that there isn&#39;t any part or remains of Tamthis still lurking within you.&quot; More of the angels were as much concern about the fact as well as Jasmine has pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now wait a minute, we shouldn&#39;t be placing any doubts or anger toward Tommy.&quot; Lisa walk in front of Tommy, along with Erica and Kyriel to defend Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was just a victim just like anyone here. We can&#39;t start fighting against each andinstead work together on how to stop Tamthis, else we have no choice but to destroy the city&quot; <br />
<br />
 Tommy knew that he had been trap within in his own mind, a prisoner inside a hellish nightmare realm and just came out of it. It also true that he pretty much has no experience in fighting or even understand the situation he in. However, he can recall the memories of the time when he was Tamthis; the horrors and evil that he had done and the lives that were lost in the process. He couldn&#39;t just stand there and let the evil version of himself just do as he please, the nightmare has to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that there is some doubt about me, even I doubt myself. I was once your greatest enemy and now that here I am, weak and tired. But, if I can get close to Tamthis, I can take out  that fragment and absorb it to my body, then I can have a chance on even fight him.&quot; The angels were surprise by his speech, but Jasmine notice something weird about the last sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean &quot;that fragment&quot;? Jasmine question caught the ears of the angels and all look back at Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean the Queen Tammia persona.&quot; When they heard the awnser, all where just shock at how he had come to such an conclusion, even Kyriel the most. Jasmine nearly flip out and yell at Tommy with anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, you can be serious!? Queen Tammia, the persona that had the fused souls of Tammie and Janice, was the one that had cause all this to happen. She is far too dangerous and can&#39;t be even trusted, what worse is that you will be the one being absorb by her and than we be facing two threats.&quot; Kyriel walk closer to Tommey with a concern look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, this isn&#39;t the answer. We work so hard to bring you back, please don&#39;t throw away the life you have just got back.&quot; Tommy slowly place his hand on Kyriel shoulder as she look into his eyes; there was fear about his identity issue, but there was also a fire of resolve burning within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think that I rather have another way to fight Tamthis than even sacrifice both my humanity and manhood once again? Within my mind realm, the only person who was close to being a match to the Tamthis persona was the Queen Tammia persona. She is by far close to being able to do more harm on him alone, but by absorbing her into me, there is a chance That ic an be even more powerful than even Tamthis. But just like you said, there is a chance that I will be the one consume by my female self instead and should it happen, place just end me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel look back at the angel, seeing how they would respond to his answer, waiting to see if anyone was willing to take Tommy plan seriously or not.</p>
