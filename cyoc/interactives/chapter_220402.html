<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel wasn&#39;t really sure how long she&#39;d been out. <br />
<br />
But one thing was certain - when she did come to, and realized that her situation hadn&#39;t changed, she almost wished she hadn&#39;t woken up at all. She&#39;d never once before had any kind of thoughts resembling that. But her situation - it was so bizarre, so...inhumane...that she couldn&#39;t help but feel such thoughts now. <br />
<br />
For one, she still felt that constant sense of hollowness, like she was missing something - like a part of her new form ached to be sat upon. She did her best to ignore the feeling, but it was like trying to ignore your stomach when you were hungry - try as you might and that nagging sensation was always there. The idea of Keira coming back in and sitting on her made her shoulders shiver with barely repressed delight. <br />
<br />
For another, there was the simple fact that her body had become her prison - at least from the shoulders down. Anytime she looked down it was a stark reminder that she&#39;d been twisted and changed into that of a chair - yet, glancing down, you could see see the vestiges of her original form, twisted though it was into this new shape. Looking down and seeing the fluffy pillows her breasts had become was just one of the many awful reminders. <br />
<br />
And finally, there was the fact that she still had no mouth. <br />
<br />
When she&#39;d come to, she&#39;d tried to scream for help again, only to be given the reminder that it was no longer something she could do.<br />
<br />
Still, she&#39;d tried to free herself, trying to get any part of her body below her shoulders to move, yanking her head back and forth and grunting from exertion. <br />
<br />
The worst of it was the other girls in the room - the other girls turned furniture. And she&#39;d come to realize that most of the furniture in the room had once been human. And that probably meant most of the furniture in the house had once been human. She wasn&#39;t sure how sick in the head someone had to be to want human beings to use as furniture. <br />
<br />
Most of the furniture gave her sympathetic and understanding looks. It was sweet, in a way - but it was also just really depressing once she thought about it. The fact that they were giving her those looks...like they understood her mindset...god. That meant...that they&#39;d been in her position already and had come to realize it was hopeless? <br />
<br />
No. Rachel couldn&#39;t accept that. <br />
<br />
She wouldn&#39;t accept that!<br />
<br />
But time went by, and Rachel simply...sat there. Sitting was all she could do, after all. She was just another piece of furniture in the room. <br />
<br />
A few of the girls in the room had conversations with one another, but Rachel barely paid attention to any of it. It was simply background noise. Nothing that concerned her at the moment. <br />
<br />
How could any of this be real??? A fucking chair?!?<br />
<br />
Rachel renewed her struggles, her hair whipping around her head as she tried to break free again.<br />
<br />
But it was utterly pointless - her body simply did not budge below her shoulders - and eventually, she had to give up, her head dripping with sweat from the exertion. More tears fell when she saw her previous ones dotting her skin-turned-fabric below. The fact that she could feel it...<br />
<br />
And then she simply just...stared down at the floor. She could feel her heart beating in her chest - and briefly she wondered what the hell kind of biology she even had anymore. Were her organs even still there anymore? Had they been moved about? Or, was it just...the internal bits of a chair down there? Wood and stuffing and whatever the fuck else chairs were made of.<br />
<br />
Probably best not to think about it.<br />
<br />
And so she stared. <br />
<br />
And cried.<br />
<br />
And stared some more.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
Time passed.<br />
<br />
How much time had passed since she&#39;d arrived...wherever the hell here was. Her mom had to be up by now. Maybe she&#39;d be curious about where Rachel had gone. Maybe not. Rachel didn&#39;t always leave a note. She supposed her Mom would start to get worried when Rachel didn&#39;t turn up that night. She&#39;d probably call the police. And they would search. But probably not here - if here was even anywhere near there. But even if it was - who the fuck would think, oh, let&#39;s inspect the furniture in town. <br />
<br />
Footsteps echoed from the kitchen and Rachel&#39;s head snapped up, her eyes widening in a mix of fear and anticipation.<br />
<br />
<i>Sit on me!</i> Rachel found herself thinking, immediately feeling a wash of horror flow through her as she realized what she&#39;d thought. <br />
<br />
Keira walked in, eyes roaming the room before they came to a rest on Rachel. Her mouth turned up into a satisfied smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well hello there again, cutie,&quot; she drawled, coming closer. &quot;And how are you doing, hmm? Would you like your mouth back now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blinked rapidly, tears coming to her eyes. She hated herself as she nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? Are you going to be behave? No more outbursts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel shook her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...alright then,&quot; Keira said. <br />
<br />
Without preamble, she rested a knee on Rachel&#39;s lap - her seat - causing Rachel to let out a muffled gasp as a white hot sensation of pure pleasure thudded through her. Laughing lightly, Keira reached down and began to finger at Rachel&#39;s fabric-covered pussy. Rachel felt her body jerking in response, tingling sensations of pleasure bursting through her inanimate form; she could feel her silky pussy clenching around Keira&#39;s finger, and she tried to scream her bliss, but was unable. Smiling, Keira leaned forward and grabbed the back of Rachel&#39;s head with her other hand, and drew her forward into a kiss. <br />
<br />
There was a tingling sensation that flowed through her body, and then Keira leaned back, removing her fingers from her pulsing clit and then her knee from her seat of Rachel&#39;s now body.<br />
<br />
With shuddering, gasping breaths, Rachel realized her mouth had been restored to her. &quot;A...ahuh...&quot; she said, trying to form words. &quot;O...oh...oh god...nnngh....&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at Keira, who watched her imperiously, a single eyebrow raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...y-you...that...nnnngh. I...t...thank you,&quot; Rachel muttered, absolutely despising herself but equally hating the thought of her mouth being sealed up like that again.<br />
<br />
Keira smiled. &quot;Good girl,&quot; she complimented Rachel, stroking her cheek softly. Rachel closed her eyes, letting out a few more gasping breaths. Her mouth felt cottony, but at least it existed again. <br />
<br />
And then Keira turned and swept from the room without a backwards glance.<br />
<br />
Leaving Rachel behind once more, still with that awful aching feeling.<br />
<br />
The room was awkwardly silent in Keira&#39;s wake, save for the sound of Rachel&#39;s tears. She just wanted to go home. She wanted to see her Mom, she wanted to be in her own room, she wanted to be able to do something as simple as scratch her nose. She wanted to see her sister. Her dad. Her friends. None of them would have any idea of what had happened to her - for how could any of them ever imagine such a fate as this? <br />
<br />
&quot;God, get over it already!&quot; the girl-turned-birdcage grumbled suddenly. <br />
<br />
Rachel looked up, blinking away tears.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s head, shoulders, and breasts were normal - mostly - save for the fact that her skin was a shiny gold even there. The rest of her body had been twisted and bent into the shape of a birdcage, where a small bird was hopping around inside. Rachel looked at the bird, but as far as she could tell, it was simply just that - a bird. <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure if she was relieved about that or not. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; said the table - what had her name been? Penny, that was it. &quot;Don&#39;t be like that, we&#39;ve all been there!&quot;<br />
<br />
The birdcage-girl snorted. &quot;Boo hoo,&quot; she said in a snide voice. &quot;The quicker she gets used to it, the better it&#39;ll be. God, I hate new arrivals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were new once!&quot; Penny snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; said one of the girls who made up the sectional sofa. Right - Candy. That was her name. Steph and Tiffany were the other parts. &quot;Cut her some slack! It&#39;s not exactly something easy to get used to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name, sweetie?&quot; Penny asked, turning her head to look at Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares?&quot; the birdcage-girl snapped. &quot;Who cares what any of our names are?? I&#39;ve been here long enough that I know it doesn&#39;t fucking matter! Look at us! We&#39;re never getting out of here. My name might as well be fucking Birdcage! That&#39;s all I am now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, get over yourself!&quot; Steph grumbled. <br />
<br />
Rachel looked up at - well, at Birdcage, then back at Penny, who nodded at her encouragingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;M...my name is Rachel,&quot; she said in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a pretty name,&quot; Steph said with a sigh. &quot;I dated a Rachel once. She was sweet. Anyway. It&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other pieces of furniture likewise greeted her, save for Birdcage, who simply rolled her eyes and rotated away. Even the little Bonsai tree girl seemed to nod, causing the leaves to rustle a bit. If the situation hadn&#39;t been so surreal and horrifying, it might&#39;ve been cute.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked around, trying to keep her breathing under control in the face of all these girls turned furniture. <br />
<br />
She looked at Penny first. &quot;H...how long?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
Penny looked at her sadly, and let out a small sigh. &quot;A few years for me, I think...?&quot; She shrugged her shoulders as best as her wooden and glass body could. &quot;One day, I was a college junior...the next...I got a weird package...I was sucked into it...and then...I was here. Nothing more than a table. Useful for holding flower vases, magazines, TV remotes, drinks, and not much else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blinked back tears, and then looked over at the sectional sofa girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Longer,&quot; Tiffany muttered, not meeting her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;About...ten years I think?&quot; Steph said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Candy agreed. &quot;It&#39;s a little hard to know, exactly...but...about that. The three of us, we were roommates, in our last year of college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten years?&quot; Rachel asked, feeling her heart pick up speed. &quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy nodded slightly. &quot;Yeah. I know. Believe me. I know. It&#39;s...well, like Penny said. It is what it is. There&#39;s some perks, I guess? We haven&#39;t really, y&#39;know, aged. I guess it makes sense. Won&#39;t have to worry about wrinkling or going grey anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, what a fuckin&#39; perk that is,&quot; Birdcage growled. &quot;No aging means we won&#39;t even be able to grow old and die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore that one,&quot; Penny said firmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Ava, in case you forgot,&quot; the TV said. The girl&#39;s head was nestled at the top of the TV. For a moment, she thought the girl was wearing a headband - but no. It was simply...two metal antenna, sticking out from the top of her head. &quot;And yeah...it&#39;s...I&#39;ve been here for less time than these, but still long enough to have...gotten used to it, I guess? At a certain point, there&#39;s just not much you can do about it. And so...&quot; Ava sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel felt more tears falling down her cheeks; tears she was unable to wipe away. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Ten years...that&#39;s....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some perks!&quot; Penny said. &quot;It&#39;s not - look, I won&#39;t pretend it&#39;s a good thing or that it&#39;s right or anything like that. But...being used? It...it feels good. And for whatever else she is, Keira...she...she does try to use us. All of us. For...what we&#39;re intended for and...other things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She means fucking us,&quot; Birdcage added helpfully. <br />
<br />
Penny rolled her eyes, and blushed slightly. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it like that,&quot; she snapped. &quot;But...yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite the sight, let me tell you, seeing furniture get fucked,&quot; Birdcage went on. &quot;Penny, you&#39;re my favorite - I&#39;ve heard of people getting fucked on tables, but never AS one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; snapped a new voice. Rachel looked over, curious, and then her eyes settled on a lamp. She could make out the girl&#39;s head sticking above the lampshade - her mouth fell open as she realized the girl&#39;s breasts were the lights. &quot;God! You&#39;re such a bitch!&quot; The lamp looked over at Rachel. &quot;Hey...&quot; she said in a softer tone. &quot;I&#39;m Megan. Been here...longer than sofa girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have names you know,&quot; Steph grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, sofa girls is easier to say,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Anyway. It&#39;s...I don&#39;t know. At least we have each other to talk to. We&#39;re not alone in this. Small comfort, I guess, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded, looking away. &quot;I...I just graduated high school,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I was making myself some breakfast, and heard a package get delivered. I got sucked in to it...put in some kind of crate...and n-now I&#39;m here.&quot; The others nodded sympathetically, save for Birdcage. &quot;I guess...I don&#39;t know, I guess my Mom won&#39;t really know where I went or what happened to me. She&#39;ll...she&#39;ll probably never know, will she? Fuck. Fuck! I don&#39;t even know where I am! Where are we anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not really sure,&quot; Penny admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re...entirely on Earth? Not like another planet!&quot; she said quickly, as Rachel&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;I don&#39;t mean like aliens or anything. I just think...I don&#39;t think we&#39;re somewhere we know of. Like...this place is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very different,&quot; Steph agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a different time period or some kind of hidden world,&quot; Megan put in. &quot;I&#39;ve seen some weird stuff. Keira&#39;s had people over. Guests that weren&#39;t quite human. Witches. Centaurs. Even some mermaids. A gargoyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that weird guy. The one that dropped you off - that dropped most of us. He hasn&#39;t aged at all. You&#39;ll see him around - usually whenever he...drops off a new arrival,&quot; Candy said.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked around at the various girls. &quot;How many?&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot,&quot; Penny said in a flat tone. &quot;A lot...most of the furniture in the house. The kitchen, the bedroom, various guest rooms, the dining room...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bathroom,&quot; Megan whispered. <br />
<br />
Rachel felt lightheaded for a moment, and worried that she might pass out again. She managed to get herself under control. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s also the deck furniture, some pool toys, and I think a few trees as well,&quot; Steph said. <br />
<br />
&quot;And her sex toys,&quot; Birdcage said. &quot;Don&#39;t forget those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could,&quot; Megan muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;S-sex toys?&quot; Rachel asked, choking out the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Birdcage said. &quot;A vibrator. She&#39;s quite the party buzz.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus,&quot; Tiffany said, though it was followed by a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;T...this can&#39;t be real,&quot; Rachel whispered. &quot;You&#39;re telling me...that...everything in this house, they used to be human...&quot; Rachel felt the room begin to spin slightly. &quot;Even like, her bed. Her bed? Her toilet? Her shower??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ava said. &quot;Pretty much.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Rachel gasped. More tears began to fall. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
The footrest looked over at her. &quot;She crazy, obviously,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m Fi, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacy!&quot; cried a voice. Rachel looked up at the wall and saw a painting of a beautiful woman - except it&#39;s face stuck out slightly from the painting and moved slightly. &quot;Hey down there,&quot; it said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hailee!&quot; shouted a voice from above. The ceiling fan - a girl who&#39;s head hung from the center, her breasts the lamps, and her legs and arms twisted into the blades of the fan. &quot;Sorry about shouting, we&#39;re kinda harder to talk to cause we&#39;re up so high! But it&#39;s nice to meet you!&quot;<br />
<br />
One by one, the various bits of furniture introduced themselves. The end tables, the phone, the tree (a girl named Jade), the remote - every single bit of furniture in the room, including the rugs and the drapes and the doors to the various rooms - had all once upon a time, been living humans. <br />
<br />
And Rachel was grateful that she wasn&#39;t alone in this. <br />
<br />
But the sheer number of them - the amount of time they&#39;d been there -<br />
<br />
Well. Maybe they&#39;d given up. But Rachel wouldn&#39;t. She was going to find a way out of this. One way or another, she&#39;d...she&#39;d find a way. She wasn&#39;t sure how yet. But no situation was impossible. There had - HAD - to be a way out of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you all,&quot; Rachel said through numb lips. <br />
<br />
Footsteps echoed from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Keira appeared in the doorway. &quot;Well. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve all gotten to know each other,&quot; she said. And to her credit, it didn&#39;t sound sarcastic. Not that it made it any better. Rachel looked at her, a mix of longing, fear, and anger swirling within her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lay down on us!&quot; Candy cried. Her voice sounded entirely different. &quot;C&#39;mon, hang out for a bit!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me on!&quot; Megan said. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can watch some shows!&quot; Ava put in. &quot;I&#39;m sure I have something good on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m always ready to help take a burden off!&quot; Fi shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;S...sit on me!&quot; Rachel found herself saying. <br />
<br />
Keira looked over at her and gave a slow, sensual smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; she asked, walking over to Rachel.<br />
<br />
Rachel closed her eyes, hating the need she felt, the want, the desire. She felt so hollow, so cold. And she knew if Keira sat on her...she knew it would feel wonderful. And she hated it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Keira grabbed the remote - Alicia - and then turned on Megan the lamp, dragged her hand across the seats of the couch girls, licked the glass surface of Penny the table, turned on Megan the TV, tapped the branches of Jade the bonsai tree, spun Birdcage, and settled into Rachel the chair.<br />
<br />
Pure, utter bliss spread through her. Pleasure mixed with warmth, and Rachel allowed herself to get lost in the sensations as Keira nestled back into her chair body, resting against her pillowy breasts. Constant waves of orgasmic delight washed through Rachel&#39;s body, making her gasp and moan from the roiling sensations. So long as Keira sat on her, the sensations kept up - and she felt a sense of completeness. <br />
<br />
And throughout it all, she kept a thought in her head - she was going to find a way out of this.<br />
<br />
Somehow.<br />
<br />
Someday. <br />
<br />
She would find a way.</p>
