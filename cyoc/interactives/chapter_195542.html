<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You take a deep breath (or rather, Zoe does, though that hardly matters, as breathing is typically involuntary, anyway), and once again catch a whiff of your earlier sexual experience.  Zoe looks down on the floor, leaving you staring at a dried mess.  &quot;Oh, gosh, that.  Sorry about that!  I&#39;m really not sure what happened.  Something about the transformation... I dunno.&quot;  She smirks.  &quot;Although, I did like that one point during the initial transformation.&quot;  She licks around your muzzle, and you mentally shudder when you realize that this was the mouth that she used to... yeah, best not think about that.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you find yourself walking out of Zoe&#39;s bedroom -- on your toes, no less, with your new tail swaying behind you.  Not really knowing where you&#39;re going, you find yourself walking into the kitchen, opening under the sink for some cleaning supplies.  Trying to grab them, though, proves difficult for your less dextrous handpaws.  Zoe sighs, and holds them into your arms, pressing the supplies lightly into your breasts.  The sensation, while new and somewhat distracting for you, doesn&#39;t seem to affect Zoe, any.<br />
<br />
Carrying the supplies back into her room, she gets down on your knees and drops them on the floor.  Grabbing the spray bottle, it takes a bit of finangling, but she manages to spray down the sexual stain (it&#39;s at this point that you realize that, unlike you, Zoe is right-handed).  The scent of the soapy substance is strong, and you wonder if your fox nose is more sensitive to the stuff.  Zoe then begins scrubbing away.  You would be glad you didn&#39;t have to do the cleanup duty, if it didn&#39;t feel like you were doing the work, yourself.  But this body, foreign as it is, feels very much like yours, even down to the muscles doing the work.  It makes it hard to think of these furry arms as anybody&#39;s but yours.  You would look at them and admire them in action, if Zoe didn&#39;t have your eyes focused on the task at hand.  Yes, even Zoe&#39;s blue eyes seem like your own.<br />
<br />
The task complete, she clumsily returns the cleaning supplies back to the kitchen sink.  &quot;Not gonna lie, as neat as this is, I will be glad to have proper hands, again.&quot;  She giggles at her own comment.  Given how surreal the situation is, you didn&#39;t find the comment worth a chuckle, and the forced giggle only adds to the surrealism.<br />
<br />
Zoe looks down towards your crotch, which to you only brings attention to the fact you no longer have a dick dangling down there.  She brushes the fur around your crotch and thighs.  &quot;I guess I should clean us up, too, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She starts making her way to the bathroom, and you only now realize how you&#39;ve effectively been walking around your girlfriend&#39;s house, completely naked, in the body of your foxified girlfriend.  And you&#39;re about to be in the shower with her.  In her body.  Suddenly, she stops and puts her hands on her sides.  &quot;Hey, now, what&#39;s going on?  Are you getting aroused?  Stop that.  I WILL take a cold shower if you don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, she squeals in shock as the cold water rushes down your fur.<br />
<br />
The feeling was mutual, though, and with your hormones now in check, the shower proceeds as planned.  Though you are covered in fur from head to toe, she only focuses on washing around your crotch and thighs.  The unusual feeling of wet fur is second to the strangeness of having a slit in your crotch washed, when normally your crotch comes with accessories.  But even that is second to the hot water that now flows through your fur, instead.  It&#39;s not unbearable, but it&#39;s clear that your girlfriend likes her showers more hot than you do.  And you can tell that she&#39;s aware of your slight discomfort.  But you are a guest in HER body, and she&#39;s going to keep the water right where she likes it.<br />
<br />
Two towels later, she gives up before using a third towel, and begins drying your fur with the hair dryer.  THIS, on the other hand, feels Heavenly.  Honestly, you almost wouldn&#39;t mind always living with fur, if this were a silver lining.  But, you don&#39;t want to wish for that until you know all the drawbacks.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s when Zoe lifts your tail (using its own muscles) and starts drying beneath it that you find yourself wishing you could examine this body more.  You know this is technically Zoe&#39;s body, and she wouldn&#39;t want you feeling all over her body under normal circumstances.  But given the current circumstances, privacy is thrown out the window.  Thankfully, she senses your curiosity.  &quot;Now we&#39;re talking.  Glad you&#39;re seeing things my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sets down the air dryer and makes her way to her room, heading straight to the mirror.  You have no way of asking specifically what you want to examine, but she herself seems interested in giving just about her whole body an examination.  After all, before now, all her experiences with this body were quickly interrupted as she hollowed and lost conciousness as an animal costume.<br />
<br />
She first focuses on her face, first turning your head back and forth to overve the length of your muzzle, not too long and not too wide.  You yourself had already made this observation when you were examinging Zoe&#39;s lifeless mask, though it&#39;s much more impressive when not made out of plastic, not to mention sticking out between your own eyes.  It even now sports a set of whiskers, which she briefly plays with.  She then opens your mouth, wider than any human could, and sticks your tongue out.  She eyes the carnivorous teeth within your maw, making you wonder if you&#39;re able to eat raw meat in this form.  She closes your muzzle, and uses that long tongue to lick your own nose -- an act that surprises you, given that you can&#39;t do that as a human.<br />
<br />
Looking up towards your ears, she starts to swivel and move them.  To you, this is an impressive feat, as you never figured out how to wiggle your ears as a human.  She suddenly looks smug, sensing your mental compliment.  From here, she makes a variety of silly expressions -- happy, sad, shocked -- each one involving different positions of her ears.  Suddenly, your ears flatten back, and you find yourself greeted with bared fangs and a growl.  You are mentally startled, which Zoe quite easily senses, and starts laughing.  It&#39;s at this point that you would try to play it off and act cool, if you had some way to verbally communicate with Zoe.<br />
<br />
Zoe calms down from laughter and looks again at the top of your head, and frouns a little.  Turning to the side, she brings a handpaw to the top of your head, and rubs down its back.  You can sense her disappointment, likely at no longer having long hair.  Looking only at her head, you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell she was female at a glance.  Looking down at her breasts, on the other hand...<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s an area you would like to examine.  You have breasts now.  You want to grab them, feel their weight.  Unfortunately, Zoe ignores your breasts, and instead observes the three pairs of nipples below them.  She gives them a light rub.  Besides causing a light tingly feeling, you find that your extra nipples are, in fact, just like any regular nipples.  In fact, you note with irony that you&#39;re probably more used to these nipples than your girlfriend, as these are not on top of breasts.  &quot;I wonder, if we had kits, would we have one or eight?&quot;  And there went that train of thought.  The last thing you want to think about right now is getting PREGNANT in this body.<br />
<br />
Zoe turns to her side, eyeing how your tail hangs over your butt.  You&#39;ve clearly inherited Zoe&#39;s butt, as it has a bit of roundness compared to your own butt.  You watch and feel as Zoe sways your fluffy tail around and up and down.  You&#39;re glad to find Zoe grabbing your tail at its base, feeling how it connects to the bottom of your back -- a natural extension of your spine that nearly reaches down to the floor.  She curls your tail to your belly, and hugs it.  The fur on your tail is thick and soft.  It&#39;s pretty nice, but Zoe seems to like it even more than you, as she seems to hug it for several minutes.  You can sense a feeling of comfort emanating from her emotions.<br />
<br />
Still holding your tail in your left arm, Zoe raises your right handpaw in front of your face, observing it.  As noted before, the claw-tipped digits are thick, lacking the dexterity of a human hand.  And though you have thumbs, they do not seem to be as opposable.<br />
<br />
Letting your tail loose, she places your handpaw on the mirror, leaning on it for stability, as she lifts one of your feet.  (Seems she completely skipped over what now lies between your legs, though you&#39;ve already had enough &quot;experimenting&quot; with that for today.)  She experimentally curls the toes, and then notices how each foot has a dew claw up near the heel of the feet.  She puts your foot back down, bouncing a little, experimenting with how you now stand on your toes.  Despite previously being plantigrade, standing digitigrade with these feet feels perfectly natural.  She then sits down, tail curling around your side, and brings a foot up close for a look.  It is here you realize that these feet are longer than your human feet.  No way you&#39;re fitting any shoes on these.  Though if regular foxes can go everywhere barefoot, so can you.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so strange.  I&#39;ve been transforming into this for years.  And now it feels like I&#39;m experiencing it for the first time.&quot;  She looks back toward the mirror and smiles.  &quot;Thank you for wearing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The happiness you feel from your girlfriend makes this all worth it.</p>
