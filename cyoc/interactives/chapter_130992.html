<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the taxi was underway Marlene commented &quot;Rod seems a nice young man. He sounded a bit unhappy that he is not coming with you tonight&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he wanted to&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack&#39;s policy is a bit last century isn&#39;t it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. What do you mean by Jack&#39;s policy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never new Jack did you? He was Alan&#39;s father. Started the company in the early 80&#39;s. It was his idea that work functions should be for staff only. His only exception was for the Christmas party each year&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been with Penberthy&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too long it sometimes feels&quot; We sat in silence for a while &quot;I started here when I was a young thing like you. 32 years ago now. I was Jack&#39;s secretary. Didn&#39;t know a thing when I started. Only how to look pretty&quot; She giggled. &quot;Myself and Gerard practically run the show now. Alan has little interest in the cars, he would much rather be out on the water. Did you know he was studying to be a marine biologist, was at university? Jack was never happy about that, said he was going to take over the company some day and needed to learn the ropes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long has Alan been the boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack had his first heart attack 3 years ago. Alan had to quit his study and move back home. When a second heart attack took Jack from us, Alan became the principle. That was probably about 6 months before you started&quot; The taxi pulled up outside the function center, I got out while Marlene paid the fare. <br />
<br />
Once Marlene joined me I had my 1st real glimpse of the red ankle length dress she was wearing. I guessed she was in her early 50&#39;s but was still a very attractive woman. Unlike me she wore sensible but elegant shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marlene, Sarah. Over here&quot; I looked up to see Helen and Gerard on the stairs &quot;You two look magnificent. I love your hair Sarah&quot;<br />
I negotiated the stairs in my heels and joined them at the top. Helen gave me a hug, she was looking good herself in a lacy black maternity dress. <br />
Gerard was in a dinner suit and greeted us each with a hand kiss &quot;Ladies, may I escort you inside&quot;<br />
<br />
As we entered I said to Helen &quot;I didn&#39;t think you were coming&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill had to pull out so I got a late call up, Luckily I had this dress&quot;<br />
<br />
We were greeted inside the room by waiters with trays of champagne and beer. I took a champagne, having learnt Sarah&#39;s preference earlier in the week. The waiter said that cocktails and other drinks were available at a bar which he pointed out. Gerard who had taken a beer, excused himself from our company to fetch a mineral water for Helen.<br />
<br />
Helen spotted some unoccupied lounge chairs in a corner &quot;Let&#39;s move over to those seats. I won&#39;t last on my feet for long&quot;<br />
Marlene excused herself from us saying she had spotted an old friend that she had to say hello to. So we wobbled and waddled our way to the seats. Helen sat down and said &quot;Junior is very active tonight, I think he is going to be a footballer. Would you like to feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
I placed my hand where she indicated and could feel the baby pushing against her taut stomach. &quot;How long to go now&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 33 weeks. Into the home straight&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be a strange experience&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something every woman needs to go through. It&#39;s what our bodies are made for. Are you planning a big family with Rod?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t really spoken about to be honest&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel sorry for Marlene, Jack never wanted another child, he thought Alan was enough&quot; I must have looked surprised &quot;Didn&#39;t you know...... Jack divorced Alan&#39;s mother when he was a toddler. Marlene and Jack were together for 20 years, never married her though&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation changed course when Gerard approached with Marlene&#39;s drink. He handed it to her then said &quot;I think we will get a lot of sales from this show. The booth was busy all day. The bar idea was a good one, as many of the patrons came for a drink then once relaxed inspected the new cars&quot; he continued &quot;Even more popular was the posters of you and Karen. They had all gone by lunchtime. I ended up ordering an extra hundred that we will be able to pick up in the morning&quot; <br />
<br />
Just great I thought........... I&#39;m going to adorn every teenage boys bedroom wall. &quot;I&#39;m going to see what cocktails they have&quot; I got up to hide my embarrassment.<br />
<br />
As I neared the bar a waitress offered a plate of hors d&#39;œuvres, I took one and pointed her towards where Helen was. &quot;Sarah&quot; I heard. It was Alan who was with Steven. &quot;You look lovely. Where are you off to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to look at the cocktails&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll come with you. My shout tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank-you Alan&quot; We proceeded to the bar and I chose a &#39;White lady&#39; Alan and Steven each chose a &#39;Kamikazi&#39;. Once served I led the others back to Gerard and Helen. <br />
<br />
I got to chatting with Alan and learned he was also partner in a marine dealership. He also owned a 45 foot yacht and his eyes lit up with enthusiasm as he told me of an upcoming cruise along the coast he was planning.<br />
<br />
Marlene and Mitch also joined us with Mitch being very polite for a change. We enjoyed nibbles as wait staff circled the room and Alan offered to collect more cocktails. Marlene said &quot;Surprise me&quot; <br />
<br />
I said &quot;I&#39;ll have one of them as well&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan went to buy the drinks and asked Mitch to come and help carry. Some of the staff from the local Ford dealership joined us. Tony had previously worked at Penberthy&#39;s and he introduced us to his colleagues. One of them was Mary from the netball team, we got to chatting. Alan came back and handed me a drink saying it was a &#39;Malibu Paradise&#39; and I introduced him to Mary. When he moved on to mingle elsewhere, Mary asked &quot;Is he single?&quot; <br />
<br />
I replied &quot;Yes. And he is the boss&quot; She made eyes<br />
<br />
Shortly after a man went to a stage in the center of the room and introduced himself as Graham saying he would be MC for the evening. He told some lame jokes then introduced a magician &#39;Mr Illusio&#39; who would be the entertainment. <br />
<br />
Mr Illusio certainly wore the typical magician top hat and black coat and gave a 20 minute performance. He was actually very good and I found myself clapping eagerly after each trick. Graham eventually retook the stage and told everyone to grab something to eat and drink because in 5 minutes they would be announcing the award winners.<br />
<br />
Alan returned with another drink for me this time a yellow drink he called a &#39;Apple Pie Martini&#39; It tasted delicious. I wasn&#39;t listening to what Graham was saying up on stage so was caught by surprise when Alan said &quot;That&#39;s us&quot; grabbed my hand and said &quot;Come with me&quot;<br />
We walked up to the stage with the crowd clapping. We stopped under the spotlight and Graham shook Alan&#39;s hand, gave me a kiss and presented a trophy to Alan. We returned to where the rest of the Penberthy&#39;s crew were standing and I learned the award was for best booth at the show. <br />
<br />
Not long after Mr Illusio returned to the stage. He said &quot;For my next act I will need some volunteers. Where are that young couple who were up here receiving an award earlier?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch called out &quot;Over here&quot; and pointed at me and Alan.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s who I am looking for&quot; He beckoned us &quot;Would you mind returning to the stage&quot;<br />
<br />
We looked at each other. Neither of us could see a way out. I followed Alan back to the stage. Mr Illusio asked us our names and if we could stand either side of him. He the asked &quot;Alan can I borrow your wallet&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan assented and reached into his pocket &#39;It&#39;s not here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s alright&quot; Said Mr Illusio &quot;I have a spare one in here&quot; He doffed his hat and produced a wallet &quot;Actually I believe this might be yours&quot; and handed the wallet to Alan. &quot;Check it&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan did &quot;It&#39;s mine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your money intact&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well how did Sarah end up with $50 in her shoe&quot; This was news to me. He turned to me. &quot;Sarah will you please take off your right shoe&quot; I did and there was a $50 note in it&quot; Everyone clapped. &quot;I will have to punish you Sarah. Have a sleep until I think up a suitable punishment&quot; With that he waved his hands in front of me.<br />
<br />
Marlene later filled me in on what happened next. Evidently my punishment was that I would have to cluck like a chicken every time Mr Illusio said &#39;Rooster&#39;. Alan was punished as well, he was hypnotized to nod his head like a rooster every time I clucked. Evidently the room was in stitches as Mr Illusio told a story about visiting a farm. Eventually he said we had been punished enough and returned us to normal.<br />
<br />
Next thing I could remember Mr Illusio was looking me in the eye and asking &quot;How do you feel about roosters Sarah&quot; I must have looked at him blankly but eventually replied I didn&#39;t usually think about roosters. I wondered why the crowd clapped. Mr Illusio lastly said he would give us a parting gift for been such good sports. He clicked his fingers in front of my eyes and whispered something indecipherable into my ear. He did the same to Alan then announced we could return to our friends. The room clapped us as we did so.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night was a bit of a blur. Perhaps I had drunk a little to much. I can remember at one stage saying &quot;Thank you&quot; to Alan as he gave me yet another drink. I can remember it because I accompanied the thank-you with a kiss.<br />
<br />
Marlene was looking out for me and suggested that it was time she got me home. Alan accompanied us outside and helped us into a taxi. He thanked us for a lovely evening and gave us both a goodnight kiss.<br />
<br />
Marlene saw me back to Rod&#39;s. She asked the taxi to wait and took me to the door. Sarah was still up watching TV. Marlene suggested to him that I might need a bit of help to get to bed. That is the last thing I could remember until waking up in the morning with a horrid hangover.</p>
