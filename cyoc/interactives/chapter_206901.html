<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boy&#39;s adult mind was soon smothered by new thoughts as his new life as a jungle monkey baby dragged on and on. He did not know it but this species of giant apes matured extremely slowly. Plus, he would still look more like a giant human than an ape and humans grow up a lot slower than monkeys. He would spend his life as an adult Tarzan. Except his name would be a lot sillier. Not that the apes cared. Especially his new mommy. Because she was overjoyed to have a baby that that would take so long in becoming an adult. She could keep him close to her a lot longer! He would stay her baby for so much longer than usual! So much more days to kiss, tickle and hug him! And feed him delicious food! Speaking of which, thanks to the magic mush the former human had swallowed, his smell meant that as his adoptive mommy, she felt a tingle in her chest and nipples in particular. Soon she would give her adorable Giggles creamy milk that would make him even more of a baby. He&#39;d cut such a lovable picture! Yes, the villagers had been particularly generous to her with such a fine human to turn into a fine baby and in return, their crops and game would be extra-protected from giant insects and other awful creatures. In the meantime, the wide and extensive caves resonated with the laughter of their new addition. It was fun to have four hands so as to tickle that baby more so. Pebbles, the new mother, now had a collection of feathers and brushes to stop her baby crying and make him instantly happy. He was not only the sweetest baby, he was also fun toy. His soft bare skin was fun to tap and see bulge as Giggles was stuffed with food and drink. If he did not want to eat, tickling him into submission took no time. And maybe, if he continued being so reliant on her, she would just raise him as a girl. He would make a nice mate to a strong male because he had more fat than muscles, even for a baby, he did not seem to have many reflexes and he would grow slowly. But his chubby features and gurgles would make anyone think him cute. His genitals would probably stay small and a few bows would make him more than attractive. She would teach him to show his cheeks and lips just so and any male would bring him the most beautiful fruits and wait in line to groom him. Giggles could act coquettish and girlish. Some males did not like females more independent than they and preferred those that acted very girly and silly. Giggles could be that. After all, all the females gushed over him already.<br />
<br />
For his part, Giggles felt time was too slow and boring. He was molly-coddled and hated that he liked it. He could barely move around, let alone crawl. He was too often sluggish and tired. He was woken up giggling to being tickled and the stupid chimp appreciated her role way too much. Instinctively he learned his new name and hated with a passion. Inwardly, because his body had different ideas, like living up to his new idiotic name and answer with laughter, gurgles and joy in his eyes. When his feet were kissed, his belly felt the brush of a feather and his armpits tickled, he could sense the love and joy his mommy felt for him and he could not stop from sending back waves of pure delight and innocence. He wanted to spit back the purees he was forced to swallow but he felt like he should fill his tummy because his perfect mommy wanted that and he loved her attention and tickling game. He patted his belly expertly and filled him more if she felt his stomach could do with more food to keep him fat. Never mind that he felt bloated and that his little adult consciousness screamed! Worse, he had noticed her monkey boobs getting bigger and one day he understood with horror why. She approached him to her chest and he saw little drops of a white liquid pearl out of the nipples. His brain screamed in utter mortification but his baby face just expressed astonishment and curiosity. Pebbles stuffed a nipple in his mouth and he started suckling because she his mommy, he had to obey her and because as his baby, he had to do it now. Mommy rewarded him with pats and little grunts of love and approval. When he was done, she burped him happily and let him digest the odd creamy fluid. Her eyes filled with love made him wish to be the baby she wanted and unbeknownst to him, suckling her milk made him more receptive to her desires for him.<br />
<br />
With a diet of attention and milk, slowly but surely Giggles became attached to his mommy in more ways than one. He cried when she was gone, obeyed her to a tee and lost himself in his baby-mind as if he was under a sleepy hypnosis. He liked being changed into feathery diapers and lived to be babyfied by Pebbles. Tickling was the best sensation and peeing in a diaper was nothing embarrassing now. He loved being cooed at and would gurgle on command. Pebbles was happy that her adorable, best-behaved baby&#39;s penis and scrotum remained absolutely puny. That way he looked more like a girl and his staying near her and being so calm and shy were good signs. His fussiness was so easily quelled by a few tickles. He was so sweet to look at all the time, from sleeping in his cradle to being washed without a fuss to being cuddled and kissed all day long. He was shy and liked nothing more than hide next to her but that was exactly what she wanted. Giggles would make any male feel self-important. However, Giggles had a lot of time before even thinking about mating and Pebbles was happy showing off such an unusual but perfect baby. He never disappointed her, was never rambunctious, never acted out and stayed as pretty and calm as she wished. Even his fussiness had gone down dramatically and the other females even got a bit jealous that Pebbles had gotten such an obedient baby.</p>
