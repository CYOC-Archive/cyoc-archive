<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dawn licked her black cheetah lips as she pushed some buttons on the remote. Zack stood there, trying to be cool. He was scared of what Dawn had in mind for revenge...and, he was even more surprised to realize...he was excited to find out as well.<br />
<br />
After a bit, Dawn smiled. &quot;There. I think that&#39;s right.&quot; She held the remote toward Zack and activated it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please state creature,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheetah,&quot; Dawn said with a fang-y grin.<br />
<br />
Zack looked nervously down at his hands. He waited for a few seconds, but nothing seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I set it to five minutes. A little more time than you gave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for what?&quot; Zack asked, knowing there had to be more than just a simple cheetah transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;For me to pick out a book. Stay close.&quot; She scraped a claw underneath his chin, and he felt a tingle go up his spine. Suddenly he felt ... horny. It must be the cheetah instincts manifesting in his mind, he thought. Dawn a female cheetah and Zack, turning into a male cheetah. After a few more seconds he began to feel fur growing all over his skin. He was fascinated by the subtle feelings...a slow transformation allowed him the time to examine every minute aspect of his change. He watched as his nails slowly, almost imperceptibly, thickened and sharpened into cheetah claws, while his fingers grew thicker and covered in soft yellow and white fur with black spots..<br />
<br />
He looked up and saw that he was losing Dawn. He walked quickly to catch up to her. He could feel his cheetah penis hardening. He tried to get his animal instincts under control as he walked step by step to where Dawn now stood, reading through a science fiction novel.<br />
<br />
Zack stood there impatiently for another minute. He felt his ears stretching out and growing hotter. He felt one of them. It was two inches long and round, with cheetah fur. Then he noticed his shoes were tight. He removed them quickly, and his socks with them.<br />
<br />
His feet were turning into paws, and his legs were thickening up as well, gaining the muscle and bone structure needed to run fast. He was glad he wore baggy shorts today.<br />
<br />
He looked over and noticed a man down the aisle, open book in hand, with his head turned and staring straight at his legs. Zack turned to Dawn, still passively scanning the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Dawn, did you remember to set it so that nobody thinks this is unusual?&quot; he asked in a nervous voice.<br />
<br />
Dawn looked up from her book. &quot;Oh, shit. I forgot. On it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A relieved expression flashed on his face. He gritted his teeth, and his fangs grew out.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn pressed the button.<br />
<br />
After another anxious minute, Dawn closed the book and said &quot;Okay, I think I&#39;ll take this one. Could you buy it for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Zack said, looking to the front of the store and the checkout desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the least you could do. You know, for scaring the bejeezus out of me.&quot; She pushed the book into his chest, and he took it with his large furry hands. &quot;Now let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack mustered up what remained of his pride. He straightened his back and tried to give her his most serious look, despite the black nose, whiskers, cheetah fur and fangs. &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As casually as he could, Zack walked up to the front counter with Dawn smiling and wagging her tail beside him. Every customer they passed  ignored him and cheetah girl Dawn.  Together the two transformed friends walked up to the cashier.<br />
<br />
The cashier was a woman in her late thirties, with brown hair and glasses. She smiled pleasantly. &quot;That&#39;s a really nice book you picked out,&quot; she said as she scanned the book&#39;s barcode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...thanks,&quot; was all Zack could think of to say in his sexual arousal.<br />
<br />
Dawn hugged his arm and smiled at the cashier. &quot;I picked it out.&quot; Her tail brushed the back of Zack&#39;s ankles flirtatiously. He tried to keep a straight face, but his ears suddenly twitched by instinct.<br />
<br />
The cashier smiled. &quot;Good choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Dawn said with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Zack felt a pushing in the back of his pants and knew it had to be his cheetah tail growing in. He tried to stand still despite the growing discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, that&#39;s eight ninety-nine, please,&quot; the cashier said pleasantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right.&quot; He reached into his pocket, stuffing his feline hand inside. This caused his pants to shift a little and upset his crowded tail. He groaned a tiny bit...not as much as he could have, but enough to make the cashier&#39;s eyebrows quirk. &quot;Here you go.&quot;  Zack pulled out his wallet and opened it. However, his feline digits couldn&#39;t separate the dollar bills from each other. &quot;Umm, maybe you should...?&quot; he passed the wallet to Dawn.<br />
<br />
She used her slightly less thick cheetah hands to pull the correct amount out of his wallet and handed it to the cashier. She then accepted the change for Zack. &quot;Thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; The cashier said as Zack hurried Dawn toward the exit.<br />
<br />
Once outside, Zack took his wallet from Dawn and pocketed it with some effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s hurry to my apartment! I know what you&#39;ve been thinking. Let&#39;s do it there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yeah.&quot; It was taking all of his willpower now to stop from mating with Dawn then and there. &quot;Could you slow down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you made me a cheetah!&quot; Dawn said over her shoulder. &quot;Just try to keep up!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Dawn waved the remote in her hand and burst into a full run down the sidewalk, zooming away faster than Zack had ever seen anyone go.</p>
