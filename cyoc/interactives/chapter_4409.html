<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin was panting from the exertion of his mind-numbing orgasm, and simply looked up at Ty with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ty said, &quot;like Jeff, the size of your balls means a lot more testosterone going into your body, so you're going to see some changes even without me doing anything.  But it's gonna take awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin regained his composure, albeit with a very large appendage between his legs.  &quot;So, I'll get more muscular and stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded noncommitally, &quot;Yeah, but your body will change in other ways too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked momentarily confused.  &quot;Like how?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned mischieviously, &quot;Wouldn't it be easier to see for yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shrugged, &quot;Sure, but won't it take awhile?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, buddy, I've got the power, remember?  Time really has no meaning.  Because for the next five minutes, your body is going to process as much hormone as your new balls would produce in five years.  And trust me, you'll notice the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked surprised, but only for a moment.  His body kicked into massive overdrive, just as Ty had said.  And sure enough, changes began nearly instantly.<br />
<br />
First off, his body started to grow in nearly every direction.  Inches were packed onto his height as the seconds passed by, and Dustin's head slowly creeped above Ty's slowly but surely.  His musculature also began to enhance, as new muscle fibres conglomerated in all the right places.  The testosterone was certainly doing it's job.<br />
<br />
Ty watched, fascinated, not really sure how much Dustin's body would change over a five year span.  But what was done was done, and from the look on Dustin's face, he seemed to be enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Dustin's muscles continued to grow substantially, his biceps press outward into the sleeves of his T-shirt, and his pecs becoming well defined through the rapidly thinning fabric.  His legs, too, were pushing out, striations becoming visible through Dustin's already tight jeans.  The front was already ripped out, of course, from his gigantic member, but it looked like the seams of the legs wouldn't hold out long either.<br />
<br />
Ty began noticing other changes too.  The most obvious was the hair.  The first spots Ty noticed the difference was on Dustin's arms and crotch.  His crotch because it was plainly visible, and his arms because the hair had thickened considerably and was moving down onto the backs of Dustin's hands.  It was sprouting nearly everywhere, though, and soon began pushing right through his T-shirt, growing through the fabric in a regular, manly fashion.  It was most prominent between his pecs, traveling southward to a thickening patch around his navel, then even further to connect with his expanding pubes.<br />
<br />
Ty jumped involuntarily as Dustin's jeans ripped down the sides, exposing his legs, now in tree-trunk like proportions.  Although very furry trees.  His legs had become very hairy.  Not so much it looked abnormal yet, but Ty could see the hairs still thickening and lengthening and suspected they would look less than normal once the five minutes had passed.  His face also sported a scruffy beard, growing in at a rapid pace.<br />
<br />
Dustin was gasping through it all, barely able to move as the changes raced through his body.  And so far, only thirty seconds had passed.  About a year and a half.<br />
<br />
At this point, Ty realized he was looking up slightly to watch the hair continue it's trek across Dustin's manly pecs.  The pecs themselves were continuing to inflate, and the T-shirt had reached it's limit.  Slowly the seams began to rip, starting in Dustin's pits.  His shoulders had grown round and defined, and as the T-shirt gave way, Ty had his first glimpse of the impressive mats of hair that now decorated Dustin's pits.  The skin was not visible through the hair, and it looked like it was slowly creeping down the underside of his arm and towards his ribs.  The shirt ripped around his biceps next, showing the thickly veined mounds of muscle that now occupied the space.  The fabric draped itself about Dustin's neck, until those seams tore apart as well.<br />
<br />
Now, gravity is something most people understand.  Something not supported by something else underneath it is going to fall.  Now that Dustin's T-shirt had ripped away around his arms and neck, it would only make sense it would fall to drape itself about his waist.<br />
<br />
This didn't happen however.  Not in the front, anyway.<br />
<br />
Ty just stared as the T-shirt clung to Dustin's muscular front, held up only by the mat of hair that had grown through it.  The hairs had grown quite a bit longer, a good two inches in length at least, and had spread out to cover more area before the T-shirt had given way.  Ty mumbled to himself and in a blink the T-shirt vanished, giving him his first view of Dustin's transformed front.<br />
<br />
First of all, Dustin was huge and still growing, though it looked like his height had peaked.  He was tall enough now that Ty, reaching his arm straight up, could probably touch Dustin's chin.  His shoulders looked to be as wide as the breadth of Ty's arms, and the muscle!  Absolutely breath-taking!  <br />
<br />
Just over a minute had passed now, the equivalent of about two and a half years or so.  Dustin had stopped growing taller, and it looked like his muscles were slowing their growth as well, which made Ty wonder if he would change anymore.  Interestingly, his huge cock now looked nearly proportionate to his body, it's size complimenting Dustin's overgrown height and muscles.<br />
<br />
It looked like Dustin's expanding musculature had slowed to a crawl, but things were still progressing.  Hair continued it's relentless progression across Dustin's body.  His chest and stomach were now looking more like a pelt, and hair was creeping around his sides and up onto his shoulders.  Ty wandered around to check out Dustin's back, and was not all that surprised to see a thickening line of hair snaking it's way from his ass up his back.  Ty admired the view, then moved back around to the front.<br />
<br />
Dustin was beginning to look quite shaggy, with hair dangling off of his arms.  And his legs!  The hair had grown out substantially since Ty had last looked.  It hung in long strands at least four or five inches long, and was as thick as possible.  There was no skin visible.  Dustin's legs were as furry as furry could be, including the tops of his feet, which Ty noticed were incredibly large.<br />
<br />
Then, something curious began to happen.  Dustin's body began to shift.  His arms began stretching downward.  Currently, his hands rested just below his hips, but Ty could see they were sliding down.  He looked up to Dustin's shoulder, but it had not moved.  Dustin's arms were growing longer!  On closer inspection Ty realized they weren't just growing longer, but his biceps and forearms were growing proportionately bigger as well to accomodate the new length.<br />
<br />
Glancing up at Dustin's face, Ty could see changes there as well.  Aside from the hair, which now covered nearly the entire surface of Dustin's visage, his bones were shifting.  His bushy eyebrows were pushing outwards, and his jaw was doing the same.  His nostrils were also flaring outward and turning up slightly as his nose flattened inward.  Ty realized with a slight shock Dustin was looking a little simian in appearance!  Actually, not just a little, a lot!<br />
<br />
Dustin opened his mouth a little, groaning with what was likely a combination of pleasure and pain.  Ty could see why.  His gums were bleeding, and with good reason.  His incisors where growing slightly, while his canine teeth were growing substantially.  Not only that, but Dustin was grinding them together in a fervor, and they were slowly sharpening into rather fine points!  This seemed nearly impossible to Ty, that teeth could sharpen that quickly through simple grinding, but then the forces at work in Dustin's body were not exactly easy to understand.<br />
<br />
As the fourth minute passed, Dustin's fur coat evened itself out.  The hair on his body was nothing short of bestial, long and smooth.  It hung off his appendages, and if his cock wasn't at full attention, Ty guessed it would be well hidden in the mass of pubic hair.  Although Dustin's pubes were completely straight and supple, like the hair on the rest of his body.  None of it looked like body hair anymore, but really more like fur.  Ty ran his fingers through the hair on Dustin's belly, and Dustin moaned slightly.  'Like my own, overgrown puppy dog,' Ty thought to himself with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
As the final minute passed, no more major changes affected Dustin.  His fur continued to grow out, leaving him astonishingly shaggy, and his sharp, lower teeth had pushed themselves up and out of his mouth, resulting in a pronounced underbite.<br />
<br />
Then, there was a nearly inaudible 'ding', not unlike the chime of an egg-timer.<br />
<br />
Ty took a couple steps back as Dustin broke from his reverie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Dustin breathed, his voice startlingly bass and slightly slurred do to his new facial orientation.  Ty felt the vibration in his body, like standing in front of the speakers at a concert.  &quot;Listen to my voice!  That was fucking unbelievable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty whistled.  &quot;You don't know the half of it.  Take a look at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin tilted his furry head down, witnessing the changes that had severely altered his body.  He was speechless for a moment.  His big, hairy hands explored his body, shuddering at the unexpected new sensations all his fur gave him.  &quot;Wow...this is...wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled.  &quot;You're certainly a sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm like a big gorilla!  Look at my arms, they're so long!  And all this hair?!  Shit man, I can't go out in public like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, Dustin!&quot; Ty replied, &quot;I'd hardly expect you would.  Just enjoy it for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I like it.  It's just so...so different!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin tried moving around a bit.  He lumbered this way and that, though his new size left him little space to wander in Ty's room.  The floor complained a bit under the new weight it was supporting.  &quot;Shit, Ty!  How tall do you suppose I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gauged, &quot;Well, you're about a half foot shorter than the cieling.  I think that puts you at about seven and a half feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin laughed, the sound reverberating off the walls and rattling the window.  &quot;This is fucking awesome!  I'm gargantuan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg, man.  Want me to change you some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin considered.  &quot;I haven't really had a chance to try this body out yet, though.  Think you could just make some more enhancements or changes to what I've already got?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Dustin boomed, &quot;How about you...&quot;</p>
