<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica Smith had made a lot of enemies at work, so many that the curse was unsure of what to do with Jen&#39;s idea, so it honed in on the one person that could cause all of those problems, Smith herself. Jen walked down the stairs and into the kitchen, where her mother was sitting, she was disheveled as usual for the first hour of her morning, still topless, covered in a robe and wearing only her panties, her father had gone to work by now, and Martha had made breakfast and was off doing whatever she needed to do that morning.<br />
<br />
Jen took a seat across from her mother and glanced up, seeing the same woman she saw every morning, she knew better than to bother her when she was drinking her first cup of coffee. She started eating taking a bite and glancing back up, then she dropped her fork. Sitting across from her was her mother, or at least her head, now mounted on the smaller body of a teenage boy. Jen nearly screamed, but held herself together, knowing that no one else, including her mother would know of the changes. Then a sudden sense of dread and remorse washed over her, not only could she not change her mother back, she knew Kyle would have and be using her body from now on. Then she swallowed, Kyle was about to masturbate with her mother&#39;s body, and she made him do it.<br />
<br />
“Jen? What&#39;s wrong? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.”<br />
<br />
“Um... nothing.” <br />
<br />
“Well, whatever it is, try not to worry about it. I&#39;ve got a big math test coming up, do you see me worrying?”<br />
<br />
“Um... no.” Jen muttered to her still mother and now class mate, her status in the family hadn&#39;t changed, she just went to school now.... Jen tried not to imagine that body sleeping next to her dad as she shoveled food into her mouth, wanting to forget what was going on across town.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked in the mirror and gasped, standing there in the mirror was the body of a very well built milf, with his teen head mounted on it&#39;s slender neck, his new full lips looked strange on his pale face. He looked himself over, or at least tried to as his hands started to move on their own. THE CURSE! Kyle tried to stop, his new slim hands disobeyed him and started messaging his new breasts, his body fell back on the bed as it&#39;s legs started to squeeze together, manipulating the muscles of his new pussy, sending waves of pleasure through his mind as he gave into the act, unable to stop he just went along with it. He moaned softly as his body played with itself, taking it&#39;s time as it pleasured itself, the climax almost but not quiet cresting repeatedly until he finally, blissfully cooing was hit by the first female orgasm of the rest of his life, he gasped moaning loudly as he cam, shaking and shivering in ecstasy he had never felt before. Whoever this body used to belong to got a raw deal, he realized now that Jen hadn&#39;t damned him but given him a gift. He lay there panting, as he looked at his new bust raising up and down, he caught his breath and finally sat up.<br />
<br />
On trembling legs he walked over to the mirror again and started looking over this body, she was curvy, with a thinner waist, over all she was pair shaped, her hips on the wide side, her plump ass a large round almost heart shape. He turned to the side, seeing his new breasts rested with a sag, obviously an older woman, Kyle knew the curse might fix this by the end of his day, with the body youthening as he went along. His new form was similar to his mom, save for the wider hips, he was relieved that he didn&#39;t end up with a stripper, or worse, or did he? Kyle walked over to the closet and hesitated.<br />
<br />
“Please don&#39;t be in porn, or stripping or...&#39; Kyle opened the door and sighed a breath of relief, hanging in his closet were white blouses, with knee length skirts and sensible kitten heel pumps, there were a few tennis shoes and boots, but he felt drawn to these articles of clothing, his body trying to lead him through her motions, he followed her lead, she knew how she dressed, he was just her owner now. He lay out the outfit and put on his underwear, discarding the old pair of panties where were now wet, he cleaned his new pussy with some tissues he had in his room. He found himself having slight trouble with the pantyhose, but his bodies hands took control and did the motion, the curse would force him to dress like her, whether he was able to or not, so he watched and learned. Having dressed completely he realized two things, the first was that all of his clothes were purposely a size too small, it seemed that the original owner was either in denial or a show off, since they strained against her full figure. And second was that his bust was much more apparent in a bra, making a decent valley of cleavage as his body refused to button the blouse all the way up, he had given up on the third try.<br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he was forgetting something in his outfit, he looked around the room and couldn&#39;t figure it out, his body took control one last time and walked him over to his dresser, picking up a little jewelry box that he hadn&#39;t noticed, his hands opened it, showing it&#39;s contents. Kyle took the hint and took out the accessories, a gold necklace with a cross on the end, a ring that was obviously a copy of her wedding ring, and a name badge, the last caught his eye and he gasped.<br />
<br />
“Jessica Smith?!?” Kyle said. “Jen&#39;s own mother? Really?” He looked over his reflection again, “Damn she was hot.... and now it&#39;s all mine. Oh Jen must be screaming right now.” Kyle chuckled, pinning the name tag on his new chest. “Well, wait til she gets a look at me!” Kyle said as he grabbed his back pack and went to the kitchen. Kyle sat down and started eating breakfast with his mother.<br />
<br />
“Looking lovely today dear, I see your going natural today.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I really didn&#39;t feel like makeup today.” Kyle improvised.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s nice just to go natural sometimes, makes you feel pretty when people look at you without your face on.”<br />
<br />
“I know, it&#39;s too bad I can&#39;t do that with bras.”<br />
<br />
“Now, now, you don&#39;t want to show too much, make the boys work for it!” <br />
<br />
They both laughed and finished breakfast, Kyle left for school, walking down the sidewalk to the bus stop, feeling his new body jiggle in strange ways, he felt confident and proud, not only had Jen screw herself, he&#39;d get to rub her face in it later when he saw her. Kyle got on the bus, and sat down in his seat, Jarred got on and timidly sat next to him, obviously shy around the gorgeous woman he now was, Kyle began the conversation.</p>
