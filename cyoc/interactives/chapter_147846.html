<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After group that evening Dr. Burton went back to his office. He had several good break throughs today. Levar’s new wasn’t easy for him to take knowing he was turning into such a petite and sexy girl. However he seemed to make a real breakthrough today emotionally.<br />
<br />
Once back in his office Dr. Burton checked on some emails and he saw he had an urgent one from his colleague Dr. Samuel Steinbeck. He was a brilliant physiologist who pioneered many of the trainings for second Puberty used in the field today.<br />
<br />
The email simply said. “Call me...”<br />
<br />
Dr. Steinbeck wouldn’t address such an email unless it meant something. Not wasting much time he picked up the phone and dialed.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” Dr. Steinbeck answered.<br />
<br />
“Hello Sam, It’s Leonard. (She used to be Leslie)” Dr. Burton. Replied.<br />
<br />
“Leonard, it’s good to hear from you. How goes the support group?” Dr. Steinbeck asked.<br />
<br />
It was common knowledge that Dr. Steinbeck didn’t approve of Dr. Burton’s group therapy. He believed Second Puberty needed to be addressed on a personal level individually with each person through single counseling sessions.<br />
<br />
Dr. Burton didn’t disagree with this method. He just believed that there were too many people suffering out there to handle this problem one at a time. His group therapy experiment was designed to offer as much help as possible.<br />
<br />
“It’s good. We have had some major breakthroughs. I have a teenager football stall well on his way to becoming a bikini model and he is showing remarkable improvement.” Dr. Burton replied.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s good to hear. I’m sure you are wondering for the reason for my urgent email. I have an opportunity for you Leonard but this is a time sensitive matter and I need a reply ASAP. I have a case here. Unlike any other I have ever seen. I believe we might actually have our first documentable Black Lotus....” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
The Black Lotus was just a myth...A hypothesis in the Second Puberty community. It refers to a subject who is undergoing a a very unique and very drastic transformation. Hyper sexual in nature and extreme to the point of causing drastic shifts in personality.<br />
<br />
However was makes the Black Lotus so unique is the nature of the transformation. It doesn’t progress the typical way through a slow three step method that takes weeks. <br />
<br />
The Black Lotus transformation is rapid, drastic, and very painful. You can visibly see the changes happen. They come in short painful waves almost like contractions to a pregnant woman giving birth. These waves can hit at any time and cause the subject to undergo a rapid change in part of their body. The total process can take days or weeks to complete, depending on the subject.<br />
<br />
The reason the Black Lotus is a myth is no one has successfully documented anyone changing this way. When Second Puberty was first appearing in humans stories emerged of people first changing this way. Rapidly and violently. However most Doctors now believe that this may have been just the first wave of subjects exposed to whatever caused second Puberty in the first place. Over time the condition adapted better to human bodies and now takes it current form over a long three stage period to better help the subject adapt.<br />
<br />
“Tell me about the subject.” Dr. Burton said wanting to know more.<br />
<br />
“16 year old male runaway. Youngest child in a family of five. Comes from a very religious background. To make matters worse his family converted to Pure Bodies about three years ago.” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“Oh no...not those zealots...” Dr Burton said. <br />
<br />
Pure Bodies were a group of religious extremists who believed Second Puberty was a curse only afflicted upon those God deemed sinful or damned as a punishment. They would regularly speak out about discrimination against those they called “The Infected.”<br />
<br />
“Yes...Apparently the Mother had a younger brother who underwent second Puberty and once he had become a woman his family disowned him. The brother killed him self out of shame and depression. Feeling like his second Puberty was a curse.” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“That is awful. So did the boy run away when he first noticed his body changing?” Dr. Burton asked.<br />
<br />
“Well...sort of. He didn’t experience a slow change. One day he just woke up and his nails were growing right in front of them...They grew out over an inch long right in front of his eyes...When he cut them. They just grew right back...” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“That’s...that’s impossible...He saw his own changes?” Dr. Burton said in shock.<br />
<br />
“Fearing for his life he left his family and cane looking for me. He knew me because his family would regularly protest outside my clinic.” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“That’s ironic...Did you confirm this?” Dr. Burton asked.<br />
<br />
“I did...it’s real Leonard. I trimmed his nails<br />
Myself and watched them grow back within a minute. It was fascinating.” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“Well...what do you need me for?” Dr. Burton replied.<br />
<br />
“Well...that’s the thing. The boy his name is Joshua. We performed an Early Body Determination on him and the results were....well...see for yourself.” Dr Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
An email attachment suddenly came through as Dr. Burton saw a photo came through. Opening it up Dr. Burton looked at the photo with shock and disbelief. Dr. Burton had dealt with many extreme cases of hyper sexual development score but nothing like this...<br />
<br />
The photo was of a woman with perfectly tanned skin that looked like shinning bronze. It was perfectly smooth and glistened in the light. She had jet black hair that was almost as long as her body going all the way down to her ankles. She had inch and a half long fingernails that were also jet black just like her toenails. <br />
<br />
She had massive large breasts. They were also not natural looking at all being perfectly rounded and very perky. Looking like two perfect globes attached to her chest. <br />
<br />
She had a total hourglass figure and large bubble butt with long shapely legs. Her face was seductive looking with full pouty lips and long dark eyelashes.<br />
<br />
The woman in the photo looked like a sexual fantasy come to life. Dr. Burton had never seen such a strong reaction.<br />
<br />
“Dear God...are you positive?” Dr Burton asked looking over the picture.<br />
<br />
“Yes...we took multiple tests to confirm. Blood tests also show a libido strength of 9...” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“This is insane...” Dr. Burton said.<br />
<br />
Libido strength was measured on a scale from<br />
 1-10. One represented someone totally asexual with no desires whatsoever for anything. 10 represented someone who was a total mindless sex machine. They couldn’t think or do anything that revolve around sex.<br />
<br />
“I know...that’s why I called you. This boy is young and scared. He doesn’t know what is happening to his body and is now a ward of the state. Our Doctor status gives us the right to offer sanctuary to anyone who’s second Puberty status puts their lives in danger. What I am asking isn’t easy...I want you to take the boy. Watch over him and help him. Not just as a patient but as a guardian.” Dr. Steinbeck said.<br />
<br />
“You mean let him live with me? Like adopt him?” Dr. Burton asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes...only until he fully transforms and becomes a female. Once she is stable and comfortable and able to take care of herself you can let her go. This is the chance of a lifetime Leonard. A chance to have a true Black Lotus to document. However more important this is a child who is scared and needs help...will you do it?” Dr Steinbeck asked.</p>
