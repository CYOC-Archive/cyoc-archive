<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Loki decided to go to one of the houses on the street, he stood there for a while deciding on which one to pick and then finally knew which one to pick. Smiling mischeviously he walked over to the house and rang the doorbell, he waited for a few moments before it was opened by an average looking guy. He was slightly shorter than Loki, and neither was attractive nor ugly with messy brown hair, a fair skin tone, brown eyes and slightly unhealthy proportions. The man looked at Loki with a confused expression and raised an eyebrow, Loki took a minute to examine what he was wearing in the few short moments of awkward silence after the man had opened the door. The man was wearing a blue polo shirt, with cargo shorts and white socks that adorned small size 9 feet. As the man was considering closing the door on Loki, Loki held out his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m your new neighbour,&quot; lied Loki smiling nicely at the man before him. The man smiled nervously, Loki could instantly tell he wasn&#39;t good in social situations. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh err hey, thank you. Yeah I just moved in recently,&quot; said the man shaking Loki&#39;s hand. Loki continued to smile from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so? Well yeah, it&#39;s such a good neighbour. Mind if I come in?&quot; asked Loki, the man shook his head and held the door open for Loki to enter the household. It was quite a small house, but it looked compact giving off an instant cozy comfortable vibe. Loki despised it. &quot;Such a nice place you have here. What&#39;s your name?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, my name&#39;s Bryce, yours?&quot; replied Bryce, Loki raised an eyebrow at Bryce for a short moment before reluctantly putting up his &#39;neighbur&#39; facade once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s not important,&quot; said Loki. Bryce looked at Loki somewhat confused, and Loki knew that he would have to do something soon if he wanted to have any more fun. &quot;Do you like feet, Bryce?&quot; Bryce now looked at Loki with a very confused expression but found himself slightly blushing. Bryce never had an interest in feet, yet something was changing in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No! Why would I like that stuff?&quot; exclaimed Bryce, he felt like he was lying though it was true, he never liked feet. Or did he? <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you must love mens feet, fondling them, worshipping them, in fact aren&#39;t you gay Bryce?&quot; cooed Loki, he was back to his mischevious smile as he could almost feel Bryce change with every word that he uttered. Bryce was completley blushing, and Loki looked around his house as it slightly changed. Bryces calendar showing the month &#39;June&#39; with a typical sunset picture overhead, changed to showing &#39;June&#39; with the picture of a muscled sexy man smirking as he teased the viewer by half taking off his underwear. As well as this, Loki could see Bryces black hair shift to brown and styling itself up slighly to resemble a fauxhawk style. &quot;Maybe you should head to the bathroom Bryce.&quot; Bryce felt the instant need to rush off to the bathroom despite not needing to use the toilet and he did so locking the door. Loki went upstairs and stood outside the bathroom door, and laughing quietly to himself snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
As soon as he snapped his fingers Bryce began feeling nothing but pleasurable orgasms as he began changing. His socks started to strain as his feet began to grow, his toes involuntarily wiggling and almost teasing Bryce, Bryce wanted to cry out and beg for this to stop but he only managed out a hushed &quot;No&quot; as the changes started to affect the rest of his body. His calves began to become toned and muscular as brown hair began growing on them, Bryce tried to put pressure on his calves with his hands to stop the changes to his legs, but it clearly didn&#39;t work. His cargo trousers ripped under the pressure of his muscular legs.  His hips were next, as his ass began to become more curved and slimmer looking feeling sexy as &#39;Calvin Klein&#39; underwear began to replace his own cheap boxers. His groans became louder and he wanted the changes to stop as his penis began to erect and pre-cum as it grew to a massive 10&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no, stop, please,&quot; moaned Bryce, Loki was on the other side of the door giggling to himself as he listened in intently. Bryce soon felt a six-pack form on his abdomen, as chest hair and a treasure trail sprouted on his torse and his nipples jutted out erotically. His hands grew larger becoming more calloused as hair grew on the back of them and over his arms which were becoming much more musclular. He began flexing involuntarily as his shirt ripped, his pecs bouncing and his biceps flexing. His neck was next as his adams apple grew and his neck thickened his groans sounding as if they were coming from a completley different voice.<br />
<br />
Loki was still outside and whispered &quot;The final changes, coming up.&quot; Before giggling as he listened in, intently. <br />
<br />
Bryce now looked in the mirror now noticing the new hair style, his feet still expanding straining his socks to the limit. Bryce felt himself grow a five&#39;o&#39;clock shadow as his chin became more chiselled and sexy. Still groaning and unable to speak or call for help, he felt his ears become slightly larger as his nose became more flat. He was forced to shut his eyes tight as he felt them sting, however opened them to see they had changed to a crystal blue. After a while, the transformation seemed to stop that was until he heard a rip. He looked down to see his new large sexy feet still wiggling their toes and stretching as if teasing Bryce as they grew larger. His feet had to be at least size 14 as his toes were long, lean and sexy. His mind became clouded for a few seconds as the nails on his feet changed to look more well trimmed and looked after whilst more hair sprouted on the top of them. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Bryce loved men, he had been homosexual for years and he had a passionate foot fetish. He stepped out, feeling as if he had a visitor in the home, but when he looked around he saw nobody there. Now Bryce had crystal blue eyes, size 14 feet with hot sexy large muscles and a drawer full of Calvin Klein underwear as well as many stinky shoes for men to sniff and posters of sexy men all over his beside wall. Bryce smirked and got ready to go out and pick up some attractive studs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Loki was outside laughing maniacly at what he had just done, he was having far too much fun and this time decided go to...</p>
