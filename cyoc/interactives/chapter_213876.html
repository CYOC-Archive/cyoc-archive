<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie watched Veles walk past and frowned, his asshole twitching strangely.<br />
<br />
The wolf gently rubbed the back of his pants and the muscle relaxed. For a split second, he’d almost mistaken the fox for Finn. In fact, if he took away the arctic coat, he’d swear the little fox was a perfect clone. Well,  if Finn were a twunk and not a huge fat nerd. And he also had a nagging suspicion that something about even that was wrong, but he couldn’t put his finger on what.<br />
<br />
Glitz walked out after him, the golden-antlered stag wiping his hooflets off with a cloth. <br />
<br />
“All finished. I must say, he looks quite handsome now that he’s twenty years younger and skinny,” Glitz smiled, watching the little fox’s bulbous ass cheeks bounce as he trounced into the den.<br />
<br />
“You do good work.” Charlie nodded.<br />
<br />
The black-furred wolf summoned his courage. If he was going to do this, it was now or never. They really needed to hide their presence going forward. The deer had brought the Prince back, but he’d only done that because Charlie had paid him a coin – a coin that obligated Glitz to provide Charlie with a service and a smile.  But it was a smile that was possibly faked.  <br />
<br />
Glitz was  an information broker.  He didn’t have friends, he had clients. Glitz would tell anyone with a coin whatever they wanted to know about the party.  Hell, given the Order’s network in this world, Glitz could very well send that information on ahead of them, to be sold to enemies that they didn’t even know they had yet.<br />
<br />
It was unacceptable.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Charlie ran a paw over the stag’s chest and smiled, “I never thanked you for your help.”<br />
<br />
Glitz paused. Charlie’s heart began to pound. Was the stag going to reject him? If he did, it was all over and he’d have to resort to more violent methods.<br />
<br />
“Oh ho, you think you can handle me?” Glitz smirked, stroking Charlie’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
“I think,” the wolf stepped forward, a real smile spreading across his face, and sniffed the hind’s neck ruff softly, “that I’ve been thinking about you for a while.”<br />
<br />
Glitz smelled amazing. It was actually enough to have his cock slip free of his sheathe and make his pants bulge lewdly. He found his breath quicken and Glitz cocked an eye, noticing how heated Charlie was getting.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you have a boyfriend or three to take care of?” Glitz chuckled.<br />
<br />
“If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have three boyfriends. Hell, I wouldn’t have a party.” Charlie shrugged, reaching up and undoing the stag’s tie.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” Glitz smiled and began undressing the wolf. “I guess that’s true. But you don’t know what I’m into, or if you’re even my type.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, I’ll be like anyone else who has attempted to woo you,” Charlie winked.<br />
<br />
“’Woo’ me?” Glitz snorted and maneuvered them both back into the tailoring room as they kissed muzzles. “I am un-woo able.”<br />
<br />
While the stag closed the door behind them, Charlie pulled out the empty soul jar and waited for the stag to find somewhere to sit.<br />
<br />
“Are you a top or a bottom?” Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
“Should have asked before the whole woo-ing, don’t you think?” Glitz grinned. “Does it matter to you?”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m a switch.” Charlie smiled and brushed a paw over Glitz’ crotch, feeling it twitch.<br />
<br />
Glitz dropped his pants and let his slender pink rod spring into view. “Suck it.”<br />
<br />
Charlie dropped to his knees and sniffed the hind’s musk before giving the tip and experimental lick.<br />
<br />
It tasted clean. He engulfed the slender thing in his mouth, twirling his tongue along its length, and bobbed. The deer moaned above him, placing an encouraging hooflet on the top of Charlie’s head.<br />
<br />
Charlie surreptitiously slid the soul jar underneath the hind and popped the lid.<br />
<br />
The effect was immediate. The cock in Charlie’s mouth belched a shimmery substance that he immediately spit into the jar below. It was the silvery liquid that made up a person’s very soul in this world. And just like how the hag captured her victims, he would have to stroke this deer to completion.<br />
<br />
Charlie kept his hand on the deer’s cock and slowly got to his feet, kissing the stag’s muzzle. He’d expected a complaint, but the hind did nothing but moan, his meager muscles slimming away. The wolf felt a little bad about doing this to the golden-antler-stag, but Glitz was too dangerous to leave alive.<br />
<br />
He jerked the deer off, watching his antlers fall off and clatter to the floor, before vanishing into a cloud of fine dust. It didn’t take much before Glitz looked less like a stag and more like a kitten. A mewling, needy cat boi with a dick that was rapidly shrinking in Charlie’s grip. <br />
<br />
With a final yowl, Glitz came hard, soul-stuff rocketing into the jar below. <br />
<br />
Charlie gently pumped the kitty’s cock, coaxing the last bits of soul juice out of the panting feline. The he closed the jar and picked the kitten up. He was very light, now, and nuzzled and cuddled Charlie tightly.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, that’s a good kitty,” Charlie cooed, setting the catboi down on the tailoring pedestal.<br />
<br />
He moved over to the door and opened it. Veles walked in, the little white-furred fox’s eyes glittering as he saw the remains of Glitz. Reaching into his Bag of Holding, the fox brought out Fergus’ brother’s soul jar.<br />
<br />
“Fergus is going to be so happy to have his brother back!” Veles yipped.<br />
<br />
“Yes,“ Charlie turned and shoved the jar into the catboi’s paws. “Drink this.”<br />
<br />
“Okay!” the catboi mindlessly giggled.<br />
<br />
He chugged it.<br />
<br />
Immediately, the cat’s body swelled with fat and muscle, face growing porcine, nose upturned, ears floppy. A guard’s uniform appeared on his body as he visibly aged to around his early forties, wrinkles appearing on his face. Soon, a fat pig guard was sitting there, looking around him in shock.<br />
<br />
“W-where am I?” the constable asked.<br />
<br />
“In The Order’s headquarters in town. You were turned into a catboi by the hag.” Charlie said.<br />
<br />
“Oh…The Order?!” The hog leapt up, spry for a creature so fat.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Fergus is going to be so happy to see you again,” Charlie said. “Unless you divulge the secret location of The Order. In which case, you never come back at all, understand?”<br />
<br />
The hog nodded.<br />
<br />
Charlie began to open his mouth, only to be cut off as Veles chirped “Welcome back Seamus!  Good to see you again!”<br />
<br />
“Veles?  Oh thank the gods.  Turns out getting your soul drained by a hag isn’t all its cracked up to be,” Seamus said as he wiped a hand across his brow.<br />
<br />
“So Veles,” Seamus chuckled, “you back to your old adventuring days, or did you just make an exception for little old me?”<br />
<br />
“Back to adventuring I’m afraid,” Veles said as he rotated his body, showing off his much younger frame to the old hog, “recently gave my body a bit of a tune up, Fergus might have some trouble keeping up with me now!”<br />
<br />
“Hah!” Seamus chuckled, “I’ll bet he’ll love to get a look of that!  So, where are we off to?”<br />
<br />
“WE are off to nowhere,” Charlie interjected, “Veles is coming with us, and you’ll be going back to your wife and kids now-”<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Seamus said, his doublechin quivering. “Not…can we wait on that? For, say…ever?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Veles asked, cocking his head.<br />
<br />
“I…hate me life.” Seamus scratched the back of his neck. “That’s why I went after the hag. I figured, you know, if she got me I’d be happy and if I got her, I’d be able to get enough coin together to leave my wife and kids and move to another country.”<br />
<br />
“And what about me and Fergus, you were just going to leave us too!?!” Veles snarled.<br />
<br />
“Look, Veles, Shirley is a much different person when no one is around,” Seamus glowered, “she might seem like a tender lass, but sometimes I wonder if she’s actually part demon.”<br />
<br />
Charlie paced, thinking to himself.<br />
<br />
They had an opportunity here. He’d taken care of Glitz, but if anyone from the Order came to inspect the place, they’d find out he was missing. That would most certainly mean an investigation and their crime would be found out. And then they’d have to deal with a fraternal order of assassins hunting them down.<br />
<br />
“What if you were Glitz?”<br />
<br />
“Eh?” Seamus asked.<br />
<br />
“The owner of this establishment. You can hide here. Fergus will be upset, but…well…who gives a shit.”<br />
<br />
“I give a shit!” Veles said hotly. “He’s my boyfriend!”<br />
<br />
“Whom we are leaving behind in a few days. Come on.” Charlie rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Veles crossed his arms. “Problem is, we can’t have him gulping soul essence whenever he wants to pretend to be Glitz, because that stag is gonna roll this little piggy over.”<br />
<br />
“I am not a little piggy,” Seamus sputtered, his pink hide spotting red.<br />
<br />
“No, you’re a big hog, I’m sorry,” Veles patted his arm.<br />
<br />
“That’s not-!”<br />
<br />
“Anyways, we need to Tailor him very, very carefully.” Veles finished. “And the only person who knows how to do that is currently in a jar.”<br />
<br />
“Can we find his spellbook? Notes?” Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
“That is exactly what I was going to suggest.” Veles’ vulpine muzzle stretched into a happy grin. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Veles the arctic fox wizard was delighted at the recent run of events.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t been sure how he would go about stealing as much of Glitz’ magic as he could get away with. Not without Charlie getting suspicious. He didn’t want the wolf to know that ever since he’d experienced Polymorph magic, he wanted more. Veles wanted to transform other people, and not haphazardly either. He wanted to do it with style, just like Glitz did<br />
<br />
And now he had his excuse.<br />
<br />
“Detect Magic!” Veles intoned, flicking his fingers.<br />
<br />
The entire room lit up. Here and there, magical auras glowed from enchanted pieces of equipment and traps and arcane locks…Veles rubbed his palms together greedily. This was clearly a wizard’s atelier. Somewhere in this room was Glitz’ spellbook. An item that would give him all the instructions the little fox needed to transform people with great precision.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he faltered.<br />
<br />
Why was he so interested in transforming people? Didn’t he just want to live with his sugar daddy and enjoy all the modern conveniences he had brought into the world? And yet there was this compulsion within him that made him less than content with such a simple lot in life. Why be normal when he could be a god?<br />
<br />
A strong glow between gaps in the mirrors caught his eye.<br />
<br />
Veles moved swiftly over to the mirror and checked the area for secret buttons to press and he found one on the side of a mirror. With a click, the mirror swung out and a book in a case was revealed behind it. Veles waved his hand, undoing the arcane lock.<br />
<br />
Carefully, he lifted the spellbook out and flipped through it. <br />
<br />
It was everything he ever wanted. The fox moved to a desk in the back of the room and started taking notes. He pulled out his own spellbook and started copying things. Hours passed.<br />
<br />
“Uh, you ready?” Charlie finally asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmmph,” Veles blinked, looking around the room. “Oh! Yes. Have the constable stand on the pedestal.”<br />
<br />
In a few short minutes, Seamus was indistinguishable from the stag. <br />
<br />
All that was left in the jar was the rest of the stag’s power and his mind and memories, but even that wasn’t to last. With greedy eyes, Veles used his newfound knowledge to separate out Glitz’ power before downing it in a single gulp. . <br />
<br />
Charlie saw Veles’ eyes flash with blue lightning, and his hand instinctively dropped to the hilt of one of his swords.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Charlie asked as Veles’ eyes returned to normal.<br />
<br />
“Yup! Right as rain!” Veles grinned, knowledge etching itself in his mind. “Let’s go. Seamus, your new name is Glitz. Have fun.”<br />
<br />
Charlie and Veles turned and began walking out of the room, leaving behind a contented Seamus, who began to explore his new cervine body as he thought of the possibilities that his new position might imbue on him.<br />
<br />
Once they were out in the hallway, Veles turned to Charlie and yipped, “okay! Now lets loot the rooms here and get back to the caravan.” <br />
<br />
“I’m not sure we should do that,” Charlie said quietly. “What if someone found out?”<br />
<br />
“Well…shit. Okay, let’s just get Geoffrey some adamantine-tipped gloves and boots.” Veles conceded.<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded.<br />
<br />
They left the shop with the gloves gift-wrapped and went back to the inn with their loot. Veles took Fergus into a private room and spent the better part of an hour explaining what happened to Seamus and why. The pig didn’t seem to be very irate about the whole thing. Apparently, for as much as she had been hidden from Veles, the wife was a total nag.<br />
<br />
As Veles prepared to leave town, he couldn’t help but realize how different he felt towards Fergus.  Just a few days ago he’d agonized over the decision to up and leave. But now…well, he saw the pig as something of a nuisance. It was strange. He knew that they had a close bond, but…his new urges took precedent. And he knew that the only way to explore them was to go adventuring with the rest of the party.  It just made it all feel so… ok.<br />
<br />
As the others got settled in their rooms for their last night in town, Veles wondered if Glitz had done something more than just aging him down and turning him into a wizard.</p>
