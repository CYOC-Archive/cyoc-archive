<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The queen looked up at Adam and the man he had become, he was the definition of power, the ultimate warrior warlock, built and bread for combat, and to rule at her side, she grinned up at him as she reached her hands behind his neck and began to gently pull him closer, until their faces were only a few inches apart, Adam&#39;s hot breath hit the queen&#39;s skin and it was like the desert itself had kissed her with its scorching breeze, his chest heaved as he took his breaths, his large body trying to be so careful with her as he effortlessly held his weight off of her body, until finally their lips met.<br />
<br />
The Queen had never been kissed, not in the many centuries she had been alive, she had never experienced a man, nore a woman&#39;s tender and loving touch, but now she didn&#39;t know if she could go back to being like that, her mouth was locked with Adam&#39;s, her soft lips pressed firmly against his, his tongue began dipping into her mouth, enticing hers to do the same before they became entangled in one another, almost as if they were both trying to get a permanent taste of eachother to linger on their tongues as both of them Moaned from each others flavour.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Adam&#39;s large strong hands held her hips as he effortlessly rolled them over until he was laying on the wooden table with the queen straddled over the top of him, now on her knees, both either side of Adam hips, her pussy now mear inches away from Adams new member, it was as thick as her fist at least, and as long as her forearm, now permanently erect as his powerful heart pumped his cock full of ritch blood, his testicle were no different, each ball now resembling that of a prized bull in size, yet had no sag to them, not that the queen could see due to her large ass and swolen womb, but the fingers she traced accross it&#39;s surface told her all she would need to know &quot; my Adam, do you love your queen?&quot; She Slurred as she began grinding her hungry cunny against his member, Adam then met the queen&#39;s eyes, determined to please his queen &quot;with all that I am and ever will be my queen, I love you, and always will&quot; said Adam, jumping slightly from his now deeper voice, which only got a groan of pleasure from the queen, but suddenly she stopped moving, placing her hands over her belly before letting out a sigh and a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Linda you foolish witch, you thought that cursing me to be forever pregnant with my son would hinder my plans, oh poor girl, you have only made my conquest that much easier&quot; laughed the queen as the pink smoke of the witches began to crawl along her legs, before the mist picked up speed, striking like a viper at the queen&#39;s pussy, stretching it wide as it seeped inside, the queen moaned in plesure as she leaned down  and embraced Adam as she felt the mist seep deeper and deeper into her folds, Adam only wrapped his arms around his queen to support her as the mist continued to seep into her folds as Adam&#39;s thoughts drowned out her screamed of plesure as her hips bucked and grinned against the mist &#39;who would curse his queen?, and why something so cruel as to never let her hold her baby in her arms, to never see her child grow up, if he ever found them he would surely make them pay for hurting his queen, his love&#39;, Adam was suddenly brought back to reality as the Queen now once again straddled his member, her belly now glowing pink as faces and hands pressed out from her belly, the queen desperately held her writhing womb, her face flushed red as her tongue hung from her mouth as she Moaned in plesure.<br />
<br />
Adam&#39;s mind was suddenly drawn elsewhere, down towards his loves pussy, its sent now unbearably good, his member began to rise to meet it, now pressed firm against her folds as some primal drive began to consume his mind, he wanted her, he wanted to BREED her, to make her mind addicted to his member and his alone, he wanted to make her pregnant swell even bigger with HIS brood, he wanted to watch her swell with his children and watch them move beneath her skin, suddenly a feeling of wetness began trickling down his member as he looked down, only to see the Queesn pussy drooling over his member, her juices now almost covering his cock, when he then gently grabbed onto the queen&#39;s hips and lifted her into the air as he stood up on the table with her in his arms, the queen let out a squeel as she was lifted into the air like a rag doll, with such care and gentleness, but that all changed when she saw the smirk on Adam&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;My queen, after today no other man will be able to please you like I will&quot; he whispered into her ear, getting a shiver to run down the queen&#39;s back, he then Megan kissing along her jaw line as he began easing her body onto his member, the queen let out a light breathed moan as her sensetive lips were forced apart widely, holding onto Adam&#39;s frame for support as he speared her with his shift &quot;yes Adam, come into me, skewer me on your cock, show me how worthy you are to stand at my side&quot; moaned the queen as she lifted herself to be eye level with Adam, her twitching and moving womb now pressed against his muscles as she wrapped her arms around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And prove myself I shall my queen&quot; whispered Adam as he then began to playfully nibble on the queen&#39;s ear lobe, listening to her moans of pleasure as she turned her head into him, letting him nibble more of her ear and neck, but then he simply let her go and the queen let out an orgasmic scream, she did not fall to the ground, she couldn&#39;t even if she wanted to, as she came back to her senses she looked past her large round belly to see Adam full mast buried to the hilt in her folds, that was all that was holding her up, Adam grinned at the queen and the state he had left her in, like her he had wanted her since the moment they had met, and now he had her all to himself, so beautiful so perfect, she was his now and he was hers, Adam smiled and brought his hands over the queen&#39;s hips as he brought his head down to kiss her hungrily, she gladly returned the jester as she groaned into his lips as he lifted her swolen form from his member slightly, then watching as the queen&#39;s eyes became wide as she realised what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Adam grinned and then brought her body back down to his cock hilt, then repeating himself over and over as he began to thrust deeply and strongly into his queen, the queen had never felt such pleasure in her life, she felt so full as his member stretched out her tunnel and pounded on her sealed cervix, and all she could do was moan an absolute pleasure as her body became used to this new fulness, the queen felt like she was floating away on a cloud of plesure, she never wanted this to end, she placed her hands either side of her maternal swell, now looking down as various faces and hands pressed out from her womb, and she only smiled, petting her belly&#39;s side before looking back up to Adam, she saw a look of live and devotion in his eyes, that of which the queen had only seen her father give to her mother, the queen before her.<br />
<br />
The Queen thoughts were interrupted however when Adam&#39;s member began to teitch as he trusted inside her, she wondered if he was OK, maby his body was reacting badly to the magic?, but she got her answers when Adam suddenly buried himself at the hilt and held onto the queen, she too held onto him as she then let out a scream of plesure as he erupted inside her, she could feel him, his warmth flowing deep into her, his body becoming one with her, but then he erupted again, and again and again, and all the queen could hope to do was hold on tight as her belly began to swell as his seed made its way through the barrier and into her womb, merging with the pink mist and began its transformation....</p>
