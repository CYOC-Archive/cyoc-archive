<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was sprawled at his desk, the glow of the Chronivac interface painting his face in shades of blue and white. He had just about convinced himself the program was an ingenious hoax when the door to the dorm creaked open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude,&quot; Mike said, tossing his bag onto his bed, &quot;Anything fun happen today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, you won&#39;t believe what I found,&quot; Jake replied, his voice a blend of excitement and disbelief. He swiveled the chair around, urging Mike to come closer. &quot;Check this out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike leaned in, looking at the screen skeptically. &quot;Chronivac? Is this some kind of game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorta... It says it can change things. People, even,&quot; Jake said with a half-smile, pointing at the bullet list of bizarre possibilities. &quot;I’ve been looking at this &#39;Occupation&#39; thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike raised an eyebrow, chuckling. &quot;So, what? You gonna turn me into the President of the United States?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, but we could go for something cooler. How about a motorcycle racer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike burst into laughter. &quot;Yeah, right. I bet it can&#39;t even change my socks, let alone make me a racer.&quot; Despite his words, Mike&#39;s eyes were gleaming with the adrenaline of just imagining it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is a &#39;motorcycle racer&#39; option,&quot; said Jake, his finger hovering over the command. &quot;Pretend it&#39;s real for a sec. Would you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The room brimmed with a strange, electric tension as the question hung in the air.<br />
<br />
Mike bit his lip, a mix of anticipation and incredulity dancing in his eyes. &quot;Sure, man, let&#39;s rev it up. I&#39;ll be like the hero from those anime you binge-watch. But with a bike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s click on the &#39;Motorcycle Racer&#39; option felt like flipping a forbidden switch. He looked at Mike, expectantly. Both were uncertain whether they wanted it to be a joke or a reality.<br />
<br />
A silent moment stretched between them. Then it happened.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s body began to shift right before their eyes. His stature grew; he became taller, his frame filling out with the pronounced muscles of someone who was accustomed to living close to the edge. Each breath he took seemed to morph his body more solidly into the role of an action hero.<br />
<br />
His clothing flickered, as if struggling between two realities, before melding into a sleek leather jacket, hugged tightly against his now-broadened chest. A pair of dark shades emerged, nestling on the bridge of his nose in a cool, effortless fashion. On his wrist, a high-tech watch blinked into existence, its display glowing with an array of symbols and numbers that promised the control of more horsepower than Mike had ever wielded.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s hair, once a simple and unremarkable style, became a rugged cascade of stylish locks that screamed &#39;rebel without a cause&#39;. His feet were suddenly adorned with a pair of sneakers that looked as if they were ripped straight from a futuristic concept art book.<br />
<br />
Both young men stared at each other—the creator and the created—in a breathless shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot; Jake began, his voice barely a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... look.&quot; Mike&#39;s amazement was clear as he turned his wrist to marvel at the watch. &quot;This is insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then, Jake&#39;s practical mind kicked in. &quot;Wait, Mike. If you&#39;re a racer, where&#39;s your bike? Your helmet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s breath came in shallow gasps as he stared at his now mechanized limb, his eyes tracing the indomitable sleekness of his new robotic form. &quot;Dude, this watch... there&#39;s gotta be something here about the bike.&quot;<br />
<br />
His fingers danced across the hi-tech display, revealing menus and options embedded within. Eager to unlock even more secrets of his asphalt-consumed destiny, his gaze skimmed through the matrix of choices. &quot;Invoke motorcycle,&quot; his voice hitched with hope, only to frown as the option remained obstinately greyed out. <br />
<br />
Next to it, however, the words &quot;invoke power-up&quot; glinted tempting and available. &quot;Maybe this does something cooler?&quot; He glanced up at Jake with a grin that belied the nerves beneath, and with a tap of confirmation, the world seemed to tilt on its axis.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s body contorted, twisting into a dramatic pose that would make any anime director proud. His feet lifted off the ground, toes pointing as the transformation cascaded up from the soles of his sneakers. Smooth metal plates locked in place along his lower limbs, jets and vents appearing and emitting a soft whir of unknown energy. His legs became pillars of cutting-edge technology, motors humming in a symphony of potential speed.<br />
<br />
The alteration raced further along his body, reaching his torso. Here the metal synchronized with his flesh, expanding and contracting with a semblance of respiration. Vents erupted along his back, their structure hinting at a power core that could rival the reactors of a sci-fi battleship.<br />
<br />
His arms followed suit, sculpting themselves into muscular robotic appendages, the sleek metal exuding strength and precision; they seemed both an artist&#39;s dream and an engineer&#39;s masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation enveloped his head. Mike&#39;s features tensed as a helmet seamlessly formed around his skull, the shades he had been wearing flowing into a visor that gave a crimson glow of digital life. Rubber and metal intermingled, crafting what once was his face into an uncanny mechanical mask of his former self.<br />
<br />
As Mike&#39;s consciousness was digitized into software, he felt a moment&#39;s darkness, a brief blackout before rebooting into an expanse of nothingness. The void gradually filled with bits of external sensory information, painting a world that assembled piece by piece with the rhythmic sounds of systems coming online.<br />
<br />
His voice, when it emerged, carried an alloyed edge, dripping with the tones of a programmed protector. &quot;Systems operational. Pose complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was now enveloped in a shell that bore hues of cobalt blue and emerald green, the sheen of his chassis catching light with a brandish of defiance. Sponsor logos were emblazoned across his metallic anatomy, each a testament to a corporate benefactor of this cybernetic age.<br />
<br />
Mike stood there, sans motorcycle, but with the knowledge ingrained into his core programming: he knew exactly how to procure the bike meant for a being such as he—a racer&#39;s steed, a whisper of speed incarnate.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes widened, a mixture of wonder and an odd thrill surging through him as he watched his friend, now a cybernetic marvel, stand before him. The sleek robotic lines of Mike&#39;s new body captured Jake&#39;s imagination in a way he hadn&#39;t anticipated, the raw power and technological perfection drawing him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, are you... are you actually a robot now?&quot; Jake&#39;s voice was a mix of amazement and curiosity, an undercurrent of excitement threading through his words.<br />
<br />
A whir of servos accompanied Mike&#39;s nod, his visor reflecting the room&#39;s light with an eerie glow. &quot;Affirmative, Jake. I am a robotic entity. However, my consciousness remains intact. I am still Mike on a fundamental level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake swallowed hard, taking a step closer. &quot;Can I... can I touch you?&quot; he asked hesitantly, a sudden heat blooming in his cheeks at the request.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s robotic gaze appraised Jake for a moment before he responded. &quot;There is no logical reason to deny such a request. You are my friend, Jake. Proceed.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jake reached out, his hand hesitantly trembling before making contact, he felt the cool hardness of metal under his fingertips. The touch was less discreet than he&#39;d expected; he could sense the intricate textures of Mike&#39;s new chassis and the vibrating hum of machinery that lay beneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels so... real, yet unreal,&quot; Jake murmured, his voice laced with a combination of disbelief and fascination.<br />
<br />
Mike nodded again, the mechanics of his neck emitting soft mechanical clicks. &quot;I am real, Jake. However, in this form, adopting a demeanor congruent with a robot may be... suitable.&quot; His voice modulated to a softer tone, almost mimicking his previous human inflection. &quot;But look, I can still talk and act like I used to. Ya know, before becoming a high-tech hero from the future,&quot; he said, his attempt at a reassuring smile now a fixed, rubber semblance of the gesture.<br />
<br />
Jake drew back slightly, in awe at the display. &quot;It&#39;s crazy... you&#39;re like two sides of the same coin now—Mike the college student and Mike the... the robot racer dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Mike replied, his voice carrying a trace of warmth. &quot;The range of human emotion and interaction remains at my disposal, but with enhanced capabilities. It&#39;s an... interesting dichotomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stood still, the blue and green lights pulsing rhythmically along his body, reflecting his calm yet assertive presence—a sentient machine that knew both the beat of a human heart and the binary rhythm of code.</p>
