<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was intolerable.  Dan had  been a good boy, he'd done well in school and, as Kate herself said, he was caring.  Now he was going to spend the rest of his life as cow because she resented him?  She said he picked on her but he had no memory of that, he didn't get her presents, but she didn't get him presents, it was an unspoken agreement.<br />
<br />
She was rubbing it in too, waving the wand in front of him discussing what she might do with him.  No, what she was going to do to her.  Dan wasn't a he anymore.  That was something she would have to get used to considering her sister was talking about impregnating her.<br />
<br />
God!  What had he done to deserve this?  He hadn't been the best big brother but ... wait a minute, when he came home he thought he was her little brother.  Since she called him big brother he remembered that he was the older sibling, but that morning he was convinced he was a sixteen year old.  She must have used magic on him before he even stepped through the door.  That bitch!<br />
<br />
If Dan was her big brother that meant- Dan grabbed the wand in her mouth.  &quot;You shouldn't have reminded me I'm your big brother,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
Kate was not happy, &quot;Give that back, right now,&quot; she ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not in a position to make demands, wandless wonder,&quot; Dan thought.  She was already making preparations, and clearing her mind of Kat's influence.  She was glad that the first thing she had done was disable that infernal collar, otherwise she'd have been compelled to give the wand back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it back or I'll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you'll what, _Kat_?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me that!  I hate that name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  Why else would you make me think of you as 'Kate'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat was through talking, she was going to walk over there, grab the wand, and turn Dan into a slime mold.  Something that could never grab her wand.  It seemed like a good plan until she found that her feet couldn't move.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not nice, Kat.  You've been much meaner to me than I ever was to you, and I'm not going to change you into a slime mold.  You're going to stay right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  You can't do that!  You're not-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not what?  Not a female member of the family over the age of 18?  I think you're well aware of just how female I am.  You stuck your hand in.&quot;  Dan rapidly changed into a 19 year old human girl.  She was attractive, but her clothing was conservative.  Dan poked one of her breasts, and liked the feel of it.  She could certainly live like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Dan said, and then paused a moment.  She felt her throat and smiled.  &quot;It's nice to be able to speak again.  Now, your first mistake was being an ass.  If you thought I wasn't doing my job as big brother you could have said something.  Instead you made me think I was your little brother.  What was the point in that, by the way?”  Kat just glared at her.  &quot;Your second mistake was turning me into a cow.  You could have turned me into anything, but you turned me female.  That made me into a witch too.  Your third mistake was not ordering me to leave your wand alone.  Your final mistake was reminding me I was your big brother.  Until you said that I thought I was sixteen, two years away from being a witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is what's going to happen.  I've made it so you can't change me, in body or mind.  You can't try to trick me, you can't try to hurt me, you can't make anyone else do any of those things.  You can't even suggest such a thing or take any action that you think will lead to such a thing.  You can't move against me in any way.  I might of thought these measures were excessive were it not for the fact you were discussing having me raped by a bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you've noticed, you can't move your feet.  You just stand there while I get mom and dad.  I'll let them decide what to do with you.&quot;</p>
