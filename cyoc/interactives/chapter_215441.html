<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You have to…” you shouted at the top of your lungs.<br />
<br />
“Ssssstop!”<br />
<br />
You heard the alligator’s deep, raspy voice yelling out to stop, only to realize that the alligator was still jogging back to the store, mouth closed.  It wasn’t its voice, you realized, it was your own.  The cowgirl was staring straight at you, Alli’goggles still pressed up against her eyes.  <br />
<br />
You didn’t have time to fully process what had just happened as you felt a tremendous pressure in your lower stomach.  It felt like something massive was inside of you, pressing out against the back of your skin.  Then there was the pain.<br />
<br />
Every muscle from your thigh to your abdomen suddenly contracted with an immense, painful force.  As muscles pulled against themselves, you could feel the cold floor tile pressing up against your long thick tail, only to feel the tile running up the bottom of your tail as your body forced itself down into a squatting position.<br />
<br />
You instinctively tried to pull the Moo’noculars down, only to feel them slam into the top of your muzzle.  Tossing to them to side, you found the bottom quarter of your vision filled with green tube that seem to stick out in front of your face, with two small bumps at the end.  There was another surge of pressure in your abdomen, and you took a deep breath, only to see those two bumps widen a bit – all while you could feel air passing into them.<br />
<br />
That was it, you could FEEL the cool air rushing into those bumps in the front of your vision, feel it passing through the top of your muzzle, then rushing down your throat to your lungs.  Your tongue raced about your mouth, and just like with your new nostrils, you could feel the bottom of that green tube sticking out in front of you, then you felt the fangs.  <br />
<br />
Unlike before, when your mouth had a mixture of different teeth, from incisors to molars, now all you could feel were thick, sharp fangs.  And there were a lot of them.<br />
<br />
Your tail thrashed about behind you as the muscles in your stomach painfully pressed down on something solid inside of you.  Looking down, you saw your belly, covered in the same creamy white scales as the alligator outside.  But unlike that other alligator, your stomach was bulging out in front of you.<br />
<br />
“Nrgg… what…” you cried out as another wave of force shot through your stomach, all as you felt the flesh between your hips begin to stretch as something pressed down into it.<br />
<br />
You looked up at Stan, confusion evidence in your eyes, as you took deep, labored breaths while your body fought against the object inside of you.  But where you had expected to see concern, you instead saw a look of embarrassment on Stan’s face.<br />
<br />
“Boss,” he sighed, rubbing his eyes with a thick, hoof-tipped hand, “can’t you wait until we get back to the farm?  You shouldn’t be squatting down here like that.”<br />
<br />
“Nrggg…” you cried as the object pressed further into your hips, only to hear the clerk laughing from behind the counter next to you.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry, my bull friend!” the clerk exclaimed as he searched under the counter.<br />
<br />
The clerk stood up, placing an alligator-skin lampshade on the counter, and continued, “She looks like she a real champion squatter, and I don’t mind if she lays here.  Besides, she looks like she’s having a bit of difficulty, I wouldn’t want her to end up as like this one did.”<br />
<br />
What did the clerk mean she?  And lays?  You weren’t laying down, you were squat-<br />
<br />
“Nrgghh!” <br />
<br />
Every muscle in your abdomen squeezed down around the object inside of you, forcing a blunt wide tip down into the center of your hips.  You could even feel some of the muscles twisting in on themselves as they slipped over the object’s smooth surface.  <br />
<br />
“Girls,” Stan looked at the cowgirl and alligator standing in the doorway, “could you uh, help the Boss with her female issues.”<br />
<br />
Stan moved away, rubbing his massive balls and pretending to browse some of the store’s items, all while he tried to pretend not to be embarrassed by the situation that was developing next to the counter.  But while Stan moved away, the cowgirl and alligator rushed over to you.<br />
<br />
The cowgirl position herself in front of you, a big smile on her face as she kneeled down, letting her udder splay out on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh,” she said as she pat her stomach, “the baby gets a little feisty when I kneel down too quick.”<br />
<br />
Then she looked up at you, “don’t worry Master, Matty will get you.”<br />
<br />
It was then that the alligator stepped behind you, squatting down and pressing into your back.  It was when you felt her tail press down on top of your own that you realized you had been instinctively thrashing your tail back and forth, but the soft scales and heavy weight of the alligator’s tail pressing down onto your own was strangely relaxing, as was the feeling of her soft belly scales pressing into the hard ridges that ran down the sides of your spine.<br />
<br />
She reached both arms around your stomach, then applied a gentle pressure to the top of it.<br />
<br />
“Here Masssster,” she said in that same raspy voice, “Jussst push.”<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes as another wave of pressure ran through your belly, and with the added force provided by the alligator’s hands, you could feel a hole begin to widen between your legs as something blunt, smooth, and - most distressingly - large, began to push out of it.<br />
<br />
“Arrrhhhhhh!” you cried out as the cowgirl shook her head at you.<br />
<br />
“Master, I told you we shouldn’t go out before you laid today!”<br />
<br />
“Massster didn’t think sssshe would lay until later.  Sssshe normally lays after dinner!” the alligator interjected from behind you.<br />
<br />
“Yes but she’s been laying earlier this week, she should have waited!”<br />
<br />
“Aghhhhrr!” you cried.  It was impossible to follow the conversation when you had no idea what they talking about.  Laying?  Dinner?  Besides, right now you had more important things on your mind, like the fact that it felt like the flesh between your legs and tail was about to be torn apart by whatever it was that was being forced out of you.<br />
<br />
Another wave of pain and more muscles squeezed down, all for you to be rewarded with the feeling of yourself being stretched painfully wider and wider by the object coming down.<br />
<br />
“One more.” The alligator whispered into your ear, all while her hands applied more force to the top of your stomach.<br />
<br />
You didn’t need to be told.  Or, rather, it was more accurate to say you didn’t have a choice.  You had no idea what was going on right now, and you were a completely passive participant as your strained and struggled all on its own.  <br />
<br />
One last, deep breath, one last push, and then there was a sudden feeling of release as a loud *clack* rang out from the floor below you and the feeling of pressure vanished.<br />
<br />
“Good job Master!” the cowgirl exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Stan, for his part, looked over and just said, “can we go back to the farm now, Boss?”<br />
<br />
The alligator patted you on the belly and rubbed her tail gently over your own.  Panting, you looked down between your legs and saw an oblong, white speckled object sitting on the ground below you, between two green, clawed feet.  Surrounding it was a pool of thick, mucusy liquid.  And from the feeling of cold that penetrated just slightly inside of you, you realized that more was slowly dripping down from the still gaping hole between your legs.<br />
<br />
Then it hit you.  That was an egg sitting between those feet – between YOUR feet.  That was the thing you had spent the last few minutes struggling to push out of your body.  That meant it was YOUR egg.  <br />
<br />
The realization began to hit you.  Just as you had turned the other customer into a cowgirl with the Moo’noculars, he had turned you into an alligator woman with the Alli’goggles.  You were just thankful that you looked at him first, since the cowgirl viewed you as the master and not the other way around.<br />
<br />
All that being said, you had no idea what to do in the situation.  While the others clearly had the memories of their ‘new’ forms, you remembered nothing of this new body’s life.  All you could do was squat and pant, when you heard Stan call out:<br />
<br />
“Come on girls, grab the egg and the binoculars, we need to get back to the farm.”<br />
<br />
The cowgirl – whose name you still didn’t know – slowly stood up, one hand rubbing her belly while the other supported the bottom of her udder, before she carefully leaned over and picked up the egg and both sets of binoculars.<br />
<br />
Matty, for her part, pressed her arms up into the bottom of your arm pits, helping to lift you to your feet.  You still had so many questions for the clerk, but you were exhausted from laying the egg, not to mention stupefied by the entire experience, so you didn’t protest as Matty gently pressed into you, causing you to walk out to your car while your tail dragged across the ground.<br />
<br />
It was a strange thought at a time like this, but you couldn’t help but notice how thick and heavy your tail was.  You tried lifting it, but while you did have some ability to wiggle it side to side, lifting it was just something you weren’t able to do.<br />
<br />
“Come on Master!” Stan said from the driver’s side door of the car, “Bengy and the other girls haven’t been milked today.”</p>
