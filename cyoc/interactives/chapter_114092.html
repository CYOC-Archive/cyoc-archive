<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two subjects lead you to their college campus, and told you which areas were dorms. &quot;Thank you, also don&#39;t worry about public sex, if anyone asks just point them towards me.&quot; You said. The two dragons looked at each other awkwardly, and then back to you. &quot;We find it kind of weird that we&#39;re supposed to mate almost immediately after I became female, Lady Flarine. Not that we aren&#39;t refusing to we just need to adapt a little bit first.&quot; The new female dragon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nonsense, you two seem to have good reasons, what are your names? I suggest the female give herself a new name.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;My name.... Diane....I guess now, and that&#39;s Daniel, or Dan which is what most people call him. Why do you ask?&quot; The female dragon, Diane said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no reason you two seem like the type of mortals that I enjoy to be around. I just want to give you a tad bit of motivation, don&#39;t worry this isn&#39;t anything bad for you, just move to the ally I don&#39;t want to step on you now.&quot; You said, and Dan and Diane responded accordingly, and you held your palm to them and a mist came from it.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately after Dan suddenly got extremely horny, and Diane went into heat and was extremely fertile. &quot;Perfect now while you two fuck each other, please know that I expect 3-4 egg clutches, which means you will fuck 3-4 times. Stay here while I give motivation to your campus.&quot; You said while the dragons were sitting there, Dan practically jerking off, and Diane sticking her tail into her pussy, and the second you left you could hear their roars.<br />
<br />
You turned to the campus, and took a deep breath letting loose a purple gas from your mouth, and the next thing you heard was the roaring of humans being transformed into dragons. &quot;Attention local college campus, I assume you know who I am, and I am giving you 5 minutes to pair up with either a caring male, or a thoughtful female that you wish to be mates with. After you do go to the courtyard, and wait for your next task, if you can&#39;t find anyone just come to the courtyard immediately.&quot; You announced to the college of newly transformed dragons.<br />
<br />
You watched as dragons began pouring out into the courtyard before you, and all of them got into a bowing position. &quot;It&#39;s good to see loyal subjects, but I have a task for everyone here that you will love. Firstly though, all teachers go back inside, and listen through the windows. Second paired couples split into two halves based on where I am so that half of you are on one side, and half on the other, and for my sake stay with your lover when you do.&quot; You said, and watched as everyone responded, and obeyed your every word. &quot;Good now, dorm assignments don&#39;t matter those to my left follow your male lovers to their room, and open the windows, those to my right do the same but follow the female lover. Those who don&#39;t have a lover remain outside. Everyone remain in those areas until I say otherwise.&quot;You said, and watched the dragons carefully as they began following each other to their dorms, there was a small number of about 9 people left 3 males, 6 females.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd number huh, oh well do any of you have a room to yourself? If you do sit down.&quot; You said, and one male sat down. &quot;Perfect, now the rest of you pair with another of the same gender, and I hope the person you pair with share a room.&quot; You said, and watched as the remaining males, and females paired with each other. &quot;I will explain why I do this afterward, but I only ask the one just to sit back, and try not to be stepped on.&quot; You said, and you snapped your right claw, and the one person of each group changed gender to the opposite of what they were. The dragons that changed gender began freaking out, especially the ones who were female before,&quot;Stop freaking out!&quot; You roared, and the newly changed male dragons stopped, and looked at you. &quot;I did this this way, because I don&#39;t approve of changing every beings gender just to balance things out, and now since you paired with a roommate, or I wish you did you know them better then any male, now just as before go to your dorms, and open the windows. Teachers get outside now, and as for you, you get to assist the teachers.&quot; You said looking at the one who was sitting down.<br />
<br />
The teacher walked outside, and sat down beside the one student who was left out,&quot;Now, I assume since you know about me you know what I represent correct?&quot; You said, and the teachers and student nodded,&quot;Good, now since this one doesn&#39;t have a lover then he can assist you with delivering assignments to those who do, and if you don&#39;t know about me then just know that what I&#39;m about to do isn&#39;t fatal, nor will it harm any of your students. I just need you to do your jobs, and teach your students, and make sure they learn even if they are focused on mating. On top of that there were two subjects that should receive praise for showing me here, and are currently mating in an ally where I told them to do so. Also please note one of them was previously male.&quot; You said,&quot;Now then, Those in their dorms don&#39;t panic, the gas I&#39;m about to release is not fatal, it just effects your bodies, and isn&#39;t toxic. Just follow your instincts, and you will be on the path to your new lives.&quot; You announced then began releasing your gas into the male dorm, and mad sure you got every room, and soon after you did the same thing to the female dorms. &quot;You feel the lust to mate, to fuck your lover don&#39;t you? Those feelings will only grow until you do, and you will create, and hatch 3-4 egg clutches, before you can exit your dorms, that is if your the mother. The fathers will have to get food, and water for your mates like your instincts tell you to, your teachers will give you your assignments at your dorms.&quot; You said, and suddenly the air filled with the noises of mating, roaring, and orgasm from the dragons climaxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other two students said they were roommates, so I suggest you help them to their room. As I said one was female, and for the lonely one with no lover I envy you so take this as a gift.&quot; You said, and blew a puff of gas into a cloud, and the lonely dragon became anthropomorphic, and he watched as his penises extended to 1 foot long, and he grew a vagina, and breasts that were DD cups, and gained the body structure of a woman. &quot;Now you have better odds, and consider yourself ascendant, and higher then your fellow students. I request that teachers cancel classes for today at least, and you may all enjoy your bodies however you like.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
Not even two minutes after Diane, and Dan came along,&quot;The two who lead me here return, I suggest you identify yourselves, and then go to your dorm room.&quot; You said, and you watched as the two dragons had a conversation with the teachers, you also noticed that Diane had a swollen stomach, and breasts. &quot;I see I should have directed you with the rest Diane, dragon eggs for humans seem to develop faster than expected, you seem considerably pregnant in both gut, and breasts. You are probably going to start laying eggs in a couple hours at this rate. Not to worry though, unlike mammals egg laying gets pleasurable after the first two, and isn&#39;t nearly as messy. The most to clean is the eggshells after your children hatch.&quot; You said, and the couple had a worried look. &quot;I assume your room is the one room with the closed window, I suggest you get there quickly.&quot; You said, and Dan, and Diane nodded, and began rushing to their dorm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was decently tiring, but at the same time I did just mate with Pyranine.&quot; You said sitting down in the street to the campus. Just then your ascendant ran up to you, and had a question,&quot;What&#39;s wrong my ascendant? Also what is your name?&quot; You asked, repositioning yourself to lay down across the street.&quot;Well, my name is John, I guess, anyways I was just wondering what your plan is to do? Why are you having is breed? Also just on a personal level, should I change my name? My voice is feminine now.&quot; The dragon-ess ascendant asked. &quot;Well, I humanity, and how their intellect combined with their brutality, I knew that the race would end soon within the next couple millenniums maybe, just a rough estimate. About your name however, you are a hermaphrodite now if your voice sounds too feminine to you then who am I to say you shouldn&#39;t change it? Personally I wouldn&#39;t change it unless you like playing female during intercourse. Also you&#39;re special, and you have potential of bearing my child. By that I mean that since you&#39;re ascendant you may either conceive to, or bear a child in my name. I have a spell that allows it, but you need to prove yourself first, besides you have another millennium at least before you expire naturally, and I am already pregnant with a clutch of my own.&quot; You said. &quot;Wait, there&#39;s going to be giant god/goddesses like you running around here? That&#39;s cute, but wouldn&#39;t it be destructive?&quot; John asked, and you sighed. &quot;Seems my knowledge here is limited as always. My eggs with Pyranine don&#39;t become offspring children like yours would. Instead our eggs when hatched bless all males to conceive a larger clutch 5 times larger than normal, and every male and female will be sent into lustrous fucking, until 2 clutches have been layed. On top of that all the children from those clutches are ascendant, and you are even more special. When my eggs hatch you may either become pregnant with a clutch of 10 times the size, and give birth to eggs of all ascendant eggs that will be self sufficient, and won&#39;t need to be warmed; However you may also have a chance to be pregnant with my children, and blessed with a fraction of my magic too so you could do what I do, like an apprentice of mine, of course your mate will be notified when you get one. Your male part will also get the power to conceive ascendant children with a 10 times bigger clutch of you choose to do so.&quot; You explained,&quot;also if you do get pregnant with my clutch that fraction is rather large, I won&#39;t be scathed by it, but you will gain one fourth of my strength in magic permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all so much to take in.&quot; John said gently squeezing hir left boob. &quot;I know what you need, and it&#39;s not that college. You need a mate, between my explanation, and your new additions that&#39;s all you really need is to settle down.&quot; You said. &quot;But what about college? My education, and possible careers in my life.&quot; John said. &quot;Honey, you are an anthro dragoness herm, who is an ascendant among my subjects. If you could find an occupation it would be among my subjects, and you already meet the requirements for the highest honor of being ascendant. Now I suggest you gather your belongings, apart from clothing, and notify your teachers of your departure, and say what I just told you. We are going to find you a mate, and you two will settle down in the area I decide for you. You still need to be able to work for me, unless you&#39;re pregnant, and/or caring for eggs. Also the best part is that you can choose male, or female, and I placed a symbol on your head that makes you ascendant. I will speak to whoever you choose, and see if they are committed to you, and me for they will probably take over in your absence.&quot; You said, and John paused holding hir erect members, and reaching for hir vagina, but then nodded happily.</p>
