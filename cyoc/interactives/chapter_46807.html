<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Denise Healy knew that somewhere out in the real world it was nearly one in the morning, but he really didn't care.  He didn't feel like he needed to go to the bathroom, and he'd had dinner only a few short hours earlier.  It had been an interesting and eventful day, and he couldn't help but think back on the fun he'd had so far.</p>

<p>His adventure in Prince Herald's Unfinished Kingdom could have gone very different had certain things not fallen into place or if he'd made other choices along the way.  As it was, Stephanie Mary Louis was a very interesting girl, and she moved with a style and grace that he very much enjoyed.  Her innocent look was tempered by Denise's want to cause as much trouble as possible… and, so far, he hadn't done that much damage.</p>

<p>The Lion-man Kenneth Baker had given him a few thoughts on authorities and the results of death, partly because Denise had already killed the man three times by now.  Otherwise, there was a fight with a giant crocodile in the sewer systems, followed by a painful trip to the hospital.  Painful, but fun… Denis had a huge respect for who and what Stephanie was, and couldn't think of playing another character any times soon.</p>

<p>Amy, his little sister, might think that him playing as a girl was funny, but she would never say so.  The ten-year old would never think to stand up to her younger brother.  His older brother, Richard, might find Stephanie an attractive young anthropomorphic skunk girl.  He had been an artist before Denise had him framed and gone away to Yasbeck and often drew anthropomorphic animals.  Oh, the joke would be supreme if Denise could lead Richard on as a female, only to reveal he'd had the hots for his younger brother all along.</p>

<p>And speaking of having the hots… while Derrick Bolo was an interesting fellow skunk, Denise hadn't taken into account what a feeling being turned into part machine would be.  Somewhere in the real world he had become hard at the sight of himself being cut open and his organs replaced with machine parts.  Stephanie had enjoyed it along with him, and her wetness was confusing to him on more than one level since his state didn't have an early sex education nor had he yet looked up anything about it on the internet.</p>

<p>For almost ten hours he'd been playing PHUK (not including stopping for dinner) and as he moved Stephanie down the stairwell outside Derrick's shop and onto the first floor, he spotted a group of young me who were all picking on shoppers as they went by.  They looked like a gang as they wore black and green shirts, bandanas, hats, or some combination there-of.  He smirked as he thought it to be unwise to try and start trouble in the Black Market District.</p>

<p>"Hey, isn't that the girl that killed that Lion twit earlier?" Stephanie heard from behind her as she stepped up to the glass front of NewGenes.  The front of the building was almost all glass with metal braces between the glass panels.  A central double-doors that had the shop's logo across it swung open as a young woman with green hair and emerald eyes stepped outside.  She wore a purple jumpsuit with a yellow tube-top over the top of it, and gave Stephanie only a parting glance as she walked out and into the District.</p>

<p>Stephanie smiled, thinking about the yellow tube-top as she was glad to have finally gotten rid of the chafing of her clothing only minutes before by removing her bathing suit.  She glanced back at the boys who were now approaching her and considered for a moment that her weapons were still out in her duffle bag in the alleyway next to the hospital.  Frowning, she asked, "Can I help you?"</p>

<p>The young man in the front, looking to be no older than eighteen, smiled and took off his baseball cap, "I was gunna ask the same thing, miss.  You lost?  This is the Black Market… if you're looking for handbags, that's a few halls over."</p>

<p>She sighed, "Trying to level up.  Unless you all want to be dead, I recommend you back away," she said as they continued to get closer.  When the six boys were standing all around her a moment later, she couldn't help but roll her eyes.  "Warned you," she said kneeled down for a moment, jumping up in a spin with both her arms out, the serrated blades of her claws extended out to four inches in length and ripped through the boys clothing and into their bodies, blood flying up and everywhere in a spray.</p>

<p>"She's a cyborg!" one of them yelled as he tried to turn and run, but Stephanie jumped up onto his back, her arm coming around his head and clawing out his throat.  She looked at the others and jumped at two of them, her claws ripping up into their stomachs, and momentarily lifting each of them off the ground by her claws.  A moment later, she threw them into the one man who was still standing.</p>

<p>As the boys crumpled into a bloody mess out in the Black Market, Stephanie turned and headed back towards the front doors of NewGenes.  She smiled, pushing open the front double doors, not noticing the blood that now covered her shirt and pants.  She looked around the front lobby and noted a young man and woman who were watching Stephanie closely with face that showed they had each seen what she had just done outside.</p>

<p>She smiled to them and gave a slight bow, her grin one of mild amusement.  Fixing her glasses, she stepped up to the metal front desk in the wide white and metal opening room with blue and yellow carpet and logos.  She smacked the service bell once, and waited on someone to show up as she stood at the front counter, looking around the room.  There were pictures up on the wall of famous people who had gotten alterations at NewGenes.  The man and woman were sitting on a long couch and each reading magazines that seemed to be fashion mags for genetics as the cover seemed to give away.</p>

<p>From the back room behind a red steel door appeared a woman who looked to be nearly seven foot tall, but was thin as a bean.  Her appearance was of an anthropomorphic cheetah, not wide at all, but very tall and almost all of her being legs.  She looked down at Stephanie as she put her hands on her hips, her chest out a bit revealing that beneath the black leather she wore, she had four more sets of breasts underneath her usual two D-cup, each almost descending a single letter at a time until they were only bumps with nipples (Stephanie assumed)</p>

<p>Nala smiled, and the spots coming up her arms and along the sides of her face all moved with an alien-like ripple.  Around her head she wore a mane of curly golden hair that looked not unlike Kenneth's.  Her leather outfit was opened along her back, and she wore long chaos leather boots up to her thighs, her crotch covered only by a leather thong.  Out the back, she had a cat tail that looked to be about twice as long as what it should be.  It flicked side to side as she narrowed her eyes a bit and asked, "Help you?"</p>

<p>"Bolo sent me.  I'm looking for Nala to get some 'New Gene'… as a Guildie," she added, thinking about it.</p>

<p>Nala blinked, and her sour mood left her a bit, as she looked Stephanie over.  "Derrick didn't say out new member was a female skunkette," she blinked, and then grinned.  "I guess I can give special treatment to a fellow anthro and friend of Derrick.  Do you know what it is you're looking for?"</p>

<p>"Well," Stephanie grinned.</p></p>
