<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane had never been poked and prodded as much as she had been in the past hour, multiple doctors all now in those large bulky biohazard gear. <br />
<br />
“How are you doing?” inquired a doctor who had taken some of Jane’s scales cutting away part of it with a scale leaving a bloody spot on her new tail.<br />
<br />
“Been better.” Said Jane her breathing heavy, she wasn’t in too much pain, they had hit that area with numbing agent. She had been having trouble breathing ever since she had transformed into a mermaid.<br />
<br />
“Still having trouble breathing?” inquired the doctor as a nurse, also in biohazard gear placed a wraparound where the scales had been cut away.<br />
<br />
“Yes and no, it is just the air is so dry, kind of reminds me when I went to Vegas.” admitted Jane “The air was so dry it hurt.”<br />
<br />
“When did you go to Vegas?” inquired the Doctor<br />
<br />
Jane thought for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Six or Seven years ago, for a friend’s wedding.” explained Jane <br />
<br />
“Alright, that likely has no effect on this, the others who are going through this are changing faster than that.” Stated the Doctor<br />
<br />
“How many others?” inquired Jane<br />
<br />
The Doctor paused and considered. <br />
<br />
“None are as far along as you and as far as we know you may still keep changing but there are now over 40 cases, most just have patches of scales but others have gone through physical changes.” Explained the doctor “Some have become physically younger, one by at least 20 years and one man has even become a women.”<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Jane as a new person entered.<br />
<br />
“Doctor we are ready.” Said the person as something Jane had never seen before was wheeled it. It looked like a sort of plastic coffin. Behind it came what looked like a portable overhead jack from the local car place. <br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s get ready to move her.” Said the doctor <br />
<br />
“Move…where am I going?” inquired Jane<br />
<br />
“Somewhere we believe will help you.” Said the doctor as the new man moved the overhead jack and all of them began to put straps around her before the jack lifted her off the bed. <br />
<br />
“Got a weight.” Said the man as he read out the number, it was over 70 pounds heavier than Jane had been when she got on the scale yesterday morning. <br />
<br />
“Alright lets put her in.” said the doctor, the box was tight and thanks to her tail Jane could hardly fit. She had to twist and turn and bend her new tail in what would have been impossible ways when she had legs but she fit. The box was closed, and she heard an electric motor as fresh air began to be blown in. <br />
<br />
The box was covered so she could see out but she felt herself being rolled out of the room and down a hall. Then a dropping feeling, she had to be in an elevator, before being rolled out again. The ride got bumping for a couple of minutes before becoming smooth again. <br />
Finally, the box was opened, and she sat up to find herself in of all places, the indoor pool of the local YMCA. The wet air felt so good as she looked around, the place was empty aside from some doctors still in biohazard gear and the man who had been working the lift also in biohazard gear.<br />
<br />
“Our testing of your DNA says you have traits similar to saltwater fish, so we had the pool filled with salt water.” Explained the doctor “We can monitor you and others here while we work on a cure.”<br />
<br />
“Alright…can I get a top or something?” inquired Jane, the hospital gown wasn’t going to be much help in the water. <br />
<br />
A nurse held up a simple green bikini top, which thanks to all the measuring they had done was now in a size to fit her larger bust. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Jane as she took the top before being lifted out of the box and into the water.<br />
<br />
Her heart rate was soaring as she was lowered but the moment her fin touched the water she felt a sense of relief come over her. As she was fully placed into the water it felt so good. She let out a sigh as she let herself drop down to the bottom of the pool. She didn’t even notice at first that she was still breathing, the saltwater going into her mouth and passing out of the outlets around her hips.<br />
<br />
She lied there on the bottom, just enjoying the water, her hair falling around her like a crown, before she sat up. <br />
<br />
“My god…I am breathing.” Said Jane as she heard her own voice under the water. “My God…I am talking under water.” <br />
<br />
She had to fight down panic, but slowly but surely she calmed herself down and took stock. She was breathing water as if it was air, somehow she was able to speak like normal. Even her hair acted normally instead of floating upwards. <br />
<br />
She got up, her tail brushing the bottom as she poked her head out of the water to see a group of doctors standing there.<br />
<br />
“Well…turns out I can breath under water now and even speak.” Stated Jane<br />
<br />
“Alright, we will monitor you but we need to go help others and run tests.” Stated a CDC doctor<br />
<br />
“Wait…can I get something to eat?” inquired Jane as she thought about it for a moment. “Maybe some fish?”<br />
<br />
“We will arrange it.” Confirmed a doctor as they left the now mermaid Jane alone in the massive pool.</p>
