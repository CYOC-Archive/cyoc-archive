<br/>
</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before humanity, before Elves and fairies, before civilizations and society, there were dragons. Majestic, near perfect beings with scales reminiscent of precious gemstones, yet being stronger than mithril. Their breath held dominion over the elements, including fire, lightning, frost, stone, and more. They were immortal, with no need for food, drink, or sleep. The only flaw of the dragons was their pride, as they believed themselves to be superior to all other life. In many ways they were right, and this pride was far from arrogance, at least in the beginning.<br />
<br />
As the mortal races began to populate the world, the dragons became revered by the rising kingdoms, and all was well at first. Different sects of dragons traveled to live with other races, one sect went to the fairies, absorbing their magic and joining their governments. A few joined a couple growing groups of druids, one group granted the ability to transform into plants, the other into beasts. Yet another founded a city of interbreeding known as Dracomo, creating the race of half-dragons, though few accepted them. <br />
<br />
Over time however, the dragons became envious, and their pride swelled. They felt entitled to the world, and its people. They REQUIRED their devotion, their obsession. The &quot;lesser&quot; races either had to worship the dragons or die. The Dragon King, Ferandor, called all of dragon kind to overthrow the human kings, and elven nobles. Most joined the war, though few refused. The dragons allied with the fairies, having grown gentle and kind due to their centuries of service (and their absorbed fairy magic) politely declined. The dragons of the now established Druid Circles of Flora and Fauna showed their fierce loyalty to the mortal races, refusing to serve. The half-dragons had no clue this war was coming. Dracomo had sealed itself away from the outside world in fear of the bigotry of other races, and all of the pure dragons had left. Even the few thousand that ventured out didn&#39;t know as they lived their lives as bakers, soldiers, carpenter, and more among the humanoid kingdoms. Ferandor declared them traitors and declared war. What followed was the bloodiest war to date. <br />
<br />
It waged on for over a century, castles being destroyed and rebuilt, armies decimated, and kings and queens were slaughtered. The humans, elves, orcs, dwarfs, and the allied half-dragons lost battle after battle, but never wavered in their resolve. The only dragon to fall was Ferandor himself before the final battle, assassinated in his sleep by an unknown assailant. This enraged the dragons, who vowed to not stop until all of the races were gone. The mortal kingdoms were in an uphill, losing battle, but surrender was not on their minds. For years they worked on a spell, one that would remove the pride from the dragons, and make them docile, before transmuting them from within, reducing them to no more than brittle, lifeless stone. They promised their allied dragons that they would be left unchanged by the spell, that they had no reason to fear. They gathered the best mages currently alive to cast this spell in their final push against the dragons. They concentrated as the battle raged on, but the lead Archimage, old and senile that he was, lost lucidity and focus, distorting and firing the spell before it was ready. At first it wasn&#39;t apparent to the humans what happened, other than the dragons being stunned for a few moments, until the dragons started attacking each other. The spell started removing their compassion, decency, and loyalty. In their place greed, gluttony, laziness, and lust slowly overcame them.<br />
<br />
The next few days were complete chaos. Over these days the spells effects would ramp up in strength, and both of the armies would learn the consequences. In the wake of the disorder, more lives were lost now than ever before, from both the war, and the growing infighting between the dragons.<br />
<br />
The dragons started hording gold, jewels, and heirlooms to sate their growing greed, but as the days passed, their greed grew, and they began to collect mundane objects, like kettles, tables, and even rubble. The dragons began fighting amongst themselves for each other&#39;s worthless junk. Each dragon felt the need to have more than anyone else, regardless of the value of their mounds of belongings.<br />
<br />
 Their gluttony induced pangs of hunger the immortal dragons had never know. At first the were able to calm it, consuming the food within the buildings of their enemies, but it grew to unnatural levels, making them shovel all they could find that was edible into their mouths, and even inedible stone, wood, and steel, but their metabolisms slowed, making their ever-hungry stomachs bloat with fat. Over time the dragons begin to enjoy their gorging, the feeling of food sliding down their throats endlessly, the sensation of their growing bodies, voluptuous with lard. And so they feasted. Their guts grew large, their cheeks grew plump, their arms grew soft, their thighs grew thick, and their asses grew rotund.<br />
<br />
 As days went by, the dragons felt a supernatural fatigue that no amount of rest or sleep could remedy. At first this was minor enough to ignore, a mere distraction from the battle and pillaging. But it began to weaken them, made flying harder, made breath attacks exhausting. They stopped fighting directly, then some of them stopped fighting entirely. Some of the dragons even fell asleep for the first time in their lives, make their laziness only stronger. Much like their gluttony, they started to love their acts of sloth, laying about while sleeping and feasting, their lack of activity contributing further to their expanding waistlines.<br />
<br />
 Some dragons needed to relieve their growing libido, forming huge orgy piles in desperation, but it wasn&#39;t enough. None of it was. As their minds transformed, so did their bodies. Their once gorgeous scales now resembled worthless stone, their claws and teeth became gnarled. Their breath became involuntary, as they expelled it thru belches and burps. The humanoid got what they wanted, but not the way they wanted it.<br />
<br />
But the dragon army weren&#39;t the only ones affected. All of dragon kind was affected.<br />
<br />
The magic within the fairy aligned dragons swelled and corrupted them from within. Their scales peeled off, revealing soft, squishy, orca-like skin. Their jagged features smoothed out, becoming softer. Their new flesh began to sweat profusely, as the days passed it became thicker, and stickier. It penetrated their bodies, turning their breath into mist. This goo had an aphrodisiac and a psychedelic effect, drenching one&#39;s mind in blissful, orgasmic memories, and the dragon, alongside their gluttony and laziness, were overcome with the urge to share their gift. These &quot;Slime Dragons&quot; were constantly high off their own slime, always in a daze, seeking perfect bliss in gorging, masturbation, and daydreaming. <br />
<br />
The druid dragon became consumed by their own magics. The fauna dragons became stuck in between dragon, and beast, some wild some domesticated their psychology a mix between mighty dragon, and lowly animal. Few survived long in their tortured minds. Those who survived became cult like shamans, divided into sects based off what beast they became. They were obsessed with converting the masses into their respective animals. The flora dragons became part berry, seeping infectious juice everywhere they go. They infect everything they touch, turning them into more &quot;berries&quot;, secreting their own juices, resembling blueberries, pears, peaches, and more.<br />
<br />
The half-dragons were both the least and most effected. The half- dragons within Dracomo were unaffected due to their ward, but all the half-dragons on the battlefield were instantly transformed. Their non-draconic half was burned away and provided nothing to compensate. They grew shorter, lost their genitals and wings, and become perfectly subservient to any dragon they laid eyes on, becoming the first kobolds. The dragons demanded food; the kobolds provided. The dragons tried to masturbate; the kobolds assisted. <br />
<br />
In the end the dragons left, too horny, too lazy, too hungry to fight anymore. With armies of kobolds in tow, they blocked themselves off the world to feast, sleep, horde, and fuck. Dragons have long since been forgotten since then, believed to be nothing more than myth. But they were no myth, and it about time they get rediscovered...</p>
