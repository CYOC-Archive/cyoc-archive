<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ring could teleport me. That in and of itself was both amazing and impossible. The things I could do with JUST the ability to teleport could easily make me one of the most powerful people on earth. Still, I wondered what else it could do. I made sure to lock my bedroom door. No one needed to know about my new find, and no one needed to witness the inconceivable happening, at least not until I knew the limits.<br />
<br />
Could it change objects?  “I wish I was wearing a red tank top.” The air seemed to waver around me; my vision lost focus for a second. Then everything went back to normal. I looked down, and saw that indeed, I was wearing a red tank top. I pulled a dollar bill out of my wallet. “I wish this dollar bill was a fifty dollar bill.” Again, my vision blurred, and when it returned, the dollar in my hand was now a fifty.<br />
In a word, this was amazing. I would literally never have to worry about money again.<br />
<br />
Could it create objects? “I wish there was a full bottle of Jack Daniel&#39;s whiskey on my desk.” Again, blurred vision, and again, moments later a bottle, looking store-fresh, was on my desk. I opened the bottle and took a long pull. The burn hit my throat perfectly. I could create food and drink. I would never worry about hunger or thirst.<br />
<br />
Could it change people? “I wish my eyes were blue.” My vision blurred much more severely this time, then corrected. I looked in the mirror on the back of my bedroom door. Instead of my deep brown eyes, they were a piercing blue. “I wish they were brown again.” Moments later, they were. It could change people, and it understood intent. I didn&#39;t have to say “eyes”..the ring wasn&#39;t a monkey&#39;s paw, eager to corrupt a wish. It wasn&#39;t some tool that needed absolute specifics. I simply said “they”, while meaning”my eyes”, and the wish affected what I wanted it to affect, in the way I wanted it to affect them.<br />
<br />
This ring appeared to have no limits. I would never have to worry about basic needs – nothing in regard to money, food, drink. I had essentially become a god. Admittedly, this raised questions about the woman who had given me the ring, and where the ring came from. I almost wished for that knowledge, but held off. Perhaps some things didn&#39;t need to be answered right away. There were other things that needed to be taken care of first.<br />
<br />
“I wish I lived in a mansion, on twenty acres of private land, which is all outright owned by me.” My vision blurred more severely, to the point I had to shut my eyes. My head was swimming. When I reopened them, I was in a bedroom that was far larger than I&#39;d been in before, decorated in dark wood, with a massive television on the wall, and a king-sized bed. <br />
<br />
I walked out of the door, and was greeted by a long hall with burnished brass doorknobs at a variety of rooms. Instantly, I knew what each room was. Up here were the bedrooms, along with a  study. My mind was filling in the blanks before I could even consider them, since I had “always” lived here. Still, it was impossible not to feel a sense of wonder. I descended a grand staircase that was inlaid with gold on the railings, down to the marbled first floor. I knew that I would find an amazingly well-equipped gym, private movie theatre, and impeccably appointed kitchen, along with two living rooms.<br />
<br />
I now had an estate, and privacy. My mind turned to darker things, deeper needs. I had yet to find the limits of the ring, and I wondered if there were any at all. I had one deeper wish, one that had fueled my darkest desires, and one that until today would have been impossible for me to achieve. I still didn&#39;t know for fact if it could be achieved, but I had to try. At this point, everything was simply wish fulfillment, and making self-insert fantasy real, and I was already hard as I started to form my words.<br />
<br />
“I wish that werewolves were real, and that I was the first werewolf in history. I wish that the transformation was always pleasurable, and that werewolves could transform any time in the absence of direct sunlight. I wish that I am the only male werewolf in the world right now. I wish that 75% of female werewolves were bisexual after being turned, with the remainder keeping their sexuality intact. I wish that lycanthropy can be transmitted sexually, biting, or even with a claw scratch. I wish that the transformed shape be like that from The Howling, with bipedal bodies mixed with lupine characteristics and increased muscle growth. I wish that in either form, werewolves exude a sexual magnetism for humans, with mine being the most powerful, and decreasing in strength, based on number of bites away from me any other werewolf is. And I wish that every werewolf that is now, or will ever be shall recognize me as the supreme alpha werewolf, submitting to my every direct command, no matter how base or against their will it might be.”<br />
<br />
I&#39;d kept my eyes shut as I wished, knowing that by changing both myself and the nature of the world as a whole, I&#39;d be risking a migraine by trying to keep them open. There seemed to be an almost tangible vibration in the air, and then it stopped. I opened my eyes, and knew that my wish had become reality. I could feel a power inside of myself, a restrained reservoir of strength. My body felt new to me, yet perfectly normal, as though I&#39;d always been this way. Even so, I still felt proportionally weak, because this wasn&#39;t my true form, not any more. I ached to experience the change for real, even as my mind insisted I&#39;d done it multiple times before now. <br />
<br />
As it had always been in my mind, the transformation was sexually charged, and the mere thought of it turned me on immensely. While I knew that I could stimulate myself, or wish for a sex toy to fuck while I changed, that wasn&#39;t nearly as appealing as the final wishes that popped into my mind. It wasn&#39;t just ME that I wanted changing, and it wasn&#39;t just one woman, either. “I wish that five women  lived here. I wish they were all in my direct pack, and all in a sexual relationship with each other and myself.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, smells assaulted my nostrils, as the scents of five women appeared seemingly out of nowhere. I could smell them individually, if I concentrated. My heightened hearing allowed me to detect the chatter coming from one of the living rooms, and I headed toward the sounds, eager to see them for the first time, even as my memories informed me I&#39;d known them for awhile.<br />
<br />
They were seated on the lengthy sectional sofas, lounging casually and sipping mimosas, watching some reality show and discussing who they&#39;d like to turn or kill. All of them wore nothing more than black silk robes (apparently due to our propensity for sex and transformation at any given point in time, as my mind informed me of recent memories once again). <br />
<br />
Their attention quickly turned to me when I entered the room. Their pupils dilated, and their nostrils flared momentarily. I could smell an increase of the wolf in their scents, subtle but noticeable, a sign of their attraction to me. <br />
<br />
“Hey babe,” said the one nearest to me, “Whatcha..” she trailed off as she stared at me, licking her lips as she inhaled more deeply, drinking my scent in with a concerted effort to do so. Her eyes met mine, and greeted them with barely-contained sexual hunger. “..whatcha thinking about..?” She adjusted her posture slightly, causing the robe to spread open just a bit, exposing her left breast and its erect nipple. Her mouth curved into a smirk, as she added, “oops..” but she didn&#39;t move to cover it up. I enjoyed the view, and didn&#39;t correct her as I joined her on the couch.</p>
