<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I wish Skylar’s lips would grow enough to make her mumble her words,” you whisper,<br />
<br />
Unluckily you couldn’t see Skylar’s face from where you were, so you just listen to her talking,<br />
<br />
“Mom, I’m kinda busy I don’t feel like having dinner tonight,”<br />
“Sky, you have to eat dinner,”<br />
“No, mom, I don’t have to eat evewy night,”<br />
You see Skylar’s mother raise an eyebrow, “What was that, Sky,” she is smirking at Skylar tripping over her words,<br />
“I said I down’t hafe to eat dinner evewy night,”<br />
“Sky is everything okay,” her mother was now full on smiling,<br />
“Yeah, it is,” Skylar says, she turns to look at the closet, right through the gap at you. You see her lips, they looked bigger, puffier. You almost had the urge to kiss her, but you don’t since you’re in a closet.<br />
<br />
“Sky, What are you looking at?” Her mother asked. Skylar snapped back and said,<br />
“Oh, Nothing, I just thought my phone went off,” she was talking better now, you couldn’t only imagine how much she had to move her mouth to make it work.<br />
<br />
“Well, if you’re not having dinner, you still have to sit with your sisters and I at the table. Your father-”<br />
“Mom can we talk about this later!” She says, <br />
“What else were you going to do, actually while you’re here I need to talk to you about school,”<br />
“Mom!” Skylar yells,<br />
“Nope, you’re not getting out of this one young lady,”<br />
<br />
“Hmm...” you say to yourself, trying to keep your voice down, “I wish that Skylar’s Mom has lips like Skylar,”<br />
<br />
You watch as her mom talks, she begins to mumble too, the gap between each lips is getting smaller as her lips get thicker.<br />
<br />
“Huh, looks like I’m mumbling too, Sky,” her mother said, she placed a finger on her lip and poked it, “that’s weird, whatever. As I was saying,”<br />
<br />
“What else... oh... that’s a great idea!” You say to yourself, “I wish Skylar gets thicker, like pudgier, especially in her thighs, hips and butt. Only she will notice though, and me obviously,”<br />
<br />
You watch Skylar zone out as her mother talks about her grades. She sounds pretty monotone, this must be a common talk for Skylar. You watch however as Skylar’s body starts getting thicker. Her arms are slowly but surely getting plump. They look more fat than the usual slim and slightly toned. You look at her waist, it’s usually nicely sized but as she stands there, it starts getting thicker. You can’t see her belly but you’d think it’s getting a little bigger. You pay close attention as you see her butt getting bigger. It’s beginning to sag from the weight. Her hips are getting wider too, and her thighs. The distinct gap between them, slowly disappearing as they thicken. Even her calves are getting thicker. You see her look down. She sees herself growing, getting thicker. Her face is shocked,<br />
<br />
“Sky, What is it? Are you even listening?”<br />
“Mom!” She yells, “can you not see this!?” She grabs her belly with two hands and lifts it up. From your angle you can see it. It’s nowhere as big as her butt or thighs but distinctly bigger than it was before. Her body was always slim and fit.<br />
“Yes, Sky. I know. You need to lose weight, I mean just look at that second chin you’ve got. It’s not a good role model for your sisters to grow up with.”<br />
“Mom! I wasn’t like this 30 seconds ago!” She yells, she turns to face the closet. You see her face deciding whether or not to charge over to the closet or not, she doesn’t. You see her belly is sticking out over her waistband. Her breasts looked a little bigger too, but that was just fat.<br />
“Sky! What has gotten into you. You sound crazy.”<br />
“I’m... I just... urgh!” She shouts,<br />
<br />
“Listen, Sky. I know you don’t like talking about your grades. The lord knows how I did in my exams, I just don’t want you to end up like me,”<br />
“End up like you!?” Skylar yells, “you have everything!”<br />
“Everything and a fat daughter!” Her mother yells, “Jesus. I need a break. Dinner will be on the table, and you WILL be eating it,” her mother looked her dead in the eyes and shut the door, you heard her walking down the hallway and reach the stairs.<br />
You see this opportunity and open the closet door. You see Skylar standing there, looking right at the door. Not moving.<br />
<br />
“Um... Skylar?” You say, trying not to be too loud,<br />
“Yeah. I know. I would totally kill you right now... but... I guess I just never noticed,”<br />
“Noticed what?”<br />
“How much of a bitch she is. I mean... I get what you did, you made me fat,” she says, her head is now facing down, “and I know I’m not actually fat, I mean you can fix this whenever you want. But as a fat girl, I guess I was always a fat girl. And she shouted at me, for being fat.”<br />
“Yeah... I saw... You know that’s how you treat me and my friends, right. You make fun of Emily for being a ‘dyke’ and Niko for being a fat pig, and me for-”<br />
“I know. I know. That’s what I mean,” she turns round to face you, not moving her head up though. You see her double chin as she faces you. She isn’t fat, but pudgy, chubby. She moves her face and locks eyes with you, “I didn’t realise how it felt. I know this sounds like I’m just saying this or something, but I mean it. I am sorry,”<br />
<br />
You are speechless. The last time you saw Skylar act was last years school play, she was horrible. She couldn’t act. Thank god they didn’t give her the main part. But she wasn’t acting there, and you knew it. She was being genuine. You didn’t have anything to say. You’d gotten almost everything you’d wanted from Skylar today, except maybe one thing.<br />
<br />
You move over to Skylar, looking her in the eyes, not breaking. You stand face to face with her. You move your face,<br />
<br />
You kiss her right on the lips.<br />
<br />
Her eyes go wide, before embracing it. She moves her arms around to your back and stays there. You kiss for another few seconds before parting. You look away from each other,<br />
<br />
“I made you in love with me,” you both say at exactly the same time,<br />
<br />
“What!?” You quickly say back.</p>
