<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...like dancing. I mean, you are a ballerina, it's only natural. You stand up, letting out a little yawn and stretch your limbs as you look at yourself in the mirror. The only thing that you need now is a place to dance; the changing room that you're in is a little bit cramped, even after you have been turned into your current form. The shop is unlikely to have a dance floor or stage, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check. <br />
<br />
You slide the curtain apart and marched towards the front desk of the costume shop to inquire about an area to dance in. You passed a myriad of other costumes, but you paid them no attention. You were quite content being an adorable ballerina. When you reached the front desk, you were surprised to find that the shopkeeper wasn't present. You circled the desk and found a sticky-note pasted on the side of the desk at about eye level for you. You peeled it off and read: "I had a feeling you would be needing this. Head through the backroom and take the second door on the left. Enjoy."<br />
<br />
You smiled a little at the thoughtfulness of the shopkeeper. Well, let's see what the surprise was. You open up the back room door and look around inside. There were a lot of boxes piled up on shelves and, sure enough, there were two doors on the left side of the room. You pranced over to the 2nd door and pulled it open. All you could see was a dark room with what appeared to be a large curtain hanging down in front of the far wall. It looked a bit spooky, but the shopkeeper did say what was in here was for you. Summoning the courage, you stepped into the room and pulled the door behind you shut.<br />
<br />
The room was a bit chilly and you wandered over to the side of the curtains to peer around them. As you were making your way around the wall, you hit your head on something attached to the wall, sending your wig slightly askew. Fixing it, you adjusted your eyes to the dimness to view a light switch. Fumbling around, you found the switch and flicked one of them. Some stage lights in the room you were in suddenly burst into illumination, causing you to cringe back and shield yourself from the brightness. You seemed to be in some sort of backstage of possibly a theatre stage. Which meant that behind these curtains was...<br />
<br />
As you gazed around the stage around you, you realized that you were now in the spotlight of the most massive dance stage you had ever seen. There were hundreds of seats spread out in array in front of you, with multitudes more filling the wings and making a second floor viewing area. There was even a third row and individual VIP seating areas! You imagined all the seats filled up to the brim, spectators anxiously waiting for your performance. And would you give it to them?<br />
<br />
And so you danced. You couldn't recall ever doing anything similar before, but it all felt natural. You led their attention as you leaped across the stage, pausing at the edge of the stage to do an arabesque. A pirouette here, a spin there, you even tried a jump.<br />
<br />
You laughed a bit as you fell into a heap, knowing that the people watching didn't mind. <br />
Except, apparently someone did mind...<br />
<br />
"HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE!" <br />
<br />
You spun around in fright as you saw a big man, probably a security guard run towards you from one of the aisles in between the seats.<br />
"How did you get in here!"<br />
<br />
You weren't sure why, but you knew that you didn't want to be caught by this man. Even as you thought that, you heard another man rummaging in the curtain behind you, looking to flank and apprehend you. Realizing you couldn't outrun these men, you started thinking of a way to outsmart them. <br />
<br />
You dashed back into the backstage area and flicked off the lights. You felt satisfied hearing the men yell in frustration. As you dashed back out of the curtain, you figured that your best chance to get away was to leave through the doors in the back of the seating area. You were running across the stage to jump down into the seats, when you heard the click of a flashlight turn on. It was turned towards the ceiling, but it quickly righted itself and started sweeping across the stage in your direction. You dropped to the ground, sliding across the ground and thumping onto the ground below in an ungraceful heap. Getting to your feet, you swiftly ran across the carpet to the exit doors when you saw your shadow sprawl out in front of you as a flashlight centered on your back.<br />
<br />
"THERE SHE IS!" <br />
<br />
You felt the adrenaline in you kick in as you burst through the doors and entered the hallway outside. It was very well lit and furnished decently well and in the similar red and gold of the stage room. Figuring you didn't have much time before the guard came through the door behind you, you dove behind a large potted plant and quickly tucked your dress out of sight. <br />
<br />
No sooner had you done that, when the double doors were bashed open and the two guards came out into the hallway.<br />
<br />
"Did she get away?!" one of the guards growled.<br />
"Only for a little while." the other one responded. You could see a cruel sneer on his face as you scanned both ends of the hallway as a well as a brief glance up and down the stairwells. <br />
"She couldn't have gone far. I'll check rooms this way and you go the other. After that, you check upstairs and I'll go down. I'll radio you when I'm done or found her."<br />
<br />
The two dashed down their separate ways. You figured that in order to escape you needed to go up or down the stairs as fast as possible. Who knew if more guards would check the stage, or if it was even safe to exit that way. Why had the shopkeeper told you to go here? You weren't set on her being genuine and decided not to go back to the costume shop. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to get tired going upstairs, you dashed down the stairs down one floor since the stairs terminated. It seemed to be some more backstage areas or maintenance. There were plenty of small places to hide behind, but you'd be exposed to any flashlight beams. You continued to dash down the halls, looking for some place to hide. With a sinking feeling in your stomach, you realized that you were on the bottom floor, nowhere else to run. You weren't sure if you had time to go back upstairs, so you went to the nearest room, determined to find a hiding place inside it. The lights were on inside, much like the rest of the complex. A plaque next to the door read 'Girl's Changing Room'.<br />
Your face broke into a relieved grin as you realized that there would be costumes inside the room, in other words, disguises. You hadn't met or seen any other people in the building, but that didn't mean that no one else was here. You could be simply another performer. <br />
<br />
You entered the room and looked around, face crestfallen as you saw them. Lockers. Rows of lockers were spread out in front of you, no costumes, no wigs, nothing. Maybe you could hide in one of the lockers, you nervously thought. You locked the door to the changing room and walked through the aisles of the lockers, pulling on handles, hoping to find one open. Not one was. You went through aisle after aisle, most lockers had padlocks and ones that didn't were empty. What's more, the lockers had holes that while not big enough to reach through, someone walking between could easily see inside, which meant hiding in a locker was out of the question. As you turned into the final row dejectedly, you almost fainted from fright as you saw a face peering back at you from one of the lockers. You jumped behind the row and nervously looked back at the other person. Strangely, their eyes didn't seem to register your presence. In fact, their entire face didn't move at all. Mincing forward, you felt relieved as you realized that that the face looking at you was only a mask. It seemed to be well made and had the face of a young girl, smiling kindly at you. She had large, warm, brown eyes and long blonde tresses that flowed freely. Two, tiny pigtails on the side of her head held a flower crown in place. It was , she was, sitting atop a duffel bag. Unzipping the bag revealed a rubber skinsuit to which the mask was attached to, a periwinkle ballerina costume, and matching panties. <br />
<br />
It hit you that this was the perfect disguise. With this doll mask covering your face, the guards will never be able to tell that it is you. You figure that you should dress as quickly as possible, that way you have more time to plan what you'll do next. Without wasting time, you begin to strip down and toss your previous ballerina costume into the bag and dumped the previous garments onto the floor. Standing quite naked, you began to slip the rubber suit up your body. The skin tone was a nice pink that contrasted slightly with your own pale figure. As you started pulling up the leg of the suit to your own, you noticed that it seemed to fit tightly to you, as if it were slightly too small. After placing both legs inside, you pulled it up past your crotch and started pulling up the arms to wear them. The suit seemed to hold tightly to you, a bit too tight in some areas, but you felt you could manage. I mean, it's not like you were going to be in the doll for long. Placing your fingers into the individual holes, you took note of the sheen the rubber gave off from the light, only accenting your thin arms. <br />
<br />
Zipping the suit up to the neck, you left the mask dangling in front of your face as you finished smoothing the rubber out, the hair on the mask tickling your rubber chest. As you looked down, you saw a noticeable difference in you breasts; they must be at least a C cup now! The suit must have padding in some areas. Looking down, you saw that your hips were now much wider and sloped down to the large thighs befitting a ballerina. Curious, you gave your breasts a quick jiggle before continuing on, satisfied with the way they moved. The zipper going down your back would be quite evident due to the open back nature of the leotard. Hopefully the mask's hair would cover it up. You were a bit curious as to why a doll skinsuit would just be lying in a locker, but now was not the time to question things. <br />
<br />
You entered the leotard through the back, the sheer material hugging your rubber body. It had a ruffle trim by your breasts, which were only barely covered. The rest of it clung to your waist, covering your crotch and leaving your lovely legs on display. A filmy tutu of the same color hung down to above your knees as you smoothed it out. Arm bangle sleeves that were nothing more than a ring of cloth were placed on your upper arms. <br />
<br />
As you reached to place the mask on your face, you suddenly heard the door to the changing room begin to jiggle, someone was here! The security guards must be here already! Wasting no time, you placed the doll mask over your own and slid it down to meet your eyes. A problem with the mask was that your head was too big for it. You fit into it tightly, which prevented your mouth from opening. The world was bathed in a light brown light as you aligned the doll's eyes with your own and you quickly yanked the zipper upwards, soon to be hidden away inside the blonde hair. <br />
<br />
However, the zipper got caught in the doll's hair at the top, and as you tugged on it fiercely up and down to free it, the zipper handle popped clean off! You were trapped in the ballerina doll!<br />
<br />
You heard the click of the door swing open from across the room. You only have a few seconds to do anything before they discover the ballerina doll in the last aisle. What do you do?</p>
