<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few blocks away from Mina, Georgie and Toni&#39;s flat, Doreen parked her car in front of Annie&#39;s house and honked. Doreen and Annie were two close friends of Bri, and Bri invited her two friends for a sleepover at her mansion.<br />
<br />
One minute later, Annie went outside, follower by her younger sister Clara. Annie apologized: &quot;Clara insisted to come with me. I didn&#39;t want to, but my parents forced me to phone Bri, and Bri said Clara could come with us. So we&#39;re stuck with the brat tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara protested: &quot;Dad told you to be nice with me !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am nice with you. I didn&#39;t tell Doreen what you were doing in the bathroom last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So shut up!&quot; concluded Annie.<br />
<br />
Annie sat on the front passager seat, and Clara at the back. Doreen then drove them to Bri&#39;s mansion. While they were driving, Clara stayed silent. She was a shy, petite girl. She was only 14 years-old, and seems like an ugly duckling compared to her sister. Her face was acne-ridden, she was slightly overweight and Doreen sympathize with the girl since she had the same problems. In fact, an outsider could think that Clara was Doreen&#39;s sister, not Annie&#39;s. Annie, on the other hand, was a very beautiful girl, and she was aware of this. She was confident, self-centered and very popular with the boys.<br />
<br />
Annie, who didn&#39;t like the silence, continued: &quot;My boyfriend phoned me before you arrived. He said he would exercise at the gym club all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what ?&quot; asked Doreen, who was single and never had a real boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s good to know he is busy when I am not with him. You would understand, if you had a boyfriend. And, I can picture him sweating while pumping iron. That&#39;s so sexy !&quot;<br />
<br />
Doreen didn&#39;t insist. She just shut up and tried to ignore how annoying Annie was when she was talking about her boyfriend. 10 minutes later, they arrived at Bri&#39;s mansion. Doreen&#39;s old and cheap car constrasted with the luxury of the place, something Annie immediatly pinpointed. &quot;At least I have a car and a driving licence&quot; answered Doreen. Doreen was in fact much poorer than Annie and Clara&#39;s family (to say nothing about Bri&#39;s family). She inherited the car, a small flatt and some money from her Dad when he passed away (her mother commited suicide when Doreen was very young). Doreen&#39;s father was until his death a respected teacher at their school , and he negociated the right for his daughter to attend this school without paying much of the tuition fee (that was the reason why Doreen could attend the most expensive school of the city).<br />
<br />
They were welcomed by one of the maids wearing a sexy outfit showing her impressive cleavage. The maid had unatural hair color: flashy orange, same color as her eyeliner, her lipstick and her long, manucured nails. Annie, Clara and Doreen smelt a rose scent, and it unlocked something in their mind.<br />
<br />
Clara had never been to Bri&#39;s home before. She said: &quot;I knew Bri&#39;s mothers were wealthy, but I didn&#39;t realised they were so wealthy. This mansion is so luxurious!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie had to say something: &quot;I went there with my boyfriend several times. He said they may be wealthy, but they taste is horrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, the mansion was decorated with many statues and paintings, depicting gorgeous women in lassive, if not outright erotic pose. There wasn&#39;t a single representation of a man anywhere. Given than Bri and her mothers were all openly lesbians, it wasn&#39;t surprising, but the general impression was that men were not welcomed in this mansion. Strangely, Doreen felt at home here, maybe because she went so many times to visit her friend Bri. <br />
<br />
Annie, Clara and Doreen followed the maid upstairs. The maid wasn&#39;t wearing a pantie under her miniskirt, as the three girls noticed. Annie act as if she didn&#39;t noticed. Clara blushed. Doreen, for some reason, was compelled to say: &quot;Nice ass!&quot; The maid smiled, but Doreen immediatly thought: &quot;Why did I say that ? This isn&#39;t me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it could be you&quot; said another voice in Doreen&#39;s mind. This voice sounded like Doreen&#39;s usual inner voice, only slightly deeper and more assertive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you came here. I am so excited!&quot; said Bri as she welcomed her friends in her bedroom. She was already wearing nothing but her pijama, which was barely concealing the voluptuous curves of her body. For some reason, Annie and Doreen knew their friend had somehow changed, but they couldn&#39;t quite put their finger on it.<br />
<br />
Doreen focused her mind, trying to remember the old Bri. Finally, she remembered a name and said out loud: &quot;John ! Your boyfriend&#39;s name is John! I remember this because he has the same name as your father! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doreen, my dear friend, I don&#39;t have and never had any boyfriend. You know I prefer girls, like my twin sister JJ. And I have no father, only two mothers: Joana and Marie.&quot; replied Bri as she kissed Doreen on the lips.<br />
<br />
Doreen like the kiss. Her lips became fuller, and turned crimson red. Doreen forgot her silly memories of Bri being anything else than a gorgeous lesbian, and questioned her own sexuality. Wasn&#39;t she at least bisexual, if not outright a lesbian ? And if boys were not attracted to her, why should she be attracted to boys ? She was certainly attracted to beautiful girls like Bri. Or Bri&#39;s twin sister Joana Junior (JJ). <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So you must be Clara. Nice to meet you !&quot; said Bri and she also kissed Clara on the lips. Clara blushed, and her lips turned purple.<br />
<br />
Annie protested &quot;Hey ! That&#39;s my little sister !&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be jealous&quot; Bri told Annie befroe kissing her on the lips. &quot;There is plenty of lesbian love for everybody&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a boyfriend ! I&#39;m not a dyke like you !&quot; shouted Annie but her lips turned crimson red on the left half, and purple on the right half.<br />
<br />
Bri appologized: &quot;It&#39;s just the way we causally greet other women, according to my religion. It&#39;s called the Sacred Kiss of Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doreen interceded: &quot;I am sure Bri meant no harm. It&#39;s just a kiss. It&#39;s not like Bri had stuck her tongue in Clara&#39;s wet pussy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to stick my tongue in Clara&#39;s wet pussy and fuck her little brain out. My little sister wouldn&#39;t mind if I fuck Clara right in front of her, she would rather join us&quot; said Doreen&#39;s other inner voice, and for a second Doreen feared other people could hear that voice too. And who was this little sister the voice was refering to ? Doreen never had siblings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bri said: &quot;I want to make amend anyways. You see those four statuettes ? They represent the pantheon of my religion.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were indeed four statuettes  in a corner of the bedroom. They represented 4 naked women of various size. The biggest one represented Martha, the Wild Maid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Standing on the shoulders of Matha, there was the statuette of Goddess Jen. And sitting on each hand of Martha, there were the two Holy Mothers Rita and Liza. The face of each of the four statuette were extatic, their mouth mide open, as if they were climaxing. All four statuettes were impressive works of art, they were golden-plated and were very expensive. <br />
<br />
Bri precised: &quot;I&#39;ll keep the statuette of the Goddess, but I&#39;ll give you each one of the three other statuettes. Annie, which one would you like ?&quot;</p>
