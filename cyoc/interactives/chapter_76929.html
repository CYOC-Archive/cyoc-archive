<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary Kate grabbed her bag and ran out of the cab, just as Tim and Vanessa had predicted, her skirt fluttering, <br />
right into the arms of...herself?<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there, honey. Were those two girls friends of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, Tim and Vanessa turned a right corner, and disappeared into the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no. They were vampires! At least one of them was. The other one, the younger one, put a spell on me and <br />
turned me into this here little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doppelganger chucked, and then rubbed the hair on top of Mary Kate's scalp.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You don't believe me?&quot; <br />
<br />
The former grown man couldn't believe how high pitched and whiny his voice sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, if I believed you, half the population of this town would either be the living undead, aliens, or <br />
demonically possessed wizards. Now c'mon, lets go home. I'm beat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Kate could attest to that. Staying in a car all day does kind of make you out of shape and easily tired. <br />
Going into the front side passengers door, she put on her seat belt and put her fingers through her hair. <br />
Never in her life had she kept it long like this.<br />
<br />
Why was she going with this man? Sure, he looked identical to him(or at least how he used to be), but for all <br />
she knew, he was another monster just waiting to ruin her day even further. Pulling the I.D card from the <br />
back, Mary Kate saw a picture of the man, and his basic information such as his height, age and when he first <br />
got his drivers licence. His name was Grant Shannon. Grant Shannon. That was her real name. Her real identity, <br />
somehow mentally blocked from her memory. That was who she was. <br />
<br />
So who was this identical stranger?<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't get my good side&quot; smiled Grant, suddenly closing the drivers side door behind him. <br />
<br />
Mary Kate smiled benignly. It was she who got this lousy picture taken, six months ago at the DMV. Not this <br />
impostor. But for now, all she could do was wait. She couldn't just run away or whatever. Not in this frail <br />
body.<br />
<br />
On the ride back home, Mary Kate(the real Grant) and Not-Grant talked about how Mary Kate did at school today, <br />
how her grades were doing, and other things like that. Not-Grant revealed himself as her father in an offhand <br />
comment. The guy didn't seem to have any clue what was really going on or that the real Grant Shannon didn't <br />
have a teenage daughter who went to St. Francis'. Or for that matter, that his little girl was really a man!<br />
<br />
When they did get back home, MK/Grant had to bite his tongue and not call his new mom(actually his wife) by <br />
her first name, and not to disparage her cooking. A burly man might have been able to get away with it, but <br />
Ashleigh did not take most critics lightly. Especially not kids who's palette wasn't developed yet. MK found <br />
her new room, which had previously been an office that he never used, become a more or less typical teenage <br />
girls room. It was almost stereotypical, with some stuffed animals from her childhood standing guard by her <br />
bed on a big bookcase, and a vanity mirror off to the right. Her laptop was pink, which made Mary Kate groan <br />
in frustration.<br />
<br />
That night, Mary Kate's dreams were spent in pure terror, waiting for that demon girl and the vampire woman to <br />
be seen floating above his window waiting to torment him even further, perhaps changing him into something <br />
even more ridiculous. Thankfully, nothing outside the ordinary happened.<br />
<br />
The next day at school, Grant was surprised to find how ordinary the inside of St. Francis' was. He had always <br />
wondered what the inside of this school looked like ever since his sister had gone here for high school over <br />
twenty years ago. It wasn't as mysterious, nor filled with the dirty, exploitation film secrets that you here <br />
about so often occurring at girls schools as he was led to believe. Definitely no Lillian Hellman's &quot;The <br />
Children's Hour&quot; going on.<br />
<br />
The classes were surprisingly easy for Mary Katherine/Grant, who was no scholar but still well read enough to <br />
get by a tenth grade curriculum. During lunch, he sat down with other girls from his class. From what he could <br />
make out, Mary Kate was somewhat of an outsider. When she told about her encounter with a vampire in as clear <br />
and non-excitable way as she could, she got this response:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please&quot; sighed Colleen, rolling her eyes. &quot;Remember that time when you told everyone that you were <br />
possessed by the demon Etrigan? The penguins laughed their asses off behind your back for weeks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what about when you thought you had discovered a &quot;kill people&quot; notebook, like in that cartoon?&quot; added <br />
Penelope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or how about when you tried to argue with Ms. Finster that Marconi was really an alien since a human being <br />
couldn't possibly have invented the radio&quot; pointed out Edie with disdain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or when you said that your parents were Freemasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or when you lied about getting abducted by lizard people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or when you ran away and tried to get yourself shanghai'd because you read too many pirate books. Gosh, grow <br />
up Mary Kate. We're young adults now, and if you continue to make up fantastical stories, one day you'll end <br />
up in a-&quot;. But Amanda was cut off, her screaming at the bizarre sight in front of her totally instinctual.</p>
