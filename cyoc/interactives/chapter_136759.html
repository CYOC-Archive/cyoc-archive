<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tia quickly found herself standing in the middle of a sloped plain overlooking a vast countryside, off in the far distance was what appeared to be a tree-line of what looked to be the entry to a forest much further down the mountain.<br />
<br />
Tia shivered for a moment before Apus wrapped her arms and wings around her, Apus&#39; belly slightly poking into her back, feeling larger than it did that morning; and the warmth of her body was enough to make her feel like it was a summer&#39;s day just from how hot her body radiated.<br />
<br />
Another dragoness laughed nearby, and Tia turned to her and saw a white scaled dragoness with a blue underbelly colour on her exposed midriff. &quot;Already warming up to the newbie? Didn&#39;t know the tail slut had a romantic side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Apus actually laughed back in return. &quot;Nice to see you too Frost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tia raised a brow at the new dragoness. &quot;Are you at all related to Snowy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, newbie is quick on the uptake, or maybe its just the names,&quot; Frost said, &quot;me and Snowy are second generation warriors to the same mother. You&#39;d probably name your hatchlings the first word you thought of as well if you had to name hundreds of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tia sighed. &quot;Makes sense... Guess you&#39;re not mad about Apus getting her as full as she is if she&#39;s just one of many sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Apus looked down on Tia and blushed. &quot;Where did you hear that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The commander implied you&#39;d done something like that at least once, and yet said something that suggested Snowy was the first in this group to get like that,&quot; Tia said, her tail wagging happily between Apus&#39; legs in a way that made her feel like she was teasing Apus.<br />
<br />
Frost giggled, rubbing her belly that looked about five months pregnant. &quot;Apus ended up getting splinters in her vagina last time we had to take a hike through the Forest, she was so sensitive down there afterwards that when Apus found herself too horny to cope, Snowy had to fuck her tail instead... Only to end up climaxing about a dozen times before Apus could even climax once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Apus seemed to be blushing even as she pressed her breasts into Tia&#39;s back. &quot;I&#39;m never gonna live that down am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Frost said, &quot;in other news, I figured it would be easier to prepare some packs in advance, so at least we can get a head start on the others.&quot; Frost grabbed the edge of what at first appeared to be a rock only to pull it away and reveal it was some kind of tarp hiding a couple of hiking bags.<br />
<br />
Tia smirked. &quot;Well, that&#39;s one way to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Even with only a few eggs inside her, not enough that she though anyone would notice her belly, she could certainly feel them sliding around inside her with every step. It was unusual, and it provoked her arousal, enough that by the time the day was almost halfway through and they stopped for a break next to a spring, she felt more like she needed relief than she needed to eat. She lay on her back, slaying her wings and legs, as one of her clawed hands made its way down between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you&#39;re eager to catch up to our size,&quot; Frost said, &quot;most of us have at least six clutches in us, a bit conservative for only being a month into the first season of training... Then again, the higher ups would rather we only had one clutch a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Apus carefully pulled the chainmail off of Tia&#39;s shoulders, peeling the front of the armour off her to expose her breasts. Tia&#39;s eyes widened as she saw her own breasts leaking a bit of some form of milk, an amusing sight on a more reptilian creature, even a half-human one. Before she could say anything, Apus was already licking away the milk, almost causing her to cum right there, only for Apus to seal her climax by nibbling on her right nipple.<br />
<br />
As her toes curled and uncurled from the continued attention, Frost had moved over to her other nipple and breathed a small bit of some kind of icy energy over her breast, beading the milk running down her into what must have been ice cream against her skin; the chill making her nipple stand erect and even more sensitive, causing her to whine as Frost lapped up the remains, beginning to suckle when her chest was clean once more, causing another wave of contractions across her body.<br />
<br />
Her nipples did start to get a little less sensitive after that, but the two didn&#39;t let up on her, grinding their hips against her thighs and their breasts against hers, each exploring their hands across her back between her wings and down to caress her ass. Their tails intertwining with hers, only for her to discover that the underside of her tail was just as sensitive as the inside of her thighs, a fact she became intimately familiar with as they angled her tail tip towards her needy entrance, what little covering it pushed aside with little effort, and a rush of energy through her body erupted the moment the tip entered, her tongue lolling out as it did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; Tia cried out, &quot;just the tip?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tia felt Apus&#39; tongue glide into her mouth, their tongues intertwining even as their tails did as well, slowly pulsing deeper into her uncharted depths, and right as she felt resistance, like a wall blocking their path made of crackling energy buzzing inside her, and so her legs kicked like a horny bitch, and her tail squirmed inside her. Her relief came at last as she felt her tail pierce it, bundling together like a knot on the other side, even as her vision began to blur and flecks of light seemed to fill her vision.<br />
<br />
She soon collapsed, her stimulation unable to maintain itself, and her body just relaxed completely, leaving her panting, and contented, even as her belly began to feel the first signs of swelling with new life. Images of her two partners starting to come back into focus, as the sight of them both in sustained orgasm filled her vision.<br />
<br />
It was a good while before the rest of the group caught up with them, and saw them lying on the edge of a spring.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Tia struggled to keep up with Apus and frost as they were brought back to marching, her chainmail left hanging around her waist as her belly and breasts hung free, unable to wear it properly as her belly had swollen considerably since their little midday tryst. She was getting close to looking like she was just as gravid as Frost was earlier that morning, while both Frost and Apus must have looked about six months pregnant.<br />
<br />
… That seemed to be something she was beginning to figure out, each clutch trapped inside a dragon by magic adds about the size of a month of pregnancy. So by all rights, by the end of the day she&#39;d likely look about five months pregnant from the five times she&#39;d already came. Though thoughts that Apus would likely make sure to give her one last run over today seemed likely.<br />
<br />
As nightfall approached, and they entered the forest, the soldiers escorting their little training group led them down a side path to a little structure out of size of the edge of the forest; looking like a twisted mix of tent, wooden hut and stone cottage. The guards posted welcomed them warmly inside, even as some snickered at the &#39;newbie&#39; she was being this gravid this quickly. However a couple of them whispered something that interested her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A purple one? I almost thought they were a myth, no wonder she&#39;s eager to bear young,&quot; one said.<br />
Another next to the first grinned. &quot;Not just rare, potent... They say their breath is raw magic, shining like a bright light, and ignoring armour like its not even there... Nobody has seen it in ages though, their native territories are so far beneath the earth that not even a typical dwarf would dig that far down... They&#39;re like some kind of ghost story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tia&#39;s eyes widened, unsure what to make of their stories, only for Apus to kiss her on the neck, and whisper the words &quot;my princess&quot; into her fin like ears.<br />
<br />
Tia blushed, wondering what would go on inside this new base camp they&#39;d entered inside this forest.</p>
