<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several weeks later, Paola and Nicole were already getting used to donkey life in the vineyard. After each heavy journey carrying baskets full of grapes, they were rewarded by the farmer feeding them some sweet oats, berries and even grapes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, hey, this isn&#39;t so bad after all,&quot; Paola thought to herself as they ate some sweet fruit. &quot;Are we the luckiest jennies around, or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, being donkeys may not be so bad.&quot; Jayden thought the same while she moved her tail back and forth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three years later, Paola and Nicole were young adult jennies, that was because they grew up like donkeys now. Their lives were now in donkey years.<br />
<br />
By that time, Pleasure Island was found, shut down, and quarantined. The talking donkeys still on the island like Giovanna were rescued and returned to their families. <br />
<br />
Giovanna had already grown into a young, strong and healthy adult jenny. Like Paola and Nicole, Giovanna had begun to like her new life.<br />
<br />
Now she liked being on all fours, wagging her tail while the fresh air passed through her legs, tasting the hay, pulling the coach, braying wildly for a long period of time for no apparent reason… she even stopped feeling ashamed of going to “ the bathroom ”outdoors and in public. Although she could speak, if any human seeing her, that human would think that Giovanna had always been a donkey since she was born.<br />
<br />
When Giovanna returned home, she told her parents that she wanted to sleep in the garden and eat from it, never wear clothes again and to work pulling carts. She even wanted to live with Candlewick.<br />
<br />
Candlewick began to speak a little like a human being, though he still brayed a lot. However, that was enough to be able to communicate with his family and tell them that he had a girlfriend, Giovanna.<br />
<br />
The families of the two donkeys in love even organized a kind of outdoor wedding for them. They lived happily.<br />
<br />
The Coachman and his Minions were sentenced to life for his crimes.<br />
<br />
Some of the boys and girls that had already been turned into donkeys and sold were rescued, recovering little by little their human voices back as they returned to their families. Others weren&#39;t so lucky, whether it was because their new owners weren&#39;t willing to believe they were children and give them up, or because those children had given up all hope of ever seeing their friends and families again, or they were ashamed that their families saw them as asses, or have bonded better with their new owner. <br />
<br />
The last reason mentioned happened with Paola and Nicole.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s seems I&#39;ve recovered my human voice, Nicole.&quot; Paola said, amazed by this miracle. &quot;For some reason a part of the donkey curse has been broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that right, Paola&quot;, Nicole smirked. &quot;Can we tell our owners?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet... but let&#39;s tell them the truth about... you know....&quot; Paola said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Nicole said, hanging her head a little. &quot;It&#39;s been so long. I&#39;d almost forgotten about what it&#39;s like to be a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here, but, I&#39;ll tell them.&quot; Paola then stepped out, and ran over to the Farmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there, Paola,&quot; the farmer smiled as he reached out to pet her. Paola cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
Paola was one of those who had bonded better with the farmer. Nicole, on the other hand, wanted to be returned to her former family, but also didn&#39;t want to abandon her best friend Paola.<br />
<br />
Nicole was already enjoying being a real ass, being in a stable, eating hay, grass, or even oatmeal and fruit, wagging her tail from side to side, trotting on all fours, braying as hard as she could, not wearing clothes, not going to the boring school, even Nicole started to feel a greater desire to mate with a jack. But she also missed her old human life.<br />
<br />
After the long explanation, the farmer contacted their families. When Nicole&#39;s parents appeared, she apologized to her parents for running away, leaving them, and not doing her chores and homework, and said that she had learned her lesson. <br />
<br />
They forgave her, if only for the fact that they were happy to see their daughter again, although she would never be human again. <br />
<br />
The same happened with Paola&#39;s parents. However, Paola confessed them her rare desire to continue working in the vineyard. Her parents, initially surprised, eventually accepted.<br />
<br />
Given this situation, Nicole told her parents that she could not leave Paola on the farm, so she would stay and live there too. The parents of both promised to visit them often.<br />
<br />
Some days later, the farmer purchased two male donkeys, to be Paola and Nicole&#39;s mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what shall we name these two?&quot; the farmer asked Paola and Nicole. The two females already felt quite attracted to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can name them, huh?&quot; Nicole said, then looked at the male that most attracted her. &quot;What do you think of the name Enzo?&quot; she asked that one. Enzo nodded in response to his new name.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to name you Ivo, is that ok?&quot; Paola asked her new mate. Ivo brayed smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so handsome?&quot; Paola said blushing. Then both pairs nuzzled each other lovingly.<br />
<br />
Paola and Nicole were now full young adult donkeys and it wasn&#39;t long before 5 donkey foals were born, 3 to Paola and Ivo, and 2 to Nicole and Enzo.<br />
<br />
With that, Nicole and Paola started learning a new lesson about how to be a good mother. They found it amazing that they had went from rebellious teenagers years earlier to being proud donkey mothers. <br />
<br />
They had learned many lessons in that time, but the most valuable lesson they did learn was not to act like a total ass and take responsibility for themselves.<br />
<br />
Nicole and Paola did get a mate and a new family. And they couldn&#39;t have been happier at that. Looking back, it was hard to believe that Pleasure Island was the best thing that ever happened to them both.</p>
