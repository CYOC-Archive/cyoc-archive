<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick’s feet bounced as he tried to concentrate on what his teacher was saying but the thought of the clown nose filled his mind. All last night his dreams were filled with clowns and him becoming a clown being silly and carefree. He glanced over at Mary and for a moment his mind thought of something else. She was beautiful blond hair cascaded down her back framing her face with green eyes staring out from under it; her soft pink lips pressed together in concentration. She felt his eyes on her and looked over upon seeing him she rolled her eyes and concentrated on the teacher again, she was also a stuck up bitch but he couldn&#39;t get over her. He imagines juggling balls in front of her as she laughs at his antics; her smooth skin turning white as her pink lips grow and turn upward into a smile......Patrick shakes his head and tries to focus on the teacher again. He barely makes it through class and makes his way through the crowded halls to the lunch room and gets lunch. He sees Seth and a bunch of other boys seated at a table and joins them. They were talking about the party and the new video games.<br />
&quot;The clowns were cool.&quot; Patrick pipes up hoping to steer the conversation back to his favorite subject now that his friends like clowns.<br />
There was an ominous pause before &quot;HA, you liked the clowns?&quot; Patrick felt a cold sensation in his stomach and scrambled for a response as everyone laughed.<br />
&quot;I liked the magic show.&quot; He blurt out and some of the boys stopped laughing<br />
&quot;Yea, I guess you’re right.&quot; The conversation drifted of back to the new video games and Patrick tried to chock down his school lunch. The effect of the clown noses must have worn off much to Patrick’s disappointment. He finished his lunch and put his tray away, turning around he bumped into Mary.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t touch me loser.&quot; She says as she pushes him back &quot;And stop staring at me in class.&quot; The girls around her laughed at him. Patrick felt his face turning red and left the lunch room quickly. The rest of his day didn&#39;t go any better as he was yelled at by all his teachers for not paying attention. By the time he got home he was feeling down. He was a latchkey kid and his mom wouldn&#39;t be home for at least two hours. <br />
His heart pounded as his thoughts drifted up to his room, if there was ever a time he needed to be cheered up. He walked to his room and closed his door and stood in front of the mirror with the clown nose in hand. His heart was pumping so hard he was surprised it did not pop out of his chest as a slipped the nose on and felt the tingle slowly spread out. That stupid bitch Mary why couldn’t he get her out of his mind and his friends why couldn’t they still like clowns, Patrick was unsure what to do with himself. He stood in front of the mirror for five minutes waiting for his skin to lighten, what if the clown nose didn&#39;t work anymore? Feeling down and depressed he reached up to take off the nose when he noticed his hand was darker. He looked carefully again at his face and noticed his fair skin was turning a shade of dark peach except around his mouth and eyes which were pale. He stood in front of the mirror transfixed for the next five minutes as the skin around his mouth and eyes turn completely white. Was he becoming a auguste? Excitement rushed through him as he watched himself transform, the silly feeling returned and he laughed. When his feet started to ache he kicked off his shoes and watched in delight as his feet grew. Looking up he noticed his hair was turning darker and it looked as though he was growing a beard, he was becoming a hobo clown. Patrick laughed at the realization, it matched his mood. A red blush like a lite sunburn formed on his cheeks as his eyebrows disappeared and thick ones drew themselves above the white blocks around his eyes. His lower lip turned black and curled upward into a small grin and his hair turned complete black and became messy and unkept. His pants suddenly dropped to around his ankles to reveal a pair of large yellow and pink polka dotted boxers. He didn&#39;t put those on this morning as he laughed and giggled at the silliness of it all. He reached down to pull up his no faded and patched pants and securing them with the bright suspenders that appeared. His feet felt different and he looked down to find them no in worn brown leather clown shoes. He looked up and admired his appearance and straighten his large very loud tie and his bowler hat.<br />
He felt so carefree and funny as he turned to walk out of his room, he tripped on his large feet and summersaulted over and landed on his back. He lay there laughing at himself before getting up and out of his room. He tucked his thumbs under his suspenders over his growing stomach and waddled out to the kitchen for a snack. He spotted a bowl of apples and grabbing a couple he juggled them on his way to the living room. Jumping on the couch he emitted a sound like a whoopie cushion and burst into laughter again. He jumped up and cannon balled the couch again letting out the same noise but bouncing off it and landing on his stomach which bounced him upright. Grabbing a apple he tried to bite into it but ran into a problem. His two front teeth had grown giving him some buck teeth. He waddled over to the mirror in the hall and smiled admiring his new teeth before finally finding a way to have a snack. He spent the afternoon acting silly and enjoying himself before his heart stopped at the sound of the garage door being opened.<br />
Shit, his mom was here. He ripped off the clown nose and waddled as fast as he could to his room and closed the door. His heart pounding in fright he thought franticly about what to do. He couldn&#39;t pretend to be asleep his mom would check on him and see him. He heard his mom call for him and start to walk up the hall. <br />
Patrick finally got an idea and yelled &quot;Hey mom, I&#39;m changing and going to take a shower. I got sweaty and dirty playing after school.&quot; He heard his mom stop at his door as he held his breath. &quot;Oh&quot; She sounded surprised normally she had to nag him to get in the shower. &quot;Ok, I will start dinner.&quot; He heard her walk down the hall. He slowly got undressed as he finally heard noise in the kitchen. He slowly opened his door and listened before bolting to the bathroom and starting the shower. He stare at himself sadly watching himself turn back to normal. He got in the shower and watched his body lighten to its normal color feeling something missing inside. His mom finally banged on the door complaining about the water bill or something and he slowly got out. Examining his reflection in the mirror he made sure he was back to normal before leaving for his room. His mom yelled at him for messing up the living room especially if he was dirty and he was sullen and depressed all night before going to bed feeling empty.</p>
