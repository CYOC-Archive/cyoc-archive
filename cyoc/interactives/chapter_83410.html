<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was happy to have the table between them he could tell that both his father and brother were erect and ready to go again but right now he didn&#39;t want any part of that.<br />
<br />
The first thing Jake said was, &quot;How are you going to go to work like this?&quot; He knew that his father had been absent from the office for more than three hours. <br />
<br />
Steve looked at him quizzically and said, &quot;You know with our condition, it&#39;s easier if both if us work at home. Every once in a while, we&#39;ll go to a convention but most of the fun stays at home.&quot; Steve put his hand on Eric&#39;s shoulder and smiled. <br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;I guess that&#39;s a factor of the change. Neither of you could hold down a nine to five with your the way your body works.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, Speaking if which, it&#39;s about time for us to get dressed for work. <br />
<br />
Steve went over to a closet and pulled out two greasy looking automotive jumpsuits. His dad bent over and pulled on the suit. <br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;You work on cars? I guess that makes sense.&quot; For the first time, his dad&#39;s face grew worried. &quot;Those punks must have really done a number on you with that curse.&quot; Come out to the garage. <br />
<br />
Jake followed his father and Eric out to the garage. He noticed Eric&#39;s bright red truck had been positioned in front of a camera. The hood was up and tools were scattered around everywhere. <br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;In this scene my junior mechanic is going to make his move while I&#39;m changing the oil under the car.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jake looked around and began to remember. He was in a family of gay porn actors. <br />
<br />
His dad looked at him and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t give you a part in this one son. If you&#39;d like, you can go up to your room and do some cam stuff before we eat dinner as a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake backed out of the garage and walked up into his room.  He noticed that he now had way more toys tools and vids in his room. His posters were now mostly explicit advertisements from films he and his family had made but some were of other men that he had still fantasized about. Jake looked around his room and noticed that there were cameras pointing to his bed, over his computer, and a quick glance in his bathroom proved that there were cameras pointing in every direction there as well. <br />
<br />
Jake looked at his selection if porns and chose one with a football theme.<br />
<br />
Jake watched as the two large men began to fuck in their jerseys and he began to have an idea. Of course, this idea was accompanied by an erection so he grabbed a large vibrator and some lube and began to work his cock and ass. As he orgasmed, he realized that he had a plan. <br />
<br />
Jake got up and cleaned himself off. Then he went into his dad&#39;s room and to the large cross that Jessie had been suspended on. <br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; Jake knew that because of the ball gag his father had fastened on him, there was no way he would be able to speak. <br />
<br />
Jake watched as Jessie&#39;s eyes widened. He was unable to speak or move. <br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;You get both. For your transformation, your long tongue will now have some more properties. Your saliva has the ability to change a man. By licking an ear, you will hyonotize him into doing your bidding, licking his cock will cause it to grow, Liking his balls will increase semen production, and licking his body anywhere else will cause the muscles of the area to increase. These effects will only be temporary lasting only twenty four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare,&quot; You will become a permanent servant to this household. You will be completely subservient to the wills of Steve, Eric or I but my orders will always super cred those of my brother or father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie looked crestfallen again. He now knew that he was trapped in his subservience. His transformation had given him hope but he was truly helpless now. <br />
<br />
Jake undid the gag and Jessie said, &quot;Transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;transform me into a muscle hunk.&quot;<br />
Jessie waited and said, &quot;Transform by gaining twenty lbs of muscle. Because you didn&#39;t choose, I dare you to fuck Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;I knew making you my servant would have good results. You&#39;re always so creative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake left him hanging on the cross and Jessie began to snake his tongue down and lick his shaft in preparation for the show he was going to watch. <br />
<br />
Jake entered Tom as his muscles began to increase. As soon as he entered Tom, the tiny cock he had gifted him with began to fm dribble a steady stream. He spurted with every thrust and soon there was a puddle on the table that was dribbling into the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot; Jake said. Tom was still gagged so Jake said, &quot;From now on, your body will be in a state of constant arousal. You will no longer be unable to cum unless you are in my presence. You are going to need to hook yourself to a gallon jug in order to catch everything as you go about your day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare, you will now be completely obedient to my will but your focus will be on cooking for us and cleaning the house. You will be our maid and you will sleep on a dog bed in my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s eyes widened as he realized he was now trapped in the house forever. He could only ever be a plaything for Jake and his family. Jake reached up and pulled the gag off if him and said, &quot;Use the curse on me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom said @Transform or Dare?&quot; And Jaje responded &quot;Dare.&quot; Tom said, &quot;I dare you to cum inside me so I can get back to cleaning up this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake let out a groan and emptied himself into his new servant.</p>
