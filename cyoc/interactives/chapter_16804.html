<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So let's get out of here&quot; grunted the orc, breaking eye contact with Brian and striding over to where Joe and Mike were to grab a huge axe while the two men shied away from him. &quot;Oh, for god's sakes, guys, it's just me. Brian. Okay? So let's go&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like this.&quot; said Joe. &quot;I ain't going anywhere until you figure out how to put me back to a dragon, okay? Christine? Can you do it?&quot;<br />
She got up and paced over to him, closing her eyes and muttering various things under her breath while the rest of them watched. A slight glow surrounded Joe for a moment and he shivered. Then she opened her eyes. &quot;I don't think so. The spell's a very specific orcish one; to break it, we'd need the shaman who did this to you in the first place.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then he'll do it&quot; said the orcish Brian, smacking the side of the axe in his hand and making everyone in the room jump. &quot;We can't do it here, but there's a valley a half a mile to the north that can let us escape through the mountains without being seen, even with a giant dragon in the party. I'll tell him we're going there for some more private fun with you guys. He'll follow.&quot;<br />
A silence greeted his statement as everyone just stared at him. Christine broached &quot;So... does this mean you know what he knew?&quot;<br />
Brian shook his head. &quot;Not until just then. I think I know what I need to know, when I need to know it. But trust me; this'll work. I'll be back soon. Look captive.&quot; And with that, the massive green figure strode out of the tent.<br />
<br />
Some time later, they were being led downwards along a thick path, hands bound whilst the Shaman, the 'Orc chief' and two half-orc guards prodded them along from behind. Brian had taken a weapon belt from the hut, and had a two swords dangling from it, a bow strung to his back, and an axe swinging from his hand. They reached a clearing and stopped. &quot;On knees&quot; growled the shaman, the guards pushing the prisoners down. They obediently buckled. &quot;So...&quot; the shaman grinned, ripping off his loincloth to reveal a massive erection, the guards following suit; Christine winced as she felt a the rock-hard member press into her back, a look behind and up showing the guard sadistically grinning at her. &quot;Who doez ya wanna to have fun with first?&quot; asked the shaman. &quot;The elf is yours, course, but I wants to try the horse-man...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Brian shook his head. &quot;Not that fun yet. I've been wanting to test my skills against a better enemy. Nothing's been a challenge. So I want something... bigger.&quot; The shaman's eyes widened. &quot;Youz's mad?&quot; he spat. &quot;It'z a dragon! It's-&quot; &quot;SILENCE!&quot; roared his master. Change him back, now! Or can't you?&quot; The shaman didn't reply, but instead turned to Joe and began incanting. The clearing became eerily silent for a moment, and then Joe burst outwards, scaled skin ripping out of his human flesh, his old body being pulled apart. Christine screamed as she was showered with parts of Joe's human body and a massive dragon loomed over them all.<br />
<br />
For a moment nobody moved, then the Dragon turned to face the Orc Chief. &quot;Thanks&quot; he said. &quot;You're welcome&quot; replied the hulking Brian, and almost lazily swept his axe out behind him without even looking. The head of one of the guards flew across the clearing and landed in the scrub. And then Joe was roaring and the shaman was screaming at this betrayal. The other guard ran towards Brian and struck at him with his axe; Brian didn't even bother to use his own, but swung his arm around, smashing though the axe's handle and sent the guard flying through the air and into a tree trunk, where he dropped to the ground, motionless. It was then a shriek from Christine gained their attention. The shaman had gotten to her, and was holding her with one hand, around which a black aura had formed. Christine was gasping. &quot;Weapons down now, or she dies&quot; The others stood, frozen, while his grip tightened. &quot;I mean i-&quot; And he slumped to the ground, a dart sticking out of his back. Shira stepped out of the bushes, a dart bow in her hand.<br />
<br />
Mike was the first to speak. &quot;Is he dead?&quot; &quot;Yes. Poison dart.&quot; replied Shira. &quot;I think&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;Anyway, we need to get going. This band, whilst a constant annoyance, is not our target. We need to get further north, however, before we can rest in relative safety. I take it you managed to turn this creature to your side?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm Brian&quot; rumbled the Orc, just as his elvish counterpart volunteered &quot;He's Me.&quot; Shira paused for a moment, then said &quot;You can explain what happened on the way. For now, we have to make haste.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, after redistributing weapons, they set off, making far better time than before, for this time everybody had a ride. Christine was again on Joe's back, whilst Shira had hesitantly consented to ride on Mike, who was looking very full of himself with her on his back; she just looked conflicted, as if she couldn't decide to be pleased or terrified to be riding him again. Brian, for his part, was sitting on the shoulders of the Orc Chief, who barely even felt his weight as he strode forward, his long gait eating up the distance easily. The Orc body housing an elven mind (which was, for that matter, originally human) smiled as he felt a hardness from between the legs wrapped around him press into the back of his neck. He gently stroked the long elven legs he was holding steady and muttered 'soon...' under his breath as they walked off into the night.</p>
