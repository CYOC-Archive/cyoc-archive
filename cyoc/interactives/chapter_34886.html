<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Uncharacteristically, Jacob blew up, "DAMN! I WISH THIS SUIT WOULD JUST FUCKING FIT! THIS THING NEEDS TO BE SO MUCH TIGHTER!"Seth treaded water beside him, keeping his eyes down, looking towards the bottom of the pool, unsure how to react to his friend's sudden and surprising outburst. It wasn't like Jacob to get upset about something like this, in fact, Jacob almost never got upset, Seth thought to himself. "C'MON!" Jacob roared a little louder than he meant to at his best friend. He continued, "Let's just swim." He started off, with Seth following meekly behind him, not wanting to anger his friend anymore than he already was.<br />
<br />
The suit caught water everywhere and slowed Jacob down so much that Seth's fingertips began brushing his toes as he swam behind him. Jacob still upset about the money he had spent on the speedo decided to just swim like they fit, in a decision of rebellious delusion.<br />
<br />
The speedo wasn't catching as much water now, but Jacob felt slower and slower now. His slight body felt like it was sinking more and more with each stroke, like his naturally buoyant feathery frame was being dragged down. Normally, he could feel the wind and cool air on his shoulders and butt, now they were completely submerged. He doubled his efforts and felt his muscles begin to strain as he deliberately and forcefully started swimming harder and harder, energized by his anger.<br />
<br />
Seth slowed down, he knew he was getting too close to Jacob, he could practically see the space between his toes. He eased off, but nothing seemed to change, he could still see Jacob so close to him, even through the distortion of the water and Jacob's furious kicking.<br />
<br />
I don't know what's come over him, but we need to talk. Something's must be bugging him, thought Seth. Seth climbed out of the pool and looked down on his friend in the water, only to immediately look away in shock, then back in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Swimming in the pool was a huge, naked mountain of a man. He could tell because of how much bigger he looked than the tiles lining the pool floor. He and Jacob would compete to see who could handstand the longest in the water, and he knew that their hands barely stretched from one end of a tile to the other. The man creating the pool-wide waves looked like he could cover more than two tiles with his hand. This guy made the three foot end of the pool look so shallow, Seth was sure he was going to be beached in no time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jacob felt so heavy and large, but was somehow making it from one end of the pool to the other pretty fast now, faster than he had ever remembered doing it. He slowed his stroke and realized he couldn't hear Seth's stroke in the water. He looked over and saw the three foot marker and stood up. He found his friend on the deck staring down at him, with huge eyes. Jacob watched as Seth's eyes dropped down to his speedos. Jacob, completely unsure how to take his best friend checking him out, covered himself quickly, almost by instinct. As his hands and fingers cupped and covered his more private area, he finally realized there wasn't a shred of material on him. Adding to that, his waist wasn't beneath the water at all, his pelvis stood above the waterline, fully exposing himself to Seth. How the Hell did this happen, Jacob thought to himself! He knew the speedos probably fell off while swimming, but how could the waterline be lower, had someone drained the pool while they were in there? Had it been Seth? Was all of this; the too-large suit, the water drop, part of some practical joke? Too many things were going through his head. Jacob decided, more important than anything else, was getting a suit on. Jacob didn't notice the small shredded piece of nylon floating away. <br />
<br />
Seth stood there, dumbfounded, as a very large, very powerful looking man, literally, stepped out of the three foot pool, standing taller than the lockerroom door frame behind him. Barely containing all of himself with two hands, the near-giant asked him in a huge, deep, core-jarring voice, but with a pleading innocent and mischievous face, "SETH. QUICK. GET ME A SUIT OR SOMETHING, BUD." All Seth could do was stare at the man's nipples, which were a little above his eye level, even with the guy hunched over.</p>
