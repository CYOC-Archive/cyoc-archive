<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tricia thought a moment, “Well, you’ve always been a kinky one. I like that about you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
“I just never knew you were this kinky. But, I think I have an idea to up the ante a bit, if you’re willing to getting a bit weirder.”<br />
<br />
Her offer intrigued Jeff. “Ok, what did you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
“Can I have the remote thing?” she asked carefully. “My idea involves all three of us, and I want it to be a surprise to you when it happens. Can I set the changes myself?”<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated for a second, but then handed over the emitter. “Sure, here you go.” He trusted Tricia enough to share some of his strange fetishes with her, and he knew that she had her own fetishes beyond the ones they shared. He felt he could trust her with the Chronivac too.<br />
<br />
Tricia took about a minute to enter the settings for their change on the emitter. It looked like it would be a complicated one. Jeff didn’t know if he should be excited or worried by that. When she had finished, she announced, “Ok, done. Are you ready?”<br />
<br />
“Ready as I’ll ever be,” Jeff said. He gave her a quick kiss. “Let’s roll.”<br />
<br />
Tricia activated the emitter and the whole world seemed to shift around them. Jeff could feel his body changing shape. He looked around. Everything seemed to be growing around him, except for Tricia. The two of them seemed to be getting smaller, no, younger. Tricia definitely looked like a girl now. He imagined that he was looking like a boy as well. The room kept growing, and Jeff noticed that his clothes and Tricia’s clothes were shrinking right along with them as they became toddlers. Their shrinking slowed to a halt leaving them about 18 months old, but Jeff noticed that Tricia’s face seemed to be changing even after her body had stopped. From the neck down she had the body of a toddler, but from the neck up her face was growing even younger. Her red hair thinned out and her face grew rounder and more babyish. When the change was complete, Tricia had the head of an infant on the body of a toddler. She still wore the same jeans, sneakers, and tank top, only now they were sized down to fit her little body. Even her infant ears were pierced as they had been when she was a teenager. The emitter seemed huge in her little hands.<br />
<br />
She smiled and giggled as she looked at him and down at her own body, Jeff noticed that she had very few teeth now. In spite of that, he could still recognize his girlfriend there. She looked so cute and innocent.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” was all Jeff could think to say, but when he said it, he pronounced it more like “Wah.” Not unexpectedly, he sounded like a baby now.<br />
<br />
“Howuh you wike yowr widdo new bay-bee bah-dee, Jeffee?” Tricia asked in her adorable little baby voice.<br />
<br />
He held up his hands and flexed his stubby little fingers experimentally. They felt so strange. “Itsuh awigh’, I gus,” he babbled. “Awigh’… Uht,” he repeated, but try as he might, he couldn’t get his baby mouth to pronounce the word correctly. He didn’t have enough teeth or tongue dexterity to do much more than babble. Looking at her baby head and slightly older toddler body, he asked, “Why nah awl bay-bee or awl toduwuh?”<br />
<br />
“Bay-bee canna wawk, an’ toduwuh ea’ weal foo’.”<br />
<br />
“Wah?” Jeff was even more confused. “Wah eefoo?”<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled at him patiently. “Ea’… ta… weal… Foo’… da.”<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at her blankly.<br />
<br />
“Wet’s go see yowr widdo sistuh,” she said, taking his little hand and leading him into the living room. “Ahm hungwy.”<br />
<br />
As they waddled into the room, Jeff spotted his sister, Jamie, where he had left her last, sitting on the couch watching TV. Strangely, Jeff thought that her breasts seemed even larger now, but he figured that must be because he was so much smaller than her now. She noticed them approach and smiled. “Hey guys!” she said. “When’d you get here Tricia?”<br />
<br />
“Jus’ now,” Tricia said. She put the emitter down on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
“Cool.”<br />
<br />
Jeff knew he shouldn’t be surprised that Jamie found nothing strange about the situation, but he did have a hard time believing that Jamie wouldn’t be amazed that his baby/toddler girlfriend had just shown up at the house by herself.<br />
<br />
“You guys want to watch some TV?” Jamie asked as she stood up. “I can get out of your way if you want some time alone.” Standing up, Jamie looked so much bigger than them both, and Jeff was sure that her breasts had grown.<br />
<br />
“Naw,” said Tricia. “Weez hungwy. We wanna dwink, pweese.” She looked at Jeff and smirked.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” said Jamie. “Sure, I’ll let you have a sip. I was just feeling a bit full actually.” She unzipped her dress and pulled it off, revealing her incredible figure covered only by her bra and panties. “Come on up,” she said and patted the couch next to her.<br />
<br />
Tricia grabbed the edge of the couch and told Jeff, “Hewlp me up.” Jeff gave her butt a push and she scrambled up onto the couch. Next he grabbed the couch and she helped pull him up. When they had finished climbing, Jeff turned to find his sister taking off her bra. He watched, stunned, as she let her enormous breasts out of their confinement. Jeff felt a strange hunger when he saw them. His mouth watered. A little white drop of milk dripped from each nipple.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled at them. “Ok, one for each of you,” she said and then added as a warning, “No biting.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Tricia and smiled. “Thaynkyoo,” he said to the both of them. He and Tricia kissed again, a sloppy baby kiss, and then climbed over onto Jamie’s lap.<br />
<br />
Jeff took Jamie’s left breast and Tricia took her right. Up close he was amazed at the size and beauty of her breasts, each one as large as his head. The areolas were dark and broader than his whole hand, and the nipples, so huge and inviting. Jamie cradled them both gently in her arms and they each took a breast and wrapped their lips around a nipple. Her warm milk filled Jeff’s baby mouth. He closed his eyes to focus his attention on the taste. It was the best milk he could remember tasting, so sweet and rich. Greedily he sucked it down as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
“Easy, Jeffy,” said Jamie. “There’s plenty in there for you. Just take your time.”<br />
<br />
As he slowed his sucking to a regular pace, Jeff opened his eyes and looked over at his girlfriend as her infant mouth sucked at his 10-year-old sister’s giant breast. It was all so twisted, and yet, so very beautiful as well. Tricia looked like a little angel, so innocent, but Jeff knew that she was anything but innocent. That thought thrilled him. He never had imagined that Tricia could be so freaky.<br />
<br />
Jamie sighed comfortably. “Oh, you guys are so much better than the pump. I love having you in my lap like this. It’s like you’re my own private baby dolls.” She stroked the wispy hair on their infant heads.<br />
<br />
Jeff lost track of time. What felt like maybe half an hour later, he began to feel that he had drank his fill from Jamie. He let her swollen nipple slip from his lips, still wet with her milk and his saliva. “Ahm Fuwl,” he announced.<br />
<br />
“Me too!” said Tricia.<br />
<br />
Jamie set them beside her on the couch and left the room, her breasts still hanging from her bare chest, now slightly less swollen with milk. Tricia just looked and Jeff and giggled, they both had faces wet with saliva and milk. It felt gross, but Jeff was happy to share the experience with Tricia. Jamie returned a minute later with a towel to wipe their faces dry. Then she slipped on her bra and pulled up her dress. “I’m going upstairs to do some homework,” she said. “Are you guys going to be alright down here?”<br />
<br />
“Shuwr,” said Trcia. “Jeffee an’ I gotta stuh-dee fo’ owr Twigonometwee qwiz.”<br />
<br />
“Trigonometry?” said Jamie. “Man, I thought that fractions were tough. I can’t imagine what high school math must be like.”<br />
<br />
Jeff watched this whole exchange with a confused look on his face. “High schoo’?”<br />
<br />
“Ya, Jeffee, high schoo’,” said Tricia. She smiled at his surprise. “We gotta histowee exam wayter on dis week, too.”<br />
<br />
Jamie headed off and said, “Well, good luck, you two,” as she ran upstairs.<br />
<br />
Tricia lay her whole little body flat on the couch and sighed contentedly. “I wuv dis cowch. So soff’.”<br />
<br />
Jeff lay down next to her and took her little hand in his own. “Is nice,” he said, then added, “Howr we in high schoo’ if weur bay-bees?”<br />
<br />
“Wealiddy changuh.”<br />
<br />
“’Wealiddy,’ you say?” said Jeff, kidding her about her voice.<br />
<br />
“Yep, weally weal wealiddy.” She rolled over towards him and he rolled to meet her. They kissed, their baby tongues slipping around each other and tasting the milk left in their mouths. When they separated, she said, “You wike?”</p>
