<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Paul, Dude!&quot;  Matt pointed at Paul's quickly expanding cock. &quot;Whoa, Paul, you’re hung like a horse!”<br />
<br />
 Paul smiled to himself. He had always been well endowed, and it was  cool that others were noticing. But, then he realized that his best friend was staring at his dick, and that was just, well, fuck, it was weird.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you starin’ at me for? Man, don’t tell me you’re . . .” <br />
<br />
 Then Paul looked at why Matt was pointing and smiling, and what he saw left him speechless. His eyes widened and his mouth dropped open.&quot;Jesus Christ! What's happening?&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;I don't know, but I like what I see, Dude!&quot; Matt's grin was practically busting his face in two.<br />
<br />
 “Whoa! How can this be?&quot; Paul reached down to his cock. His fingers moved in slow wonder. He was almost afraid to touch it. &quot;Seriously man, it wasn’t that big when I had a piss hard-on this morning. I’m<br />
fuckin' huge!”  He wrapped his hand around the enormous organ and almost fainted from the pleasure he felt.<br />
<br />
Matt was starting to have sensations he’d never felt before, too. Pleasurable sensations. His dick started to get semi-hard at the sight of Paul’s magnificent member.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got a pretty nice one there too, Matt.” <br />
<br />
 Paul knelt on the tile floor and put his hand around Matt's pretty cock. Matt made an involuntary jerk and the spasm caused his dick to grow. It's pink head poked further out of Paul's grip as if it were trying to work its way to his mouth. Paul didn't need any encouragement. He took his best bud's tool into his moist, warm hole and started sucking like he'd never sucked before. The fact was he had never sucked a guy before. But, the way he was feeling, it seemed the most natural and best thing to do.<br />
<br />
Matt looked down at what was happening and moaned in pure ecstasy. His eyes rolled to the back of his head and his body began to tremble.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pual paused for a second. He pulled the cock back and let its forskin rap around the head of Matt's plump endowment. “Ya know, Bud, I was afraid I was the only uncut guy around here. Glad to see that I’m not alone.”<br />
<br />
Matt's eyes snapped back open. &quot;Wha?&quot; He looked down to his stiff prick and was amazed at what he saw.  “But…but . . . I wasn’t uncut before… was I? You know I can't remember. That's strange.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Paul took the stiff woody back into the sweet safety of his mouth and licked the hot rod with his tongue. &quot;Aw, who the hell cares? Right, Paul?&quot; Paul nodded his head up and down as he continued sucking on Matt. Matt began to tweak his nipple with one hand and move Paul's blond head with the other.  &quot;Dude, we’re both freakin’ hot!” Paul's head moved in more agreement. Matt smiled.<br />
<br />
 When Matt shot his hot laod down his buddy's throat, Paul almost couldn't handle the size of it. The stream of spunk seemed to just keep coming and coming. He struggled to swallow as much as he could and nearly chocked. Fotunately, Matt's torrent of testosteronal fluid ebb and left Paul pating his semi-distended belly.<br />
<br />
“Dude! It’s happening to all of us!” Matt exclaimed in awe. Pual smiled as one by one his teammates began to transform.<br />
<br />
 Dan and Nick loved watching the football team as they<br />
checked each other out in awe. Some guys flexed for<br />
each other, as Matt and Paul now were doing. Others started<br />
jerking off with each other. Everyone in the men’s<br />
locker room was enjoying themselves. It was more than obvious.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe how hot you are, Matt,” Paul said smiling. <br />
<br />
“The same goes for you, Stud,” Matt replied. “Why didn’t we ever notice each other before?” <br />
<br />
 Most of the football team had been in great physical conditiont before. That was to be expected with young, well-trained athletes. Now their bodies resembled perfection. No, it wasn't just a resemblance. The guys were perfect.<br />
<br />
 A guy named Billy, who had always beaning leaning towards the chubby side before, smiled as helooked in the mirror. He had the body of a completely beautiful stud. Billy was too busy admiring his newly acquired good-looks to notice that Dan had gifted him with the biggest tool on the whole football team. Dan felt it was only fair, seeing as he was the only<br />
 other guy besides Nick who’d taken the time to offer a simple “Hey!” to Dan when thet saw each other in the high school hallways. The extra inches in legth and circumfrence were Dan's way of saying thanks. That, and the fact that he fully intended to enjoy a heavy connection with Billy later on. <br />
<br />
 The sound of  a giant groan echoed off the locker room and shower walls. The entire team had groaned in unison.<br />
<br />
 “What’s wrong?” Nick nervously asked. “Are they going<br />
to be ok?”<br />
<br />
 “Don’t worry,” Dan replied. “They’ll be fine. In fact, they’ll<br />
be more than fine. They'll be outrageous!” <br />
<br />
 One by one, tails started to sprout out of every guy's beautiful backside. Each was the color of the guys’ normal hair, but they all varied in style. For<br />
instance, Paul’s was blonde and a little messy (which matched his personality, actually), almost traveling all the way down to his feet. Matt’s was dark brown, shorter, and looked well kept (Matt was famous for the amount of hair gel he used on his head to get each hair perfectly styled, so it was only natural to have a nicely trimmed tail as well). <br />
<br />
<br />
The sound of cracking bones was heard as the teammate’s bodies began to contort.<br />
<br />
“Are they in pain?” Nick was afraid that what he was hearing was something horrible. Though he wouldn't have given a damn for most of the guys in any other circumstance, hearing their moans and seeing how dramatically they were transforming was upsetting him.<br />
<br />
 “Trust me, Nick. None of them is in any pain. I’m not that mean a guy.” Dan grinned. “If anything, it just feels a little strange, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
 Some of the teammates hair grew longer and messy as Paul’s did, while others’ hair became curly. Some guys didn’t experience any hair-changes at all (on the head any way). Matt stroked his chin as a well-cropped<br />
beard sprouted from his jaw-line. <br />
<br />
 Other changes were rapidly spreading across the guy's muscular bodies. Each one looked fuller and more developed, more defined. They looked like they had gotten testosterone therapy that really worked. <br />
<br />
 Then the changes that would make them what Dan had envisoned began. Legs started to taper while hoofs formed from toes and feet. More legs sprouted out of their bodies as their rumps expanded. Smooth coats of hair began to cover everything below their waistes and sheathes formed around their large cocks and balls. In every respect, the were becoming something much grander and more beautiful then they would have ever imagined.  <br />
<br />
 Nick shook his head and smiled in glee. Dan let out a loud wolf-whistle. &quot;Yesiree, Nicky my boy, this is just how I wanted them to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
 The groaning and cracking noises had ceased. The whole team let out<br />
one last orgasmic sigh. There was a brief silence. Much to Nick's pleased amazement, the locker room was now filled with a superb variety of Plow-Horse Centaur Studs. Each one as beautiful as the other studs surrounding him.<br />
  <br />
<br />
“I must admit, you’ve outdone yourself Dan.” Nick was getting noticeably hard.<br />
<br />
“It’s all in a good day's work, Nick.” Dan chuckled while he eye Nick's growing member. <br />
<br />
 Nick had expected to see the guys check out their new<br />
bodies in amazement. After all, such an incredible change shouldn't go unnoticed.  But instead, the whole team acted as if nothing had changed at all. Of course, they did enjoy their new bodies.(The sensual pleasures of being a Centaur never wear off. Once one, you would never tire of the body's benefits. Boredom was something no Centaur ever experienced.)<br />
<br />
 Matt and Paul were making out like their lips were glued together.<br />
<br />
 Across the room, a black-haired stud named Juan, dug his shape so much that he actually sat down in an effort to make his mouth meet his member, but it was a little difficult for him. In the process of sitting he smashed a wooden bench. But its collapse left no impression on his great, strong equine body. <br />
<br />
 Billy was so excited by what he witnessed Jaun doing that he decided  he’d help him out. He went over and started licking the tip of Juan's gorgeous equipment. Juan returned the favor buy stroking Billy's meat. The two boded very quickly.<br />
<br />
 A group of taurs turned on the showers and started doing every manner of imaginable sex position and some that weren't so easy to imagine, too. Soon the shower stall was thick with steam and semen.<br />
<br />
 To sum it all up, the team was all over each other, except for one stud called Greg, who watched his hot centaur friends from an objective distance.<br />
<br />
 “I wonder why Greg isn’t joining in the fun?” Nick said. “He’s looking mighty hot, and so is that hard-on he’s spoting. Maybe he just needs a little pushing.You mind if I go over there to help him out?”<br />
<br />
 “No problem,” said Dan. “Give it your best shot.”<br />
<br />
 Nick donned a lascivious smiled, and went off to connect with the glorious Greg. Just before he got to him, a man opened the locker<br />
room door. It was Mr. Lucas. The whole team stopped and stood stock still  in the middle of their sensual, sexual scene.<br />
<br />
 “Uh-oh,” Nick said to himself. “We’re in trouble now.”<br />
<br />
 But to Nick’s surprise, Mr. Lucas had a broad smile on his face.<br />
<br />
 “Hey guys,” the science teacher said in good cheer. “How did practice go?”<br />
<br />
 “Unbelievable, Mr. L!” Matt exclaimed. <br />
<br />
 “That’s the spirit! You ‘taurs will be at the championship in no time! There isn't another team like you guys in the whole conference. I’ll see you all in class. Have fun!” <br />
<br />
<br />
 “Hey, Mr. L?” It was Greg. “How about I give you a lift to the science lab?”<br />
Mr. Lucas showed off his winning smile again. His lines around his eyes crinkled and the eyes themselves sparkled. “That’d be great, Greg.”<br />
<br />
<br />
 Mr. L hopped onto Greg’s back. “Wow Greg, have you been working out? Your back muscles are outstanding!” Dan giggled as he noticed the fabric of Mr. Lucas' pants puffing out as a large bulge appeared at his crotch.<br />
<br />
 Greg strode out of the locker room and into the hallway, heading for the science lab as he’d promised. His big black hoofs clopped against the wooden floor. Nick smiled as the centaur and his rider trotted away.<br />
<br />
 “Mr. Lucas is so hot it’s almost too good to be true,” Dan said to himself.<br />
<br />
 Indeed, Mark Lucas had always been an exceptionally fine-looking man.<br />
He looked like a soap star, and his terrific, charming personality only matched his looks. He was that rare commodity: a beautiful man who also was an all-around nice guy.There was no doubt about it, Mr. Lucas was<br />
everyone’s favorite teacher.<br />
<br />
 “Hey Nick, come over here.” Dan motioned to his faun friend.<br />
<br />
 “Aww, do I have to?” Nick complained, in the whiniest voice that he could pull off. “I wanna stay a little longer. Please?”<br />
<br />
 Dan rolled his eyes. “Fine! You can stay here and have fun with the stud-taurs for a while. I’ll see you soon.”<br />
<br />
 “Where are you going anyway?” Now, Nicks curiousity was piqued. He was torn between staying in the testosterone charged locker room or going with Dan.<br />
<br />
“The science lab.” Dan said smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! On second thought . . . &quot;</p>
