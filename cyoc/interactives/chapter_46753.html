<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'll go with a fox costume, please&quot; You say now getting over your uneasiness.<br />
<br />
The shop-keep looks about, mumbles something and disappears into another room. Returning he tosses a red and white costume to you.<br />
<br />
You hold out the costume out in front of you, which looks like it is a real anthropomorphic fox. Down the back of it you can see a zipper, which seems really wrong on this costume. You stop as you notice the six teats on the fur stomach down to the female genitalia.<br />
<br />
Glancing back at the shop-keep you ask, &quot;Is this all there is? This looks like a vixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shop-keep looks at you and nods and says, &quot;Sorry, but it's all we have. I sincerely hope your, err hem, girlfriend won't be to disappointed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and hope that Jack wont be disappointed. Looking on the bright side, you thought to yourself, &quot;Who knows, maybe Jack in bisexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing silently, you look back at the costume and ask, &quot;Don't you think this is kinda small?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll fit you like a glove. All costumes are guaranteed to be a one size fits all.&quot; the shop-keep says with an odd smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; You ask as you struggle with the costume's zipper.<br />
<br />
The shop-keep suddenly develops an act of seriousness and says &quot;This is 'The Second Skin'. These aren't just costumes, their second skins. It actually becomes your skin as you are in it. Keep going, it will fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, you finally unzip the back and attempt to step into the costume. It has a real odd sensation to it as you slid your legs and feet into the legs and feet of the vixen costume. As you do your legs feel like they have started to shrink as you struggle to get the costume up to your waist. All of a sudden you feel a tingling sensation of pleasure as you feel your penis come into contact with the costume's female genitalia. The real odd thing was that you never removed your pants when you started. You look down at you vixen genitalia as the shop-keep come up behind you and starts to pull the costume up to your shoulders. As the costume reaches your shoulders, you automatically put out your arms and slip them into the vixens front arms and paws. The last act is to put the mask on over your head. Then you take a look into the mirror that the shop-keep wheels in front of you.<br />
<br />
What you see is a five foot three tall fox with long flowing red head hair and emerald green eyes balancing, with some difficultly, on her hind paws complete with six erect teats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great Ceasers Ghost,&quot; you yelp!<br />
<br />
&quot;It is truly a fine costume.&quot; boasts the shop-keep.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's great!&quot; you bark a second time as your right paw slowly drifts across your erect teats.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be careful with....&quot; begins the shop-keep, but your paw has drifted toward your vagina and you attempt to start masturbating.<br />
<br />
The shop-keep shakes his head and says, &quot;Quit that! Now, there's a small problem with a lot of these costumes. Here, remove the costume and you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
With some difficulty you manage to take the costume off. When it gets down to your waist you hear a tearing noise. Looking down you see a hole in the costume where the vixen's genitalia were located. The next thing you see is that you still have the genitalia of the vixen instead of your own penis and testicles. As the costumes comes off the rest of the way, you notice that your pants are missing. Looking at the mirror you see that you've shrunk and now stand five foot three.<br />
<br />
The shop-keep breathes deeply and then says, &quot;The costumes have a problem of intensifying your sex drive. With this upped sex drive, it starts to makes you a little like the second skin. Before you know it, you start to transform and your first skin is replaced by the second skin. Don't be alarmed, the clitoris, clitoris hood, Labia Major and Minor, the female urethra, and the vagina will revert back to normal. Just keep from masturbating and you'll notice it will be gone in a day. Though some people like to keep it for a few weeks after they purchase the costume. As for the rest, any sex is fair play for transformations, oral, anal, female and&quot; The clerk smiles coyly at you, &quot;Male.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile back and say,&quot;Is it alright if I wear the costume out of the store?&quot;  The shop-keep chuckles and says,&quot;No problem.&quot;  Thankfully you had on baggy clothes when you came in. You quickly get into the costume and put your shirt on over it.<br />
<br />
As you are about to leave the changing area you look at your reflection in the mirror, you see an anthro vixen with an oversize male shirt on and nothing else.  You realize you are a young woman and you don't know what you were thinking trying to leave half naked, it might have been alright if I had pants but i don't.  You look for the shop-keep and ask him if you can borrow some clothes.  He says sure these things happen all the time, and he keeps some extra clothes.  He finds you a green slope necked blouse and a pair of female jeans.  You put them on but you realize there is no place for your wallet and stuff to go.  You ask if he might possibly have a purse back there also, he thinks about it a moment and tells you he does and goes to get it.  He returns with a small clutch purse.  He tells you it is a special purse, it always has what you need in it and you can fit anything into it.  <br />
<br />
Thinking about wallets and purses and stuff you remember that your drivers license won't match what you look like now.  You ask the clerk about that and he says to put you wallet and stuff into the purse and try to take them out again.  You do and your ratty old male wallet comes out as a used but still in good condition female wallet.  You open it up to look at your ID and it has your new face on it smiling for the camera.  It also has a new name, it says your first name is Vicky though your last name is the same.  You think to yourself that is not right, my name is Vin..,Vin..,Vicky.  Trying to think Vince but you couldn't even think that name.  Worse yet as soon as you thought the words, &quot;My name is Vicky,&quot; all of Vicky's memories start flooding in pushing Vince's to the side.  You remember growing up as a fox-girl in the country, you remember your prom, you remember moving to the big city, you remember your luck at finding  the apartment with Jack as your roommate (you knew right away he was gay),..., you remember the costume party you will be late for if you don't find a costume and get back home so you and Jack can go to it!<br />
<br />
You open your eyes and look around the shop for the first time.  You look at the shop-keeper and say,&quot;Pardon me, but do you have a 'Red Riding Hood' costume?  My roommate is going as the 'Big Bad Wolf' and I thought we might go as a set.&quot;  He says,&quot;No problem ma'am, I have Human suits in back for just such an occasion.  I just need a paw print for ID and funds transfer.&quot;  You hold out your paw and press it into the sensor plate he held out.  It beeps a couple times and turns green at the top.  The shop-keep says,&quot;Thank you I'll just be a minute,&quot; and goes in the back.  As he goes into the back you think to yourself, WOW, he is a cute cat morph. <br />
<br />
He comes out a few minutes later with a plain cardboard box.  He says,&quot;Everything is in here, clothes and all.  Just remember not to leave it on overnight and you should be fine.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You thank him and leave the store.  You rush to your car you can't wait to try on your costume and see what Jack says.  You get to the parking lot and search for your car, you can't seem to find it.  You reach into your purse for your keys, and come up with an unfamiliar set.  You hit the fob to unlock the doors.  The car next to you beeps, for a minute you don't recognize it, then you remember you and your dad going to the car lot and picking out the Volkswagen Beetle five years before.  You think to yourself I don't know how I could have forgotten my beloved Bug.  You get in and put the package on the passengers seat and head for home.</p>
