<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blaring of her phone&#39;s alarm pulled Kimberly abruptly from her dreams. Sticking an arm out from under the covers she reached out towards her phone that rested on her bedside table. Shutting the annoying sounds off she paused, groggily peering at her hand. Kimberly quickly came fully awake and sat up, throwing the covers off.<br />
<br />
Holding her hands in front of herself, she saw they were back to normal. The light blue nail polish had vanished, she noticed the faint scar near her wrist she got from crashing her bike as a kid was back. Overall her hands didn&#39;t look quite so smooth and dainty as before either. These were definitely the arms she remembered, and the fact that she could comfortably fit them in front of her revealed that her bust had diminished to it&#39;s usual size. She looked farther down her body. Her Alice costume was gone, she found herself back in her RHCP shirt and jeans, with her plain white socks adorning her feet. <br />
Reaching atop her head she felt around for the headband, but it was gone. It looked as if the wizard had been true to his word. She felt a slight emptiness now that the aura of pleasure that the changes had brought had faded from her completely. Or had it? Kimberly curled her toes and rubbed her feet together experimentally. She was rewarded with an enjoyable and faintly pleasurable sensation. She wondered if it was a leftover from the headband&#39;s magics, or if she had just ignored any such inclination of pleasure from them in the past. <br />
<br />
She smiled to herself. Either way, she thought, cracking a toe and feeling a small, blissful jolt escape the joint. I&#39;ll certainly enjoy it now. <br />
<br />
She checked her phone again. It was nearly 7 A.M.! She&#39;d better get herself ready, she said she and Sarah would leave at 8 to pick up her friends for the trip. Quickly hopping up from her bed, she padded to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Flipping on the lights and standing in front of the mirror, Kimberly Bowen took a good look at herself. While, not the storybook girl she had been last night, the face staring back at her certainly wasn&#39;t bad. Her amber eyes and freckled face stared back at her, framed by chestnut brown locks that were suffering from some serious bed head.<br />
<br />
Looking down at her body she saw the counter top was back at the level she was used to, which meant she must back to her respectable height of 5&#39;8&quot;. She looked over her slim frame. Kimberly didn&#39;t do much in the way of exercise and so didn&#39;t have the tone figure many women her age sought dearly. Kim patted her thin midsection. Thankfully her love of sweets and non-athletic lifestyle hadn&#39;t translated into extra weight. Not that she was a total stick figure, she liked her perky B-Cup breasts and the small but pert derriere that she possessed. All in all she liked how cute she was, though she did enjoy having an hourglass figure, if only for one night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; she said, &quot;guess I&#39;m back to being myself again.&quot; A small smile graced her features, &quot;For now at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly showering then throwing on some light makeup, Kimberly went out to double check that all her stuff was packed for the trip. On her desk, sitting next to the magic box, was a small rolled up scroll and wrapped parcel. Walking over and unrolling the scroll, Kimberly saw it was a letter written in a flowing script. She began to read:<br />
<br />
Dear Mistress Bowen,<br />
<br />
I hope that you enjoyed your first foray into transformation. Do have fun on your trip with your friends, the Box is quite a unique item. Do heed my words of warning from before however; Do not let you or any of your friends attempt to try using more than one of the Box&#39;s transformative items at a time. While some items could pair harmlessly or even favorably, the risk of highly negative transformations is quite high.<br />
<br />
With best wishes,<br />
Paldinoss <br />
<br />
P.S. Also I have left a minor enchanted item for you. No cost! Just found them while cleaning.<br />
<br />
Excitedly, Kimberly put down the scroll and tore open the simple package. Her face fell slightly as she beheld a pair of plain white cotton socks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; she said aloud. She looked back at the note the wizard had given her and then back at the socks. Well, he did say they were enchanted, she thought.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the socks and sitting down on her bed, she pulled them over her feet.<br />
<br />
They came to just below her ankle and were quite comfortable. Not quite as soft as the stockings last night, but better than any pair she owned. She rubbed her feet across the floor and was rewarded with pleasurable tingling, more intense than when she had woken up this morning. Humming slightly in content, she cast her mind towards the socks. They felt nice, but they just seemed like regular socks.<br />
Those toe stockings last night were fun at least, she thought grumpily. I thought these were magical? <br />
Just as the thought passed, the socks slowly began tightening around her toes, separating them out until she had on a perfectly fitting pair of white toe socks. Still focusing on them she gasped as their color turned even whiter, the fabric shifting to be as soft as silk as they stretched up out of sight beneath her jeans. In moments they were up around her thighs, now fully the same socks from her Alice getup. <br />
<br />
She curled her toes and giggled at the sensation of the soft fabric rubbing between them and hugging her soles perfectly. She shouldn’t take any item that had come from the wizard at face value. <br />
<br />
She spent a couple minutes messing with them, changing them from normal socks, to toe socks, to thigh-high tabi socks and back, and trying out different patterns, materials, and colors. Eventually she settled on no-show blue and white striped toe socks. Satisfied, Kimberly threw on a white tank top, a pair of black ankle-length leggings, a denim jacket, and her white, high-top Vans sneakers.<br />
<br />
Kimberly spent the next few minutes moving all her bags to the front door, before sitting down on the couch in the common area. Kim let the other two girls know that she and Sarah would be there in half an hour. She flipped on the TV, her rubbing toes absentmindedly against the canvas of her sneakers and waited for her roommate to come out.</p>
