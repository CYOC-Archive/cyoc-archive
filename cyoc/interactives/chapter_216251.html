<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luckily - at least for him - Anicetus didn&#39;t have to wait too long to get Devin alone. A few minutes after entering their suite, Garret bounded back out full of excitement, with his parents in tow behind him, leaving only the eldest son of the family in the suite. Anicetus ducked behind a pillar and grinned, and as soon as the rest of the Marshalls were around the corner and out of sight he opened the door and let himself in - having access to all guests&#39; rooms, as befitting his godly status.<br />
<br />
Devin groaned dramatically as he flopped backwards onto his bed. Of course Garret had wanted to go explore as soon as possible, and of course his parents dropped everything and immediately agreed to whatever their golden boy wanted. Devin himself had just barely managed to get out of it, claiming to be too tired with jetlag. Tired of his annoying geek of a brother, more like. The one consolation was managing to snag some alone time. He opened his phone, looking to scroll his friends&#39; Instagrams or find funny TikToks - and then groaned even louder as he quickly realized that the resort had no internet service. God, what was he supposed to *do* all week? At least he had some porn saved on his phone. He scrolled to it and had just unzipped his pants when he suddenly heard a voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome!&quot; There was some kid standing in the doorway, dressed in some sort of Greek costume, smiling and waving at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Devin grumbled, scrambling to zip himself up and standing off the bed. &quot;Uh, hi. Can I help you with something...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid laughed brightly, as if Devin had said something hilarious. &quot;No, silly, *I&#39;m* here to help *you*! My name is Anicetus. I... work here, you could say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, word?&quot; Devin raised an eyebrow, a bit skeptically. This kid seemed too young to have a job, but he guessed things worked differently around here. It wouldn&#39;t be the weirdest thing he&#39;d already seen at this weird-ass resort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, word,&quot; Anicetus smiled placidly. He no longer understood the modern slang he&#39;d known as Derrick, but he was willing to play along. &quot;Is there anything I can get for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Devin snorted, considering as he sat back down on the bed. &quot;A different brother, maybe,&quot; he grumbled, half to himself.<br />
<br />
Anicetus&#39; grin widened. This was going better than he could have ever hoped for! &quot;I can certainly get you a different brother! Any requests?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot; Devin was confused. It was clearly a joke, he didn&#39;t know why the kid was taking it seriously. I mean, what was he gonna do, find him a new brother? But what the hell, he might as well play along. &quot;Uh, well. One who likes the same stuff as me, I guess, not a boring nerd like Garret who&#39;s only into school and whatever. One who&#39;s *fun*, y&#39;know? Chill. A brother I can just hang with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anicetus nodded enthusiastically. &quot;You&#39;ll certainly like the same things as your new brother, and you&#39;ll certainly have a lot of fun with him! Neither of us have ever even *been* to school. Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Devin failed to catch the &#39;us&#39; at the end there, and instead, feeling surprisingly open around this weird kid, moped, &quot;One who our parents don&#39;t prefer to me, I guess. Who I won&#39;t have to play second-best to all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anicetus put a hand on Devin&#39;s shoulder reassuringly. &quot;I promise, you and your new brother will be *exactly* the same in the eyes of your parents - and everyone else, for that matter!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess,&quot; Devin mumbled, blushing a little at showing such vulnerability to a stranger.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, shall I take you to your new brother now?&quot; Anicetus asked, abruptly and excitedly, sticking out a hand for Devin to take - for the change to take hold, Devin had to agree to it, even if he didn&#39;t have to know just *what* he was agreeing to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Devin didn&#39;t understand. It was just a short, entirely hypothetical conversation, and now this kid was acting like there really was a brand new brother really waiting for him? Was this some kind of game, or scam? Fuck it, he figured, he might as well see where this was going, and it&#39;s not like he had anything else to do in this stupid, boring, wifi-less resort. &quot;Yeah, okay. Sure.&quot; He stood up and and took Anicetus by the hand, and suddenly everything started to change. <br />
<br />
Anicetus’ hand was suddenly glowing and hot as the sun, and Devin, startled, tried to pull away but was held tighter than should have been possible in the young godling’s grip as Anicetus’ divine essence streamed into him and flooded his being. The room seemed to swim and swell around him as he plummeted down in height by over a foot, growing shorter to match his soon-to-be-twin but remaining as well-proportioned as a classical sculpture. His impressive football player’s muscles dwindled away, bulky beef melting into a lean, lithe layer of well-defined wiriness that left him with an odd feeling of being agile and light on his feet in contrast to the plodding heaviness he was used to. <br />
<br />
Any trace of body hair evaporated, leaving him perfectly smooth as marble, while the hair on his head grew out in curls and lightened, going from a short ginger near-buzzcut to a tress of platinum-blonde curls just like Anicetus’. He gave an uncharacteristically high-pitched yelp as his balls shrank and ascended back towards his body, while his pride and joy, the seven-inch cock he had used to plow many a cheerleader, retracted like a tape measure, reaching a demure and even cute three inches as he crossed back to the other side of puberty.<br />
<br />
“Wha-” Devin tried to squeak in confusion as he looked at Anicetus, but now Anicetus’ eyes were glowing bright gold too and he couldn’t help but get lost in them. That same brightness lit up inside his mind, a giggle escaping him as his too-cool-for-school teenaged sullenness and cynicism was burned away by childish eagerness and playfulness and mischief. He didn’t want to just mope around his room jerking off, he wanted to run and jump and frolic and have fun, to play games and pranks, to see new things and meet new people and play with them! He knew just how to play with them too, gaining the knowledge of magic, how to transform them into different people or creatures or even objects, starting to view mortal humans as little more than bright shiny toys for his amusement.<br />
<br />
Wait, mortal humans? But then what was he? He was confused for a moment, before the answer struck him like one of his grandfather Zeus’ thunderbolts: he was a god, of course! A divine and immortal member of the Greek pantheon, just like his brother Anicetus and his mother Hebe and his father Heracles. The powers and abilities that came with his divinity, from speaking Greek to flight and teleportation to changing his and others’ forms at will, were as second nature to him as breathing was to a human. He still remembered being Devin, remembered his human school and sports and friends and families, his brother Garret first and foremost, but those memories were dulling if not fading, retreating to the back of his mind. An utterly average, 19-year suburban jock life seemed boring and hard to care about in the face of the budding memories of a centuries-long childhood amidst the many wonders and pleasures of Olympus with his twin by his side, Anicetus and Alexiares, Alexiares and Anicetus.<br />
<br />
That was him: Alexiares! Devin seemed like a weird and boring dream. He was really Alexiares, son of Heracles and godling of youth, just like his twin. Alexiares’ own eyes flared with the same bright golden light as Anicetus as he settled into his new identity and divinity, before the light died down and their eyes returned to normal - Anicetus a bright blue and Alexiares an equally bright green, both glimmering with mischief, the color of their eyes the only physical difference between the otherwise identical boys, lithe and handsome with adorable blonde curls, seemingly twelve years old despite their true age and power. Even Devin&#39;s human clothes had somehow shifted into a gold-trimmed white tunic and sandals exactly matching Anicetus&#39;.<br />
<br />
Anicetus leapt for joy, beamed happily, and hugged Alexiares with childish but sincere and eager affection. “Welcome, brother!”<br />
<br />
Alexiares beamed right back and hugged Anicetus just as eagerly and affectionately. “Thanks, brother! That was fun!”<br />
<br />
Finally, Anicetus released him and playfully shoved his shoulder. “So whaddya wanna do now, Alex?” he called him by his nickname, already setting into a familiar routine, and familial dynamic, as if they hadn’t just become brothers seconds ago.<br />
<br />
Alexiares thought back to his human memories, remembering how boring his human family had seemed, especially his old brother Garret. Now that he had the powers of a god, he could make them more fun! He grinned mischievously at his new brother. “I think I have some ideas, Ani...”</p>
