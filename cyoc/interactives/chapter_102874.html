<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the most part, Samantha Twist was one happy and contented married lesbian werecat. Her wife Frances had practically waited on her hand and paw since they got out of the bathtub. All over fur massages, followed by more intimate pleasures only two women could share together. Frances even fixed every meal and served her in bed. But Samantha was starting to get bored with all the pampering and gently told her so.<br />
&quot;Did I do something wrong honey?&quot; asked Frances with concern in her voice, as she cuddled up next to Samantha.<br />
&quot;No dear. Our time together was great. It always is. I just want to do more,&quot; said Samantha, holding Frances close to her.<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; wondered Frances, while stroking the furry valley between Samantha&#39;s breasts.<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s still the grocery shopping and the laundry that needs to be taken care of,&quot; she suggested.<br />
&quot;That can wait. Besides, who said you&#39;d be needing any clothes this weekend?&quot; asked Frances in return, as she moved her tail to start caressing the more intimate spots between her wife&#39;s thighs.<br />
&quot;OOOOOOHHHHH....&quot; purred Samantha, for Frances knew just where to be at any given moment to excite her.<br />
When she came down off her momentary sexual high, Samantha turned to her wife and said, &quot;If this is still about Thanksgiving, I&#39;m long past that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Frances. &quot;I never meant to hurt you, and would do anything I could to take my experiment back if I could.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know darling. But you&#39;re forgetting something very important. We&#39;re not only life partners, we&#39;re a team as well,&quot; said Samantha, as she turned over so she was laying on top of Frances, with her breasts rubbing against her wife&#39;s. &quot;But above all else: equals. You&#39;ve been bending over backwards to please me, and while I&#39;ve enjoyed the attention, now it&#39;s your turn,&quot; she added, before kissing Frances.<br />
Soon Frances felt her wife rubbing their vaginas together, the space between getting wetter and stickier even as Samantha started massaging Frances&#39; breasts while tonguing and sucking on the nipples.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before they experienced a mind blowing orgasm together, but even as Frances started to calm down, Samantha gave her a mischievous smile as she started rubbing their cunts together once more. The sensations and friction even greater now from all the lubrication of the previous effort.<br />
Frances started to purr and moan in ecstasy as Samantha said, &quot;After this we&#39;ll take another bath, but this time you&#39;re leaning against me as I bathe you darling.&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>ANYTHING</i> you want my love,&quot; promised Frances, as she experienced another wonderful orgasm.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The last thing Evan Lawson remembered before falling back asleep was burying the top knot of his lupine penis deep into his sexy wife&#39;s ass as Maggie Lawson screamed out in pleasure.<br />
The fact that he awoke alone because she still had to work that Saturday after Thanksgiving didn&#39;t bother him.<br />
The fact that the digital clock radio on the night stand said it was after 3 in the afternoon did.<br />
After shifting back from werewolf to his human form, Evan took a quick shower and put on some fresh clothes. Their bedroom still smelled like hot sex, a scent that he didn&#39;t mind and hoped to add to once Maggie came home from work for the night.<br />
Yet as he started down the stairs to raid the kitchen for something to eat, Evan Lawson knew something was amiss.<br />
The door to his private study was open, and the only time it should have been was when he was in there but didn&#39;t mind being disturbed.<br />
Halfway down the staircase, he heard his daughter Spencer shout &quot;OH NO!&quot;, which made him leap into action, literally.<br />
Evan jumped from mid-flight and landed right in front of the open door. Considering it was daylight outside, he wasn&#39;t about to change back into his fursona (and tear apart the clothes he had on) until he knew what was going on.<br />
But the sight before him left Evan scratching his head.<br />
Her boyfriend Eric Anderson and Spencer were sitting across from each other at his desk, playing chess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you did it again,&quot; complained Spencer, as she moved to reset the board.<br />
&quot;Err, what&#39;s going on in here?&quot; Evan demanded to know as he walked into the study.<br />
&quot;Hi dad,&quot; said Spencer, briefly looking up to acknowledge him. &quot;Eric and I have been playing chess.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see that. But what are you doing in my study to begin with?&quot;<br />
&quot;We got bored with the TV and Eric&#39;s computer tablet needed recharging, so we couldn&#39;t play chess on his app, so we came in here. Mom said it was okay before she left for work,&quot; explained his daughter.<br />
&quot;The two of you have been doing that the whole time?&quot; asked Evan. &quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot;<br />
&quot;So far? Eric, three straight,&quot; grumpily complained Spencer, while sticking her tongue out at her boyfriend.<br />
&quot;THREE?&quot; repeated Evan in disbelief. The best he had ever done against Spencer was 50/50. While he had a military background and the strategy to go with it, his daughter was far more intelligent than she let on sometimes, which made them evenly matched on the marble battlefield, as he referred to the playing surface of his die-cast pewter figurine Medieval chess set.<br />
&quot;Well, let me go get something to eat and I&#39;ll play you a game Eric, unless you had other plans?&quot; asked Evan, staring at the two of them. With her arm still in a sling until the scheduled X-rays Sunday morning, Spencer was still in her hybrid were wolf/cat fursona, and was only wearing another of her father&#39;s extra large pullover sweat shirts.<br />
There were no sexual scents that Evan could detect except from him and his wife drifting down from upstairs, but since Eric was still a normal (for the moment) better safe than sorry.<br />
&quot;No plans. But do you mind bringing me back something to drink sir?&quot; Eric asked politely.<br />
&quot;Me too, if you don&#39;t mind dad,&quot; said Spencer.<br />
&quot;Okay. Break out the coasters and I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can,&quot; promised her father, as he headed off into the kitchen to raid the fridge.<br />
<br />
But when they were alone, Eric got out of his chair and approached his girlfriend.<br />
&quot;Okay honey,&quot; he whispered sexily into her ear. &quot;That&#39;s three blow jobs you owe me, plus I get to be on top the first time we can have sex after I become a were.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know Slugger. But you better keep your promise of giving me an ear massage while I&#39;m blowing you. EACH time,&quot; Spencer reminded him. Since finding out that her ears were an erogenous zone, Spencer couldn&#39;t wait for Eric to touch them, although nothing ever happened when she tried it herself.<br />
&quot;You better believe it my love,&quot; promised Eric, before licking the furry edge of the one closest to him, which actually made Spencer shudder.<br />
Then he sat back down and they waited for her father to return.</p>
