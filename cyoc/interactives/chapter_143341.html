<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edwin and Gabriela, resigning themselves to their fates as children, decided to leave the remains of the Chronivac be, choosing to play on the swings instead. The urge to be a child, Edwin soon learned, was much stronger for Gabriela than it was for him, most likely due to the larger age change. She would squeal loudly in delight at the simplest things, as long as they&#39;re fun. And yet, to Edwin at least, it only made her all the more enjoyable to be around.<br />
<br />
Soon recess was over, and the teacher supervising the kids called them all inside, Edwin and Gabriela following suit as they began to talk with each other animatedly, a friendship sparking between the two newly made children. Not a single iota of attention was paid to the fizzeled remains of the Chronivac, however, which would prove to be a large mistake....<br />
<br />
Around 30 minutes after everyone was back inside, the remains of the Chronivac emitter that Gabriela had so cleanly snapped in two were beginning to give off energy, the transformative machine beginning to repair itself. However, its new structure was unstable in the fact that it would now enact random changes onto the world around it, starting with the school just a few yards away from it.<br />
______________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabriela!&quot; Mr. Gonzalez, still the new teacher once the children had come back in, cried out in frustration as yet another ball of paper hit his head. &quot;If you don&#39;t stop, it&#39;s straight to the principal&#39;s office for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriela only giggled alongside Edwin as the teacher&#39;s face turned as red as a tomato. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll stop now!&quot; She said, seemingly satisfying the teacher as he turned around and continued the lesson. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really gonna stop?&quot; Edwin whispered, not so quietly in fact, into Gabriela&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you thin-&quot; Gabriela stopped, feeling funny as she dropped the wad of paper she was currently holding, the crumpled object falling onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Gabriela, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Edwin tried to ask, before he got hit by the same feeling as well, one reminiscent of the pulsating feeling of the Chronivac. In fact, scratch reminiscent, this was exactly like the Chronivac!<br />
<br />
One look at Gabriela and Edwin knew she was feeling the same thing. Unbeknownst to them, the Chronivac was currently entering quite a few changes and enacting them into the school, sending a wave of pulsating white energy right at the building. Edwin and Gabriela seemed to be the only ones who felt it and they closed their eyes, letting the changes happen.<br />
<br />
Edwin could literally feel himself aging, the bones in his body creaking as they lengthened and became more sturdy. His spine lengthened, causing him to grow taller by the minute, hormones related to puberty beginning to pump throughout his body. The changes were now beginning to feel pleasurable for Edwin as his voice grew deeper and deeper, as he let put moans, his penis growing larger, his erection tenting his pants.<br />
<br />
Gabriela could feel herself undergoing similar changes as well, her body growing taller as well, albeit not as tall as Edwin&#39;s but still enough to be a large departure from her former size. Her body began to rapidly mature as well, her voice becoming slightly deeper as she let out pleasurable moans, her breasts filling out to perky C-Cups. Her hips and ass filled out, as things around the two of them changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Mr. Dias, can you please tell me what you do when confronted with an error in your program?&quot; Edwin could hear a new voice ask, as he groggily shook his head. He found himself in a seat in a lecture hall, one like he imagined college would be like. Gabriela was next to him, passed out, her eyebrows furrowed for some reason. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Dias?&quot; Edwin looked towards the voice with a start, seeing an older woman at the front, evidently teaching the class. Looking over himself, he found himself aged immensely, past the age he started out with back when he found the Chronivac. His body told him that he was 20 right now. But....<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Gonzalez?&quot; Edwin hesitantly said, getting an inkling on what exactly had changed. Unfortunately, Ms. Gonzalez wasn&#39;t exactly having it, evident by her contorted face and the giggles of the other students around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you think this is funny?&quot; She screamed shrilly, despite Edwin&#39;s efforts to protest. &quot;Get out until you&#39;re ready to come back, and take your amnesiac girlfriend with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin reluctantly got up, but was still confused as to who was his girlfriend was, until his eyes landed on Gabriela and widened. New memories flooded into his head, him asking her out, their first date, the day they made it official, and the day they both got accepted to this college. Edwin then stirred Gabriela awake, causing her to blink a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Edwin...?&quot; She started, groggy and confused, much like he was initially. She stumbled a bit as Edwin got her up, but the two talked out of the door, with a few awws from the other students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabriela, you&#39;ve gotta tell me how much you remember, allright?&quot; Edwin said, once the two were in the hallway and out of earshot. &quot;Something&#39;s not right about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I remember being a 37 year old teacher... and then you changed me into a kid..&quot; She started, taking the time to pout at Edwin when she said that. &quot;And then.....&quot; Her eyes widened, getting the same memories Edwin was getting. &quot;You...  and..... I?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin blushed, looking away. Unfortunately, his new memories brought along a love for Gabriela he had never really felt with anyone else. However, he wasn&#39;t sure Gabriela felt the same. &quot;L-Listen, I think this was the Chronivac...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Gabriela asked, bringing herself to stand on her own, coming out of her memories. &quot;But...  I broke it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s broken...&quot; Edwin said rubbing the bridge of his nose. &quot;I overlooked it at the time, but back before I got the  Chronivac, I studied the device in and out. If a certain piece isn&#39;t broken, it&#39;ll just rebuild itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, someone got it and is doing this to us?&quot; Gabriel asked, suddenly becoming frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Edwin corrected, calming her down. &quot;It&#39;s a bit.... different from that. See, the device then becomes unstable... and begins to change everything and everyone randomly...&quot;</p>
