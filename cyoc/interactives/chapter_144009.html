<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day started very, very weird. It was the morning of February 18, 2065, when Nami and Regina woke up and overheard everyone excitedly murmuring about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Regina asked one of the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;They gave us underwear!&quot; She answered, heading back into the dressing room.<br />
<br />
Nami and Regina stepped in to check it out, and indeed, the girls were all brandishing articles of clothing heretofore unseen. The group had been wearing nothing but multi-colored tent dresses with no underwear up to this point, and everyone seemed excited to have something to wear underneath. Each person looked through drawer, finding different items. One girl got five pairs of panties, one pair of socks and one bra. Another girl got several socks, a few panties and no bra.<br />
<br />
The panties were all classic-brief style, made of cotton and in several different colors. The bras were all &quot;t-shirt bras&quot;, also made of cotton and in much of the same colors. No girl got quite the same color combination. The socks were ankle-high, somewhat thin, cotton, but all in white.<br />
<br />
Nami and Regina were curious as they opened their own drawers... only to find nothing at all. They checked and double-checked every shelf, but only confirmed that they were completely empty.<br />
<br />
Then something stranger came up: some of the girls had gotten not only underwear in their drawers, but a new dress in their closet! They were all a-line dresses, made of silk and in various pastel colors. A total of nine girls received one of these in their closets, and each in a slightly different color.<br />
<br />
Confused, Nami started asking around the room, and found that only one other person&#39;s dresser and closet had remained empty. Her name was Natasha Blair, closet #19.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get why we were the three that didn&#39;t get anything...&quot; Natasha said, pinching the hem of her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever it is, it definitely has something to do with trying to get us turned into Feedees and Feeders.&quot; Regina said, crossing her arms and thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I get why you two wouldn&#39;t get anything.&quot; Natasha said, pointing to Nami and Regina. &quot;Neither of you guys ever ate the good food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... that&#39;s a good observation...&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t explain ME, though.&quot; Natasha whined.  &quot;I ate all the food I was supposed to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost every girl in the group was talking with one another, talking about the clothing they got and making trades. A blue bra was traded for a green bra; three pairs of socks were exchanged for a panty. One girl gave up all of her underwear in exchange for one of the new a-line dresses. Nothing these girls were wearing was particularly fashionable, but much better than most of what they could wear in the past. The trading they conducted made sure that more of them were happy with what they got. Most importantly, the introduction of underwear meant they didn&#39;t all have to get cold feet. Nor did they have to feel the air bristling up between their legs, nor deal with the aggravation of breasts free to the whims of gravity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; One girl said, approaching Nami, Regina and Natasha. &quot;Here. Have these.&quot; She said, handing them each a pair of panties. &quot;I got seven pairs myself, so I don&#39;t need them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina had noticed that this girl had only given up the more boring colors (Nami got white, while she and Natasha got gray,) but she wasn&#39;t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, UGH these are comfortable!&quot; Nami groaned, shaking her hips back and forth a few times after slipping the panties on. &quot;Aren&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I was pretty unnerved going commando all day.&quot; Regina replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to know why I didn&#39;t get anything in my dresser.&quot; Natasha said, upset.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
A half hour later, Mrs. Joseph entered the facility. She was met with glares just a little bit warmer than yesterday.<br />
&quot;Alright, everyone!&quot; She said after getting her &#39;good morning&#39;s out of the way. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all a little confused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Confused?&quot; Melissa shot back, standing up and taking her position in front of the director. &quot;About the dressing room, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep yep!&quot; Mrs. Joseph nodded. &quot;You all got new things to wear and enjoy, and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of us.&quot; Melissa interrupted. &quot;A few didn&#39;t get anything. None of us got the same things. What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Joseph smiled at her, and cleared her throat.<br />
&quot;...ahem. Allow me to show you.&quot; She said. She signaled for the entire group to huddle together. &quot;Do you remember this?&quot; She asked, turning on the electronic touch screen panel on the wall. A grid of security camera footage appeared on-screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. The thing where you guys all spy on us like a bunch of serious creepers.&quot; Melissa said, snidely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm, I understand if that&#39;s how you feel about it.&quot; Mrs. Joseph replied. She sat down on a little stool that was in front of the panel. &quot;I respect that, but let me show you, now, why we keep track of ya&#39;ll.&quot; She pressed a few more buttons. &quot;As you know, these cameras are observed by AI which track and catalog everything that you do.&quot; She turned around to face the group. &quot;...but do you want to guess what all this monitoring is for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...we probably get points for good behavior or something?&quot; Said the brash teenager who had been rooming with Melissa.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Joseph lit up.<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes exactly! Perfect guess!&quot; She signaled to give the girl a high-five. The girl refused to raise her hand, so Mrs. Joseph awkwardly moved her hand back to the panel. &quot;Okay... well anyway, take a look for yourself kids.&quot; She pressed a button, pulling up the &quot;Behavior points log,&quot; and then stood up and stepped back for everyone to see.<br />
<br />
Melissa stepped up first. She sat down at the stool, and saw that the log was set to &quot;February 17th.&quot;<br />
&quot;So this is the log from yesterday?&quot; Melissa asked, getting a nod from Mrs. Joseph. &quot;Okay... let&#39;s see how I did...&quot; She said, scrolling down until she found her name.<br />
<br />
She read her stats out loud:<br />
&quot;Melissa Cannon<br />
Age: 22<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;0&quot;<br />
Weight: 157 lbs<br />
Hair: dirty blond&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; She said, scrolling down a little further, seeing her statistics. &quot;It says I got 10 points for every time I ate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. 10 points per meal!&quot; Mrs. Joseph answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that makes sense, it says I got 30 points total for eating. I also got another 5 points for snacking, it says?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm! Every time you snack, you get points.&quot; Mrs. Joseph answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, I wonder what this is designed to make us want to do.&quot; Melissa said, toootally not being sarcastic. &quot;Heh, I lost 10 points for reading?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group started murmuring again, wondering why you would lose points for reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only read one of those books for like a half hour. Why&#39;d I lose points for that?&quot; Melissa asked. She turned to Mrs. Joseph, who seemed to be unwilling to answer. &quot;Okay, fine then, whatever... oh and hey, it says I got 20 points for watching TV?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group sounded a little bit excited, at the thought that watching TV accumulates points.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Melissa said, looking at the stats more carefully. &quot;It says I watched TV two different times, and got 10 points for each time. And uh.... UH OKAY.&quot; Melissa said, suddenly looking very uncomfortable and trying to swipe away from her statistics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, hey, what was that?&quot; Another one of the girls who was standing close by asked. She leaned in and swiped the screen back over to Melissa&#39;s stats. &quot;I wanna see what you&#39;re so embarrassed about...&quot; She looked down at the console. &quot;...masturbated: five points.&quot; She read aloud.<br />
<br />
The group giggled a little bit.<br />
<br />
Melissa groaned, and turned around.<br />
&quot;Mrs. Community Director Joseph Esquire the Third, why on God&#39;s green earth did I get points for masturbating??&quot; Melissa asked, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t you? It&#39;s normal and healthy.&quot; Mrs. Joseph answered, nodding politely. She was reveling in the giggles Melissa was receiving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, whatever.&quot; She said, running her hair behind her ear. &quot;Anyway, it says I got 50 points in total for yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Mrs. Joseph replied. She pointed at a specific part of the data. &quot;And as you can see, the system used those points to give you clothing. Panties, bras and socks are each worth 5 points, and that new dress you got is worth 30 points.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa did the math, and it came out like this:<br />
She got 50 points yesterday, and that was spent on:<br />
One pair of panties (-5)<br />
One bra (-5)<br />
Two pairs of socks (-10)<br />
A light-green a-line dress (-30)<br />
<br />
&quot;So like, if I... ugh... if I hadn&#39;t masturbated, I&#39;ve had only gotten 45 points, and then I would only have gotten one pair of socks?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably. I don&#39;t know quite how the system makes its decisions, but if you had gotten even fewer points, you wouldn&#39;t have gotten that dress you&#39;re wearing.&quot; Mrs. Joseph answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Well, interesting.&quot; Melissa stood up. &quot;Who wants to go next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I do!&quot; Said one girl who was nearby. This was the girl who had reached over to read the masturbation statistic a second ago. She sat nicely down in the stool--her first time sitting down since putting her new panties on--and scrolled around until she found her name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Irena Rosales Eller<br />
Age: 19<br />
Ethnicity: White Latin American<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 115 lbs<br />
Hair: dark brown<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, that&#39;s me!&quot; She said, performatively to the rest of the group. Nobody looked interested, so she just quickly read through her statistics.<br />
<br />
She had gotten 20 points for eating (10 for breakfast, 10 for dinner. She had skipped lunch.) She got another 5 points for snacking, and then received a whopping 40 points for watching TV (she watched most of the day.) This resulted in a total of 65 points. The data said that, for these 65 points, she received 1 panty, 5 bras, 1 pair of socks and 1 dress. She grumbled a little, wishing she had gotten fewer bras. She honestly wanted more socks than anything. It was no big deal, though, because she had traded some of her bras for a few socks earlier.<br />
<br />
One by one, each member of the group sat down to evaluate how they did. Eventually, Regina was next in line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regina Nash<br />
Age: 16<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 132 lbs<br />
Hair: light brown<br />
<br />
&quot;When did they weight me...?&quot; Regina thought to herself. Regardless, she kept reading. She assumed she was about to learn why she didn&#39;t get any underwear.<br />
<br />
The first thing she saw was:<br />
<br />
Took a shower (-20)<br />
<br />
&quot;What, really? I lost points for taking a shower?&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shit, that means I lost 20 points, too.&quot; Nami said, looking over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Regina continued to read what it said.<br />
<br />
Ate weak food (-10),(-10),(-10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Weak food? What does THAT mean?&quot; Nami asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see. It saw that I didn&#39;t eat any of the tasty food they wanted me to eat, and subtracted points for it. I did it for all three meals, so that&#39;s -30 points in total.&quot; Regina said, rubbing her chin. &quot;Funny that their word for it is &#39;weak&#39; food, instead of, you know, HEALTHY food.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Mixed standard food into weak food (-20)<br />
<br />
&quot;What?? What even is that??&quot; Nami gasped.<br />
<br />
It took the two of them a bit of thinking to figure out, but they realized it must have been referring to last night&#39;s dinner. Regina and the others had made their boring meals more enjoyable by putting a small, conservative amount of gravy and meat into their bowls.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would make sense that the system would subtract points for that.&quot; Regina said. &quot;Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t be nearly as tempted to get the fattening food. It&#39;s easy to get through a bowl of veggies with a little gravy or cheese on the side. They want to make it as difficult as possible to go for a middle-ground, you have to be either 100% unhealthy, or 100% healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Read literature (-10), (-10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s not surprising. I read for several hours yesterday.&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
Read comics (+5)<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nice, finally you GOT some points.&quot; Nami said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting... so it seems they want people to read, but only if it&#39;s got a lot of pictures.&quot; Regina speculated. &quot;Oh, and by the way, Nami...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhuh?&quot; Nami asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, like... I masturbated yesterday. So it&#39;s probably gonna say that on there.&quot; Regina said, avoiding eye contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, psh, no problem man.&quot; Nami shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay good. Thanks. I just wanted to say it before the screen showed it. Eheh...&quot; Regina blushed.<br />
<br />
Played video games (+10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Not surprising the system favors video games. My grandpa said video games and TV made people fat, even before the Hedonopocalypse.&quot; Regina said.<br />
<br />
Masturbated (+5)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re actually getting some points, now.&quot; Nami chuckled.<br />
<br />
Gossiped (+10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Regina rubbed her eyes. &quot;It counts stuff like that? What did I even gossip about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we were talking about other members of our group like, all day yesterday. Over at the &#39;healthy&#39; table, we were chatting up a storm about the others and their giant hamburgers.&quot; Nami answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hoh, I guess that makes sense.&quot; Regina said. &quot;That&#39;s crazy, though. This system not only wants you to be unhealthy, it wants you to be <i>emotionally</i> unhealthy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Total: -60<br />
Current balance: 0<br />
<br />
&quot;So in total, I got negative points. So yeah, makes sense I got nothing.&quot; Regina said, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means I got negative points, too.&quot; Nami said, sitting on the stool in her place, and found her own name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nam Ae-Cha (&quot;Nami&quot;)<br />
Age: 15<br />
Ethnicity: Korean<br />
Height: 5&#39;5&quot;<br />
Weight: 104 lbs<br />
Hair: black&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it even got your nickname?&quot; Regina said, realizing that these cameras must be picking up audio, as well.<br />
<br />
Nami&#39;s stats read pretty similarly to Regina&#39;s:<br />
<br />
Took a shower (-20)<br />
Ate weak food (-10), (-10), (-10)<br />
Mixed standard food into weak food (-20)<br />
Read comics (+5)<br />
Played video games (+10), (+10)<br />
Watched TV (+10), (+10)<br />
Gossiped (+10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I honestly feel like I gossiped all day.&quot; Nami said. &quot;But whatever, heh.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Total: -15<br />
Current balance: 0<br />
<br />
&quot;So I didn&#39;t get as low as you, but I still came up negative.&quot; Nami said. &quot;It looks like if I had just eaten my dinner without gravy, I&#39;d have at least got my own pair of underwear...&quot;<br />
<br />
Natasha was behind them, and she wanted to see her stats, as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natasha Blair<br />
Age: 16<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&quot;<br />
Weight: 141 lbs<br />
Hair: dark brown&quot;<br />
<br />
Ate food (+10), (+10), (+10)<br />
Watched TV (+10)<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get it...&quot; Natasha said. &quot;I ate all the food they wanted me to. Why didn&#39;t I get any clothes?&quot; She kept reading her stats.<br />
<br />
Took a shower (-20)<br />
Exercised (-20)<br />
Vanity (-5), (-5), (-5)<br />
Total: -15<br />
Current balance: 0<br />
<br />
&quot;...vanity?&quot; Natasha thought out loud. &quot;Wait, did it count all the time I spent in the bathroom, touching myself up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in summary,&quot; Nami said, &quot;Regina and ate too healthy, and you kept yourself too clean and didn&#39;t watch enough TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Incidentally, here are the statistics for the other girls who have been introduced thus far:<br />
<br />
Dora Spencer (the girl Regina had talked to a bit, and who Regina had told to go back into the stall to wipe better)<br />
Age: 17<br />

Height: 5&#39;7&quot;<br />
Weight: 139 lbs<br />

Played video games (+10), (+10)<br />
Exercised (-20)<br />
Total: 45<br />

<br />
-<br />
<br />
Ruby Baker-Cato (the brash teenager rooming with Melissa)<br />
Age: 13<br />

<br />
This is why she had 1 bra, 1 pair of socks, a dress and TEN pairs of panties in her dresser and closet this morning. She didn&#39;t know why she got so many panties, but oh well. She traded most of them out for more socks and bras, and even one of the tent dresses.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Paula Bishop (Regina&#39;s childhood friend)<br />
Age: 16<br />
Ethnicity: Half Hispanic, Half Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;8&quot;<br />
Weight: 141 lbs<br />
Hair: blond<br />
<br />
Ate weak food (-10), (-10), (-10)<br />
Mixed standard food into weak food (-20)<br />

Masturbated (+5)<br />
Gossiped (+10)<br />
Total: -10<br />
Current balance: 0<br />
<br />
The same thing had happened in her own group that morning. She was confused as to why she didn&#39;t get any underwear, and her own Community Director had to explain it to her.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Robyn Page (Paula&#39;s roommate and partner in crime)<br />
Age: 16<br />
Ethnicity: Mostly Caucasian, a little Hispanic (and 3% Sub-Sahara African, though she doesn&#39;t know that, even though the system does)<br />
Height: 5&#39;11&quot;<br />
Weight: 160 lbs<br />
Hair: dirty blonde<br />
<br />
Ate (+10), (+10), (+10)<br />
At dinner, she stuffed her belly as much as she possibly could, and got an extra (+10) for it<br />
Snacking (+5), (+5), (+5), (+5)<br />
Watching TV (+10), (+10), (+10), (+10)<br />
Bullying (+10), (+10)<br />
Total: 125<br />
<br />
Because of this behavior, Robyn had some of the best options for clothing that morning. She received 5 panties, 2 bras, 2 pairs of socks and a dress. However, in addition to that, she also got 3 shirts, and 2 pairs of pants (each costing 10 points apiece.) No one in Regina&#39;s group had gotten shirts or pants.<br />

Enough statistics, time for breakfast!</p>
