<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was dawn when the Big Bad Wolf Pack began to awaken after a night of hard work... or passionate love-making. Much of it was quiet, although there was a semi-terrified scream from Roger and Megan as they awoke to find one sibling laying on top of the other. The scream awoke Jack and Marcine, asleep in what had been the servants foyer. The two mostly deer, now, raised their heads in alarm and perked their ears to listen for the sound again. It seemed to be diminishing into a very unnerved conversation.<br />
<br />
The two then turned to look at each other. Their changes had now rapidly advanced from even the night before. Jack had an impressive rack of velvet covered antlers that stood out above his head. Both of them were covered in golden brown fur, with the exception of a white underbelly. Their fingers and toes were starting to fuse together and their nails enlarging to form hooves, and their faces were beginning push out into a deer's muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're almost done, dear,&quot; Marcine gave as best a smile she could and licked Jack's check.<br />
<br />
Jack nodded, but continued to look nervously about. They were inside a room, after sleeping on the floor and curled the way deer slept in the wild. And it was the room bit that unnerved him. The wolves used the rooms... and while Jack remembered Jensen promising that they would't hunt him or Marcine, he didn't want to stick around and test that promise.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get outside,&quot; Jack said, trying to get up, but now finding it difficult to get up onto his rear legs, both because his clothing didn't fit the right way anymore, and because his antlers made him extremely top heavy.<br />
<br />
He eventually fell onto his stomach and gave a pained groan. Marcine did manage to get up, but only into the standard deer's quadruped stance. Like Jack, her clothing felt awkward on her, and her underwear was painfully rubbing against a nub on her spine. Jack soon rose onto his four feet, but still felt his cloths fitting him the wrong way. He tried to turn and move them a little with his mouth to make them fit better, but nothing worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we can wear clothes, anymore,&quot; Marcine commented as she watched Jack struggle, &quot;and besides, we only have a couple of hours before we're completely deer, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then took hold of Jack's shirt with her mouth and began tugging on it, as if trying to rip it off. Jack did the same with Marcine's shirt, and the two mostly deer were soon trying to pull the clothes off of one another.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In the master bedroom, Jensen slowly awoke to what made him feel extremely content. Kaylee and Fran were snuggled next to his right side with Darla and Grace on the other. All of them looking extremely content and happy in their sleep. He took a slight sniff and listened as he heard Zachery begin to stir, with Alexandra, Isabelle, Hope, and Pearl in a similar position around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, girls,&quot; Jensen gave a low rumble as four she-wolves with him began to wake up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, master,&quot; came the unanimous reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were very good, master,&quot; Grace smiled, having lost any inhibitions about having sex with one who had once been a female, and simple friend, &quot;I don't think my former boyfriend could have ever matched you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Former?&quot; Jensen asked, as he had never heard Grace mention that she and her current &quot;toy&quot; had broken up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'll be going back to him while we all have you, master,&quot; Grace smiled, &quot;you're all that any of us want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen smiled as they all began to slowly get up. Once sitting up he looked over to Zack who still had his four snuggling up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night?&quot; Jensen teased slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most definitely,&quot; Isabelle interrupted, &quot;Zack was SOOOOOOOO good to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other females soon nodded. Zack gave his master a contented nod as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see that you all got along well,&quot; Jensen smiled, and then heard his own stomach rumble, &quot;but, I believe it is time for breakfast... since I don't think anyone but the pups and Martha had anything for dinner... and time to introduce you and the girls to your pack mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra and Pearl then looked up to their master as he sat over them on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might want to let the others clean up a bit first, master,&quot; Alexandra spoke, &quot;a lot of us got rather dirty renovating the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can take our time, before formal inspections are done,&quot; Jensen nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe you would take advantage of me!&quot; Megan exclaimed, &quot;your own SISTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear I didn't,&quot; Roger answered meekly, &quot;You know I wouldn't! You should know that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why were you on top of me?&quot; Megan demanded, &quot;Why were you in a position where you could have mated with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger shuddered. He found all of the females attractive, but his instincts shuddered at the prospect of possibly mating with his own sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't do anything of that nature,&quot; Roger answered, &quot;I was tired... you were tired... and the Alphas had us working together. I think we just collapsed from exhaustion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you couldn't just collapse on someone else?&quot; Megan growled, &quot;or elsewhere on the floor. You had to collapse on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Roger answered, &quot;I can't say anymore. We were all tired and I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a start,&quot; Megan answered, &quot;and you had better work to stay on my good side, brother. I was very willing to insure that you would get at least one female if the master was too busy, but now I might just encourage us all to sleep with Nick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick seems to have eyes for only Nicole,&quot; Roger whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think he'd protest having all of us,&quot; Megan answered him, &quot;so behave yourself... ungh... I need to shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pastel green female then began to walk away toward one of the manor's bathrooms that had a shower in it. Her fur would likely stink a bit while it was wet, but she felt she needed to get clean somehow.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In Jennifer's old room, the four pups woke up with a deep yawns as the sun fell across the bed. Of the manor's doorways, the pup's room was the only one that still had a door, although it had been heavily altered along with the part of the wall above it. Part of the frame and wall above the door had been cut and trimmed so that it could function as part of the door, and had been nailed to the original door. It served to muffle some of the howling coming from the master bedroom and the work coming from elsewhere in the manor.<br />
<br />
Seeking breakfast, the four pups crawled out of bed and stretched themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two get Alice up,&quot; Bart instructed to Kevin and Marcy, &quot;Jenny and I will wake up Miss Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy walked over to the mirror where they saw Alice sleeping calmly in the reflection of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, Alice!&quot; Kevin and Marcy yelled at the mirror, &quot;it's morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice rolled over on her bed. Marcy climbed up on the vanity and began to tap on the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up Alice!&quot; Marcy yelled at the mirror again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five more minutes, please,&quot; Alice answered from inside the mirror, &quot;the last construction projects were very noisy and I heard them from every mirror in the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Alice,&quot; Kevin urged, &quot;we don't want to be late for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice's image slowly got up and looked out from inside the mirror at the two red-brown pups before her. While the idea of breakfast wouldn't intrigue her much in glass form, it did present an opportunity to talk with her mother and auntie. Maybe they would bring a piece of breakfast into the mirrorverse with her, and she could voice her concerns with her interactions with Abbey and Samantha Butler, her cousins. She stretched and then hopped out of the mirror, landing daintily  on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us not be late,&quot; Alice then said.<br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny meanwhile opened the door to find Martha seated in a chair outside their room. On the other side of her was one of the other bedrooms in the manor, which was currently empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't sleep in a bed?&quot; Jenny asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
Bart looked as her four arms were crossed over her chest and lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she was guarding us,&quot; Bart wondered and then cringed when Kevin and Marcy began to wake up Alice.<br />
<br />
Martha also shot up when Kevin and Marcy yelled, and nearly stumbled into Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Miss Martha,&quot; Bart and Jenny chorused.<br />
<br />
Martha looked out and saw the sunlight coming in from a window, either in the wall down the hall, or on one of the doors that lead outside. It was morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Master Bart, Mistress Jenny,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I trust you slept well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both pups nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're hungry,&quot; Bart announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we have breakfast, Miss Martha?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
Martha looked down on her two charges and listened to the other two converse with Alice. She wasn't sure if the master preferred the entire pack to eat together or not, and didn't know if the master was even awake yet, but she felt that he wouldn't mind she fed his pups... after all, they were her responsibility.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh,&quot; Millie groaned as she rolled over and stretched, &quot;my back is sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't make it back to the female's den, but at least we got everything done,&quot; Maxine answered as she sat up, &quot;all the renovations are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we'll get turns with the master now,&quot; Robyn commented as she got onto all fours and shook some of the dust out of her magenta colored fur.<br />
<br />
Millie and Maxine both nodded with lovesick smiles.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The process of getting ready took a fair amount of time as several of the subordinate wolves rushed to various bathrooms to shower off the dirt, dust, and grime that their fur had collected in the course of the renovations. It was fairly difficult as the soaps in those showers were not designed to clean through their thick fur coats, and all of them were half turned off by wet wolf smell, so the process of drying off took longer then the shower itself. But once they were all done, the group began make their way toward the kitchen and dinning room to prepare something to eat.<br />
<br />
They found Kevin, Marcy, Jenny, and Bart feasting on a piece of meat that had been laid there for them by Martha, who was standing guard nearby. Alice stood nearby with a larger plate of meat waiting for Fran and Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't prepare anything for us?&quot; Nick asked as he slowly made his way into the dinning area.<br />
<br />
Martha submissively lowered her heads and avoided eye contact with the large male.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize, but you are not my charges, and it is they that informed me that they were hungry,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Lawrence spoke up, &quot;I'm sure Nick remembers WHOSE pups they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick glared back at the smaller male but said nothing. After all, the pups were the master's children. And offending them would likely offend the master as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; Terri wondered aloud, &quot;aside from the Alpha Female, who do you think the master pleased last night? Alexandra or Pearl? Or were they with one of his friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were all females,&quot; Beatrice commented, &quot;They're likely she-wolves now, so they ALL enjoyed pleasing the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was male once,&quot; Terri countered with several other she-wolves adding their agreement, &quot;I love the new me, but the fact that I was once a man shows that one of them could have changed genders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, which one of them changed genders?&quot; June wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you all settle down, ALL those questions will be answered,&quot; came Jensen's voice from behind them.<br />
<br />
They turned to see Jensen entering the dinning room with Kaylee by his side. Alexandra and Pearl followed them and were then followed by four new wolves. Three were females that looked like they were as well proportioned as Kaylee, but had fur that were mostly different shades of brown. One was a really dark brown, like dark chocolate, another was more of a plain brown, like milk chocolate, and the third had a fur coat more like a normal wolf's with the overall color being brown, but having blacks, whites, silvers, and grays mixed in. The last was a large and clearly male werewolf, although still smaller then Jensen. He was covered in charcoal black fur, which didn't glisten the way Jensen's did when the early morning sunlight hit it just right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are the twins?&quot; Sarah asked curiously, seeing that Fran and Darla were not with the Alphas and those that went into the master bedroom with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran has gone to let Marcine and Jack out, as they are likely close enough to being done that they will need to be let out,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and Darla is bringing us all plenty of meat to eat. Eggs might be more a breakfast food that we can digest, but it might be better to leave that to the shadows when they get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded and began to take an interest in the new wolves following their Alphas.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now, everyone,&quot; Jensen gave a confident smile, &quot;allow me to introduce your new Pack mates. Grace, Hope, Isabelle, and Zachery... although I'm sure you can call him Zack for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of the wolves smiled at the new females and several females gave Zack a good look over. Nick looked fairly nervous as he noticed that the new male was at best just as well built as he was and worse nearly as well built as the Master was.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as Alexandra, Pearl, Isabelle, and Hope will tell you, I'm sure you'll find Zack to be a welcome male for the pack,&quot; Jensen finished as he finished his introduction.<br />
<br />
All of them gathered around the new wolves to welcome them to the pack while they waited for Fran and Darla to return with breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did the renovations finish?&quot; Kaylee then asked, turning directly to Caroline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite well, Alpha Female,&quot; Caroline answered, &quot;I believe we got everything done on yours and the Master's list of tasks to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will they work?&quot; Kaylee then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so, Alpha Female,&quot; Caroline answered, &quot;If something fails, we will all rush to fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee glanced to Jensen and waited for the black male's response. He nodded, and thus Kaylee nodded as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be running an inspection later this morning to make sure everything has been done,&quot; Jensen then spoke, &quot;and to double check to make sure that there isn't anything I missed when the list of tasks was written down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; Caroline spoke.<br />
<br />
It was at that time that Fran and Darla returned, again carrying two large slabs of meat for the pack to feed on. The pups quickly scooted to either Martha or Jensen and Kaylee as the meat was laid down. Noticing Jenny move to stand beside her parents, Darla also chose to inform the black pup of something she'd seen while getting the meat for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shadows are all getting up,&quot; Darla spoke, both to Jensen and to Jenny and Bart, &quot;Three of them are looking increasingly feminine. They might be changing because of the dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Changing?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Darla nodded, &quot;the three that are changing do not entirely smell like men... although their transformations are slow, however. Like Jack and Marcine's.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the two older pups who gave the heavy sigh that Darla expected from Jensen.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need to both change the records and come up with some sort of corrective letter that explains how we mistook three women as men when we hired them,&quot; Bart grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That shouldn't be too hard,&quot; Jenny sighed, &quot;but frustrating. And the families can be distracted with the cover that they had a sex change operation... as I don't think any of them had any doctor relatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will that take?&quot; Jensen asked, looking down to the two pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too terribly long, but it will take time,&quot; Jenny answered her father, &quot;Bart and I can start on all of that after breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen then sighed and nodded. After all, it wasn't Jenny and Bart's fault that three of the shadows were changing genders. He half blamed the game itself and the city's poorly worded rule book on its website.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll deal with that after the inspection,&quot; Jensen finished.<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla nodded and were about to head to their position beside Jensen and Kaylee when Darla felt a gentle tug on her tail. She turned to see Alice there with a large plate of meat waiting for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you eat with me, mother? Auntie?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Jensen spoke as he began eating.<br />
<br />
Darla and Fran then nodded and smiled down at the glass wolf. Alice then lead them toward a mirror that had been set up in the room.</p>
