<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon hasn&#39;t been to the Meat Market as often as one would think. There wasn&#39;t any particular reason he couldn&#39;t have gone in before, considering he was double-dosed when he was converted. The fact that he had a girlfriend gave him less reason to go in there. In fact, other than Tyra Wrex&#39;s first show, the only time Simon had been to the Meat Market was as part of a stag party with other Project Phoenix volunteers. (Which was actually literal with Walter there.)<br />
<br />
The only reason that Simon was going to the Meat Market now was that Camille Chameleon had given him a very generous birthday gift: a coupon for a free private show at the nightclub, provided by Camille herself. It certainly would have been too rude to pass it up, especially since Camille wanted to express her gratitude for Simon saving her life and career. Still, if it weren&#39;t some unexpected prompting from Mary Alice, Simon might not have worked up the nerve to go.<br />
<br />
He could see kind of show going on the stage as he walked. It looked to be one of those Greek eroticas. Considering it featured a goat Animalian playing a set of pipes while female Animalians were dancing around in leaf-based clothes, it appeared to be one of the tales of Pan. Or at least a story about satyrs and nymphs. Simon was wondering where he should go when a grey squirrel walked up to him and asked, &quot;Are you Simon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes,&quot; said Simon, holding up his coupon, &quot;I got a coupon for-&quot;<br />
<br />
The squirrel took the coupon, took one look at it, and said, &quot;You&#39;ll need to wait a few minutes for Camille to get ready. Won&#39;t be too long. She&#39;s been expecting you.&quot; She led Simon over to one of the booths, one that had a curtain that effectively shielded its occupants from others. The squirrel left Simon in there, briefly coming back to leave a glass of Orangina and tell him that Camille will be out soon.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Simon didn&#39;t have to wait more than a few minutes before Camille entered the booth. The chameleon woman was wearing little more than a bikini and some long gloves. &quot;I&#39;m glad you took me up on my offer,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;d have been rude not,&quot; said Simon, &quot;I just wasn&#39;t sure because-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You already have a girlfriend,&quot; said Camille.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. Mary Alice snaps when her sister suggests-&quot; stared Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you have to expect her to be territorial,&quot; said Camille, &quot;Especially since she had to deal with some many competitors to get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; asked Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve talked with her at length,&quot; said Camille, &quot;I had to talk to her before I could even give you your birthday gifts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it she doesn&#39;t want you showing me too much,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a lot easier to persuade than you think,&quot; said Camille, &quot;She said I can go as far as I want with you, this one time only, if I could give you a little...education about how to please a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon&#39;s eyebrows went up at that. &quot;I never would have guessed,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, sit back and watch the show,&quot; said Camille, her tail reaching over to turn on a CD player. Simon watched with interest as the lizard girl danced very proactively in front of him. He had to admit, she was very nimble and sensual. Part of him wondered if Camille had always been this flexible or her conversion into a chameleon enhanced it. It might be the latter because of the extra cartilage in her joints. But it certainly worked to show off her bountiful curves.<br />
<br />
Simon was almost embarrassed by how quickly he got a raging stiffie. He was more embarrassed when Camille noticed it. &quot;Doesn&#39;t take you long to get fired up, does it?&quot; she asked coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hold it in for long enough,&quot; said Simon a little defensively, trying hard not to look at the bulge in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s put that to the test, shall we?&quot; asked Camille sitting down next to Simon. He leaned down and unbuttoned and unzipped his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; asked Simon as she started pulling his pants down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Your girlfriend gave me permission, remember?&quot; said Camille. When his underwear was yanked free, Simon&#39;s dick quickly sprang up, burning with need. &quot;Got quite a loaded gun, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked Camille.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not one to brag,&quot; said Simon modestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly have reason to,&quot; said Camille. She reached up with one of her prehensile feet and gently grasped Simon&#39;s dick before moving it up and down.<br />
<br />
Simon let out a gasp. He never imagined getting a footjob (or was it a handjob) quite like this. &quot;You&#39;re pretty good,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Camille, &quot;I&#39;m not like those monkeys that can type with their feet. But I can do quite a lot of stuff with my feet.&quot; For emphasis, she very lightly squeezed Simon&#39;s balls with her other foot.<br />
<br />
Simon yelped before saying, &quot;You sure go out of your way to express your gratitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, you do deserve it,&quot; said Camille, &quot;Now then, I believe I promised to show you some tips...&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It took quite a bit of time before Simon and Camille finally emerged from the booth. He had a feeling they were in there longer than most had private shows and he certainly had a more hands-on experience. But Camille was very instructive. &quot;Well, I have to say you&#39;ve got a lot of talent,&quot; said Camille, as she straightened up her top.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only as good as my teacher,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, I&#39;ve got some more time before my next turn on stage. You want to have one last romp?&quot; Camille lifted her tail in a rather inviting way.<br />
<br />
Simon was sorely tempted. He could have taken Camille back in there and pounded her again. But then he remembered who his actual bondmate was. &quot;I&#39;d like to, but if I get any more attached to you, Malice is going to be furious. And I&#39;d rather be with her any day,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Camille smiled and said, &quot;And that was your final lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s important to be able to please your mate, but the far most important thing is remaining true to her. Permitted dalliances aside,&quot; said Camille.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m really lucky to have Malice,&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then do me a favor and make sure you show her how much you truly love her,&quot; said Camille, &quot;And make sure you show her those new tricks. We don&#39;t want have to take a refresher course, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; agreed Simon, &quot;Well, thanks a lot for the gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure you use that other coupon too,&quot; said Camille.<br />
<br />
With that, Simon headed towards the exit. Camille certainly taught him a lot, and it was more than just a few new tricks for the bedroom. He needed to appreciate what he had, which made him all the more happy he had Malice.</p>
