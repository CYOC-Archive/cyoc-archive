<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When he got near the police precinct, Michael slowed down his car, as not to receive a speeding ticket. Finding a parking spot a few blocks away, he bolted out of the car and ran into the station. Inside, a police officer sat at the security desk, looking up at Michael as he entered.<br />
<br />
“You again?” the officer asked sarcastically. <br />
<br />
“Yes” Michael replied sarcastically back. “Me again. I’m here to bail out my son.”<br />
<br />
“Ooh, a troublemaker, I see? Let me check to see if he’s here.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean ‘if he’s here’? Where else would he be?”<br />
<br />
“In front of a judge, perhaps? Let me check the logs.”<br />
<br />
After the officer checked his communication device, he tracked down Evan’s location.<br />
<br />
“He’s in a cell in the back right here at the precinct” he said. “The pending charges don’t require bail, so you’re free to take him home if you want. You just have to sign an affidavit saying he will appear before the judge on the day his case is called.”<br />
<br />
Grunting, Michael took the officer’s communication device and signed the digital form on the screen. When he was done, he handed back the device to the officer. The officer stood up and motioned his hand to Michael.<br />
<br />
“Follow me” he ordered, as he led Michael down the hall.<br />
<br />
A short distance away, Michael and the officer came across a jail cell. Inside the cell was Evan and three other boys. They all looked bruised up, though none of them were bleeding.<br />
<br />
“Evan!” Michael exclaimed, as the officer opened the cell door. <br />
<br />
Evan started to sob, as the officer pulled the gate apart and went over to undo his handcuffs. <br />
<br />
“You’re free to go now, boy” he said, as he motioned Evan to his dad. “Just remember to be at the court house at the scheduled date and time of your hearing.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, as he made his way to his dad, who hugged him tightly. <br />
<br />
“What did you do to him?” Michael remarked angrily to the officer. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t do anything” the officer corrected. “Your son got those bruises from disobeying orders from other officers on patrol.”<br />
<br />
“What orders?”<br />
<br />
“He refused to comply with orders and was promptly arrested.”<br />
<br />
“I—“<br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment, before he decided to restrain himself. Getting into a fight in the precinct wouldn’t work to his advantage. He would rather leave, look at what charges Evan was facing with a clear head and then take a course of action from there. Evan continued to sob, as Michael let out a sigh, before walking with him towards the precinct exit. Before they left the cell area, the remaining boys in the cell called out to them.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” one of the boys yelled. “Aren’t you going to let us out?”<br />
<br />
“Not until you see a judge” the officer replied gruffly. “Your charges are much more serious.”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, man!” another boy yelled. “Nobody but us got hurt. What’s the big deal?”<br />
<br />
The officer ignored them, as Michael and Evan made their way out to the exit. <br />
<br />
“What are they in for?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
The officer snorted, ignoring his question.<br />
<br />
“Remember the trial date” the officer said bitterly, before Michael and Evan left the building.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded while holding his son’s hand tightly, as he took Evan out of the police station and into his car. Before Michael turned on the vehicle, he looked at his son with a concerned expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Evan” he said “before we go back home, you need to tell me everything that happened today.”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Evan replied, as he continued to cry and whimpered softly “it was horrible. Those officers were so mean to me.”<br />
<br />
“They sure sound like bastards. Let me check you out to see if I have to take you to see a doctor first.”<br />
<br />
Michael carefully looked over at his son. Evan had a bruised up face, filled with blue markings. However, he was not bleeding, at least as far as Michael could tell. Still, Michael wanted to play it safe, so he decided to take Evan to an urgent care clinic. <br />
<br />
“We need to have a doctor look at you” Michael said, as he drove off “but on the way over to the clinic, you have to tell me everything that transpired today.”<br />
<br />
Evan sniffled, before he began recalling the days events. <br />
<br />
“So what happened was that I was done with lunch and decided to walk around the neighborhood by my school before the next class. Me and a friend walked with everyone else across the street, but these officers came up to us specifically. They said we were jaywalking, even though everyone else outside was doing it too and the nearest crosswalk was like two blocks away from where we wanted to go. They didn’t care and said that we were going to get a summons for jaywalking.”<br />
<br />
“Jaywalking?” Michael asked incredulously. “Are they serious? Those…ugh. Anyways, go on.”<br />
<br />
“So, I’m telling the officers that it’s ridiculous for them to be doing this and that everyone else around us is jaywalking, but they were ignoring me and just writing the ticket anyway. So, while this is going on, the bullies from school I’ve told you about come up to us. One of them, thinking they were bumping into me, bumps into one of the officers instead. The officer gets mad and goes after my bully and pushes him onto the sidewalk. It causes a whole melee from there.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, so that’s where the bruises came from.”<br />
<br />
“Yup. They start grabbing me and the other two bullies, while my friend manages to escape. The kids who hadn’t left yet saw the officers push me onto the pavement and arrest me. They were yelling ‘stop resisting,’ but I wasn’t resisting anything. I was asking them to stop hurting me, as my face was pushed into the street really hard. They ignored my pleas and then pulled me up and took me and the bullies over to their car to take us to the precinct. I waited in that cell for like maybe an hour until you came to get me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! This is terrible. It’s bad enough these bastards are trying to kill your papa, but now they are going after you too? This has gone on far enough. Freddy has to end this now!”<br />
<br />
In that moment, Michael found a parking spot in front of the urgent care clinic and took Evan in to see a doctor. The doctor only noted some minor scrapes and bruises, before taking some x-rays and doing some tests. When he was done, the doctor said that Evan’s bruises would recover in a few days. Giving a medical report for Michael to use for Evan’s court proceeding and any potential civil lawsuit they would file, Michael took Evan back into his car and drove him home. <br />
<br />
When they arrived, Michael sent Evan up to his room, before he got out his communication device to call Freddy. He was unable to reach him, so he tried Chris’ number instead. <br />
<br />
“Hi Mr. Scavolini” Chris answered “Is everything ok?”<br />
<br />
“It most certainly is not” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh. Did I do something wrong?”<br />
<br />
“No, you didn’t. It’s about Evan.”<br />
<br />
“Is he alright?”<br />
<br />
“Yes and no. Evan got arrested at school today.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, are they serious? That’s totally low of them.”<br />
<br />
“And for the ‘crime’ of jaywalking.” <br />
<br />
“Seriously? Wow. They might be angry at Freddy, but to go after his kid is just the scummiest thing they can do. Kids are supposed to be off limits.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well I bailed him out of jail a little while ago and his court date is tomorrow. He’s all bruised up—“<br />
<br />
“Bruised up? Those fucking—“<br />
<br />
“The doctor I went to, though, said he has no internal organ damage or other serious problems. He’s just scratched up and has some bruise marks on his face.”<br />
<br />
“Unbelievable.”<br />
<br />
“Please tell Freddy this immediately and have him come home as soon as he can.”<br />
<br />
“I will pass along the message right now and will have him come back to you and Evan as soon as he can.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“No problem, Mr. Scavolini. See you in a bit.”<br />
<br />
Chris hung up on his end, as Michael sat on the living room couch and cried. He couldn’t believe this was happening to his family. Not even two days removed from the mayor’s botched assassination attempt on his husband’s life and the police were already targeting his son for “crimes” that no one else was prosecuted for. It was clearly an attempt to intimidate Freddy and Michael, one that was working, at least in his mind.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Michael could hear a car pull into the driveway. After the car door slammed loudly shut, the front door quickly opened, as Freddy stormed inside, looking fearful and panicked. <br />
<br />
“Evan!” Freddy called out, sounding worried and scared. “Are you home?!”<br />
<br />
“He’s upstairs” Michael replied calmly, as he got up to give Freddy a hug. <br />
<br />
“Papa!” Evan called out, as he left his bedroom and ran down the stairs. <br />
<br />
“Evan!” Freddy yelled, as he embraced his son in a big hug. “I’m so relieved you’re ok.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not really ok, papa. They roughed me up pretty badly and now I’m really scared they are going to go after me again.”<br />
<br />
Freddy took Evan’s head in his hands and proceeded to look him over. <br />
<br />
“You’re all bruised up” Freddy noted “but otherwise, you seem ok?”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked over at Michael.<br />
<br />
“What did the doctor say?”<br />
<br />
“No internal bruising or signs of concussion” Michael replied “but he said to keep him home for a day or two in case he develops any symptoms. I got a medical report to file with the court and also for a civil lawsuit.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went over to hug Michael tightly, as Evan walked over to Chris as he made his way inside. <br />
<br />
“Chris” Evan said, as he sobbed “today was such a bad day at school.”<br />
<br />
“Come here, Evan” Chris replied while motioning to him, looking down at him sympathetically. <br />
<br />
Evan gave Chris a big hug, but Chris hesitated to embrace him back. Looking at Michael, he eyed to Evan, asking Michael with his eyes if it was ok to hug him back. Sighing, Michael nodded, before Chris gave Evan a big, burly hug. Freddy and Michael, along with Chris and Evan, continued to embrace for a minute, before they pulled apart.<br />
<br />
“Evan” Michael said, as he held onto his hand. “Let’s get you back up to bed.”<br />
<br />
Evan sniffled, before nodding his head. <br />
<br />
“Chris?” Evan asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes Evan?” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
“Would you mind coming up to my room later? I’d like to talk to you.”<br />
<br />
“Sure kid, if your dad wouldn’t mind.”<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Michael, hoping to get his approval. Michael sighed again, before nodding his head. <br />
<br />
“Chris will come up sometime later” Michael said. “For now, please go up and try to get some more rest.”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, as he made his way up with Michael to his bedroom. In the living room, Freddy sat down on the couch, pale as a ghost. Chris sat down beside him. He thought to give him a shoulder pat, but remembered Michael’s rule about avoiding intimate contact. Sighing, he decided to speak up instead. <br />
<br />
“Look Freddy” he said “I know this has gotta be tough on you. The fact that they went after your kid was a really low blow. Granted, not that trying to kill you wasn’t a low blow in and of itself, but to go after your kid is just unbelievably horrible.”<br />
<br />
“Chris” Freddy replied, as his voice choked up “they hurt my baby boy. They hurt my son. I’m his father and I’m supposed to protect him. Instead, I left him vulnerable to being attacked like this. I failed in my duties as his papa and I’m so ashamed of myself.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Chris again thought to put his hand on Freddy’s shoulder, but restrained himself.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” he continued “look at me.”<br />
<br />
Freddy reluctantly looked at Chris, with tears rolling down his cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Freddy, you’re not a failure as a father. You’re a good papa and Evan loves you very much. The fact that the guys on the force are doing this to you and your family is all the more reason for you to be in this race.”<br />
<br />
“The fact that they went after Evan was the last straw” Michael said, as he walked in the living room. “The time to have ended this campaign was after the lunatic threw the brick into our house. We really needed to have ended this campaign of yours when they tried to kill you not even two days ago. This was the final straw, Freddy. You need to drop out the race right now.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Chris with an annoyed expression his face. <br />
<br />
“Up” he commanded. <br />
<br />
Chris sighed, as he got up to let Michael sit in his spot on the couch.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to be so rude to Chris, Michael” Freddy said, looking at him with tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“He is not our family, Freddy” Michael replied. “Remember that he is your employee. He simply takes up too much room on the couch for all three of us to sit comfortably together.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind standing, Freddy” Chris said, trying to be reassuring. “It’s not a problem at all.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t need to stand” Freddy said, as he motioned Chris into the kitchen. “Grab one of the chairs in there and bring it in here.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Chris went and grabbed a chair from the kitchen to sit in. He brought it into the living room and plopped himself down next to Freddy. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael continued “this is serious. This is no longer about your safety or your life anymore. This is about our son. He was roughed up and targeted by the police today simply for being your son. This is not about you anymore. This about us. This was the final straw. I will not allow you to endanger our family anymore for your own political ambitions.”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy replied “don’t you see what’s happening here? The mayor, knowing he couldn’t kill me again so soon after failing to do it the last time, is using this as a way of getting to us.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s working. I want you to drop out.”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, you don’t seem to get it, do you? This type of harassment will continue, even if I drop out of the race. The only way we can assure Evan’s safety now is for me to win next month.”<br />
<br />
“He can’t go back to school anymore, Freddy. Everyday he’s there, the police will target him. If he gets arrested again, the judge will up the likelihood of discipline, since it’ll be multiple arrests in a row. He could face prison time. We could see our son locked up behind bars for months. He’s already emotionally fragile as it is. This could send him into a tailspin he’ll never recover from. I cannot and will not allow that to happen to my son because of your pipe dreams of being mayor of this God forsaken town.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, if you’re that concerned with Evan’s safety, then you should realize that unless I win the race on election day, he will never be safe in this town again. If you want to protect him, then either I have to win or we have to move out of this town. There’s no other choice in the matter.”<br />
<br />
“He’s right, Mr. Scavolini” Chris added. “They aren’t going to stop targeting your son if your husband drops out of the race. Evan will have a target on his back from now on being yours and Freddy’s son. Your choices now are to either hope for victory or prepare to leave. It’s only going to get worse from here on in.”<br />
<br />
Michael groaned loudly, as he was forced to admit that they were right. There was no way Evan would be safe again in this town, not as long as the mayor was still in charge. Even if Freddy did drop out, that wouldn’t guarantee the targeted harassment of their son would stop. They were now in the situation that Devin Little’s family was facing. Michael either had to hope for an upset victory by Freddy on election day or they needed to leave this town for good. Sighing in resignation, Michael conceded defeat. <br />
<br />
“Fine. I thought it over and you guys happen to be right about this. If they hate Freddy’s message as much as they hate his campaign, then there’s no way this is going to stop unless you win or we move. I’m not ready to leave our home just yet, so I guess you should continue on with his campaign. However, we can’t let Evan out of our sights anymore. I’ll have to home school him until this campaign of yours is over.”<br />
<br />
“Do what you need to” Freddy said, as he leaned in to kiss Michael “but know that if you still want me to drop out at a later point or if I lose, then we should pack our things and get ready to move.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not ready to see your husband leave so quick” Chris added. “I kind of hope he sticks around here for a while. With the boys in blue now icing me out, I could really use the work. If your husband dropped out of the race and left this town, I’d have to move out with you guys. I won’t be able to work in this town for anyone else. No one will hire me after I crossed Peter McDonough&#39;s do not work order. I’ve put all my eggs in this basket. I’m ready to see this out to the end.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, as he got up from the couch.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to make dinner now” he said, as he made his way into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
“I just wish you were the one making dinner, Chris” Freddy remarked. <br />
<br />
“Your husband asked me to stay out of the kitchen and I’m going to honor his request. I’m trying to make sure I get along with everyone in this house and we have no problems. He insists that I stay out, so I will.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t explain what’s gotten into him, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“You know how some people can get. They have their domain and don’t want other people in it.”<br />
<br />
“It’s more than that. It’s his insisting on you calling him ‘Mr Scavolini.’”<br />
<br />
“I really don’t mind doing that, Freddy. He asked me to and I’m ok with complying with his request.”<br />
<br />
“He makes you wear clothes around the house.”<br />
<br />
“It’s for the best, really. I do have a bit of a hair problem and it’s probably a good idea to keep it covered up. Besides, it’s clearly upsetting him. I don’t want to be needlessly making him upset.”<br />
<br />
“He’s just being so uptight. I have to have a talk with him about this.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, man, if you want my advice, then you should just let it go. He’s clearly not happy with me being in this house. Honestly, if I were in his shoes and another man came into my space like this, then I’d be a bit on edge as well. I usually don’t live with the clients I work for, so this is something new for me, as it’s new for you and your husband and your son as well.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not like you’re staying with us forever. Just until the campaign is over. He knows why you have to be here. He’s lucky you’re not sleeping in the bed with us.”<br />
<br />
“Still, I can see it from his perspective.”<br />
<br />
“What other ‘ground rules’ did he give you this morning?”<br />
<br />
“Well, besides having to wear clothes around the house, except I guess in the bathroom when I’m showering, obviously, he wanted me out of the kitchen and not to be your kid’s new father and baby sitter.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God. He’s so petty sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“Look, Freddy, I get it. I’m not his dad and it’s not my place to step in as one.”<br />
<br />
“Evan has taken such a liking to you, though. I don’t know why Michael would try to drive a wedge between that.”<br />
<br />
“He seems to loosening up a bit, to be honest. Maybe just give him some time. He might come around.”<br />
<br />
“And why are you so stiff with me?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“I noticed you were going to pat me on the shoulder, but you hesitated.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s the other rule. Michael said I had to keep it professional with you. Hand shakes only. No hugs, kisses or shoulder pats.”<br />
<br />
“For Christ’s sake. Well, ignore that rule. If you want to give me a hug or a shoulder pat, I’m ok with it.”<br />
<br />
“I’d rather not upset your husband, Freddy. I think we should keep things strictly professional between us.”<br />
<br />
“Chris” Michael called out to him from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Yes Mr. Scavolini” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you go talk to Evan in his room now? We’ll call the two of you down for dinner when it’s ready.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing.”<br />
<br />
Chris got up from his chair and went up to talk to Evan in his bedroom. Getting up from the couch, Freddy walked into the kitchen and put his hands around Michael’s waist. He kissed his husband on the neck, which made Michael giggle. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said, with a certain giddiness in his voice. “Stop. You’re ticking me.”<br />
<br />
Freddy ignored him, as he planted more kisses on his neck.<br />
<br />
“I’m trying to cook here” Michael stressed. <br />
<br />
“Ok” Freddy said, as he smiled while letting go of his husband. “I just thought I’d try to cheer you up.”<br />
<br />
“It has been yet another stressful day.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it has. Speaking of which, can you do me a favor?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure. What is it?”<br />
<br />
“Would you mind laying off Chris, please?”<br />
<br />
Michael paused for a moment, before he turned around to look at Freddy directly.<br />
<br />
“Uh, what?”<br />
<br />
“These silly ‘ground rules’ you have are making Chris’ job harder. It’d be nice if you eased the reigns a bit, cowboy.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, my rules aren’t ’silly.’ They are designed for Chris to know his place in this house and to establish much needed boundaries.”<br />
<br />
“Well, for example, why do you care so much if Chris offers to cook?”<br />
<br />
“Because the kitchen is my domain, Freddy. You wouldn’t understand. You heard Chris, though. He gets it.”<br />
<br />
“He’s just trying to keep the peace around here. I have those instincts, too, but I also think it’s making him tense and rigid.”<br />
<br />
“And you think I’m not tense and rigid right now?”<br />
<br />
“Of course you are, Michael, and rightfully so. But Chris has an important job and I want to make sure he’s not all tense and unable to perform his duties well.”<br />
<br />
“His duties are to protect you and us, not cook and act as Evan’s surrogate father.”<br />
<br />
“Chris doesn’t mind cooking and he’s pretty good at it, actually. And Evan has really taken a liking to Chris. He’s helped his mood tremendously. If he wasn’t here, do you think Evan would be as calm as he is considering what just happened to him?”<br />
<br />
Michael paused for a moment before he answered, as Freddy looked at him, nudging him on to admit it with eyes.<br />
<br />
“I guess not” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“He’s done a lot to raise Evan’s spirits and make him feel better” Freddy went on. “Evan needs that right now.”<br />
<br />
“I know. That’s why I’m willing to be a little more flexible on that point. If Chris wasn’t around, Evan would probably be going on with the suicide talk after that arrest. Chris seems to have a way of knowing how to reach him in a way that I can&#39;t. But I still don’t want Evan to forget that when this is all over, Chris isn’t going to be in the picture anymore.”<br />
<br />
“What makes you say that?”<br />
<br />
“Well, for starters, if you lose, we won’t have the money to pay him anymore. His salary is coming from the campaign. Once that ends, you’re on the hook for compensating him to work for you. And even in the off handed chance that you win and become mayor, he’s not staying with us in our house anymore. He has his own apartment, so he’d be moving back there.”<br />
<br />
“He’d be around enough if I won.”<br />
<br />
“But not at all if you lost. The point is, Freddy, that Evan can’t allow himself to get too attached to Chris or it’s going to be a problem when he leaves.”<br />
<br />
Little did Michael know that Chris had walked back in that moment down to grab something from the kitchen. Noticing Freddy and Michael talking, he stood quietly out of eye line and listened to their conversation. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure Evan will learn to adjust when Chris goes” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“But it’s not a matter of being hopeful about it” Michael replied. “He’ll have to do it and I’m afraid he’s not going to adjust well once Chris goes.”<br />
<br />
Chris looked sad, as he worried about overstepping his boundaries in his relationship with his boss&#39; son, However, he was also worried about Evan. He was a good kid, but seemed to lack someone with his background who could help sort him out. Chris wanted to try to reassure Michael somehow that he wasn’t going to try to replace him as Evan’s dad, but didn’t know how to address it with him. <br />
<br />
“I think this is more than about your worries about Evan adjusting to Chris moving out” Freddy pressed on. “I think you are secretly a bit jealous of Chris.”<br />
<br />
“I’m most certainly not!” Michael shrieked. <br />
<br />
“I think you’re jealous that Chris knows how to cook, that he gets along with Evan so well and that he makes everyone in this household feel at ease.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not jealous of him, Freddy. Am I still upset about him being here? Yes. But that’s because I worry about you trying to do something with him.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God” Chris thought to himself. “I had a feeling this might have had something to do with it.”<br />
<br />
“What?!” Freddy exclaimed. “Michael are you serious?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” Michael replied sternly. “I saw you gawking at that gorilla rug on his chest this morning.”<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to look at it, that’s all. You didn’t have to get your panties in a wad over it.”<br />
<br />
“You were ogling and lusting over him. I knew you still had the hots for him and that’s part of the reason why I didn’t want you to hire him in the first place.”<br />
<br />
“We haven’t done anything, Michael, and I promise you that we never will. He’s straight and I’m a faithful husband to you.”<br />
<br />
“For the most part.”<br />
<br />
“For the most part?” Chris thought to himself. “Uh oh.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s not talk about that right now, Michael” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“Chris is going to have to learn about it eventually” Michael replied. “If he’s going to continue working for you, then he’s going to find out about it eventually.”<br />
<br />
“Oh dear” Chris thought to himself. “I probably shouldn’t be listening in to this, but maybe I can help them out with whatever they’re dealing with right now. I just wish Michael would trust me and let me in a little. I’m not the bad guy he thinks I am.”<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t have to know about it right this second” Freddy insisted.<br />
<br />
“He’ll find out about it when you dog out while he’s protecting you” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“Jesus” Chris thought to himself. “This sounds bad.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went into kiss Michael on the lips.<br />
<br />
“That conversation with Chris can wait” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“Let me walk back a bit and then go into the kitchen” Chris thought to himself, as he stepped back a few feet and then made his presence known to them.<br />
<br />
“Oh Chris” Michael said “you can let Evan know that dinner will be ready in 20 minutes or so.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing” Chris replied. “I was just getting Evan some water.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled, as he stepped out of the kitchen to use the bathroom in his bedroom. <br />
<br />
“He’s a really good kid, you know” Chris said, as he pulled out a bottle of water from the fridge.<br />
<br />
“I know” Michael replied. “I’m just worried about how today is going to psychologically mess him up. He seems fine now, but the trauma hasn’t really hit him just yet. I’m worried about what happens in a few days from now.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure Evan is going to handle it just fine. He has fantastic parents, both you and Freddy. He’ll get through this. I know he will.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“I’m absolutely sure of it. You two are great parents and I know Evan loves you both very much, Mr. Scavolini.”<br />
<br />
“How do you know? Did he tell you this?”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, before he lied in his response. <br />
<br />
“Yes” Chris answered. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad to know he says that to you” Michael replied, as he continued working on making dinner. “I just wish he’d tell me every once in a while.”<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Michael sympathetically. In that moment, he knew how he was going to try to make things better in the household. Before going back up into Evan’s room, he reached over and held onto Michael’s hand. <br />
<br />
“I know he loves you” Chris insisted. “You’re a great dad to him. You’re the reason he is who he is today. Without you, he wouldn’t be the wonderful, sweet, kind and inquisitive boy that I’ve had the absolute privilege of getting to know these last few days. I know I won’t be living in your house for that much longer, but for the time I’m here, I’m grateful that I’m able to spend it with the special young man you raised.”<br />
<br />
Michael smiled at the compliment, but pushed Chris’ hand off of his. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” Michael replied, blushing as he did so. “That means a lot to me, coming from you. Evan likes you a lot, so to know you feel that way is encouraging to hear.”<br />
<br />
“I really mean it. Don’t let anyone else tell you that you’re a bad dad.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Chris with a confused expression on his face, before Chris walked out to go back into Evan’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“I wonder what he meant by that?” Michael thought to himself, as he continued to make dinner.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Chris passed Freddy as he left his bedroom. <br />
<br />
“Just had to use the bathroom” Freddy said to Chris, as he headed back downstairs. <br />
<br />
“It’s your home” Chris replied. “Don’t let me stop you from doing your business.”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Chris opened the door to Evan’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid” he said, as he closed the door behind him and sat on the edge of Evan’s bed. “I brought you some water.”<br />
<br />
“Took you long enough” Evan noted, as Chris opened the bottle and handed it to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t be fresh. I was just talking to your dad. It kind of held me up a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks though.”<br />
<br />
Evan quickly gulped down the bottle and handed it back to Chris. Chris chuckled, as he put it on a dresser in Evan’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“You must have been pretty thirsty” Chris noted. <br />
<br />
“I was” Evan replied, as Chris sat back down on his bed. “The cops didn’t give me any water and this whole experience has really been stressing me out.”<br />
<br />
“Well, the good news is that it’s over now and you’re safe and sound back in your own bed.”<br />
<br />
“Those bullies sure got a rough lesson, though.”<br />
<br />
“They sure did, but that wasn’t exactly how I was hoping it was all going to go down.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Well, presuming the judge goes easy on them, considering they are minors and all, those kids are going to take their anger out on you.”<br />
<br />
Evan gulped, as Chris moved to put his fingers through his hair. <br />
<br />
“You don’t mind me doing that, right Evan?”<br />
<br />
Evan shook his head no, as Chris continued to sift his fingers through the boy&#39;s hair. <br />
<br />
“My dad used to do this to me when I was your age. It was a very Italian thing. We were very touchy feely in that way. Some people thought it was kind of gay, but I knew it was my dad&#39;s way of showing that he cared about me. That’s why it kind of drives me crazy that your dad is so uptight about these things.”<br />
<br />
“I guess he’s just nervous about you being around, that’s all. He’s still kind of upset about the fact that you bullied him when you went to school together. If I was in his shoes and one of my bullies worked for my spouse, it’d take me a long time to warm up to them too. Even if they became someone as nice as you are, it&#39;d be hard to let go of the things they had done to me in the past.”<br />
<br />
“I guess you have a point there, Evan. I respect that your dad needs time to get comfortable with me being around your house. Speaking of your dad, though, I was kind of hoping you could do me a favor, kid.”<br />
<br />
“What’s that, Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you love your dad, right?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I do. He’s very caring, supportive and does so much for me. Out of my two parents, he’s the one who has always been there for me. Even when papa has been absent in my life, dad has been there for everything. He’s never missed a school graduation, or a parent teacher conference or had to be away when I was home sick from school. He’s a great dad, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe you should tell him all the stuff you told me just now.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Why?”<br />
<br />
Chris let out a long sigh, before he answered Evan’s question. <br />
<br />
“Well, your dad has been having a hard time dealing with all of this, as have you, and I think he needs to hear you say this to him.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, he should know it already.”<br />
<br />
“It might make him feel better if you told him to his face. When your papa and I are out working tomorrow, I would really appreciate it if you talked to your dad and told him all the things you told me about him today to him directly. I am sure he’d really appreciate hearing you saying that to him. He could really use the words of encouragement from you right about now.”<br />
<br />
“Why? Is something wrong with dad?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing more than you already know about, but I’m just asking you to do this little favor for me. You like me, don’t you Evan?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I do, Chris. You’re a really cool guy.”<br />
<br />
“Then please do me this favor for me. It would mean a lot to your dad and it would mean a lot to me, too.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, Chris. I will tell him what I told you tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Chris ruffled Evan’s hair, before getting up from the bed.<br />
<br />
“You’re a good kid, Evan. I’ll tell you what. Let me go downstairs and I’ll bring you up your dinner tonight. Would you like that?”<br />
<br />
Evan nodded, before Chris left his bedroom. The rest of the evening was relatively uneventful. As Evan ate his meal in bed with Chris by his side, Freddy and Michael discussed what their strategy would be moving forward. They had a plan to hit the mayor on targeting their son as soon as possible. Although the next day would start out in their favor, that evening would turn out to be the scariest one they’ve faced yet.<br />
<br />
The following evening…..</p>
