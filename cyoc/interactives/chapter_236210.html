<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trees parted as they reached the beach, and the sight of the calm lake spread out before them, shimmering under the afternoon sun. The water looked inviting, the perfect reward after the hike. Ryder was the first to drop his pack, his excitement palpable as he ran to the water&#39;s edge and dipped his toes in. &quot;This is awesome!&quot; he shouted, glancing back at Cam with a grin.<br />
<br />
Cam followed, kneeling down next to his pack to dig out his swim trunks. The beach had always been their favorite spot, a quiet haven where they could relax, swim, and just enjoy the day. Ryder was already bouncing around in his cargo shorts, eager to dive in.<br />
<br />
But as Cam rummaged through his pack, a sinking feeling hit him. He dug deeper, pulling out towels, sunscreen, everything but the swim trunks. &quot;Shit,&quot; he muttered under his breath, his fingers searching the bottom of the pack just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Ryder, noticing Cam’s hesitation, stopped splashing at the shoreline and looked back. &quot;What’s up, Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam sat back on his heels, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;I forgot my trunks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder didn’t miss a beat. Standing there in his cargo shorts, he shrugged and grinned. &quot;So what? There’s no one around.&quot; His tone was casual, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. &quot;Just skinny dip! No big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam raised an eyebrow, feeling a wave of hesitation wash over him. &quot;I don’t know, bud…&quot; He wasn’t sure if he was ready to strip down completely, even out here where they had the whole place to themselves.<br />
<br />
Ryder, ever the carefree spirit, laughed and took a few steps closer. &quot;I’ll skinny dip with you, Dad,&quot; he said confidently. Without waiting for a response, Ryder kicked off his flip-flops and quickly unbuttoned his cargo shorts. The shorts fell to the sand with a soft thud, leaving Ryder in his stretched, strained Spider-Man briefs.<br />
<br />
Cam’s heart skipped a beat as Ryder, with zero hesitation, yanked down the briefs. It took a bit of effort—those things had been holding on for dear life all day—but with a quick tug, Ryder freed himself, finally stepping out of the briefs and handing them to Cam with a grin.<br />
<br />
Cam stared for a moment, lost in thought and wonder. The briefs hung from Ryder’s outstretched hand, the seams clearly strained from earlier. Small rips had formed along the waistband and around the leg openings, signs of the impossible task those briefs had faced. But that wasn’t what had Cam frozen in place.<br />
<br />
No, it was the sight of Ryder, completely naked, standing there with the sun gleaming off the water behind him. For the first time, Cam took in the full results of what had happened since this morning—since the cold swim, the hike, the warmth bringing Ryder’s body back to its full, relaxed state. And it was something.<br />
<br />
Ryder’s nuts were massive. Cam had noticed them earlier, of course, but now, without the briefs holding anything back, they were fully exposed—and huge. Each one was the size of an apple, maybe even bigger, hanging low and full between Ryder’s legs. They were larger than Cam’s entire sac, which had always been a decent size, but this? This was on another level.<br />
<br />
And then there was Ryder’s cock.<br />
<br />
Even soft, it was a beast. Thick—insanely thick—much wider than Cam’s, even when he was hard. Ryder’s soft cock hung heavily, the girth of it almost twice what Cam’s was, the shaft meaty and full. It stretched down, longer than Cam’s even at its most relaxed. This can’t be real, Cam thought, his mind spinning as he took in the sheer size of Ryder’s package. His softie’s bigger than I am hard… The length, the width—it all defied explanation. Ryder had a cock that would’ve made a fully grown man envious, and here he was, standing on the beach, acting like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
Cam slowly reached out, his fingers brushing the waistband of the briefs Ryder was still holding out to him. His mind was swimming, a mix of fascination, envy, and something else entirely. Ryder’s body had transformed in ways Cam couldn’t wrap his head around, and now, without the briefs to hide anything, the full extent of it was right there in front of him.<br />
<br />
Ryder, oblivious to his dad’s internal struggle, smiled as he handed over the briefs. “Here, Dad. You take ‘em.” He stepped closer, not giving it a second thought. “I’m ready for the water.”<br />
<br />
Cam’s hand shook slightly as he took the briefs from Ryder, the fabric warm and soft in his grip, but his eyes remained locked on Ryder’s body. The kid’s cock hung down heavily, still soft but massive, stretching out and resting against his thighs. It was impossible to ignore the sheer size of it—the weight of it. And those nuts… they swayed gently as Ryder moved, his balls full and round, looking like they were taking up more space than they had any right to.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Cam was at a loss for words. He had expected the cold water to keep things smaller, but now, fully warmed up from the hike and the sun, Ryder’s body had returned to its new, relaxed state—and it was even bigger than Cam had imagined. The rips in the briefs made sense now. No fabric could have contained that.<br />
<br />
Cam swallowed hard, trying to find his voice, but all he could manage was a soft, &quot;Wow…&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder didn’t seem to notice the awe in Cam’s tone. He was already turning back toward the water, his bare feet kicking up sand as he ran toward the lake. “Come on, Dad! The water’s waiting!”<br />
<br />
Cam blinked, still holding the ripped briefs in his hand, his mind struggling to catch up with what he had just seen. That’s him at his smallest, he thought, staring at Ryder’s retreating form, the kid’s cock and balls swaying slightly as he moved. Jesus…<br />
<br />
The beach was theirs, and Ryder, for all his size, was still just the carefree, playful kid he’d always been. Cam shook his head, a small smile tugging at his lips as he finally stood up. Skinny dipping it is, he thought, the weight of the moment sinking in as he tossed the ripped briefs onto his pack.<br />
<br />
Cam reached for his belt, unhooking it and tugging his hiking pants down. He hesitated for a moment, feeling the cool breeze hit his legs, his own briefs still clinging to him from the hike. But the thought of getting in the water, cooling off, was too tempting to pass up. His briefs came off next, and as they dropped to the sand, Cam took a deep breath, standing there for a second, completely exposed to the open air.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t help but glance down, taking stock of himself. Alright, he thought, nothing to be ashamed of. He wasn’t lacking in the department most guys cared about. His dick hung there, soft but decent, his balls loosened a bit from the warmth of the sun. But then his mind flickered back to Ryder—shit—and that immediate comparison hit him like a truck.<br />
<br />
He’s still in the water, probably not even noticing, Cam told himself, trying to shake the thought. But the truth was, he couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ryder’s soft cock had been a beast earlier, hanging heavy and thick even when cold and shriveled. And those balls... Jesus, they were massive, far beyond anything Cam had seen in his life. The kid didn’t even seem to notice, but Cam sure as hell did.<br />
<br />
Cam waded into the water, the coolness instantly hitting his skin, making his breath hitch as the lake welcomed him. The cold felt good after the long hike, a shock to the system that seemed to momentarily distract him from the morning’s realizations. He watched Ryder up ahead, swimming farther out, already diving beneath the surface and popping up again with a loud laugh.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dad! You’re so slow!” Ryder shouted, splashing water toward him, a grin plastered on his face.<br />
<br />
Cam couldn’t help but smile, shaking his head as he stepped in deeper. The water rushed up around his waist, cooling everything down, and for a second, he let out a soft groan, feeling the chill pull at him. He could already feel the cold doing its work, his nuts drawing up slightly, his cock losing a bit of its weight as the lake worked its magic. Not my best look, he thought with a smirk, but there was no one here to care.<br />
<br />
Except Ryder, of course.<br />
<br />
Cam’s eyes flicked over to his son, now waist-deep in the water, still splashing and laughing. Ryder, despite the cold, didn’t seem to be shrinking the way Cam expected. Sure, his balls had drawn up a little, but they were still hanging there, full and plump, even in the cold water. His soft cock was thick as ever, bobbing slightly as he moved through the lake. How the hell is he still so big? Cam wondered, a mix of fascination and envy rolling through him.<br />
<br />
“Catch me if you can!” Ryder shouted, diving beneath the surface again, disappearing in the clear water.<br />
<br />
Cam took a deep breath, shaking off the thoughts that had been clouding his mind. You’re here to have fun, not compare yourself, he reminded himself, though the comparison was hard to shake. His own softie had pulled in a bit from the cold, and his nuts had drawn up, tight and pruney, nothing like the fullness he saw in Ryder.<br />
<br />
He dove under the water, swimming toward Ryder with long, smooth strokes. The cold water felt amazing, washing away the heat of the hike and refreshing every inch of his skin. He popped up a few feet from Ryder, shaking the water from his hair and laughing as Ryder tried to splash him again.<br />
<br />
“Not bad for an old man, huh?” Cam teased, his voice light as he tread water.<br />
<br />
“You’re not that old!” Ryder shouted back, grinning as he splashed again, trying to dodge his dad’s playful attempts to dunk him.<br />
<br />
Cam felt lighter now, more relaxed as they played in the water, roughhousing like they always did. Ryder’s energy was infectious, and for a little while, Cam let go of everything else, just focusing on the fun they were having. But still, even as they splashed and swam, there was no ignoring the way Ryder moved through the water—big, despite the cold, his cock hanging thick and heavy, his balls staying full even in the lake’s chill.<br />
<br />
They played for a while longer, the cold water waking them up and cooling them off, both of them laughing and splashing like kids. Cam swam over to Ryder again, catching his son’s grin as they floated near the deeper part of the lake. Ryder was still oblivious to the difference in their size, but Cam’s eyes couldn’t help but drift downward, catching glimpses of Ryder’s package beneath the water.<br />
<br />
Damn, Cam thought, his mind racing. Even when he’s cold, he’s bigger than me. How is that even possible?<br />
<br />
Ryder was all energy, diving back under the water and coming up again with a splash, completely unaware of the thoughts swirling in Cam’s head. But Cam couldn’t shake it. The more they played, the more obvious it became. Ryder wasn’t shrinking like he should’ve been—if anything, he was still swinging huge, and it was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
Cam shook his head, finally giving in. Screw it. Just have fun, he thought, trying to focus on the moment. There was no point in comparing anymore. Ryder had him beat, and there was no denying it. All that was left was to enjoy the day and try not to dwell too much on the size difference hanging between them.</p>
