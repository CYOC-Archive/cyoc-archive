<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few minutes later I found myself hanging out in Cathy's bedroom, a posh horse friendly shed in the back yard with full electricity, gas, and water.<br />
<br />
Cathy was laying all fours on a plush quilted rug on the floor with me beside her in front of the fireplace. Yes, she had a fireplace. We had sat down together, kissed some more, and started talking. It turned out that once you got to know her Cathy really wasn't that bad, and she was quite a lot of fun. Even if I hadn't of kind of seduced her with a wish I think she would have won me over anyway.<br />
<br />
Now we had broken open a bottle of red wine and I had poured two glasses. I sipped my own and swirled it, occasionally reaching down to lift Cathy's glass to her mouth and let her drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... this is nice.&quot; I grinned, leaning back into her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah!&quot; She blurted out, snorting. &quot;You're already treating me better than most of the guys I've ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sipped my wine again and melted against her, grinning with my eyes closed. &quot;So! I have to ask you a question!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessss?&quot; She turned, smirking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you tell me more about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; The horse reeled her neck back and blinked. &quot;I t-thought...&quot; She shook her head and snorted. &quot;Nevermind. Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
I settled in, leaning into Cathy's chest as we got comfortable by the fire, and together we drank some more wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it goes like this.&quot; She sighed, sipping occasionally from the glass I kept holding up to her lips. &quot;Your mom was born a human, I was born a horse. Word around town was that your grandmother was into farm animals, and by some freak of chance she got pregnant. Hence,&quot; She shook her head in disgust. &quot;Me. I'm the only talking horse person in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; I went wide eyed, wondering how else I had buggered up all of reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right?&quot; She took some more wine, getting a little looser as time went on. &quot;So, I'm famous for all the wrong reasons right from my fillyhood. School was fun. Your mom's a horse fucker, kid. You're the bastard mare. It's Mrs. Ed! And it got worse in high school. You know, when I started to really come into my... marehood, I guess. Not everybody was mean, though. A select few thought I was the coolest thing ever. I totally rocked at track, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's with you and my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was this guy, James. Probably the only guy that ever really cared for me like... like I was a person. Treated me with respect. Like, he took me out for a beautiful moonlit walk. Just me and him, talking, and we wound up sitting in a field back home, just staring at the stars.&quot; She sighed girlishly. &quot;It was lovely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom fucked it up?&quot; I was starting to feel a little drunk and wished we'd both sober up. Which we did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... a whole bottle and I don't feel a thing.&quot; Cathy kicked away the empty wine with her back. &quot;Anyway, yeah. Your mom outed my lover to the town and they made him ride the rails out of there, practically threatened his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a bitch!&quot; I scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. So that's the story.&quot; She snuffed sadly and put her head on my shoulder, almost crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else should I know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Cathy thought for a moment. &quot;After school I made an honest living working on various farms. I was a big strong girl, you see, and all my athletics and running had gotten me in shape. Eventually, me and this jockey meet up, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; I began rubbing her neck gently, brushing my fingers through her coarse but beautiful fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;He gets me into racing and I got damn famous in my day. The unbeatable Cathy! See the jockeyless horse!&quot; She smiled. &quot;I became a legend in our local circuit, and was just getting really popular when I fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How's that?&quot; I stared up at her, really quite amazed at how a simple wish had altered the course of human history.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doped.&quot; She hung her head again. &quot;Got into steroids. Started to beef up. Like, I got huge for a bit there. And people got suspicious. Lost a lucrative sponsor, lost a small fortune, and got a big fine by the horse racing administration. Cause I got stupid and greedy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do it?&quot; I asked gently, seeing her tearing up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to beat everybody.&quot; Cathy admitted sadly. &quot;It seemed like a surefire way to do it. Anyway.&quot; She sighed again. &quot;Met Sara's dad, he knocked me up in the same freaky fluke like my mom. And I give birth to a perfect little baby girl. Sara. Then the asshole took off and we never saw him again.&quot; She seemed eager to finish her story. &quot;So anyway, blah blah blah, wound up moving here. I work as a plowhorse these days, mostly. Helps keep me in some kind of shape, but I'm not the horse I used to be. Honest day's wage, I guess, and all that. Keep going out with abusive dicks. My therapist says it's a pattern or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; I blinked as she finished her tale of woe. &quot;You've had it pretty rough, haven't you, Auntie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh. Is what it is.&quot; She shrugged her front legs. &quot;But you made me feel better than I've felt in quite a few years, honey. So thanks for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could... I could make you feel even better.&quot; I suggested, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; She smirked. &quot;You're still blood. I have a bad crush on you, sweetie, but I'm still your Auntie. As fucked up as that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So a few kisses are all I get?&quot; I faked annoyance. &quot;Geez. I hope you don't treat all your relatives like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She snorted loudly and looked at me with slight embarassment in her lively brown eyes. &quot;Jamesssss, be nice. It was... a moment of emotion. I'd been drinking all day. Let's just remember this as a really nice little experience and... and move on. Okay? I still think you're cute, though. So... a kiss now and then couldn't hurt.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Cathy. You know I think you're sexy. You know I like animals. You know I'm into you. I know you're into me. What could it hurt?&quot; I wished she'd tell me what was wrong.<br />
<br />
The horse went deadly serious and looked down at the ground. Now she really was crying, a few tears shedding from the corners of her eyes. &quot;...James.&quot; She said softly, and closed her eyes in pain. &quot;I'm scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of what, my big mare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if people find out?&quot; She looked at me pleadingly. &quot;It won't hurt me, I'm tough as nails by now. But what about you, honey? Incest. With your aunt. And beastiality. We're talking jail time, James. You're too young for that, too... nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought for a moment and leaned in close, gently taking her chin in my hand and forcing her to look into my eyes. &quot;I guess sometimes we have to take risks to get what we want. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Really?&quot; She looked into my eyes with shock. &quot;Y-You feel that strongly for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
This strange little play had gotten wildly out of control. Had I been affected by my own wishes, too? What was going on?! I really did have feelings for her. &quot;Y-Yes...&quot; I nodded gently, trembling. &quot;For as long as I've known you I've been amazed by you. You're special, Cathy. Y-You're one of a kind. You know what I like. What I like to look at, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it too.&quot; She admitted, looking at me tenderly, as if considering. &quot;I like looking at handsome anthro stallions. Gets me going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love... horses.&quot; I admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me how much.&quot; She whispered softly, tearing up again. &quot;You can have me, honey. I'll be your mare.&quot; Now she looked at me with deep vulnerability, insecurity. &quot;Please... treat me right. Promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise, Cathy. I... I promise... my mare.&quot; A strange tingle of excitement went through my stomach, but at the same time I felt a strange alarm in the back of my mind. I knew this was all messed up. The magic was out of control. Something was really wrong with the universe.<br />
<br />
We slowly advanced on each other, Cathy bringing her muzzle forward, closing her eyes. I closed my own eyes, slowly meeting her lips, and we kissed again. More slowly, more sinfully, physically embracing each other's strange little desires. Feeling our lust and excitement at each other's words growing. The kissing lasted minutes, each delicious moment turning into another more delicious moment. It seemed that the longer we did it, the better it felt. Until finally Cathy broke away, opening her eyes and staring at me in stunned silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;James...&quot; She whispered again. &quot;You're... hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, I was sporting wood through my pants. I blushed deeply. Now where was this going to go? I nodded sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I... see it?&quot; Her voice wavered, and she stared at me just as sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Without much more words, I opened my fly with shaking hands and dropped my pants. Cathy smiled lustfully and stared at the bulge throbbing in my shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going.&quot; She gulped, nervous as I was. We were about to cross the boundary all the way. There was no turning back from this. Bravely I lowered my shorts, letting my dick spring up to full view. A modest 5.11 inches long. A little thicker than average though. &quot;It's not much.&quot; I admitted, thinking of the boner that a full grown stallion could give her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nonsense...&quot; She leaned in closer, examining it. &quot;It's so handsome. Just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sat back, sweating, and Cathy seemed to shake with the same kind of anticipation. We were going to do this. This was wrong, but it felt fucking great for both of us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I... can I taste it?&quot; She looked up at me, almost pleadingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.&quot; I whispered.<br />
<br />
The horse got more comfortable, pulling herself forward to get closer to the action, and her lips hovered inches from my tip. I took a deep breath, she took a deep breath, and then I watched with wonder as her pink equine tongue gently appeared and gave my shaft a gentle lick.<br />
<br />
I jumped, unfamiliar with the feeling of horse's tongue, and jolted at the prickles of new intense pleasure that hit me.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Was that okay?&quot; She looked up at me. &quot;I-I don't do this much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-More.&quot; I nodded, placing my hand between her ears and bracing.<br />
<br />
She licked again, carefully, slowly, and I could see she was indeed inexperienced. It was wonderful, sharing this with her. With each lick her alien tongue felt better and better, and the way it encompassed my cock with each wet slurp was a huge turn on. She could see my response well enough, and her confidence began to grow.<br />
<br />
The licking was great, and now I was throbbing and horny... aching for it. She looked up at me, her eyes asking, and I nodded gently. With the greatest care, the big horse opened her mouth all the way. With both hands I grabbed her ears, gulping, as she lowered her mouth onto me.<br />
<br />
I gasped, feeling the delicious warmth of her long equine muzzle, and melted into the floor. She sucked gently, oh so gently for an animal her size and strength, and felt me pulse in her mouth. She moaned deeply, and began bobbing up and down, holding my shaft in her amazingly muscular lips and beggining to suck. I was being full on blown by a horse. And it felt fucking fantastic.<br />
<br />
She kept it up for a good fifteen minutes, building and building my pleasure. I wished she wouldn't stop, no matter what. And when I finally came from her strong, powerful rythym, she kept going, guzzling my cum down greedily, still sucking dilligently, her eyes closed in pure concentration, focused on nothing but my cock.<br />
<br />
I laid back, squirming, and let her continue. The second orgasm took a full half hour to tease out, and I let out a tremendous cry of pure ecstasy. Still she kept going, me now panting raggedly, hanging on for all I was worth, dangerously close to passing out as my third orgasm tumbled out. It took another hour to get to the fourth, my flesh aching and tender, just a few drops of my jizz draining into her mouth. Still she kept sucking, as I pulled on her ears shaking in a sweaty stupor.</p>
