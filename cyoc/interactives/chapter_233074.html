<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What’s the matter in there?” Jane had heard Phil’s groan.<br />
<br />
“It’s happened again!” Phil sounded alarmed<br />
<br />
“What’s happened?”<br />
<br />
“I think I’ve grown breasts” He pulled the necklace up over his head and flung it onto the bathroom bench. If he was correct, wearing it again had only made his situation worse.<br />
<br />
He unlocked the door and allowed Jane into the bathroom. Her eyes immediately sought out Phil’s torso. It was covered by his suitcoat but there did appear to be a definite bulge in his chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh dear!” she said then moved her eyes to look at Phil’s own. His face was still his own. “Better take off the jacket and show me the damage”<br />
<br />
Phil did so, Once the jacket was off it was clear that he had breasts. They were big ones, pushing his shirt out. His engorged nipples were clear to see through the white shirt.<br />
<br />
Jane attempted to lighten the situation “One of the first things my mother told me after puberty was that ‘If you are going to wear a white shirt you should wear a bra underneath otherwise your nipples will show”<br />
<br />
“Not funny” said Phil as he felt the mass of his boobs in his masculine hands.<br />
<br />
“Off with the shirt” Jane said<br />
<br />
Phil complied. He revealed two decent sized breasts on his now hairless torso. Phil had pink areolas and his nipples were a good centimetre in diameter and at least that long.<br />
<br />
“If we ever have a baby we will be able to share the breastfeeding”<br />
<br />
“They are huge”<br />
<br />
“Probably a C-cup. Maybe even a D” suggested Jane. “But they are lovely and perky. No sag at all”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to have breasts”<br />
<br />
“I think we have confirmed that wearing the necklace causes the changes” <br />
<br />
“Yes, but I didn’t wish for breasts. I wished for a dick and that didn’t happen” <br />
<br />
“Tell me. I know it’s a bit personal, but did you feel uncontrollably randy just before your breasts grew”<br />
<br />
Phil’s blush gave him away. He meekly replied “Yes. I couldn’t help but masturbate”<br />
<br />
“That’s the same as it was for me at the restaurant. That must be another effect of wearing the necklace”<br />
<br />
“The man in the shop sort of hinted that the jewellery would aid our sex life”<br />
<br />
Jane had to think about what Phil had just said “So you knew that when I wore the necklace I would feel turned on?”<br />
<br />
“No. No. I didn’t know anything. I was just looking for an anniversary present. Something you would like” Phil was defensive. <br />
<br />
“What did this man actually say?”<br />
<br />
“He was a strange little old man. I can’t remember his exact words. But there was something about the pendant and the ring needing to be worn at the same time – not necessarily by the same person”<br />
<br />
“Is that all?”<br />
<br />
“I remember questioning him. He said the pendant wasn’t dangerous so long as we followed the instructions”<br />
<br />
“Instructions! You tell me now there are instructions?”<br />
<br />
“That’s what the man said” Phil replied sheepishly<br />
<br />
“I little late for you it seems” Jane was annoyed at Phil. “So where are these instructions?”<br />
<br />
“Umm…. I don’t know…. Maybe in the box that came with the set?”<br />
<br />
“And where is this box?” Jane had not seen a box. She could only recall Phil presenting her with the pendant then later the matching ring<br />
<br />
“Didn’t I give it to you?” Even as he said that he had no recollection of giving the box to Jane.<br />
<br />
“Not that I recall. You gave me the pendant then shortly afterwards the matching ring”<br />
<br />
“They were in a box……. Maybe I left it in my pocket” Phil had an awful dread that he had left it at the restaurant. “I’ll check” <br />
<br />
Phil put Jane’s white panties back on but didn’t bother with the rest of his clothes. So just wearing his white business shirt, Jane’s panties and his black socks he returned to the bedroom. He couldn’t help but feel how his newly acquired breasts bounced with every step he took. They felt heavy as well. <br />
<br />
In the bedroom he located the trousers he had worn the previous day and checked the pockets. The pockets were empty barring for a handkerchief. There was no sign of the small beige box, the pendant and ring had been in.<br />
<br />
He looked on his bedside table, where he often put things that he found in his pockets, there was no sign of the box. “I don’t seem to have it Jane” he called out “Could you just check your handbag?”<br />
<br />
Jane was a bit exasperated. She had never seen a box. “I’ll check but I don’t recall seeing a box”. Sure enough there was no mysterious box in her handbag. “No I don’t have a box. When do you last have it?”<br />
<br />
“At the restaurant. When I took the ring out”<br />
<br />
“You don’t think you could have left it in the car?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so, but I’ll check” Phil began to head for the door<br />
<br />
“You had better put your clothes back on” Jane reminded him. “The neighbours will wonder who the big breasted butch girl is otherwise”<br />
 <br />
“Oh. Yeah…. These wobble so much. How can you live with them?”<br />
<br />
“When my boobs were small they didn’t wobble a lot. Remember, I’ve only had one day of having large knockers of my own. You will need to wear a bra if you want to be comfortable”<br />
<br />
“A bra?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Bras are not just for looks. They stop wobble and allow your shoulders to take a lot of the weight. They will stop your breasts sagging in the longer term”<br />
<br />
“I don’t plan to stay this way for long”<br />
<br />
“I dare say. However, I think we should find these instructions before you try any more wishes with the pendant. You can borrow one of my new bras. If you wear your suit coat over the top I doubt anyone will notice”<br />
<br />
Phil decided to take Jane up on her offer. The neighbours did have a good view of their carport and chances were that the box wasn’t in the car and that he had left the box at the restaurant. More likely then not he would need to return to the restaurant for the box.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later Jane had helped Phil into her brand new flesh coloured bra, it was lacy and feminine, but Phil had no choice if he wanted to stop the wobble, which he found highly distracting. Jane did comment “I actually think you have lost a bit of fat from around your tummy. You actually look slimmer”<br />
<br />
“I can’t actually see me tummy anymore” commented Phil. “These breasts get in the way”<br />
<br />
He then fussed around to find other clothes he could wear that hid as much as possible the fact that he now had a woman’s body. He ended up putting on a dark blue shirt and a suit that was generally just a little too large. Only when Phil was satisfied that he looked manly enough, and had reinserted a sock into the panties, did he venture outside to the car. A thorough look showed no sign of the jewellery box.<br />
<br />
Jane had started on dinner when Phil returned inside. He told her “No sign of it. I’ll ring the restaurant and see if they found anything. I hope if I left it there they have not thrown it out”</p>
