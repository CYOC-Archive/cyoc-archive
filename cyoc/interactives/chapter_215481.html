<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to stay behind with Christine in hopes of getting more answers as to what&#39;s happening. So after forming a mental link to stay in contact, Rusty quickly made his way into the woods after Sarah. You then turn your attention to Christine who is standing in the doorway looking to be in a daze. You decide to be cautious, after all you&#39;re still not sure what your dealing with. Extending your mind you begin to gently feel out Christine&#39;s consciousness, making sure not to pry into things that you have no business knowing. To your surprise she already seems to have erected a mental barrier. It didn&#39;t seem to be there to keep you out though, but to suppress something that was already inside. Despite your attempts at probing the barrier, you couldn&#39;t determine what it was that she was trying to keep at bay. From what you could determine it was actually the shear effort that she was putting into her mental barrier that was causing her to black out.<br />
<br />
She seems to be doing this instinctively, putting all of her mental focus into keeping it up. Despite your better judgement you walk up to Christine and attempt to reinforce her barrier, reducing the metal load on her. &quot;W-what... oh no how long have I been out?&quot; Christine asked no longer bearing the entire load. &quot;Only a few minutes,&quot; you reapplied as you began to help her into the house &quot;I should have probably mentioned this when we first met, but I happen to be psychic.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not looking into your thoughts or memories or anything,&quot; you reassure &quot;I&#39;m currently helping to reinforce a mental barrier you&#39;re using to keep... something imprisoned.&quot; &quot;Oh... that&#39;s you?&quot; She ask before taking a seat &quot;so I&#39;ve been blacking myself out trying to hold this... thing at bay.&quot; You nod in response before sitting in a chair opposite of her &quot;I have to say you seem to have an exceptionally strong mind, however I can&#39;t get a good read on what this is through your barrier.&quot; You take some time to get comfortable before leaning forward and asking &quot;Please... if it isn&#39;t to disturbing for you, could you describe it for me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Christine took some time to center herself before saying &quot;it&#39;s so strange, it&#39;s like a mass of tentacles, made of darkness.&quot; She starts to look uncomfortable and yet you sense a growing feeling of arousal as she continues to describe it. &quot;It&#39;s feels... warm...it&#39;s so wet...it feels so... good... why am I fighting this?&quot; Suddenly you sense her mental barrier drop allowing something to spread throughout her mind. It was unlike anything you had experienced before, a vast expanse of void, yet it moved with intent, weaving itself into Christine&#39;s mind. As it moved it destroyed nothing, simply becoming a part of her, giving her immense pleasure as it went. &quot;Oh yes!&quot; Christine exclaimed &quot;Sarah, I&#39;m sorry, I should have never have rejected this gift, I&#39;ll be joining you soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly the dark presence seems to take notice of you as it hijacks your mental connection and reaches out to you. You very briefly feel a wet warmth before breaking off the connection, and shielding yourself from further mental invasions. After coming back to your senses, you notice that Christine has lifted her dress and has begun to pleaser herself through her very wet panties. &quot;Mmm this feels so good, spreading through me, changing me.&quot; She murmured, the whites of her eyes shifting to a pitch black, the irises becoming a bright sky blue as the pupils dilated into narrow slits. The woman began to convulse as she fell to the floor, making you stand up to help her. But just as you got to her, three long black spines erupted from her back tearing through her clothes. A long thick tentacle like tail quickly began to grow, removing what remained of her clothes. She didn&#39;t appear to be experiencing any pain from her transformation, in fact she appears to be enjoying every sensation. <br />
<br />
You began to back away terrified of what you were witnessing as Christine stood up emitting a strange clicking sound. She locks eyes with you, her expression filled with lust and desire. She licked her lips, her tongue growing long and tapered as she walked closer to you. Her feet begin to shift as she walked, growing longer, forceing her to stand on her tows as they too begin to change. The tows grow longer and more flexible, the nails reshaping into sharp claws. The two outer tows begin to drift up her legs before shifting into opposing digits. Your back presses against a wall as a Christine&#39;s hand lands next to your head, effectively pinning you as it to began changing. The pinky shifting and changing becoming a second thumb as the nails reshape themselves into sharp claws. &quot;Thank you Marcia, mmm please allow me to give you this gift as well,&quot; she said, her teeth changing growing into sharp predatory jaws. The mutating woman let out a loud moan before fingering her dipping cunt her clitoris swelling, growing into a long tapered red shaft adorned with two rows of fleshy spines. &quot;Oh yes, I remember now, my daughter poured her seed into me,&quot; She said before pressing her new tool against your crotch &quot;I&#39;ll do the same for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
In you entire career dealing with the paranormal, you had never felt as vulnerable as you do now. You panic, unleashing a powerful psychic wave, and pushing everything away from you including Christine. Taking a few seconds to regain your senses, you look over at the mutant woman to see that she is already starting to get back up, her skin turning a dark gray. Taking what opportunity you could, you run. Realizing that she would easily catch you in the open, you run deeper into the house, looking for somewhere to hide. Thankfully the house was big, making it easier for you to find a good place to get lost in. Feeling that you&#39;ve gone far enough you quickly make your way into a random room, and barricade yourself inside. You then curl up in the corner of the room, you reinforce your mental barrier doing everything you could to hide you presence. You can&#39;t help but feel like a little girl again, hiding from monsters. <br />
<br />
You sit there completely silent for what feels like hours, Suddenly you hear a familiar clicking getting closer and closer. &quot;Oh Marcia, don&#39;t be afraid,&quot; the creature said &quot;let me show you how wonderful this is.&quot; You hear multiple things moving at once, as you hear her moving behind you, suddenly things in your room begin to move. Your heart sinks as you see all kinds of small objects begin to float into the air, what ever this was it has given her telepathic abilities. You quiet your mind, and cover you mouth making absolutely no sound, you become an object and must remain motionless. You begin to hear clicking right behind you, dark psychic tendrils slip through the wall, feeling there way throughout the room. Your mind remains silent, as they search the room, you do not move, even as they touch and feel your body. You have done your best to hide your human shape buy balling yourself up in the corner. But the thing that has made your blood run cold is that fact that despite being psychic projections, you could physically feel the warm wet tentacles on your skin. You endure, you almost black out, when finally the tendrils leave, and you hear the creature moving away. <br />
<br />
You continue to sit there for what feels like ages before you finaly let yourself relax. &quot;Fuck fuck fuck how could I have been so careless,&quot; you whisper to yourself. You have now realized what this was, and the realization shook you to your core. Back when you were still learning to control your psychic abilities, your mentor warned you against facing entities from the outer darkness. Creatures that existed beyond reality, what made them particularly dangerous to psychics however, was the fact that they exist both physically and psychically. This gives them a great deal of control over psychic abilities, allowing them to do things that any human psychic could only dream of. This included infecting psychics thought mental connections. &quot;Did I cut off the connection in time?&quot; you ask yourself before scanning your mind. You don&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary, but some how that doesn&#39;t make you feel any better, the memory of it remains. <br />
<br />
(Hay Marcy we have a problem,) the sudden voice made you jump out of your skin making you jump from your corner. You take a few moments to recompose yourself before replying (yeah no fucking shit!) (Oh, I&#39;m guessing things have gone sideways back there too than?) Rusty inquiries. (Yeah, you could say that,) you reply (turns out there infected with some kind of void parasite, which can infect psychics through mental connections.) (So, now I&#39;m hiding in some random bedroom, trying to hide from the monster that used to be Christine.) There was a long pause for a moment before Rusty finaly replies (I&#39;m sorry, it sounds like you&#39;re going through hell right now.) (Unfortunately things on my end haven&#39;t gone much better, I tracked Sarah fairly deep into the woods.) (Found her clothes, I guess that also explains why her footprints started changing, now it looks like the forest itself is trying to stop me.) (The forest is trying to stop you?!) you asked. (Yeah looks like tentacles have decided to start growing all over the place out here, I&#39;ve managed to get pretty far to be fair,) Rusty says. (But thing have gotten weirder, it looks like even the trees are now completely made of tentacles, honestly looks like a Lovecraftian paradise out here.) <br />
<br />
You think for a moment not expecting the situation to have gotten quite this bad, your heart grows heavy as you realize what you need to do. (I hate to even say this, but I&#39;m going to have to sever our mental link,) you say. (Are you insane!) Rusty exclaimed (no, absolutely not, this is way to dangerous of situation to be going it solo.) (look if I get infected it&#39;s going to use our link and infect you too.) you explain (I couldn&#39;t bear the thought if I had endangered you just to keep in touch.) (Make your way back in this direction, I&#39;ll try to get out of the house and meet you in the woods, okay.) (Okay, sounds like a plan.) Rusty says. (Oh, and make sure nothing cumes inside you,) you add. (WHAT!) Rusty exclaims before you sever the link, leaving your mind in silence.</p>
