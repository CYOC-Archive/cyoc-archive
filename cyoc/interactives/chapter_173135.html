<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlotte sighed as she packed up her desk.  She&#39;d been doing that a lot now.  To think her life had come to this, reduced to a tiny girl on the cusp of her teenaged years.  Fat lot of good that B.S. in Physics was going to do her now!<br />
<br />
Oh sure, Mr. Lawton wasn&#39;t going to fire her, but there wasn&#39;t a lot she could do from home.  She wanted to be in her lab, poking about with tiny bits of matter to learn how the universe worked.  The last thing she wanted to do is go home and deal with Ellen.<br />
<br />
Charlotte had doubts that what had affected them could truly be called a &#39;virus&#39;.  Viruses didn&#39;t work this way, not that biochemistry was her forte.  But some strange force had affected a growing number of women, including her.  She&#39;d gotten smaller at first, her facial features becoming delicate, and her whole body growing more girlish and delicate.  Then she started growing younger, which left her in her current state- a preteen girl just under 4&#39; 8&quot; tall.<br />
<br />
She had always been attractive, but now she was adorably cute and pretty.  Which, as Edward had said, had the effect of no one taking her seriously, least of all her daughter.  Ellen had inherited her mother&#39;s intelligence, but no her drive, her ambition to learn things.  No, all her 15 year old daughter seemed to want was to be popular and chase boys.<br />
<br />
Well.  That had changed slightly.<br />
<br />
Ellen had always been a pretty girl, and that hadn&#39;t changed.  What had changed, however, was her daughter&#39;s sexual orientation, and rather suddenly.  One night, Charlotte had come home late to find the lights were all out.  Going to her daughter&#39;s room, she heard the undeniable sounds of female pleasure.  She recalled blushing and feeling very turned on by the sound.  But still, Ellen had gone too far, bringing a boy into the house, let alone having sex with him...she was only 15?<br />
<br />
So she unlocked the door and flipped on the lights, only to find her daughter in bed with another girl, who was licking out Ellen&#39;s pussy.  Charlotte&#39;s first thoughts had been &#39;oh, what a pretty girl&#39;, followed by &#39;I wish she&#39;d do that to me!&#39;, both of which she pushed out of her head.<br />
<br />
Ellen had been furious, saying this was a betrayal of her trust.  Despite, you know, the fact that she had been the one to break the rules Charlotte had set down.  &quot;But it doesn&#39;t count, Danielle is a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Which, in all fairness, she had specified boys, but that was pedantry and she told her daughter as much, grounding her and taking her phone and internet privileges away.   They had screamed, Ellen had cried, and the whole business left Charlotte emotionally exhausted.<br />
<br />
But in bed, she couldn&#39;t get the two lovers out of her mind.  She had dabbled with girls when she was younger, but after marrying David, she hadn&#39;t really thought about that in a long time.  Of course, David was gone now, with a younger, prettier girl, the bastard.  And Ellen seemed to resent her for it...<br />
<br />
Charlotte had masturbated then, with an intensity she hadn&#39;t felt in years, and when she was done, she&#39;d passed out.<br />
The next day, she realized something was wrong when her clothing didn&#39;t fit right, and found she&#39;d shrunk several inches overnight.  Ellen didn&#39;t notice at first, but soon, her daughter was towering over her.  Sensing the dynamic had changed, she became more and more rebellious, and finally had pushed her down and said she was going out.<br />
<br />
That had made Charlotte feel especially vulnerable, and she cried for a long time.  Then she started noticing her body was not merely shrinking, but growing younger, even as her desire for sexual release increased, and she found herself looking at pictures of young women on the internet.<br />
<br />
By the time Ellen had come home, Charlotte was back in her 20&#39;s- she&#39;d avoided her then, but in the morning, there was no hiding the fact she was now a petite teenaged girl again.  Ellen had been fascinated by the transformation, and then...<br />
<br />
She&#39;d taken advantage of being taller and stronger than her mother, and forced herself on Charlotte.  Charlotte couldn&#39;t call it rape, because her protests had been faint- to her shock and horror, she&#39;d wanted every minute of it.<br />
<br />
It brought tears to her eyes even now, her clothing being torn away, her own daughter kissing her roughly, sucking on her breasts, her fingers between Charlotte&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d wanted it.  She&#39;d needed it.  She begged Ellen not to stop.  By nightfall, she looked about the same age as her own daughter.  By morning, she was no longer a teenager.  Ellen had become the adult.  Charlotte had no control over her.  She did whatever she wanted, and if what she wanted was Charlotte, the older woman couldn&#39;t resist her will.  She would cave after a token protest at best.  And worst of all, Ellen would make her beg.<br />
<br />
Her pride and confidence had been shattered, and now her boss had told her she couldn&#39;t be seen as an adult.  She ran into a bathroom stall and cried her eyes out.  What was she going to do?  She couldn&#39;t run away- she had a responsibility towards her daughter..<br />
<br />
And as much as she wished it was otherwise, she wanted Ellen to dominate her.  Force her into sexual acts she would have once thought were beyond the pale.  Even now, she wanted Ellen to force her to service her own daughter!<br />
<br />
She had no idea what she was going to do.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
