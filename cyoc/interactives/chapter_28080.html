<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The remainder of your party soon arrive at the centaur's communal hall. Inside, Ixion urges Michael and Lara to prepare more food for the table, whilst he and Themis open their books, ready to invoke the ceremony of initiation once more.<br />
<br />
Marina guides you next to the chalk circle, where you both sit down. At Ixion's command, you focus your gaze upon the candles Themis has lit - they help you attain a meditative state that holds off the creeping changes from your weretiger infection. For now, you ignore the itch of new fur spreading spreading along your arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I - I might hurt you, Marina,&quot; you gulp, as she rubs your forehead to calm you. You suppress the urge to purr.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might,&quot; she admits. &quot;But you can't infect me! We...centaurs...are immune to any were-creature infection. Don't ask me how I know... I just do!&quot;<br />
<br />
You ears seem to twitch, as you hear Rachel talking to Deirdre and Felicia, nearby. Both of the other ladies have seemed...unfocused...since they heard you express your desire to become a centaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they're going to do to Ben what they did with Marina?&quot; Deirdre sounds aghast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rachel tells her. &quot;Both Ben and I want this, Deirdre! We want to join the centaurs - and be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you say that by seeing the...change...for ourselves, we won't forget you...&quot; Felicia shakes her head, bewildered. &quot;Well - you've told me about Anarosa... Except I still can't remember her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because you've not yet seen her as she is now - a satyress!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens to me and Felicia, once you and Ben have been...changed?&quot; Deirdre looks sadly at Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to decide for yourselves... I'm sorry, Deirdre, for leaving you two alone - but my place is with Ben!&quot;<br />
<br />
Deirdre tearfully smiles and gives Rachel a quick hug. &quot;I hope it works out for you both!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ixion trots over to you, and you pay attention to him. &quot;We are ready to apply the amplified spell to cleanse you, and admit you into the haras. Are you ready, Ben?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yyrress...,&quot; you growl, and stand up. You find yourself unable to undo your clothes with your paws - and Marina helps you undress, instead of you slashing your way free. Rachel eagerly dashes over and strips off. Both of you gaze at your discarded clothes, knowing that you'll never be able to wear your shoes and lower garments again - or so you hope.<br />
<br />
Soon, Rachel is standing besides you - naked apart from her bra, and, of course, her spectacles. You gaze with a smile at her slender, attractive, human form. As for yourself, you only have on one item now - your St. Christopher. The silver of its touch is making you itch...<br />
<br />
Rachel holds back her fear of what might go wrong. Managing a nervous smile, she holds out a hand. &quot;Together, Ben?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tothgerhurr.&quot; Your curled-up lips break into another smile, and you wrap your non-injured arm around hers. &quot;Furreverr!&quot; you add. As one, you step into the chalk circle. You are watched with anticipation by both human and centaur eyes.<br />
<br />
Ixion and Themis read aloud the rites from their tomes. You try to control your mounting anticipation by focusing on both the candles and Rachel. Nevertheless, short fur is sprouting on your face and chest - and you are becoming aroused by the smell of apprehension emitted by Rachel. You try to push aside the desire to bite into Rachel, to turn her into a weretiger - and concentrate on what you've pledged yourselves to. The vision of you both galloping through woods and meadows on four hooves, laughing with joy, fills your heart.<br />
<br />
Ixion and Themis finish their chanting. Ixion gazes at you with concern - but also with hope. &quot;Rachel, Ben - I must ask you the question. Do you both confirm your wish to become centaurs - and become honoured members of our haras for the rest of your extended lives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Rachel beams, sounding like a bride at her wedding ceremony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yyrress...&quot; You nod, squeezing Rachel - trying to avoid cutting your sharpened nails into her. Meanwhile, a tail is starting to grow from your rear...<br />
<br />
Ixion nods and smiles. &quot;Then be welcome, my children - to your new family, and your new race!&quot;<br />
<br />
Points of sparkling lights - identical to what you saw at Marina's initiation - appear and slowly swirl in the air around you both. The animal inside you suddenly causes you to snarl. Rachel gasps, but doesn't let go. Suddenly, the lights merge with you - leaving a tingling sensation.<br />
<br />
Now a band of light forms around your head and spins in a downward spiral to your feet. A warm rush of energy sweeps through your body. Gradually, your fur shrinks and disappears into your pores. Your hair returns to its natural colour, the fangs revert to human canines - and before long, you are flexing fingers once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben! You're completely human again!&quot; Rachel hugs you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tharr-thank god!&quot; you gasp, embracing her. The St. Christopher no longer itches against your furless skin.<br />
<br />
The band of light that has cleansed you rises to head-height. You and Rachel watch as it splits into two white balls of plasma-like energy that hover before your faces. Your audience all hold themselves still. You entwine fingers with Rachel.<br />
<br />
Then, the balls of light zip into both your chests, simultaneously. As one, Rachel and you give moans of pleasure, as a sensation of pure bliss floods your beings. Straight away, you feel fur growing on you again - but this time, it's only from your hips downward. A glance at Rachel's legs reveals they are becoming coated with thick brown hairs.<br />
<br />
There's a churning around your buttocks - and then your body cells around the base of your torso multiply like crazy. Your groin gets pulled back and in-between your changing legs. You lose your balance, and twist to your side. With her hand around yours, Rachel gives a cry and slumps against you. Consequently, you get to feel each other's altering, growing forms, as you both develop the lower bodies of horses. Your manhood, now rear the end of your enlarged rear, stiffens, and becomes bonded to your furred under-quarters by a swiftly-grown sheath.<br />
<br />
Next, you feel bones force their way out from you, and your lengthened body - now occupied by a second set of organs, bones, blood vessels, and so on - becomes supported by the rear legs growing into place. They make contact with Rachel's new limbs, also - as she transforms in time with you.<br />
<br />
Now the toes merge with the hardening balls of your feet. Within seconds they turn into hooves - and are soon complimented by the formation of a second pair. The skin of your enlarged body tickles as equine hairs grown into place. Rachel tries to push herself off you - and her new fur brushes against yours. You gasp as you feel your tail burst from the base of your lengthened spine. It drapes itself over your rear legs.<br />
<br />
The last changes kick in. There's a tugging on your ears - and you reach up to examine them. They've become slightly pointed.<br />
<br />
Both you and Rachel lay on the stone floor, recovering your breaths. You look down at your soul mate and return her wide-eyed stare at you. Your fingers gently brush her faintly-pointed, cute-looking ears. They twitch. The transformation caused some discomfort - but no pain. Yet, it was exhilarating...<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel... Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ben. That was amazing! How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel terrific! But your shoulder is pressing into my foreleg!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... I'll try to get up!&quot; Rachel folds her legs in, and pushes herself off you. Then, slowly and carefully, she rises to her full height upon her four hooves. She now stands as high as Marina, and is almost the height of Themis and Ixion. Her mid-brown hair has lengthened to her shoulder blades, and is now matched by her sleek, beautiful, brown fur - the colouring of a domestic horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look...fabulous.&quot; You gasp with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Rachel twists round to admire her new body. She strokes her coat with growing wonder. &quot;We're both...fabulous...now, Ben!&quot; she giggles. She stretches out her hand to help you up.<br />
<br />
You shake your head. &quot;I need to learn how to do this.&quot; And, following Rachel's method, you stand up on your hooves - and proudly present your new form to everyone present.<br />
<br />
Whoa! You're taller now! Rachel drinks in your equine body, and smiles. &quot;You're a mustang, Ben!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking tentative first steps towards each other, you and Rachel embrace, and cry tears of relief and joy. Together, you thank Ixion and Themis, acknowledging them as your haras leaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...! What about our bags at the hotel?&quot; Rachel asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will contact the administration, and tell them to send your items here. At the same time, they will be told of Cedius's plans to free his captured rogue satyrs,&quot; Ixion answers her. He smiles and shakes hands with you both. &quot;Our home is now your home!&quot;<br />
<br />
He moves aside. Marina trots over, kissing you both on the cheeks. Then Michael and Lara warmly welcome you and Rachel. Now Themis urges you two over to the table, which is loaded with food. She kisses Rachel and yourself - then leaves, smiling. &quot;Feast, children! Ixion and I will return soon. We must make plans to deal with Cedius.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling hungry, you pick something at random from the table. Appropriately enough, it is a large carrot. You present it to Rachel. &quot;Can I tempt you - my lady mare?&quot; you tease her.<br />
<br />
Rachel grins and swishes her tail. &quot;Certainly - my gentleman stallion!&quot; She pokes one end of the carrot into her mouth - then grabs your head and guides you to the other end. You both munch your way through the tasty vegetable, and end up locking lips together. That, in turn, is following by a passionate kiss-and-cuddle session - which is only interrupted by the rumbling of your collective four stomachs.<br />
<br />
Laughing, you both tuck into the food. Seeing Deirdre and Felicia standing nearby, lost amongst the centaurs, you invite them both to join you. Smiling nervously, they grab some bread and cooked meat - and relax with you and Rachel.</p>
