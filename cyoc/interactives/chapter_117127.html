<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 4 am when Matt woke up suddenly. When awake he couldn&#39;t move at all. He also had trouble breathing. He closed his eyes again and tried to calm his mind. He knew this feeling, he&#39;d felt it before. It was sleep paralysis. But what made him curious was how he didn&#39;t have a lucid dream before that. Usually, in a dream like that he could do whatever he want...<br />
<br />
Matt tried to make his body function again, but all he could do was move his neck and twitch his big toes. It was so dark as well. Matt kept his eyes closes, as he knew he would hallucinate and see things that weren&#39;t there when he opened them. He started feeling strange cramps, everywhere within his body. His muscles were burning and sore, and he was also barely able to breathe. He tried to gasp for air as the cramps spread around his body in painful waves, starting from his head, down towards his toes. Matt clutched his teeth and fought back tears, he still couldn&#39;t move and tried to keep his eyes shut. Even his inside organs managed to malfunction. He&#39;d felt like having a heart attack for a while, but he stayed conscious. In reality his heart was racing 2 times faster than what was healthy. His stomach burnt the most of all. It was like some new organ was forming underneath his stomach, making him want to throw up. However, he lied on his back, and was barely able to move.<br />
<br />
After 5 minutes the horrible pains finally subsided, leaving him in a puddle of sweat. He also regained his movements again, first with slow twitched in his fingers, afterwards moving his legs. After 10 more minutes of lying down, with uncomfortable breathing, he stood up and ran to the bathroom in the darkness. He fell on his knees and bent over the toilet bowl, throwing up afterwards. After sitting there for a few minutes, Matt shambled back to his bed, but feeling it covered in sweat, he decided to sleep on the bench in the living room just for the night. He was still overheated anyway, so he didn&#39;t feel like taking any covers with him. He lied down on the bench and tried to lie in a good position. He was exhausted from the sudden feelings in his body, and still felt a somewhat burning feeling. He quickly dozed in and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
In the far distance, Matt heard the beeping sound of an alarm clock, his alarm clock. He opened his eyes and tried reaching for it, as it always was on the left side of his bed, where he&#39;d placed it on a night stand. He didn&#39;t feel any alarm clock however and the annoying sound also didn&#39;t quit. &quot;Oh that&#39;s right&quot;, Matt thought. &quot;I slept on the bench tonight&quot;. Still drousy, Matt walked back to his bedroom, to hit his alarm clock on the top and causing it to quit the sound. The air in his bedroom was very thick and felt like it lacked oxygen. Matt moved the curtains in front of the bedroom window aside, noticing it was still dark. Why did he set the timer on 6 am again? He twisted the handle and opened the window for a bit.<br />
<br />
Matt leaped a bit when behind him, all of a sudden the alarm clock went off again. Matt scratched his forehead, and switched off all timers that were planned for him. He wasn&#39;t exactly a morning person, so waking him up would require the stress of three set timers and one hour late for work. Matt sighed a breath of relief and brought his hand to his chest, to feel if his heart was still beating after all that nonsense. Matt felt something else though...<br />
<br />
He breathed in a rush of fresh air as he opened his eyes and massaged his chest with his hand. All of a sudden he felt that his neck was itchy as well, and why was he breathing so sharply? He looked down at his hand, but it seemed like nothing was wrong. What was he grabbing though? Matt massaged it a little more, it was like a lump on his chest, and it almost felt pleasurable. Moving away his hand from his chest, he saw something poke out of his pajama shirt. He made a questioning look and brought his fingers to it again, giving it a twist. &quot;Yowch!&quot; Matt yelped, in a much higher pitch than normal. It hurt, but felt very nice at the same time.<br />
<br />
Matt moved his hands to the bottom of his shirt, so he could pull it over his head. As he did that, he threw it behind him, onto the bed. A sudden breeze of fresh air from the window made him shivers, and his nipples got erect even more, but painfully. He stared down at the two lumps in shock. It was just as he suspected, he had breasts...<br />
<br />
Matt twisted them again, this time more gently. He let out a small shriek like he never did before. He then looked at what was further down on his body. His expression changed from aroused back to worried again as he rushed towards the nearest mirror in the house. He stumbled into the bathroom and onto the ground. His arms blocked his fall, but he still managed to squish his breasts. Matt lied there for a few seconds. The tiles had an underfloor and it gave a nice feeling on his nipples.<br />
<br />
Matt stood up, and faced the mirror. He gasped in surprise. In front of him, on the mirror, was a girl. The girl had curled hair in a ponytail, explaining the itching on his neck and the feeling of his hair being pulled. The girl&#39;s hair was brownish and she had bright, intelligent blue eyes. Her eyelashes were long, and the lips had a nice red tint. He looked down and covered up the breasts, thinking about how any woman would do that when she was stripped and a man saw her. The girl had a fit body and even a six-pack. He then saw the small line of pubic hair reach out from his boxers to her bellybutton. <br />
<br />
He moved her right hand towards his boxers, concentrated as memories flowed back about last night. How he created a 3D-model which looked exactly like this. Meanwhile, Matt felt inside his boxers, searching for his member, but he failed. He desperately searched more until he suddenly buckled his knees in pleasure. &quot;I&#39;ve found her clit...&quot; Matt stated. He gently rubbed around it, as it reacted with giving him a pleasured feeling. He rubbed it, making it feel even better, but forcing him to sit down against the bathroom wall. He found her round ass sitting on the warmed floor, while her back was leaning against the cold, white-tiled wall. He didn&#39;t care though, one feeling topped it all. The pleasure was so intense! Matt&#39;s breathing got quicker, as he felt his insides retract all of a sudden sometimes. His knees were against each other tightly, while the rubbing of her clit caused Matt to reach a fase he&#39;d never felt before. It felt one hundred times better than masturbating with a penis, this piece, was so small, yet so arousing.<br />
<br />
Matt thought about what more features a girl had which guys didn&#39;t and he thought about what was underneath the clit. While still rubbing the clit by moving a finger down its side, he felt around for a bit. It was then that he found a tight opening. He moved her free hand towards it and then pulled on the sides. To his surprise it stretched with it quite a lot, opening her cunt even more. Matt held it open with the thumb and index finger of her right hand, and dipped two fingers of her left in it. Matt moaned deeply. Having her fingers going in and out of her pussy, his newfound sex tool, Matt came close to extasy. He continued the thrusting in her pussy and restarted rubbing her clit. His moaning got quicker, his breathing got sharper and he felt the contractions in his stomach appear more and more. The build up was amazing as it kept on going, increasing his heartrate as he started thrusting her cunt quicker and quicker. It went on and on as the climax reached it peak. Suddenly, along with an ecstatic climax, pussy juice sprayed out of her cunt and landed on the tiled floor. Matt let out one last long moan, and he came.</p>
