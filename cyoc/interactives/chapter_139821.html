<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time I had walked back to my room, the others had already flipped away from the news and turned on the gaming console left in our room. I had no idea why they&#39;d provide that of all things. Must&#39;ve been to keep us from being bored and stupid, but it was a weird thing to spend money on.<br />
<br />
They were all so engrossed in the game, they didn&#39;t even notice me coming in. I didn&#39;t know what to talk to the others about first. There was just so much to unpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you guys know that they&#39;re taking our cellphones away. This fucking faggot police guy literally cut off my conversation with Lisa and threatened me just like the other guy did in class,&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, they told us we had to drop them off before we could leave the &#39;welcome meeting&#39;. Were you not paying attention?&quot; Jacob asked. Honestly, I was so worried about Lisa that I didn&#39;t bother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they took away the phones we were using and any other electronic devices we had. Said something about only using the stuff they provided us to prevent panic. I highly doubt it&#39;s gonna be effective though, considering I managed to sneak my phone out of there and your dumb ass did it without trying,&quot; Jacob continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, cool, gimme. I&#39;m calling Lisa back,&quot; I ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you an imbecile? Assuming they haven&#39;t shut down the majority of phone poles, since no one can monitor them with the curfew, they&#39;re probably tracking every call that goes through them. We&#39;ll be outed in a matter of minutes. I&#39;m surprised you managed to last five seconds with a connection failure and without being caught,&quot; he fired back. I can&#39;t say I knew exactly what he meant by that word vomit, but I could get the gist. I&#39;m just glad the man didn&#39;t start going into the technical jargon of the situation. For a blonde, Jacob could sure talk for hours about the nerdiest of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t you wanna talk to your girlfriend too? I&#39;m sure Jess must be worried sick,&quot; I weakly countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m worried about her, too, but she&#39;s probably the smartest woman at this University. She&#39;ll know why I&#39;m not calling her and she&#39;s probably telling the girls to do the same thing I&#39;m telling you to do. So back off,&quot; the blonde retorted. I couldn&#39;t do anything but fume in silence. His argument was logical and couldn&#39;t be broken. Hell, even he knew that he would win from the start; he hadn&#39;t even looked away from the screen the entire time and was demolishing Chase and Taylor in the FPS they were playing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine,&quot; I resigned, plopping myself onto my bed. &quot;By the way, is Daniel okay? He almost ran me over trying to get to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He mumbled something about needing to take a shower and left. Though I think he might&#39;ve pissed himself. The dude looked scared shitless,&quot; Taylor explained. I felt even worse about getting so angry before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be fine! Come on, play with us,&quot; Chase encouraged, tossing me a controller. I couldn&#39;t pass on an opportunity to beat the shit out of these losers in any game, so I shut up and joined in. The game was literally just a generic FPS. It seemed to take inspiration from a ton of games, but I had never heard of it before. Regardless, watching me blow my friends up on screen was just the satisfaction I needed to forget about the shit show that was the last few hours.<br />
<br />
And that was how we spent most of the day. Eventually, Daniel came back in a different set of clothes and wordlessly took up a controller, not acknowledging his odd behavior. For some reason though, he chose to stand for the entire time. Something about wanting to get some blood flowing. Honestly, we kinda just let Daniel be Daniel. I had a sneaking suspicion the dude might&#39;ve been a fag; he was the only one of us without a girlfriend despite being uncharacteristically buff. I didn&#39;t care, just as long as he didn&#39;t actually do anything faggy. I hated that shit and I&#39;m glad the president is gonna do something about it soon enough. If not, once I get my law degree, I&#39;ll fix it myself. But until then, as long as I didn&#39;t have to be around it, I would be fine.<br />
<br />
By the time we realized how long we&#39;d been playing, it was already nighttime. Jason and Chase had already gone back to their rooms, leaving the three of us bored out of our minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, this is gonna get old real quick,&quot; I noted. &quot;We can&#39;t even go to the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two shared my feelings. The gym was the one thing we all bonded over, even with Jacob and Chase. We all started at different times, but eventually we became a close knit crew because of it. Being unable to go would be a real detriment to our gains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it, I&#39;m gonna do as much of a workout as I can here. You two are welcome to join if you want,&quot; Taylor announced, getting into a push-up position. He quickly began doing reps and I considered joining in. I looked at Daniel, who seemed enraptured by Taylor&#39;s movements. Yeah, the dude was definitely a fag. At least that meant if he does get infected, he&#39;ll get fixed, in a way.<br />
<br />
Daniel quickly noticed my look and shook his head. &quot;I&#39;ll join in,&quot; he declared, following Taylor&#39;s movements. Soon, I did the same. We all had workouts prepared in case we weren&#39;t able to go to the gym for whatever reason, so we quickly occupied ourselves.<br />
<br />
It was about ten minutes in when we heard it. It was clearly someone outside the window but the moan was almost impossibly loud. And undeniably... slutty? I was convinced that it had to be a girl, but she was clearly more turned on than she&#39;d ever been in her life.<br />
<br />
All three of us stopped to look out the window. We were only on the third floor of the building, so we couldn&#39;t make out who the two individuals were but we could clearly see what they were doing. They were by the sidewalk, where the sign for our dorm stood passively while the two fucked against it. The man wasn&#39;t very muscled (we were all clearly stronger than him), but it was enough to pick up his partner, who was half way up the sign with legs wrapped tightly around the man on top. And fuck, they were loud. If I were asleep, I definitely would&#39;ve been woken up by it.<br />
<br />
It was weird though. I mean, besides the loud, public fucking. The shrieks coming out of the person getting fucked were clearly high-pitched, but the person itself looked almost flat-chested. At the same time, the legs were clearly long, lanky and kinda feminine. It just seemed weird.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t survey the two anymore, since before they could continue any further, an armored truck basically swerved around the corner and stopped in front of the two. Quickly, five men in hazmat/SWAT gear rushed forward, guns locked and loaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop immediately and surrender!&quot; one of the officers yelled. It looked like the two fuckers couldn&#39;t even hear them. The officer repeated himself one more time to no avail. Then, two officers slowly approached the couple. I couldn&#39;t see what happened next, but when they were done, the couple was on the ground. Whether they were unconscious or dead, I couldn&#39;t tell, but two of the other officers quickly loaded the couple onto two gurneys and brought them into the truck. Before we knew it, they were gone, and we were speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;They couldn&#39;t have... They couldn&#39;t have actually killed them, right?&quot; I asked, unsure of myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it. They wouldn&#39;t have brought out gurneys if they cared about their lives. It looked like they were be transported somewhere? Maybe a medical facility? Or a prison?&quot; Taylor reasoned. In all honesty, he was probably right, but it still didn&#39;t exactly leave us calm.<br />
<br />
A heavy pause was in the air after that. I looked at the other two, especially Daniel. He looked deathly afraid. I had to calm him down. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re probably right. Besides, even if they were infected, it&#39;s not like it would be a problem unless either of you were planning to fuck on a sign, right? And if you were, I&#39;m sure that there are plenty of sexier signs out there. I&#39;m sure this is just a &#39;sign&#39; that we&#39;ll be safe,&quot; I explained.<br />
<br />
The pun was supposed to just make the other two roll their eyes and walk away, just as they usually do, but this time something different happened with Daniel. He giggled. The fag actually fucking giggled.<br />
<br />
Taylor and I just stared at the black haired man in shock. He stared back, wide-eyed. An even worse silence settled in. Just as we were about to question him, knock came from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Food is here!&quot; a staff member called. Apparently, they were bringing it to our individual dorms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta go!&quot; Daniel spat, before rushing out of the room. It looked like he was having trouble running away. Why was he wearing such tight jeans?<br />
<br />
Taylor and I just stared at each other in utter disbelief.</p>
