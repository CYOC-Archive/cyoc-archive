<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"What do you think?" the four and a half foot tall half-human, half-raccoon man asked as Sedona took a step back outside.  Nook looked a bit like he had dollar signs in his eyes as he waited on her answer, and that just made her sigh a bit.</p>

<p>Thinking it over for a moment, she glanced back at the closed door "Well…" she began, not sure what to say.  It really wasn't a very nice place to stay, but she wasn't sure she was prepared to sleep in a cave.  The Inn was attached to a bar and a restaurant, so she figured things just wouldn't be as quite as they would be inside of her own little home.  "…its nothing special, Nook… you know that," Sedona offered, looking over at him.  His eyes dimmed a bit, though she continued, "But, seriously, I just want some quite time.  It's been a long flight, a long drive, a long ride, and I've just been transformed into something other than human.  I'm tired, I'm worn, and it <i>is</i> four walls to myself," she said, looking to him.  "I'll take it."</p>

<p>"Glorious," he smiled under the sunny late winter sky.  He reached reached into his pocket and pulled out a little silver rod that looked a little like a drum stick.  He waved it over the mailbox at the wooden stand beeped softly.  Smiling at her, Nook reached up with the wand to the tag upon her ear and it also beep.  "Home is all yours for the duration of your visit."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh… and how many Bells is that?" she smirked.</p>

<p>"No Bells," he grinned at her.  "T.F.P.C. anyway," he said to her.  "No, your's is Free says my little pad," he said, looking at a device that resembled an iPhone.  "You're entitled to a single full meal a day for Free as well.  Everything else, cloths, additional food, designs for your room, etcetera… those are all paid for with Transformation Park Credits," he said to her with a smile, answering her question before she asked it.  "You can chop wood, hunt for food, fish, plant gardens, or any number of other community-oriented tasks in order to gain Credits," he said to her.</p>

<p>"And chores for animals too lazy to do simple tasks themselves, yes?" the she-wolf smiled as she put her hands on her hips.  She stuck her tongue out at Nook and winked at him.  "Just kiddin' with ya, Nook.  Be well.  I'm out," she waved over her shoulder to him as she turned and opened the door to head back inside her little house.</p>

<p>"Night, Sedona," he said to her even though it was the middle of the afternoon.  "Sleep well."</p>

<hr>

<p>Somewhere in a time that didn't feel quite right, Howard Johnson was a thirteen year old boy.  He lived up on a mountainside with his parents overlooking a lake a ways down below that his parents would still own nearly twenty years later.  There was a dock with the family fishing boat tied up there, and a trail that lead all the way back up and around to the stone steps that laid the path on up to the Johnson family home.  Two cars sat in the driveway, one an old-style hybrid gas and electric S.U.V. and the other a family van, newer, and fully electric.</p>

<p>The house itself resembled a log cabin and had a wide if deeply sloped back yard that on one end slid down towards the lake and on the other climbed higher upwards towards the peak of the mountain.  All of the land around the home was covered in deep forest except for the closest portion of the back yard near to the house which had been leveled out somewhat when the basement below had been created a scant fifteen years earlier.  The house itself was a marvel of modern design, created by Howard's father himself all those years earlier.  He was a carpenter of some renown, and he had driven himself to create an idyllic location for his growing family to live.</p>

<p>At this time, there was something very strange about this whole setting, but Howard took no notice of how the sky appeared a deep purple in the middle of the afternoon or how the lake itself was somehow a deep red in color.  All this would come back to him later as he woke up as Sedona in a single-room home somewhere far from here in the Future.  For now, it was just a simple afternoon that was being lived in the here and now.</p>

<hr>

<p>Out on the back porch, the young Howie Johnson called out for his siberian husky Segoni to come in for the night.  "Sego!" he would call out one of the dog's many nicknames.  "Seg-Seg!  Come here!  Time for nappies!" the young boy would call out.  Sure enough, from the edge of the woods appeared Segoni as a husky… but as the canine slid silently across the empty back yard, his appearance bulked up slightly into a wolf-husky mix.  His paws made a deep thumping on the earth that seemed to shake the woods and the boy as he approached the back steps of the home.</p>

<p>The dog was huge.  As the scene shifted to the kitchen for Segoni to have finished his meal, he looked down at Howard, his muzzle nearly five foot off the ground.  No, the size of the dog was not accurate to history, but this was a dream, and he always remembered the dog being so much larger than him.  Rubbing the scruff of the neck on his dog, Seg-Seg's leg started kicking in place as he enjoyed the attention.  His neck extending backwards, the wolf's muzzle reached up straight into the air, his body twitching with the loving scritching that his young master was giving him.</p>

<p>Howard stopped his attention giving and sat back on his bed as the two of them where now in his room.  Segoni was at the foot of it where he usually slept, his head coming back down from the attention he had just been given.  But, unexpectedly, the giant wolf (which now was nearly the size of the whole bed) lunged his head forward and started licking Howie all over his little face, returning the loving affection he had felt just a moment ago.  At first Howard found the slavering of his best friend to be quite nasty, but soon enough Segoni's tongue just began to tickle his whole face and made him laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Howard hugged his arms around Seg-Seg's neck and gave a lick of his own.  It was Segoni's turn to be surprised, though, because his young master's face had extended outward into the older, larger, canine muzzle of Howard's current form of Sedona.  As she returned his affection the young boy's chest inflated into the six breasts that Sedona would have in another nineteen years or so, fur trailing down from under his chin across them and towards his groin as his reproductive organs slowly inverted themselves into something more akin to an aged female and wolf.</p>

<p>She was larger now as the curls spilled down from the back of her head and her arms leaned out into the much larger and leaner muscled arms of the hybrid wolf-human that Sedona would be some many years later.  Her size now matched his, and they both barely fit into the room.  She licked and laughed at Segoni's affection as his chest and legs reshaped themselves something a ways away from pure wolf and something more akin to bipedal like a human.  His paws reached forward onto her breasts and began to caress them as his fingers also took a human like shape just as hers had.</p>

<p>"I love you, Seggie," she yuffed to his ears as she leaned up against him, throwing him backwards off the bed in a playful manner.  He hit the floor but bounded up back onto all four legs instantly, taking in the appearance of his mate as she had turned over, front onto the bed, with her legs reaching backwards and off of it.  A tail rightfully extended up from her ass, covering her rear for just a moment before it flicked in the air and went to one side.  Her young human boy legs spread to show her dripping wet sex and Segoni stood up onto two legs and howled his claim to her as his mate.  Stepping forward, his cock long since slid from his sheath, he entered her for the first time with a careful but deliberate force.</p>

<p>Sedona almost couldn't hold her place on the bed until her legs finally finished their shift into her powerful humanoid ones from some time in the Future.  Her ass filled out more plump, and the size and strength of her form was now able to meet Seg-Seg's thrust blow for blow.  In her mind she could see the innards of her tunnel and the pink shaft that rushed in and then out, over and over again, each time making it further than the last, bringing her closer and closer to that final moment of release.</p>

<p>Did it go on forever, or did it end too soon?  Sedona couldn't tell, for the dream itself had shredded time and reality to make something that never was a picture for the hear and now.  His balls swinging back and forth, hitting her in the front as his knot expanded to a size that would never fit inside of her.  A moment of fear in her lust as Segoni unleashed a growl of ownership and power as he pulled back out from her and slammed himself inside of her with enough force that the size that was too large for her <i>would</i> fit… he would <i>make</i> it.</p>

<p>She felt and yet also somehow saw as the world around the two of them bent inward towards her as she begged her lungs to take a breath.  The shock of his girth seemed to fill her up to her eyeballs to the point that she felt like they would erupt from her skull.  The room all around flex towards the lovers to the point where it might crush them, but it expanded outward again as she took in a deep breath that removed all color from the sky outside the high windows of the room and made the bright stars of the night come into full focus even from outside.  Everything about the room and the world began to shake as she shuttered over the length of him with pictures and trophies shaking themselves from the walls and shelves to come crashing to the floor as she came and came.</p>

<p>Segoni howled his victory as he held onto her around her chest and let loose his seed within her.  She found the will to push up on her arms so that her back was closer to his chest as the two of them continued to shake with trusts that were no longer needed.  Her muzzle shook and weakly reached up for the howl she held in order to join his as a different pitch, her eyes closing as she felt complete in this final moment.  Segoni reached his hands around across her chest as she felt that he might hold onto her with his very being… and as his howl came to a close, he reached his head forward over to her shoulder and nipped it deeply, drawing just a bit of blood to mark her as his own.</p>

<p>Leaning his head forward over Sedona's upper body, Segoni turned his face toward her and began licking her on the muzzle tenderly.  "I love you too," he said… but she already <i>knew</i> that…</p>

<hr>

<p>Sedona moaned a low and pleasing reply to Segoni's attentions as the two laid there locked in place together for what was sure to be a long time indeed… but as he turned to rest against her, butt to butt like wolves do… she felt him vanish from within her softly as the thrusting had come completely to a slow end.  "Segoni?" she asked, slowly opening her eyes and turning her head to see where he had gone as such a caring and unifying moment.<p>

<p>Imagine her horror when the male mind of the thirty-two year old Howard awoke to find himself in Sedona's body like the end of some horror movie (albeit a somewhat perverted one).  She was laying on her six breasts that she <i>knew</i> hadn't been there shortly before she fell asleep, with her legs spread behind her and her tail off over to one side.  Feeling wet up her belly, Sedona cautiously reached under herself to between her legs to find that, one way or another, she had brought a wetness to the bedspread there.</p>

<p>An immediate reaction to push herself out of the bed and roughly to her knees on the floor was joined by a disgusted reaction to <i>whatever</i> that had meant (the dream <i>or</i> the wetness).  The moonlight outside allowed in just enough brightness through the upper windows that she could barely see her sex had puffed up and her nipples, all eight, were now standing erect.  She leaned her head forward, her hands coming up to cup her muzzle as her tail wrapped around her side as she closed her eyes again.</p>

<p>She sobbed softly to herself.  "I can't believe it," she said softly to herself, "That was…"</p></p>
