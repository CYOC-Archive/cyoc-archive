<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley and Sithathor lay there in the grove for some time, recovering from the vigorous mating that Ashley had taken to easily, instinctively even. Their large bodies heaved with each breath into their cavernous lungs, something that he found strangely calming, the sweet, sweaty smell of Sithathor against him, her eyes closed, her own breath softly billowing from the nostrils of her snout. The shadows grew long by the time the two bovine creatures rose from their bed of long grass and wildflowers.<br />
<br />
Though their initial contact had been a matter of impulse, instant physical attraction and biological imperative, at each subsequent gathering one of them would begin to automatically seek out the other. Both of them had done some dating when they had been human, and in some ways, this was no different. They would still ask after each other&#39;s work lives, and about their respective friendships. In particular, Sithathor was interested to hear about how Monica&#39;s decision to join the Mermaid colony was progressing.<br />
<br />
Sithathor&#39;s transition began at an earlier age than Ashley&#39;s and with the consent of her parents. and so she felt compelled to enquire about how Ashley&#39;s parents had responded to their daughter&#39;s choice to become a male bull, and to provide any support that she could. &quot;I&#39;ve not been able to reach my Dad yet&quot; he confided, &quot;I hope she understands. When she was regressed, we had so much in common, and we got really close, I&#39;m worried she might see it as a betrayal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sithathor placed her thick &quot;fingers&quot; in his and squeezed softly. &quot;Maybe she will be sad, but I am sure she will understand that the change you have made has made you happy. What about your Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mom has been great, you know she&#39;s so young again, younger than me, and a Martian. She was really encouraging. It really made me believe I had made the right decision.&quot; The female Minotaur nuzzled against him and replied &quot;Did something else help reinforce that?&quot; she said. It was hard for them to actually smile, though the corners of her lower lip did manage to turn upwards. Ashley grunted in appreciation at the body contact, feeling Sithathor&#39;s large furry breasts pressing against his chest. &quot;Oh yes, THAT definitely helped.&quot; he responded. Though he had mated with others at Gatherings since, Sithathor had been his first as a Minotaur and the memory of the vigorous, powerful sex was vivid, and when the pair of them had joined their enormous bodies subsequently, he found himself enjoying the experience more than with the other bovine women. Biologically they seemed highly compatible, and their shared experience of transitioning in terms of both gender and species contributed to their growing closeness.<br />
<br />
It was in the third month of their association that Ashley stopped Sithathor as they made their way to their favourite grove during a gathering, their hooves having left a trail of imprints in the soft, mossy grass.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked him, momentarily wondering at his seeming reluctance, as he hadn&#39;t ever shown any hesitation in making for their appointed mating place, indeed, she could feel the heat from his burgeoning, snub-nosed erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sithathor, before we go into the grove, I wish to ask you, would you consider being, officially, my Mate?&quot; It seemed odd to say &quot;Married&quot;, that was something humans did, though the emotional attachment was similar, two humans could not be connected physically in the way they were. She blinked her large, cow eyes at him, and nodded her horned head softly. &quot;Yes, yes I will&quot; she told him, and Ashley leant down to meet his muzzle with hers, their thick pink tongues licking each other in the approximation of a kiss.<br />
<br />
They moved into the grove, twilight falling around them, lending the grass-filled meadow-like space an orange ethereal quality. Ashley could feel his member swelling with his hot blood as Sithathor led him to the middle of the glade, by which time blood was throbbing in his ears, his long, veiny, dark skinned shaft curved with his hardness, the need to mate almost al-consuming. Sithathor looked over her shoulder at him and made her mating call, a plaintive boving lowing. This was no time for human speech and she fell onto all fours, her tail raising to display her thick lipped, oversized cow vagina, drooling thick wetness.<br />
<br />
Ashley moved in behind her, panting, and wasted little time in mounting her, his 800-pound bulk completely dwarfing her not unimpressive size and he slid almost all of his 3 foot cock into her with a bellow of satisfaction. He thought he would never, ever tire of that feeling, the steaming hot glory of a minotaur female - this minotaur female closing their velvety flesh around his member. A flash of amusement came into his mind for a moment regarding the old human, female, Ashley, and how so very far he had travelled from her. He set up an impressive pace, his hooves digging into the earth as he rutted with his mate. <br />
<br />
Sithathor braced herself as Ashley mounted her, his dense body pressing down and then the wonderful, full sensation of him entering her enormous vagina, designed not only to take his bull&#39;s penis, but also to birth an anthro calf. She huffed, blowing hot breath from her snout and when he began to breed her she let out a loud bovine groan, to join in with his bellow. She loved him, she knew that now, and she also loved mating with him, the sex every bit as fulfilling as she had dreamed of during her transition from human to Minotaur. Like many newly converted humans, she had needed to have sex almost immediately, and her clinic had provided a young bull within an hour of her waking up from the final body sculpting session to satisfy that need. That however, was a pale imitation of this and she felt herself sweating, her fur damp as Ashley became ever more forceful in his movements from behind. Their mating noises were certainly loud enough to deter any other Minotaur attending the gathering to intrude upon their privacy. Sithathor&#39;s genetically grown womb quaked with need, and with a final grunt, Ashley&#39;s blunted, dome-headed cock pushed into her cervix and he dumped his enormous load inside her, hot and thick and weighty inside her. He continued to hump against her as he ejaculated, until he struggled to remain inside her, his softening cock coated in his sperm and he eventually slipped from her, stringy discharge hanging from her vagina.<br />
<br />
They crashed to the ground almost together, nostrils flaring with exhaustion. Sithathor pressed her snout into Ashley&#39;s shoulder, knowing he had, in all probability impregnated her. He was her mate, and now, the Father of her calf. The happiness she felt was blissful as the stars began to come out above them.</p>
