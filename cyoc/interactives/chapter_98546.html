<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nearly three weeks later, Ty gathered with Mike, Christine, Joe, and Brian to tell them about his plan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I may finally have a way out of this mess, you guys,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I have found a weak spot in the wall surrounding the pasture. If we combine our strength, we should be able to break down the wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what then?,&quot; asked Christine. &quot;Even if we escape, we&#39;ll still be trapped in these forms. I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t think we would get far as cows. Who would milk us when our udders became to full? If we ran into any obstacles on the way, how would we fight them? We&#39;d end up being captured again, or worse, eaten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to remove the collars from around our necks. Once I remove my collar, I can use my magic to change us back,&quot; said Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do we remove the collars?,&quot; asked Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still working on that,&quot; replied Ty. <br />
<br />
Just then, the barn doors opened and the farmer entered. He approached the cows and placed a rope around Brian&#39;s neck and led him away. The others watched and wondered what would happen to Brian.<br />
Was he taken to be slaughtered? All they could do was wait and wonder.<br />
<br />
Nearly an hour later, the farmer returned with Brian and led him back inside the stall. Then he placed the rope around Joe&#39;s neck and led him away. The others looked at Brian curiously. He seemed different somehow. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Brian?,&quot; Christine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was amazing you guys,&quot; he said. And that was all he said.<br />
<br />
Another hour passed and the farmer returned with Joe and took away Christine. Joe had a look of happiness on his bovine face. &quot;We couldn&#39;t possibly leave this place. This farm is heaven.&quot; Both Joe and Brian walked over to one corner of the stall and started munching on some nearby hay. Ty was feeling a little concerned at this point. What was happening to his friends?<br />
<br />
A little while later, the farmer returned with Christine. She had the same look on her face as Brian and Joe, as if they were all in a trance. The farmer released her and placed the rope around Ty&#39;s neck and led him out of the barn.<br />
<br />
Ty followed the farmer to a fenced enclosure. In the center of the enclosure was a strange wooden device. The device had a ramp leading into it. Ty finally recognized it. It was some sort of holding pen. Even while knowing what it was, Ty was unable to resist the farmers commands and he followed the farmer into the device. Once he was inside, the farmer secured him in the device, leaving his rear exposed. Ty watched the farmer open a nearby gate and watched in horror as the intentions of the farmer were finally clear.<br />
<br />
A massive bull walked into the enclosure. Ty could smell the bull from where he stood. The scent of the bull was very powerful. He saw that the bulls long penis was exposed from its shaft. The bull knew what it was there to do, and so did Ty. The bull came around behind Ty, smelling his exposed flank. Ty wanted to resist with all his might, but the scent of the bull was too much to resist. Ty raised his tail and let out a stream of hot urine. The bull was not bothered by the urinating cow and immediately mounted Ty and drove his male member deep into Ty&#39;s bovine vagina. At first Ty was mortified by what was happening to him, but now the waves of pleasure he was feeling were so great, that he wished it would never end. He wasn&#39;t even disgusted when he began shitting himself during the sex. And neither was the bull, he continued plunging into Ty even as the bits of poop dripped down his crotch. Finally, with one last thrust, the bull injected his semen inside Ty. Soon afterwards, the bull removed his penis from Ty&#39;s smelly, shit-covered rear. And gazed upon the cow that was now bearing his seed. It was the greatest feeling Ty had ever experienced before in his life. A few moments later, the bull mounted Ty again. The bull injected Ty several times within the hour. <br />
<br />
Once the bull was led away, the farmer led Ty back to the barn and returned to the stall. Then the farmer exited the barn. The other cows approached Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you say you had a plan to get out of here, Ty,&quot; asked Christine.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at her and replied, &quot;What plan? Why would we ever want to leave? This place is great.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty seemed to forget his entire plan for the moment. Later that evening, the farmer returned to milk the cows. Each cow was incredibly cooperative with their milking, especially Ty. The routine was back to normal again.</p>
