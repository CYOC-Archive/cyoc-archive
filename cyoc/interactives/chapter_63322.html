<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim held his breath and ascended high above the clouds, rapidly passing each layer of the Earth's atmosphere <br />
until he was floating right next to the International Space Station. The crew inside waved at Tim, seeing him <br />
as Supergirl, hero. <br />
<br />
He/She waved back sheepishly. <br />
<br />
As much as Tim loved living among the citizens of the DC Universe, several things concerned him. For one <br />
thing, did being Kara Zor-El, a fictional character, mean that now he himself was a fictional character? Was <br />
someone reading about or writing his experiences right now? If Superboy-Prime could originally come from &quot;the <br />
real world&quot;, why couldn't Tim? This in itself also brought up several slightly disturbing questions about the <br />
nature of reality, such as where fiction ended and reality began. Tim began to wonder if this was just all an <br />
illusion. But Tim figured that he couldn't second-guess himself right now, and just worked with what he had. <br />
Which version of Earth was he looking at? Tim assumed that it was the Earth formed after the Crisis On <br />
Infinite Earths event in 1980's, but it could easily be in any of the canonical 52 alternate universes <br />
comprising DC. Or hell, maybe this was even an &quot;Elseworld&quot;. Tim shuddered when he remembered that DC was <br />
rebooting it's entire line of comics this September, effectively eliminating this entire continuity(if this <br />
was in fact New Earth) from existence.<br />
<br />
Also, Tim wondered exactly who it was that noticed that his gaffe when he didn't immediately fly away after <br />
the Granny Goodness incident. Was it Batman? Tim freaked out at that notion. If there was any superhero that <br />
was capable of figuring out his true identity and neutralizing his powers, it was him. Well, The Question <br />
could probably figure out Tim's real identity too, but he/she(depending on if it's Vic Sage or Renee Montoya) <br />
didn't have close to the goldmine of resources that Batman had to study Tim. Speaking of Batman, what about <br />
the other legions of powerful beings that could kill/torture/brainwash/vaporize Tim? He realized right away <br />
that he was way over his head, and didn't have the dedication, patience or will to tough it out as a full time <br />
hero even if he really wanted to be one. Even though he was trapped in the little sexpot body of the Princess <br />
Of Power, he would still rather sit at home and play video games or read a book. &quot;Or maybe it's the first day <br />
jitters talking, and I really am meant for this&quot;, said Tim out loud. Without air. How? He sighed wistfully, <br />
wondering if Paul knew where he was. Probably not, the screw up. Why didn't he wait until he translated the <br />
whole book before spellcasting?<br />
<br />
Tim then flew to Mars, lost in thought. Sardonically, Tim realized that he was playing out the exact same <br />
scene from &quot;Watchmen&quot; where Doctor Manhattan goes to Mars. Did the comic book Watchmen even exist in this <br />
reality? Taking a nice red rock to sit down upon, the new Supergirl brooded even more. While it took him quite <br />
a few minutes to get over the wow factor of flying from the Earth to Mars in less time that it took real world <br />
Tim to run a fifty foot sprint, eventually his mind wandered to thinking about who could help him in getting <br />
back to his reality. He recalled that Zatanna Zatara lived in Gotham City, he just didn't know exactly where. <br />
Ditto for Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern. Tim was never too much into Doctor Fate and didn't know <br />
about his behavior or secret base, so he was out of the running. Maybe Jason Blood? Tim scratched him off the <br />
list that was writing itself insidr his(or her) head, noting that Jason was too unstable what with Etrigan <br />
inside him. Not knowing what to do, Tim decided to pay the Watchtower a visit.<br />
<br />
Flying was the one good, no, really great thing about this adventure so far. <br />
<br />
The Watchtower was the Justice League's official base, located on the moon. It had everything a superhero or a <br />
nerd could want; cool gadgets, nifty magical trinkets, the ability to spy on the entire world while they were <br />
none the wiser. Tim, or Kara as he was now known, got clearance to come inside from J'onn J'onzz, the Martian <br />
Manhunter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Kara. Could you give some detail into your battle with the Apokoliptian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I remember flying to the ground and punching her into the dirt,creating a crater around six feet deep. <br />
Other than that it's pretty hazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm happy to inform that it wasn't the real Granny Goodness. It was an android sent to Earth <br />
specifically to battle you and presumably to monitor your reactions and fighting patterns. Do you have any <br />
idea why this could be? Why Darkseid or his servants would target you out of all of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim was a little spooked now. &quot;I-I have no idea, J'onn. I can't remember anything before I attacked Granny <br />
Goodness. I mean the fake Granny Goodness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm&quot; replied the alien. &quot;Would you be up to a mind probing to see what happened to you?&quot;. J'onn stared at the <br />
blonde Kryptonian girl with an expressionless face. Tim knew that that look was actually a sign of compassion. <br />
Although the Martian was known at certain times for bouts of ruthlessness that was needed in battle, Tim could <br />
read the subtle twitching in his face.</p>
