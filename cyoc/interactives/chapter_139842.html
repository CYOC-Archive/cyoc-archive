<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is a nightmare,&quot; Jeffery thought crossly after having quickly fled from the coach&#39;s office. Not having paid attention to where he was going, he eventually stopped and leaning against a wall, he gazed up at the ceiling and muttered, &quot;A damn nightmare,&quot; and hating how much his voice reminded him of what had happened, Jeffery squeezed his eyes shut, questioning how he could have been so stupid.<br />
<br />
A sensation of dread at the prospect of facing the next four years - and the rest of his life - trapped in an alternate lifestyle he had no understanding of creeping over him, Jeffery slowly opened his eyes and pushed away from the wall. His backpack causing his balance to shift, bumped against his ass (&quot;boipussy&quot; a voice quickly corrected in his mind), and remind him that he was wearing no underwear, he toyed with the idea of somehow stealing the transmitter back. But, remembering the sound of a key turning in a lock as Coach Gillian locked the desk drawer, Jeff despaired even more. Hugging himself, feeling the soft of fabric of his colorful (&quot;fabulous&quot;) shirt against his skin, he thought to himself and feeling his man-bun shift on the back of his head, he thought, &quot;I don&#39;t feel different, maybe I&#39;m not gay, maybe I can resist it.&quot;  But then an image popped into his head of Kyle - the captain of the football team - and as he immediately got hard at the thought of Kyle&#39;s dreamy smile and hot hard muscles... Jeffery dropped his arms back down to his sides and began to weep. Kyle was so beautiful, how could he live without his boyfriend?<br />
<br />
Blindly starting to once more make his way through the school, his mind leaping from one idea to the next, Jeffery disregarded them as quickly as he thought of them. Settling on the computer programme, he wondered if there was a way to use it without the remote. Wiping the tears from his face, feeling ashamed not just at what had happened but also that he broken down into what he perceived to be an emotional wreck (is this part of the new gay me? In touch with my feelings??), he sniffed. Looking about, trying to determine where he was, he told himself, &quot;Get a hold of yourself, girlfriend&quot; and thinking of excuses to tell anyone he might run into as to why he was blubbering, he headed in the direction of the nearest exit.<br />
<br />
Outside, he paused in the late July heat and took several calming breaths. Starting to feel a bit better, Jeffery hoped he could undo everything as he adjusted his pack so it was sitting more comfortably, slipping his man purse inside. Stylish shoes clicking against the sidewalk, he took one last glance at the school, tried to come up with a way to get back the transmitter and, drawing a blank, began to walk back home.<br />
<br />
Unsure what he would say to aunt Carol, certain she&#39;d want to hear all about how he&#39;d made the squad, Jeffery took his time. Trying to sort his thoughts, finding he was dwelling mostly on what he&#39;d do with the Chronivac programme if he could use it without the remote, he breathed a sigh of relief when he reached home and saw that his aunt&#39;s car wasn&#39;t in the driveway or parked under the attached carport. Letting himself in the side door, he stood for a moment in the kitchen, listening to the silent house, confirming he was indeed the house was empty except for him. Hearing nothing, he checked the fridge, where his mom usually left notes, and discovering a note from aunt Carol, he read, &quot;Had to run a couple errands. I&#39;ll be back around supper time. Want to hear all about tryouts, which I believe you passed with no problems. Hugs and kisses. Aunt Carol.&quot; Recycling the note, Jeff sat down at the table and sitting like he would normally, legs spread, he leaned forward and pulled off the expensive and fabulous shoes.<br />
<br />
Relief expressed in a sigh, Jeffery sat for a moment, wiggling his toes and every so often rubbing his feet. Staring down at his lap, he realized his legs were crossed in a very feminine way, and eventually adjusted the way he was sitting. Trying to remember and emulate the way he used to sit - the way straight guys sit, but it simply didn&#39;t come naturally now, Jeffery noticed how limp his wrist was and groaned when he noted how easy it was for him to sit like a gay man - his body language screamed &quot;gay&quot; now. Standing suddenly, he scooped up the shoes off the floor and, holding them by one finger, he collected backpack from where he&#39;d dropped it on the table and headed for his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Tempted to tear off and tear up the (fabulous) clothes he was wearing, Jeffery resisted it as he strolled across his room like a model on a catwalk. Ignoring the flowery decorating and posters of (hot) guys all over his room - ignoring pretty much everything about it that showed the truth of his situation, he dropped his backpack to the desk, sat down in front of the computer and booted it up. Waiting as it turned on, he absently tapped his well-manicured finger nails on the desk, feeling restless and hoping that, even though he&#39;d lost the remote, he still could undo what had happened. When he&#39;d finally logged in and the desktop appeared, he clicked on the Chronivac icon and pulled up the programme. Searching it, desperate for any hint of an end to what had happened, he eventually groaned and sat back. Staring at the screen, he idly begin clicking, still looking, but knowing that, without the transmitter, there was no way he could turn himself back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be gay,&quot; he suddenly wailed in a high voice (even as a voice inside of him said, &quot;But you&#39;re so fine and you know it girlfriend - and so does Kyle!&quot;) and feeling like he was going to start crying again, he screamed at the programme, &quot;I cannot be a gay. I don&#39;t how to be gay. OMG, it&#39;s so not fair,&quot; and still clicking on stuff, he eventually learned that there was an expected growth function that was set to default.<br />
<br />
Unsure what that meant, he clicked on it and learned that, as Jeffery, his growth would be normal and that by the time Jeffery was done growing, he&#39;d be what was considered average for a twink - neat, slim, fine blonde hair, a hundred and twenty-three pounds, 5-inch cock (cuz a big one would be wasted on a hot ass like you girlfriend!) and a size s/m figure. Backing out of it, Jeffery clicked on a couple more things, still searching for what he tried to assure himself was there and was elusive. Discovering that his sexual preference was normal for a gay guy, Jeffery searched a bit longer, learning that, as Jeffery, his reality was that his father had left shortly after he&#39;d been born, his dad had died when he was about five, his mom had died in childbirth and that he was raised by her aunt, who was a successful business owner.<br />
<br />
Eventually closing the programme, fully coming to the realisation that without the remote, he was stuck as Jeffery, he crossed his arms across his chest, sniffed and stood up. Staring at his room, he drifted over to his bed and lay down, it felt so soft and inviting with all the pillows. Reaching for one of the stuffed animals, he hugged the cute unicorn with rainbow mane and tail close, and feeling himself starting to cry, he whispered, &quot;I cannot do this.&quot; He just wanted to bury his face in Kyle&#39;s big, strong chest, the idea of being in his boyfriend&#39;s muscular arms so comforting and making him feel so safe... then realizing what he was thinking, he cried harder.<br />
<br />
After a bit, he rolled over and stood. Looking over at the full-body mirror, he tossed the plush back on the bed and walked over to the mirror. Peering into the reflective surface, staring at himself, he took in as much detail about his new appearance as he could. Reaching for the buttons on the front of the shirt, he undid them, opened his shirt and let it slip off him and puddled to the floor, pants following suit. Peering at his naked body, studying his slim swimmer&#39;s build and smaller groin, of which he knew no hair would grow, a left over that hadn&#39;t been changed when he&#39;d used the Chronivac to remove all his body hair when he&#39;d still been straight, Jeff gingerly touched the two piercings through his nipples. Shivering, liking that gentle caressing feeling, hating himself for liking it as he imagined a tingling deep in his boipussy and felt his cock starting to precum (it didn&#39;t even get hard), he toyed with the idea of playing with himself while thinking of Kyle and instead quickly turned away from the mirror and headed for the bureau.<br />
<br />
A quick search revealed all the clothes within and holding up one of pairs of the underwear he was expected to wear as a gay boi, he asked, &quot;How can anhyone wear stuff like this?&quot; as every single pair was either the same type, a thong, or what he thought was an odd shirt that came down, covered his butt and groin, and had snaps on a part that would end up between his legs.<br />
<br />
He put on a banana hammock. Adjusting it, trying to get used to how it barely covered his front, pressed into his (cute little) cocklet, he eventually reached for a pink dildo. Inserting the dildo into his boipussy, he didn&#39;t even seem to realize what he was doing - it felt so right and natural, not to mention satisfying. Failing to come up with a reason, he searched the next draw and found a pink tank top that said &quot;GAY AND PROUD&quot; that had thin shoulder straps and, after pulling it on, discovered that it left his midriff bare. Searching the third drawer, he eventually settled on a pair of fine red low-rise designer jeans that were to die for, instead of zipper and buttons rather had a cord on front that formed an small X when tied. Pulling on the pants, he at first thought they were too small, but once he had the skin-tight jeans on, he realized they made his ass look super sexy.<br />
<br />
Dressed, thinking he looked all right, he stared down at the pants, and found himself loving how tight they were and how they clearly showed and emphasised his hot bubble butt.  This isn&#39;t so bad, Jeffery thought, the clothes are super cute and I look fierce!  He headed back to his computer. Clicking on the internet, he pulled up a search engine and, without even thinking, started searching for a sexy cock ring he could give to his boyfriend to put on that monster cock of his (oh God I want to suck it now!), figuring as he clicked on a couple websites that he could figure out how to fix things later, right now he wanted to get a gift for his and Kyle&#39;s year anniversary of going steady together.</p>
