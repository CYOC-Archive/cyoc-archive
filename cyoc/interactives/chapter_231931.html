<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I messed up thinking April was human in previous chapter options. Hopefully this chapter corrects that.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Somehow food tastes better, when being shared with good company,” Fred smiling as he gladly accepts the berries May was feeding him. The red haired centauress with a reddish fur for her horsey half was the reincarnated girlfriend that Fred lost long ago. Loosing May to a horse thanks to a freak accident gave him a fear of horses; it made him leave town as May’s family were influential and were trying to have him charged.<br />
“I’m glad you are more at ease,” May answers as she sat behind Fred; allowing him to rest and relax as he leans back and lies on her belly. She smiles sweetly at the blacksmith; “Who do you think will change along with you?”<br />
“As it’s always a human and horse changing together,” Fred commenting as he gently strokes one of May’s forelegs; so it could be April, the horse I rode on. Or Aiko’s steed Helios or Zoey’s steed,” Fred trailing off as he watches several centaurs play host to the children. He notices Ben passing out water and spots something odd.<br />
“Ben’s glasses are missing,” Fred commenting as he accepts the venison; sensing May is also eating as he feels her muscles clench in her lower abdomen as she swallows. Feeling her chest heave as her lower lungs fill and deflate with air as he slowly watched the sky darken and the moons rise.<br />
“In fact,” Fred mulling as he grabs the nearby glass of water to drink; “I don’t recall him wearing them while he got shooed.”<br />
“Perhaps he doesn’t need them anymore,” May putting the plate down to embrace Fred; letting her hands relax around his belly; “perhaps Epona’s magic is fixing all the faults in us.”<br />
<br />
Fred was about to answer when a scream was let loose; causing him to get up just as Chris stood up and was already by the distressed person’s side.<br />
“It has begun,” Chris calmly speaking as he noticed it was Aiko’s cries. Also observing that Chris was using his bulk to help shield Aiko from the prying eyes of children; giving her a bit of modesty as her genitals grow and shift to fit her new equine proportions.<br />
“And it looks like Helios as well,” May commenting; Fred’s gaze is soon turned to see the tanned fur mustang groan and collapse as a human torso rapidly grows from where the horse’s neck should be.<br />
“Akio is a shire centaur mare,” May talking softly; “Helios bronze skin makes him look like a man from the Mediterranean. Crete I think?”<br />
<br />
“Guess I’ll be next.” Fred leaning off of May; Sitting up he looks at his shoes and shucks them off. Following that, Fred takes off his socks and undoes the button and fly on his pants.<br />
“Can you pull my pants off when I start,” Fred turning his head to look at May; “I think we can salvage the material for other uses.”<br />
“Of course,” May answering; nodding as she guides him back to resting on her belly; “and when you become a centaur…”<br />
“You want to engage in some horse play,” Fred smiling; “if that’s the case pass me the plate so I can stuff myself silly.”<br />
<br />
 *********<br />
<br />
Taking his first plate from the buffet, Jackson piled on the food as if he was starving. In truth he hadn’t eaten anything since breakfast. Not realizing that the days are longer on this world; lasting roughly thirty hours, Jackson hadn’t eaten in roughly fourteen hours. He ripped into the cooked venison like a savage; stuffing meat into his face as fast as he puts it his plate; he soon walks down the table, piling on carrots, potatoes, a cob of corn and several fruits. He walks to an empty spot by one of the tables; sitting next to one of the horses that his scout troop and the separate girl scout troop rode in on.<br />
“Wow,” a voice speaking next to Jackson; “you must be so hungry, you’re trying to eat a horse.”<br />
 “No,” Jackson sighing as he knows it the horse next to him speaking; “but I will become part horse.”<br />
“Smells like mare,” The horse nickering; “you are the one Epona is mad at.”<br />
“SO you all know as well,” Jackson groaning as he is coldly reminded of the fate awaits him.”<br />
“She spoke to us in our minds,” The horse chuckling; “because of you, only two of us will become mares to balance us out.”<br />
<br />
Sixteen horses along with sixteen riders. Four adults, two males, two females and twelve children. Eleven stallions and five mares.<br />
“The children are safe from getting gender swapped,” the horse shaking his head; “but they will become foals shortly after they fall asleep.”<br />
“In the meantime,” Jackson watching Chris and Amanda; two centaurs who effortlessly disarmed him and tied him up; “the children get dinner and a show.”<br />
“And adopted,” the horse adding; “they will need parents to help them as they grow into yearlings and soon breeding stock. Sorry,” the horse speaking; “sentience is new and confusing, I am still thinking like a horse.”<br />
“It seems those thoughts are prevalent in centaurs,” Jackson waving away the apology; slowing down his food intake as he starts to feel full from his gorging. ‘Thoughts I’m afraid to have,’ Jackson still dreading when he begins to change.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Jenny,” April whinnied as she collapsed onto her side; “I think I’m next!”<br />
“Me as well,” Fred gasping; doing his best to stay relaxed as May quickly stood up and helps pull off his pants. She tries to reach for his briefs before they burst but it was too late. She angles herself to keep his rapidly growing manhood hidden behind her equine half. This naturally got a few groans from where the children were eating and watching. May turns her head to look down on Fred as his legs quickly morph and change into his new hind legs. Feet twisting and stretching as the big toes soon turns into hoofs. His other toes slowly vanishing as his feet and ankles shoot up. As his equine torso fills and barrels out, his forelegs soon grow in.<br />
<br />
May gasps as his fur grows in. Not a single solitary shade like her fur and others; Fred’s fur was dual toned. On his mostly creamy white furred equine half was a large dark brown splotch; two in fact. One that grew on his underside, covering his mottled equine phallus in a furry sheath and creeping up along his flanks. The other large splotch of brown fur was where his equine torso met his human half, ending halfway down his new fore legs. The mane that grew on his spine slowly went from the dark shade of hair on his head to a snow white shade at the bottom of his human back. His tail forms and cascades into the same shade of fur as his mane near the center of his back hiding his massive furry balls that May resists the urge to give a playful squeeze.<br />
“A paint horse,” Fred instinctively knowing as the transformation finishes; “that was intense.”<br />
“Rest up,” May doing her best to sit next to Fred as he passes out; May looking up to see Jenny already comforting April and offering her a top to hide her new womanly breasts. “That leaves Zoey and Jenny the last humans left for our group. And two horses to join them.”<br />
“Then is our turn,” Steve who was sitting next to Fred and May while enjoying company with the mare he rode; a horse named Starlight. “And I know,” Steve speaking as May nods and grin; “you are all here to help us and we shouldn’t be scared.”</p>
