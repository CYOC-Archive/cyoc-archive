<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had certainly been a rough couple of days for Starlight. Attending human high school, appearing younger than her little sister Spark, braces. None of it helped the fairy and her growing anxiety. She hoped a return to the realm of the Fae would help but it only made her more anxious as she gazed into a mirror in her older sisters potion shop. Despite returning to fairy form and appearing as her adult self once more, she couldn&#39;t shake a nagging feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Midna do I look younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Midan replied, the purple fairy busily pulling out chemicals as she looked to restock her shelves. &quot;You look the same to me. If anything you look older, the bags under your eyes look darker and I&#39;m pretty sure I saw some crows feet earlier. You might want to rethink your beauty routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Star frowned, leaning closer to the mirror to inspect herself more closely. There were no bags under her eyes, per usual Midna was lost in thought. That was the problem with her older sister, Midna may have been a gentle and kind soul but she was kind of a ditz. For Star it was both endearing and frustrating. Midna was always honest and willing to listen but she had the attention span of a nat. More times than she cared to remember, Midna would seemingly forget what they were talking about. Instead offering a kind smile or helpful advise. It made staying mad at her sister impossible as well as making sure no one would hurt her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww what&#39;s the matter Starry? You breaking out in zits?&quot;<br />
<br />
Star turned, startled by the voice, only to shockingly see Spark smiling at her. &quot;What are you doing here Spark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thats right&quot; Midna said suddenly. &quot;Spark came by a little before you showed up. She said not to say anything about it though, she wanted to surprise you. I guess I forgot.&quot; Midna now shrugged her shoulders, going back to her potion making.  Star sighed grumbled as she glared at the teenage fairy. &quot;What are you doing here Spark,&quot; she said. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be in class or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Half day due to conferences,&quot; Spark grinned. &quot;And I figured after your little run in with Deacon you&#39;d show up here. Talk with Midna about what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on,&quot; Midna asked, not looking up from her work. &quot;Oh Starry didn&#39;t tell you,&quot; Spark exclaimed in jubilation. &quot;She&#39;s got a crush on a human.&quot; Midna paused in her work, now gleefully looking at her sister. &quot;Oh that&#39;s wonderful,&quot; Midna said happily. &quot;Hey did you know Spark has a human boyfriend? He&#39;s really nice too. Are you trying to copy Spark again out of jealousy Star?&quot; <br />
<br />
Star growled, Spark desperately trying to muffle her laughter as she gazed at the ornage fairy. It seemed Midna had inadvertently told a secret Star had shared in confidence. It wasn&#39;t like the two sisters didn&#39;t know that though, their was some jealousy on both sides. Star always jealous of Spark adventuring in the human world with a demon hunting family, while Spark was jealous of how successful Star had become within thw fairy world. &quot;No,&quot; Star exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m not jealous. Besides, who knows if Deacon is even that interested in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh quit leaving out the best part,&quot; Spark groaned. &quot;What&#39;s the best part,&quot; Midna asked, the purple fairy now seemingly invested in all of this. &quot;The human Star likes is younger than me,&quot; Spark laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you hadn&#39;t noticed I&#39;m still an adult Sparky,&quot; Star countered, the orange fairy standing tall and looking down on her now teenage fairy sister. &quot;Unlike you little sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah for now&quot; Spark smirked. &quot;But once you dance with Deacon and perform the Rite of Spring all that changes. Starry is just going to start getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller.&quot; Star was seething, especially as Spark now held out her hand to measure Stars height. With each mention of smaller, Spark made it a point to lower the measurement of her height to such a ridiculous degree that she held her hand at waist level. Even if she did dance with Deacon she wouldn&#39;t end up that small. Spark was just poking her, trying to get a rise out of her sister at her predicament....and it worked.<br />
<br />
With a yell Star now lunged, grabbing a hold of the green fairies hair, the two engaged in a sisterly cat fight as they began to wrestle. Screams and curses now leaving their lips as the pair tumbled across the shop. &quot;Okay stop you two,&quot; Midna said nervously. The purple fairy was never one for violence and always hated when her sisters fought. At this point though the two were beyond words. Scratching, pulling hair, and tumbling across the floor of Midna&#39;s shop they never noticed the display case. Crashing through it and destroying the display completely. Midna now furrowed her brow, her purple cheeks darkening in anger as she glared at her younger sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now I&#39;m going to kick some ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly walking to the pair, Midna now reached down, grasping Star and Spark by the ear. With a simple twist, the two sisters now immediately stopped fighting, their anger abating as Midna twisted an ear. All each of them could utter was a single word. Ow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you two listen,&quot; Midna stated, her voice tense yet soft. No matter how hard she tried, her voice never could sound angry or even authoritative. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you two are always like this? You either are best friends or fight like rabid pixies!&quot; Star and Spark said nothing, the pair wincing in pain from Midnas simple yet effective ear twist. &quot;Star,&quot; she said. &quot;When Spark fell in love with a human you kept poking fun at her about it too. And Spark, obviously Star is freaked out and while I get that you want to tease her you need throttle back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She started it,&quot; Star whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t you did,&quot; Spark countered.<br />
<br />
Midna frowned, twisting her sisters ears a but until they both stopped arguing again. &quot;Ow that hurts,&quot; Spark whined. &quot;Um I know that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it,&quot; Midna stated. &quot;Now I&#39;m not letting you two go until you work this out.&quot; Star and Spark groaned, trying to look past Midna as they spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay look I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;I know all too well what&#39;s its like falling for a human, especially a teenage one. Yeah it was scary growing younger and looking like a teenager but I wouldn&#39;t change any of it. If you really like Deacon I say go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Star winced. &quot;And I&#39;m sorry about giving you so much shit. I guess I got a bit jealous that you performed the Rite of Spring before I did. Yeah the whole ageing thing is freaking me out and I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going to happen with Deacon. But I&#39;m happy that you gave me your blessing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See better,&quot; Midna smiled before giggling. &quot;You know if we were in jail right now, you two would be like my bitches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark and Star raised an eyebrow, glancing up at the goofy grin on their big sisters face. &quot;Okay my bitches,&quot; Midna stated, the goofy smile still plastered on her face. &quot;Sounds like things are good for now, so why don&#39;t you clean up thw mess you made in my shop then plan a date night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Releasing her sisters, Midna now strolled back around the counter, continuing with her potion making as Star and Spark now cleaned. As they did, then talked softly about plans for a double date, as well as how to avoid having their big sister snatch them by the ear again.</p>
