<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Sally woke up and went down stairs. There was a package waiting for her she opened it to find it was the bras she had ordered yesterday. There were two regular bras, both white with a lot of support. There was a maternity bra as well which she quickly put on it was white with clips on the front to expose her breasts. And lastly there was a push-up bra, it was black lace with a red trim. She wondered why she had bought it as her breasts were already huge.<br />
Suddenly Sally heard Sam start to cry she ran up stairs and scooped him up, she checked his diaper to find it was messy so she gave him a change and dressed him. She gave Sam a small t-shirt with a plain on it and a pair of jeans small enough to fit him. When She was finished she realised that Sam was hungry and so she produced one of her breasts through her maternity bra and fed him. When she was finished she got changed herself she put on one of her new t-shirts, a pair of blue leggings and a pair of short shorts over the top. The shorts could barely contain her wide hips and ass but were tight enough as to make her look sexy.<br />
Sally was prepared to meet her niece. She had never met her before so she couldn&#39;t see why she was worried last night.<br />
<br />
About two hours later there was a knock at the door Sally opened it and saw a girl who appeared to be about seventeen stood there. She had red hair and quite a plain face. She was also quite curvy with breasts that were at least a 32DD and she had the ass to match.<br />
&quot;Hello, are you miss Sally Jensen?&quot; she asked cheerfully.<br />
&quot;Um, yes. Are you Kimberly?&quot; She replied<br />
&quot;I prefer Ki.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well then Ki do come in.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Sally and Ki went through to the kitchen where Sam was and began talking. Sally learned that Ki&#39;s parents had divorced when her mother was pregnant with her. And that her mother died in childbirth, so Ki had spent all of her life in foster homes. Sally&#39;s brother had been Ki&#39;s father but they were never very close and Sally only learned a week ago that Ki existed. Ki asked if she could stay for a few days before she started college on Monday. Sally obviously agreed glad to have someone to talk to. She introduced Ki to Sam telling her all about him, obviously it was all lies but Ki believed it all.<br />
<br />
Whilst talking to Ki, Sally learned that she was quite the nerd. She had never had many friends and would absorb herself in her studies. Ki was going to Stanford university to study film making and cinematography. Sally was willing to help Ki as much as possible and told her she could help her make friends at college. Ki agreed curious as what was going to happen.<br />
Sally told Ki to wait in the guest bedroom as she laid down Sam for his nap.<br />
When Sally returned she had a collection of creams ready for Ki to try. Ki picked one at random and Sally went to get some gloves. When Sally returned she told Ki to strip her clothes off, Ki was nervous but obliged standing there naked Sally applied a small amount of cream to her breasts and ass. She then switched creams and applied the cream only to her face.<br />
<br />
Ki fell asleep and was completely knocked out for the next twelve hours when she woke it was eight a.m. and she felt different somewhat heavier. She went into the bathroom and stared at her face it was recognisably her but she looked different. All the blemishes she had were gone. Her lips were fuller, her nose was smaller and her eyes looked bigger. She looked like Sally only with green eyes instead of Sally&#39;s brown. She then noticed her breasts. They were larger then they were before about as big as Sally&#39;s were. The few noticeable things that was different between the two of them were each others eyes and hair. Also unbeknownst to Ki her ass was much bigger. She looked at her clothes to find they were fit to bursting. So she went into Sally&#39;s room and put some of hers on she put on one of Sally&#39;s bras to find it fit perfectly. So she tried some of her other clothes. They also fitted her fine. In the end Ki was wearing the exact same outfit Sally had on yesterday: a beige dress with a belt underneath her breasts and a black pair of leggings. Ki now felt more confident than she ever had but realised she needed new clothes, so she went downstairs to find Sally feeding Sam in a rocking chair in the living room.<br />
&quot;Um aunt Sally, what did you put on me last night?&quot; She asked nervously.<br />
&quot;Oh, just some beauty cream honey. Why, is there a problem?&quot; Sally replied.<br />
&quot;Oh no it&#39;s just that none of my clothes fit any more.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, well we can go shopping today get you some new clothes for college until then, just let me help you with you dress.&quot; Sally laid Sam down on the chair and walked over to Ki. She undid the top three buttons of her dress exposing a good amount if cleavage and moved her bra up a bit to expose even more. She then told her to put her shoes on so they could go out. Ki put on her blue converse and was ready to go out the door when Sally told her to change her shoes as they didn&#39;t go with her outfit at all. <br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have any other shoes&quot; Ki replied.<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ll buy you some then.&quot;<br />
The babysitter arrived to take care of Sam until they returned Sally told her to feed him some of the milk in the fridge and if she ran out to call her. And then Sally and Ki got in the car and drove to the mall.</p>
