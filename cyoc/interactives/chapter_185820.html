<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been well over two weeks since that night with Abernathy and yet, Selicia&#39;s power came back in a steady trickle. For the first week she had assumed that it was a lack of ambient power to draw on. A few simple tests had shown that this was not the case as her once mentor was recovering quite steadily. Along the same vein of thought, any attempt to chase answers out of the imprisoned Abernathy were met with derisive laughter at the state of Selicia&#39;s own appearance. In lieu of a full recovery, Selicia had made the effort to alter her appearance enough that she didn&#39;t have to be concerned about her panties digging into her thighs as she went about her day.<br />
<br />
Standing at a solid three and a half feet tall with wide hips and barely any chest to speak of, Selicia was still quite irritable overall. Her consultation work had been postponed indefinitely as even being seen to interview potential staff had proven a grueling experience from the variety of responses her appearance had received. From disgustingly lewd stares to barely concealed snickers and worst of all the ill conceived coos of some of the more matronly. She sufficed to seeing only three candidates at most in a day after a particularly trying session of interviews led to the employment of a overeager male candidate... He was doing a fine job cleaning the feet of further candidates arriving since... as a finely bristled doormat just inside the door... Pest...<br />
<br />
A number of the other candidates, man and woman alike, had been unnerved by the trinkets and prizes within the consultation room. With the uncanny likeness to real people and the pillow&#39;s eyes seeming to plead with them as they spoke. Selcicia couldn&#39;t blame them for the feelings they had, she knew after all, that they were right to feel so. Laticia had only been adjusted from time to time for the sake of comfort but, she remained facing outward from the chair since her own transformation over a week ago. Pulling herself into the chair and nestling into Laticia, Selicia regarded the pillow woman with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s ok, Dear~ You&#39;re doing a fantastic job of easing my concerns.&quot; She ran her right hand along Laticia&#39;s frilly slit and laughed as her eyes rolled. &quot;I think I might keep you just like this, you&#39;re so responsive that it almost feels like you&#39;re real~&quot; Selicia laughed as Laticia&#39;s eyes returned a look of deepseated worry.<br />
<br />
Her first appointment for the day was an older woman of rather plain features. Straight brown hair falling on angular shoulder while framing equally brown eyes. Her overall figure seemed to fit perfectly in a box with an astounding lack of curves. It didn&#39;t help her case that even her personality seemed as cut and dry as her appearance would suggest. Ordinarily, Selicia might&#39;ve spiced up the meeting with the woman by adjusting her body to be more... Appetizing in nature but, she still had to control her impulses for the lack of power she could apply to them. So it was with a miserable yawn that she conspicuously groped Laticia&#39;s left breast causing the pillows eyes to widen in response. The woman&#39;s own eyes nearly bulged from their sockets seeing the act and response in kind that led to her dismissing herself early. Selicia leaned her head over her shoulder eyeing Laticia and sneered as she pinched the soft plush nipple. &quot;Good girl~&quot;<br />
<br />
Her next appointment was a younger woman that had obviously groomed herself shortly before the meeting. Her deep black hair sticking out with stray strands and slightly disheveled. Her slight frame supported a modest bust and hips while her face carried her more distinct features. The girl&#39;s family must&#39;ve hailed from the orient with the slant of her hazel eyes being just so. There were signs of exhaustion prickling those eyes that Selicia picked up on with ease alongside the stiffness of her shoulders. However looking just a bit deeper showed Selicia so much more, a rarity of sorts being this girl was sitting on a stockpile of the power Selicia was so starved of... Clearing her throat after having stared for so long, Selicia marched dutifully through the same questions and statements she&#39;d had done so often as late. All the while she sought out signs of the girl consciously or subconsciously using even a shred of that wellspring. Her confused expression being the only hint that she might&#39;ve felt Selicia&#39;s exploration as none but, the natural amount escaped her body.<br />
<br />
Getting further along into the interview, Selicia noted that like all the other&#39;s her eyes tended to wander across her collection. They lingered on a few objects like Lily and her friends, the wiccan girl and her pet, and the mother/daughter pair that poor Laticia made the unfortunate decision to separate. Selicia gave said unfortunate a pat on her soft head drawing the young woman&#39;s eyes to meet Laticia&#39;s. Again the pillow silently pleaded for help but, this time was rewarded with a blank stare before those eyes fell on Selicia once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite the uh... Quite the collection you have there, Miss...&quot; There wasn&#39;t a hint of unease in her voice, just a sort of bored interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s a little eccentric but, I do so enjoy the novelty of them all. Occasionally, I get some items that don&#39;t quite pique my interest as much... However, most of the items displayed in here are my pride and joy.&quot; Selicia settled into a cool smile as she stroked Laticia&#39;s side causing the pillows eyes to settle. &quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t bother you too much~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah... I mean, I don&#39;t mind at all. Everyone has their inerests after all.&quot; The slip seemed to concern the young woman where the collection did not. She adjusted her posture in her seat as she sought to recollect herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic~ Working here would be something out of the ordinary as you could imagine.&quot; The young woman nodded a response. Assuring herself, Selicia had settled on a plan to steal the font from the woman. A potentially dangerous plan but, the needs outweighed the risks for certain... As she rose from her seat the young woman hastily did the same waiting for Selcicia to approach her. She followed with a gesture and as Selicia set her out the front door personally, she gave the woman a firm pat of her ass. &quot;Oh... Sorry, I sometimes forget my perdicament of height, please forgive me~&quot; A mark in the shape of a stylized heart grew into shape as the young woman brushed off the gesture. &quot;Oh, how rude of me, Dear... What did you say your name was again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Min.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selicia closed the door behind Min after promising to contact her sometime soon. With a deep breath, she called out for Marina, who arrived shortly after with practiced grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistress?&quot; Marina smiled brightly upon delivery of the words, she&#39;d been busy training a number of replacements.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be in my room for an extended period, you&#39;ll be in charge in the meantime. Should you need anything from me, knock three times and again twice more. Waiting for the affirmative from Marina, Selicia left for her room and locked it tightly including wards painstakingly added since the intrusion. She couldn&#39;t risk that sort of mistake while she did this... Laying herself out on the bed, she used a margin of her power to watch time slow as she slipped from her own body. Satisfied that her physical self would be preserved while she was gone, she darted toward that beacon leaving down the street. Min was about to have the time of her life and she wasn&#39;t even aware of it.<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Min&#39;s perspective:<br />
<br />
As Min left the manor and made it a few blocks down, she was accosted by a strong wind that sent a chill down her spine. With a shiver that caused her to straighten her posture momentarily, she took a deep breath and pressed on. The small woman in the manor had one hell of a hobby... No wonder, the posting had been up for weeks... I doubt a lot of people would be ok with that sort of shit... Except the weirdos or the desperate... Min thought to herself with a decline into self defeat. &quot;Like me...&quot; She spoke out loud as she considered what led her to the interview in the first place.<br />
<br />
Her parents had always wanted her to do the best she could and be just like her older sister, Ari... Ah yes, the ever perfect Ari, who does all, knows all, and shits rainbows... Not wanting to head home just yet she hung left at the next corner putting her back to the sun. Maybe that will work out that cold spot left by the wind. She let out a soft yawn and worked her shoulder as she muttered. Had the meeting really been that long? It was only about an hour... Whatever... Early night means less time with the family... At the same time though, a different part of her felt more invigorated. Fucking caffeine... Must be...<br />
<br />
Walking along the back streets meant a longer trip home but, it was worth the waste of time. Besides, you met all kinds of colorful people on the back roads. Like that couple across the street over there, making out like nobody in the world is watching. A sigh left Min&#39;s lips... &quot;I wish I could have that...&quot; The words muttered under her breath but, she really did feel them deep inside. As she got closer to the couple on the other side, something caught her eye about the girlfriend that made her stop. Maybe she was just seeing things but, where were her legs? The boyfriend must be damn strong holding her up like that but, the dress was too long for a shorty...<br />
<br />
The girlfriend&#39;s legs had in fact begun to slip away under her dress out of view of everyone around. She or her boyfriend didn&#39;t seem to notice as her arms just sort of faded away either. With her arms vanished, the dress just... fell away lying on the sidewalk as the boyfriend held her head and torso in place still ravishing each other. Min actually crossed the street to get a better look at what was happening because either this was one hell of a magic trick or she was going insane... There they were though, her breasts mashed against him as he pulled her closer while her her hips adjusted in the air giving glimpses of the from the side. The show there didn&#39;t last much longer as her hips hollowed from the bottom turning her skin a sleek black as it crept up her torso. Light filtered through as the material she consisted of below blew like fabric in the breeze. Her head just sunk into her now black shoulders finally breaking their kiss as the man opened his eyes to look at the fabric he held in place of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
The freakiest part of all was that... He didn&#39;t even care as her casually folded it up and placed in a floral bag that had somehow replaced the dress on the ground. Min was absolutely baffled as the man crouched at first to reach the bag and yet he straightened out the further her reached. He... He was shrinking?! His legs, pants and all, shrank down with his arms following along with the charade until he was just tall enough to peek into the bag as she set the fabric inside. He stumbled back and fell sitting up as he muttered something to himself casually. It was about that time that Min noticed his arms having turned a dark brown color. Min cautiously made her way forward to better understand the changes as the dark color overtook his head. His shape seemed to lose definition in that darkness until without warning he toppled over on his back. Min rushed forward to check on the man only to find a dark brown teddy bear wearing his clothing in his place. Looking around the street, the few people that had been outside didn&#39;t even notice what had happened.... Only Min... As she placed the teddy bear in the bag... No no, the boyfriend in the bag with his girlfriend she stood up straight. A stray thought ran through the back of her mind...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Min... You wanted it... Now you have it~&quot;<br />
<br />
She did it... Wait... Wait wait wait... I DID IT?!<br />
<br />
Fuck going home! She whipped out her cell phone and messaged her friends &quot;Meet me at the park, now!&quot; They were not going to believe this...<br />
<br />
An hour later, at the park not far from their homes, they didn&#39;t believe her...<br />
<br />
The rather dour looking young woman was her friend, Marcie. She had a case of resting bitch face coupled with dull green eyes and dyed gray hair. She hid her body beneath thick clothing because she got tired of the boys eye humping her all day. Marcie held the teddy bear in her hand staring at him with scrutiny. &quot;I&#39;ll give ya that the clothes are different but, this is just a bear Min...&quot; She haplessly tossed the former man over to Kirsten who fumbled with him before giving him the once over.<br />
<br />
Kirsten wore thick glasses framing her brown eyes while her dirty blonde hair was pulled into a messy ponytail with strands falling around her face. Honestly, she wasn&#39;t much to look at and at the beach... She largely became invisible to most men IF Marcie wore a swimsuit, poor girl... &quot;Yeah, I gotta agree with Marcie on this one... This just looks like somebody went and put doll clothes on it? Oooh, wait... These are really detailed and well made...&quot; Kirsten adjusted her glasses pulling the bear closer to her face. &quot;Maybe someone hand made them? Where ever they got this, they really, really have an eye for detail... You said it was just lying in the street with the bag?&quot; Kirsten gasped softly before shoving the man off to the last of the trio. &quot;You... You don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to go looking for it, do you?!&quot; Easily spinning off to some story in her own mind as she fell quiet.<br />
<br />
Last of the group was, Elaine, short red hair with heavily freckled skin and gray eyes. She wore whatever she had frequently wearing clothes that had seen better days a long time ago. Thinking back to the beach, Min remembered pooling together to get her a swim suit with the other girls. Poor thing was going to wear a bikini so riddled with holes that it would&#39;ve fell apart by the sun alone. Aside from that she was skinny as a rail but, boy did she have a pair... Elaine looked over the teddy man with the eyes of a ch1ld on Christmas day. She embraced it with a firm squeeze nuzzling her face to its own. &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want him, can I keep him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; Min caught herself too late as Elaine excitedly named and squeezed the bear tighter. She had started to think of the man as nothing more than a teddy bear... She shouldn&#39;t be doing that but, she felt as if that was all it was now, just a simple teddy bear... Suppose its ok for her to keep it then... HIM then... Ah... Whatever... Too much to think about... Min came back around as Marcie lifted the second item out of the bag unfolding it in front of them all. A sheer black silk teddy gown waved in the breeze as the girls collectively whistled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now... Whoever this bag belonged to was planning on a hot night.&quot; Marcie spoke dryly but, she had a snide smirk as she turned her eyes on Min. &quot;It&#39;s your size too, gonna keep it?&quot; Elaine was in her own little world again too elated over the teddy bear to really care about the expensive looking gown. Meanwhile, Kirsten somehow lost herself in another story deep inside her head, this one causing a blush to surface on her cheeks. Carelessly tossing the teddy gown back in the bag, Marcie handed it back to Min. &quot;So say you did do this -magically-&quot; She put her fingers up in air quotes. &quot;Care to demonstrate your oh so mystical ways?&quot; She stared with mock expectation as Min looked around for something innocent to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll turn their shirt blue.&quot; She pointed at a man wearing a red shirt nearby, surely that would be easy... Nothing... &quot;Ah... Uhm... I&#39;ll give her green hair?&quot; She pointed at an old lady on a bench and again nothing...&quot; Before she could pick another target, Marcie pointed to Kirsten with a scoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t ya give this one bigger tits?&quot; Marcie chuckled and shook her head.<br />
<br />
While it was worth a shot, Min just sighed in defeat. &quot;Maybe that&#39;s all I can do today... I just know this feeling that I did this and those were people...&quot; The trio giggled at the seeming joke as they started going their separate ways. Elaine lingered just a bit longer and waved the teddy bear&#39;s arm. &quot;Thank you so much for Billy, I&#39;ll take good care of him, promise.&quot; She skipped off as she left Min alone at the spot they sat. Billy... She named it Billy...</p>
