<i>(Bracketed italic text indicates internal thoughts)</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Non-bracketed italic text</i> indicates mental influences & suggestions.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Linda unintentionally strutted around the compound, swaying her hips side to side as she did so. To say that she had mixed feelings about their current situation would be an understatement: The more conservative part of her psyche was frightened at how comfortable she&#39;d been in her new body, while she saw her now-adult children take the changes on with stride; Meanwhile, her latex mind kept suggesting that she should just give in to her new desires, and cast aside such silly nonsense like &#39;decency&#39; & &#39;prudishness&#39;. She was caught in the middle of both: Wanting to revel in her new changes, but too scared to do so.<br />
<br />
As the lights around the compound came on, she found a single-story building with an &#39;Admin Office&#39; sign screwed into one of the front doors. Going past the unlocked doors & turning on the lights, she was met with a layout similar to an open office: Although each corner desk was given a small shelf & dividers, anyone sitting at any one of the desks could see the rest of the office without any major issues. The office itself was in a mess, with various stapled documents left untouched on certain desks. In front of her was a straight path towards 2 rooms, with &quot;General&#39;s Office&quot; & &quot;Meeting Room&quot; nameplates respectively in each of the left & right door&#39;s nameplate holders.<br />
<br />
Despite not intending to, she caught herself moaning from the idle gropings of the larger & shinier funbags that she had now. &quot;Eep!&quot;, she yelped out, shaking her head before putting both of her arms to her sides immediately afterward. <i>(Linda, you know better than that. Sure, you&#39;re definitely sexier now and the pleasures feel great, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to become a total slut… Wait, where did that first part come from!?!)</i><br />
<br />
Deciding that searching the office was a better use of her paw hands than anything else right now, she went through the documents that were strewn about the office. While they were heavily redacted, a few clues were made clear:<br />
<br />
1) This place used to be an active military research base, and was still active up until recently;<br />
<br />
2) A 4-Star General was in charge of the entire compound & the staff for it, with the entire thing kept as a military secret;<br />
<br />
3) The same General was indicted in an embezzlement scandal, which subsequently led to the immediate shutdown of the compound by the rest of the Army. The compound was supposed to have been back up & running by now, but a quick look around the place clearly showed otherwise.<br />
<br />
<i>(This place is a mess… They must&#39;ve been in a hurry.)</i> Linda thought to herself. Despite that, there was pretty much nothing else in the open office, with the exception being a handheld barcode printer she found in one of the cabinets. <br />
<br />
As she set the barcode printer down on one of the desks, she saw her erect vulpine prick bob up & down with each step that she took. Pulsing with desire, her prick dripped with the same translucent black lubricant that she had leaked when they were all in the pack&#39;s car. <i>(Pack? Why do I think of them as my pack?)</i> She furrowed her brow as she wiped off the lubricant with a single motion, inadvertently stroking her cock up its length, causing her to shiver from the brief euphoria that she felt with that stroke. That brief window of inattentiveness caused her to continue to stroke her erect member, sending more of that same bliss to her latex mind.<br />
<br />
<i>(H-hha-aa… W-What am I doing!?)</i> She broke out of her daze and wiped off the remaining lubricant with one final stroke, the pleasure of which she held out her best against. It was clear to her that her new latex prick would be the part of her that would do her in, and thus she needed to avoid paying attention to it as much as she could. <i>Even if that felt great,</i> she needed to keep her hands off of it to stay sane. <br />
<br />
<i>(I need to continue searching, or else I&#39;ll soon be acting like a total slut…) But that isn&#39;t bad, right? She would be enjoying herself just like her pack.</i> After shaking her head in an attempt to get rid of those thoughts, she made a beeline straight into the &quot;General&#39;s Office&quot;, finding the door into that room unlocked as well.<br />
<br />
Her search of the &quot;General&#39;s Office&quot; wasn&#39;t as fruitful as she had hoped: The documents & memos in there were pretty much the same as the ones out in the main office. There were redacted documents for various research projects, classified & redacted personnel records, and shredded documents in the bin underneath the table, but nothing that would be of direct help to her right now.<br />
<br />
The only noteworthy item that she found was a small box of various military rank patches that spanned the entire spectrum of the Army&#39;s ranking system. The patches for each military rank were sorted into the metal box&#39;s individual compartments, with a quick summary of the Army&#39;s enlisted & officer ranks stuck to the inside of the box&#39;s lid. <i>(Might be worth something when we get back.)</i> was her thought as she got back up from behind the General&#39;s desk set to the box beside the barcode printer.<br />
<br />
It was then that the orange & white fox saw her own reflection through the full-height mirror mounted on the other side of the office: As her gaze drifted downwards & she set the box on the table, she saw the new voluminous near-perfect spheres that she had for breasts now, along with her new hourglass figure, her new body&#39;s curves showing off almost all of her new &#39;assets&#39;. Drifting further downwards, her eyes saw her lengthy vulpine rod standing at attention, throbbing with need, as well as the two large spheres of latex factories that came with her new prick. <i>She looked better than she was just yesterday, younger too.</i><br />
<br />
As she turned to look at her rear, she saw her own perfectly round & firm bubble butt, as well as the thick pair of thighs to go along with her wider hips. The only thing left out of the picture though was the female counterpart to her vulpine latex prick: Despite her best attempts to do so, she couldn&#39;t clearly see her lady parts on display, as they were being obscured by either her rear end or her new pair of latex testes.<br />
<br />
In order to do so though, she would need to <i>lie on the floor & spread her legs</i>, just so that she could get a better look down there.</p>
