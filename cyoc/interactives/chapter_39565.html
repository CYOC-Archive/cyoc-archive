<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Realizing what was going on before anything could go on, Nate broke off the passionate kisses given by Ty. Then Nate pushed Ty off of him in an uncomfortable way.</Br>
<Br>Ty smiles in a confused sort of way. "What is wrong Nate? I thought you wanted someone to spend your life with?"</Br>
<Br>Nate hung his head low in shame and embarrassment. "I... I do, but I know you are just doing this to be nice."</Br>
<Br>"What are you talking about Nate. Can't you tell that I really do like you? You know, I don't think you understand why people don't like you..."</Br>
<Br>A little bit of anger in his voice mixed with the deepness from the werewolf part of him popped out. "You know, you are right so why don't you enlighten me?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't want to make you angry, in fact I am kinda scarred of what you could do to me when you are angry. I like the werewolf part of you as I like the human side, I just like the wolfy side of you more."</Br>
<Br>"Oh you are, are you. You are scarred of me, the quiet werewolf no one likes? Why do you like me, especially my werewolf side so much?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest, I have always thought that werewolves were hot and that I never thought I would meet one in real life. I am scarred because I know how primal it could get for you, to the point where you wouldn't hesitate to rip me limb from limb and feast on my entrails..."</Br>
<Br>Nate's anger diminished slightly as he smiled from the comment.</Br>
<Br>"I also like the werewolf side of you because that is who you are. The reason people make fun of you, honestly, is because you don't like who you are and they feed off of that Nate. They pick on you wanting you to fuel them and give them all the reason in the world to make fun of your difference. I don't know why though, especially since there are others in the school who are different. Shit, you said it yourself!"</Br>
<Br>Nate looked at Ty sheepishly. "Yeah, I know... I guess I have been scarred like you, but for another reason. Since werewolf kind has existed, we have been feared and hunted. Remember, I told you the back story of my family."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, of course I do, that was like fifteen to twenty minutes ago."</Br>
<Br>"Well... I guess that the people who hate differences in others would hate me too. Enough to become a werewolf hunter and kill me, the last of the werewolf blood."</Br>
<Br>"Nate... that is ridiculous! Why would anyone do that?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't know! Why don't you tell me, since you are the expert here?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest, I... I can see your point, but I don't think it would ever come down to that."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, but even you acknowledge the chance of it happening. I am sorry Ty, but I just can't be with you. I can't risk spreading my lineage, even on a sweet guy like you who might want to be like me. I will just have to remain alone forever."</Br>
<Br>Annoyed with Nate now, Ty decides that it was time to play hard ball, but without using his powers. Ty wanted Nate to be himself, to be the messy typical guy like he could see throughout the majority of the house.</Br>
<Br>"Well... you are just a chicken shit punk bitch."</Br>
<Br>Furious with the comment from someone who was being so nice to him earlier, anger rose in his voice. "What did you just call me?"</Br>
<Br>Knowing that his plan was working, Ty inwardly smiled. "You heard me Nate. You are a chicken shit punk bitch! You are just a scared little werewolf who wants the world to leave him alone! Well I am sorry, but you and your kind are immortal to an extent and you are going to be on this earth until there isn't one!"</Br>
<Br>Angrier now than he had been before, Ty could hear a low ominous growl come from within Nate. Ty could tell that Nate was trying to hold back his werewolf self, but was failing. Ty could see Nate's teeth elongate, his face push out slightly into a muzzle, his muscles bulking out into their awesome size like earlier, fur sprouting from his pores where Ty could see visible skin, claws lengthening from his hands and toes through the now tattered socks.</Br>
<Br>Huffing and puffing, trying to keep in control, Ty could hear the rage billow out while Nate spoke. "You... you wanted this! Why... why couldn't you just... GAH... leave... me... BE!!!"</Br>
<Br>"Because I want you to be who you are! Embrace what you are and be the werewolf Nate!"</Br>
<Br>Not wanting to give up his now less visible human form, Nate tries to control himself and Ty notices it immediately.</Br>
<Br>"See... I knew it! You are just a chicken shit!"</Br>
<Br>In a fit of uncontrolled rage, Nate lunges out and slices into Ty's arm. Unable to control the werewolf side, Nate finishes transforming, ripping all of his clothes off and exposes his beercan thick cock. Ty, knowing that he unleashed the beast smiles.</Br>
<Br>In his wolven and gravely sounding voice Nate laughs. "So... this is what you wanted all along?" He pauses, pointing down with a wolven finger to his throbbing piece of meat, dripping pre from excitement. "If it is, go ahead and take it! I don't think you could even fit in that small human mouth of yours!"</Br>
<Br>"Well..." Ty smiles sheepishly. "it is what I wanted, but I wanted you to be yourself and more importantly I wanted what you just gave me."</Br>
<Br>Nate's amber eyes widen in shock and horror at what he just did. His concerned nature took over his enraged one and he slowly transformed back into his human form while approaching Ty. Once his transformation finished, Ty saw Nate in all his naked glory. Nate was nicely tanned, he had nicely developed muscles all over his body which he covered up by wearing a couple layers of clothes to make himself look flat instead of the curved man Ty saw before him. Like his muscles, Nate must have used a paling agent to make himself look whiter than the bronzed male before Ty. Ty smiled as Nate approached him to inspect what he had done, noticing that Nate's cock was slightly smaller in his human form but was still impressive.</Br>
<Br>"Oh my God... what I have I done? I can't believe I did that to you and now you are going to be a werewolf just like me. Why did you make me angry, why did you make me do that to you?!?"</Br>
<Br>Ty looked at Nate in concern and compassion, knowing that he felt terrible. As Nate turned away, not able to look at the future monster to be, like Nate, Ty grabbed Nate's shoulder and turned him to face Ty. Knowing that no words could suffice, Ty gave Nate a light kiss on his lips that said more than words ever could.</Br>
<Br>"Just so you are clear on things, that kiss is a thank you." Ty said as he held Nate's chin in the cup of his hand.</Br>
<Br>Nate half smiled, not sure about things and just looked Ty in the eyes. "Well... I don't know what is going to happen now. I guess you and I will just have to live with each other being monsters."</Br>
<Br>Ty smiled consolingly. "You and I are not monsters, we are each a werewolf and together... we are a couple."</Br>
<Br>Nate smiled fully this time, happy with Ty's caring words. "You know, I want to thank you for forcing me to change... it always feels wonderful to be free of the human bonds. I also wanted to thank you for getting me to turn you because I don't think I ever would have on my own." Nate finished by planting a long, drawn out, sensual kiss where their tongues intermingled while swapping saliva.</Br>
<Br>As Ty pulled off, he did so with a huge smile, knowing that he found a great and sexy guy for once in his life. "You are welcome Nate. You and I will now have a long time to spend together, so how do you want it to start?"</Br></p>
