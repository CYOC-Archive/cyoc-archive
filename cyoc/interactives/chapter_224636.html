<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You’d been a female before, so you knew what it was like.  Females were sometimes weaker than males, but otherwise the bodies were mostly the same when it came to hunting.  The real difference was afterwards, during the orgy, but that wasn’t something that you would notice if you weren’t fucking – or getting fucked.<br />
<br />
What you’d never been before was pregnant, and being a pregnant female was a much different experience from just being a female.<br />
<br />
The skin on your belly was stretch painfully taunt, plus the kicking and squirming never stopped.  As soon as one of the kits tired itself out, another would start.  If you moved too fast, bent too much, or just turned into the wrong direction, you’d irritate the bodies inside of you and they’d all let you know it.<br />
<br />
Your body felt heavy and tired.  The oxygen in your blood, which should have been feeding your limbs with energy was instead feeding the pups inside of you with life.  That left precious little for your own body, and you could feel it in every fiber of your being.<br />
<br />
You’d barely managed fifteen minutes at a slow trot before you’d had to lay down, careful to slowly flop over on your side so as to avoid putting any undo pressure on the kits that filled your stomach.<br />
<br />
As you laid there, you became aware of just how much your erect teats ached.  You could feel the warm milk sloshing around behind them, filling what little space there was as it tried to leak out of your nipples.  But no matter how much the milk may have wanted to escape from your body, just like your kits it was trapped inside – at least for now.  <br />
<br />
Both of those were problems with the same solution, but you didn’t know what you would prefer.  To struggle through the birth of twelve kits and be relieved of the various burdens that now plagued your body, or to continue to bear those burdens and avoid the agony of a long labor.<br />
<br />
The scent of rotten garlic and flowery arousal wafted through your nose – the skunk.  Your keen sense of smell told you that it was nearby.  It was the kind of hunt that go could very bad, very quickly, but you were in no real danger and, besides, you’d had a long conversation with that guy on the way out here.  He’d seemed like a cool dude, and you didn’t want to see him trapped as a female skunk for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Well… that wasn’t true.  If you devoured him then he would have been trapped as a female skunk for the rest of his life, but the point was still the same.  You could free him of the burden of continuing to exist in such a wretched body.<br />
<br />
You slowly stood back up, only to unleash a chorus of squirming and kicking into your pelvis – despite your best attempts at making the process as easy as you could for the kits inside of you.<br />
<br />
Once the kits calmed down a bit, you resumed your trek through the forest as you headed towards the skunk’s scent.  Your progress was just as slow as before – your body was tired, and the feeling of overfilled breasts sloshing beneath you as overeager kits wriggled about inside was a constant distraction.<br />
<br />
You trudged through the leaves, over fallen logs, under dense foliage, and eventually arrived at the source of the smell.  In front of you was a small clearing where light penetrated through the overwise thick forest canopy.  Sitting in the middle of the green blanket that covered the ground below were two skunks.<br />
<br />
The top skunk, clearly male, was currently distracted as he pounded away on the skunk below him – on the man from the van before.  Unlike when she’d put the suit on, and her eyes had taken on that glassy look that spoke of the fact that her mind was shackled to the heat that raged through her body, she now had a clear, conscious look to her.<br />
<br />
The male whose cock was filling her cunt had broken the mental cage that her heat had placed her in, though his larger body, which was currently smothering her from above, now served as a new, more physical cage that she was unable to escape from.<br />
<br />
As you walked to the edge of the clearing, you heard a trig crunch beneath your paw.  The male kept on fucking, oblivious to anything but the tight cunt wrapped around his cock.  The female, on the other hand, looked up and peered straight into your eyes.<br />
<br />
You don’t know how she knew, but you could tell that she recognized you despite your rather pregnant, vulpine body.  And you knew that look in her eyes – it was a look that you’d seen on prey many times before.  She knew what she was. <br />
 <br />
She knew that once the male was done fucking her the heat would return.  She knew that she’d spend the next two weeks getting her brains fucked out while she subsisted on a diet of berries and worms.  She’d never catch anything and Andrew would decide that she was one of the lucky prey who survived.  <br />
<br />
She’d go on living out the life of a female skunk, stuck in this forest, with a litter of kits growing inside of her until they filled her belly and she looked just like you – gravid and ready to burst.  Then she’d give birth, go back into heat, and spend the remainder of her life trapped in a body that could do little more than produce babies and stink.<br />
<br />
That look told you everything you needed to know.  She wanted you to devour her, and you were more than happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
You crouched down and tensed the muscles in your legs as your prepared to leap across the clearing, taking the male by surprise before devouring the willing female underneath.  Your butt wiggled in anticipation as you began a familiar countdown.<br />
<br />
3.<br />
<br />
You’d done this same leap so many times before.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
<br />
You’d bite down on the neck, instantly killing the prey.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
<br />
Then you’d-<br />
<br />
Before you could finish the thought, there was a popping sensation from deep within your body, almost like a balloon breaking, that was followed by the feeling of a flood of water surging through your hips.<br />
Pain lanced through your body as every muscle in your stomach suddenly tensed and a tremendous feeling of pressure followed the sound of water splattering on the ground below you.  The pain was unlike anything you’d ever felt before – your entire stomach felt like it was tearing itself apart as it pushed down towards your cunt in a desperate attempt to tear its way out of your body.  <br />
<br />
The shock of the situation caused you to lose your balance and flop over onto your side, crushing the leaves and twigs below you as you let out a loud, pained howl.<br />
<br />
When you looked back up towards the skunks in the center of the clearing, you saw that the male had paused its thrusts to stare you straight in the eyes.  Its cock still wedged in the female below him, it let out a loud hiss, hoping that would be enough to deter you so that it could resume its prior business, rather than having to let the female go to spray you.<br />
<br />
The female, for her part, was still looking at you as she slowly shook her head back and forth.  Her eyes wide with understanding, you knew that she fully understood the gravidity of your situation.  Despite that, she was still trying to beg as best as her knew body could.  Somewhere, deep inside, she was still holding out hope that you would be capable of fulfilling your rose as a predator.<br />
<br />
But with the male now aware of your presence, both you and your van buddy knew that it wasn’t going to happen.  Even if you weren’t in labor, foxes were ambush predators and skunks excelled at ruining the day of anything stupid enough to attack them from the front.<br />
<br />
You laid there, enduring the pain as your uterus struggled against itself.  The male continued to stare you down and the contraction subsided.  You laid there for another minute or so, then rose back to your feet. <br />
 <br />
There was a feeling of sopping wetness that ran from your hips to your cunt – the remnant dampness of your water breaking.  And while your stomach was sore, with the contraction over you felt ‘normal’ for lack of a better term, not that normal was a particularly desirable state when your were a vixen at term, but it was still better than the contraction had felt.<br />
<br />
That sense of normality caused you to very briefly entertain the thought of making another go at the skunks, only for another contraction to ripple through your belly.<br />
<br />
Once again, every muscle from your crotch to your ribs grew as tight as they could in an attempt to wring your body like a body.  The only thing that prevented your body from doing just that was your spine, which proved to be a strong, rigid object that the muscles pulled against.  Arching your back as you bent into your stomach as much as possible, you once again endured the sensation of your guts attempting to force their way out through your cunt.  <br />
<br />
The pain was tremendous, but no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t stop the muscles from tensing.  It was as though they had a mind of your own, and you were merely a passive observer in a pained body that was openly defying your will.<br />
<br />
You whined and grunted as your muscles wriggled back and forth and then, as suddenly as it had come on, your stomach relaxed and you were left with the angry kicks of the kits whose bodies had just been crushed by the now hostile home in which they resided.<br />
<br />
There was nothing you could do for the female skunk – hunting was completely out of the question while you were in labor.  Labor.  You were in labor.  There was no avoiding that.  No matter what you wanted, no matter what you did, no matter who you had been, all that mattered was what you were now.  A pregnant vixen who had gone into labor.  The only way to change that was to give birth.  And the only thing you could accomplish by staying here any longer was to get sprayed.  The only thing that would accomplish is to make what came next all the more difficult.<br />
<br />
So you did the only thing you could do.  You turned and left the clearing as you plodded back out into the forest.</p>
