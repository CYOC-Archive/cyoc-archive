<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances remained calm and took a deep breath as Jade relaxed with her infant daughter, Hope. By now, Jade had returned to her human form and had Hope softly cradled against one of Jade&#39;s E cup breasts. Frances was fairly happy to see that the woman was doing well, especially with the fact that her husband&#39;s actions had put him in a situation where his health and survival was on the line. And from what she knew from Samantha, it was unlikely that Dymixious would have seen freedom had he not fought. Her best guess that Moon Lake would make a request for jurisdiction, trial, and incarceration for Dymixious had he not fought, but given the look she&#39;d gotten from the EMTs outside the home that Dymixious and Jade had been placed in that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ARE married, right?&quot; came Jade&#39;s voice from beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...?&quot; Frances managed snapping out of some private thoughts and looking up to Jade.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seemed rather focused on my chest,&quot; Jade commented, &quot;I understand that werecats are at least bisexual... but I don&#39;t swing that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances felt herself blush for a moment, &quot;Sorry... It&#39;s actually pride as seeing you with Hope. As I said... I&#39;m a psychiatrist. I&#39;ve never been there for the delivery of a baby before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade felt herself smile at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a part of me DOES wish to have a baby... one that is of mine and my mate&#39;s DNA,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;but since I&#39;m a lesbian and my wife is female...any child either of us could have is only going to have half of the pairing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be all you could do... and I&#39;m sure you could find a male that would be a sperm donor for you,&quot; Jade commented, &quot;and if you don&#39;t want a sexual encounter... wouldn&#39;t artificial insemination work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like ONE baby, not eight,&quot; Frances found herself chuckling and drawing a small smile from Jade as well, &quot;and I suppose... the daydream... just sort of imagines that Samantha and I would manage to conceive together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade managed a small smile. While she would have wished that Dymixious could be there for the birth of their child, she did like Frances. She&#39;d had to leave her for a while in the early afternoon to deal with a different psychological issue, but since Hope was hers and Dymixious&#39;s first child, labor took it&#39;s time. It was now getting late in the evening as she suckled Hope to her chest. The only thing that Jade could hope for was that there would be an update on Dymixious, and that while Jade accepted what the Moon Lake&#39;s police had said about his temper and tactics causing MORE problems than they solved, that didn&#39;t mean she wished her husband ill.<br />
<br />
It was at that point when Doctor Tora Tachibana knocked on the door alerting both of them to his presence. Frances and Jade both looked up to see him standing there calmly. He slowly entered and gave a half nervous glance to Jade and then to Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong with Mr. Harper?&quot; Frances asked, thinking of the patient presently in another part of the hospital.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment, no,&quot; Doctor Tachibana spoke, &quot;but I was just finishing my rounds when I was informed on something rather... difficult...&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of the women noted that his voice fell off at the end. That carried a rather ominous tone with regard to the overall situation that Jade was in with regard to her husband&#39;s fate, and Frances knew that. It was something that Frances was a bit nervous over and she looked over to Jade who sighed heavily and looked down for a moment or two before she looked up to Doctor Tachibana again.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s dead... isn&#39;t he?&quot; Jade said weakly as a tear fell down her cheek, &quot;Dymixious didn&#39;t survive battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Tachibana nodded and looked down for a moment, &quot;Yes... He died on the operating table from the wounds sustained in that the shot to his chest came too close to his heart.... The damage was too great. Doctor Robblestein did his best, and had they been able to arrive sooner, he might have had enough time to get your husband stabilized...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a rather awkward silence where no one said anything. Eventually Tora continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if this too stressful... particularly after everything that has happened today,&quot; Doctor Tachibana spoke, &quot;but I thought it best to let you know before either A) you overhear a nurse talk about it or B) you read about it in our local news... Someone may put in judgements that show a lack of tact that wouldn&#39;t be helpful... And I figured it better to let you down gently.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade sighed and nodded. She could still feel her daughter nursing and had the realization that Hope would never know her father. She didn&#39;t blame the Moon Lake Police or the hospital for Dymixious&#39;s death, they were only doing their job, and in the situation they were in, it was never an easy position to look into. At the same time, she couldn&#39;t entirely blame the FBI for searching for Dymixious, as they likely didn&#39;t know that Lionel Ulysses was a were and what her husband had done had been intended to do good and protect the were secret. Misguided it may have been, but not evil, and the FBI didn&#39;t know that. And while she knew that Dymixious could have stood to control his temper better, Jade didn&#39;t really blame him either. Much of what Dymixious had learned, he&#39;d learned from his father who seemed far more eccentric than Dymixious had been, and both had been dedicated to the were secret&#39;s protection and to a degree the protection of humanity by removing rogue weres from the equation.<br />
<br />
As Jade cradled her daughter, the only one thing that Jade could really blame for her husband&#39;s death, was the were secret. It seemed to be something that was and generated problems, but at the same time was something that was the only thing that protected weres from outright extermination. She&#39;d known enough that weres, particularly in Christian Europe had been extensively hunted as agents of the devil during the middle ages, and others faced other persecutions elsewhere in the world and for other reasons. Thus, while weres may have never become true pacifists and a fair number had fought in many of humanities wars over the years, they kept their identity as weres secret from those around them. It protected them from persecution and let them hide in plain sight, but it became a difficult thing to protect. When a were went rogue, there was the potential that the were would expose were society by accident or design, and arresting that were wouldn&#39;t be the end of it and in a sense forced weres like her husband to take up roles that were no longer truly viable at protecting the secret. However, Jade had no answer on what was the best solution to that problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jade,&quot; Frances said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Jade managed after a moment, &quot;and thank you doctor for telling me... I know my husband didn&#39;t put anyone in this town in an easy position. I&#39;m sorry that things turned out the way they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all are,&quot; Doctor Tachibana spoke, &quot;we all our.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade did her best to hold back tears and then sighed, &quot;If you&#39;ll pardon me... I&#39;d like to be alone for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Doctor Tachibana and Frances nodded and they moved toward the door. Frances glanced over her shoulder before she left. She could see some tears going down Jade&#39;s face and knew that the revelation that Dymixious didn&#39;t survive the battle was a tough one. But it was getting late and she figured she&#39;d need to get back home to check in with Samantha and Ben, make sure they were okay and let them know exactly what had gone on during the day. She&#39;d check in on Jade the next day, to make sure that she was coping okay and would talk to Samantha about making sure Moon Lake did what it could for Jade Drake, as she couldn&#39;t be responsible for her husband&#39;s crimes.</p>
