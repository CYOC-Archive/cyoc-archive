<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>So was Yvette looking for some kind of &quot;ideal&quot; father figure, husband, or both?</i> wondered Doctor Frances Twist, as she contemplated how to proceed. There was still plenty of time left allotted for this session. She didn&#39;t have to be back in the office for her Friday appointment with Jenny Harper until 10, and she wasn&#39;t scheduled to see Jen Decker and her son Tad until noon, provided they came and wanted to talk.<br />
&quot;So, what is your ideal man?&quot; Frances asked Yvette Smith, the rogue were whose mental state she was trying to determine for the courts before sentencing her on two counts of violating Moon Lake Statute 1A.*<br />
&quot;MAN?&quot; said Yvette in shock, as if Frances had just told her she was ugly or something. &quot;Why would I want a man?&quot;<br />
&quot;You used to. At least until recently, although your methods of finding one is what led to us being here now,&quot; pointed out Frances.<br />
&quot;And you see what it got me,&quot; replied Yvette, giving a brief tug to the handcuff that was keeping her chained to the bed. &quot;No. My ideal mate is definitely female,&quot; she added with a smile.<br />
&quot;Which is odd, considering your past opinions of bi females, let alone lesbians. What changed your mind?&quot;<br />
&quot;In all honesty Doctor Twist? I only have one answer for that. Jennifer Harper,&quot; said Yvette with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to explain?&quot; asked Frances, anxious to hear the answer.<br />
&quot;Well, I freely admit that until I was... forced to complete her transformation, I was totally against the concept,&quot; began Yvette. &quot;I had been offered the chance to do... duets before. That&#39;s when two women team up either to pleasure the male customer or let him watch them as they put on a show having fun with each other. Kind of like choosing a specific movie on Netflix. You understand what I&#39;m saying?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Frances, not happy that there was a were sex trade industry, &quot;but why is it called a duet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because when requests are made, the customer&#39;s presence is a given so he&#39;s never counted. A solo act is you and the guy. A duet is two women and the customer. You get the idea. Anyway, duets pay more than solo performances, but I could never bring myself to do one. If I could have, I would have avoided Harper like the plague. The only reason I clawed her to begin with was to create a distraction in hopes of escaping Moon Lake and being free somewhere else. Yet, if I had done that, I would never have known how wonderful female on female intimacy was,&quot; said Yvette with another smile on her human face, as she reached under the blanket covering her body with her free hand.<br />
Frances could smell Smith going into heat as the scent of female pheromones grew stronger as she said, &quot;Those couple of hours I spent with Harper in the hospital safe room were marvelous! I never knew sex could be so great without having some guy&#39;s cock physically penetrating either your mouth, vagina or anus; and all we had were our fingers, tongues, and tails to play with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances watched Yvette shudder, as her sensitive werecat nose confirmed the prisoner had just experienced a self induced orgasm, and was rapidly on her way to having another.<br />
<i>This makes no sense,</i> realized the therapist. <i>Given her strict upbringing, the old Jenny would never of had a chance to even <b>ask</b> a sexually based question of her parents, let alone &quot;experiment&quot; with any of her friends if she was ever curious. Yet Yvette is making Jenny sound like a Mistress of Sappho.</i><br />
&quot;So, not to sound crude, but it was just the fact that Jenny was great in bed?&quot; asked Doctor Twist, promising herself to get Jenny&#39;s side of the story later today.<br />
That made Yvette stop in mid-self pleasure and say, &quot;No. The sex was great, but there was something... Like I said, I was VERY reluctant at the start and despite her growing need to complete her transformation, Jenny was reluctant too. She admitted to me that she didn&#39;t know the first thing about women, other than being one herself, so she wanted to start out with us just holding each other, like she and her boyfriend Harry do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; urged Frances.<br />
&quot;Anyway, I crawled into bed, laid next to her, and pretended she was... a guy,&quot; said Yvette, not wanting to admit she was still thinking of William Anderson at the time. &quot;As we were laying there snuggling, the hormonal imbalance of her new were libido soon started getting the best of her, but for me, it was something completely different.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was light at first, like the tingling sensation I presume every were feels at the start of their transformation process. But as it continued, soon I started feeling better. Not only for just holding Jenny, but as if a great weight was being removed from my soul. I started realizing everything I had ever done wrong in my life. All the bad mistakes and errors. Especially the most recent in regards to her and poor William Anderson. According to the wall clock in the safe room, it was only about five minutes from when I first touched Harper until we had our first kiss, but by then I was already silently vowing to turn over a new leaf and become a better person and were. By the time we actually started getting more intimate, I had already decided that my ideal mate was female, provided I can ever find one willing to have me after all the wrong I&#39;ve done in my life. The sex just showed me what I have to look forward to if I ever do find the right lady to love and marry,&quot; revealed Yvette.<br />
&quot;The two of you were in there for a good couple of hours,&quot; pointed out Frances, not recalling that she felt a similar tingling experience the first time she ever hugged Jenny herself**. &quot;Just how–&quot;<br />
&quot;Neither of us knew the first thing about pleasuring another woman before we started,&quot; said Yvette, &quot;but we learned fast.&quot;<br />
&quot;And your feelings toward Jenny Harper now?&quot;<br />
&quot;I will always be eternally grateful to her for showing me the error of my ways and helping me get my life straight; and if she ever wants to get together again, I&#39;d be more than willing,&quot; replied Yvette, while licking her lips in anticipation. &quot;But I know better now than to ever force myself upon someone else, were or normal. Besides, she&#39;s truly and deeply in love with Harry Jenkins, and I hope he knows just how lucky he is to have Jenny in his life.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think he does,&quot; was all Frances was willing to say about that. &quot;And what about William Anderson?&quot;<br />
&quot;If I ever get the chance to do so, I&#39;m more than willing to apologize to him, his wife, and anyone else I have to. Not sure they&#39;ll believe me, but it&#39;s something I should do and will be seriously sincere about.&quot;<br />
Frances simply nodded before asking, &quot;So what&#39;s your image of an ideal mate now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to say, considering my limited experience with women so far,&quot; admitted Yvette, before thinking about it. &quot;Female, a compatible were in regards to being with a werevixen. Not more than an inch or so above or below my height in either form. Loving, caring, willing to help me change, reform, and stay on the right path the rest of my life. And she better know how to cook, because the best I can do in a kitchen is run the microwave.&quot;<br />
&quot;You never answered my earlier question. What was your ideal man before &#39;seeing the light&#39;?&quot; asked Frances, still uncertain if she believed Yvette Smith was truly reformed or not.<br />
&quot;Handsome. Rich, or at least, better off than I am. GREAT in bed. A compatible were no more than a decade older than me at the most. A little bit like William Anderson in regards to being intelligent. But also charming, humorous, and dashing; a lot like Uncle Bart.&quot;<br />
<i>Funny you should mention him,</i> thought Frances, before saying, &quot;I noticed there is a vast difference between your ideal man of the past and your ideal woman now.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Yvette. &quot;I told you this is still new territory for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t mention love in regards to the man, but seriously stressed it with the woman in regards to <i>loving, caring,</i> and <i> willing to help me change, reform, and stay on the right path the rest of my life</i>.&quot;<br />
Yvette arched her eyebrows in surprise at that observation. &quot;I&#39;ve obviously grown and matured of late.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps you have,&quot; was Frances&#39; only reply.<br />
<br />
