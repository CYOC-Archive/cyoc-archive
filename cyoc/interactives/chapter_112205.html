<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Nate and his sisters stared silently at one another for just a moment but to him it felt like an eternity.  Mandy just looked at him with her mouth agape but Alice huddled behind her older sister seeking protection.  Her obvious fear made Nate feel a little guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain, &quot; he said gruffly.<br />
<br />
Mandy closed her mouth and crossed her arms, glaring at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just bet you can,&quot; said Mandy angrily.<br />
<br />
Nate quietly pondered his choices.  What could he tell them?  How could he explain his transformation?<br />
<br />
Mandy rolled her free hand impatiently, encouraging him to continue.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, go on. You have our full attention and we are eagerly awaiting your explanation.  I am sure it is going to be a good one,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
Nate sighed and decided to tell them the truth.  It was really his only option.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... I&#39;m a werewolf, &quot; he said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!?&quot; asked Alice with some excitement.  Now that she was sure that the raging beast was not going to tear her apart her curiosity compelled her to get a closer look at her brother.  She moved in front of her older sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Mandy with obvious disbelief.  &quot;That is the best you can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the truth!  I swear!&quot; said Nate earnestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; said Alice as she shot forward and stood next to her brother.  She began to rub the fur on his thigh. &quot;So soft!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Nate, &quot; said Mandy angrily. &quot;Why do you tease her like that?  You aren&#39;t fooling anyone.  I know this is a costume.  We all know about your weird obsession with werewolves.  We just didn&#39;t say anything because we thought it was harmless.  But when Mom and Dad see this they are going to freak.  It must have cost a fortune!  And getting a costume that is anatomically correct .... you should be ashamed.  Take it off right now and maybe we can return it or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I don&#39;t think it is costume, &quot; said Alice, as she continued to rub his thigh.  She pinched his skin, trying to separate the costume from his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; hissed Nate.  &quot;Stop that!  It smarts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; said Alice triumphantly.  &quot;It&#39;s not a costume.  It&#39;s his real skin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy rolled her eyes.  &quot;Oh, for god&#39;s sake!  What did you do?  Glue some fur to your skin?  Or maybe apply some latex?&quot;<br />
<br />
She stomped up to him and began to feel his leg for herself.  Alice was right. It was soft.  It didn&#39;t feel like a cloth costume.  It felt warm, almost like it was alive.  She could even feel the large bulging thigh muscles twitch - muscles she knew her little brother didn&#39;t have.  A little unnerved she began to circle around her brother, carefully inspecting his body.  But try as she might she couldn&#39;t find any seam or zipper.  Her patience at its limit she stood on her tip toes and tried to pull the mask off his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; Nate growled loudly.  He snarled and stood up to his full height, pulling his head out of her reach.  &quot;That hurt!  Don&#39;t do that again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy studied her brother&#39;s face in mute fascination.  The ears twitched.  The lips snarled.  The mouth&#39;s motions matched his speech.  Even the pupils of his yellow eyes constricted as he glared down at her angrily. This was no costume.<br />
<br />
Mandy slowly backed away from her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, get away from him, &quot; she said softly as she continued to slink away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; said Alice defiantly  as she continued to stand by her brother. &quot;It&#39;s okay.  He is a good werewolf.  Aren&#39;t you, boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice began to scratch and rub Nate&#39;s belly.  He whined happily and his tail wagged merrily back and forth.  It felt really good and his paw began to involuntarily beat against the floor rapidly.<br />
<br />
The sight of the big monster acting like a puppy made Mandy giggle.  Relaxing at little, she began to realize that he was not going to hurt them.  The huge monster could have easily mauled them or even killed them, but had instead tried to reason with them.  Regardless of how frightening the beast looked, it was still her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?  He likes it, don&#39;t you boy?&quot; said Alice happily, as she continued to pet him.  &quot;Come join me.  It&#39;s fun!  And he won&#39;t bite.  Will you, boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate shook his head, his eyes still closed and his tongue lolling out of his mouth as he enjoyed the scratching.  He whined and encouraged her to increase her efforts.<br />
<br />
Mandy sighed and stepped forward to pet her brother.  It was a peculiar request, but everything about this night seemed unreal.  She began to lightly stroke his thigh.  The fur was so soft.  It reminded her of a warm bear rug.  She began to scratch harder, rubbing his thigh and belly.<br />
<br />
Nate was in pure bliss.  The scratching and petting was so soothing!  He could have stayed like that all night.  But after several minutes, Mandy had to ruin the fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough, &quot; said Mandy, as she stopped scratching him.  &quot;Time for some answers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s thoughts cleared as his sisters stopped petting him and the pleasure faded.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy grimaced, frustrated at how dense her brother could be and not intimidated in the least by his large size. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do I mean? What do you think I mean, you big idiot!?  How did you get like this? Why in the hell are you a werewolf? Did you get bit or something?&quot; asked Mandy apprehensively.<br />
<br />
Nate chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing like that, &quot; he began, outlining the whole story of the website and the potion he purchased.  His sisters listened with rapt attention, hanging on every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean there is a store that sells potions that will turn you into anything?  Like a unicorn?  Or a Pegasus?  Or even a fairy?&quot; asked Alice excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot; said Nate with genuine confusion.  &quot;They had a lot of options,  but I didn&#39;t look at the list in any detail.  I really just scanned over it until I found what I wanted and ordered it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the website?&quot; asked Alice eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now.  None of that, young lady, &quot; interrupted Mandy.  &quot;I recognize that look and it can only mean trouble.  One transformed sibling is already more than I can handle.  And this is only for one night, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded.  &quot;It should be.  At least that&#39;s what I understood from the instructions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.  So what now?&quot; asked Mandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Nate with some confusion.<br />
<br />
Mandy rolled her eyes.  Her brother really could be slow sometimes.  &quot;Well, obviously you didn&#39;t want to spend the night playing dolls with your sisters.  If you only have one night, you should make the most of it.   So, what did you have planned? What do you want to do now? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &quot; said Nate, blushing and a little embarrassed, &quot; the truth is .....&quot;</p>
