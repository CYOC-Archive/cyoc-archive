<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was grueling work scrubbing one cock after another. After a while, Mark got used to it. He even got used to the occasional shower he got when one of the cocks fired. Mark learned quickly how to predict when a cock was ready to fire and get out of the way before he got dirty. Mark wondered though if a few guys held it waiting for Mark to show up before they let lose.<br />
<br />
Mark also met some of his coworkers since 1500 cocks was too many for just one cleaner. Mark quickly got to where he could clean a cock in under a minute but he learned from his coworkers that it was best to take his time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we&#39;re expected to average about twelve minutes on each cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that would increase the odds of causing orgasms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so. You&#39;re doing your fellow students a favor. Don&#39;t leave us all just hanging with no release.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s against the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So don&#39;t let the administration catch you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark began to realize that there was practically no security here. The supervisor was often calling in sick and smelled of beer. The one or two technicians were usually sneaking off to look at porn. Even the janitor took frequent smoking breaks, sometimes smoking right next to the vault. Smoking was one of those sins that students weren&#39;t allowed but several of his coworkers would time their work to be near the janitor on his smoke breaks and the janitor would purposefully blow the smoke directly at those coworkers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, the vault is the best place to get away from all the school&#39;s stupid rules. Isn&#39;t that ironic?&quot;<br />
<br />
One day, Mark happened to run into the dean and casually asked why the security was so low in the vault.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are just dicks. Who would want them? They&#39;re nothing but trouble. If we could somehow destroy them without causing the students to weaken and become like women, we&#39;d do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
On another occasion Mark overheard the dean say, &quot;Women--In one religion, they are inferior beings, innocent but useless. In another, they are morally weak, prone to sin. In another, they are wicked seductresses to be shunned and avoided. It&#39;s a whole mess of moral dilemmas that I just don&#39;t want to mess with here at this school. Please discourage all boys from any involvement with women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark began to enjoy his job. It was the only place he could truly throw off the rules and have some fun. He found where his own cock was kept and he also found his buddy Key&#39;s cock. Mark wasn&#39;t gay but it was hard for Dickless U students to find girlfriends. About the only females interested in dating a Dickless U were dominating control freaks that wanted to keep boys on short leashes. So Mark decided it was fine for he and Key to &quot;comfort&quot; each other during their time at this crazy college.<br />
<br />
Mark made an arrangement with his coworkers to move Key&#39;s cock next to his own so that they would always be washed together. He also gave instructions on how he wanted them cleaned. &quot;Please turn the water temperature up a little and be more gentle.&quot; Mark timed the washing to the second to make sure he and Key would be together. Even if it happened in the middle of class, Mark would just reach over and hold Key&#39;s hand giving him knowing smiles as they pretended they were paying attention to the teacher.<br />
<br />
If the dean caught any two boys making out, they were severely punished and they also knew which other staff members to avoid but many of the staff members knowingly turned a blind eye. The locker room for example was an interesting place. It was common for the boys to make out in the shower and the coach acted like a lookout warning the boys if one of the stricter teachers was coming. Then the boys would line up for inspection.<br />
<br />
One day, while Mark was working in the vault, part of the wall and roof were torn off. It was Henry, one of his coworkers. Henry grabbed several cocks and then headed over to the other vault and grabbed several assholes. Mark tried to get his attention to ask what he was doing but Henry couldn&#39;t hear him. Mark went to the blue disc to get big again but it was too late. Henry got away.<br />
<br />
Mark went back to check on the vault and found that his own cock had not been grabbed but Key&#39;s cock had been. Mark learned from his coworkers that Henry had a bad drug habit and had probably gotten desperate for money. Later that day, Mark learned that his own asshole had been taken but Key&#39;s had not.<br />
<br />
Because of the way the blue discs had been applied, they couldn&#39;t unlock them and retrieve everyone&#39;s body parts that way. The locking mechanism was on the disc attached to the genitals. Then all the students who had parts stolen began experiencing sex randomly and frequently. On one day, Mark had his ass plowed non-stop for eight hours. The dean was frantic to get their parts back and stop the boys from having sex. He couldn&#39;t punish the boys since they didn&#39;t have any control over it. Instead he apologized to the boys profusely.<br />
<br />
But life went on at the school, as best as it could with about thirty different boys randomly moaning and groaning at odd hours of the day or night.<br />
<br />
The students were typically not allowed to leave the campus but they could get passes sometimes. One time when Mark and Key had passes, they decided to check out a new bar that had just opened about a month prior. They walked in and the place was very dark. The music was loud and about the only thing they could see were the glow sticks that people held. It wasn&#39;t the kind of place either of them wanted to be in and they asked if there was a quieter place.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have quieter rooms in the back but it costs ten dollars just to be allowed back there. It is the perfect environment for a couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark and Key decided to give it a try. After paying the ten dollars, they went through the door. It was still dark but not quite as dark and it was much quieter. But then the boys heard faint moaning and groaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look they even have names. This one says Key and this one says Mark. Isn&#39;t that delicious. I think I&#39;ll put the Key in the Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark and Key both jolted and gripped each other&#39;s hands tighter. As their eyes adjusted to the light, they saw that several cocks and assholes were mounted all over the room. Most were on the walls at crotch height.<br />
<br />
Key ran off to the bathroom leading Mark to follow. Key acted like he wanted to escape but in the bathroom, they saw worse. Instead of urinals, three assholes were mounted on the wall.<br />
<br />
Mark wrapped his arms around Key. &quot;Don&#39;t look baby.&quot;</p>
