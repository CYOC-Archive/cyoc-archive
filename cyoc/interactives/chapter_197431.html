<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the advantages of Gemory&#39;s current height (Danielle pegged her at about 4&#39; 10” or so), is that she was fairly lightweight.  So without a word, Dani scooped up her fiancee and carried her to their suite.<br />
<br />
Gemory didn&#39;t put up much of a fuss, but she did squawk when she was tossed onto the bed.  “What was that for?!”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s what I want to know!  Look, I know that compared to you, I&#39;m an infant at best, and there&#39;s a lot of things I don&#39;t know, like what went down between you and Raphael, but as far as I can tell, she was trying to mend that rift, and you just pushed her away in tears!”<br />
<br />
Gemory&#39;s stubborn look faded slightly.  “She was crying?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yah she was!  So, help me to understand.”  Danielle crossed her arms (without realizing it, mimicking the Devil&#39;s favored stance).<br />
<br />
&#39;Do I really look like that?&#39;, Gemory thought to herself.  “Danielle...are we having a fight?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know!  Maybe.  Oofa.  I don&#39;t want to fight with you, but it really feels like you were being unfair to Raphael.”  Danielle found a chair and sat down heavily onto it.<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  Danielle was a mature and sensible young woman, but how do you abridge millenia into an explanation?  “Ok, maybe you&#39;re right.”<br />
<br />
Danielle raised an eyebrow.  “No argument?”<br />
<br />
Gemory threw up her hands.  “You want me to explain a lot of stuff in a short time!  I don&#39;t even know where to start!&#39;<br />
<br />
“Oofta.” Danielle sighed.  “I guess I&#39;m being unfair.”<br />
<br />
“No.  I trust your feelings.” Gemory sat cross-legged on the bed.  “Sometimes an outside perspective is needed, I guess.  The thing is, yes, I&#39;m holding a grudge.  The reason they&#39;re called the “Famous Four” is because when Michael raised arms to put down Lucifer&#39;s rebellion, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel were his chosen lieutenants.  Despite only being Second Tier Angels, everyone followed them.<br />
<br />
When Lucifer was cast out, a lot of us surrendered.  But there was no justice, no hearing.  We were all punished equally.”  Gemory looked away.<br />
<br />
“So when you said she cut off your wings...”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  She did it personally.  Where was her love and mercy then?”<br />
<br />
Danielle ran a hand through her hair.  “Ok, so I get it.  Ever since, you&#39;ve been enemies, on opposite sides.  Then she just shows up, acting like nothing happened.”<br />
<br />
Gemory nodded.  “I kept trying to figure out her angle.  Obviously she was up to something.”<br />
<br />
“No, I don&#39;t think so.  I think she came on too strong.  But what do I know.  Maybe it&#39;s time to change my diaper and put me down for bed.”  <br />
<br />
“Danielle.  I don&#39;t think of you as an infant.  We&#39;ve had this discussion.”<br />
<br />
“Well I sure feel like one!  I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.  Marrying a Demon?  Getting involved in all this religious nonsense?”  <br />
<br />
“Danielle.  Come here.”<br />
<br />
Dani got up and moved to sit on the bed.  Gemory stood behind her and started rubbing the taller girl&#39;s back.  “You&#39;ve been under a lot of stress.  You&#39;re not a baby, and you&#39;re not a fragile little flower, but you&#39;ve had to adapt to a lot of things in a short time.  I&#39;ve...been treating you like an equal, and maybe you&#39;re not ready for that.”<br />
<br />
“I want to be.”  Danielle started to relax.<br />
<br />
“I know!  And I love you all the more for it.  I never thought I needed a partner, but now that I have one, I don&#39;t know how I went so long without.  I need you so much it hurts.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah..same here.”<br />
<br />
Gemory hugged the girl.  “But I keep forgetting that I need to protect you.  Somehow, in my mind, I&#39;ve started to think you can handle yourself.”<br />
<br />
“What, you already forgot about that thing with Mom?”<br />
<br />
“No.  But I thought after you finally did something with all those negative emotions, you&#39;d get better.  And you have, but healing is a process, and you need time.  Maybe we should go someplace where no one can find us, and just have some time to ourselves.”<br />
<br />
“Mm.  That&#39;d be nice.  But...we&#39;d have to bring T+A.  Can you imagine the trouble they&#39;d get into on their own?”<br />
<br />
Gemory giggled at the nickname.  “T+A, that&#39;s hilarious.  I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d noticed Amielle&#39;s behind.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not really a butt girl, but she has a cute little ass.”  Danielle smiled.<br />
<br />
“Cuter than mine?”  Gemory teased.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  You have a sexy ass.”  <br />
<br />
“Maybe I&#39;ve been a bad Devil, and I need to be spanked?”  <br />
<br />
“No.  I think you need to be punished, and you&#39;d like that too much.”  Danielle said.<br />
<br />
“Do I really need to be?”  Gemory tried to sound remorseful.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve racked up a few infractions, and I remember what you said about demons.  You need discipline.”<br />
<br />
Gemory pouted.  “I guess you&#39;re right.  What are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“You need to make up with Raphael.  I don&#39;t expect you to be lovey dovey, but at least hear her out.  Until then...”  Danielle touched her chest.  “I wish I was as flat chested as a little girl.”<br />
<br />
Danielle&#39;s breasts immediately shrank in size, her nipples becoming small and pink.<br />
<br />
“Gah!” Gemory hadn&#39;t expected that!<br />
<br />
“You said I need to deprive you of something you like.  Does this count?”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re too harsh by far, my love.  But I accept my punishment.  Should I go now?”<br />
<br />
Danielle turned around and kissed her lover.  “I think we can have a little funtime first, don&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Amielle was trying to process what had just happened.  “I don&#39;t understand, Toni.  I expected to be punished.  Instead Raphael just wants me to report to her.”<br />
<br />
“Well that&#39;s a good thing, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
Amielle frowned.  “I shouldn&#39;t have made that offer.  Spying on you feels like I&#39;m betraying you.”<br />
<br />
Toni moved into her lover&#39;s lap.  “Hey.  You&#39;re not spying on me, you&#39;re spying on Gemory.  And she&#39;s not my Boss anymore.  You are.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t want to be your Boss, I&#39;m setting you...”  Amielle trailed off, as Toni shushed her with a finger against her lips.<br />
<br />
“Ami, I&#39;m a demon.  A Succubus.  I was bad in life, and sold my soul.  I need to be submissive to someone, or I&#39;ll cause mischief.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, but...”  Ami frowned.  “I&#39;m not really good at being a Dom.”<br />
<br />
Toni laughed.  “I know.  And I don&#39;t want you to change.  But there are times when you may have to rein me in, you know?”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s the best way to do that?”<br />
<br />
Toni thought about it.  “Grab my tail.”<br />
<br />
Amielle hadn&#39;t really given much thought to Toni&#39;s tail before.  It was long and whip-like, ending in a meaty bulb in the shape of a heart.  She took it in one hand.  “Like this?”  She gave it a tug.<br />
<br />
Toni gasped a little.  “That...works...but grab the end.”<br />
<br />
Ami held the tip of Toni&#39;s tail in her hand.  She gave it a squeeze.<br />
<br />
Toni moaned with pleasure.  “Oh...shit...”<br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness!  I had no idea that&#39;s what this was for!”<br />
<br />
“Y...yeah.  Easiest way to keep a Succubus in line.  Our tails are erogenous zones, and the tip is especially sensitive.  And since I can&#39;t shapechange, it&#39;s always there.”<br />
<br />
“Well we do want to fix that, don&#39;t forget.”  Ami pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Y..yes.  But even in another form...you know how we can be intangible, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh I see.  It&#39;s always there, even if you can&#39;t see it.  So if you get out of line, I can just give it a good tug?”  The Angel grinned.  She liked this!<br />
<br />
“Or grab the end or...uh...bite it.”<br />
<br />
Ami was about to do just that when she heard Mist call out.  <br />
<br />
“Not out here, girls.  Take that to your room!”<br />
<br />
Ami blinked.  “It&#39;s that intense?”<br />
<br />
Toni grinned sheepishly.  “You have no idea.”<br />
<br />
Scooping up her lover, she made her way to their suite.  “Sorry, Mist!:<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s ok.  Go have fun, you two.”  The Valkyrie chuckled.  Oh, to be young again!<br />
<br />
<br />
Toni lay on her back on the bed, and Amielle was seated at her feet, holding her tail.  “Angels don&#39;t really have something like this.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...it&#39;s pretty unique to my kind.  Well, wait, what about your halo?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, that...you know, I have no idea.”  Ami admitted.<br />
<br />
“You never touched it?”<br />
<br />
“N..no.  I mean.  It&#39;s sacred.”  Ami blushed.  Hers didn&#39;t come from God, but it had been granted to her when she was reborn as an Angel.<br />
<br />
“Ah.  You should!”<br />
<br />
“Are you tempting me to Fall from grace, demon slut?”  Amielle glared at her lover, but grinned.<br />
<br />
“I think we&#39;re beyond that point, angel slut.”  Toni replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh my.  I am a slut, aren&#39;t I?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but I love you for it.”  Toni grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well, I can&#39;t do that now.  The light would hurt you.  I mean, I&#39;m not as powerful as Raphael, but still.”<br />
<br />
“I can take it.”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“Maybe later.  I think it&#39;s something we should talk to the others about.  Speaking of which, how did you talk with Gemory go?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah!  She says she&#39;s never heard of a Succubus feeding on herself before, but higher-ranked demons do become self-sustaining.  She thinks I may have stumbled on a shortcut!”<br />
<br />
“So you will become stronger?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, she thinks so, but we won&#39;t know until I evolve.”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“Evolve?”<br />
<br />
“When demons achieve a new level of power, their true form changes.  Like, I could get bigger wings, or horns.  Or something else.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s fascinating.”  Ami nodded.<br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t it the same for Angels?  I mean, Lucifer has six wings.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, Angels don&#39;t really rank up.  They can get more powerful, as you&#39;ve seen with Raphael, but actual promotions are super rare.  I only know of one, off hand.  The Famous Four were offered promotions, but they all turned it down.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, who is the one, then?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“That would be the Metatron.  In life, she was a prophet, so she&#39;s a Second Class Angel, but God promoted her to a position roughly equal to Sandalphon&#39;s.  While Sandalphon is the ruler of the Angels, when Metatron speaks, it is with the authority of God.”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s she like?”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea.  I&#39;ve never heard her voice directly.  Actually, the highest level Angel I&#39;ve interacted with was Diane, my old Boss.  She was a Principality.  Oh uh, a Dominion did come into her office that one time, but I was eating Diane out under her desk, and I didn&#39;t dare stop.”<br />
<br />
“Jeez.  That&#39;s my submissive Angel alright.”  Toni shook her head.  “Diane is an odd name for an Angel, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a nickname.  Some Angels have names that can only be expressed in our own language, and they can be quite long.  The Hebrew names, usually ending in -iel, or -ielle, which is a feminine form, are loose translations of their true names.  For example, &#39;Amiel&#39; means &#39;My People Belong to God&#39;.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  And you&#39;re the only one with that name?  Seems like something that should have been handed out before.”  Toni seemed thoughtful.<br />
<br />
“I believe it was, but when Angels Fall, their names are usually retired.  So I am probably the second Amiel.”<br />
<br />
“What happened to the first?”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea.  Most likely, it wasn&#39;t one of the ones in the Rebellion.  That would be in bad taste- and some of them had any memory of their names blotted out.  But there were other groups, like the Grigori who sired the first Nephilim.”<br />
<br />
“I wonder what Nephilim are like.  Mist&#39;s daughter is one.”<br />
<br />
“From what I was told, most were very tall and beautiful.  But some had monstrous features.  So think of Demigods like Gilgamesh or Herakles, or Gorgons like Medusa.”<br />
<br />
“Wow.  That&#39;s crazy.  Demon kids can have some odd feature, like horns or hooves, I&#39;m told.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that&#39;s right.  You&#39;re a Succubus, so you can bear children.”  Ami remembered her lessons.<br />
<br />
“Y..yeah.  I haven&#39;t yet.  Does that mean we could have kids?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“Maybe.”  Amielle bit her thumb in thought.  “Since we can&#39;t take male form, the Ban of Raphael basically means that to have a Nephilim child, we have to carry them to term.  Which I&#39;m told is very uncomfortable.  But I&#39;m not sure what would happen if we were to mate.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d probably have to become an Incubus and get you pregnant, right?”<br />
<br />
“Why Toni, do you want to be a mother?”<br />
<br />
The demon girl blushed.  “I...I don&#39;t know.  I mean, it&#39;s scary because I did used to be a guy.  But at the same time...I&#39;d really like to have your child.”<br />
<br />
“You are beautiful, Toni.  I love you so much.”  Amielle smiled at her lover.  “I think...I think there&#39;s a way to do it.  Do you want me to try?”<br />
<br />
“Really!?”  The demoness blinked.  “Yes!  Yes, please!”<br />
<br />
“All right.  Tell me, how do Succubi ovulate?  You don&#39;t have a menstrual cycle, but you do have eggs?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, yeah.  And um, no shock, it happens when you overload our pleasure centers.”  Toni shivered.<br />
<br />
“Oh, like last night when I went inside you?”  Ami grinned.<br />
<br />
Toni just nodded.  Even now, that experience was too intense to put into words.<br />
<br />
“Then we&#39;ll have to do that again.  But first...”  Ami brought the tip of Toni&#39;s tail to her mouth, and she bit into it.  &#39;Mmm, spicy&#39; she thought, and then Toni screamed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mist hadn&#39;t been kidding, Ami thought to herself.  The tip of a Succubi&#39;s tail really was incredibly sensitive!  Toni had climaxed almost immediately!  Of course, Ami hadn&#39;t stopped there.  She was currently shrunken down to mere inches in height, and she was soaked in Toni&#39;s cum.  It tickled her body in a rather pleasant way.  Making love to Toni from the inside was a wonderful experience, all told, and she was actually a little envious.<br />
<br />
She wanted to know what it felt like very badly!  Toni had dozed off, completely drained of stamina, and now Amielle contemplated her next move.  Shrinking down even more, she soon became microscopic in size, and traveled up her lovers Fallopian tubes, until she found it.<br />
<br />
An egg cell.  Toni&#39;s egg.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s surface was resistant to her touch, but if she became small enough, it would become permeable.  Straddling the cell, she began to shrink even more, and sure enough, her legs began to sink into it&#39;s surface.  At this point, Amielle began to pleasure herself, forcing two fingers into her slit while teasing her breast with her free hand.  She had no need to stabilize herself in this position- Angels have perfect balance, after all.<br />
<br />
Something about where she was, deep inside her lover&#39;s body, was driving her wild.  If this worked, she would be impregnating Toni, but more than that, she felt a profound sense of...naughtiness that she was basically fucking the tiny egg cell.  She was rewarded with waves of pleasure as her back arched, and she perched there, letting her cum sink into the surface of the egg.  She then extricated herself from it, and watched.<br />
<br />
The miracle of life had begun.  The cell changed form, and soon, started to divide.  Amielle watched, mesmerized by the process.  But eventually, she sensed Toni was starting to stir from her torpor.<br />
<br />
Growing large enough that her hand would not sink into one of the cells of her...their...child, she promised to come back soon.<br />
<br />
Then she spread her wings, and flew back out of her lover&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
<br />
Toni came to slowly.  If she&#39;d found that she&#39;d turned into a pile of goo, she would not have been surprised, but instead, she was drenched in glistening sweat.  Used to they are to the extreme temperatures of Hell, Succubi didn&#39;t normally sweat- unless they were seriously overheated.<br />
<br />
“Ami?  She called out.<br />
<br />
A tiny spark of light appeared, and hovered in front of her face, before growing in size, until she could make out the form of the tiny Angel.  Amielle didn&#39;t manage to become much larger as she descended to land on Toni&#39;s right breast, straddling her nipple.<br />
<br />
“S...sorry...took a lot out of me.”  Her voice was tiny and high pitched.<br />
<br />
Toni gently touched her lover&#39;s back with the tip of one finger.  “Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Just need a bit.  I can&#39;t recharge like you can.”<br />
<br />
“So what happened?”<br />
<br />
Ami raised one arm weakly, giving Toni the thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Toni squealed in joy.  “Really?!  I&#39;m pregnant?”  She carefully picked up the Angel, who was only about 2 inches tall, and brought her to her lips.  “Sorry, this is the best kiss I can give you.”<br />
<br />
Toni then reached out with her tongue and started licking the Angel, who giggled and tried to bat the gigantic tongue away, but she was so weak right now Toni could barely feel her blows.<br />
<br />
Toni then rolled over to one side, curling up her body, cupping Ami in her hands.  Ami felt very safe, and decided a short nap was in order...</p>
