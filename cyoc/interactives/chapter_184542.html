<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maureen&#39;s evening finished with Ray (the professor) walking her home. She reluctantly said goodbye and left him outside. She was in Liz&#39;s body and tempted to invite Ray in for a nightcap (and was sure she would not have been refused) but knew that wasn&#39;t fair on either Liz or Roger. Reluctantly she said goodnight to Ray and he left but not before reminding her he would ring with details about the dinner he was taking her to. Maureen went inside telling herself that Ray was a nice guy and that Liz wouldn&#39;t mind going out with him. She tried to convince herself that she had done the right thing.<br />
<br />
Maureen had another problem though. She recognised she was in no fit state to drive and she had told Liz she would return to her own house at 10 so the two women could swap back into their correct bodies. It was 10 already and Maureen would need to order a taxi. She decided she had better text Liz first and inform her she would be a bit late. It was only then that she saw the message Liz had sent her earlier. She replied. &#39;Running late. A great evening but too much to drink. About to order a taxi. See you soon&#39;<br />
<br />
Liz had by that stage gone home with Roger but instead of wanting to go bed Roger had suggested they have a &#39;Bailey&#39;s&#39;. Liz knew that Maureen enjoyed a drink and eager to play in character accepted. She had already had the best part of a bottle of wine at dinner as Roger who was driving had limited himself to a single glass. While Roger made the drinks Liz went to the toilet. <br />
<br />
Roger heard his wife&#39;s phone ping and was curious as to who would be sending her messages at this time of night. Was it Kaitlyn their pregnant daughter? Was something happening? He picked up the phone and checked the message. It was Liz. He read the message. Instantly he thought back to earlier in the day and the kiss. Then he remembered Maureen&#39;s suggestion about it being okay for he and Liz to flirt, kiss and cuddle. That seemed totally out of character for Maureen..... And now Liz was coming over?  .... At 10pm?<br />
<br />
Things were all happening too quickly. Roger put together his thoughts and 2 plus 2 equalled 5. Liz was coming over with the intention of having a three-some! Maureen had seemed like she had something on her mind all night! She had sexed it up as well! She had been wearing the black dress she had last worn to a nephew&#39;s wedding and heels like he had not seen her wear in years! He remembered well taking the dress off her at the hotel they were staying at. The sex had been great that night!<br />
<br />
All night he had sensed Maureen was up for it and it had of course made him excited. He had tried to be the perfect gentleman and knew not to push things too quickly. He had got positive signals in return. And now he knew why! Maureen must have been as excited as he was with anticipation! And to think that he had pigeon holed Maureen as conservative when it came to sex! Until today he had never guessed she was up for a threesome! It had been a fantasy of his but one he had never dared to mention. He couldn&#39;t be unfaithful to Maureen but it wasn&#39;t being unfaithful to her if she initiated the action! Oh it was all happening so quickly. He emptied a glass of Bailey&#39;s in one gulp and poured another. He put the phone back on the bench where Maureen had left it. He would pretend he knew nothing.<br />
<br />
Liz returned from the toilet to find Roger holding out a glass of Bailey&#39;s for her. She accepted. She had just experienced a wonderful day as &#39;Mrs Manning&#39; and was determined to enjoy the few minutes she had left. Her only problem was that she needed to get Roger into bed before Maureen returned so they could swap back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your phone just pinged&quot; Roger informed her. Liz picked up Maureen&#39;s phone and read the message &quot;Anything important?&quot; Roger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Just Liz. She&#39;s going to drop by&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At this time of night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz tried to think of a reason for such a late visit &quot;Hmm I guess she wants to tell me about her dinner party. Maybe she met somebody&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t that wait until tomorrow?&quot; said Roger playing innocent. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Liz. She can be pretty spontaneous. There&#39;s no need for you to wait up though. Why don&#39;t you go to bed? I&#39;ll wait up and see what she wants&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew. I was sort of hoping... Well you look very sexy tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to bed. You never know your luck. I&#39;ll join you later&quot; Liz giggled to herself. When Maureen did go to bed she would no doubt find a randy husband waiting for her.</p>
