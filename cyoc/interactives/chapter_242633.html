<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer heard a silent knock on the window. On the other side of the window there was a high-schooler boy with a beanie who held a piece of paper with handwritten text on it which read.<br />
<br />
“Come talk with me to the backyard.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer carefully opened the house’s backdoor and saw the boy standing on the small terrace opening.<br />
<br />
“Quick question. Is your mom home?” The boy asked with a whisper.<br />
<br />
Before Jennifer answered she looked at the boy from head to toe. The boy looked like a high-school freshman. He had a beanie, a sweatshirt, a jeans and pair of boots on him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. She’s home.” Jennifer whispered back to the boy.<br />
<br />
“Damn. I was hoping if we could have had some alone time together.” The boy grunted.<br />
<br />
“Alone time, as in you mean like, sex?” Jennifer asked boldly as both of them continued whispering.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. That. But, like, okay here’s the deal. I haven’t told my mom what I’ve done but, you know, how’s your mom? Is she cool?” The boy asked while looking from side-to-side for something, or rather, for someone.<br />
<br />
“I think so?” Jennifer replied back.<br />
<br />
Then she heard her mother was exiting the room she was just in and was approaching the backdoor. Jennifer panicked and told the boy to come later. She wanted to ask more question from him as he might be the reason why she was still pregnant.<br />
<br />
In the nick of time the boy was able to run away from the backyard and Jennifer’s mother, Silvia, had no clue that her daughter had even talked with a boy.<br />
<br />
Later on the same day the boy came back while Jennifer informed to him that her mother was busy at somewhere else. Jennifer heard the boy’s name and it wasn’t Alex. His name was Gregory. He had no idea who Alex was as they weren’t even the same age. Gregory was a 16-year-old high-school sophomore student making him two years older than Jennifer was right now.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wanted to confirm one thing and secretly on the bathroom called to Alex to ask if they were still together. Alex was confused and explained to Jennifer over the phone that he still loved her even if he got her pregnant at such a young age. Jennifer gasped and couldn’t believe her ears. Alex thought that the baby inside her was his. Things were getting complicated as it seemed that Jennifer was cheating with his middle school crush with an older boy and the older boy got her pregnant.<br />
<br />
Jennifer told Alex how much she loved him and closed the call.<br />
<br />
When Jennifer arrived back at her room. Gregory attempted to give a kiss and acted very pushy towards Jennifer. He was clearly come to this room with one single objective in mind.<br />
<br />
Which was to have sex with Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jennifer got worried and tried to swindle herself out of the situation but like a cosmic force. Jennifer couldn’t say no to Gregory and soon both of them were naked on top of Jennifer’s bed.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t tell if the sex was good or not as Gregory had no idea what he was doing and flailing his cock on top of Jennifer’s pussy like an idiot. It was better sex what she had with Alex but even that wasn’t such a high bar to cross. Jennifer’s pregnant belly made the thing even worse. Jennifer couldn’t stay on same position for too long and in the end Gregory decided to masturbate and shoot his semen on top of Jennifer’s belly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt dirty.<br />
<br />
Gregory quickly walked towards the front door and left the house without saying a word. He had gotten the thing he had wanted and Jennifer was left alone to think all by herself. Jennifer sat on top of her bed naked drenched in man juices.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer! I’m home!”<br />
<br />
Jennifer panicked when she heard her mother’s voice coming downstairs. Her mother was approaching Jennifer&#39;s room like a speeding bullet and soon Silvia’s eyes went wide. Jennifer knew what was going to happen and it was too late to say that she was sorry. Silvia ordered her daughter to the bathroom to clean herself. Jennifer received a mouthful from her mother and a long rant how Jennifer was acting like a bad girl for having sex with boys while her mother had turned her back on her daughter.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s countless apologizes went to deaf ears and soon the sky was engulfed with a dark shroud as it was night time.<br />
<br />
The next morning things didn’t look that great either. The pregnant belly was firmly stuck on Jennifer’s gut as it showed itself from The pajama shirt’s midriff and the dent looked bigger than it was yesterday. Jennifer saw her phone on her nightstand and flipped it open.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Jenny. See you soon?”<br />
<br />
It was the recent text from her “new” boyfriend named Frank. Jennifer scrolled through the phone and saw Alex’s name still on the list. It seemed that the setup was the similar as it was yesterday. Jennifer woke up younger with pregnant belly to a different boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Wanna hit the movies this afternoon? I can pay for both of us.” Frank texted to Jennifer as soon as Jennifer had seen the previous message followed by a, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the ride. I can pick you up at your house. My old man &quot;&quot;&quot;borrowed&quot;&quot;&quot; his old car for me. So what do you say?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed. She couldn&#39;t believe how desperate Frank was. Jennifer to tried read through her previous conversations she had with Alex. It seemed to be occurring thing for Jennifer that she had lied to her “crush” as Alex believed that he was the one who impregnated Jennifer. Alex seemed to also worry how he was going to explain to his parents how his girlfriend was one year younger than he was. <br />
<br />
Jennifer closed her phone and lamented to herself if she was ever going to learn to say “no” to someone without offending them.</p>
