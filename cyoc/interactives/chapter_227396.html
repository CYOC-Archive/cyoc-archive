<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Gary Shepard waited in his car. He hated this whole flu thing. Everything about it was so complicated and scary. When he&#39;d heard that Officer Leon had gotten it, Gary had taken so many more precautions. Gary was most concerned about what he&#39;d turn into. The authorities always said that it was random. Some really big guys turned into little foxes, while some really small guys turned into massive gorillas or rhinos. <br />
<br />
However, Gary had a different theory. He&#39;d not seen too many, but really felt like it was based more off personality. Someone like Officer Leon, he was a natural born leader. Everywhere that Leon would go, people naturally seemed to listen to him. That&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t surprising that he turned into a lion. Being the leader of the pride fit his personality perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I was like that...&quot; Gary scolded himself for being fairly weak willed. Even with the flu going around Leon still took charge and maintain his confidence. Meanwhile, Gary was too afraid to leave his house except for work. Even then, he wouldn&#39;t pull anyone over or answer his CV radio unless it sounded incredibly urgent. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed himself a bit more. This time massaging his pants down over his legs. Just thinking about Leon had somehow gotten him boned up. <br />
<br />
A knock on his car window made Gary jump. &quot;Sup?&quot; Officer Leon looked inside.<br />
<br />
Gary scrambled to get out of the car. &quot;H-hey?&quot; Gary&#39;s neck started to crane upwards. Leon wasn&#39;t a small guy, however for him to be this tall was something else. &quot;You&#39;re huge...&quot; He easily towered over Gary now. Easily standing 6&#39;6&quot; and with thick powerful muscle to boot. The police station had to buy him a new uniform to fit him. He&#39;d basically grown out a mane of hair around his face. A thick brown beard covered his chin and sideburns. Then there was the forest of golden hair that ran down his forearms. Some of the guys said that when he took a shower that it was all over him. <br />
<br />
Leon laughed awkwardly. His hand went behind his neck rubbing it gently. The massive bicep flexed. Gary didn&#39;t know if he was showing off or not. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Leon smiled but refused to look Gary in the eye. Two savagely sharp canines were in his mouth. &quot;Doctor said the changes should go back after awhile if I don&#39;t get the flu again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is something that deals with the flu!&quot; Gary shouted. A pang of guilt hit his stomach for needing backup. <br />
<br />
Leon&#39;s massive hand rested on Gary&#39;s head. He gently pet the smaller man. &quot;Ehh... Who cares what the doctor thinks,&quot; he smirked. For a moment, Gary forgot how to breathe. That calm, cool, collected why Leon spoke sent a shiver through him. His dick throbbed with excitement. If not for his mask, Leon would have surely seen the bright red that now covered his face. &quot;So which way did he go?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Gary a moment to orientate himself. His mind kept flashing back to Leon&#39;s body. The officer could barely fit in the new uniform and it hugged tightly against every inch of his body. The sleeves clung to his arms. The buttons on his shirt strained against the meaty pecs. Every bit of his ass could be seen as though the pants were practically see through. Gary bit at his bottom lip. He&#39;d always been a bit bi, but this was ridiculous. <br />
<br />
&quot;That way,&quot; Gary finally pointed down the street. &quot;He made a right and started hopping fences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good. Let&#39;s see if anyone&#39;s seen him,&quot; Leon said. He pet Gary on the head again.<br />
<br />
Gary almost felt his butt wag at the word good. A desire to be called a good boy flashed through him as he heard the word. He shook it off. And started following Leon. With the added height and an extremely confident stride, Gary nearly needed to jog to keep up with the other man. Gary wasn&#39;t short by any means. At 5&#39;10&quot; he was fairly average. Before the Transfor-Flu he&#39;d always tried to maintain a pretty good physique. With his lean muscles he always kept his weight just around 180. Nothing too heavy but not too light either.<br />
<br />
However, with the closing of gyms and extra cautious treatment of everything, that 180 turned into 190. Then it went up to 200. Then 210. A bit of a belly had replaced his abs and made him doughy. Looking at Leon he felt envy run through his body. The already large man only grew larger. Whatever fat he had on him blossomed into hard muscle. Just the slightest bit of movement and the muscle bounced. A deep divot ran between his biceps and triceps. His shoulders were wider. Then there was the added height. Everything gave him such an intimidating posture.<br />
<br />
His dick begged for attention. He wanted so badly to be pressed up against the wall with those massive hands around the back of his neck while Leon fucked him silly. &quot;Ehhhmmmmm...&quot; Gary moaned. <br />
<br />
Leon gave him the side eye. &quot;Everything alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah!&quot; Gary tried to act nonchalant. It was hard. His dick strained in his pants and every step was threatening to crush it. &quot;I was just wondering how the flu went. I hear it&#39;s bad.&quot; They started down Venture street.<br />
<br />
Leon laughed. &quot;I guess to some it might. I mean for me, I didn&#39;t mind it. Since Stacey got it too, we were kind of in the same boat. The craziest part is how horny it makes you. Like fuck. We went at it eight times on that last day.&quot; A smirk filled his handsome face as he thought about all the sex he&#39;d had with his wife. &quot;Course I wanted to fuck just about anyone that I saw. Really had to fight it when the mailman, delivery guy or her family came around. Though... She was the same with mine. Had to carry my brothers out a couple of times.&quot; He laughed again, then flexed his arm. It had to be at least 20 inches around. &quot;Then there&#39;s this too. Like fuck. It&#39;s like I got a decade worth of gains in those couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary&#39;s eyes went wide. He almost reached out to feel the massive bicep. It was nearly as big as his head. Had Leon not pulled away, he probably would have given it a squeeze. &quot;But what about the side effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh... Doctor says they&#39;ll be gone after a few days,&quot; Leon snarled at the thought. &quot;Whatever.&quot; He tried to hide his frustration. &quot;Let&#39;s check to see if anyone would know anything.&quot; Then took a right and headed up onto someone&#39;s porch.<br />
<br />
Gary was quick to follow but tripped on the last step. Leon caught him effortlessly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Gary apologized. He stretched his foot a few times trying to get whatever weird feeling out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;S&#39;alright,&quot; Leon said. He went to the doorbell and rang it. After a few moments the door opened a crack. A forty something year old man peered through the opening. &quot;Afternoon. Can we ask you a few questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about?&quot; the man snipped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Officer Leon and this is my partner Officer Shepard. We&#39;re looking for someone who&#39;s been hoping fences in the area,&quot; Leon explained. &quot;Have you seen anyone about...&quot; he looked back at Gary.<br />
<br />
Gary stepped forward, tripping again. His feet just felt weird. &quot;About 6&#39;3&quot; white male about 20 years old and incredibly muscular?&quot; He didn&#39;t want to alarm the man and mention anything about the Transfor-flu. <br />
<br />
The man glared through the door. Most people began to see the police as nothing more than a bunch of hall monitors who were getting too much into other people&#39;s business. With everything closed, somebody still had to enforce the rules made by the government. However, this man wasn&#39;t talking. &quot;Can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; he answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know if there would be anyone in the area who might house someone like that?&quot; Leon pressured.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of trouble is he in?&quot; the man glared back.<br />
<br />
Leon faked a smile. &quot;No trouble. Just have a few questions for him. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man shook his head. &quot;Nope. Don&#39;t know anything,&quot; then shut the door.<br />
<br />
Gary took a seat on the porch swing. He shoved his finger into his boot trying to figure out what was wrong with his foot. &quot;What a waste,&quot; he complained. &quot;With how fast the guy was running, he&#39;s probably long gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. You did good,&quot; Leon said. He gently pet the top of Gary&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ffffffuuuuuuccccckkkk...&#39; Gary moaned quietly as he was praised. A joy he&#39;d never felt before rushed through his entire system. His dick throbbed. He couldn&#39;t control it. Just feeling the mild compliment was more than he ever imagined. His body jerked as he finished in his pants. &quot;Shit! Shit! Shit!&quot; Gary jumped up and started banging on the door again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Leon asked. He&#39;d never seen Gary so excitable before.<br />
<br />
The door opened just the same. &quot;What?&quot; the man demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go to the bathroom,&quot; Gary snapped back. When the door didn&#39;t budge, he slammed his fist against it. &quot;NOW!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Alright!&quot; the man closed the door, undid the chain and opened it back up. &quot;Damn pigs...&quot; he grimaced as he stepped aside. Gary went into the living room and looked around. &quot;Down the hall. Second door on the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it!&quot; Gary was practically sprinting towards it. He heard Leon apologize and then attempt some small talk. Gary couldn&#39;t worry about pleasantries. He had to know what was going on. <br />
<br />
The door slammed behind him as he went into the bathroom. Gary dropped his pants and underwear. &quot;Damn it...&quot; A massive load was in there. He grabbed as much toilet paper as he could to clean it out. &quot;Did I really get infected?&quot; He thought back to the interaction he&#39;d had with the runner. They always said that there was a bit of brain fog when interacting with people who were currently infected. Then there was a strong sexual desire.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how it usually spread, usually by touching someone else&#39;s bodily fluids. Because of the sexual aspect most reported that&#39;s what caused it. However, there was a few cases where entire gyms had to be quarantined after someone with minor symptoms used the gym equipment  and didn&#39;t clean it afterwards. The whole place erupted into an orgy after about an hour or so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed again as he tried his best to clean his underwear. The smell of his cum was starting to get to him. He gripped the basin on the toilet. The tips of his nails started to turn black. Then they started growing. Claws began to push their way out of his nails and dig into the porcelain toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t be infected. I can&#39;t be infected,&quot; Gary repeated to himself as he dropped the toilet paper into the toilet. However, as he spun around, he couldn&#39;t help but notice the tips of his ears had grown pointed. Black hairs were jutting out of the tips. He gasped. It always started with the extremities. The more a person gave into their sexual urges, the faster the changes would spread. &quot;If I&#39;m infected, Leon won&#39;t think I&#39;m a good boi,&quot; Gary lamented.<br />
<br />
Never in his life had Gary thought about what another man thought about him this much. Each time he thought about Leon, his dick would throb. Even now, he had to grab it again. Blood pulsed into it making the member bounce. He fell against the wall as he grabbed it. &quot;Oh gawd...&quot; he moaned thinking about the other policeman. He could only imagine what kind of man was underneath that uniform.<br />
<br />
The huge muscles the pressed hard against the dark blue shirt and black pants left very little to the imagination. Gary continued to stroke with one hand while the other worked it&#39;s way around his backside. It gently pressed against his hole. Gary&#39;s mouth hung open. His tongue lolled happily out of his mouth as he pushed in further. The strange feeling new feeling of having his asshole opened like this sent a shiver through him. He fell forward, barely catching himself.<br />
<br />
His finger dug deeper, gingerly swirling around his hole. The feeling was intense. He couldn&#39;t stop. All he wanted was Leon to be on top of him. His body craved it. &quot;EEEUgghhHH!&quot; he grunted loudly as he came all over the toilet. It took a moment as he slowly came down from his high to realize what he&#39;d just done. Then entire toilet was now covered in his cum. &quot;Shit. Shit. Shit.&quot;  Gary quickly tried to clean up the mess he&#39;d just made. He grabbed the toilet paper and started wiping.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door made him jump. &quot;Everything alright in there?&quot; Leon called from the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Gary chanted back. A pang in his gut told him that he shouldn&#39;t lie. It was so strong he didn&#39;t even notice that he&#39;d call the other policeman &#39;sir.&#39; He stood up and tried to look to see if anything was out of place. However, as he turned to look himself in the mirror, he noticed the tips of his ears were growing into more prominent points.<br />
<br />
Gary quickly pushed them up into his hat. That&#39;s when he noticed his nails. No longer were they the same pinkish they had been before, rather they were a bit longer than usual and almost jet black. Black fur was starting to cover the tips over his fingers and on the other side there were large callouses starting to form. He quickly put on his gloves.<br />
<br />
Leon knocked on the door again. &quot;You sure?&quot;</p>
