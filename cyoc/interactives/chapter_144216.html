<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In case you are unaware, several characters, besides Raiden, have met their ‘new fates’ beforehand, in the future or simultaneously as Ray becomes Ramesh Riches. Two victims became Ramesh’s Riches maternal cousin Joel Chang, and his father Mark Riches, who were mentioned or in the story.<br/>
<br/>
Ramesh Riches father is from:  <a href="/interactives/chapter_136005.html">#136005</a><br/>
His Cousin Joel is from https: <a href="/interactives/chapter_135865.html">#135865</a></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ray walked over to Eiden’s house, chill as ever as he put on his usual smile. Always up for a game of MOBA with a buddy. Though its a shame Eiden shyed away from his invitations to soccer-mebbe it could man him up a little instead of being cooped up most of the time.<br />
<br />
As described by Eiden’s fantasy, Ray Koh was a cool nerd, and he does exist apparently, being an asian with quite decent muscle as well as playing soccer from time to time.<br />
<br />
“ACHOO!”<br />
“Ugh...fuck this cold.”<br />
<br />
Despite being sick often.<br />
<br />
DING DONG!<br />
SPLASH!<br />
<br />
He heard a loud splash within, as he crooked an eyebrow. Noting the loud rowdy noises from within, as he stood around 5ft 11, judging the teenager within those dorms.<br />
<br />
“Geez...dude is clumsier than I thought...”<br />
<br />
Dressed casual in a plain starched button down tee with light brown khaki shorts and a couple of loafers-the business major just came out of another boring lecture while his other asian bros took engineering...maybe he should have? Oh well.<br />
<br />
‘CREAKKK!’<br />
<br />
It was not long until that the door was opened.<br />
<br />
“Sup dude!” Ray spoke chillstanding outside the door, as he noticed...something really off about Ei...uh...the dude right in front of him. <br />
<br />
He looked...somewhat different from what he could recall, he was much taller and definitely had worked out quite a decent bit. He had this atmosphere to him...a really manly type of aura that seemed to be growing more intensely by the second...but oddly enough...<br />
<br />
The man in front of him kinda looks like...an older version of him...sorta. As that towering figure starred down the shorter asian with those increasingly narrowing eyes, one hand scratchin’ and ruffling a more manlier replica of Ray’s hair, the other holding the phone to his-<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck dude no...NO!&quot; <br />
<br />
His older brother yelled at his phone as he marched back...yeah, the dude was his older brother? Wasn’t he? He was...just visiting his older brother Eiden...wait a sec...<br />
<br />
Who the fuck is Eiden...?<br />
Definitely not his bro...<br />
<br />
RING RING RING!<br />
‘Unknown’<br />
<br />
For some reason, despite it stating it was an unknown caller-Ray picked it up without hesitation. <br />
<br />
“Son...are you certain that you are not gay?”<br />
“Uh...who is this?”<br />
“Ah...my apologies, wrong number.”<br />
<br />
The call ended.<br />
<br />
“What...the fuck?” Ray...was shocked, that very indian Caribbean doctor just asked if he was gay...like it was anything cool about it.<br />
<br />
But most importantly...how did he know that the caller’s race and profession?<br />
<br />
Oblivious to even himself, Ray Koh was actually gay despite being unaware of this fact... for now. To an outsider, and even his gaming buddies, he was pretty straight...but it did strike him when that father said those words. <br />
<br />
“Son...are you certain that you are not gay?”<br />
<br />
Shenanigans happened while Eiden is being completely sealed, as Ray is trying to come into terms with those words...and for the first time ever...his sexuality is questioned into place. <br />
<br />
As those foreign sounding homophobic words ringed in his ears, he entered his brother room. The curse was overjoyed when the gay boy’s member rose at the sight of the gorgeous soccer boi who is now his brother. <br />
<br />
Accentuating the great figure of his every moment, muscle  laying on his arms strongly as they were barely restrained by those sleeves. Those muscular thighs of his...big bro was a striker for Mu Alpha Nu...of course they were big.<br />
<br />
As the changing male...did some actions which...caused Ray’s member to rise higher, the male resisted the thought or possibility that he was gay...almost restricting the curse’s power briefly-but it was all going according to plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO HOMO BRO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden’s feet was a thick rough size 14 and his buttocks were ironclad. His pectorals and slight abs paved the way for his firm back to which...gay guys would drool over. The tanned-yellowish complexion sealed it, Ray had always adored how manly his brother was and followed in his footsteps, sharing the same features of small slanted eyes, but...not as defined features such as his prominent nose and square shaped jaw.<br />
<br />
In this new reality, Ray could not deny the possibility he was a homosexual...<br />
<br />
Ray gushed over Raiden..., but he knew he had to play it cool...not because he was gay or anything! Nope, definitely not his brother! As he continued to put on the loud boisterous facade externally, the gay surely could not help but hide his pitch tent as his older brother held the camera to their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna prank some geeks like old times, bro?&quot;<br />
&quot;You already know what&#39;s the answer , man!&quot;<br />
<br />
BROFIST!<br />
-FLICK-<br />
<br />
———————Livestream On———————<br />
<br />
“YO YO MOTHERFUCKAS! RREALBRAHS ARE BACK ON!”<br />
<br />
As soon as the livestream was on, Ray could only watch his big brother’s loud boisterous mannerisms as he barely hid his blush and...pitched tent. For some reason...it felt quite itchy down there.<br />
<br />
While the completely straight alpha gamer jock flawlessly captivated the audience, Ray was completely focused on his brother... he had to...follow in his footsteps.<br />
<br />
STOMP!<br />
<br />
His feet stomped on its own, barefoot as an even thicker roughness supported his widening soles. His toes definitely wiggled in anticipation slightly, as they toughened...not in terms of running the field-but primarily, staying put. Unaware of the changes, a familiar darker texture is slowly coating around his feet...as his skin tone is taking on a darker, less korean sheen.<br />
<br />
————————————<br />
Outside, his former soccer cleats are refining themselves to become a larger and more expensive. A brand new coating overtook it as new colors washed over it. With the high knee socks brushing the colors of a new race and country that the wearer now belonged to.<br />
<br />
In addition, a couple of similar sized shoes  were placed on the racks, with some scattered on the floor. Notably were the tanned color boat shoes, size 15s as they were even larger than the host’s. <br />
<br />
Within the non-humble abode of the gamer, came even more changes...including the shifting in the pictures and the addition of spare clothing which definitely did not belong to the host.<br />
————————————<br />
His feet took lightly salted-caramel coloration, as traces of Japanese ancestry remained...but refined itself under an even more prestigious scholarly nature as the size 15s stood. <br />
<br />
As the texture and coloration climbed upwards, those lean legs swelled in intensity like cliffs trying to pose a challenge for hikers. Slabs of intense workouts, even more so than a strikers as they traded nimbleness for solid, hard rock muscle as they pushed out thicker and thicker, while the new coloration and ethnicity surges upwards against the challenge.<br />
<br />
His calves were pulsating, the gushing Ray wanted to just observe from a distance, but his far manlier legs had another idea. Sprouts of hair coarse initially , appearing all over the darkened areas before they get SHAVED! <br />
<br />
YELP!<br />
<br />
As though they were being yanked, a slight sensation that allowed the coloration to make a huge leap up his thighs and into his crotch. Causing the new skin tone to bathe his thighs into a huge mass of muscle, one that prefers to be grounded and making huge singular leaps in an effort to defend.<br />
<br />
‘To defend...’<br />
<br />
The thought was added to his mind, as his crotch continued to throb whilst the coloration spared it initially...heading to the other areas as centered around the buttocks, pushing it thicker and tighter as though they were a part of a bulkier individual. The word iron clad is no longer a far cry for the growing man.<br />
<br />
As they solidified, his khakis simply recognized the muscle mass, and the necessity to shave at certain areas. As they developed a much preppy, fashionable yet large material to support his grown waist. Stretching widely , accommodating to the model as his darkened buns gets cupped with a legendary jockstrap that has been awarded to the finalists of a modelling competition.<br />
<br />
As Ray stood up, he could feel his crotch straining against his newly grey metallic dress shorts, the gayness of his cock being magnetically attracted to the heterosexual... very hetero attire that he is developing, straining harder and harder as a black belt buckle looped itself around the XL waist.<br />
<br />
And Ray is still focused on his brother. <br />
<br />
Feet moving slowly on its own...the climbers climbed upwards his lean chest and back. Sure they were good but for this man...only perfection will do. As the erection forced Ray to walk with an even more swaggering gait than his bro, his body certainly lived up to its standards.<br />
<br />
Modelling his abdominals and pectorals with that mixed blood coating, chiseling even more crunches and workouts in as the striker was far too bully to be one. Instead, like the Riches and coloration in his blood, he most certainly practiced rock climbing...something he loved as it gave him raw, applicable muscle that men could not gain just by lifting weights in the gym. <br />
<br />
Thanks to his old man for introducing to rock climbing to him of course.<br />
<br />
Ray however, was too focused in walking front to where his brah was standing. New knowledge and information filled his head of a father whose voice is increasingly getting more familiar...as a solid eight pack layered his strong core, as two basketball sized pecs pressed outward against his buttoned down on this bodybuilder. Layered on top were slight curls of hair, dusted and trimmed to prevent untamed sparseness...he indeed a celebrity-<br />
<br />
‘Celebrity?’<br />
<br />
But that did not take the cake, as his wings (back muscles) began to spread far and wide, like someone defending a wide area...more so than defenders of basketball and football-although he did try them. The coloration now swiftly sculpted a strong intimidating structure from behind, as those shoulders get hardened like a roman stature. Like a greek god, his button down snapped open to reveal the hardcore goalie of Man Alpha Nu. <br />
<br />
Fit for defending and clutch saves, as his arms stretched far and wide almost like reaching out to his...brah. Yeah man...why was he hogging all the spotlight? His broad shoulders made mountains out of his biceps, solidifying into a round gigantic hill of muscle as the Goalie was certainly the huger of the two.<br />
<br />
As veins line themselves nicely, coats of hair layered on his Japanese, Indian Caribbean platter. Like the icing on the cake, as his  copycat buttoned down gets BURSTED OPEN, briefly revealing his irresistible physique before the remains of the clothes gets meshed into tan cotton, the row of buttons turning into a darker ‘plastic’ as only a couple remained above his breast. A couple of firm metallic stripes filled the new XL polo tee which framed his sweet bod, as a couple of dark shades hung at the top of his unbuttoned polo tee,  slight curls of hair can be seen on the manly grope-able figure.<br />
<br />
His hands are nearly there, time is ticking down...as his right wrist now sports an expensive mahogany gold watch which ticked, every second in the livestream matters-especially his reputation with his fans...and his bro. The caramel broadened into wider grip, with fingers stretchin’ till they can just reach the soccer ball...<br />
<br />
His meaty, ‘sugar daddy’ palms gave a tight manly grip over at the co-host. His neck rumbling like spicy curry, one mixed from Japanese and Indian descent.<br />
<br />
“Ay brah...” The man rumbled “Forgettin’ bout me?”<br />
<br />
An incredibly sexy sultry accent...not Sikh Punjabi, echoed out of the male. But one that respected its roots and ancestors while blending in with modern English. <br />
<br />
‘Heh...ladies do say I look good in a turban’<br />
<br />
This originated from his thick neck, Sake and Beer running through his veins as it BURPED out a nice deep Adam’s Apple. Voice box ringing in Ray’s ears...maybe he finally WOKE and realized the changes. But it was far too late, as the Jap-Indian Caribbean planned to get the job done. Professionally and swiftly like his mother’s side of the family.<br />
<br />
With the almost completed hunk almost completely ‘sober’. New comments came flooding in the chat, likes moths to the flame. The curse brought a couple of...lewd spectators amidst the heterosexual crowd. <br />
<br />

<br />
“FUCK OFF!” Raiden shouted at the live cam. “And wow DUDE! What the FUCK were you doing? JACKING OFF?!”<br />
<br />
Jacking off...the word that set his loins on fire, like a purification. He glanced at the asian male to his side, the thought of kissing Raiden gave an overwhelming spiciness seemed like pent up arousal...but is in reality kimchi.<br />
<br />
And Raiden’s ‘Kimchi’ kills off any gayness left.<br />
<br />
‘Do it you faggot...kiss your bro, I fuckin’ dare you fag...and see what happens.’<br />
<br />
Ray was used to this kind of talk, his bros in business always made remarks like no other and he joined in them. But he never really meant it for real previously...or, perhaps he did? <br />
<br />
He groaned deep, deeper than ‘usual’ as the 6ft 4 Soccer brah starred down his the team’s star striker. Memories of the new field, Hi-fives, and open showers together filled the remains of Ray’s mind, and he knew what he had to do, and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
TACKLE!<br />
<br />
The livestream gets distorted briefly, as for the current reality, it is expected for the hulked up ‘Ray’ to be kissing his older brother Raiden. But the curse would not allow that, as events shifted into something more appropriate for the childhood best brahs. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
A gay guy lunged at ‘Ray’ at the night bar, a drunken haze overwhelmed the Mixed blood celebrity...but there was a certain flare to it that WOKE ‘him’ up.<br />
<br />
Wait...he lunged? Wasn’t it the other way around? And wasn’t it with Rai...<br />
<br />
“DA FUCK?”<br />
<br />
He heard the sound of a very loud hollering jock yelling in the background...and unpleasant homosexual trying to press lips on him with his body being under...and reacted uncomfortably to the assault.<br />
<br />
‘Thought you wanted to kiss your brah?’<br />
<br />
“Fuck No..” ‘Ray’ could barely force that out, his buttocks clenched in agony as he feared for the worst, his member finally taking on that light caramel hue...accepting his true sexuality, as well as a chance the fight back<br />
<br />
He was far stronger than that. Member rose to the occasion, rushing heaps of testosterone over on this playboy, mind coping with kneads and sensations from gorgeous women, elongating and swelling his balls as dark curls framed his throbbing inches, girthed like a sword, he had the riches of a pirate after all.<br />
<br />
As the hetero embracing male pushed back, ‘ladies’ gave pecks of encouragement to his cheeks as they rose to an alcoholic blush. Gentle caresses over on his chin were rubbed without disappointment, as they chiseled out an alpha squared jaw in place.<br />
<br />
Yeah...he was no beta! Look at all the ladies he’d scored. The former Ray barely even tried when girls flocked over to him...Ramesh simply took that feature and made it ten times better. They STAY with em’, as they gave kisses over and over, facial hair grown briefly before being shaved, hair being styled into a short faux hawk esque hybrid with curls like the nobility in his family. <br />
<br />
Priding on it as he remembered styling and gelling it always-with a couple of lucky babes doing it for him. What can he say? Chicks loved every part bout’ him. His eyebrows furrowed as stylish thick, beetle-back brows graced his incoming vision. The salted caramel tone overtook his entire...gorgeous face, a prominent nose of his scented something...really ‘not hetero’ to put it plainly...<br />
<br />
KISS!<br />
<br />
His lips thickened as a form of defense, as his teeth formed a perfect white shield that blocked the incoming attack from the enemy. Like a knight...he must not allow the enemy to come in, civilian taste buds from Japan, India and the Caribbean were counting on him to stay straight. Like a Pirate, his lips developed out due to his heritage, for lassies to enjoy and to protect from scallawags to enter in. The actor had to keep his cool, but as the kimichi was piping hot bellow. He could not stand it any longer.<br />
<br />
HE WAS AN ALPHA!<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Letting loose of the former gay tension, Ramesh BURSTED out with a SPAT! Both from his throbbing member and from his mouth as they expelled the gayness within. Eyes opening into a darker caramel than his skin, as it revealed a form of royalty due to his mixed ethnicity. Slightly larger eyes with epicanthic folds being less full.<br />
<br />
What was he thinkin’! This gay guy trying to fuck with his acting career over with a scandal! What would his followers say about dis? ...Wait? Isn’t this guy...<br />
<br />
SPAT!<br />
<br />
The new heterosexual leaped backwards, as his brah Raiden...although not as angry as he would have been...angrily got up as well. Fury in his eyes...despite the both of them ‘planning it’.<br />
<br />
In an effort to lure homosexuals to the livestream, the RREALBRAHS planned to do a ‘PRANK’ vid in order to psyche the faggots out of their boners.<br />
<br />
As the livestream stabilized itself once more, the previous footage has now been set in stone into sloppy ‘gay banter’ between Ramesh and his soul bro. Obscured by the angle, the footage shows the Soccer Goalie tackling the striker onto the bed, with ‘fake kissing sounds’ proceeded with rude spats at the other as though they kissed.<br />
<br />
But Ramesh did not even put his lips onto his childhood friend and gaming/soccer bud. After all, one drunken night was bad enough...never when he is sober.<br />
<br />
‘What a fuckin’ gay memory...’<br />
<br />

<br />
“FUCK OFF HAHAHA!” Ramesh and Raiden gave the middle finger simultaneously at the livestream feed. “YOU THINK WHAT? WE GONNA KISS? YOU GUYS GAY IS IT?”<br />
<br />
The two of them said in unison, in in their various accents. Yet their loud boisterous tones blended in nicely with one another, representing co-owners instead of an alpha and a beta.<br />
<br />
No longer was the Multi Racial Male the beta of the two, they were both alphas in their joined youtube channel- RRealBrahs. With their initials being RR, and well DUH! They were Brahs from Mu Alpha Nu!<br />
<br />
As they shit talked for the rest of the afternoon till evening. Unknowingly converting homos into their new heterosexual subs as their feed and channel keeps growing and growing past the size they ‘originally’ had.<br />
<br />
———————Livestream end———————<br />
<br />
“Man...that was fucking gay...but we got a shit ton of cash and subs out of it...WOOT!”<br />
“Definitely not, you ‘kiss’ like a faggot”<br />
“Eh, Fuck you-!”<br />
<br />
The two of them roughhoused for another couple of minutes. Ramesh and Raiden were the best shits this university has got, sure there were the likes of DariusShooter, but the dude was more of sexual juggernaut than ‘skill’. Man! All of them raked up the views like a storm though! <br />
<br />
Hot heterosexual men... exactly what the ladies want...<br />
<br />
“Gonna hit the showers bro, keep the fort straight an’ running...”<br />
“Course man...wouldn’t want some homo ’cummin’ over”<br />
<br />
Once again, Ramesh stayed over at Raiden’s dorm for the night, sleeping over at next door room which was non-occupied...for now. Though it oughta be his considering he has been coming over more often than not... but who knows?<br />
<br />
(With the curse going about maybe it actually belonged to someone?)<br />
<br />
He was grateful that he could at least chill over with his soul bro for a couple of nights,<br />
in this pride infested campus, at least he had his bro reminding em’ to stay straight.<br />
<br />
RING RING RING!<br />
‘Dad.’<br />
<br />
Ramesh Riches answered the call on his branded Cisdroid Rush, as a familiar fatherly, yet paranoid ‘pirate’ tone, resonated through his black studded, fame-embracing ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, your Aunt Priscilla is throwing around those old rumours of you being gay...&quot;<br />
&quot;Pay it no mind, Dad. She&#39;s just trying to get Mom riled up. Y&#39;know how they are...&quot;<br />
<br />
His father, Dr. Mark Riches, paused...briefly, almost in doubt of his son’s sexuality.<br />
<br />
The two of them always had calls over this, ever since a certain bastard had leaked out the info that a guy had attempted to make out with him at a bar. Fucker Joel got him so drunk on that day that he couldn’t fight back...but man! <br />
<br />
Serves him right for thinkin’ he was ever gay! He hated it, but that disgusting slop of a kiss on that horrible night reminded him of that he could never was gay or bi, even his bro Raiden could ‘kiss’ better than a fucking homo...I mean...they did not kiss but IT STILL WAS GAY AS FUCK! Whoever asked for that during the livestream was a FUCKING FAG!<br />
<br />
‘Ain’t no way am I doing that OR ANYTHING remotely gay-suggestive again...I have a reputation to maintain and besides...these lips are a Bollywood special, reserved for ladies only...’<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Cousin Joel had braincells in his jock brain to bring him his own harem the night after... otherwise Aunt Priscilla’s gonna know how much of a ‘good boy’ he really was. But damn, was he REWARDED BIG TIME! Erika Erotica and her sexy crew, the gay kiss was awful but these the ladies...were as spicy and tasty as the finest curry...<br />
<br />
Maybe cause he knew now that he was 100% straight...or maybe...some of the women who made out with him lately were actually dykes?<br />
<br />
Speaking of which-<br />
<br />
“Dad, I have many women going after me as a celebrity? Even lesbians! Isn’t that a good thing...unlike Uncle Percival’s suggestion in being around sweaty men in the army?! Are you trying to turn me gay?”<br />
<br />
“No-No Son! I mean I’ve been researching on how to turn gays straight! What kind of JOKE would that be!”<br />
<br />
Ramesh scoffed, rolled his eyes as his father spoke once more.<br />
<br />
“Ah...guess I never thought about it that way...Sorry son...just that your mom is really upset.”<br />
“She’s always upset...”<br />
“Except in the bed...”<br />
“Too much info dad...”<br />
&quot;By the way, are you seeing anyone? One of the other professor&#39;s has a cute daughter...&quot;<br />
&quot;Daaaad....&quot;<br />
<br />
Ramesh whined childishly in his deep groan, as he chatted with his old pop. Both of them shared a strong father and son relationship together, epitomes of royal masculinity as he was every inch his dad’s son. <br />
<br />
Aside from his dad’s cravings for a strong matriarch... his slightly lighter and more aristocratic skin tone, and the fact that this genius 4.0 GPA student is also a well-known film actor/celebrity across campus to Hollywood...and even worldwide if Ramesh played his cards right.<br />
<br />
