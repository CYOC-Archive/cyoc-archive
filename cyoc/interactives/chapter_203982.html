<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Based on this original chapter: /interactives/chapter_162432.html</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So...you guys can switch me with another body and I wouldn&#39;t have to be a kid anymore? I&#39;ve been a kid longer than anyone alive do you realize that? I can&#39;t take it anymore,&quot; you blurt out. Brad&#39;s face is unreadable. You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s guilt, anger, annoyance, shame, or all of the above.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not our only subjects, Brad.&quot; The professor hissed at you as your visibly irritated. You don&#39;t want to be called Brad anymore, you bitterly thought. &quot;We&#39;ve been monitoring a number of successful body swaps. But a full consciousness download, which is what this is, is new territory. You two are pioneers. We really do respect you both for what you&#39;ve done. One day, we&#39;ll be able to go public with this. But for now, we still need to monitor your brainwaves during a number of activities and that’s going to be unpleasant for you. So we thought we&#39;d get it out of the way. We have monitoring equipment and we can give you some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m sorry, Brad.&quot; Brad&#39;s voice is so deep and hoarse. The audacity of Brad to call you by your new name and not your old one in front of the adults. You realize how much your body has changed. You were just on the cusp of real maturity when Brad got to take your body and live his adult life with it.<br />
<br />
His body just absolutely dwarfs your own. Your body<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you talking about-&quot; you say, stopping yourself. You want to ask if he&#39;s sorry he took your body, your life. He said he didn&#39;t realize what he was taking from you. Did he realize how much you hated all of these people for what they did to you? For how they took advantage of your parents in order to get what they wanted?<br />
<br />
&quot;I just...I don&#39;t want you to be embarrassed, that&#39;s all.&quot; He says it in a low voice, grumbly and coarse. Your old body has matured with such a sexy baritone. The body you grew up in all over again, Brad&#39;s body, is nowhere near as built and seductive. You don&#39;t have half the confidence you did in your old body growing up. It&#39;s been an issue for you for years as you slowly realized that you were never going to have the genetic potential you did the first time around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...is that a yes?&quot; the doctor asks carefully. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll do it. Let&#39;s get it over with,&quot; you say. &quot;We&#39;ll be in observation. You two boys have fun, okay?&quot; The doctor leaves. You stare at Brad. The new David. His body bulges everywhere with years of hard earned muscle, bulging every seem of his clothing. You gape at the size of his arms. His arms are bigger than your head. You had no idea your body had such genetic potential and Brad was the one that got to reap the reward of that genetic potential...not you. His beard...he has a beard now! You can&#39;t grow any facial hair at all yet. <br />
<br />
You touch your 5 inch penis. Brad is seemingly looking down on you as he begins to touch his solid girthy cock. It sprouted from his body at full mast. His chest hair was just thick enough to give him an incredibly manly aura. He was in your body and he had turned it into the body of a muscle stud. He didn&#39;t just let it go to waste and you think in the back of your mind, you probably would have.<br />
<br />
You finally get your slim dick hard finally and began stroking it. Brad is stroking his gently. It&#39;s a solid 8 inch tube and thick...at least 6 or even 7 inches in girth. He&#39;s looking down on you and getting aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so much bigger than you now. It&#39;s so weird to see my old body at 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re huge. I wish I was huge. You&#39;re so huge...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you...do you like looking at my body?&quot; He is stunned. You burn with shame as you turn away from him. Before you know what&#39;s happening his big meaty hands are on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t care. Most people have this reaction to me now. I began this journey by wanting to be bigger than everyone. It was just...inside of me, that desire. I like it when women look at me. I like it when men look at me. With lust. I like that they want me. I like that you look at me that way,&quot; He whispers the last part. You can feel his massive cock slide against your bare buttock. You can&#39;t believe this is the same body you used to have. It looks twice as big as you ever were. You begin to cry. He bends down and puts a comforting arm around you, turns your chin to look into his masculine, almost fatherly type face. He looks like a woodsman, a fitness instructor, a superbly heroic man. Beyond clichely masculine. His pecs dance a little bit as he flexes them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck these people. Let&#39;s give them a real show. What do you say? You can tell me anything and I&#39;ll be fine with it.” Brad giggles. &quot;I like looking at your body,&quot; you admit fearfully. &quot;That&#39;s okay. I want you to.&quot; He steps back, his cock wobbling there in front of you. &quot;Show me how turned on you are, man. Show me how fucking hot you think I am. I think you&#39;re really fucking hot.” &quot;You&#39;re my brother. This is so wrong.” You say begrudgingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not. They fucked us both up. I stayed away for years because I was afraid of hurting you. Now let&#39;s do this without shame. Show me your dick, dude. Yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s hot.&quot; Brad starts jerking his manly cock. He can&#39;t get his hand entirely around it, it&#39;s a little too thick. You are mesmerized and you start jerking yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. Fuck yeah.&quot; He&#39;s slamming his dick now, and rocking back and forth, standing there, a raven haired god looming over you. His pecs shine in the white light of the lab, on the white floor. His body is perfect. You only come up to his pecs. You want to know what it&#39;s like to make love to your own body and suck your old dick...<br />
<br />
You start to spasm. You&#39;re in heaven looking at Brad&#39;s perfect muscles as they wobble back and forth as he jerks off. His face is scrunched up more now. He&#39;s really getting into it. He&#39;s grunting and grunting. You feel like collapsing. Your penis is so sensitive and you&#39;re around a muscular man for the first time. You both begin to yelp…well Brad is growling and shouting. He sounds like a real man.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAAAAH!&quot; he screams. &quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! CUM WITH ME, DAVID!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; You collapse on your knees rubbing your little dick, and it feels so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; Brad roars, and you feel his cum splash all over you. Over your neck and chest. Rope after rope follows. &quot;AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; It flies in your face more and it covers your chest. He&#39;s...aiming it at you, you realize. You open your mouth to catch some and a little bit sprays in. You taste your old bodies cum for the first time and it makes you shiver and your dick hardens again long enough for you to whimper as it spasms out a few bits of cum.<br />
<br />
The scientists come in and take all the samples. They wipe Brad&#39;s cum off of you and help you up as they bring you to a shower. You barely register what happened, and before you know it, you&#39;re dressed again and following your new big brother out to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re in the car with Brad, who is in the driver&#39;s seat of course. He&#39;s an experienced driver now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...thank you. For everything.&quot; He puts his big meaty paw on top of your hand and gives it a squeeze. &quot;You&#39;ve given me the most amazing life and I stayed away because I didn&#39;t want to hurt you and now I regret that. I should have been around. I should have taken on the role of big brother instead of running away from all of my guilt.&quot; He starts his pick up truck. His T-shirt hugs his big pecs and they jut out, nipples visibly hard. You try to speak but you can&#39;t, so you look out the window. Brad drives through a rural area and turns a few times so that you wonder where you are now. He stops in the middle of nowhere, bordering a large green farm with no one in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a smoke,&quot; he tells you. He gets out of the car and walks a little while, lights up a blunt and blows smoke, and you can tell he&#39;s very used to the action. &quot;When did you start smoking?&quot; you ask him, after you get out onto the dusty roadside. &quot;College. I waited until Mom and Dad weren&#39;t around. Then I had a lot of fun. I had a LOT of fun. I had a ton of sex in college. I worked out like crazy, worked so hard to get my business degree, and I just...enjoy smoking. Don&#39;t tell Mom or Dad...okay?&quot; He looks at you, a little afraid of your parents finding out. He blows smoke. &quot;I won&#39;t tell. I actually...I was always fascinated by weed. I really wanted to start taking edibles. I was planning to when I moved away to college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit,&quot; Brad says, taking a drag. &quot;I&#39;m gay,&quot; you tell him. &quot;And you&#39;re bi.” &quot;Yeah. Yup. I&#39;m actually...seeing someone. Who is a man. I uh...haven&#39;t told Mom and Dad yet. I just couldn&#39;t. I think they&#39;d be pretty shocked.” Brad said. ”Yeah, well you&#39;re only 18, technically. You&#39;re a 18 year old giant with a beard who smokes weed and fucks. You&#39;re living the dream, Brad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m living your dream. Hey uh...there&#39;s something I need to tell you. I&#39;m...really uncomfortable with you calling me Brad. I haven&#39;t been Brad since I was 4. Everyone calls me David now. I would really appreciate it if we could just go by our new names. You be Brad and I be David. It&#39;s just easier. I&#39;ve been David for like 9 years now.&quot; He stubs out his blunt with his boot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about um...there&#39;s some other stuff we should work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We will.&quot; You tell him. You walk over and put your much smaller hand in his big meaty paw. &quot;I&#39;d like my big brother back.” The new David caresses your cheek and bends down. His behemoth of a body is so much bigger than yours that it makes it easy for him to pull you into a big muscle bear hug.<br />
<br />
David, your new brother, who has taken your name, drives you into town. You wonder if you&#39;ll find yourself in a new body soon. You wonder if that body will be gay or straight, and how jarring it will be to be in a new body all over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should probably get some mints.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stop at a drugstore. It really is amazing. You have to keep up with your big brother. He has such big, powerful legs and he doesn&#39;t even seem to notice that he should slow down for you and you&#39;re too proud to say anything. &quot;David&quot;...it&#39;s going to be difficult to think of him as David, he gets some mints and also some bottles of beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, please don&#39;t tell our parents I&#39;m buying alcohol in front of you,&quot; he says, stowing it in the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really afraid to let Mom and Dad know you smoke, drink and fuck guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know. They&#39;re Mom and Dad so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Can we go somewhere and drink some beer together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Because you&#39;re still a minor. Those are...for me and my buds. I&#39;m meeting some old friends from undergrad.&quot; That&#39;s right. When Brad swapped bodies with you he went from elementary to college and had to work hard to get all caught up. It was a miracle he graduated on time. He was somehow able to adapt very quickly and absorb a huge amount of information. It still boggled your mind how much he must have absorbed in the transfer and you suspect he was able to do more than they thought he would be able to do. It suddenly makes you angry. How you missed out on everything. College. Gyms. Sex. A job. A new life. You were getting humiliated on a daily basis still going to school with children. You had had a second childhood and it was boring and often terribly socially awkward. You were frustrated with your new life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. Mom and Dad don&#39;t need to know you gave me a beer. We can just hang out with your friends and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! When I say no I mean NO, Brad. Yes, I&#39;m calling you BRAD. You&#39;re the child in this family still. And I&#39;m having a weird ass day so don&#39;t push me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You simmer. You know it&#39;s unreasonable. You just have so much frustration over your entire life being hijacked.<br />
<br />
“Look, we need to have a talk,&quot; your new big brother says. &quot;I know you don’t want to hear this but…I’m the one with adult experience. I’ve been an adult for a while now. I’m 30. I started this journey when I was 8, became 20 and have been living on my own since. That took a lot of adjusting and it was a lot more pressure than I thought it was going to be. But it made me who I am today.<br />
<br />
I know it may hurt, but…you have to let me be in charge when we’re out in public. I’m your big brother now. I have adult experience and you have hardly ever been an adult. So you need to understand that I know what’s best for you, at least for the time being. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; You sulk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you? Do you understand that I love you, Brad? I feel bad but I also...I love this body. I love it. And I&#39;ve really lived it. I took advantage of being big and strong. I did construction for a while. I now work for a factory as a mid level manager. I love MY life. I love having sex. I love having big muscles. But I&#39;m not going to give you what you want just because I feel some guilt. In fact, fuck it. Fuck feeling guilty. I&#39;m glad I took your body! I’m glad I&#39;m not a boy. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m a man! I had the desire and I went for it. And you agreed to the swap. Did you ever think about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I regretted it ever since.&quot; Without warning, your new big brother lifts you up to his eye level with ease. &quot;One day you&#39;re gonna be just as tall as me and we are gonna have some real fun. I promise you. This is the craziest day and we both need to calm down. Do you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you admit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Brad. I mean...David.&quot;<br />
<br />
He kisses you gently on the forehead, his furry beard bristling against your teenage skin.<br />
<br />
He flexes while he carries you, showing off. “I am so glad we’re okay again, Ifeel so fucking good, dude! Come on. Hop in, I&#39;m taking you home and then I&#39;m going to hang out with my friends. And then when I get back home after drinking, I&#39;m probably going to be really fucking horny. And since it&#39;s not a school night, I suggest you wait up for me. Can you do that...Brad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;d do anything for you...David.&quot;</p>
