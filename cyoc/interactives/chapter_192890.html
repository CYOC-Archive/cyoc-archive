<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick balked at the rows and rows dildos, plugs, and vibrators of all shapes and sizes. He didn’t know what he was doing here; he felt awkward and out of place. He’d only come out gay a few months ago, mostly to his closer friends and his more supportive family members. Almost immediately he’d met Anthony, a handsome man who left had left him his phone number and a fat tip when he came into the little bar that Patrick worked at downtown. Anthony had been a passionate man, but his powerful sex-drive and seemingly endless list of kinks and desires had left Patrick feeling intimidated. He was still a virgin, he remembered with a pang of shame, He’d only put Anthony off a few times, but the man had gotten tired of Patrick’s hesitation and walked out on him after only a month. “You’re just so vanilla, man. You gotta flesh out your interests.”, he’d said, in their last conversation before he left. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d been mentally preparing himself for some time, and now had finally summoned the courage to go into the shabby little sex shop he’d always passed on his way to work. He didn’t know it was basically just a dildo depot. He casually walked along the aisles, chuckling at the descriptions of some of the products, but gasping at some of the prices. <br />
<br />
“Is there anything specific you’re looking for?” the shopkeeper asked in a cheerful tone, not turning away from her work. <br />
<br />
“Um, kind of, I guess. Never really used a dildo before,” he confessed, the word still feeling funny on his tongue.<br />
<br />
At that, the shopkeeper turned around and gave him a smile that Patrick could almost describe as wicked. “A first timer? Excellent, I think I may have just the right man for you,” <br />
<br />
“Man?” Patrick, as he followed her down the aisles to the other end of the store, where there was a long, illuminated display case. Inside where several dozen dildos, all made of what appeared to be silicone colored to resemble various skin tones. Patrick was surprised at the detail, each one of them different from the next. They even each had their own pair of silicone balls, as well as a suction cup, Patrick noted.<br />
<br />
“These,” began the shopkeeper, gesturing with a flourish, “are my…custom models, based of real-life celebrities, actors, pornstars, models, and the like. Before you ask, No, we do not disclose the donor behind any of the models, for reasons of anonymity. But I do love giving hints!” she supplied at the end of her introduction with a giggle. <br />
<br />
“They’re really big,” Patrick commented, looking at one in particular that had to be at least twelve inches. “I’m kind of looking for, like, an entry-level dildo?” he said, with a shaky laugh.<br />
<br />
“Not to worry, not all of them are as intimidating as they look. In fact, I’m thinking of one now that would be a perfect fit, if you’ll excuse my tongue-in-cheek.” She giggled again, before stooping down to unlock the display case. Instead of a regular pair of carbon-copy keys, she pulled out a more slender and old-fashioned-looking key from her pocket to unlock the glass doors. She reached into the far back and plucked a large, slightly swarthy looking dildo from off of a little velvet pillow. She stood up and turned around, holding the girthy thing in both her hands. <br />
<br />
“This one is one of my personal favorites. A prolific gay porn star, but his films are satisfying for all audiences, if I must say,” she said, giving Patrick a wink. She presented the dildo to Patrick, he reached out and closed his fingers around the shaft. <br />
<br />
He was shocked at how life-like it felt; the veins, the firm-yet-supple hardness of erection. The balls were large and round, even in proportion to the size of the shaft itself. He’d thought Anthony’s cock was big, but Patrick could tell even with his limited experience that this thing out-sized Anthony by more than an inch.<br />
<br />
“Wow, it feels so real,” he said. “How big is it?”<br />
<br />
“Nine inches. Well, eight inches insertable, and six inches in circumference. The balls and the suction cup add a few inches, I’ll admit. Although you’ll find the suction-cup to be quite handy.”<br />
<br />
“And, how much is it?”<br />
<br />
She grinned. “Normally custom models like this cost quite a lot; my suppliers don’t get very many…commissions, you could say. But I’ve had Bud here for a long time, and he could use a good home. So lets call it, one hundred dollars?”<br />
<br />
“A hundred bucks? For a dildo?” Patrick exclaimed. He didn’t even drop money like that on his car. <br />
<br />
She shrugged. “Can you really put a price on healthy and enjoyable anal stimulation? Of course, if you’re worried about money, I’m sure the grocery store down the store could find you a nice cucumber for market price.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m a waiter on an unstable income.” Patrick retorted, with some bite.<br />
<br />
“Well, since you’re a first-time customer, I can throw in a ten-percent discount for your next purchase. And of course I always provide a free bottle of personal lubricant with my custom models.”<br />
<br />
Patrick examined the veiny dildo in his hands, thinking for a moment. ‘You’re just so vanilla,’ he remembered Anthony saying. “You know what, fuck it. I’m buying a dildo today. Please, and thank you.”<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper clapped her hands together. “Excellent! I’ll meet you at the register.” She snatched the dildo from Patrick’s hands and disappeared into the back room. Patrick sighed and pulled out his wallet as he returned to the front of the store and waited by the cash register. A few minutes later the woman returned with an unmarked package about the size of a shoe box.<br />
<br />
“Alright. So, this is everything you will need,” she said, tapping the box with slender fingers. Patrick noticed her fuchsia-colored nails were tapered sharp. “Bud, of course, as well as a bottle of our special house lubricant and an attractive drawstring bag,” she said with a cheerful smile before her face suddenly switched to serious. “Now, its especially important that you use the lubricant we have provided for you, not one you may have purchased from elsewhere. These custom models are made out of a special kind of material that will…degrade in the presence of other lubricants. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, I guess,” Patrick replied.<br />
<br />
“Good. There’s also a letter in here, explaining some things. It may seem confusing when you first read it, but it will make more sense once you and Bud here have gone a few rounds. Now, that’ll be one-hundred dollars even. We’ll cover the tax, but just this once,” she winked at him.<br />
<br />
Patrick pulled out his debit card and paid. The shopkeeper handed him his receipt and put his new toy in a plain paper bag for him.<br />
<br />
“Thank so much for patronage, I really do appreciate it!” she said as Patrick turned around to open the door. “Oh, and Patrick?”<br />
<br />
He turned around with a start. “Uh, yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Tell your friends,” she sang.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing. Um, and what was your name?”<br />
<br />
“Ilene. You take care now, hun.”<br />
<br />
Patrick stepped outside and quickly made his way back to his apartment. It wasn’t a very long walk a small town like this. He took an unusual route back home, cutting through alleyways and across fields, all the while holding the little brown bag tucked under his jacket like he was smuggling a pound of coke. In a short while, he was approaching his quaint apartment complex, a cluster of four units, all side by side. It wasn’t the best place, but Patrick liked that the units had their own little backyards. Also, gas and electricity was covered by the rent, and it gets cold out in the pacific northwest. Patrick unlocked the front door and stepped into his dark apartment.<br />
<br />
He left his coat on a hook by the door and went straight to his bedroom. Patrick hit the light and deposited his new toy on the bed, along with the contents of his pants before shucking them off. He sat down on the bed and pulled up the brown package, opening the lid to find the dildo resting in a nest of purple tissue paper. It was accompanied by a fancy little glass bottle, and a note, as promised by the shopkeeper. Patrick picked up the note and set the box down. It read, <br />
<br />
“Thank you, Patrick for your purchase! Remember, use only the lube provided, and stop by the shop anytime should you need a fresh supply, or have an interest in anything else! Cheers!”<br />
<br />
Patrick frowned. “It looks like it was printed,” he said aloud, running his fingers over the ink. “How did she get my name on there?” he didn’t remember telling her his name in the shop either. Patrick shrugged; his name was on his ID when she verified his card, he supposed. He looked back to the dildo, feeling slightly embarrassed at himself for a moment as he looked at the fleshy toy resting in the box. He giggled despite himself, but then stopped and took a breath. <br />
<br />
“People have dildos,” he said aloud, again, “It’s a thing, Patrick. Get over it.” Don’t be so vanilla, he almost said. “Maybe a drink will help me feel better,” he reasoned. <br />
<br />
As Patrick stood up from the bed however, the box shifted and rolled off, falling to the tile floor with a loud clatter. Patrick swore and stooped down to pick up the box; the dildo was fine, as a silicone dildo would be, but the little glass bottle of lube had shattered!<br />
<br />
“God damn it,” he said, loudly. The little bottle had been reduced to a sticky mess of silicon and glass fragments. Patrick sighed and left the room, taking the dildo with him to carefully rinse it off in the kitchen sink. He returning a moment later from his kitchen with paper towels and vinegar. He delicately swept up the glass before doing his best to scrub the lube off the tile. He gathered the debris and threw it into the trash, and then went to his nightstand where a small and neglected bottle of silicone lube lay huddled in the back corner of the drawer. Patrick looked at the little bottle, reading the ingredients and directions. Just one time couldn’t hurt, right? It wasn’t as if the thing would dissolve inside of him or something from using the wrong lubricant. He hoped. Patrick reached again for the dildo and ran his fingers along the smooth surface. It felt warm from the rinse, almost real. He could have sworn he felt it pulse. Patrick forgot the beer and his plans for the evening and decided that he was going to do this. He may have ruined the lube the shopkeeper gave him, but at least he wasn’t stuck with astroglide. <br />
<br />
Patrick shimmied out of his boxers, and his shirt for good measure, and lay back onto the bed. He must have been excited, because his average-sized cock was already growing hard. He opened up the container of lube and squirted some onto his hands, rubbing some onto his circumcised cock before stroking himself on the bed for a few minutes, trying to get himself into the mood. He figured he should be playing porn or something for this, but he honestly didn’t even know where do find any. Patrick tried to push his stray thoughts out of his mind, rolling onto his side like Anthony had taught him and reaching for the dildo. With shaking fingers he carefully lubed up the dildo, stroking and massaging the shaft from the base to the head until it was slick and frictionless. He took a breath and brought the dildo down behind him, arching a leg to open himself up. He jumped when he felt the cold, lubricated head of the dildo graze the entrance to his ass; with a firm grip of the dildo’s balls he pressed the head against his entrance, gasping when he felt it pop inside him. He braced himself for the shock of pain that he normally experienced when a cock first went inside him, but strangely he felt nothing of the sort. He pressed the dildo again, sighing as he felt another inch of the shaft slide into him; the girth was a lot. But Patrick pressed on, forcing another inch inside of him while his eyes streamed from the pressure. His heart was racing, his cock harder than ever; he realized that it was starting to feel good. He tugged back on the dildo again, noting the slight twinge of pleasure he felt from within him. Patrick took a moment to apply more lube before he took a deep breath and pressed the dildo again, this time not stopping. His eyes went wide at the sensations that were hitting him as he felt the dildo probe deeper and deeper inside him. Another inch, then another, and another, until with his fingers Patrick could tell there was only less than an inch left to go. He stopped for a moment and let out a bated breath, his ass clamping down on the girthy faux-cock. His cock was throbbing and drooling precum. He took one last breath and pressed again, releasing his breath in relief when he felt the silicone balls flush against his asshole. Finally, he relaxed his hand and took a deep breath, almost laughing at how good it felt to have this thick length inside of him. It was perfect, if only there were a man attached to it, Patrick thought, he’d be in heaven.<br />
<br />
In his reverie he didn’t hear the bed creak or feel it sink a bit as the weight on the mattress changed by a bit, or rather, a lot. He figured his mind must have been getting the better of him when he felt a pair of rough fingers gently press themselves against Patrick’s sensitive nipples. Or the ticklish itch of wiry chest hairs on the bare skin of his back. Or the feel of warm lips and sharp teeth against the tender skin of Patrick’s neck as they leaned in for a playful kiss. A hairy leg snaked itself over Patrick’s own before the dildo suddenly thrusted itself into him, eliciting a gasp from the surprised young man. He felt a big hand close over his mouth, while the other still held onto his chest, teasing his nipple.<br />
<br />
“Relax, baby. It’s all good,” a deep, husky voice whispered near his ear. Patrick whimpered into the man’s fingers as he felt a hairy crotch press itself against his naked ass. The dildo stirred within him, almost as if it were throbbing, and Patrick’s eyes went ride when he realized what was happening. <br />
<br />
“Starting to piece it together?” the voice said with a throaty chuckle; Patrick still couldn’t turn his head to see the man but he stopped trying when the man began to thrust into him with long, deep strokes. Patrick moaned and felt himself melt against something firm and warm and hairy behind him. “Not many people can take my whole length in one go. I’m proud of you,” he continued thrusting, increasing his speed. “I thought it would take you weeks to build up the courage to fit all of me inside of you.”<br />
<br />
Patrick felt the men push him onto his stomach; he gasp and gripped the sheets tight when he felt the man settle his weight upon him; he was heavy, Patrick realized. “God, it feels good to be real again.” He heard the man growl from above him as he began to eagerly drive himself into Patrick’s ass. “I’ll try and be gentle, babe, but its been a long time, no promises.”<br />
<br />
Tyler couldn’t say anything; he was too lost in his own pleasure as the mystery man began to take long, deep strokes, pulling himself out almost to the tip before driving himself back home. The man took hold of him and adjusted their position again, meneuvering Patrick’s prone form first onto his side and then upright, so that Patrick could ride him. That’s when Patrick saw the man for the first time.<br />
<br />
He was a big man, and older, perhaps in his late fifties. The top of his head was bald, but the silver hair around the sides was buzzed close. His cheeks were peppered with stubbly bristles all leading to a bushy grey goatee. His eyes were steely grey and narrowed in concentration as fucked Patrick’s ass. His chest was broad and meaty, muscled but veiled by a healthy layer of padding that gave the man a mature and powerful look. He held onto Patrick’s pelvis with big, strong hands, his hairy arms thick with muscle. The man caught Patrick staring down at him, ogling him as he did his work, and smiled a roguish smile that made Patrick’s cock grow harder than ever and his ass clamp down on the cock embedded within him. He felt a hand reach behind his head to pull him close so that the man could deliver a deep and passionate kiss, pausing his thrusts.<br />
<br />
“I’m bud,” he breathed, “we didn’t get a chance to properly meet before. And you are?”<br />
<br />
He struggled to clear his mind before replying, “Patrick,” he panted. “My name is Patrick.”<br />
<br />
“Pleasure to meet you, Patrick,” Bud said with a smile before pulling him in for another kiss. “Thank you for not using the lube,” he said, before he resumed fucking Patrick.<br />
<br />
The young man found himself moving his pelvis to meet Bud’s thrusts. The man folded his arms behind his head as Patrick, not knowing what came over him, took over and gyrated himself on Bud’s cock, smiling as the man groaned and shuddered beneath him. “Oh, baby, you’re a natural.” Bud muttered before once again forcing Patrick into his last position. Patrick sighed, not even bothering to touch his dick as he enjoyed the feeling of Bud pounding into him as hard as he could, his big balls slapping against Patrick’s ass. He felt Bud’s big hands snake on top of his own and take them in a powerful grip as he slammed himself into Patrick’s ass one last time, groaning in satisfaction as he came hard within him. Patrick could feel the cock pulse and throb as it delivered Bud’s heavy load inside of him, and it drove him over the edge as well. He came, without even touching himself once, his cock exploding into his sheets as his ass clamped down upon Bud’s spent cock. With his orgasm washing upon him, Patrick could only relax and melt against Bud’s strong chest, smiling when he felt the man’s big arms wrap around him in a protective embrace. <br />
“Thanks, babe. I needed that,” he felt Bud lean into his neck to kiss him again, and in his post-orgasmic bliss it was almost overwhelming such that he squirmed and felt Bud’s cock almost slip out of him.<br />
<br />
“Careful, babe,” he cautioned, “I’m not ready to turn back just yet…” and he gently thrust himself back into Patrick up to the hilt. Patrick wanted to ask him what that meant; he wanted to ask Bud a lot of things, like how a dildo could suddenly turn into a man. But he didn’t; he felt too good, with this man holding him, inside of him. This was what he’d always wanted with Anthony; the intimacy, the gentle domination, the cuddling afterwards. It felt so right to Patrick that he felt himself drifting off in Buds arms, feeling like he’d earned himself a catnap after the thorough fucking he’d taken so well…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
When Patrick woke up, he was alone. He rolled over in his bed, wincing when his bare back touched something sticky on the sheets. Patrick sat up abruptly, his hand brushing against something firm, and scanned the room. It was dark, the only light coming from the streetlamp outside the window, but there was no one else in the room. He stood up from the bed, still naked and wincing at the warm, slightly sore sensation coming from his ass and inner rectum. He entered the main room of his apartment cautiously; he’d left the lights on, and it was clear that the living room and bathroom were empty. Upon checking the front door, he found that it was locked, just as he’d left it. <br />
<br />
“That was one hell of a dream,” he finally said aloud, hoping nothing would pipe up to agree with him. And nothing did. Patrick walked back to his bedroom but paused when he saw an empty beer bottle on the coffee table. <br />
<br />
“Did I have a beer last night after all?” he said to himself, before shaking his head to dismiss the thought. He turned off the lights and went back to his bed, jumping when he felt his leg come down on something soft and squishy, but firm. He reached under the covers and extracted the dildo, still slick with lube and covered in fuzzies from the bedsheets. <br />
<br />
“I must have fallen asleep with it in me,” he reasoned. “That would explain that weird dream,” Patrick yawned and reached for his phone. “Shit, three in the morning! Alright, that’s enough play time,” he told himself. He wrapped the dildo in a t-shirt and stuffed it into the drawer of his nightstand. Rolling over and snuggling into the covers, he couldn’t help but enjoy the pleasantly sore feeling coming from his ass. That dildo definitely did the trick, he thought, of course now I have to change the sheets in the morning. He still couldn’t believe that dream, though; fucking himself with a dildo, that turned into a man, who fucked him unlike any man he’d ever met? Certainly that was the stuff of dreams, he laughed to himself, drifting off to sleep.</p>
