<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wham, crash goes the door as one scared Donkey jack heads for the dance floor and main street. Little care is given to those in your way as perverts and dancers get knocked to the floor. One poor bar maid went flying as you slammed out the front door and past dozens of stunned soon to be's.<br />
<br />
Down Main street you gallop your speed amazes even you! A fond look ahead offers the Ferry boat but a great number of security guards blocks any unauthorized from boarding. So, on you gallop down the street till the small sign noted, &quot;Service Vehicle Exit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bang, as your extended head pushes the chainlink fenced gate open and allows a mad Donkey to proceed. A few yells from passer's by but their calls seem to urge your escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run, run I must go home! Run, run I want to be at home!&quot; Over and over you chant these words in the weakening brain you call home. Zig and zag your hooves slip and dance on the black pavement. <br />
<br />
At last the gate gives sight to the main parking lot and a possible chance to hide from those who would have this Donkey stay.<br />
<br />
Zip, through the half open gate as your now zig and zag cars and lines of people never thinking they might end up like you. &quot;Faster, run faster, must make the main highway for home!&quot; you think as sweat pours out of this animal body.<br />
<br />
People scream as the sight of a Donkey covered in lathered sweat charges past them. You hear them but pay no mind as you need to escape and go home.<br />
<br />
The highway, you run out in front of cars and trucks as brakes screech and things bang into each other. A sudden leap for life as a sports car swerves to miss the animal in his way. One long graceful jump makes you absolutly pleased with this sound and solid new form.  <br />
<br />
Now, the woods across from the Park's entrance offers safe haven and you dash off into the brush and trees. A stop to look behind and try to capture one's fleeting breath gives note to angry voices still coming after that escaped mad Donkey, you!<br />
<br />
As you gulp a great breathe the chase continues. Pleased you have become with the agile movements this body can make. At first you gulped each breath but now they come in and out with smooth rythum. The sounds of angry men falls far back as they can not work their way about the forest floor as a spry Donkey.<br />
<br />
Now you prance along as tail whips from side to side and feelings of beastial form seem to bring a deep and wonderous calm. A good three miles from the Park brings on your first need to relieve a full bladder. Stopping, you stand and feel the building urge for release but wonder what stance would be correct. You have memories of dog lifting their hind leg to direct urine on a post but your a Donkey! It was never a thought to watch a horse do his thing, but now the need to know seem's all so urgent.<br />
<br />
At last befuddled you step a half step forward and lengthen the back and belly out as far as they can be stretched. A splied pair of hind legs offers true freedon to those large balls for swinging as the penis begins it's push forward and out to the light of day.<br />
<br />
Ears stand at alert, head held high as eye panned the area for possible capture. Sniffing, the air for any sign of trouble the rear end eases it's poise. Down, down comes your full length Donkey cock and dong. You can't believe the feeling of it's bulk weight and the building urge for release.<br />
<br />
The sound of heavy rain splattering the earth makes you twist your head and neck to look down and backwards. The sight of your massive new cock is blocked by the round belly. yet the hort yellow stream flows out the easily seen end of what you are beginning lust to use as it was created.<br />
<br />
The urge calms and a scent of your Donkey urine fills the air. Turning your bigger body the head lowers to drink in the ponderous scent of your own urine. It rushes in and fills the head with odd desires and stranger yet needs for Equine company.<br />
<br />
Now you saunter along feeling the new and deep seeded calm that being a Donkey can produce. The chant of going home is almost drained from your thoughts as scents of sweet grass and foliage makes the mouth water.<br />
<br />
It is sundown before you gain a conscience thought of what was done the entire afternoon. A belly filled now with grass, berries, and foliage from pine tress and the like make a tummy grumble.<br />
<br />
As if thinking of home was the reason for your escape the strange lusts of Donkeydom now prevail. Onward you wander till the forest gives way to open pastures and fencerows galore. Plodding along the highway you watch for cars and trucks. The ever present thought of capture is still floating in the Donkey mixed thoughts.<br />
<br />
You gaze upward and lose the balance as a try to peer at a full moon. A short time to graze and drink while standing in the roadside ditch brings on a tired feeling, you need rest!<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that!&quot; you prick up those long ears to hear a wonderful sound.<br />
<br />
Hind legs spring into action as you clim out the gully and onto the highway pavement. Now trotting along your tail swings in happy delight as ears focus on the sound that bring one's heart to flutter.<br />
<br />
Stopping at the roadside you gaze into the dark and light of the full moon. A wire fence parts you from joining a small herd of ponies. You come to the fence and standing there give greetings with as soft a bray as you could muster.<br />
<br />
Courious, the ponies come closer and soon you are nuzzeling them over the fence. A panic desire to join them rolls over you as the erection down below fills and urges the idea all the more.<br />
<br />
The sound of a vehicle coming brings back the original thought of escape and home. A small hedge offers a place to hide and folding your legs down you hide.<br />
<br />
A brown and yellow truck from Pleasure Island Amusement Park rolls to a stop. You are blinded by the spotlight which pans over the herd you just made tones of love. Three men sounding coarse of language and seemly angry they must be out this late at night tell you of what some pour girl is going through.<br />
<br />
&quot;That stupid bitch is getting her pussy spread as we speak! said the driver. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, they wouldn't do that to an employee?&quot; asked the man standing behind the flood light.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Hell you say brother? Why you remember Stan Billingsly don't you? He was one that I and you knew well to be very friendly to those who, well you know! Yup, he helped one of the sweet young girls escape Circe's Funhouse. The girl got almost out of the Park as did the Donkey today but she was caught and sent directly to the P.I.A. farm. I expect she's there yet lowering her head and accepting any big buck goat's cock up her's! grumbled the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that Stan retired and went to work elsewhere!&quot; replied the floodlight worker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, retired, yea for sure he was retired from humanity and went to work elsewhere, that's a sure thing too! Stan was sent first to the Science and Medical Research Division, when he came out he was placed at the Pork and Beef Research Instutue. I saw him loaded and being sent there! I read the manifest and saw his name and then his new title. Stan Billingsly is now a very Bovined Bull doing what comes natural. He lives and works inside the feedlot of the Beef Section. I remember his soft mooing to me as I was sure those bastards left his mind to be as human while making him live the lifestyle of a Bull.&quot; chided the man to his Brother?<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind, I think this one got away! Besides Mona' will fill the spot and be a fine mother to her many foals during the next seventeen years. If she's a good Donkey they might reprieve her and grant a higher or more sensual form. Never-the-less she's an animal now by contract and a part of the property of P.I.A.P.&quot; said the driver as the trunk turned to go back.<br />
<br />
You never were more scared of being an animal than now. The old passion to make it home and return to one's past life is even more urgent. Getting to all fours and even with those horney pony mares behind you a new start for home begins. Fifty one miles it was from home to the Park via the roadway. You consider cutting across the open range and making it home before you've been a Donkey one more day.</p>
