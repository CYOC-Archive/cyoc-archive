<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drive to the airbnb was much shorter. Literally just up the road from Studio Village, the mansion was modern and cut right into the rocky face of the mountain. An infinity pool on the deck out front gave bathers a beautiful view of the Studio Village Park below and the California coast beyond it.<br />
<br />
Asterion dropped Troy off and informed him that Sebastian would likely be delayed for the dinner meeting and would reschedule for brunch tomorrow. Troy sighed and unloaded all the bags, not trusting the Minotaur to not sabotage them. Troy realized this must be Sebastian’s second home, not some random airbnb.<br />
<br />
Were there traps here too, then? There didn’t appear to be anything out of place. Modern chrome and natural stone and local woods made up most of the materials. Troy inspected the place top to bottom, flipping on lights, opening sockets, unscrewing light-bulbs, searching for cold shivers and coppery tingles. Nada. Nothing.<br />
<br />
He did find listening devices and cameras hidden everywhere. Troy pulled them all out. Sebastian would likely be furious, but Troy planned to beat his ass and get his friends back. By the time he had finished locating and removing all the bugs (that he could sniff out), twilight had fallen.<br />
<br />
Headlights appeared on the road leading up to the house. Troy took a deep breath and prepared himself. And then he let out his breath happily when he saw who was in it.<br />
<br />
Tex pulled up in his open-topped Purarri, a handsome, twunky red-haired elf  twined around his arm. There was something different about the bull man. Troy couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Had he always worn golden caps on his horns or expensive Italian suits?<br />
<br />
Troy opened the door and let them in.<br />
<br />
“This is Troy.” The Minotaur smiled.<br />
<br />
The elf smiled and extended a hand. “I’m Ameav&#39;Vendil, but you can call me Mark.”<br />
<br />
“Hi.” Troy took his slender hand and kissed it.<br />
<br />
Mark giggled. “Why Xarxos, are all your friends so handsome and charming?”<br />
<br />
“Xarxos?” Troy frowned. “Tex, are you…okay?”<br />
<br />
“It is fine.” Xarxos waved a hoof. “I thought it was a better name for a Minotaur.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded. “He got Rusty and RK. And their Books.”<br />
<br />
“Sebastian did?” Mark raised a hand. “But I didn’t do that! I was at the sex convention for the last hour or so.”<br />
<br />
Troy stared hard at…Xarxos. “Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. This is the guy with the Book of Myth? Cute tubby bear Mark from my old office?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, um…” Mark went red. “You thought I was cute?”<br />
<br />
“You know until they mentioned your name as a possible Book owner I’d completely forgotten you existed.” Troy held up a paw, “No, don’t take offense, I’ve had reality shift on me repeatedly these last few weeks. But, yeah, kind of have a taste for bigger guys. I’m dating one.”<br />
<br />
“Sebastian took Todd. Ran security tapes and saw it.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
Troy rolled his eyes. “What? No way! Not Todd!”<br />
<br />
Mark snorted, an odd thing to hear coming from someone so handsome. Nerd habits must die hard.<br />
<br />
“So is this all yours?” Mark was wide-eyed. <br />
<br />
“Nope, I think it’s Sebastian’s.”<br />
<br />
“It’s trapped.” Mark spoke the exact words Troy had been thinking.<br />
<br />
“Show us a tour?” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Where are my manners?” Troy gestured for them to follow. “Let’s walk and talk. Want me to bring Mark up to speed then?”<br />
<br />
Xarxos nodded. Troy gave them everything he knew thus far about the contract they were under. Mark looked disgruntled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this place a trap?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I figured it out while we were talking. It’s a cave overlooking Studio Village.” Troy sighed. “Any Paradox and we get turned into another attraction or something.”<br />
<br />
“You know,” Xarxos rubbed his chin. “This contract is actually a double-edged sword.”<br />
<br />
“We’re all turning into Sebastian’s loyal employees.” Troy snorted. “I don’t see how any of this could be beneficial. I’ll never see Daryl again.”<br />
<br />
“Well, wait, hold on.” Mark said slowly. “I think I see what he means. No employees may directly steal or harm another employee. It’s obviously meant to protect him from us, but it also protects us from him. He took your Books. But he can’t actually take them. That would be stealing. His negotiations would likely involve bargaining for them in a way that gets you to give them up unwittingly.”<br />
<br />
“So what you’re saying is,” Troy paused, “We need a team of lawyers. Is there a Book for that?”<br />
<br />
Mark shrugged. “I could summon something…”<br />
<br />
“The other thing I figured out.” Xarxos continued. “Is that he is unaware that I have a Book. Based on their actions, they believe I only possess a fake Book. You are the last man to fall.”<br />
<br />
“We’re meeting tomorrow for brunch at his estate. Has he contacted you in any way?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“No. I suspect this is an easy way for him to avoid any Paradox and, essentially, win.” Xarxos said. “He WANTS Paradox to happen, Troy. All these people returning to their homes. Twatter posts. It’s going world wide. When the Auditors step in…it’s over.  You can’t put the genie back in the bottle.”<br />
<br />
“How much time do we have?”<br />
<br />
“Today is Friday. It’s a long weekend. Most people will leave Sunday. Twatter posts and pictures are one thing but actual Myths going back home?”<br />
<br />
“So we have to beat him by tomorrow.” Troy nodded to himself. “Great. Something else to stress about.”<br />
<br />
Mark sighed. “You know what? Let’s just have some fun in the pool. It’s right there.”<br />
<br />
“Cursed pool?” Troy asked Xarxos.<br />
<br />
“No magic emanates from the pool. It is filtered and an enchantment is difficult to maintain in moving water. In fact, this property has no magic present at all, save for the minor reality shifts that have crept up the driveway.”<br />
<br />
“Are they going to be a problem?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I suspect they will be. Mark and will be unaffected but you…” Xarxos trailed off. “You will be different in the morning. As will this house.”<br />
<br />
Troy pulled off his clothes to Mark whistles of appreciation. He smirked at Mark and winked. Then he pulled on his thong and walked to the pool.<br />
<br />
“It’s 90 degrees out and I’m tired.” Troy stepped gingerly into the much cooler pool. He settled himself on an underwater bench and sighed. “Water’s good.”<br />
<br />
There was a splash as the elf and Minotaur hopped in. Troy closed his eyes and started rifting off. Mark swum up to him and scratched his ear.<br />
<br />
“Troy? Don’t fall asleep in the pool. You’ll drown.” Mark said.<br />
<br />
Troy opened and eye and saw Mark staring at him with concern in his eyes. “I’m sorry. Long day. Super stressed.”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded and swam back into Xarxos arms. They cuddled at the side of the pool.<br />
<br />
“What about Rusty?” Troy asked Xarxos.<br />
<br />
“No more real than your relationship with Daryl.”  Xarxos shrugged and kissed Mark.<br />
<br />
Mark broke the kiss. “You know, you never told me how you knew I was using my spells on you.”<br />
<br />
“It’s tingles, chills running up your spine, the taste of copper flooding your mouth.” Xarxos explained.<br />
<br />
“What if my teeth tingle?” Mark smiled. “Oh no! Xarxos, dispel this magic on me!”<br />
<br />
The couple wrapped around each other and began making love. Troy rolled his eyes and looked out into the much more lively city. At best, by tomorrow they’d end up Sebastian&#39;s slaves. At worst…well, there were always loopholes. Sebastian could hire someone to assassinate him.<br />
<br />
Mark and Xarxos paused their love making, noticing Troy huddled in the water staring off into the distance.<br />
<br />
“He needs to relax.” Mark whispered.<br />
<br />
“Be smart about this. The reality shift…” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, I’ve got an idea.” Mark smiled at pointed at the preoccupied Troy. “Shift.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Troy rested his head on the side of the pool and closed his eyes. He wouldn&#39;t fall asleep, and if he did, the elf and minotaur were watching him. Just resting his eyes...<br />
<br />
A tingle in his mouth woke him. <br />
<br />
Had he dozed off? Troy yawned and rubbed his muscles and felt them…sag slightly, a layer of chub covering them. He reached out with one of his long, muscular arms to rub a pec and groaned, joints aching a bit, streaks of gray appearing in his fur. Speaking of fur, it was receding back into bare skin on his chest and face, leaving him oddly ape-like. His ears became large and pointed, lower jaw jutting, pushing up tusks. His nose remained wet and black. His features shifted, becoming more bestial.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk burped, patting the small beer belly the bugbear had grown over the years of good eating and drinking, dining at all the best restaurants. He was Xarxos’ best employee, starring in porn and advertising all his products. They called him Trogoarakk the Destroyer of Holes. Trog grinned happily, remembering all the great fucks he’d had, creasing his face with wrinkles.<br />
<br />
“Trogoarakk?” Xarxos smirked, huge equine cock erect. “Join us?”<br />
<br />
Trog eyed the enormous Minotaur and the hot elf twunk clinging to him and dove under the water.<br />
<br />
“Where’d he-oh!” Mark’s face went red as he was lifted out of the water, impaled on Trog’s thick cock.<br />
<br />
“I’m claiming your hole, boy!” Trogoarakk snarled in his pointed ear, shaking water from his eyes.<br />
<br />
Xarxos grinned. “Where do you want me, daddy?”<br />
<br />
“My ass is empty, cowboy.” Trog smirked. “Put that thick pole to work.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos circled and Trog felt a thick hoof easily slide into his well-used ass. The finger pulled out, leaving him feeling empty. Then he felt the prod of the flat head of Xarxos thick equine shaft at his entrance. With a grunt of discomfort, it entered him and lifted him and, by extension, Mark out of the water.<br />
<br />
Trog winced as he felt his back pop painfully. Damn, he didn’t want to throw it out now, in the middle of the party! Wait, party?<br />
<br />
“There, that’s it,” He grunted as he felt himself slide down the shaft, coming to a halt at the medial ring. He snarled in frustration, but his ass just wouldn&#39;t stretch.<br />
<br />
He thought he heard Mark whisper something. A shiver shot up his spine and his hole loosened, sliding down his husband’s length as a wedding band *popped* onto his finger. His nipples hardened as he stared into the eyes of Ameav&#39;Vendil. <br />
<br />
The elf smiled. “There we go. You make a hot daddy.”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk snorted, enjoying the elf’s scent. He rocked his hips in tandem with Xarxos. He was so full but the elf was super loose! <br />
<br />
“Bigger, I think. Dumber too.” The elf murmured.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk felt the elf’s slim finger poke him in his big belly and tasted copper in his mouth. His head felt like it was squeezing his brain for a moment, the pressure increasing as his  skull slowly receded, making him look more brutish. His cock swelled thicker and longer inside Ameav&#39;Vendil, filling him up.<br />
<br />
“Yer so fuckin’ hot.” Trog growled into the elf’s ear. “Makin’ me so fuckin’ horny!”<br />
<br />
His ears twitched as a few people cheered. Trog blinked and saw the whole yard was filled with people. Most of them were myths, like orcs and satyrs, though he saw a few humans as well. They weren’t alone in the pool, either, other couples and thruples fucking and sucking nearby.<br />
<br />
“Er, when…?” Trog blinked as a phone flashed in his eyes. “When did all them people get here?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Xarxos snorted. “It’s the after party for our new sex toy line&#39;s release celebration, why wouldn’t there be people?”<br />
<br />
The elf on his dick moaned. Trog stared down in a daze, hips bucking on autopilot. Mark smiled at his confusion.<br />
<br />
“Feeling better daddy?”<br />
<br />
“I think somethin’s wrong.” Trog mumbled, pistoning his cock in and out of the needy elf’s hole as he rocked back on that thick equine dick.<br />
<br />
“No, you don’t. You just want sex.” The elf said firmly.<br />
<br />
He felt the elf’s fingers brushed his back fur. He thought he’d said something, but the music that had suddenly filled the world around them blocked it out. He felt a chill shoot up his spine. Pressure filled his head, forehead sloping back some more.<br />
<br />
And suddenly, he knew the elf was right. He needed to fuck and be fucked. A wave of lust filled his dim yellow eyes and he resumed fucking with a frenzy.<br />
<br />
He slammed the twunk onto his cock over and over, drool dripping down his chin, forcing the elf into a well-lubed french kiss. The elf moaned in his mouth, staring up into Trog’s eyes and liking what little they found there. Trog felt the elf unload onto his belly but didn’t stop. He wasn’t finished yet.<br />
<br />
His husband bucked and Trog felt warmth and pressure as his belly distended, filled with the Minotaur&#39;s seed. That was finally enough to send him over the edge. He slammed the elf deep onto his cock and roared, his own dick bucking and filling him with his cum.<br />
<br />
He slid off Xarxos cock, enjoying the feeling of cum spilling out of his loose asshole, and slowly lifted the elf off him too. He floated happily on his back in the increasingly cum-filled pool, enjoying the weightlessness.<br />
<br />
Then his cock was hard again, throbbing and insistent, and he pulled himself out of the pool to find another fuck. Xarxos and Ameav&#39;Vendil were arguing over something behind him. Something about someone being too dumb.<br />
<br />
He felt another shiver and he winced as his skull grew a bit and his thoughts cleared of the strange, lust-fueled craze he&#39;d been under. What on Earth had gotten him so riled up? He needed a drink.<br />
<br />
Trog stumbled past party-goers and ended up at his refrigerator, wondering why he was there. He stood there for fifteen minutes, trying to gather his thoughts. He heard the crack of a firecracker and looked up, shook from his daze. That’s when he noticed everything was changing around him.<br />
<br />
“Oh no.” Trogoarakk whispered.<br />
<br />
All around him, the airbnb was changing, filling with personal items and affects Trogoarakk had picked up. Pictures of himself in lewd poses, paintings, statues…it was like he had stepped into an egoist’s wet dream. One of the guests bedroom expanded before his eyes, becoming a room filled with sex swings, beds, a full camera and lighting setup. <br />
<br />
That was where he filmed his best shoots, Trogoarakk idly noted. He shook his head. No! This was wrong, he was just renting it from Sebastian! But new memories were flooding his brain, shoving out all the old ones. Becoming a porn star for Xarxos, showcasing all his new toys….Trogoarakk felt his dick harden. This was the life!<br />
<br />
The rugged old bugbear shook his head, trying to hold onto his identity. He tried to make his way back to Ameav&#39;Vendi, his softened pecs and thick ass jiggling. His mind was still clouded with sex, of filling his needy hole, of a warm wet ass to ruin, of a throbbing cock to suck and luscious cum to swallow. Those thoughts crowded out all others in his mind, his dick constantly hard and leaking. Something was wrong, he wasn’t some aging porn star looking to make the jump to real movies. He was…um, something else, he was sure of it!<br />
<br />
The reality shift! It must have reached his house!<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Trogoarakk walked to a quiet corner in his mansion and dialed Daryl’s number.<br />
<br />
“Pick up! Pickup!” Trogoarakk pleaded as he listened.<br />
<br />
“Hello? Whatchu want? Do you know what time it is?” Daryl’s voice huffed.<br />
<br />
“It’s me. Trog…Troy.” He kept his voice steady.<br />
<br />
“Where are you? Man, I almost forgot about you!” Daryl’s voice rose.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, someone got me, Daryl. With a…procedure. Malleable reality. I don’t think I have long.”<br />
<br />
Troygoarakk heard Daryl sob. “The farm’s fallen’ apart! What’d they do to you?”<br />
<br />
“Listen! In the back of the house by the garden is a box. It’s got money. I wrote you a note. I used the…Special Paper, it should survive the reality shift. I wanted to tell you thank you,” Trogoarakk felt tears trickle down his face. “Everyone else forced me into a relationship against my will, but you…you nursed me back to health. I know you threw that collar out. You could have just not said anything and I’d basically be your property, but you called the police,  took me to the hospital and you held my paw all night. I could have had anyone in the world, beautiful twinks, twunks, bears. But I chose you, I found that collar and put it on for you. I know it’s stupid, we were only together for a few days, but…I loved you. That was real.”<br />
<br />
“I loved you too Troy.” Daryl’s voice was strained. “I’ll try to hold on to you for as long as I can, but you know….”<br />
<br />
“I know. If you…forget me, find a nice guy, okay? Don’t let yourself be all alone again. Good bye.”<br />
<br />
He hung up. Troy stared at the phone. So that was done. He hadn’t wanted to make the call, but…it was a good thing he had. Now to find Ameav&#39;Vendil so he can fix this before he lost himself to the change.<br />
<br />
He tried dialing Xarxos or Ameav&#39;Vendil and got no answer. They must have left their phones in their bags! This wasn’t good. He’d have to wade through the mass of people in his house, try to spot them. He went to leave, but someone stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Going somewhere Daddy?” A gravelly voice to his left said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Daddy, you’re late for our shoot.” A similar voice echoed to his right.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk’s heart pounded. Not now!<br />
<br />
Two huge, burly orcs had appeared at his side. He knew them, though he wasn’t sure how. Grogan and Tunark, two up-and-coming Orc porn-stars who just signed with Xarxos. Ex-adventurers, Grogan had wild hair and mutton chops, while Tunark was completely bald with a scar across his face. Both were thickly muscled and wore only cloth loincloths that didn’t completely conceal their big dicks.<br />
<br />
“We were looking for you at The Maze.” Grogan reached up and rolled one of Trogoarakk’s thick nips between his fingers. <br />
<br />
Trogoarakk huffed happily.<br />
<br />
“You were a no-show.” Tunark reached down and cupped Trogoarakk’s hefty balls and fondled them.<br />
<br />
“But we knew you’d be at the after party.”  Grogan pulled the Rocket Pop dildo out of his mouth, lubed with his saliva, and worked it into Trogoarakk’s loosened hole.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk groaned, licking his lips as he tasted the sweet flavor and a deeper, earthier musk.He wondered what it was. It tasted familiar.<br />
<br />
“It’s good, right?” Grogan grinned. “Had it in my ass and mouth all day.”<br />
<br />
Of course! How could he have forgotten the taste of the big orc’s meaty ass? But he couldn’t fuck them right now! Because…because he had something to do…right?<br />
<br />
“I can’t boys.” Trogoarakk panted, cock drooling. “I, I gotta-!”<br />
<br />
“Gotta?” Tunark guffawed. “Ya ain’t gotta do nothin’ but lay back and relax while the cameras roll. Come on Grogan, let’s get him to the back, he looks a little out of it.”<br />
<br />
Thick, burly green arms grabbed him on both sides and non-too-gently dragged him back through his house into the porn shooting room. He liked to call it his ‘play room’. He resisted at first, but with all the gropes and squeezes, he began walking eagerly with them.<br />
<br />
“Let’s put you in that swing.” Tunark hauled him up with surprising ease, strapping him into the sex swing. “Start the camera, Grogan.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, nice tattoo.” Grogan commented, staring at his taint. “Not really easy to imagine you reading anything other than your own autobiography.”<br />
<br />
“I read.” Trogoarakk puffed his substantial chest-not an easy thing when strapped and hanging from the ceiling-and snorted indignantly. “Idiot.”<br />
<br />
“Can we make it look like something else?” Tunark pressed on the tattoo, muttering to himself,”It’s in the perfect location for a guiche piercing. A nice, thick heavy…I don’t know, ring or whatever object would be comfortable. Would be perfect for pleasure.”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk felt a pinching sensation and then a heavy tugging at the base of his balls. He moaned as fingers tugged on it gently, putting delightful pressure on his straining cock and balls. Tunark must have found his heavy duty guiche piercing.<br />
<br />
“Oh, perfect!” Grogan smiled. “Keep tugging Tunark! You’re getting him all worked up.”<br />
<br />
Tunark stared down at the piercing in confusion. What had just happened? He squinted. Was there writing on the ring?<br />
<br />
“Bro! Play with it in your mouth!” Grogan demanded.<br />
<br />
Shrugging off the weirdness, wondering where the tattoo had gone, Tunark stuck his tongue through the ring and pulled and tugged gently. Preseed drooled onto his face. He grinned, really getting into it.<br />
<br />
“Alright, good! Now, put your finger in it and tug while kissing him!”<br />
<br />
Tunark gave the piercing a light tug and kissed the handsome old bugbear’s toothy maw, enjoying the tusk play, moaning. Trogoarakk realized that they must have done something to the Book. But he’d always had it as a piercing, right? It still worked. Probably. Tunark said there were words on it.<br />
<br />
“Goddamn, okay, I’m getting in on this.” Grogan left the camera rolling, setup the other closeup cameras, adjusted them and then walked into the back frame of the shot. “God, I’ve waited so long to have a shot at your ass, sir.”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk groaned as he felt Grogan’s meaty green girth stretch his hole, eyes rolling as it bumped and slid against his prostate the whole way in. <br />
<br />
His moans were muffled when Tunark waved his own turgid length in front of Trogoarakk’s mouth. Trogoarakk stretched and suckled the beer can-thick cock in his mouth, swallowing the sweet precum happily. He fucking lived for this!<br />
<br />
He rocked back and forth in the swing, mouth and ass squelching as the two orcs fucked him back and forth in rhythm. Trogoarakk clenched and squeezed his ass expertly, milking Grogan’s cock while twirling and suck Tunark bloated glans. His own cock dangled beneath him, stiff and drooling a steady stream onto the mat below, ignored.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, he’s just as good as they say!” Grogan puffed, sweat rolling down his dark green skin.<br />
<br />
“Gotta-” Tunark panted. “Gotta do what we agreed, though.”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk’s limited mind raced. The orcs were pulling things out the bags they’d brought with them, a strange dildo he’d never seen before. Someone else’s product. He could practically feel the tingle of magic and it wasn’t even touching him yet. Enchanted.<br />
<br />
“Sebastian said we’d get a spot in one of his movies if we shoved this in your gooch. Wanted a book too, but you only had a tattoo.” Grogan blinked. “Or was it a piercing?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, it was a book. I think it was magical. We can still get it!” Tunark pulled out of Trogoarakk’s mouth and reached for his piercing. “Really sorry about this, man.”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk was many things, including a bit dumb. But he followed rules. Rule number one, never go to the gym without lube and rule number two, never own a sex toy he couldn’t free himself from. It took him one second to wriggle his hand free and beat Tunark to his guiche piercing, pointing at the gloating orc. “Me too. Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
Tunark stiffened, mouth opened perpetually in an ‘O’ shape, his limbs disappearing, and collapsed onto the mat with a hefty thud.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Tunark, are you okay?” Grogan paused. “What’d you do?!”<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk cocked his head to look at him and shifted his finger in Grogan’s direction. “This. Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
It was now Grogan’s turn to stiffen and transform into a sex doll. <br />
<br />
Trogoarakk pointed at his sex swing, imagining it as a leather harness outfit. “Object.”<br />
<br />
He dropped to the ground with a thud. Walking over to the cameras, he erased the tapes. Then he turned back to the two dolls on the floor. Now to get rid of these feckless idiots.<br />
<br />
Xarxos and Ameav&#39;Vendil walked in on him while he was putting the finishing touches on the Orc Twin’s boxes. He was still deciding on good names for them. <br />
<br />
“Troy, are you still in there?” Xarxos asked.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk eyed them. “Not really.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we still have a meeting, but it’s about your transition-” Xarxos began.<br />
<br />
“From porn star to actual star. I know. I have my Book.” Trogoarakk snorted. “These assholes were trying to ambush me. Nice of you guys to show up late.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos looked away. “Yeah. It was, uh, quite the party.”<br />
<br />
“What’d you do to them?” Mark or whatever he was called seemed fascinated with the toys.<br />
<br />
“Book of Transmutation. Turned them into the newest product for the Xarxos doll line.” Trogoarakk shrugged. “Don’t know what they had in store for me.”<br />
<br />
“This dildo is practically glowing with enchantments.” Xarxos picked it up with a pair of tongs. “It would likely have transformed into a real cock belonging to some mythical beast. Lernean Lion, looks like. Would have transported you to the enclosure. Impregnated you. Broke your mind. Bad End.”<br />
<br />
He staggered out of the room into the hallway. The guests were gone, but the mess remained. Trogoarakk got a pack of ice-cold ale out of the fridge and sat down at his table.<br />
<br />
“Mark, next time you wanna cheer me up, don’t.” Trogoarakk glared at the red-haired elf. “You turned me into a sex-addicted porn star with arthritis.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir. I’m sorry.” Mark cringed. “Um, I’m gonna head to bed.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll fix it later.” Xarxos said, coming up behind Torg. &quot;He gets...carried away during sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah.” Trogoarakk turned and reflexively hugged his husband, kissing the Minotaur warmly on the lips. &quot;I warned you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xarxos smiled back, rocking him slowly in his embrace. Torgoarakk felt his dick bump his lover&#39;s furry abs and realised his cock was still stiff and needy. The minotaur eyed his erection with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stay up too late, big guy.&quot; Xarxos grinned and released him, wandering back to his room.<br />
<br />
Trogoarakk shuffled to his pool chair and sat down heavily, thankful to take the weight off his joints. He stared out into the city, thinking and drinking. He thought about filming something with those orc sex toys in the morning, hand idly jerking his thick cock. For now he&#39;s too tired and sore. Definitely in the morning. A quick video before he figures out a plan. That will help clear his mind. Yes...<br />
<br />
He fell asleep with the rising of the sun, snoring heavily, cock drooling on his beer belly and a pile of ale bottles at his feet.</p>
