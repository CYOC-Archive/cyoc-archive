<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What seemed to Felix to be a couple of second later, but in reality was nearly 12 hours later, he started waking up again. <br />
<br />
As he opened his eyes for the first time since being tranquilized, his eyesight was rather bleary. As he lay on his side not noticing his discomfort or even his strange new surroundings, blinking slowly, thinking he had slept in late, he was thinking of the really strange dream he had last night. What was it about? Something He couldn't remember. He only remembered he was fat and ugly, and that he was scared as hell. He also felt trapped. Terribly trapped. No matter. He slightly lifted his head in order to begin getting up, but realized he was still incredibly tired. Tired as hell! His head full of cotton, and unable to open his eyes again. So, he decided to lay his head back down for more sleep.<br />
<br />
As he did so, he heard a strange female voice from close by, which was strangely loud in his ears. In fact, his ears felt a bit funny. In any case, he heard her say: &quot;So, I see you are finally starting to come out, big guy! Got you some nice tasty oats for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lifting his head, yawning, stretching, and attempting to open his eyes a second time, he felt strange. Very strange. And confused. The reason why he was confused, is because he felt strangely stiff and constricted. Like, he couldn't seem to move his fingers, or his toes. His mouth felt huge, and full of cotton. In fact, he felt the same way he did in his dream, which was beginning to come back to him. <br />
<br />
Ignoring the strange dream in his head that was quite terrifying....what was it about? Something about turning into a donkey? He seemed to be lying on his left side, with his arms and legs sticking straight out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well,&quot; he thought, and finally opened his eyes all the way. <br />
<br />
What he saw startled him. As his heavy eyelids lifted, he thought he was seeing double. Attempting to rub his eyes with his hands, he noticed his arms did not seem to be cooperating.Becoming slightly more aware, he continued trying to reach towards his face, which seemed to be strangely stretched out further than he ever remembered. Not only did it seem to stretch out, but his entire mouth felt swollen. Especially his tongue. His throat also felt dry. Attempting to clear his throat, and saying &quot;What the...?&quot; all he could manage was a slight rumbling &quot;hawwing&quot; sound. Which, to his now-sharpened hearing, sounded frightfully familiar. <br />
<br />
Before he could try again, that female voice spoke up again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mr. Donkey! Time to get up and get your breakfast! You seemed to have had quite the adventure last night, didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night?&quot; thought Felix. &quot;And did she just call me, or someone else 'Mr. donkey?' Where am I anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind seemed to be working much slower than normal. &quot;What the hell happened last night? Did I get drunk or something? And what was that dream about again....?&quot;<br />
<br />
In any case, he wanted to try to start moving. But he seemed stuck somehow. Stuck, and quite sluggish. He couldn't reach his face with his hands to rub his bleary eyes. (He thought they were bleary, for he couldn't seem to see right. Colors seemed all washed out, and nothing seemed to have been the right size. That shovel-looking thing over there, for instance. Was that a shovel? Looks like the right shape.)<br />
<br />
The more his thoughts were circulating around his head, the clearer he felt. But why in the hell was his arms and legs so damned stiff? Why couldn't he  move his fingers? They seemed to be wrapped in something, which he couldn't seem to break them out of. <br />
<br />
Finally beginning to raise his head even higher to take a look around his new strange surroundings, he saw out of the corner of this right eye, the legs of what looked to be an equine. At least, they seemed to be the right shape, but he couldn't tell because of his new blurrier vision which he couldn't rub away. <br />
<br />
Spotting a person with their back turned across what appeared to be some sort of barn or stable that he was in for some odd reason, he attempted to say, &quot;Hey! Where am I? And who are you!?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he started to try to speak, his tongue still seemed to be made of cotton, and all he managed was a sound which literally scared the piss out of him. All he heard was the sharp reply of a jackass: &quot;Haaawww! Haaww hawww heeee? Heeee hawww haaawww haaww!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down with his long neck over where he expected to see his body....his arms and legs....all he saw was a dull grayish-colored animal's body lying on it's side, with four legs, each ending in four hooves. He saw a large equine penis with white (to him it looked white, but was in fact, yellow) piss streaming out of that hugely over sized monster! He saw a big tail lift up, with a black tassel  on the end. He could swear he felt it move!<br />
<br />
With panic rising, he began to remember a few very scary....and apparently very real...events that have transpired last night. &quot;Last night!,&quot; Felix thought. &quot;Did I really turn into a donkey last night? But how? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not believing this for a second, he closed his eyes, and tried speaking again. Once again, he could only manage the obnoxious braying of a jackass that he had apparently turned himself into! Which made him panic even more.<br />
<br />
The person across the way turned towards him, and looked at the pathetic large beast, and approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssshh....It's ok Mr. Donkey. You are safe here now. Be quiet. I am not going to hurt you. Here!&quot; said the same female voice, as she held out a carrot. <br />
<br />
Clearing his head, and trying to calm down, Felix had to think of something. But what? Here he was, stuck as a big ole smelly donkey that he thought he dreamed last night. There didn't seem to be much of anything he COULD do.</p>
