<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You lay face down on the table, regretting your decision with every fiber of your mortal being.  The cake stopped being delicious about three slices in.  Every one after that was a chore.  The dense cake with its super sweet frosting has been your most challenging foe yet.  But you still vanquished the dessert.  You look up, your stomach protesting at even the slight movement.  It was dark outside.  Colby had already gone to bed, and Rani was in her room, probably writing her next chapter.  You see a flash of headlights through the window, George returning from his beer run.  You hear the can pull up the driveway and the engine cut out.  George&#39;s heavy footsteps trudge up the patio and the front door opens.  George stands there, still in the body of the big, beefy construction worker, carrying four 12-packs of various beers.  He sees you through the hall doorway and looks at you curiously.<br />
<br />
He steps into the kitchen and gently sets the boxes on the floor.  &quot;Hey, is everything...&quot;  He glances down at the empty cake tray and breaks out into a wide grin.  &quot;Oh, no way!  You did it!  I though you wouldn&#39;t have time when you went with Rani.  Wow, nice work.&quot;<br />
<br />
You put your head down on the table again, hands on your engorged stomach, fighting the impulse to throw up.<br />
<br />
George frowns.  &quot;Man, you don&#39;t look so good.  You gonna be alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
You belch, feeling some relief at the release of pressure.<br />
<br />
He grins again.  &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll be fine.  Alright.  Fair&#39;s fair.  You get to pick out what shoes I wear next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
You mumble.<br />
<br />
He leans in closer, still grinning.  &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You lift your head off the table.  &quot;Two weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckles.  &quot;I don&#39;t remember agreeing to that, but fine.  You earned it.  You can pick out what I look like for two weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a groan you sit up in your chair.  You take a breath and bend down, picking the chosen shoes off the floor and putting them on the table for George to see.<br />
<br />
George&#39;s grin is nowhere to be seen.  &quot;That&#39;s not funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite your stomach ache, you manage a grin of your own.  &quot;You never said they had to be guy shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the table sat a pair of blood red high heels.  George glowered at them, then at you.  &quot;Haha.  Hilarious.  Now what shoes did you really pick?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod at the high heels.<br />
<br />
George&#39;s bushy eyebrows rise.  &quot;Oh, come on.  Really?  Pick a different pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.  Hey.  I ate an entire birthday cake for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
George grimaces as he picked up one of the shoes between a thumb and forefinger.  &quot;Yeah, but, really?  Let&#39;s make it just one week.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head again.<br />
<br />
He sighs and puts a calloused, hairy hand to his face.  &quot;Ugh, fine.  Have it your way.  I&#39;ll wear the girl shoes for two weeks.  I hope you&#39;re happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up, your stomach sloshing uncomfortably.  &quot;Oh, I will be.  I will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Rani scrunches her brow, trying to wrap her head around what she just heard.  &quot;Okay, so you ate a birthday cake, so now he has to stay in the body of the person who last wore those shoes for two weeks?&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s the next day.  You&#39;ve had time to sleep off the stomach ache from last night, and George had time to prepare for his possible gender swap.  There was a small chance a cross-dresser had last worn the shoes, but you doubt it.<br />
<br />
You nod at Rani, feeling much better now than last night.  &quot;Yup.  Sounds right to me.  Doesn&#39;t it, George?&quot;<br />
<br />
George scowls at you as he pulls on the magic socks.  &quot;I&#39;m not talking to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh, as does Rani.  She sits next to you, watching George scowl as he turns the shoes over in his rough hands, trying to delay the inevitable.  &quot;Oh, come on, George,&quot; she says.  &quot;What&#39;s so bad about being a woman?  Hey, you might be able to get a guy to buy you a drink at that pub.&quot;<br />
<br />
George glances up at you two, unamused.  He sighs heavily, and then takes a deep breath.  Much like one would quickly remove a Band-Aid, he thrusts the high heels onto one large foot, then the other.  The shoes are obviously too small for him, and he&#39;s really only able to stuff a couple of toes into the ends of the shoes, but it seems to be enough.  After a minute, his feet seem to be rapidly shrinking, slipping into the shoes.  George takes a quavering breath as his large, manly feet dwindle in size.<br />
<br />
Rani rolls her eyes.  &quot;Ugh, stop being such a drama queen.  If I can manage being in the body of that big, fat, hairy guy, you&#39;re going to be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wince a little, recalling the night of the break in.  Colby had since replaced the broken window, but you still had the occasional nightmare about someone breaking in and killing you or your friends.  They often caused you to wake up in a sweat.  You would then go downstairs and eat something to calm your nerves.<br />
<br />
George sighs.  &quot;Yeah, but that was only for, like, what, half an hour?  I have to be like this for two weeks!&quot;  Already, he looks to have dropped an inch or two in height.  The hair on his arms is beginning to thin out and disappear, as are his muscles.  He looks down at his rough hands as the callouses begin to soften and the digits thin.  &quot;Oh, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani clasps her hands in an exaggerated manner.  &quot;Oh, George!  This is going to be great!  We can stay up all night and talk about boys, and unicorns, and do each other&#39;s make up!&quot;  She then laughs at the look of horror on George&#39;s face.  &quot;Lighten up, guy!  Geez.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s bald head begins to fill back in with hair.  Fine stubble covers his scalp.  The stubble then begins to rapidly grow out and lighten to a bright, natural blonde.  His facial stubble disappears as the lines on his face and any remaining grey fades away.  His flabby torso tightens as he quickly loses his body fat, his features becoming more refined.  Though, it&#39;s a little hard to tell through his jeans and t-shirt, which are quickly becoming too large for him.  He now looks like a young, thin, 20-something guy with long-ish blonde hair.  He winces and grabs at his crotch.  &quot;Oh, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
You lean toward Rani.  &quot;So, do we call him &#39;he&#39; or &#39;she&#39;, now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani shrugs.  &quot;You know, I was wondering the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s features continue to shift.  His jaw loses its edge, becoming more subtle and feminine.  His nose turns up and thins out, becoming small and petite.  His brow becomes delicate and his lips subtly pout out.  His waist curves in, giving him a slim, feminine shape.  Two shapes begin to push out from under his shirt on his chest.  George looks down, surprised, but not uncomfortable.  His new breasts push out until they are just over average size.  He reaches up, just short of touching them.  His eyebrows become perfectly sculpted and a shimmer shoots through is blonde hair, which now reaches down to his shoulder blades, and it becomes voluminous and wavy.  To tiny holes appear in his earlobes and his fingernails grow out some.  His changes slow and stop.  George is now a woman.<br />
<br />
He stands up, wobbly at first, but he quickly adjusts to the heels.  He does look a little odd in his workman&#39;s t-shirt and jeans with the petite body of a woman and wearing red high heels.<br />
<br />
You chuckle at him.  &quot;Wow, George.  You&#39;re pretty easy on the eyes, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glowers at you.  &quot;Yeah, well-&quot;  He stops short and puts a delicate hand to his throat.  His voice is now soft, and feminine.  And maybe a bit sultry.  &quot;Testing, testing.  Hello, hello.  Wow.  That&#39;s... different.&quot;  He grins.  &quot;You know, this isn&#39;t half bad.&quot;  He reaches up to his breasts again.  &quot;How do you girls live with these things hanging off of you all the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani nudges you growing gut.  &quot;I wonder the same thing about you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
George visits the bathroom to get a good look at himself, walking in those heels like a pro.  He comes back out, tossing his wavy hair over his shoulder, smirking.  &quot;Alright, alright.  It&#39;s not that bad.  A splash of makeup and the right clothes and I could be a bombshell.&quot;  He raises an eyebrow and puts a hand to his hip, thrusting it to one side.  He looks at you.  &quot;What do you think, big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You cross your legs to hide a new development.  &quot;Not bad, I suppose.  Er, uhm, George, would you rather we call you by &#39;he&#39; or &#39;she&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
George looks up and thinks.  &quot;Well, that&#39;s actually a good question.  I mean, I look like a girl and I don&#39;t have a, well, you know.  But I know I&#39;m still a guy.  I mean, I&#39;m still George, and I still like girls.  I dunno, how do these things work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani shrugs.  &quot;If you feel you&#39;re still a guy on the inside, then you&#39;re still a guy, despite how you look on the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
George smirks and tosses his voluminous blonde hair around.  &quot;Then &#39;he&#39;/&#39;him&#39; it is.  Man, I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed having hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand, being sure to grab a nearby book and holding it fairly low.  &quot;Well, now that that&#39;s settled, I need to go do some things.&quot;  You quickly leave the room, taking with you some very confusing feelings.</p>
