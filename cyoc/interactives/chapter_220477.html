<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Enoch recognized the angel that was once Pallaca; now calling herself Lucy; he met her a few times when he had to visit Lamashtu’s palace, those were not easy days as the two siblings were cold towards each other; but now that has changed. Seeing Tarfiel saddened Enoch as she did help him in Japan a few days before he came back to hell; she was obviously tortured before she was dumped down here to be played with by Heka and Qesem. But the third angel confused him; he did not recognize her. Legs of a zebra, her torso and arms that of a cheetah. Even her ample bosom was fur covered. Despite have wings of a blue jay, the only feature of this angel that was remotely human was her face.<br />
<br />
Seeing that all three were naked, Enoch looked at his hand. Bronzed skin, like one gets from a deep tanning session; in fact his entire human torso was tanned looking, not like the red skin he had only an hour ago. Looking up, Enoch waves his hand and simple clothing appears to cover all three female angels; nothing fancy, simple white bra and panties to at least give them a modicum of modesty.<br />
Turning to Sandalphon he nods as he takes the coin Jehovah gave him long ago; Suspecting that the wily old angel somehow knew this would happen; Enoch grips it tightly, feeling the warmth coming off of it. staring into nothing he summons a portal of pure white energy and encourages everyone to follow him.<br />
<br />
“Halt!” who goes there,” A heavily armed angel shouting as a portal suddenly opens up in the throne room of heaven.<br />
“Stay you blade my son,” Sandalphon stepping through the portal; “I have returned and bring with me lost angels. Inform Jehovah of this and,” Sandalphon turning to see Enoch helping the three angels as they are still weak; “get Raphael. We have those who were possessed by chaos itself in need of tending.”<br />
“No,” Tarfeil shaking; “I need to speak to Jehovah. It’s important and can’t wait.”<br />
“Relax Tarfeil,” Enoch trying to reassure her; “your safe.”<br />
“How can I be safe here,” Tarfeil crying; “how can I be safe when I was tortured by Inquisitor Kusheil!”<br />
<br />
******************************************************************<br />
<br />
Both Raphael and Jehovah soon showed up once news of Sandalphon arrived; while Raphael immediately tended to the three angels, it was Jehovah who stared at the white furred wolf-taur as he calmly opened up a portal to pull out a rack of shirts. Many of the guards in the throne room were rather curious of his actions as he picked a black t-shirt with a logo of a German metal band on it. Enoch smiled as on the clothing rack hung a pair of sunglasses with thick black frames.<br />
“Sweet,” Enoch smiling as he grabs the shades and puts them on. They cover his solid blue eyes that now crackle with power, “My other pair broke;” Enoch commenting as he opens the portal back up a shoves the clothing rack back through.<br />
“Are you done,” Jehovah smirking at the angel before him; “because I have questions to ask you Enoch Morningstar.”<br />
“I merged with the sword light bringer,” Enoch walking over to Raphael to help him calm Tarfeil down. “It happened when I, Metatron, Sandalphon and members of my family confronted an army of chaos thralls. Does that answer a good chunk of them,” Enoch looks at Tarfeil and offers her a hand for comfort.<br />
<br />
“Let the healer help you friend,” Enoch speaking to Tarfeil in fluent Japanese.<br />
“You look different,” Tarfeil recognizing Enoch’s voice; “you embraced the light.”<br />
“More like the light embraced me,” Enoch smirking; “But you knew that was going to happen,” Enoch turning around to stare at Jehovah; “didn’t you.”<br />
<br />
Jehovah just stared at the angelic wolf-taur and then slowly smiled; “Well I’ll admit it was a possibility, but  I couldn’t foresee the end result.”<br />
“Asshole,” Enoch glaring.<br />
“Watch your tongue cur,” An angel shouted before Enoch glared at him and readied a sword of pure energy.<br />
 “say that again,” Enoch staring the angel down; “I bloody well dare you.”<br />
“That’s enough,” Jehovah chuckling as he approaches Enoch and helps diffuse the situation. “Lucifer’s first born son may have a mouth that puts Jove’s colorful language to shame,” Jehovah walking to Raphael to see Tarfeil and the angel that the inquisition arrested only yesterday; “but it’s not the first time he has dared to sass me. And it clearly won’t be the last. Azure and Tarfeil,” Jehovah staring at the two weekend angels; “it is so good to see you two again. And you,” Jehovah staring at the cat angel with monarch butterfly wings; “you must be Pallaca.”<br />
“Was Pallaca,” Lucy getting up; “I’d rather go by my old human name Lucy if that is alright.”<br />
“I suppose,” Jehovah nodding; “Sandalphon were is Metatron? We are about to convene the Heavenly Council. We have a new Custodia Ordins,“ Jehovah looking up and then at Enoch; “as well as an unexpected development.”<br />
“Metatron is staying in hell,” Sandalphon sighed; “apparently hell is in a state of civil unrest.”<br />
“I should be down there,” Enoch gritting his teeth; “it’s my home.”<br />
“Not anymore,” Sandalphon interrupting; “you’re no longer a demon.”<br />
“I still have family down there,” Enoch shouting; “they need my help. Plus,” Enoch pausing; “there is something else. Something growing down there,” Enoch muttering; “and it’s not good.”<br />
“Which is why we must have this meeting,” Jehovah shaking his head; “but I think Tarfeil and Azure need to get something off their chests first. So who of you wants to go first,” Jehovah sitting on his throne.<br />
<br />
******************************************************************<br />
<br />
Gemyem Sandstorm burst into the throne room as Nergal was enjoy the blowjob a slave demon was giving him. The heads of the three dissenting senators resting on pikes as he had them swiftly dispatched after Emergency Decree 16 was enacted. Nergal rolls his eyes as his Grand Chancellor interrupted with his rude intrusion.<br />
“Make it quick,” Nergal growling; “no not you bitch, you slow down I want to savor this.<br />
“My liege we have news of an Angel in Dis,” Gemyem clearing his throat; unsure how Nergal would take this news.<br />
“An angel,” Nergal snarling as the slave demon bit his dick; the discomfort irritated Nergal and he punished the woman by driving a dagger into her neck, killing her instantly. “That has to be a joke,” Nergal pulling up his cod piece; vexed as his happy ending was just denied.<br />
“It’s no joke my lord,” Gemyem looking scared; “scouts report him circling Dis.”<br />
“Then shoot him down,” Nergal staring at the dead demon who blood rapidly pools on the throne room floor.<br />
“He is not in range of the archers or spell slingers,” Gemyem shaking his head; “several fliers tried to intercept him only to be cut down.”<br />
<br />
Nergal was silent as he pondered this development. Unable to take down the angel with conventional means; Nergal wondered if unconventional means would work. He picks up a chaos crystal that was gifted to him by Beelzebub; a reward for a successful coup, however Nergal failed to inform Beelzebub that Lucifer, Lilith and Astaroth are still alive in the dungeons below. Lucifer and Lilith in a magically induced coma while Astaroth was getting tourured.<br />
“Leave me,” Nergal staring at the crystal; Gemyem didn’t need to be told as he beat a hasty retreat from the throne room. Alone, Nergal smashes the crystal to release the remnant of Aldremach. A portion of the shade was kept in a second crystal as a backup while the rest was being cut down by Enoch in the desserts of the second circle. Weak as it may be, Nergal was confident that it could deal with a single angel.<br />
“There is an angel circling Dis,” Nergal speaking to the shade; “kill it.”<br />
Nergal watches the shade leave the throne room. With his erection still raging he signals for the next of Lucifer’s concubines; now his sex slaves to be dragged into to continue to suck him off.</p>
