<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They went up to Tony's room, but before Rudy could have Tony to himself, Mrs. St. Martin shouted from downstairs that Tony had to take out the trash and do some other chores and he had to do them right now.  Tony sighed and rolled his eyes but went downstairs and started taking care of them.  <br />
<br />
Rudy took the opportunity to change himself.  He'd had Tony explain everything he knew about the chronivac and that included Tony explaining how he came to be a male model/athlete.  He remembered Tony saying that they had input enough photos of another model for Tony to have taken that body but that Tony had settled on the Tyson Ballou shape plus some addition of muscle.  Rudy looked through every folder in the chronivac program on the laptop but didn't find anything.  Finally, he looked in 'My Pictures' and found a folder labeled &quot;Option 1 Chris Kramer&quot;.  In it were about 50 pictures of that male model, a slender blond apollo.  Rudy caught his breath.  <br />
&quot;That can be me&quot; he said and corrected himself in his head.  Will be me.<br />
<br />
He typed away, furiously, moving the pictures to the chronivac program and nearly tossed the laptop on the ground when it beeped and displayed the message &quot;Data Sufficient for Profile Creation&quot;.  One one side of the screen, a 3-D image of the naked body created by the chronivac from the pictures slowly rotated.  With a few toggles, Rudy was able to zoom in on any part of it.  When the program prompted him &quot;Are there any desired changes to profile?  Y/N&quot;, Rudy typed 'Y'.  He made his new penis as long as the longest he'd ever seen in the soccer goalie's huge stash of gay porn mags.  He added a little muscle to the model's tight but unimpressive buns and that was it.  Rudy trembled as he reached for the 'enter' key but took a deep breath and pressed.  He saw the emitter glow yellow for a moment and he felt an electric wave pass through him.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Rudy's perspective started rising as he grew taller.  He watched in the mirror outside Tony's closet door as his black hair lightened to mid brown, then chestnut brown and then became blond.  It also grew out to collar length.  He felt his shoulders widen a bit and his waist and hips narrow.  His new 6'1&quot; tall model body was much more slender than his 5'8&quot; body had been.  Rudy watched his fingers lengthen and felt his size 7 shoes become extremely uncomfortable as his feet did likewise.  Simultaneously, the seat of his pants became tight and his little weiner became a gay porn star phallus.  His pants, still those of 5'8&quot; Rudy became both too short and too tight.  The same was true of his shirt, as a button popped off revealing his new smooth chest.  Last of all, Rudy's face became the striking, traffic stopping visage of the male model.  Rudy stood transfixed by himself in the mirror, touching first one gentle fingertip to his beautiful new face then touching his godlike countenance over and over in delighted fascination.  It's really me.  It's *really* me! <br />
<br />
What snapped Rudy out of it was the sound of Eric Powers' voice coming down the street.  Through the open window next to Tony's desk, Rudy could hear Eric talking to one of Tony's neighbors.  <br />
<br />
Rudy didn't mind Jack.  Even Claire wasn't that bad if she had just not been after his Tony.  But Rudy hated Eric.  How many times had he been in a group of football players who'd made fun of him and the other soccer players?  <br />
<br />
Rudy jumped back to the desk in his almost painfully constricting clothes and typed as fast as he could.  He was getting very good at navigating the Chronivac 4.0 menus by now and in just a minute had a more appropriate fate picked out for Eric.  He pointed the emitter out the window.  Eric was still 80 feet up the road.  Rudy wondered if the emitter could hit him that far away.  But Eric was coming down the street right toward the window and there was no one else around to accidentally get hit.  Rudy hit 'enter'.  Eric twitched but kept coming.  Rudy frantically navigated the menus again and hit 'enter' again as Eric had gotten half way to the St. Martins' house.  Rudy smiled.<br />
<br />
Eric felt an electric wave pass through him and all at once his giant fit style jeans were skin tight and his untucked shirt was bursting off him.<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he muttered.<br />
He was now essentially naked in the middle of the road, but he had worse problems than nudity.  His body was becoming incredibly heavy and ballooning outward.  As he watched in horror, his skin turned gray and became an incredibly tough hide.  His nose and mouth projected forward and his teeth all became giant and flat.  His hands and feet lost flexibility and his fingers and toes their differentiation from his hands and feet respectively.  <br />
<br />
Eric tried to cry out at what was happening to him but made only a weird sort of deep pitched grunt.  He fell onto all fours now as walking upright seemed just impossible.  He looked in the window of the nearest car and saw not Eric but a hippo.<br />
<br />
What!?  What the hell's going on here?<br />
<br />
He stared and stared.  How can this be?  This is impossible.  A guy can't just become a hippo all of a sudden.  What the fuck?!<br />
<br />
He was jolted from his frantic contemplation by the sound of a car horn.  He looked over his shoulder.  The driver of a bright red mini beeped his horn again.  <br />
<br />
Alright.  Alright.  I'll move.  Eric waddled off to one side and the car zipped by.  Eric realized he was bigger than the car.  He also realized that he felt very uncomfortable being so dry.  Just down the street in the direction away from Tony's house, he could see a swampy wetland.  Ahhh water!  Eric headed that way.<br />
<br />
Rudy reached for his cell phone and dialed the vets again.  &quot;You're not going to believe this . . &quot; he began.  That done, he chuckled.  But he looked down at his clothes and realized he'd screwed up in not modifying them, too.  Oh well, Tony's six one and slender, too.  I should be able to wear his stuff.<br />
<br />
Rudy had just finished stripping off his old 5'8&quot; tall clothes when Tony came back in the room.</p>
