<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“That’s not going to be me,” Steve whispered as he felt the baby twist itself in the fluid filling his womb.  <br />
<br />
“I’m not going to go into labor,” said a shaky, high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to get up tho-ooowwwww!” Steve tried to tell himself, only to lose his voice to the pained howls of an expecting mother whose body decided that now would be a good time to squeeze in a practice contraction.  Fortunately, this one only lasted a few seconds before Steve’s muscles relaxed and the vice surrounding his womb relaxed.<br />
<br />
“I have to make it up.”  <br />
<br />
Steve didn’t waste any time as he raised his hand onto the first stair, then the second, then the third, desperately pulling himself a little bit further each time.  It wasn’t long before Steve had gone far enough that his knees had made it to the stairs and, before long, he was halfway to the landing.<br />
<br />
Each step up was a painful reminder of the warm milk sloshing in his breasts, as well as the swaying presence of his pressurized womb hanging below him.  He could also feel exhaustion begin to creep into his muscles.  Every time he grabbed onto a new step it was harder than the last, and each time he lifted his body up it felt like he would lack the strength to do it again.<br />
<br />
“I can’t go into labor.”  That was Steve’s new mantra, and he told it to himself with every new step.  Deep down inside he knew that repeatedly chanting something like that… chanting words wasn’t how someone like him found strength.  The will to succeed, to make it out of this situation, that was what should be motivating him.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, while Steve was still a man mentally, he had to contend with the very obvious reality that his body wasn’t.  In fact, his body was the worst kind of wasn’t.  Unlike earlier when he’d just had to contend with being a female anthro, now he had to contend with that plus the fact that this body was built to be a breeding slave.  <br />
<br />
Steve could only imagine that if he could see his DNA under a microscope, that it would consist of two gigantic X chromosomes that were shackled in chains.  Between the numerous pairs of breasts dangling from his chest or the tight, warm cunt nestled between his legs, there wasn’t a drop of testosterone in Steve’s current body.  <br />
<br />
What worked for him when he’d had a man’s body no longer affected his new, feminine one.  So, if chanting a mantra was what it took to get him up those stairs, then that was a small homage to the maternity goddess that he was willing to make.<br />
<br />
“I can’t go into labor… I can’t go into labor…”  Steve continued the chant until he saw the landing in front of him.  Gripping down with his free hand, Steve put everything he had into pushing off with his shin and launched himself onto the landing.<br />
<br />
“I made it…” he panted, “I…” as he ceased his chant, Steve felt all of the exhaustion that had pent up as he climbed the stairs flood into his body at once.  His heart was pounding, his lungs were out of breath, and every muscle in his arms and legs was totally spent.  He tried to lift his left arm, only to feel it go out from under him as the rest of his body crashed down onto his left side.<br />
<br />
The sudden impact caused his breasts to painfully slap against themselves, while the pressure in his stomach amplified to the point of bursting as the baby inside began thrashing again.  “Unnnfff,” he moaned as he wrapped an arm around his belly button and looked down.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that he saw something – looking past his bloated stomach he saw a skunk girl sitting on her hands and knees at the bottom of the stairs.  He could see the front row of her breasts hanging down and, further behind that, the tip of her massive belly peaking out underneath her.<br />
<br />
Then Steve saw the skunk’s wide, quivering eyes and slightly ajar mouth as she looked up the stairs in absolute terror.  But where was… Steve followed her gaze until his eyes landed on his own stomach - but that wasn’t where the skunk was looking.  No, it was… Steve kept mentally following along below his belly until he felt the lips of his cunt clench together.  Was she looking at…?<br />
<br />
Steve felt the muscles inside of him beginning to wind up again.<br />
<br />
“No!” He screamed.  This was it; this was the challenge.  It was just like when he was a rabbit.  The app was giving him a way out of labor and everything that entailed, but it didn’t care how weak or docile Steve’s body was.  It didn’t care how much he had already pushed it or how impossible its expectations might be.  In fact, that was the whole point of the challenge.<br />
<br />
Relative to his current body, the challenges he’d faced as a rabbit had been a breeze.  He’d succeeded and been given a second chance, only to mess that up to the point that he was stuck in a body that would make transforming back into that rabbit look like heaven.  Now his body was far more inconvenient, as was the challenge associated with it.<br />
<br />
That meant right now, as the phantom version of him stared up at his pussy, Steve only had two choices.  Either he could ignore his weak, female, and exceptionally gravid body to drag himself up those stairs.  Or he could give in, accept that this was his life, and then that skunk at the bottom of the stairs would get to watch as a fountain of water poured out of his cunt. <br />
<br />
There was no choice, not for Steve.  He rolled back onto his hands and knees, ignoring the painful thumps of protest that came from the baby inside of him.  He mustered every ounce of energy that he had, directed it to his limbs, and began propelling himself towards the next set of stairs.<br />
<br />
But the closer he got to those stairs, the more he felt the muscles inside of him winding up.  “I’m doing it!” he cried, “I’m not giving in!  I’m not going to give birth!  I’m not going to spend my life as a girl!  I’m going up the stairs so, please!”<br />
<br />
Steve planted his hand on the first step just as a spring unloaded inside of him.  It was a sadly familiar pattern by this point as his waves of pain rode his body like a cowboy on a bucking bronco.  His womb clamped down, his cervix stretched as the baby pushed down from above, and his pussy clenched shut as the muscles of his vagina pointless ground against themselves – but Steve’s water didn’t break.<br />
<br />
“I’m…” he panted.<br />
<br />
“Not…” Steve grabbed onto the next step up.<br />
<br />
“Going…” the heart in his chest pounded as he used a shin to push his body upward.<br />
<br />
“Into…” the baby in his womb slammed into his bladder, forcing a few beads of urine to drip out of his crotch.<br />
<br />
“LABOR!”  Steve shouted at the top of his lungs as agony permeated every nerve of his body.  But he didn’t stop, he couldn’t stop.  <br />
<br />
The flesh in his stomach kept clenching down as it felt like his insides were on fire, but the pain, the pressure, the weight hanging off the front of his body – none of it mattered.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going into labor…” more exasperated pants marked the conquest of another few steps as Steve’s body continued on its labor practice run, and Steve continued dragging it upwards.<br />
<br />
I’m not going into labor…” he was almost to the door at the top.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going into labor…” just a few more steps.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going into labor…” he was right there, all he had to do was to open the door handle. He steeled his will, dropped the cell phone on the top step, gripped down as hard as he could, then reached up towards the door handle and…<br />
<br />
His hand swiped through empty air before planting on the side of the door.  He’d missed.  He’d used the last bits of strength that he had left, and he’d missed.<br />
<br />
Steve took a deep breath.  His body felt so hot and he could feel warm sweat begin to matt his fur.  Just one second, that was all he needed to catch his breath… surely the app…  Steve’s body was still on fire as the false contraction continued, but now he felt something new begin to wind itself inside of him.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the portion of his internal anatomy that Steve could feel the best right now was the firm piece of flesh that constituted his cervix.  Every ounce of energy that the contraction was putting into his womb was being focused on driving the baby’s snout painfully into the top of that cervix.  The amount of pressure on it was so immense that Steve was surprised that it had managed to hold on as long as it had.  But now, he felt the same winding sensation from earlier beginning to form inside of it.<br />
<br />
He knew what this was – up until now, the powerful muscles his cervix had kept it clamped shut, but now they were preparing to do the opposite.  All they had to do was to open it just the teeniest tiniest bit, and every last ounce of fluid in his womb would come gushing out.  And once those muscles got started there was no stopping them – they’d keep going until he was fully dilated and the baby descended down into his vagina.<br />
<br />
“No, please!”  Steve cried out, but he knew that there was no point.  The app didn’t care if he begged.  If anything, it enjoyed it.  If Steve wanted to get out of this with his cervix intact, he couldn’t take a break, not even for a second.  <br />
<br />
There was no energy left in his body, but it didn’t matter.  He could feel the pressure in his cervix increasing, in another second it would open, the fluid would come gushing out and this false contraction would very quickly turn into a real one…<br />
<br />
“I’M NOT GOING INTO LABOR!”<br />
<br />
Steve kicked off from his shin, launching his body forward as his arm shot towards the doorhandle.  That was everything he had, and everything he could do.  As he felt his cervix begin to pull apart, Steve could only hope that this time his aim would be better.</p>
