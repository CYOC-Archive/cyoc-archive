<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'Well,' Ty thought to himself, 'I guess I could do what V&oslash;l suggested. But where should I go?'<br />
<br />
Ty used his new paw-hand to spin the globe around a few times, looking for anything interesting. He thought about going to Ireland, <br />
where dobhar-chus were from, but he figured he might scare people there. After all, the creature he was now was infamous for eating <br />
humans. Ty ended up spinning the image back to the US.<br />
<br />
With no other thoughts making themselves known to him, he re-zoomed to his old house. Mark and June were gone, Dustin was sitting <br />
in his room, but what's this? Out in the yard, there is a young boy. Ty had never seen him before. The boy was the same age as Ty, <br />
and he was only slightly more developed than Ty had been. Ty's brain immediately presented him with the knowledge that this boy was <br />
his replacement as Mark and June's foster child. He was out in the garden, weeding them to perfection like Ty had been forced to while <br />
Dustin lounged around inside. <br />
<br />
'They haven't changed,' Ty said, almost sadly. But he knew what he had to do. <br />
<br />
He moved the image to the woods behind the house and stepped into the portal. His feet touched the ground and he looked around. He <br />
had shrunk to a much more proportional seven feet tall, as the size he had been in the Order Space would have made him a <br />
skyscraper on Earth. He looked up at where he had come from, but there was no sign of the portal. Had he been able to witness his <br />
own entrance, it would have been like Aslan's with a bright light heralding his appearance. <br />
<br />
Ty looked towards the house, it wasn't far off and he could see the top of the kid's head. Ty changed himself so that he was only seven <br />
inches long, replaced his fish tail with a regular one, made his mouth smaller, and dropped to all fours to avoid suspicion. At least, as <br />
little suspicion can come from a mini-otter with white fur and black markings. <br />
<br />
Everything was bigger now, and Ty couldn't see the house past the log in front of him. He scampered over the wood and down the <br />
slight hill to where the boy was weeding the garden. From this closer distance, Ty saw that the boy had light brown hair, deep blue <br />
eyes, and a childish face. He was a lot less lanky than Ty had been, he had a runner's build with powerful legs and a slim form. But he <br />
was shorter than Ty had been, probably only five foot four. <br />
<br />
Ty's new mind continued to feed him information. The boy's name was Jake, he has been their foster child for four years, and today is <br />
his fifteenth birthday. He was an almost perfect replacement of Ty, as he had been ignored by Mark and June as well. <br />
<br />
Jake continued weeding, unaware of the small creature approaching him. Ty moved over behind a small bush and watched the boy <br />
work. Jake sat up from his work, took off a glove, and wiped the sweat from his brow. While he was distracted, Ty placed himself on top <br />
of the discarded glove and waited for the boy to put it back on. As Jake reached for the glove, he saw Ty and pulled his hand away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Where did you come from, little guy?&quot; Jake asked in the sort of cutesy voice you use when talking to animals. He used his <br />
gloved hand and tried to shoo Ty away, but he refused to budge. &quot;You're one strange animal. Come to think of it, I don't know that I've <br />
even seen an animal like you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty just stared up at him. Jake went to reach for the glove in an attempt to simply pull it out from underneath him, but Ty shook his head <br />
in a clear &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? 'No'? Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty just shook his head again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, move!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty wouldn't budge, he stood there and waited for Jake to make the next move. With a hopeless shrug, Jake went inside the house. A <br />
little later, he came back out, leading Dustin over to the creature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, Jake, I thought this was something important,&quot; Dustin rolled his eyes. &quot;This things not even big, just kick it out of the way...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Dustin positioned his foot to kick Ty off the glove, Ty used his power to stop Dustin in his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell?!&quot; Dustin yelled. &quot;I can't move!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty used his powers to make Dustin swing bavkwards and kick himself, making him stumple and fall forward on his face. He regained <br />
movement and scrambled back away from the creature. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is that thing?&quot; he asked in amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know! It just sort of appeared on my glove! I tried to move it, but it shook its head at me, like it's trying to say something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded his head in response. Then he backed off the glove. Jake moved forward and put on the glove. Once it was on his hand, Ty <br />
jumped up into his palm and scurried up his arm to his shoulder. Jake freaked and tried to brush him off, but Ty held tight. Ty used his <br />
power to make Jake stop fighting him. Jake suddenly stood still as Dustin got up off the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is too freaky!&quot; Dustin was earnestly spooked. <br />
<br />
Ty used his powers once more to supplant feelings of safety and happiness in Jake's mind while he put feelings of pain and fear in <br />
Dustin's mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell is that thing?!&quot; Dustin yelled, scared out of his wits. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Jake repeated slowly, &quot;But I think he wants me to keep him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! No way in Hell are you bringing that thing inside!&quot; Dustin screamed, his eyes wide with fear. <br />
<br />
Ty shot Dustin an evil look and forced an image of himself in the house into Dustin's brain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm sorry!&quot; Dustin was overwhelmed with fear, he quickly ran inside the house, slamming the door behind him. <br />
<br />
Jake turned to look at Ty; &quot;Whatever you did to him, thank you.&quot;</p>
