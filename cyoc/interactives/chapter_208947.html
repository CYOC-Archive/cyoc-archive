<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for the double post. Logged me out for some reason when I posted.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rising sun&#39;s light slinks through Dylan&#39;s blinds. Waking the burly bloke as he rolls onto his side to avoid the glare, instinctively wincing as his bandaged foot is crushed under his other leg. But there&#39;s no pain, as he looks down to his hairy and bult lower half to see loose wrappings of cloth. His foot is free, and healed. Dylan testing the waters as he concentrates on lifting it into the air, then deciding to take a leap of faith. Positioning himself to the side of the bed, feet inches away from the wooden floorboards as he gets up and stands straight. No throbbing pain, no falling back onto the sheets, it&#39;s as good as new.<br />
<br />
&quot;Healed overnight, huh... but work doesn&#39;t need to know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckles to himself, going to the main room of the home where Mike is busy cooking breakfast. Only in his briefs, as he darts between fridge and pans. Making eggs and bacon, completely focused on his task as Dylan sneaks up to him. Wrapping his arms around the smaller man’s body once he gets close, Mike jumping back in surprised, and Dylan tightening his grip. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck- who- Dylan? You&#39;re standing up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep! All better, but don&#39;t tell my boss. Got games to play.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I will then, don&#39;t want to be the only one working.&quot;<br />
&quot;Easy way to change that my man, just take the day off.&quot;<br />
&quot;... Yeah, good idea. Kings waiting for us after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s hands roam his roommate’s chest. He&#39;s seen Mike shirtless a few times around the house, but he was never this built. There’re clear forming abs for the guy, and his skin is nice and soft. Mike leaning back against the stronger man’s chest, it&#39;s wider than before, and hairier. Tickling his shoulders as he relaxes, feeling something hard starting to rub against his briefs. Dylan getting aroused, mouth opened as his hot breath blows against his friend&#39;s neck. Hesitation starting to rise in his body, he is straight, isn’t he? He never wanted to fuck a guy. Never. He backs away, turning around and hiding his erection as Mike does the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Going to hit the gym, then log on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, uh, see you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shuffles back into his room. Changing into a singlet and shorts as he gets out the front door and jogs down the streets. The cool morning breeze blowing past him, as he excitedly journeys to the local gym. Finally able to use his legs again, finally able to work out and bulk up. He was worried he&#39;d start losing his definition if he kept vegging out at home, but now he can get even stronger. Maybe even more like the minotaur he is in Reborn Venture.<br />
<br />
Turning a few more blocks, he enters into the gym. The workers there happy to see Dylan return for a workout. Passing him a towel as he wipes off sweat and starts off with some weights. Working his arms as he lifts the barbells, quickly starting to grunt and groan as his body readjusts to the exercise. Counting as he goes, and finding the task easier and easier. His grip readjusting several times as his torso widens, the broad man starting to gain a quarterbacks build. Lifting again as his arms become rough and calloused, biceps straining and showing rampant growth. The burning throughout his upper body feeling wonderful, his eyes glancing down to see his cock trying to burst free from his shorts. Dylan gasping in-between his strained grunts, he can&#39;t just stop because he&#39;s feeling horny, he needs to do a few more. Counting another three, having his abs harden and define, then finally setting down the bar. Making sure no one is watching as he pats his cock, and wonders if more exercise might excite it further.<br />
<br />
Off from the weights he moves over to the treadmill. It&#39;s still an awkward spot in the morning, so he&#39;s the only one here. Something that encourages him to continue and see just how much this might excite him further. Starting off with a light jog as his steps are starting to be placed further apart. His top-heavy body starting to have a more normalised form as his legs grow another few inches. Jog turning to sprint as his calves grow and support the harder activity. Cock throbbing with need as he breaks into a full run, keeping up with the treadmill due to the need emanating from his dick. His body tired, but the pleasure too much to resist. The changing man feeling new hairs coat his legs, as he finally reaches his limit. Both physically and mentally, as he turns off the treadmill, and floods his pants with his own cum. His wet and sticky briefs rubbing against his body, as he slows with the treadmill, then collapses to his knees as it stops entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan? Oh, you&#39;ve made a mess of things hon, let me help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tired Englishman looks over to the source of the voice. It&#39;s one of the workers, Charles. He was probably the least qualified employee at the company, not exactly strong, but a decent runner at the very least. But he looked strikingly different. His athletic body much thinner, hips wide and ass big. Curvier than anything else, with shoulder length blonde hair and large pink lips. Smooth and hairless skin mostly hidden behind the gyms uniform, baring his right sleeve that was pulled back, metal bracelet tightly attached to his spindly arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charles?&quot;<br />
&quot;Something wrong big boy? You&#39;ve gotten this everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan doesn&#39;t resist as Charles takes the towel and wipes the hardworking man clean. Chest, pits, head. Sweat dampening the towel as it is quickly absorbed into the fabric. Dylan starting to enjoy the feeling of a feminine man servicing him. It feels good, it feels right. His sexuality being questioned as he wonders if he&#39;d enjoy this more if it was a busty woman cleaning him up. Charles finally getting to the good part as he takes a whiff of the damp towel, tossing it aside for later and grabbing another clean one from the bench. His calculated hand pulling down Dylan&#39;s shorts and briefs. Wiping away the pool of spunk directly from the clothes and cock. His skilled fingers pressing the fabric against the broad man&#39;s shaft, Dylan looking at the workers cute face as he starts to grin. Yeah, he&#39;s definitely happier to have a cute guy doing this for him.<br />
<br />
Charles throws the second cloth next to the first. Pulling Dylan&#39;s pants and briefs back up as the two get to their feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, hon. You shouldn&#39;t waste your load like that. If you&#39;re getting pent up, then just come see me or one of the other workers. We&#39;d love to give you some relief while you&#39;re here, okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe next time then, if you can handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan rolls his shoulders as he leaves the gym. A far stronger man than he was before he came in, jogging back to his home and opening the door. Seeing quite the sight ahead...</p>
