<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man scooped up the amphibious James, and seemed amused a little that the small frog was not freaking out or anything about this. The man&#39;s name was Wallace &quot;Wally&quot; Mossden. Wally was 27 years old, and currently lived with his three roommates Stuart, Logan and Bryce. He was about the most muscular of the bunch, having in his youth been an awkward and nerdy guy who didn&#39;t exactly have a lot to show off. But now that he spent such a long time in the gym, Wally was nothing if not a bodybuilding fanatic. He had even gotten a card with which to begin heading to shows and expos to compete.<br />
<br />
As he got up out of the water, Wally groused a little bit as he got dressed again - though in just a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. He kept James in a small container that he filled with some water and then set on the passenger side door. Wally and his friends were all guys who were involved in fitness in some capacity - and another commonality between them was their unique practice. They were nudists, enjoying the aesthetics of their growing bodies and preferring, at home and whenever possible, to be in as little clothing as possible.<br />
<br />
Wally was the one that personally enjoyed the life style the most. And in fact by this point he outright disliked having to wear much clothes if any. But then when he was out on the road or in public, he had to make sure that some religious nuts didn&#39;t feel &quot;offended&quot; by his body. Even though everybody had all those things they deemed so obscene.<br />
<br />
By the time Wally got home, he looked over and checked on James. He tilted his head a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little buddy, you&#39;re really weirdly chill about heading off to my home like this.&quot; He murmured, and then picked up the container.<br />
<br />
James wanted to say that is because he was just hoping to find a secure indoor place where he wouldn&#39;t be in very much danger. Especially not from that horrible nightmare bird out to eat him. As he was brought in, James swore that this was a really nice place. Maybe even nicer than his own home. It seemed like it was an apartment room, but tricked out and with a lot of stuff going on. He felt relieved when he saw there was an aquarium there - and one without hostile occupants. Just a bunch of other frogs.<br />
<br />
Other frogs. But James wasn&#39;t a frog. He was a boy. And he was relieved he could get a new place to stay that was safe. But he didn&#39;t want to get stuck here. He wanted HOME, dammit.<br />
<br />
As for Wally, as soon as he was inside, Wally shut the door behind him and started stripping naked again. &quot;Ahh, that feels nice. Letting the skin breathe after so long on the road wearing those clothes! Hey Stu! Logan! Bryce? You guys home? Ah, guess not yet.&quot; Wally walked over and picked up the container to bring poor James over to the aquarium.<br />
<br />
James found himself wondering, as he looked at the enormous naked man, if he was brought into the home of a total weirdo.<br />
<br />
Wally, once he put James into the aquarium, immediately turned his head when he heard the locks to the door being opened. He guessed it was his friends coming home. True to form, it was Stuart and Bryce returning back home from their college classes. Wally walked out to greet them, &quot;Hey guys! Welcome home. I found a new buddy for our aquarium!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuart, a disorderly black haired, somewhat pale nerdy guy with green eyes, took off his shirt as he locked the door behind him, revealing his astonishingly built physique. In terms of body aesthetics, Stuart was the most toned and jacked outside of Wally - though he lacked the sheer size Wally enjoyed. As Stuart stripped down, he exhaled, &quot;Whew man, feels good to come home and strip down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryce shortly behind him was doing likewise. Bryce had been the chubbiest of the crew, up until he took on Wally as his personal trainer. Then he developed and grew, becoming more stocky than chubby, attaining a powerfully built if still obese physique. He had a remaining extra chin, but what Bryce lacked in tone he more than made up for in size. Bryce&#39;s enormous pecs rested a little on his large if tight gut. &quot;You know it. They just don&#39;t make clothes for men as big as me.&quot; Bryce flexed an arm, showing a lot of size, but not many veins.<br />
<br />
Wally grinned and balanced against a wall, &quot;Would you guys be up for joining me tonight in inviting some of the sorority chicks over here? See if they&#39;re down for some orgiastic fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuart enthusiastically nodded, &quot;You know I&#39;m always in for an orgy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was hoping to try something new.&quot; Bryce said, looking over at Stuart - and more to the point, Stuart&#39;s ass, &quot;I&#39;ve mostly done straight sex up to now, and it&#39;s all been great. But I&#39;m getting curious. Stuart, can I try fucking you tonight while you go with one of the chicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuart cupped his chin, thinking about that, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve mostly done straight sex before myself. But part of this little arrangement is trying new things. So! I&#39;ll let you use my ass tonight - but only if you blow me later on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wally chuckled and walked forward, putting his arms around Stuart and Bryce, &quot;So glad we&#39;re exploring our sexualities tonight. I&#39;ll give anything a try!&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as James settled into his odd new home, he started finding himself feeling weird. It was like there was something off about his frog body. Or more accurately, like there was something distinct. It was almost like an unusual energy. Like he had something... James cringed a little and saw in the mirror-like wall of the aquarium it looked like his body was glowing.<br />
<br />
Something was happening to him. Was he...was he gonna do something to the weirdo patrol downstairs? It looked like magic of some kind.</p>
