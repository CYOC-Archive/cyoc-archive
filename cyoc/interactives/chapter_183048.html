<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the things that had always made Animalia a bit different from other places in America was with the speed and rate that many infrastructure changes had come about. America had had plenty of boom towns in its past, many of which also related to lucky finds of gold and the like, but many of these also declined rather quickly once established or the best pickings were gone. But Animalia hadn&#39;t really had that problem, so far. Now, some of it was the connection to Horizon, the scientific research company that had dabbled in a great many things that ranged from pharmaceuticals to nutritional supplements of all kinds. It had thus funded a lot of the construction that became Animalia, which then brought in a fair amount of business that Animalians proved eager to work at helping with.<br />
<br />
It had been one of the things that parked a lot of economic growth in Animalia itself from its founding. And because Animalia&#39;s edicts had been accepted and Lyre ultimately accepted Animalia, possibly because a fair number of people ended up being accidentally converted when Animalia was first formed, that then created a bit of local acceptance that further made Animalia attractive to new people and new members. Even a few Humans moved to Lyre to be closer to Animalia, even if they didn&#39;t become Animalians. The result became a rather inclusive society that many at times tried to highlight as a success for their own political side in their own ways, and that image of an inclusive society was drawing new people to Lyre/Animalia. Most of these were Asian Americans who had been taking some form of heat since the Covid 19 pandemic had, since the previous year, become a politicized, and they&#39;d come to Lyre/Animalia, hoping that Animalia wouldn&#39;t have the negative attention they&#39;d get elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And Kamana and Chaman were not the first to come up, there were others. Many of them came from all parts of the country, and often brought some of their own ideas, hopes and dreams with them, which did ultimately bring some positive response when most of the Animalians were more curious about things than hostile. At the same time, after four years of living along side Animalia, Lyre&#39;s Human residents seemed far more open, which partially brought some positive attention from those that had moved to Animalia well before the present crisis that was going on in other parts of the country. This then brought up a lot of construction on the south side of Lyre and Animalia, near where some of the new mansions had been put in and where Rebecca and Gannondorf&#39;s &quot;ranch&quot; was. This in turn brought greater curiosity about what was being built.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this will be where my restaurant will be,&quot; said a modest looking Chinese American man as he looked out over the street to where some Beaver Animalians were putting together the frames to begin pouring in cement for the foundation, &quot;and with all the schools letting out now, I&#39;m hoping to have things in stock as soon as can be. Though... I&#39;m surprised Lyre or Animalia doesn&#39;t have a restaurant like this already.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Animalian he was talking to proved to be Mr. Shikamatsu, who was out for a morning jog when he&#39;d come across the man as he watched the construction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Lyre was a pretty small town before Animalia,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu answered, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t surprise me that they didn&#39;t have an actual Chinese restaurant before. And while Animalia would attract all sorts of people to come and join, some more surprising than others, outside of those living on Heiya Island, most of those Humans that have become Animalians have not been of Asian ancestry. My family moved here before Animalia, and we&#39;d run some small lessons from a dojo we have north of here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reports of your dojo were part of why my family and I came here from Florida,&quot; the man commented, &quot;you were all welcomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;d BEEN here awhile before Animalia started, so many in Lyre have known us fairly well,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu commented, &quot;the first to &quot;convert&quot; was my daughter&#39;s pet rabbit, and that was more a result of the initial outbreak. My wife then converted to treat a heart condition as Project Phoenix got started or tested, I converted to be with her, and my daughter converted wanting a sister in our pet... Yumi. So we&#39;ve been well integrated and to a degree, I can&#39;t complain on getting my youth back. It&#39;s let me and my wife improve our dojo and help teach self-discipline and control through martial arts. And it&#39;s worked out quite well...&quot; He paused to chuckle, &quot;I may end up having the good fortune of having one my students marry into the family as my daughter has taken a liking to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s still all success and something is an inspiration,&quot; the Chinese American man answered, &quot;and even if I don&#39;t convert... it&#39;ll be worth the move to be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to convert?&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu wondered.<br />
<br />
The man nodded and gave a shrug, &quot;I have nothing against Animalia and Animalians... but I&#39;m quite fine as I am. And in the restaurant business... I&#39;ve found it&#39;s better not to be carrying around extra hair or feathers. You wouldn&#39;t want that in your food, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as a Rabbit Animalian... I&#39;m more of a vegetarian now, though I must say that the people that have come up with meat substitutes that are plant based are pretty good,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu replied, &quot;but I suppose I see your point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so long as I am welcome... I would do my best to assure that my cooking meets all the dietary requirements that Animalians have,&quot; the man then smiled, &quot; It may require some experimenting, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find something that works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be welcome,&quot; Mr. Shikamatsu replied as one of the members of the Rhino Guard, patrolling on foot came by quietly, looked at an electronic light, timed how long it would stay on each color and then moved on, &quot;and if anyone comes in threatening force... Animalia&#39;s police are quite attentive.&quot;</p>
