<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adrian couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit bad for Matt. He wasn&#39;t sure what all was going on, but the way the other guy spoke to him, made Adrian feel deeply uncomfortable. Not that he could do anything about it. It was just so strange. The guy was a literal giant. Adrian couldn&#39;t remember seeing a guy that large ever in his life. And with him being so big, there was no way he wouldn&#39;t try to compete for some kind of sport of weight lifting competition.<br />
<br />
Eventually Adrian just stopped trying to think about it. It&#39;d be another day before Matt would come in for his workouts. He&#39;d just ask Matt then. Right now, he was more focused on this intense hunger he was feeling. Adrian stopped by a local fast food joint and ordered himself one of the biggest burgers and fries he could get before going home. A cheat meal sounded so amazing right now. It was like all he&#39;d had over the last two months was chicken and rice. His body craved for a bit of fat. <br />
<br />
&quot;God damn...&quot; Adrian cursed as he bit into the burger. The savory taste of the fatty meat and the sweetness from the ketchup and mustard hit his tongue. He practically let out a moan at the second bite. The flavors were intense. &quot;What the hell..?&quot; he stared at the burger in his dining room. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if all he had was chicken and rice. He thought over his past meals and what he knew he had seemed to contradict with what he felt like he had. <br />
<br />
Adrian thought back to what Matt had said. Most of it sounded like nonsense, but he felt like he remembered something about desires. Adrian couldn&#39;t deny that he would love to lose that little bit of extra fat, but the amount of dedication to do so was way too much. However, looking down at his shirt, he couldn&#39;t deny that his stomach looked just a little bit tighter. Or that his pecs seemed to be a bit more defined. Veins seemed to press against his arms a bit more. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way...&quot; he muttered to himself. Curiosity was really getting to him now. He stood up, hesitated, then rushed to the bathroom mirror. &quot;No way...&quot; he uttered as he stared at his body. He looked just about ready for a contest. Even better, even though he&#39;d cut out all his fat, none of his size suffered with it. His biceps looked to be nearly as large as they had been. Thick cut abs were layered in front of his stomach. His skin was pulled tight against his body accentuating the muscle even more. <br />
<br />
His left arm went up into a flex. The muscle bulged. A clear cut between his bicep and tricep showed. Adrian marveled at the peak. Even though he&#39;d always had so much trouble keeping his arms toned, these looked absolutely perfect. He shuffled through his drawers and found an old measuring tape he&#39;d used when he&#39;d been on a bodybuilding stint. Then wrapped it around his arm. 17 1/2 inches.  About an inch smaller than it had been but without the fat covering the arm, it looked bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck!&quot; Adrian practically tripped over himself as he rushed back to his phone. He ran back to the bathroom and opened up the app. All the information was still the same. Though, his focus was on his weight: 213 pounds. All his frustration from not being able to gain more without losing tone flooded back to him. He held his thumb over the number. Then clicked it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little bit...&quot; he hesitated as he typed in 218 where the 213 had been. Adrian felt his heart start beating faster. A small layer of sweat formed along his skin as his muscles started to expand. It was a slow swelling. Each one grew just a little bit larger and more define. He let out a breath. &quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot; he cheered loudly. <br />
<br />
218 quickly turned to 230. His arms continued to swell. The heavy chest pushed even further out in front of him. His pecs were absolutely massive and impossible to miss. Meanwhile his waist barely changed at all. Instead the abs just grew more prominent. However, his shorts didn&#39;t fall down as his ass ballooned out behind him. The massive bubble butt pushed hard against the fabric. <br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s dick throbbed with excitement. His massive hand went down and gave it a soft stroke through his shorts. He peeled off his shirt and kicked off his shoes, as those were becoming a bit tight as well. He&#39;d always wanted to be massive. And looking back at him in the mirror was an actual bodybuilder. Not just some average athlete with a bit of muscle, but a full blown guy who could easily step on stage and make the crowd go wild. Even the slightest bit of movement caused the muscles to flex and bulge. His wide shoulders and thin waist gave him a distinctive shape. And with a 9% bodyfat, his skin looked to be just about vacuum sealed to his muscles.<br />
<br />
&#39;More...&#39; his dick throbbed at the idea. He clicked the 230 and changed it to 250. Muscle continued to pack onto his frame only making his shoulders wider. He&#39;d half to turn to the side to actually fit through doors now. Not that it would be too much easier as his massive chest and thick arms looked to be nearly as wide as he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yea...&quot; Adrian moaned. The bathroom he was in was far too small for him now. It didn&#39;t help that the size of his muscles also made it hard for him to move. However, he was far more focused on his throbbing cock. Each little tug sent another wave of pleasure through Adrian as he looked as his muscle flex and every vein bulge from his skin. Sweat dripped from his brow and formed thin layer across the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
With each stroke his heart beat faster. The sheer thought of his size would have gotten him off, but seeing his heavy chest and thick arms in the mirror was far too much for him to handle. He felt his body release and spray the sink and mirror in front of him. Adrian had to take a seat on the toilet to calm himself down. With how big and wide he was, he barely fit. He was out of breath as he looked down at his oversized body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; he smiled stupidly at just how big his hands were. But then he went back to his phone. Something like this was fun, but fun came in moderation. He slowly reverted the numbers back down to 220, and upped his bodyfat percentage to 13%. He was still a bit bigger, but not something the average person would probably notice. And maybe, he&#39;d change it little by little just to see if anyone would.</p>
