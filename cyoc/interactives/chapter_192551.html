<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now then, were going to want something that complements your hair my lady, as well as something comfortable in your condition, I&#39;m thinking....pink?, lavender?....oooooo maby gold!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex sighed and leaned back in her chair, she had been at this for over an hour now, she was scheduled to be crowned the second queen within winters end, but at the rate that the goddess of matrimony was going she would be here for three winters.<br />
<br />
And the princess wasn&#39;t exactly a big help either, constantly testing her confines, not that Alex would mind, she had truly taken to Lilly as her daughter, spending every spare moment simply talking and playing with her, caressing her belly to ease her to sleep at night, listening to her playing the moon strings upon the moons rise, mutch to Mystro&#39;s annoyment, but Alex took it all in stride, even when little Lilly decided to have a little bit of a tantrum.<br />
<br />
Much like now<br />
<br />
Alex took a sharp breath as Lillys foot wedged itself in her pelvis, refusing to budge, pressing her foot firmly against Alex&#39;s sealed birth canal while her head bulged out infront of Alex&#39;s rib cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright my lady, shall I fetch Marcus?&quot; Asked the goddesses.<br />
<br />
Alex waved it off, rubbing slow wide circles over her belly&#39;s surface &quot;no Mary, just the joys of pregnancy I guess, nnnnggghh....so what were you saying about the dress?&quot; Panted Alex as she held her gravid womb.<br />
<br />
Mary gave her a concerned look, but then shrugged and turned her attention back to the board displaying her different dress ideas and colours.<br />
<br />
Alex then looked down at her translucent womb, patting it&#39;s sensetive underside to get Lillys attention &quot;now what&#39;s all this about young lady, you promised to be a good girl&quot; said Alex at Lilly looked up at her, her large blue eyes so full of wonder and life, her eyes always seemed to dull Alex&#39;s anger, after all how could she stay mad at something so precious and beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry....and bored mama, wana play&quot; said Lilly with a pout as she crossed her four arms over her chest, now looking down.<br />
<br />
Alex was about to answer Lilly when suddenly the room became silent, Alex looked up towards Mary to fund her eyes wide, almost as if frozen in fear as a loud laughter echoed through the air, not a sadistic laughter or a ill willed laugh, but a laugh of genuine joy.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s material instincts kicked in as she practically flew from the chair and hid behind Rykas changing screen, it would seem either someone or something was coming towards her bedroom, and clearly they weren&#39;t invited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah dear Mary, its been too long, but then again it would be if you were cast into the ends of the universe, but so is the will of the allfather&quot; came a unfamiliar voice, it sounded light and soft, but with a slurred drunken side to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Loki, how are you back?, oh thank the heavens your alright, we have missed you so!&quot; Came Mary&#39;s voice, she sounded happy?, but something at the back of Alex mind kept telling her to hold off revealing herself just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to know I am welcomed home, I&#39;m yet to reveal myself to father yet, but upon arrival.....you know I could never resist our wine&quot; came the voice of Loki as Alex then heard something thump and then crash to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gods look at the state your in, five minutes, you couldn&#39;t wate five minutes to let your family welcome you back home from your punishment before getting yourself drunk&quot; chuckled Mary as Alex then heard her grunt with effort in lifting Loki from the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s OK now my lady, its safe&quot; called Mary, so much for remaining unnoticed, so after readjusting her silk gown Alex cupped her hands under her belly and walked out into view.<br />
<br />
Mary was knelt down at the bedside next to a teen sized god that lay on Alex, Chronos and Rykas bed, he wore sleek silver boots, with a thick black fur trim at the tops, a similar style for his kneepads, with nordic runes engraved in a circle on them, he had brown cloth trousers, with a dark green sash as a belt, with a large golden buckle at its center, a deer carved into the gold, he wore silver armour over his forearms, made if gold, with black leather gloves that only covered his ring and middle fingers, and the black leather also made up the sleeves of his torso attire.<br />
<br />
He wore diamond shaped chainmale accross his chest and back, with a bear pelt as a Cape draped over his sholders, the paws held in place on his sholders by two gold discs, a gold chain linking the two.<br />
<br />
Loki then groaned as he rose from the bed, holding his head in his palm before looking up at Alex, his drunk posture and expression evaporating instantly, he had pail white skin, a scar from his chin, over his lip and stopping just short of his left eye, his eyes were bright and jade green, with black runes under his right eye, his hair was long and black, scruffy as if not cut in a long time and two black horns that protruded from his forehead, both curving backwards over his head, reaching just over the top of his head he seemed to look distressed, in pain, angry, sad, there was not one emotion that remained on his face for more than a second.<br />
<br />
He then stood bolt upright, kicking a bow that lay on the fur carpet infront of the bed to one side as he then moved at brake neck speed and embraced Alex, she could hear him crying as his face was buried in her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your alive, your alive, I knew you wouldn&#39;t go, they said you were gone, but....&quot; Loki&#39;s crys of joy began to fade as he then straightened himself to look up at Alex&#39;s face, his gaze locked on her eyes as if searching for something, before he began to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.....your not....your not her......your not mother......your not HER!&quot;</p>
