<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the disappearance of her breasts, it appeared to Melody that she was changing gender. She knew most cake-people did; she had been unable to figure out why. &quot;This can't be happening. It's some sort of trick...&quot; Her voice sounded deeper, and she rubbed her throat. A lump had appeared some time during the night. She looked at her frosting-covered arms. They were beginning to become more angular, the muscles were getting more defined. A green, fur-like tuft of frosting spiraled up from between her new pecs. Her fingernails took on the same shade of green.<br />
<br />
Melody's rational mind pushed out her instinctual panic, and she put her head in her sticky hands as she worked on a logical solution to her very real problem. She had filed a report with Doctor Laura, so the institute knew of her situation. Melody had done so in anger, only later realizing that in filing the report, she was putting herself in danger. The institute could not allow a potentially infectious mutagen to spread among the population. They would likely have her apartment under surveillance, and at the first sign of cake transformation, Melody could be locked up in the storage freezers.<br />
<br />
As sorry as she felt for those people, she would not end up like them; slowly turning into a cake against her will, unable to help herself. Before heading home last night, she had grabbed her research papers and smuggled out various serums for a worst case scenario. She glanced to her two steel work cases. They were safely tucked into a corner.<br />
<br />
Melody pulled up the covers, and glanced at her lower half. Her feet, legs, and butt were turning bright yellow. Lemon frosting was leaking out of her pores, covering her. She jumped out of bed with a start, tearing off her nightgown. Frosting smeared everything; her bed was a mess. She tentatively put a hand between her legs. The sticky feeling made her sick. &quot;Nothing new there&quot;, she sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
A glance at the wall clock showed a time of 6:15 AM. She had nearly two hours before she would be missed at work. It just wasn't enough time.<br />
<br />
Melody had a sudden thought, and ran into her shower. She turned the hot water on to get rid of the frosting being generated by her mutating body, but it only made things worse. At first she thought she saw the frosting running down the drain, but to her horror, her hair had turned to sugar. The water was dissolving it, leaving her with a shiny, white frosted scalp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo...&quot; She sobbed. She fumbled turning off the water, running her green nails over her head.<br />
<br />
The shower's conditions seemed to actually harden the frosting covering her body. She didn't feel sticky anymore, but Melody now had, for all intents and purposes, cake frosting for skin. She knew the process was accelerating, and there was nothing she could do.<br />
<br />
The clock now read 7:10 AM.<br />
<br />
Drying herself as best she could, Melody shuffled back into her bedroom. She peeked out one of her window blinds. Sure enough, a black van was positioned at the front door to her building. Her suspicions were confirmed. After another hour, absent from her post, she expected her house would be raided. She would be taken away to the institute, not as an employee, but as another experiment gone wrong.<br />
<br />
7:17 AM. Melody didn't want to use her serums, since she had no idea what would happen. They were taken as a last resort. Her eyes darted between the metal case and the window, down to her hands, and back to the case.<br />
<br />
Fueled by Melody's anxiety, minor changes were manifesting all over, altering her in several subtle ways. Some made sense to her, but others seemed random. Her shoulders and jaw broadened a bit, making her more male than ever. Where the yellow of her legs met the white of her torso, yellow trim forced itself out from her skin. It tingled, bordering each of her legs and meeting behind her above her yellow rear end. Where the two ribbons met, below the small of her back, a huge yellow rose was beginning to form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; Melody's neck lengthened a little, and she was able to see the rose clearly. Her white ears also pointed and lengthened a bit. She had no idea why. She was starting to look like some kind of easter Bunny Cake. She flexed her feet. They had lengthened considerably; her toes had melted into each other, and all trace of toenail had vanished.<br />
<br />
7:25 AM. Her legs were starting to feel numb.<br />
<br />
With her new feet, Melody ran as best as she could over to the serum case, and opened it. She selected the one which, based on her research, would have the greatest chance of restoring human DNA. She had no idea if she was right... there wasn't any time! She thought she heard footsteps in the hallway. Was she being paranoid? Melody's ears grew longer. It was all a frenzy... She tipped her head back and downed the vial in a single swallow. She swallowed a second, a catalyst, as well. It might accelerate the serum.<br />
<br />
7:43 AM. Melody's body tingled all over, but her excitement soon turned to despair. Whatever she had drank was accelerating the transformation. Her white lips turned green, and the process converted tooth enamel to sugar. Two rabbit teeth stuck out of her mouth. Her ears finished growing. She looked like a half-boy, half-rabbit. A green frosting bow-tie grew out of her neck.<br />
<br />
The door busted open, and officials barged into her apartment. Melody didn't perceive it. Her legs completely numbed and she found herself kneeling on the floor, legs spread, arms out to her sides, hands flat on the floor. Her cake body was solidifying into a final, embarrassing position. Melody's feet touched each other behind her. Her back arched and her green tufted chest stuck out. Her neck was craned and her head was thrown back as green sprinkles dotted her shoulders, chest, and rabbit ear tips.<br />
<br />
As a final insult, a banana grew between her spread legs as scientists in gas masks readied her for transport.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don't do this! I'm not a cake, really!&quot; Melody tried to speak, but she was unable to.</p>
