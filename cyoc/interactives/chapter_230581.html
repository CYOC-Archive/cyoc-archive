<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ocean says &quot;What do you-?! ouch!&quot; he suddenly stopped talking when he felt a weird warming going through his whole body. He kneeled in pain, while he kept holding his stomach with his arms. &quot;What&#39;s... happening?! You must... help me, John! It hurts!! It hurts a lot!! My body is on fire!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was in so much pain that he didn&#39;t notice that his muscles were growing in all his body, at the same time his spine was lengthening and he got an extra foot in height in a matter of seconds. His fitting boxers now looked so tight around his thicker thighs.<br />
<br />
His already existing body hair was thickening and spreading further through his legs, armpits and crotch. Ocean chestnut hair was now even morevisible on those places. Oddly he didn&#39;t grow hair on his belly, chest or face, so he had got enough body hair to look manly but not to look disgusting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember when you told me I should get a dog so I wouldn&#39;t be so lonely?&quot; John said with a big grin on his face. &quot;Well, I preferred to get a different kind of pet. Thar collar is preset to turn you into a himbo slave! You will serve me until I get bored of you!!&quot; Ocean&#39;s eyes opened completely in fear and rage before he desperately tried to take the collar off his neck.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t clear if it&#39;s because of his desperation or any kind of magic, but he can&#39;t take the collar off him. On the contrary, his fingers started to swell and he lost control on them, like if they&#39;re getting numb and they&#39;re getting difficult to move. The same happened with his feet which suddenly bursted into a manly size 14. Five sizes more than his former shoe size!!<br />
<br />
Ocean felt very helpless since then. His arms and legs were su numb that he feared he&#39;s turning into a statue. They also felt heavy and it was practically impossible to move them at all. He tried to scream for help but his face began to felt numb too. It was reshaping into a more angular and manly form. Ocean can&#39;t talk but he was continuously whining and sobbing like a helpless puppy.<br />
<br />
John just smiled satisfied as he watched his brother pathetically trying to fight back but losing control over his own body instead, however, there was a place were he still had plentiful mobility. &quot;Let me help you, Ocean.&quot; John said as he abruptly take Ocean&#39;s boxers off. He smiled as he noticed the tears running down his brother&#39;s cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t cry, big bro, I promise you I&#39;ll be a good master.&quot; John smiled when he noticed that Ocean was getting hard down there. &quot;Is this turning you on? What happened with my jockish and overconfident brother who&#39;s always in dominance.&quot; John said before Ocean let out a long whine and tried to move a hand to his shaft. &quot;Oh, do you need a release? I could help you, but it won&#39;t be necessary. You are too horny that you&#39;ll cum at any moment!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ocean&#39;s tears were running down his cheeks while pain accumulated on his dick. It hurts so much that Ocean thought it would explode like a bomb and he would lose his junk. That doesn&#39;t happened, of course. But it felt like it was. Instead, his balls began to swell, growing from nuts to lemons to big bull balls. They look so tight inside Ocean&#39;s scrotum that its tissue began to painfully elongate.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems you&#39;re ready to shot a load.&quot; John said as he watched his former brother still squirming in pain. &quot;But it won&#39;t happen. Not unless I give you the order... and you know what? I don&#39;t want to.&quot; John saw Ocean&#39;s dick swelling and turning red. Veins popping out and swelling. It was painful just to see it. &quot;It hurt, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!... John!&quot; Ocean managed to say as he tried to bear the incredible pain on his dick and balls. The rest of his body has already changed into a big beefy himbo who could easily beat his little brother down if he could move at least an arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... I will allow you. But before you cum-&quot; John was mid sentence when Ocean&#39;s dick burst out like a geyser. Over and over again, cum was coming out from his swelled dick. It wasn&#39;t reducing, neither his balls. So, he assumed those are going to be their size now. As he did it, John began to laugh uncontrollably. &quot;I was going to tell you that your IQ will drop down if you cum. It won&#39;t change your mind or your memories. So, you&#39;re going to turn into a dumb version of yourself. Hahahaha!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;re definitely 100% himbo.&quot; John said and immediately noticed that Ocean can move again, but he was so dumb to be mad at his little brother. Instead he felt helpless and lost like a baby. And like a baby again, he started to cry a lot. His big schlong, acting like it had a mind of its own, began to piss on the floor around his feet. A minute later, several nasty fart began to come out followed by some shit.<br />
<br />
John smiled while he patted Ocean&#39;s broad back. &quot;It&#39;s ok, big boy. You won&#39;t have to worry on these stuff anymore. Your master will guarantee you&#39;ll be clean as much as possible.&quot; He looked at Ocean&#39;s discarded cloths in the ground while he got and idea. &quot;Those clothes won&#39;t be necessary anymore, but maybe a diaper would be more helpful since now.&quot;</p>
