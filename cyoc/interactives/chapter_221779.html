<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wyatt just stood there with his mind still blank on what he wanted to do. He wasn&#39;t even sure whether he hated what was happening or enjoyed it. Yea he wanted the shoe to be on the other foot, for Chris to be the tiny instead of himself but then his sense of fairness kicked him making him wonder why it was wrong for them to do to him what he wanted to do to them. Also they were still all friendly in a way. Yea Moth had grabbed him without permission but Moth had been gentle. Wyatt wondered if maybe he secretly wanted to be picked up by Moth and Moth had noticed Wyatt&#39;s secret desire. Wyatt thought about how absurd it would be if his friends had to constantly ask permission to touch Wyatt in a way that Wyatt wanted to be touched. Maybe it was just the surprise that caused Wyatt&#39;s uncertainty. Wyatt hadn&#39;t said no and nothing that happened was unpleasant. So were his friends really violating consent or not? Wyatt wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
The boys continued to measure Wyatt&#39;s chest, waist and inseam. Having his inseam measured while naked was interesting as Moth didn&#39;t hesitate to hold the tape measure right up to Wyatt&#39;s scrotum. The boys then compared their measurements to nearby charts to see that Wyatt was completely proportional.<br />
<br />
Chris then asked, &quot;What about his dick size?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt immediately covered himself in a knee jerk reaction to not allow it. But then his own curiosity relaxed him. He said, &quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;Of course not, none of us are gay. We wouldn&#39;t be friends with you if you were gay. We&#39;re just guys having fun.&quot; Then Chris took the tape measure himself and reached for Wyatt&#39;s cock. Wyatt withdrew his hands. Chris gently pressed the tape measure against Wyatt&#39;s dick and consulted the charts. Wyatt&#39;s dick was fairly large for a tiny.<br />
<br />
Chris then very gently stroked Wyatt&#39;s dick to an erection. Wyatt stared at Chris&#39; eyes wondering for any sign of love or attraction on Chris&#39; part but all Wyatt saw was a gentle friend. Wyatt&#39;s erect dick was a typical size for a tiny. Wyatt was a shower, not a grower.<br />
<br />
Then Chris withdrew his hands and they all stared at each other for a moment. Then John said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry. How about we get some breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;That&#39;s up to Wyatt. Is that what you want, Wyatt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt continued to stare at Chris, &quot;Yea, breakfast sounds good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moth pulled out a necklace that was weirdly designed. It was designed specifically so a tiny could ride comfortably on the necklace. It had a seat for the tiny to sit on and it had bars to prevent the tiny from falling out on accident but it was loose enough that Wyatt could slip in and out of it whenever he wanted. Once Wyatt was comfortably seated in the necklace, Moth picked it up and put it around his neck and they left to find breakfast.<br />
<br />
Wyatt kept looking over at Chris. He wanted to ride around Chris&#39; neck but he didn&#39;t know if Chris wanted that too. Chris did keep looking at Wyatt and smiling but then Chris would look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
As they walked, they looked at all the other possibilities for fun in Pleasure Island. The island had many possibilities. At one point, Mike lightly punched John&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;How&#39;d you like to be turned into a condom.&quot; Mike pointed at a booth that was advertising that very possibility.<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;Ha, ha, no thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys continued walking until they found a pastry shop. The menu had plenty of options for breakfast pastries from bacon filled pastries to egg filled pastries. John, Mike and Moth got pastries but Chris held Wyatt up to the menu and asked what Wyatt wanted. Wyatt asked for a cherry croissant and Chris ordered that but nothing for himself. They also ordered various coffees. Moth ordered an herbal coffee.<br />
<br />
Wyatt felt surreal standing naked on a plate with a cherry croissant that was almost as big as he was. All the boys watched him as he ate. He didn&#39;t eat much before he felt full but then he discovered that he was covered in cherry sauce. All the boys laughed and Moth picked Wyatt up to lick him clean. Wyatt said, &quot;Mmm, delicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
John complained, &quot;Don&#39;t hog him to yourself. Let&#39;s all have a taste.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Wyatt got passed around and licked next by John and then Mike and then Chris and then around the circle again. When they set Wyatt down, he was completely clean of cherry sauce but was not drenched in saliva.<br />
<br />
Mike complained, &quot;That was good but he&#39;s too hairy. He needs a shave if we&#39;re going to do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris seemed to ignore the complaint and called the waiter over. He then pointed at an item on the menu. &quot;I&#39;d like to order a sugar coated totsickle to go please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;Very good, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt wondered what Chris had ordered but then the waiter grabbed Wyatt and took him to the kitchen. Wyatt nervously wondered what they were about to do to him but he kept silent as they washed him up, then removed all his body hair from the neck down, then coated him in a sticky sugar. It felt almost like honey but thinner and not as gooey. Then they shoved a tiny stick up his butt and that tiny stick was attached to a longer stick that they glued to Wyatt&#39;s spine. Essentially, they turned Wyatt into a lollipop. When they held him up by the stick, his weight pushed him down on the part in his butt but his weight was also so evenly distributed along the part glued to his spine that it wasn&#39;t too uncomfortable. Also, he could still move about normally except for being unable to free himself from the stick.<br />
<br />
They then brought Wyatt out and handed him to Chris. Chris smiled as he looked at Wyatt. Wyatt felt bewildered at first but then he smiled back at Chris. Chris started licking his sugar coated totsickle and the boys left.<br />
<br />
They continued to explore the island and although they found the different options interesting, none of them wanted to give anything a try.<br />
<br />
Wyatt was frequently distracted by being licked. Chris would sometimes force Wyatt&#39;s legs apart with his tongue so Chris could lick the perineum located behind Wyatt&#39;s scrotum. (The perineum is the region of skin between the scrotum and the butt and between the legs. It is not part of the butt but it is an erogenous zone similar to the scrotum. In other words, it feels good when touched.) Wyatt had a continuous erection ever since being turned into a totsickle. It was like he was being edged, stimulated just enough to cause arousal without getting to the point of release.<br />
<br />
Chris kept asking what Wyatt wanted to do but Wyatt didn&#39;t answer. He didn&#39;t want to do anything except continue to be licked by Chris. Finally, when all the sugar coating was licked away, Chris asked Wyatt again what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Wyatt said, &quot;I guess I could use a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;That sounds good. The hotel has full gym facilities. How about we all go back to the hotel and sit in the sauna for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all agreed. As they approached the barrier between the hotel and the rest of Pleasure Island, Wyatt braced for the transformation back to normal. But it didn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I thought I&#39;d change back before we got to the hotel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike explained, &quot;The barrier prevents transformations outside the Pleasure Island zone but anything transformed while in Pleasure Island will stay transformed even after leaving Pleasure Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt asked, &quot;So you guys could keep me like this when we go home? I don&#39;t want that. You guys are going to transform me back to normal before we go home, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys continued their conversation ignoring Wyatt&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
Before entering the sauna, Chris washed Wyatt making sure to wash Wyatt&#39;s genitals. Wyatt finally got a release but it was hidden by the soapy suds. The boys stripped but put towels around their wastes before dropping their underwear so Wyatt still didn&#39;t get to see Chris naked. Then they entered the sauna and got comfortable.<br />
<br />
Wyatt was laid down on Chris&#39; towel. Wyatt could roll over and kind of stand up, as much as the stick would allow him to, but he couldn&#39;t sit down. The only comfortable thing to do was to lay down oh so close to Chris&#39; cock but still kept from it by the barrier of the towel. And Wyatt couldn&#39;t ask Chris to remove the towel because Wyatt couldn&#39;t let Chris know that he was gay. He just lay there enjoying his proximity to Chris.</p>
