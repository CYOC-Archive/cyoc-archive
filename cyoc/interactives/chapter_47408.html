<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*before I forget, this story is inspired by a drawing of Haukaiu by Jay Naylor which I found <br />
at &lt;galleries.adult-empire.com&gt;*<br />
<br />
<br />
As you walked through the woods, Devan described Kinzu, the main village of the Kinzu <br />
Tribe, to you. Most of the houses were log-and-stick huts with clay roofs to keep water <br />
out, while public buildings were constructed from carved stone. The largest building was <br />
their temple. You asked him what their religion was and he stated, simply, &quot;Christianity, <br />
what else?&quot; So these creatures had to have had communication with outsiders. However, <br />
they called God, &quot;H&aacute;iku (HAY-KOO).&quot; Devan and his family lived on a small farm just <br />
outside of Kinzu and his father was the leading supplier of wheat for the village who, <br />
therefore, made considerable money. As you approached the house, Devan said,&quot;You'd <br />
better stay here until I find out if you can stay for supper.&quot; He then ran into the house. <br />
After a minute or so, here came Devan with two more, older otters and one child otter. <br />
They rushed out to meet their company, but when they saw you, their faces were nothing <br />
if not shocked. Trying to remain chivalrous, the male otter introduced himself and his <br />
family. <br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; he greeted,&quot;I'm Tom&aacute;s (TOE-MAHS), and this is my wife Kendra.&quot; You accept his <br />
extended hand and tip your hat to the female. &quot;Obviously, you've met our oldest son, <br />
Devan. And this is our youngest son, Nicholas. Our middle son, Fisk, is at the temple for <br />
service. It is an honor to have you for supper as our new neighbor. I hope you will spend <br />
the night with us afterwards. I'm sure Devan would like to show you the town and it would <br />
be the least we can do to help you settle in.&quot; Not wanting to intrude, you gratefully decline <br />
his offer, but he insists and you finally agree.<br />
 &quot;I hope you like fish, clams, bread, and berries,&quot; Kendra asked. <br />
&quot;Oh, yes! Thank you!&quot; you say. Following the family inside, you sit and talk with Devan <br />
and Tom&aacute;s while the fish cooks. Once it is ready, you all eat a hearty meal, after which <br />
you thank Tom&aacute;s and Kendra for their hospitality. Then, Devan asks,&quot;Would you like to <br />
come see the village?&quot;<br />
You reply,&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; He leads you off down the trail again for another half mile. <br />
Once the city is in sight, he starts to tell you what all the buildings are. <br />
&quot;There's the village hut (which you later find is like a community center), and there's the <br />
marketplace,&quot; he points to a large, circular, white-stone building that sits in the center of <br />
town,&quot;There's the safe-hut (which is like a fort), and there's the main temple,&quot; here he <br />
shows you a large step pyramid with multiple otters running in and out. As you enter the <br />
village, however, everyone stops. Watching you suspiciously, they all slowly return to their <br />
chores, but you are never out of somebody's careful eye. Completely oblivious to this, or <br />
otherwise ignoring it, Devan leads you to one of many huts in the village. He knocks on <br />
the door and a jaunty voice calls,&quot;Come in!&quot; Entering, you see that the hut has been <br />
divided into two floors. The first floor was also divided, but not with a wall. Whoever <br />
Devan has taken you to meet is obviously the village medicine-man or something to that <br />
effect, because the side you enter in had shelves and shelves of herbs, liquids, books, <br />
and strange insruments centered around a large cauldron. The other side of the room <br />
was a sitting area/kitchen. Upstairs, you guessed, was his bedroom. <br />
&quot;Ah! Devan, my boy! How are you?&quot; exclaimed a large, heavy-set otter. <br />
Devan bowed to the otter and said,&quot;Very good. G&uuml;to (GOO-TOE), I'd like to introduce you <br />
to Steven O'Connor, he just moved into the human house by Big Rock Pool.&quot; <br />
Noticing you, G&uuml;to simply said,&quot;You shouldn't have brought him&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean no disrespect, sir,&quot; Devan said,&quot;But why not? Surely the villagers won't attack <br />
him!&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; G&uuml;to said,&quot;We don't attack unless attacked, you know the otter code. But there are <br />
certain spells placed on all otter villages that prevent humans from discovering us and <br />
revealing us to the world. Look!&quot; He pointed at you and Devan gasped. <br />
&quot;What?!&quot; you ask, terrified of what's happening that you don't know about. G&uuml;to shows <br />
you a full-length mirror. Looking yourself over, you find that your ears have moved to the <br />
top of your head and rounded off like theirs. &quot;What's happening to me?!&quot;<br />
&quot;You are being tranformed into an otter,&quot; G&uuml;to said,&quot;I wish there was some way I could <br />
stop it, but the spell is permanent. It was put in place to protect our secrecy, but even <br />
though you appear trustworthy, the spell does not distinguish. By tomorrow morning, you <br />
will be an otter.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I don't want to be an otter!&quot; you say,&quot;I don't mean offense to you, but I want to <br />
remain human!&quot;<br />
&quot;It's irreversable,&quot; he says. <br />
&quot;How could this get any worse?&quot; you ask no one in particular. <br />
But G&uuml;to answers,&quot;Actually, the spell may also change your gender or age, but those are <br />
only 50% possibilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; you burst out,&quot;Not only is my species going to change, but my gender and age <br />
could change, too?!&quot; You look in the mirror again, in just the time you were talking, your <br />
face already resembled an otter's and brown fur grew on your body. The transformation <br />
kept speeding up. Soon, you were fully furred. The fur makes your clothes tight,  and it <br />
must be noticable, because Devan says,&quot;Take them off, you won't need them any more.&quot; <br />
You do as he says and the changes quicken. Your hand and feet become clawed and <br />
webbed. Your fur pattern matches Devan's with dark brown hair on your back and limbs <br />
and light brown fur on your front, groin, and face. You feel pain at the base of your back <br />
and, looking there, you see an otter tail. Your black, short-cropped hair disappears and <br />
you are left with just fur on your head. Now you are an anthro otter, just like all the others <br />
you have seen. But other than the species change, you're the same. &quot;I thought you said <br />
my age and gender were going to change?&quot;<br />
&quot;They may,&quot; G&uuml;to explains,&quot;They may not. We won't know for a while, those side effects <br />
are delayed.&quot; You try to get used to your new otter body. Then, you feel something odd.</p>
