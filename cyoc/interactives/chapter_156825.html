<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Austin and Anna started to follow the path back to the park entrance, following the cheese crumbs that were somehow still on the ground and not eaten by the birds. This was the least of Austin’s worries, however, as he wondered if the park was going to do anything to keep them from leaving now that he was bringing a mermaid to the outside world.<br />
<br />
Anna didn’t seem to share her brother&#39;s worries as she looked around the park, appreciating the quiet atmosphere. It’s been weeks since she has explored the park’s insides, and she was a human the last time she was in this place.<br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s mind continued to wander until she saw that the Aztec coin and the golden rock, that held in place by the crutches and tape, were starting to glow brighter. <br />
<br />
Anna found this a bit odd, but Austin felt his heart sink as he looked around the park and saw something all too familiar.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man…”<br />
<br />
The park’s colors began to grow more vivid. The once solid shapes of the grass, trees, and water began to look… Strange, as if an artist painted these things with a brush. Upon closer inspection, Anna could see little brushstrokes making up the textures.<br />
<br />
“Anna, we need to get out of here, now!” Austin commanded.<br />
<br />
“Wait, why?” Anna questioned.<br />
<br />
“There’s something here that’s in charge of this park. To make a long story short, it doesn’t have a defined identity and seems to have powers. I remember an officer saying that this… Owner used to do magic tricks.”<br />
<br />
Anna raised an eyebrow. “Is that… Bad? That doesn’t sound too scary to me.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? We’re in an entity’s territory here. That &#39;s the reason why the police couldn’t find you. It can blank out the memories of those who try to find it!”<br />
<br />
“Austin, I get it. I know it sounds freaky to you but, as a mermaid, I can understand it, a tiny bit. It’s a magical being that has a home, and it doesn’t want its home to be discovered by the authorities. Simple as that.”<br />
<br />
Austin was baffled, he felt as if he and his sister were being watched by something. “You’re really sugarcoating that entity, Anna.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Anna rebutted. “I just think you’re overthinking it. If it was so dangerous, then it would’ve done something to you by now. I think it’s a bit… misunderstood, to a certain extent.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Austin said. “But still, this whole park looks trippy now thanks to the coin and rock.”<br />
<br />
“Did this happen before when you left to buy me stuff?”<br />
<br />
Austin thought for a bit before speaking up, “Yeah, it happened before. Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
“I think the magical items and the park’s owner might be linked somehow,” Anna suggested. “I mean, it’s causing some type of reaction right now. Just be thankful it’s not causing something dangerous.”<br />
<br />
Austin was about to offer a rebuttal until he realized that he and Anna were right in front of his car. Austin was so into his debate with his sister that he didn’t even realize that he was already outside the park’s entrance. The change in scenery didn’t seem to be caused by magic, just a classic case of people not paying attention to their surroundings. <br />
<br />
Austin opened the car door so Anna could get in the back seat. Austin went to his driver’s seat and started up the car. With no delay, the two were off to see their family.<br />
<br />
The first ten minutes of the hour-long drive was completely silent. The tension was so thick, it could be chewed on. <br />
<br />
Austin didn’t get it. He got his sister back and reuniting her with the family. It should’ve been a joyous occasion, but it wasn’t. It felt bittersweet more than anything, and he couldn’t understand why. <br />
<br />
His car eventually slowed down as the traffic around the roads started to get worse. <br />
<br />
Wanting to break the silence, Austin looked at his sister through the rear-view mirror. “Hey…”<br />
<br />
Anna looked at her brother and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Umm…” Austin said, trying to clear up his mind. “I’m really sorry for getting you into this.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Anna asked.<br />
<br />
“Think about it,” Austin spoke. “If I hadn’t dropped out of college, Mom and Dad likely wouldn’t have pressured you to complete college - You probably would’ve still been human if-”<br />
<br />
“Austin, I know what you’re implying, but I made my choice,” Anna replied. “I’m a mermaid, I can never go back to my old life. Once I tell the family, I’ll go back to the sea, and be with Eric.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, Eric,” Austin muttered, remembering how the fish-man tried to clumsily impale him with a trident. “Speaking of Eric, what do you honestly see in him?”<br />
<br />
Anna sighed. “It’s complicated, but I’ll just say that I live in his place and I’m happy being with him. I know you and him got off on the wrong foot, but he’s really kind and caring to me. I’m his and he’s mine.”<br />
<br />
“Oh…” Austin said silently. <br />
<br />
“Do you have someone of your own, Austin?” <br />
<br />
“No…” He said wearily. “I’ll be honest. My life hasn’t been that good… At all… Since I left home.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, how’s your life like?”<br />
<br />
Austin sighed. “Nothing much, really. I’ve been paying off my student loans and living in an apartment for about two years now, alone from everyone. I honestly have no idea what to do next.”<br />
<br />
Anna looked at him sympathetically. Austin could see his sister’s puppy dog eyes and spoke again. <br />
<br />
“Listen, don’t pity me. I brought this on myself. It’s just my life. I mean, look at you. You have a home, a man, and you get to live out your fantasy. In just over a week, you made something out of yourself.” Austin said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. “Your brother hasn’t.”<br />
<br />
Anna laid a hand on Austin’s shoulder. “Austin, I’m really sorry for not calling the family while I was in that park. I didn’t mean to drag you into my situation and make you feel this way.” Anna started to smile, “But I am glad I get to see you again one last time.”<br />
<br />
“One last time,” Austin repeated. “That what gets me, Anna. I want you to be home, like being-in-land home, not living life as a fish underwater!”<br />
<br />
“As opposed to what?” Anna rebutted, putting her hands on her hips. “Staying on land, paying off student loans, working for a corporation for 40 years, and having to live paycheck-to-paycheck? That’s not life, Austin!” <br />
<br />
Anna paused for a moment when she heard Austin sniff, just a little bit. She spoke more softly, “You shouldn’t have to live like that, brother. I want you to be happy. Please, if there’s anything you want me to do, tell me.”<br />
<br />
Austin stretched his neck and began to regain his focus, both on his mind and the road. “Well, while I was buying your stuff at the mall, I sort of thought about… Joining you as a merman.”<br />
<br />
Austin saw Anna eagerly perk up like a dog about to get a treat and laughed. “I know what you’re thinking, but it was only a tiny thought I entertained.”<br />
<br />
“Right…” Anna said with a hint of smugness in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Like, for real. I’m likely not ending the day sporting a fishtail.” Austin said with a chuckle. “You’re right, though. I mean, living in an apartment alone and eating chicken tenders for two years is… Awful. I should strive to do better. I don’t know where to start, but I want to have that spirit back. That spirit I once had as a kid who wanted to be an astronaut.”<br />
<br />
“You know…” Anna said playfully. “Humans have more knowledge of space than the ocean. If you become a merman, you would genuinely be more adventurous than an astronaut. Just saying.”<br />
<br />
“I will not be a merman, Anna. I’m telling you.” Austin replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
Anna pointed to one of the starfish attached to her breasts. “I have one transformation starfish waiting for you when we get back.”<br />
<br />
“Anna, I’m serious. I wonder if you’re planning to convince our family to join…” Austin’s voice trailed off as he realized what he had just blurted out.<br />
<br />
Anna grinned, trying to silently smile past the torment her starfishes were giving her. “Transformation starfishes can work more than once, you know.”<br />
<br />
Austin sighed, he didn’t want to become a merman, at least not yet, but he was glad that the mood in the car has improved. <br />
<br />
It didn’t take long until he found his family home and parked right in front of the house. The two siblings stopped and took a long deep breath.<br />
<br />
This was it. They were going to have “the talk” with their parents, only with the topic of merfolk and magical parks instead of sex. <br />
<br />
“Ready, Anna?”<br />
<br />
“Ready, Austin.”</p>
