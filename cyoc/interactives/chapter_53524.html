<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Show me,&quot; Cathy demanded.  There was a slight moment of discomfort before she laughed.  She shivered then and tugged at her clothing.  &quot;Why are you dressed up so fancy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi did it.  I think she likes guys in tuxes.&quot;  Dean could not help but notice that Cathy's nipples were almost pushing through her top.  She had changed from her comfort wear into a light, summery skirt that fell down to her ankles.  Her top was now a shear yellow blouse with long sleeves.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no real wonder.  There are very few fetish costumes for men,&quot;  Cathy said.  Her hands smoothed the skirt over her butt before she sat on the coffee table across from Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen said you were doing research or something?&quot; Dean really did not know Cathy that well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm taking psychology in uni,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'm studying sexual deviancy right now.  It's interesting how many fetishes there are in response to clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dean fidgeted with his clothing.  Being buttoned up so nicely was getting warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you take your coat off, Dean,&quot; Cathy said.  Dean complied able to do so with Cathy's permission.  Once he tossed the jacket away from him it vanished into the ether where it came from.  &quot;Most clothing is so common that no one really take note of it, sexually that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean nodded not really knowing where she was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there are a whole host of items that for one reason or another people just find incredibly ... arousing,&quot; Cathy continued.  &quot;I don't know if your internet searches go beyond topless pics of the latest pop idol.  But there are so many sites out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean blushed.  His computer had gigabytes of bikini models but nothing really much more risque.  This hot, older girl had piqued his interest.  &quot;What kind of sites?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well for women there are all kinds: eye-glasses, boots, high-heels, tight skirts, silk blouses, lots of pantie-hose.  And that is just most of the mainstream fabrics.  There are also sites for costumes, sports wear, latex, leather and that is just clothing.&quot;  Cathy paused to smile at Dean.  It seemed that her breathing had increased a little.  She wiggled a little in her seat and pulled at her clothing again.  Dean was starting to wonder if there was something about her clothing that was bothering her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about men's clothing?&quot;  Dean asked.  He wanted Jen to return quickly.  He really did not know what to talk to this girl about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides cross-dressing I have not been able to find that much.  Latex clothing and leather for the most part.  I suspect there is something about cowboy hats; I mean why else would there be so many of them on romance novel covers.&quot;  Cathy laughed and Dean joined in not really getting the point.  &quot;Maybe women don't desire men to fulfill clothing fetishes.  It might also be due to rather narrow clothing selections for men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean un-buttoned the cuffs of his shirt and started to roll up his sleeves.  Slowly he flipped the cuff over and over; flexing his new muscles as he did so.  His veins popped on his arms as he did so.  He mused about what Cathy had said.  There had to be a reason for why girls always wanted their men to dress up so spiffy.  Could it be an unconscious fetish that made them do it?  Somewhere upstairs Jen and Naomi were trying to find a prom dress.  It reminded him of the way his young sister use to play with dolls.  His thoughts were interrupted by a sharp intake of breath.<br />
<br />
Cathy was watching very intently as Dean rolled up his cuffs.  Her shear top and erect nipples let Dean see almost everything.  It was clear that she was not wearing a bra.  Cathy's hands were rubbing up and down her thighs as she rubbed them together.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some who find certain actions as sexy as clothing.  Some men like when women dangle heels from their toes.  Some women really like it when men roll up their sleeves.&quot;  Her voice was quiet and breathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Dean said.  &quot;I didn't mean to turn you on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... ahh ... it's a not just you,&quot; Cathy stammered.  &quot;But could you do me a favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you ... please ... just rub my nipples?  Please?&quot; Cathy thrust her breasts out toward Dean.  Her face was a mix of embarrassment, need and sexiness.  &quot;I wouldn't ask but they are really annoying me.  And I can't do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy,&quot; Dean started but did not want to go further.  To say more would be to refuse a girl in need.  Instead he just glanced toward the stairs.  He really just wanted Jen to come back and he wanted Cathy to understand he did not want to get caught in a silly situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Dean,&quot; she stressed.  &quot;Just for a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Jen, my girlfriend, is right upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, you should be careful of Jen.  She is a master of manipulation and torture.  It must be because she is a cheerleader.&quot;  Cathy's squirming became more pronounced.  &quot;She made it so that my clothing is touching me, teasing me until I cum.  I tried to change but everything I wear is too distracting.  I picked this outfit because it was the least clingy.  I tell you she really is evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you deserve it?&quot; Dean was starting to get and idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Cathy said coyly.  &quot;Can you help me, Dean?  Or are your pants too tight to take off?&quot;<br />
<br />
At the insinuation Deans pants indeed became tight.  Extremely tight.  As if they were cotton leggings that were suddenly fashionable with the girls at school.  He could not take them off anyway but his pants soon became tight enough to become almost painful.  Every muscle on his legs could be seen and it was difficult to bend his knees.  It would have been painful to wear these pants with the erection he was missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have the curse?  Fine.  Transform me.  Just please help me.&quot;  Cathy was fighting the urge to crush her skirt into sex and explode right in front of this boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cathy, your clothing will become a one-piece unitard, tight at the neck wrists and ankles but it will inflate so that every other part will remain three inches off your skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Cathy said as her clothing once again seemed to melt.  This time it changed from light cotton to slick plastic.  Her skirt split into two legs that cinched just above her feet.  Her collar closed tight about her neck and the buttons dissolved as her top merged with her pants.  Once that was done, the clear, blueish plastic suddenly inflated until it became a taught skin.  Her legs were pushed apart and her body was lifted off the table until Cathy's but seemed to hover on a cushion of air three inches thick.  About her body the, balloon suit remained three inches from her naked body that was now vaguely visible inside.  Cathy flailed her arms unable to drop them to her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not what I meant by help,&quot; Cathy said as she got up and started wobbling around the room.  &quot;I was so horny and you trap me in some inflated mascot costume?&quot;  Cathy was thumping the suit with her fist trying to push it in close enough to touch her own body.  The suit, thought flexible and filled with air, resisted her attempts to close the small gap.  &quot;You jerk!  You are as bad as Jen.  And the worst part is that I'm not wearing underwear.&quot;  Cathy laughed and cried a little in frustration.<br />
<br />
Dean also laughed along.<br />
<br />
&quot;You laugh?  I'm going to get you back,&quot; Cathy vowed.</p>
