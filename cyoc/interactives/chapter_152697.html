<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth’s POV<br />
<br />
Wait, what? I&#39;m not Elizabeth! I&#39;m David. Oh... right. I guess I am Elizabeth now.<br />
<br />
I slowly opened my eyes, finding myself in a small, brightly lit room. The lighting actual hurt my eyes for a moment, but I forced myself to keep them open, acclimating them to the bright lights. When my vision stopped being blurry, I took a good look around. The room was entirely white and sterile, much like the rest of the building. There was a full-length mirror in a corner, a table with some clothes on it, and of course the bed I was currently laying on.<br />
<br />
I looked down at myself. I was almost surprised when I saw how different I was. There were two large mounds of flesh on my chest, covered by the gown I was wearing. My feet, or what I could see of them past my breasts, seemed much closer to my eyes than before. My hips were wider, my waist thinner, and I could feel that my rear was a bit larger. I raised my arms in front of my eyes; they were slender and feminine, now. I noticed a wedding ring on my left ring finger. No denying it now: I was Elizabeth, wife and mother.<br />
<br />
I sat up, feeling the weight of my breasts on my chest. Curious, I grabbed them and gave them a squeeze. Wait, aren&#39;t these my mother&#39;s boobs? I quickly got my hands off them. Now hold on a second... they aren&#39;t Mom&#39;s boobs anymore. She&#39;ll never have them again. They&#39;re mine now. I couldn&#39;t say I was particularly pleased by that thought, but at least it made me feel less perverted. I put my hands on my chest again, feeling my breasts. They weren&#39;t very firm; actually, they were even beginning to sag. They still felt pretty good, though. In fact touching them wasn&#39;t a bad sensation. I dropped my breasts again: I&#39;d just swapped bodies with my mother, touching myself was not the most appropriate thing to do.<br />
<br />
As soon as I set foot on the floor, I could feel the difference. My balance was completely off, offset by my wider hips and the weight of my breasts. And yet I didn&#39;t fall down. I instinctively adjusted my posture. A few steps forward confirmed that my new center of gravity wouldn&#39;t require any adjustment on my part. The floor was cold. I&#39;d heard somewhere that women are more sensitive to temperature; was that why it was so cold? Then again, it was pretty cold back in the lab, too, and I was still a guy then.<br />
<br />
I took a look at the clothes on the table. They were the ones Mom was wearing earlier when we came in. I suppose that meant I&#39;d have to put them on. And for that I&#39;d have to take off my gown. I didn&#39;t really feel like it, but I figured now was as good a time as any: I should see my nude body, get used to it right now to make my life easier later. I walked to the mirror and took off my gown.<br />
<br />
I had to admit, Mom still had a pretty attractive body for her age. Or rather, I had a pretty attractive body for my age. I was right earlier: my breasts were beginning to sag, but they still looked good enough. I had a good, pear shaped figure. I didn&#39;t have much muscle, but I wasn&#39;t fat either. My body was almost completely hairless, except for my head, and a patch of black hair... down there. I didn&#39;t dare examine that part in further detail.<br />
<br />
I just stood there for several minutes, staring at my own mother&#39;s naked body, telling myself it wasn&#39;t hers anymore, but mine. When the sight of my new self was beginning to feel normal, I decided it was time to get dressed. I went to the table and took a look at the outfit. Just great... There was an ankle-length black skirt and a red short-sleeved blouse. Even the underwear was very feminine: a pink bra and nylon pantyhose. Not to mention the shoes, a pair of black pumps with, from my estimation, three inch heels.<br />
<br />
I struggled a bit with the underwear. It was a minor miracle that I managed to put on the pantyhose without tearing it. The bra was equally difficult, but a good amount of struggling with the clasp behind my back eventually worked. Then I slipped into the skirt and put on the blouse. I had to admit, it was actually not uncomfortable. I suppose I could get used to wearing Mom&#39;s clothes. Not that I had much choice. Then I put on the pumps.<br />
<br />
My first thought was that I&#39;d fall down, that my face would hit the cold hard floor. But I didn&#39;t. I started walking, instantly reaching an acceptable speed. I could feel my hips swaying in a womanly manner with each step. I knew how to walk in high heels. Was that what Larry meant when he said some skills would stay with the body? If so, that would help a lot. The shoes weren&#39;t comfortable at all, but I had to admit I appreciated the height boost. It made me feel a little less short. Now I understood why Mom wore them all the time. When I was done, I looked at my reflection again. I looked exactly like Mom. No one would ever be able to tell the difference.<br />
<br />
I looked at the table again. Mom&#39;s black leather purse was still on it. I guess it was my purse now. I grabbed it and opened it. It contained a wallet, car keys, a cellphone, a makeup kit and a few tampons. I shuddered at the thought of what that last item foreshadowed. Anyway, none of these items would be of any use to Mom, now that she was a teenage boy. As I thought, all of that purse&#39;s content now belonged to me.<br />
<br />
I walked out of the room, only to find that it led directly into the laboratory where the procedure was performed. Larry and Gloria were sitting in a corner, talking to each other. As soon as they saw me, they hurried over to my side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Elizabeth,&quot; said Larry. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not Elizabeth, I&#39;m David,&quot; I replied, almost surprised when I heard Mom&#39;s voice instead of mine. &quot;But I feel fine. Nothing out of the ordinary... well, except that I&#39;m a woman, but I suppose that&#39;s not what you meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be correct,&quot; said Larry. &quot;What I want to know is if there&#39;s anything not working properly. Are you in control of all your limbs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they work fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you feel this?&quot; he asked, before poking me at several spots. At least he had the decency to avoid my breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can feel this. Now will you please stop poking me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Is there anything wrong with your hearing, or your eyesight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I don&#39;t think so. I told you, I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything seems to be in order, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked around the room. Mom was nowhere to be seen. There was another door next to the one I&#39;d just come from. Probably where Mom was.<br />
<br />
&quot;David hasn&#39;t woken up yet.&quot; Gloria said, seemingly reading my thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you keep calling us that?&quot; I asked. &quot;You know who we really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it&#39;s also very important that you get used to your new names,&quot; Gloria explained. &quot;You are Elizabeth Mason, now. The teenage boy in this room is not your mother, but your son David. We feel it is best that we refer to you by your new names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I guess that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, the door opened. A teenage boy, who I never thought I&#39;d see from this point of view, walked in.</p>
