<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Tina had left, Tom gets his comfy office chair and a magazine and brings both into the examination room. He pulls the chair up to the table, on which Jared is still sleeping, and sits down. Tom looks over at the “Cub” and smiles as he sees the soft breathing of the little “animal”, unaware that he is looking at a human boy and that he made a huge mistake, instead, Tom feels happy and pleased that he was able to help the “Tiger Cub” return to “normal”. The Vet strokes Jared’s naked body, “soon you’ll be all okay again,” he says quietly, he then grabs the magazine and leans back as he starts to read.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jared is unaware of what is happening to him, one minute he is dreaming playing soccer with his buddy Todd, next second the scenery changes, suddenly he finds himself in a jungle, chasing some small animal. Even in the dream, Jared seems to not question why all of a sudden his dream had changed so drastically.<br />
<br />
Tom suddenly hears cracks and pops coming from the table, he looks over and smiles when he sees the “Cub’s” body morph, the bones and muscles rearranging themselves, “sounds painful,” he says to himself, “luckily I made sure that the Cub doesn’t feel any pain.” Tom turns back to his magazine and continues to read, but as the seconds, minute and hours tick by, the man slowly starts to get bored. Tom looks over at Jared and sees that the “Cub’s” hands and feet are on their way to become paws, ‘starting to look more like he should be,’ he thinks to himself with a smile. The Vet decides to play a game on his phone, so he takes out his phone and is about to open Mario Cart, when he suddenly gets an idea, “I wonder if I am able to use the App while it is already working on a transformation.” He opens the App and then the manual, after a while, Tom finds what he is looking for and he smiles, “I actually am able to do multiple transformations,” he mumbles to himself, “I only need to scan myself, or something for that matter, and start editing the stats. Once I confirm the settings, every transformation will continue in the background. Perfect, that means I can transform myself into an anthro Fox.”<br />
<br />
Tom wastes no time to scan himself and start to edit his file, “I want to be a red Fox,” he says, “so, my main fur should be a nice orange-red, the fur from my muzzle down to my crotch needs to be white and the fur on my front paws up to my elbows should be black, the same goes for my back paws and legs. My Tail-tip will have white fur, my eyes are golden and the pupils are slitted. Finally for my privates, I want to have a sheath and my cock should be canine, my legs should be digitigrade. Now to set the duration to be permanent and the time of the transformation to take two hours, and the transformation to be pleasurable.” Tom looks over the settings, satisfied he confirms the transformation and sets his phone down, ‘I should better get out of these clothes,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I won’t be needing them anymore anyway.’ So, Tom takes off his clothes until he is standing nude in his excamination room, no sooner did he discard the rest of the cloth he feels a tingle, like pins-and-needles, through his body, causing him to shiver. ‘I wonder what’ll change first,’ he thinks to himself, he then suddenly feels a tugging sensation on his tail-bone, then he feels as if a hand had grabbed the skin just above his butt, which is round and firm, and is starting to pull at his skin. Tom is suddenly overcome with a strong pleasure, his knees start to buckle and he has to hold on to the operating table for support. The pulling intensifies, causing the man to bite his lower lip as he starts to moan in pleasure, his 5 inch flaccid cock starts to erect and soon reaches its full 7 inch length. Tom feels a warmth on his tummy, he looks down and grins when he sees his Penis merge with his tummy. The man closes his eyes, enjoying the pleasure, he feels the head of his penis starting to change, becoming longer and wider, a knot forming at the base, while the skin of his Penis takes on the appearance of a sheath. Tom soon sports a cock which at least is 8 if not 9 inches big, looking down the soon-to-be anthro-fox grins and licks his lips, “dang… th-that sure got bigger,” he mumbles, “Tina will love it f-for sure.” Tom then feels an itching sensation start all over his body, and assumes it signals the growing of his fur, he then feels his feet pop and feels himself standing on his toes while his heel seems to lengthen. The man then feels pads grow on his feet, palm of his hand and fingers. His nails on his toes and fingers lengthen, turning into sharp claws, then he feels the changes move to his head as his ears start to grow bigger and pointier as they start to move to the top of his head. His brown hair gets a nice orange-red and, as his nose starts to flatten and turn black and moist, white fur starts to cover half of his face. Tom can’t help but giggle, the growing of his fur tickling him, his tongue lengthens while his teeth fall out and are replaces by sharp canines, while his jaw pushes out into a muzzle, bones snapping, cracking and popping as they painlessly rearrange themselves. Soon a Fox-man is leaning against the table, his tail swishing behind him as he pants, but when he opens his eyes, they seem to be fogged over and only one thought runs through the fox-man’s mind: “Need… mate…!”<br />
<br />
Jared, still unaware as he continues to sleep, has no idea of the danger while he himself undergoes his own unwilling change. By now his paws, arms and legs have been altered into the front and back legs of an animal, his tail-bone is still lengthening, already half the size it will end up as. Whiskers can be seen poking out of his cheeks, his face still human, while his head slowly changes form, patches of black and white fur are scattered over his body, the patches slowly spreading and his penis has become a sheath, his cat-cock tucked away inside. The half transformed “Tiger” is unaware of the horny Fox-man who is standing right next to him as he continues to sleep. What will Tom do in his state of mind?</p>
