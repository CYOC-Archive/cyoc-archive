<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reaching for the lamp, drake rubbed it, ready to make some adjustments. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there sonething you wish for master?&quot; Asked Beldazarr, unfazed by the current state of the bathroom or Drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there is. I still have a pussy. I wish..&quot; it was at this moment that suddenly, a thought inside of Drake&#39;s mind finally got his attention. &quot;Hang on, do I reqlly need to be male agqin right now? For one, that was without a doubt the best orgasm I have ever had in my life, and I doubt having my cock back would keep that level of pleasure. I have heard that women have far better orgasms than men do, so it seems almost certain to be a downgrade. Plus, if I want to, I could always do it later. Yeah, let&#39;s keep this going for a bit longer, maybe try for the full experience for a while, that way I know for sure I want my cock back, and not that I&#39;m just not use to being a girl. Go big or go home I guess.&quot; Thought Drake. <br />
<br />
&quot;You wish for what master?&quot; Beldazarr asked again, since Drake had suddenly gone quiet mid-wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Right, sorry.&quot; Drake said, suddenly coming back to reality from being lost within his thoughts. &quot;Right, so I got a pussy at the moment, but really that is it. I was thinking of trying out this whole &quot;being a girl&quot; thing for a while. And if all I have is a pussy, and while it is important, if that is all I got, I can&#39;t really say I am all that different from before. I mean, a pair of pants would make my sex indistinguishable. So, I want tits, long hair, a nice ass, the works. Basically, I wish I was the image of beauty and femininity, at least for an anthropomorphic dragon, and maybe with a more heavier lean towards human in the head area. I get dragons have snouts like this, but I cant help but think of how incontinent it will be to have this large thing when eating. Oh but can I keep the fire breath and long ass tongue?&quot; Wished drake excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, mistress&quot; replied Beldazarr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress?&quot; Questioned Drake &quot; what happened to master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress is going to become the quote image of beauty and femininity end quote. It would not align to your wish to continue using the word master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I guess that makes sense&quot; answered Drake, eagerly waiting to watch his new changes. <br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was that his snout began to recede back into his head, becomming a nornal human woman&#39;s mouth. The lips were notably fuller than his old ones, and were now naturally a vibrant dark red, as if he was wearing lipstick. A human nose also poked out, absorbing the two nostril slits, becoming a cute feminine nose, while keeping the increased sense of smell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, these are super girly&quot; commented Drake about his new lips. He also took note of, noting his new higher pitched, but breathy voice. It really hammers in I am to be a full girl now, she thought. <br />
<br />
Drake felt a pressure building in her chest, which started spreading down her abdomen. She watched as 3 rows of breasts began pushing out, the top pair easily dwarfing the lower two by 2 fold. Once her 6 tits stopped growing, she began started to feel herself up, having gotten very horny from their rapid growth, which left her having 4 C-cups with another pair of H-cups on top. Each was adorned with a very sensitive, 2 inch long nipple. Just by circling her nail around one of her nipples had nearly brought her to her knees. Her nipples, or I guess a better word for them would be teats, may be a bit too sensitive for her liking. However she figured it may just be because they are new, and that once the mental adjustment takes place, they wont be as sensitive.<br />
<br />
The next change began at her hips and waist. Both sides of her hips started gaining fat, puahing outwards, while her waist slimmed down pulling inwards, though maintaining her amazing abs. She felt her tail also start pushing upwards slightly, as her ass was getting larger. <br />
<br />
Looking in the mirrors, Drake thought that if she was wearing yoga pants, her ass would be absolutely amazing. Just the right size, not too big where it looks fake, or disproportionately sizes, while not too flat or tight where she didn&#39;t have a even bit of jiggle when she moved. She also felt her hips realign, now adding a perminent sway to her walk. Curious, Drake grabbed her ass and was amazed at the feeling. It was so soft, yet it would return to its normal shape when she let go. She felt that if she were to take a nap while using her ass as a pillow, she may never want to wake up.<br />
<br />
Next was her hair. It began to flow down her back until it reached a little more than half way down her thighs, turning a light beige color, which nearly was pure white, but not as glowingly bright. It then took on a nice glossy appearance as if she had maintained it perfectly for her entire life. It also contrasted her deep purple scales beautifully. Her hair then began styling itself, keeping her bangs, letting them frame her face, while finally resting atop her breasts, the rest of it styled itself into a half up half down twisted crown braid, with her long, pointed ears now sticking out under it.<br />
<br />
Finally, Drake felt her tits begin to fill with liquid. &quot;I&#39;m lactating!?&quot; She shouted in astonishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of couse, Mistress. There are not many features which are more feminine than lactating.&quot; Beldazarr stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, but doesn&#39;t that mean I now need to be milked like a cow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you wish for it to Mistress. Your current production rate is not fast enough to require numerous milkings a day, nor is it necessary to use a machine. For one, your breasts will spray and/or leak out any excess milk out themselves automatically, when you are stimulated sexually. Or simply pull on your teats to release the excess milk. You could even nurse a newborn animal, or let someone suck on them. As long as you do it once daily, you should never have an issue.&quot; Explained Beldazarr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I think I can manage that.&quot; Drake said nodding her head in agreement. &quot;Guess all that is left is to pick a new name for myself, right? Drake isn&#39;t a feminine sounding name at all. So, lets change it to... um... ah, I know, I wish my name was now officially Ophelia. And adding on to that, lets have everyone become fully accepting of the new me. Don&#39;t change my history though, I still want everything to be familiar to me. Ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It will be as my Mistress wishes it to be.&quot; Replied Beldazarr, bowing while slipping back into the lamp, somehow as if he already knew Ophelia had no further wishes at the moment.<br />
<br />
Now fully female, Ophelia wanted to try so many things, but first she had to let her friend know. She was meant to meet up with them later, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to push that forward if possible to allow her to explain things.</p>
