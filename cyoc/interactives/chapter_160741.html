<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided to try being a statue. He chose just regular gray stone. Awareness 100%. He found some other interesting options. <br />
<br />
He changed his horniness to 100%.<br />
His need to pee to 100%.<br />
He increased the length and girth of his penis, but nothing too disproportionate.<br />
He turned his age back to 12 as well. He would be a random 12 year old boy statue. Naked, and in the throes of his first ejaculation.<br />
Duration: Random.<br />
<br />
It would be instantanous, the moment he looked at himself in a mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; he said. &quot;Now to see if this works.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood up, walked over to his bedroom door, closed his eyes, and shut it. He stood there for a a few moments, with his arms casually at his sides, the opened his eyes. He had a body-length mirror hanging on his door, and he saw a very life-like statue of an unrecogizable young 12 year old boy with a calm look on his face, standing there with his large penis standing at full mast. <br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly felt the need to pee and to jerk off. He could see the chronivac behind him, and was able to read his last settings backwards in the mirror. He saw his horniness and need to pee levels increasing. His heart would be racing, if his body cavity wasn&#39;t completely turned to stone. It was already at 50%, and he began to really feel the need to just walk to the bathroom, which he tried doing. He couldn&#39;t. He was stuck! He couldn&#39;t move even a single inch, and every time he tried moving something, it felt&quot;numb,&quot; or &quot;dead.&quot; It was a very irritating feeling in his mind Everytime he tried moving an arm or a leg. He tried at least wiggling his toes, but they remained solidly motionless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; he thought. &quot;This isn&#39;t good.&quot; <br />
<br />
The feeling for the need to pee and ejaculate continued climbing. He was getting to the point where he couldn&#39;t take it anymore, but he was going to be forced to. <br />
<br />
His calm stone face became an immobile mask, hiding how he was feeling. He couldn&#39;t even move a single cheek muscle. His entire stone body just stood there calmly, holding him prisoner. He couldn&#39;t do anything. Couldn&#39;t escape. He just stood there, staring at his own nude body in the mirror with the chronivac in the background doing its thing. He tried distracting himself by looking all over his body, but his eyes wouldn&#39;t move. He was stuck staring at a face of a boy he did not recognize with such remarkable detail carved in stone. He could see as far down as his own penis in the mirror. It even had a large vein, carved in stone. <br />
<br />
But the chronivac continued upping his need to do something with his dick. He felt the tip begin burning at 90%, as a couple of small pebbles formed at the very head of his penis, and trailing down his urethra. Now he is stuck at what would be his climax. When it reached 100%, he felt an unending explosion of desperation rock his entire being. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, oh God, oh God! Lemme go!&quot; <br />
<br />
He tried to reach out to open the door, but the irritating numb feeling in his mind returned. This feeling is now hovering his entire body, in combination with his distress at the need to piss and ejaculate. <br />
<br />
The chronivac changed screens to the timer. It read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Random timer being set....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! What if it keeps me trapped like this for years!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the screen changed again, and he could read it backwards saying &quot;Random, set:<br />
<br />
&quot;Total time as a statue: 00:01, 00:02,&quot; and continued climbing each second.<br />
<br />
Underneath that, it read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Time remaining as a statue:&quot; and the timer climbed at exactly the same as the &quot;time left&quot; timer above it.<br />
<br />
Below that, was a set of instructions. Jeff could barely read backwards as it was. Doing so in paragraph form was that much harder. And with his mind buzzing with intense feelings, it was downright nearly impossible.<br />
<br />
After an hour or so of this intense suffering, Jeff finally began to figure out how to meditate. To ignore the intense feelings coming from his stony dick. He calmed himself enough to attempt to read the backwards paragraphs below the two timers. After all, he had nothing better to do. And so, he concentrated his entire mind to reading it. <br />
<br />
It was a set of rules regarding the timers.<br />
<br />
It read:<br />
<br />
&quot;When subject looks at himself in a mirror, the subject shall turn to stone. The subject shall remain a statue as long as he continues looking in a mirror. As long as subject continues staring at his reflection, the &quot;time remaining&quot; timer shall continue to climb. Only when the subject is no longer looking at his own reflection, the &quot;time remaining&quot; shall begin to tick down until it reaches &quot;00:00.&quot; The subject shall not be moved outside the range of the chronivac. Doing so, shall corrupt the program running, and all restoration may become impossible.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Jeff thinks. &quot;My parents. They&#39;re gone for the weekend! And I...I....can&#39;t....move!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff just stood there, continue to state straight ahead at himself. The words on the chronivac mocking him. The chronivac itself mocking him. The doorknob to his door, right there. With easy reach. But his useless stone arms are just stuck at his sides. His needs to piss and jack off stupidly intense. His literal rock-hard stone cock pointing at the mirror in an accusatory fashion. <br />
<br />
His mind goes numb with the intense feeling coming from his engorged cock stuck in its stony prison. But then boredom and a little forgetfulness takes over after another hour passes as a statue.<br />
<br />
 He suddenly thinks suddenly: &quot;I gotta go pee,&quot; forgetting for a moment that he can&#39;t. Statues can&#39;t pee. He tried moving, but he gets that irritating numb feeling throughout his body. He comes back to reality, and is stuck staring at a reflection of a naked statue of a boy!<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; He wants to yell. But his expressionless lips remain motionless, and his throat remained in stony lockdown silence. The word only banging around in his own restless mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, it&#39;s only been two hours! What am I gonna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing. Jeff is not going to be doing much of anything. He&#39;s just a statue of a random kid, and will be stuck like that as long as he is looking in a mirror. Plus an equal amount of time beyond that.<br />
<br />
And so, Jeff just stands there, staring at his humiliating young stone body for the next two days, as the sun slowly...ever so excruciatingly slowly.... Makes its way across the room and down the walls. He stands there in his dark shadowy room, unable to even sleep. The following day, and and following night after that.</p>
