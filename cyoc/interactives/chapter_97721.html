<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">           Jeff still wriggles and moans for someone to wear him as he feels colder and colder the longer he stays there laying face on the ground. &quot;PLEASE! ANYONE OUT THERE, MOM, DAD, JAKE!! WEAR ME!!! I&#39;M COLD AND WANT TO BE WORN!!!&quot; he mentally yells and physically muffled in vain hoping that his parents or his older brother to find him and wear him. Finally, he hears his parents car come by the driveway and then the engines turned off followed by the sounds of car doors open and close as Jeff&#39;s parents finally came back home from work. Soon he hears the keys go inside the lock of the door as it twists around to unlock it and then the door swings open. &quot;Jeff, we&#39;re home!&quot; his mom calls out to him but no response. &quot;Jeff?&quot; she calls out again. Still no reply or a sound of footfalls to greet them. &quot;That&#39;s weird, Jeff would usually greet us a &#39;hello&#39; in some way to know we are here.&quot; she tells his dad. He replies, &quot;He&#39;s probably asleep, or he went out to meet some friends of his without letting us know, again.&quot; They place their jackets on a coat hanger and take off their shoes and make themselves comfortable at home to rest as Jeff&#39;s mom goes on the family computer in the living room to check her e-mail and chat with her sister on a chatting website, while his dad watches the news about random things.<br />
<br />
       Meanwhile in Jeff&#39;s room, Jeff is still trying to call them out with his muffled voice, but no dice. &quot;MMMMMMph!!!&quot;  he tries once more but again, no avail, his voice is somewhat quiet and doesn&#39;t get Jeff&#39;s parents attention from the bottom floor of the house. All he can do is wait for one or both of them to come up to his room and find him wriggling, pick him up and wear him, but he wouldn&#39;t have to wait for long.<br />
<br />
     It became dark, and Jeff&#39;s parents ate dinner together alone, they do wonder if Jeff and Jake would come back, but they like this time together for once and make small talk like how they met, what they like and dislike, and other small talks that they did together before Jeff and Jake was born. After they&#39;re dinner, they decide to check if Jeff is really asleep or not at home and went upstairs to his room. Jeff then hears muffled footsteps climbing the stairs. He soon got excited, &quot;MMMFFF!!! MMMMM!!!&quot; he yelled, again in a muffled tone. His parents soon stopped at his door when they heard his muffled voice. &quot;Jeff?&quot; his parents said in puzzlement as they entered the room. It was empty with his lights off but, he was not in the room. The only light source came from his computer and the little red dot on his camera that is still recording. Only a pile of discarded clothes were on his bed, and Jeff (they don&#39;t know it&#39;s him yet) is still lying sprawled on the ground except for his arm on the chair. They turned on his lights to reveal his zentai/morphsuit form on the floor wriggling but not seen unless they get close to him to see Jeff moving a little bit. &quot;You heard Jeff&#39;s voice right Zach?&quot; she asks him. Zach nods, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s in here unless it was a recorded video doing his weird roleplay things or something. But, that&#39;s new on the ground.&quot; he points to Jeff on the floor as they soon walked up to him and heard a muffled moan and picked him up. &quot;Did he leave a voice recording for us to know that he left?&quot; Jeff&#39;s mom asks with a weird grimace look on her face as she looks at her distorted reflection on Jeff&#39;s surface as it jiggles thinking it&#39;s just a tiny breeze. Then, Zach, notices his camera on the desk facing his bed. He picked it up and stopped the recording and rewind it all the way to the beginning of the recording and starts to play it but calls Alicia to watch with him. &quot;Hey, Allie (Alicia&#39;s nick name), look at this.&quot; She then stands up with Jeff in her left hand and watched something impossible as their son turn into a zentai morphsuit in the camera&#39;s small screen. At the end, they saw his featureless body turn to the computer and fell down to the ground and hears his struggling moans in the camera and stops there. They then looked at the Chronivac that Jeff ordered beside his computer and saw the screen and saw Jeff&#39;s current status:<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff<br />
<br />
Gender: Male<br />
<br />
Previous Form: Human<br />
<br />
Current Form: Inanimate- Zentai/Morphsuit<br />
<br />
Duration of Transformation: Permanent<br />
<br />
Mental State: Normal<br />
<br />
Temporary Effect: Arousal<br />
<br />
Size: One Size Fits All<br />
<br />
Signs of Existence: Wriggling and Moans<br />
<br />
            Jeff&#39;s parents were awestruck as they look at Alicia&#39;s left hand holding Jeff, and heard his quiet moans, &quot;Mmmmmph...&quot;  (Wear me.... Please...) he also said mentally. Jeff&#39;s mom and dad sighed in relief, oddly not freaking out that their son has been permanently turned into a living, moaning, shiny gold zentai suit even if by accident, she and Zach are glad to know that Jeff is okay despite the fact they saw his transformation caught on his camera.... Just, aroused in his state. &quot;Well, that explains the moaning from the suit, it was Jeff all along!&quot; Zach said to Alicia. Jeff was moaning and whimpering to be worn by either one of his parents or his older brother when he comes back home. &quot;So, what should we do with Jeff, hun?&quot; Alicia asked Zach as he shrugs and then both of them look at Jeff. &quot;Well, I suggest we should wear him to satisfy his arousal.&quot; Zach continued, &quot;We&#39;ll fix his arousal problem later, if we can. But now, which one of us should wear him?&quot; <br />
<br />
Which family member wears Jeff? Or will they give him to their next door neighbor and Jeff&#39;s best friend and zentai loving freak, Lucas? <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And no, we will not sell him away just because he&#39;s a living costume, he&#39;s still our son!&quot; she said to Zach just in case he has second thoughts and he replies back, &quot;You know me, I don&#39;t sell things immediately without your permission.&quot;</p>
