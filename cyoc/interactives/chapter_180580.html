<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Kenneth was having his fun with Chuck, Richard the Guardian Bear was sneaking his way toward the construction site. Well, ‘sneaking’ might not be the best word for it, since the massively muscled bear’s enormous feet stomped heavily down the beach. After assuming his human form, he was still as huge as ever, retaining a thick pelt of fur across his chest, arms, and legs as well as his long braided beard. That being said, he longed to return to his true bear form once his work here was finished.<br />
<br />
After finding a spare construction worker’s uniform and pulling it over his massive build, he waited for the other workers to show up and casually mingled with them. Naturally, the other workers immediately noticed the massive new guy and struck up a conversation.<br />
<br />
“So, looks like the boss wasn’t kidding when he said he was going to hire a few new guys! My name’s Pete,” said one of the workers, a handsome younger fellow. “What’s your name, big guy? With a guy like you here, we’ll get this work done in no time!”<br />
<br />
Richard let out a deep chuckle and responded with, “Richard,” in a heavily accented voice, unable to say anything else in English but his own name. However, that wouldn’t be a problem for much longer.<br />
<br />
The other workers introduced themselves to Richard in turn, then they headed over to the water cooler to refresh themselves before work started for the day. Taking a big gulp of water, they all frowned when they noticed the fruity, sweet flavor of the fruit juice Richard had added to the cooler.<br />
<br />
“Is the boss replacing our water with Gatorade or something?” Richard heard one worker mutter to himself. “Well, whatever. Come on, let’s get going!”<br />
<br />
The other workers nodded in agreement, even though they each already felt a tingling sensation running though their bodies as the magic of the island took effect. Richard grinned as he looked over the half-dozen or so young men, already looking forward to having a few soldiers to command in defense of their new homeland.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Pete grabbed his tools and tried to forget the strange feeling coursing through him. However, no matter what he did, he just couldn’t concentrate on his work; his hammer kept missing its mark, his measurements were all off, and he came close to accidentally slicing his thumb open on a saw.<br />
<br />
“Damn it, what the hell’s wrong with me…?” he muttered to himself in frustration as he slumped down on the ground to cool his head. A shadow fell over him, and he looked up to see Richard looming over him, but for some reason he didn’t feel threatened in the least by the huge man. Rather, he felt safe and protected knowing such a powerful person was around.<br />
<br />
“You worked construction a long time, Pete?” Richard asked. Pete didn’t even notice that he could understand Richard’s language with ease, not did he noticed that he responded back in kind.<br />
<br />
“Nah, this is my first job. I went through training, but I’m still green,” Pete sighed. Richard sat down next to him and put a reassuring arm around him.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine. Maybe you’re not cut out for this kind of work,” Richard said. Pete was about to respond indignantly to that, but for some reason he wanted to hear more. “If you ask me… You’ve got the makings of a soldier. A warrior.”<br />
<br />
Richard began to run one of his huge paws along Pete’s chest, undoing the buttons on his shirt to expose his chest to the sun. His hands brushed one of Pete’s pecs, and Pete immediately felt it surge with power, and soon his chest had plumped up into a powerful eight-pack.<br />
<br />
“W-what did you-“ Pete began to say, but Richard gave him a stern look that silenced him immediately.<br />
<br />
“Hush, recruit. A soldier obeys his superiors, no matter what,” Richard said calmly as he continued to stroke his new recruit’s body. Pete’s arms inflated into massive biceps, and his legs grew thick and powerful as he squirmed under Richard’s touch. The seams of his pants began to strain until they burst, shredding his clothes and exposing his body to the island sun.<br />
<br />
Richard nodded in approval, but he knew his job was not yet done. He continued to stroke Pete’s chest, causing a thick pelt of soft fur to bloom across his muscled body, a creamy brown with a streak of white down the middle. Pete felt a dull ache at the sides of his head as he ears tugged higher and higher up his head, becoming a handsome pair of German Shephard ears, pointed and erect on the top of his head.<br />
<br />
“You’re nearly there, pup. Hold on tight, ‘cause now it gets fun,” Richard whispered into Pete’s new ears, which flicked and swiveled around to hear everything around him. For a moment, Pete could see Richard&#39;s true form, that of a massive bear, more muscled and powerful than any man who had ever walked on Earth. The sight made the recruit&#39;s cock spring to attention in salute to his new commander.<br />
<br />
Richard reached on huge paw down and ripped off the shredded remains of Pete’s boxers, tossing them aside and letting his erect cock spring out. His hand engulfed Pete’s entire dick easily, massaging and reshaping it like it was made of clay. Each squeeze made his cock grow a bit longer and more pointed, and the skin began to redden to a deep crimson. Pete could feel his balls twitching in arousal as they gained a thick coat of soft fur, which pulled up around his cock into a furry sheath. Richard pumped his hand up and down Pete’s thick and drooling cock over and over again, causing a thick red knot to form at the base of his slick and sensitive dick.<br />
<br />
“P-please sir… I wanna cum so bad!” Pete managed to grunt out, his tongue lolling out as he panted like the dog he was becoming.<br />
<br />
“Request granted, recruit,” Richard responded, squeezing as hard as he could and causing a surge of pleasure through Pete’s entire body. Pete blasted off rope after rope of cum onto the ground, panting and yipping in pleasure like a puppy. With each blast, a long and luxurious tail slipped out from the base of his spine, wagging happily behind him as his orgasm came to an end.<br />
<br />
Richard took a step back and took a look at his handiwork. Pete was easily half a foot taller than he had been before, and was rippling with strong and thick muscles. He had a thick coating of fur across his chest and down along the insides of his legs, but would still need a bit of time before he had his full coat. Likewise, his German Shepherd ears twitched atop his head and his tail was wagging behind him, but beyond that he still looked mostly human.<br />
<br />
“We’ll make a soldier of you yet, recruit,” Richard said proudly, making a grin spread across Pete’s face as his tongue slipped out of his mouth and lolled happily. “Maybe even make you my second-in-command.”<br />
<br />
“Do you mean it, sir? Really?” he asked, even though he wasn’t sure why he was so eager to prove himself to the strange man…</p>
