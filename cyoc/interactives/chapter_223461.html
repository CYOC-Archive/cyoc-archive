<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up and see that it is now around 6 pm. You can feel your stomach rumble a little since you haven&#39;t eaten since you&#39;ve come to this place. Looking down, you notice your brother/girlfriend is missing, but you can hear the shower running. Deciding you want to go out for tonight, you look through the hotel&#39;s guide for arcades, restaurants, and swimming pools in the area.<br />
<br />
While looking through the guide, you see that your phone has one missed call. As you get up to see who it is, you hear the shower stop and your little brother get out. Not paying any mind to this, as s/he would be a minute before s/he was ready to come out, you pick up your phone and check the number. What you see is your parent&#39;s number. You figure it was your mother calling to see if you made it ok, since she is always against traveling, especially air travel.<br />
<br />
You hit the call back button and wait while it rings. &quot;Hello,&quot; you hear your mom answer. &quot;Hey mom, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m just calling to let you know I got here, alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank goodness,&quot; she starts. &quot;You have no idea how worried I was. I mean, you told me the flight was getting in around 1pm, and that you should be at the hotel by 1:30. It&#39;s six there right now, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; you respond, not liking how worried she was acting. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t call you any sooner, but I took a nap as soon as I got here after a long flight.&quot;<br />
<br />
While this was being said, your brother/girlfriend had come out of the bathroom, but only a young little boy&#39;s naked body. &quot;Well,&quot; your mom begins again, &quot;just don&#39;t let it happen again. Oh, is your little brother with you? I want to ask him how he likes his first trip with you, I could tell my little boy was very excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... What are you talking about?&quot; you ask, stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, your brother. The little boy you brought on the trip with you on his birthday. Don&#39;t tell me you already lost your little brother there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh n-no, &quot; you respond, startled by the situation, &quot;she... er... he is right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hand the phone to your brother/girlfriend and tell her/his it&#39;s mom. &quot;Oh hey, mommy, what&#39;s up?&quot; s/he starts as the conversation between her and your mother picks up.<br />
<br />
You sit there and stare. You know, just earlier today that this 12-year-old boy was your girlfriend and not your brother. However, here you are, listening to a conversation between your mother and &quot;little brother&quot; like he has always been that way. But now that you think about it more, you are having trouble remembering anything about the girl you thought of as your girlfriend. You can&#39;t recall how she sounded, how you met, what she looked like, or even her name. Even stranger was that you were actually starting to remember a life with a little brother. It seemed the little lie you told yourself about her/him being your real brother had come true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Mommy, I&#39;ll talk to you later. Bye.&quot; Your little brother hung up your phone and looked at you. &quot;Uhm, big bro. Are you feeling alright? You look a little pale like you&#39;ve seen a ghost or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, I am ok. Hey b.. bro, could you give me a quick run down on how we got together? You know, just for old times&#39; sake.&quot; Your brother, still giving you a concerned look, asks, &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re alright?&quot; You nod to her, and he shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, okay, fine, what the hell. Let&#39;s see, I think we started our fun when I was about 7, and you were 12. We saw people on TV kissing and groping each other, so we did the same. After we got scolded by mom once for kissing, we made sure that our parents never saw anything again. After kissing, groping, and eventually french kissing, you came home one day and said you learned something new from the internet. I think I was 9 at the time, and that was the first day I gave a blow job. About a week later, maybe you ate me out for the first time. We kept going like that till I was 10. It was during the summer, and you told me you loved me more than just a brother and anything else. That night, I gave you my virginity. Does that sound about right.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded again. Everything he said seemed true, and every detail you remember very vividly. If all of this was correct, then somehow reality had altered, and you were now in a world where you not only had a little brother, but you had a very special relationship with her/him too. This all seemed really weird but very natural at the same time. It was then you decided that you were going to get to the bottom of things once you had some alone time. &quot;Haha, sorry to worry you, lil bro. I think I just slept funny and dreamed about something else. Maybe I need to take some time to relax. &quot; You finish right as your stomach growls again.<br />
<br />
Your brother laughs, too. &quot;Yeah, I could tell as you so stress all time. Whaddya say we get ready and go out?&quot; You agree as you both put on some clothing to go out. Once you were dressed, you walked over to your brother and kissed him deeply. Whether this was your girlfriend or actually your little brother, it doesn&#39;t matter as this was still the girl you loved. After you break the kiss, your sister speaks. &quot;Wow, big bro, someone is getting a little passionate today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, lil bro. Back home, we can never do stuff like this openly. However, here I can show you my love openly without fear of friends or family finding out, &quot; you explain.<br />
<br />
Your brother smiles and kisses you again for a short time. &quot;Well, this was the best birthday from my brother who invited me on this special vacation. I can&#39;t wait to come back here for some more experience.&quot; As he says this, your brother rubs your crotch a little. You know, later, you are going to find out just how this world came to be, but for tonight, you are just going to enjoy things as they are. With one more quick kiss, you both head out the door to explore the resort.</p>
