<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noelle shifted nervously as she waited at the bus stop with Ashley.  Ashley had taken her hand, and she admitted it felt good to hold hands with her.  Waking up next to Ashley had been a great experience.  Of course, it was quickly broken when she realized she had to go to the bathroom.  It was weird sitting down on the toilet to pee, heck, having a vagina was weird in a lot of ways.  She was intensely curious about it, but decided to hold off on any serious exploration of her new gender for now.<br />
<br />
It was her breasts that annoyed her the most.  Oh sure, they looked great, and touching them was a very interesting experience, but they were just in the way more often than not.  She was going to have to skip her morning jog- until Ashley helped her with the bra situation, they&#39;d just bounce around all over the place!<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t even sure why they were so large- and she was only 16, so if she stayed a girl (where had that thought come from?), they&#39;d get even bigger!  &quot;No more running for me, I guess.&quot;  She sighed.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door, and then Ashley came in, carrying some things.  &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I thought we could shower together.&quot;  She grinned, then looked around.  &quot;Wow, your bathroom is smaller than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That figures.&quot;  Noelle grumbled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, good morning.&quot;  Ashley gave her a side hug.  &quot;Not sure about having big tits, huh?  You know you could always shrink them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could, I guess.  But if this is what I would look like as a girl, I thought I&#39;d try them out for a day.  Plus, you said you liked them.&quot;  Noelle blushed a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, but there&#39;s no need for you to be uncomfortable.  Come on, let&#39;s get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Showering with a girl (as a girl) was another interesting experience.  Noelle marveled at Ashley&#39;s tiny, yet perfect body.  Ashley didn&#39;t mind one bit letting Noelle touch her either, though, when Noelle placed her hands on Ashley&#39;s small breasts (which elicited a soft moan of pleasure for the smaller girl), she spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, if you keep that up, we&#39;re going to be late for the bus.&quot;  Ashley almost purred as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you want some private time, you could always make a wish to get us to school....&quot;  She turned and gave Noelle a sly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot;  Noelle knew that if they started fooling around, it would lead to sex.  Sex as a girl!?  She felt hot all over her body thinking about it.  But no, they had just managed to become friends.  It was too soon.  &quot;Sorry, I mean, that sounds amazing, but..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know.  We need to take it slow.  Come on then, let&#39;s get you dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle felt very self-conscious wearing the outfit Ashley had chosen for her (after a quick wish to make Noah&#39;s old wardrobe into girl&#39;s clothing).  She had thigh high white socks, a pleated red tartan skirt that felt a little too short, and black shoes Ashley called Mary Janes.  She had a white blouse with some black ribbon thing tied around the collar- the blouse was just a tiny bit too short, and if she reached up at all, it revealed her navel.  Another wish had styled her hair into something called a &#39;long bob&#39;, which framed her face.  Ashley had applied a little makeup- subtle eyeshadow, and light pink lip gloss.  Oh and Noelle had to admit, her new bra did wonders for her- her breasts had been far less troublesome while wearing it.  The panties felt weird.  Comfortable, but weird.<br />
<br />
Ashley had pointed out she&#39;d have to keep her legs closed when she sat down- with the length of her skirt, everyone would see those panties otherwise.  &quot;Which is fine if you want that sort of attention, but I don&#39;t think my Noelle is a slutty girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
When she&#39;d said &quot;my Noelle&quot;, it sent shivers up and down Noelle&#39;s spine.  It was interesting how they&#39;d both just started using the name Noelle, without even any discussion.  Not that she minded, it sounded close enough to Noah, and it as a cute, feminine name.<br />
<br />
She did wish, however, she had more to protect her from the cold than a red blazer.   &quot;My legs are freezing, why couldn&#39;t I wear pants?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked up at her.  She&#39;d gone super girly with a black dress that had some kind of see through mesh that showed off her shoulders and ended just above her breasts (when Noelle had asked, she&#39;d been told it was a &#39;dobby mesh yoke solid&#39;, which sounded like random words put together), white tennis shoes with ankle length white socks, and her hair was being held back by a white hairband.  She was even less protected from the cold, with nothing but a white scarf.  &quot;Suck it up, girlfriend.  That&#39;s the price girls pay to look gorgeous.  And trust me, you are gorgeous- I&#39;m really enjoying the view.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blush Noelle got from that made her forget about the cold.<br />
<br />
On the bus, while the younger kids didn&#39;t seem to notice them, the high school kids were giving the two of them odd looks.  From their perspective, Noelle and Ashley had probably never gotten along well (though their relationship had to have improved, since they were living together now), Noelle had probably never bothered to dress up in her life, and, of course, Ashley&#39;s popularity had taken a sudden downturn at school.<br />
<br />
Seated in the back of the bus, Noelle saw Tim Bradley, one of her usual nemeses, glaring at her.  Well, she wasn&#39;t going to take anything from him today, that was certain.  Noelle smiled.  &quot;Timothy, do you mind giving Ashley and I your seat?&quot;<br />
<br />
He scoffed.  &quot;Like hell I will, you bitches can go sit with the little kids.  Ashley belongs there anyways!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle could see Ashley start to get into her fighting stance- though she be but little, she be fierce.  It made her smile, but she had this.  &quot;Ok Tim, have it your way.  I wish that Tim was a pretty girl in the third grade, and that everyone but Tim, Ashley, and I would believe that is her normal reality.  I wish that Tim, who will be called Tina as a girl, would act like a nice, sweet girl that does as she&#39;s told.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim seemed to shrink, his hair lightening to a dirty blonde as he did, his clothing changing into a cute white blouse and navy skirt.  Tina&#39;s eyes were wide as she stared up at Noelle in shock.  &quot;Now Tina, be a good little girl and sit towards the front.  Be a good little girl, ok?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tina mumbled something unintelligible as she grabbed her things (her backpack had changed into a pink My Little Pony one) and made her way to the front.  The other high school kids laughed at her as she made her way to the front of the bus.  Noelle then sat down in the back seat, and pulled Ashley into her lap.<br />
<br />
Ashley was laughing.  &quot;Oh my God, that was so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle rested her chin on Ashley&#39;s head.  &quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re going to have to do me a favor, Ash.  If I get too close to crossing the line, you need to say something.  I can do anything now...and you know what they say about power corrupting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley squirmed a bit, getting comfortable in Noelle&#39;s lap.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind you being a little bit corrupted.  But don&#39;t worry, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy in the seat across from them was looking at the two of them oddly.  Adam Blake was Tim&#39;s partner in crime- he was quieter and not as mean, but Noelle figured she&#39;d have to deal with him now.  Slyly she looked over at Adam.  &quot;I wish Adam was a cute freshman girl, very shy, and with a huge crush on Bobbi Prince.  I wish only Adam, Ashley, and myself would remember that Adam, now Amanda, was ever a boy.  I wish Amanda would quietly and meekly accept that she&#39;s a girl now, and not question how or why she&#39;s changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam also shrank, though not quite as much as Tim had, as he became a 14 year old brunette girl with long hair, wearing a modest dress and flats.  She was quite cute, though not as cute as Ashley, with bewitching hazel eyes.  For whatever reason, she now wore glasses and had braces.  She seemed to shrink in on herself, and ducked her head down, trying to avoid notice.  Noelle was curious what was going on in Amanda&#39;s head, but was distracted by Ashley  taking her hand and squeezing it.<br />
<br />
Ashley whispered softly.  &quot;Watching you do stuff like that is so hot.  I love you, Noelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle whispered back.  &quot;I think I love you, too, Ash.&quot;  The two cuddled a bit, and Noelle really wished she could kiss Ashley.  It would have to wait though.<br />
<br />
