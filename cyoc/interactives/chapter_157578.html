<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec the whole of the class just sat there, bored, but then half way through he found himself paying more attention not to the lesson, but to the subtle signals being put out there by Ms. Fresne. She was really making it obvious to him at least that she wanted some from him after class. Alec bit a slightly thicker lip as he sat there listening to her - obviously uninterested - talking about some old English dude and his turns of phrase. Usually Alec would be all about this, but today he was feeling just bored.<br />
<br />
He grinded his glutes against the chair, trying to find a good spot for his ass in these tiny things, and he swore that he needed to not work that out quite so much. Made sitting still a really big challenge.<br />
<br />
Class could not have ended fast enough. He noted some of the students seemed to be giving him odd looks. It seemed the few black students were eyeing him oddly. He usually would make sure they didn&#39;t look his way, but this time he figured he had more on his plate. Like the hottie teacher who was waiting near the back.<br />
<br />
Once everyone else was out, Ms. Fresne went to the door and blithely turned the card on the door to indicate her room was closed now, followed by locking the door. She then turned to look at Alec, who was now smirking and pressing a hand on to his desk. She approached him and gripped his collar lightly, &quot;Has someone been working out more lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe,&quot; Alec said, &quot;You know me. I love the gym, and I love looking good. I could say the same &#39;bout you...hottie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec didn&#39;t usually talk that way, but today he was feeling daring.<br />
<br />
And it seemed it was the right move, and Ms. Fresne gestured for him, &quot;Shirts off in my classroom, big guy. Let&#39;s get familiarized with your gym honed musculature...&quot; She was really into him going by that blush and perverted grin. This was an encounter that was never supposed to occur, but that only made the two people engaging in it even more excited.<br />
<br />
Alec for his part quickly shed his shirt and flexed his biceps and then turned to flare his back at her. She cooed and quickly took off her shirt and left herself in her bra, feeling up his muscular back...and then Alec gasped as he felt her touch his ass. He gasped several more times as she slapped it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm! Mmm! Ms. Fresne...! Fuck! My ass is sensitive today, jeez, ya want me to cum too soon?&quot; He said in a slightly teasing tone.<br />
<br />
She pulled him toward her desk, and said, &quot;I trust you to be mature enough to keep control over yourself.&quot; And then Alec simply nodded and pulled his way too tight pants off, walking over and letting her have him.<br />
<br />
The first hint at something happening was when she pulled his boxers off, showing his cock...and how oddly caramel shaded it was. Alec almost flipped his lid at that...but then quieted down when Ms. Fresne took it into her mouth. Her skilled tongue and mouth on him shut him up every time. Ms. Fresne reduced the cocky white boy to moaning and groaning as he literally had his pleasure exist in the palm of her hand.<br />
<br />
Muscles tensed and flexed as he pressed his hands against the whiteboard and the desk beside him, gritting teeth tightly in a slightly stronger jawline. Alec tried to say something clever and erotic, but could only manage a moan and a strong grunt. She was really fucking good at this, and he really bought that she probably was used to this sort of relationship. And he wasn&#39;t gonna ruin it for himself by tellin&#39; anybody.<br />
<br />
Alec felt his body becoming slick with sweat and he knew it wouldn&#39;t be long now...but then her mouth was off of him, and she was taking off her pants and panties both, letting him see the slick and shaved pussy that he&#39;d known for a while. Alec had at first almost complained she didn&#39;t finish him off, but seeing that, he was more than pleased and assuaged of his complaints. Heading over, Alec started to fuck her, slow, easing it in there first and then letting himself feel how damn wet she was.<br />
<br />
He ran a hand through his hair and slapped his own ass, damn but he felt like a stud today. &quot;Ohh! It&#39;s like fucking one of those black boys...&quot; She gasped, and Alec almost felt shocked, wanted to stop almost...almost. But then looking down at her, he shrugged and decided she just wasn&#39;t used to his girth and strength. Fuck, she&#39;d learn just how good a white boy like him could do these things. Because uhh, that&#39;s...that&#39;s what he was.<br />
<br />
Alec kept going, feeling his cock, raw and sensitive, pushing into her moist depths, her pussy was so fucking tight but so fucking wet. It was perfect! Alec groaned and knew that just from the BJ earlier and this now, he was gonna cum soon. He gripped tight on her hips and pistoned into her roughly. She appreciated this quite a lot, moaning and almost screaming outloud from how it felt on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh! Alec! You fucking stud!&quot; Her screaming that really brought him to the height of climax;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh you sexy bitch! I&#39;m cumming! I&#39;m...I&#39;m...FUUUUCK!&quot; He humped a few more times as he felt the moment of climax hit him, the sensations persisting far longer than they usually did. He had never felt this good, even with his sexy teacher. He groaned and looked down at her. His tan looked slightly darker from the sheen of sweat on him. As he eased out of her, he almost fell over from the sheer intensity. Alec knew he&#39;d need a shower before long.<br />
<br />
After all, couldn&#39;t give away the game.<br />
<br />
So he got dressed once he wiped off enough of the sweat, and bid farewell to the booty call. He felt a nagging sensation in the back of his head of the fact she likened fucking him to fucking one of the black guys, but then he just figured she probably spoke from some sort of pornographic expectation. So he dismissed the idea, and then went about heading to the locker rooms to shower. Sure he&#39;d be late to his next class. But it was not a very important one, more or less just a filler.<br />
<br />
As he entered the locker room, Alec looked around and figured he could both take stock of his appearance in here and get his shower done...</p>
