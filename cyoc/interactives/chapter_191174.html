<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In the first part of this Cabin in the Woods story, I dramatically undershot how many students were likely to be on the boy&#39;s bus by saying twenty-plus.  Looking into it more deeply, high school teams may have as many as 99 students, unlimited other than by how many numbers can be on jerseys. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><em>Not so long ago... ———————————————</em><br />
<br />
Christopher jumped a bit as the wide, young oak tree hit onto the pavement, just a ways behind the girl&#39;s bus as the caravan pressed forward around the curve of the park road.  &quot;I think it&#39;s falling across the road—&quot; he trailed off, watching it fall over.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; he nodded, watching it land.<br />
<br />
The white-haired young man was paying no attention to the tan-skinned boy next to him who was staring intently into the image on his phone.  The blue eyes of Christopher caught sight of the porn, and swatter him on the shoulder.  &quot;Dude!&quot; he said.  &quot;Put that <i>away.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I know this is the closest you&#39;ll ever get,&quot; remarked Harry with a smirk.  &quot;But, seriously chill... it&#39;s just—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...against school rules?&quot; Christopher finished, guessing the end of the sentence.  Shaking his head, he ran a hand through his pure white hair and turned to look back out the back window.<br />
<br />
&quot;...what your parents installed a site-blocker for?&quot; asked Ahmed from in front of them.  His brown eyes looked towards Harry&#39;s phone as he shook his head, his shaggy black hair swaying as he did.  His dark complexion turned to glance at Eric who was taking note as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;...none of our business?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or how about &#39;...not a problem&#39; if you put it away now,&quot; someone else replied.<br />
<br />
Harry grumbled.  &quot;This is a load of <b>[bull]</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>[Bull]</b>!?&quot; demanded Lukas.  &quot;Coach Banks said the next time he caught you breaking school code on school grounds, he&#39;d have to sack you!  If he doesn&#39;t, that could be his job... and I, for one, want Banks coaching my little bruder in two years so knock it off, and swipe that shit off your screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus clapped his hands together from a few seats in front of them.  &quot;Alright, <b>[Sheep]</b>-le,&quot; he called out loudly, getting everyone&#39;s attention.  His sky-blue eyes looked up and down the aisle as he spoke.  He was one of the few student of fifty who sat alone in his seat with just his backpack next to him. &quot;Everyone keep your eyes out for a turn so we can get out of this place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; remarked Christopher suddenly from the back of the bus.<br />
<br />
Hopping over from his seat to the furtherest back seat on his side of the isle, opposite Christopher and Harry in theirs, Francis looked out the back of the bus.  &quot;<b>[Rabbit]</b>, coming through,&quot; he remarked, and no one batted an eye.  Twice, as a Freshman, Francis had hurdled someone on the opposing team complete with air to spare, landing on his feet and running to the Endzone.  Even cursed, this name would stick.  &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it, <b>[jackass]</b>,&quot; the boy sitting next to him remarked.<br />
<br />
Christopher smiled.  &quot;I can see the girls practicing cheers!  Probably trying to drown-out the rain,&quot; he said.  Waiting until the end of their current cheer where he knew the line, the young man raised his arms and yelled &quot;Washington <b>[Wolves]</b>!&quot;  Lifting his head back, he howled like they do when they would break onto the field.  They might not ever run onto the green again, but howl... howling seemed rather likely.<br />
<br />
<em>Barely not the present... ———————————————</em><br />
<br />
Someone had yelled &#39;Gun&#39; outside, but Eddie didn&#39;t care.  He hadn&#39;t joined in the cheer, nor had he said any other animal name just yet, and he was getting the <i>fuck</i> off this literal <i>fucking bus</i>.  There was an unspoken tension there in the air as those who were not yet affected fully by the curse by naming an animal—and a few who were—took Eddie&#39;s movement as leadership in this moment.<br />
<br />
The obsidian-skinned kid in the number twelve jersey, the quarterback, quickly exited the bus with a flood of almost half the remaining students.  He stutter-stepped when he saw Officer Dowd eyeballing him, and he purposefully stepped off that last step in a direction that would put him behind Coach Banks, Andy, and James.  Twenty other students followed, not everyone going in the same direction.<br />
<br />
In the next moment, Officer Dowd rushed onto the bus.  &quot;What&#39;s he doing!?&quot; Eddie called out, watching man with a gun run onto the bus he&#39;d just left.  &quot;Is he going to <i>shoot</i> someone?&quot; the black youth screamed towards the coach.  In the next moment, Andrew was following after Dowd onto the bus.<br />
<br />
<em>An eternity of seconds later... ———————————————</em><br />
<br />
Just at the base of the steps, almost off the bus, Officer Dowd was turning around to face Assistant Coach Farminga.  &quot;Off!&quot; the nineteen-year-old demanded even while the cop still had his gun out.  The police officer wasn&#39;t doing as directed.  Andrew&#39;s lips curled back, his lips blackening as they pulled back from new, sharp wolf teeth with noticeable fangs.  “Get out of the bus, now!” he all but roared, a growl digging itself out of his throat as he commanded <i>everyone</i> still left on board.<br />
<br />
Seeing wolf teeth, the pig backed up off the bus, gun-hand now shaking.  Andrew had had enough.  This was a dangerous situation, and somehow familiar.  Stressful.  Everyone left the bus except one person.  &quot;Christopher, I swear to—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do!&quot; said Chris, his tone whiney.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get.  Off.  The—&quot; Andrew began again, but the linebacker stood up.  His long white tail hung down between his legs showing what Andy took as a sign of wolf deference without thinking about it.  The more obvious problem became apparent, though, and Andrew met him half way.<br />
<br />
The big burly guy had two orange-sized furry testicles he was struggling to shove back down into his blue jeans.  Sitting atop them was vermillion rocket of a wolf cock, bigger around an in length than even the young man&#39;s forearm.  It was softening, sure, but it was cartoonishly big at the moment and stood out starkly against the cum that coated him as if someone had tossed white paint all over his body.<br />
<br />
Andrew carefully touched Christopher&#39;s length, reaching up with his other hand to pull up his shirt from the bottom. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Chris asked, most of his senses returned, but fear in his voice by how Andrew was touching him.  Would this be the start of something new?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Hyper,&quot; Andrew said.  &quot;Help me get this shirt over your absolutely massive lupine dong,&quot; he said, an absurd sentence in his mind that slowly went from amused to sexual by the time all the words escaped his black lips.  &quot;Everyone&#39;ll see the outline, but it&#39;s better than nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher pulled up his formerly black shirt, lifting the edge of it so that all but the very tip was covered.  That pointed red end was apparent just under Christopher&#39;s chin, above the neckline of the shirt.  Signing, Andrew reached under the linebacker&#39;s white furred balls and forcibly pushed them down into his pants.  They both fumbled their hands together for a moment as Chris had to use the last notch of his belt to hold his pants in tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is uncomfortable,&quot; Christopher said, sounding almost normal.<br />
<br />
Andrew licked his fingers, then caught himself and wiped his hands on his pants.  &quot;At least you&#39;re still all guy,&quot; he said without any idea why those words escaped him.  <i>Was that an invitation?</i> he internally asked himself.  <i>It better not be...</i><br />
<br />
Turning around, he hiked up his pants, his black tail wagging back and forth behind him.  Unaware there was a slight bulge underneath his tail at his slightly more round ass that Christopher took note of.  As Andy resisted the urge, the black lips and teeth faded back to human, shifting his body to as it had been two minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
Without ejaculation, all transformations were temporary.  No one knew that yet, but it was important to keep in mind.  While any forward progress in transformation to a hybrid state would maintain, it could all regress if urges could be resisted.<br />
<br />
Christopher followed Andrew off the bus.  &quot;Now—&quot; they heard Coach Banks begin as the last person exited the bus.  &quot;—tell me what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fifty football players all stood around the front of the bus, with none of the transformed ones speaking first... not even Andy.  &quot;Guys.  This is serious,&quot; implored the coach.  &quot;Also, put the gun away,&quot; Thaddeus Banks, a black man, said to Officer Dowd.  &quot;This is the last time someone better need to say it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or else what?&quot; the cop asked sternly as the cheerleaders and chaperones started joining the crowd, wanting to know what was up.  It was a simple question of threat and intent.  Did anyone want to push the cop with his gun drawn?<br />
<br />
The answer came after more than one student growled and someone responded, in a rumbled tone: &quot;Eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping,&quot; Andy said, looking over at Ted, who he was relatively sure said the line as he was the only face he couldn&#39;t read right then.  His gray hoodie was plastered in white cum, his face concealed behind the tightly pulled hood.  &quot;Ted,&quot; Andy said, another feeling of deja vu for seemingly the fifth time in the last hour.  &quot;Ted... show me your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
There it was again... Andrew in a role of leadership, commanding another wolf.  And wolf he was.  As Ted loosened his strings to his hoodie, it fell away from his face.  And what a face.  Andrew was a high-contrast, black and white furred timber wolf in the face, though still with his light brown human eyes.  Everyone next to him took a step back, many bumping into others as they did.  His hair mixed with fur into his natural black as it went down the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
Everyone—and I cannot stress this enough—stared at Ted.<br />
<br />
Eventually the silence was broken by Andrew.  &quot;OK, so.  Like I said over the walkie—&quot; the assistant coach said, turning to face the actual coach, &quot;—this place is super-cursed.&quot;  A lot of the crowd just nodded while many of he adults behind Dowd were talking amongst themselves.  &quot;And it&#39;s clearly sexual in nature... or, like, sex sets it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sex did—&quot; Coach Banks begins to ask Andy, but stops as he looked Andrew up and down.  &quot;Nevermind... I don&#39;t want to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have to figure this out,&quot; remarked Harry, his long cow tail behind held around his front in his hands.  &quot;And we should get out of the rain,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; Ted said, drawing eyes back towards him.  &quot;You know I have problems, but being gay isn&#39;t one of them—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with being gay, Ted,&quot; remarked someone from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>My point being—&quot;</i> he said to the voice, &quot;I just gave Christopher a blowjob, and I don&#39;t like guys that way,&quot; he explained.  &quot;All the way to his... thick knot,&quot; Ted added, unnecessarily.  His eyes shifted over to Chris, as did everyone else&#39;s.  It was at that point hiding the shape of his still softening giant cock became impossible as it started to harden once again, the tip re-appearing at the neckline.<br />
<br />
James blinked, mouth dropping open.  &quot;How?&quot; Andrew and others looked at James.  &quot;No, I&#39;m serious,&quot; he said, pointing at the red tip.  &quot;If you slapped someone with that thing you&#39;d send them to the hospital.  How would you even get that down your—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this really the time?&quot; Coach Banks asked.<br />
<br />
James had his hands down at his sides.  &quot;Sorry... I just.  I&#39;m dwelling on it real hard for some reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded.  &quot;That&#39;s sort of what happened to me when—&quot; Interrupted again... he watched as Ted began to open his muzzle wide.  Wider and Wider still, revealing a saliva-covered pink tunnel that had his uvula at the end of it.  Ted made a fist and then easily inserted it in his mouth with room to spare.  &quot;Whao,&quot; Andy said, suddenly a little harder than a moment ago.  He wasn&#39;t the only one in the crowed either.  &quot;Asked and answered...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted frowned.  &quot;In the moment, I remember thinking... I wish it would fit... all of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew latched onto that.  &quot;I may have directed my curse in the moment too,&quot; he realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, me too,&quot; and a number of other affirmatives all repeated softly in the crowd.<br />
<br />
Coach Banks turned to face Andrew.  &quot;I really wish you wouldn&#39;t call this a curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not patient zero,&quot; offered the assistant coach.  &quot;I was inside when you were all out here... and we&#39;re not all turning into wolves,&quot; he noted, motioning to Harry.  &quot;Who had the deer tail... Matthew?&quot; he asked, then motioned with his hand to step forward.<br />
<br />
Matthew did so, stepping forward where others could see him, then turning around with the back of his shirt pulled up... big fully brown tail with white along its underside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would he be a deer while the others are—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said it,&quot; James realized.  &quot;So did you,&quot; he said to Coach Banks, pointing with his finger.  &quot;Most of the team was chanting cheers... but Harry, what about you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I said &#39;bull&#39; a few times?&quot; he asked, unconvinced the answer could be that simple.<br />
<br />
Andrew looked at his friend, the horror movie expert.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s certainly something to go on... see if it holds up.&quot;  He paused, hearing a commotion behind him, but proceeded to speak anyway.  &quot;Did... Raise your hand if you&#39;ve been transformed and you <i>don&#39;t</i> have a tail!&quot; he called out.  No one raised their hand. &quot;OK,&quot; he nodded.<br />
<br />
Coach Banks looked at Andrew, only just realizing the boy was a bit taller than he was when he&#39;d left the bus minutes earlier.  &quot;What&#39;s that tell us, Andy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rules of a horror movie, Coach,&quot; James interjected.  &quot;If you know what is causing a curse, you can try to avoid it.&quot;</p>
