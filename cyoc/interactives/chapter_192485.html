<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before you could even come to a decision, the witch already summoned her wand and tapped John in the chest with it, beginning a spell. <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me?! I wanted to turn him into a cute necklace. Urgh!” Laura, the fairy, pouted. <br />
<br />
“Turn the other one into a necklace,” Christine said. <br />
<br />
“Fine… though this one looks like he’d make a prettier dress instead,” Laura said. <br />
<br />
You took the time prepare an offensive stance in order to strike the two with spells designed to return them to male form. What you didn’t expect to see was Laura to move at such quick speeds. Before you can even begin the incantation, Laura was in front of your face with her wand in hand. <br />
<br />
“Boop!” She said, tapping her wand on your nose, leaving a sparkly effect there. <br />
<br />
You immediately try to change your stance to a counter spell stance. Laura should be weak enough to give you time to begin the counter spell. You could tell that she lacked any real magical source. Any semi-competent magic user could have resisted her spell. Unfortunately, while you had the knowledge to know how to form counter spells, you lacked any technique to apply them. You still tried anyways. <br />
<br />
“Contera! Contre! Urg, I mean Contra!” You shout, trying to use the proper movements and tone for the spell to work. Unfortunately the effects of Laura’s spell started to take effect. <br />
<br />
The speed and accuracy of transmutation spells is dependent on the amount of magic stored in a magic user’s body. Magic users all have a base amount of magic, that increases the more they practice their magic, along with increasing with their age. Magic users can also increase the amount of magic they can use by pulling from items that have magical energy to them. While this energy can be mined in magic caves or stolen from monsters, it can also come from the soul of a magic user. Transmutating a rival magic user was seen as a form of humiliation, and intense rivals would often make the effects permanent. This practice was formerly banned in most cities, though a ban could not be enforced outside. <br />
<br />
Laura was 21 years old, which is very young for a magic user. Her base storage of magic in her body was naturally low, similar to you. She also lacked any items with magical properties, with the exception of her wand. This meant that your transformation was going to be slower, unlike the transformations you witnessed back in Stonewood. <br />
<br />
It started with your clothes. Your jeans, shoes, socks, everything became instantly tighter. Each fiber and string slowly poking through your skin, until they were one in the same. This process lasted 6 seconds, which was already longer than any of the spells you saw in the Stonewood auditorium. However, this still wasn’t enough time for you to recite the counter spell in time before the next part. <br />
<br />
Your head started to cave in and “deflate.” What really was happening was the insides of your body, specifically in your head, were turning into fabric, and merging with the skin. The merging of fabric and skin feels like a short sting. One that isn’t too painful by itself, but becomes bothersome when it happens in multiple places at once. This process took 3 seconds. <br />
<br />
Despite your skull and brain being transformed into fabric, you were still able to keep your thoughts and all of your senses. Mortals would’ve probably been killed with such a transformation unless protections prior to the spell prevented such a fate, but other magic users are different. Their soul acts as a source of magic, and with a magical source, thoughts, feelings, and senses are able to be maintained. This is why they are a potential material for magic clothing and accessories for magic users, as some of the energy from their soul is able to flow to its owner and be used as another source and protection from magic. Similar to animate magic users, magic clothing and accessories produce more and more magical energy as they age, so they are rarely replaced. <br />
<br />
With your head being “deflated,” you had lost all ability to counter the spell. The rest of your fate was up to Laura, or if John could survive his transformation and be able to help you. <br />
<br />
Your deflated head started to change to the material that it’s insides were transformed into. It was a green magical fabric, different from fabric in the mortal world. It was light and very flexible, perfect for magic users who cast spells up close. It allows magic users to be very evasive. <br />
<br />
The material spread from your head into your neck, shoulders, and eventually chest. As these parts transformed, your head started to sink into your chest, to the point where the top of your head was even below your shoulders. This process all together took 7 seconds. <br />
<br />
The insides of your upper body and arms were next, and happening at the same time. As your arms collapsed, strands of fabric shot out and merged with your sides. When the fabric of different parts merges together, it gives off the feeling of irritation along with the typical stinging you have felt throughout the transformation. Your body had also started to flatten, with the pressure being as if you were squeezed by a rolling pin. It’s fairly painful, but not nearly as painful as something like being ran over by a car. This process took about 4 seconds. <br />
<br />
Your shoulders stood out, as your chest, head, and arms merges with the rest of your body. Regardless, your body above your hip was pretty much a misshapen large piece of green sparkling fabric. It was being held up straight by magic, as if it were floating. In fact, your feet started to float too. <br />
<br />
Your legs spread out as the transformation began. Similar to the rest of your body, the insiders were the first to transform into fabric. This process happened in your hips and private parts too, causing them to collapse. Your legs spread apart fairly far. Fabric shot out from inside your legs and penis and connected with eachother, giving you a very irritating, rash-like feeling. Your senses began to flow into the extra surface area. Finally, your feet, ankles, and calves forced itself upwards towards your former thighs, similar to what happened with your head. This process together lasted 9 seconds. <br />
<br />
Your transformation wasn’t complete quite yet. You were essentially still flat fabric, and not in the form of a wearable dress. This was the last part of the transformation. <br />
<br />
The two ends of your legs were the first to merge together behind you, creating a large itch and sting that you weren’t able to scratch. This merging moved upwards and lasted up to a bit above your former waist. Your shoulder’s then proceeded to merge together behind you, forming a single strap to fit a head through. This gave enough room for fairy wings to fit  and be flexible in. It took 2 more seconds for your transformation to be completed. <br />
<br />
Your body remained floating until Laura flew to you and picked you up. It took less than a second for her to put you on. <br />
<br />
“Ooh! So pretty! Let’s see how you look!” Laura shouted. She sped to a window where she could see her reflection. You were a green sparkling halter dress with a somewhat flowing skirt that reached down to Laura’s knees. You hadn’t realized that you shrank this much from the transformation. Laura didn’t have much cleavage, as she didn’t quite want to show off her small boobs. However, you were fairly tight around her waist. <br />
<br />
Having your fabric touched by her felt soothing, like you were gently being rubbed. Everytime your fabric was rubbed by her hairless body, you felt pleasure in those spots. And you felt a lot of pleasure, since Laura tended to move a lot. The flapping of Laura’s wings also caused air to flow into you, giving off the same pleasurable feel. Whenever Laura’s very long hair touched you, you did feel irritated. It was long enough to reach your skirt, even going past her wings. Apparently it wasn’t an issue to her. <br />
<br />
Your inability to move or speak was the worst part. You felt so defenseless, so weak, and honestly very claustrophobic. This paralysis gave you the worst bits of panic that you have ever felt. Since there was no way to express this panic, it built up more and more. <br />
<br />
You heard a cute, immature voice. It was Laura’s. “Be calm, my totally cute and adorable dress. I will keep you so happy and treat you very, very well. I promise. I didn’t want to do this to you, but I really had to in order to survive. So I’ll make sure you enjoy being my partner for eternity.” Her words surprisingly caused you to ease a little bit, but you still felt the worst panic of your life. <br />
<br />
Because she spoke telepathically to you, you try to do the same. “Can you hear me?” You think. <br />
<br />
“Yes, but only when I choose to, so you better make sure I’m listening! I’m going to check on Christine now, so I’m tuning you out. Kay?” Laura said, telepathically. <br />
<br />
You couldn’t tell how John was doing that entire time. You almost forgot about him. You hope he escaped, or better yet, took out Christine and is coming to save you.</p>
