<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finishing with Police Chief O&#39;Hara had had its ups and downs. On the upside, they knew that essentially justice was served in that Dymixious Drake was dead, and under circumstances that wouldn&#39;t end up leading to a massive public outcry about police brutality. Both Detective Smith and Holmes felt the country had had way too much of that over the past few years. In some ways it hurt because they wouldn&#39;t have the chance to actually try the man for his murder of Lionel Ulysses, but at least they could close that particular case. The real down part was that there were still a lot of questions that needed to be answered, and in many ways, Dymixious Drake was the only one who could answer them and with him dead there was no way they could be answered. That alone left the two Seattle Detectives a bit down as they came out Moon Lake Police Station.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... at least we have a bad guy off the streets,&quot; Detective Holmes gave a sigh as they reached the car they&#39;d come to the small town, &quot;I wish we could have gotten hear earlier in the day... perhaps we could have prevented there being a fight and bringing him in alive for questioning, but at least he&#39;s off the streets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Him giving some answers would have been nice,&quot; Detective Smith agreed, &quot;as there are still a LOT of questions to be asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Detective Smith climbed into the back seat while Detective Holmes climbed into the front seat. They looked over to Agent Peters who looked rather calm as she climbed in and turned the key and started the engine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re rather calm?&quot; Detective Holmes commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Agent Peters answered as she backed out and got them on the road, &quot;I would have liked more answers too... Particularly from Dymixious, but we can&#39;t change the fact that the Moon Lake PD found him and took him down... thankfully with no civilian casualties. And while there may be more answers to get, we need to remember that Dymixious is not the ONLY one we had questions for... and I&#39;d be rather optimistic that we WILL get answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean talking with Tachibana?&quot; Detective Smith asked, &quot;Does that really matter now? I mean... much of the concern was that she might be hiding him, but with Dymixious dead... it&#39;s not like that is an issue anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may not be much... and I doubt we&#39;d ever get enough for a warrant, but it&#39;d at least give us some closure to put into the final reports before this case is officially closed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two detectives soon shrugged and gave a nod. It made sense and they rode along as Agent Peters negotiated the streets of Moon Lake, which was rather easy since Moon Lake didn&#39;t have that many intersecting streets to get lost on. They eventually came to a walled compound on the north side of the town&#39;s main East/West running street, though the parking area was on the side street. Turning to it, both Seattle detectives noted the oriental design of the wall and the gate. They could some bits of the building within the gate and felt that what they saw had a very oriental design, though if Akane no Tachibana had come to Moon Lake from Japan, that&#39;d make sense. The thing that was more modern was that there was a posted intercom to the left of the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, who is this?&quot; a voice inquired over the intercom.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Agent Peters of the FBI, I and some associates have some questions for Akane No Tachibana,&quot; Agent Peters spoke, &quot;there are no charges. We just wish to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the voice answered, &quot;Please full forward slowly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gates then slowly pulled inward and Agent Peters pulled through. She parked in front of what could only be a garage, which had a very Japanese style flair to it. As they got out of the car, they watched as the gates closed behind them and then looked around. The &quot;garage&quot; was connected to the main housing area which had an almost palace-like design to it, though scaled down so that fit into a smaller land allotment that was available in a small town in Washington State. But that didn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t impressive with its white paint and black tile roof that flared out over the walls of the structure. It was definitely oriental in design, but neither Detective Smith nor Holmes could say anything specific on it.<br />
<br />
There was a modest front yard that was well manicured with a pair of large bushes that had been manicured like bonsai trees in ceramic pots that sat on the flanks of a stone walking path that lead up to a pair of doors on the front of the house. They slowly followed the stone path up toward the house and were a bit surprised when the door opened before they could get a chance to knock. They were met by a Japanese woman in a woman&#39;s business suit that was well pressed and made to fit her perfectly. Which did well as all three could easily notice the well developed curves on the woman. There were a few small age lines on her face and a couple gray hairs that were noticed, but not too many. She looked like she was between forty and fifty and had aged rather well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Agent Peters with the FBI, these are Detective&#39;s Smith and Holmes with the Seattle Police Department, we&#39;re here to speak with Akane no Tachibana concerning some answers she gave us on the phone,&quot; Agent Peters.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am she,&quot; the woman answered with a small nod and stood quietly as their eyes practically bulged out of their head, likely surprised at that revelation.<br />
<br />
Agent Peters couldn&#39;t say anything for a moment or two. The voice was the same as the voice they&#39;d had on the phone, but if Akane no Tachibana had come to the US after WWII and had lost a husband during the war, there was no way this woman could be her. She looked way too young.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are surprised that I am not overly wrinkled and hunched over, I take it?&quot; Akane asked, &quot;I assure you... healthy living and exercise can do wonders for you. Cleans out tension and keeps things working beautifully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... if... you came here after World War II...&quot; Detective Holmes spoke, sounding very surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, healthy living and regular exercise does wonders,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Come in. We may talk in my study. We may share tea and discuss whatever questions you have regarding Dymixious Drake that you think I was unclear on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know why we&#39;re here?&quot; Agent Peters asked slowly as they began to follow Akane into the house. The furnishings were elegant and oriental, but Agent Peters also noticed some family photos on the walls, many of them with happy looking Japanese families. Akane lead them to a side room from the main entrance, and she effortlessly moved a heavy wooden door along its sliding track to give them entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am well aware of the news that you are after Dymixious Drake,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and well aware of your call concerning the man. Do not think me so feeble that I would forget that. You called me because you found evidence that connected Dymixious to me. I answered those questions for you. And you are here now... which can only mean that the answers given were not to your satisfaction and you want a greater explanation as to why Dymixious had my number and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three slowly entered into the study and noted that it carried the feel of a European style study/private library, even with much of the architecture retaining a very oriental motif to it. Close to the western side of the room there was a large wooden desk with a set of couches facing it on the other side of the room. Between the two was a small coffee table, with a steaming pot of tea sitting on the center of the coffee table. It sat directly on a glass stand with a lit candle in its center. Agent Peters could smell the tea&#39;s scent in the air, which was strong but herbal. Bookshelves seemed to line the walls of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there were some things that didn&#39;t sit right,&quot; Agent Peters admitted as she moved to sit on one end of the couch and with the two detectives then nervously seated beside her, &quot;It&#39;s not that we have reason to believe that you were involved in anything illegal... but it is odd that a man we think was a serial vigilante would do business with the head of a major pharmaceuticals company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane sat down in a chair that was across and to the side of the room. She was able to look directly over to Agent Peters, and would have to turn her head slightly to look to the two detectives. Akane then leaned forward and began to pour tea from the teapot to a set of cups that were next to the teapot. The cups had no handle but looked to be made of a thick ceramic that wouldn&#39;t absorb heat too quickly. As she finished, she then moved a cup so that they were in reach of all three of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel free, the tea is herbal and good for your health,&quot; Akane offered politely, and privately amazing the three of them at how calm the woman was. While she knew why they were there, Agent Peters had found Akane&#39;s demeanor very calm, as though she had dealt with things like this before or that she was very good at dealing with stress, which was especially reflective in the fact that she was able to remain a good degree of proper etiquette while they talked. The three law enforcement agents looked to each other, but eventually did accept the tea. As Agent Peters sipped hers, Akane began to answer the question that had been asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tachibana Industries/Enterprises... depending on which advertisement you look to regarding the company name, does more than pharmaceuticals,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and my dealings with Dymixious and his father relate to some of those other fields. The deal proposed failed and the Drakes were rude and arrogant in their pushing for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it failed...&quot; Detective Holmes spoke, &quot;we met... briefly with Dymixious&#39;s father when we searched his compound between here and Seattle. The man didn&#39;t strike us as having the temperament to really be successful in the business world... not unless you&#39;re looking for someone to essentially bully someone else into selling or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we also didn&#39;t find any records of ANY business transactions, no receipts, no loan documentation,&quot; Detective Smith picked up, &quot;We couldn&#39;t even find any indication of a good or service that Dymixious or his father could have offered... And while that could show the failings of their business acumen, it also makes it odd that they would still have your personal number and would contact you when facing legal trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I remember correctly, I believe what he wished to offer was some method of personal security that he wanted to employ... something about taking a bite out of crime that went beyond merely reporting it to the police,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;They withheld a lot of the information from me and it ultimately failed when they couldn&#39;t even get their system ready... Outside of a note for our records stating that the venture failed, there wasn&#39;t much need for us to make any further note than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would he come to you looking for help, especially if he knows whatever project it was failed?&quot; Agent Peters asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The why I cannot be certain,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Though I would say his arrogance and sense of self importance was such that he might not be one to accept orders from anyone else... or &quot;no&quot; for an answer. And as I told you on the phone call, all that I was told was that his wife needed medical care for her pregnancy. I told him that Moon Lake had a good hospital and could provide for her pregnancy... but was really about it. By the time that I saw the news in which you had announced the manhunt for him... he was already in Moon Lake seeking out that medical care for his wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you...?&quot; Agent Peters asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am also on Moon Lake&#39;s City Council,&quot; Akane explained, &quot;and updated by the Moon Lake Police Department as such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not call us?&quot; Detective Smith wondered, &quot;we just came from the Police... they commented on going after him and needing to wait because of their being stretched thin because of some other violent crook that needed to be dealt with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had spoken with the Moon Lake Police on the matter,&quot; Akane said slowly, &quot;but they wished to avoid having a fight until that matter was dealt with. While I&#39;m sure your agents could have helped... it was felt to be delicate enough that it was better to wait until after the first issue was dealt with. Which has since been dealt with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Agent Peters said slowly and gave a heavy sigh, &quot;You know... there is a lot about all this that has raised a lot of questions... and so far, while you have been helpful, something&#39;s just telling me that I&#39;m not getting everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because Dymixious is dead,&quot; Detective Smith said with a sigh, &quot;we hoped to come in... alert your police to his possible presence and ask for any and all cooperation in arresting him, only to find out that he&#39;d fought your police and died this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do apologize for not being able to give you all the answers you seek,&quot; Akane said to them.<br />
<br />
And in that she was honest. She could give more clarification on the things that she knew they were after, but the hunt for Dymixious Drake had already come to close to exposing the were secret in unfavorable circumstances. There was the theoretical possibility that if they could make the reveal gently and in circumstances that didn&#39;t involve a crime that things could be worked out to a satisfactory resolution for all, but between the fact that Lionel Ulysses had been caught on Police body cam footage transforming, an instinctive reaction to being shot, and the fact that Dymixious Drake&#39;s temper was such that any attempt at arrest would have lead to a major fight, the answers that would give these officers of the law the full clarification would only make things difficult for Moon Lake. And for the moment, with the were secret still a secret, Akane had given all that she could.</p>
