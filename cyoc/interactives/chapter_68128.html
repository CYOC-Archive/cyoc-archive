<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Dave stopped by Kyle's place, just like they had originally planned.  Kyle, of course, wasn't there to greet him. Dave spent more than 15 
minutes there waiting and waiting. He tried several times to pick up his phone, but Kyle never answered. Just as he got up to leave, the rain 
started to pour. "Just my luck!" Dave said miserably. He was wearing a rain jacket, but the through of walking home in the rain was not fun, so 
he waited a few more minutes. Board and cold, Dave slipped his hood over his head and walked out into the pouring rain. His visibility was near 
zero so he didn't see Josh car pull into the driveway.</p>

<p>The walk wasn't all miserable as he had thought it would be. Just as he rounded the corner to his street, the rain let up, but the clouds 
were still thick up above. Thats when he could hear the foot steps. Quickly he turned around and spotted what he thought was a homeless kid 
running towards him. The guy was soaked to the bone. His whole body was covered with mud, twigs and leaves stuck his his hair and clothes, 
basically he was mess. When the boy made eye contact, Dave knew exactly who it was. "Alex?"</p>

<p>Alex skidded to a stop just infront of Dave. "Dave? W-what are you doing here?" </p>

<p>"I could ask the same thing about you. What happened? It looks like you got into a fight with a mud monster." Dave looked up and down, 
examining the boy. </p>

<p>"Its a long story and you wouldn't believe me anyways." Alex quickly answered, quickly directing his eyes to his feet. </p>

<p>Dave closed the space between them and wrapped his arm around him. He knew he wouldn't get any more information out him, at least at 
the moment. "Come on, lets get you home." He walked Alex back to his place, the house that Alex had currently been living in for the past year. 
Dave's parants were foster parants and often took in troubled teens. Alex had a bad home situation with a drunk for a mom and an abusive 
dad, who was doing jail time.</p>

<p>After Alex washed up and changed, Dave brought up food to Alex's room so they could talk in private without Dave's parants or little 
brother knowing. Which Alex was thankful for. Alex liked Dave's parants and didn't want to worry them. During their small dinner, Alex could 
feel Dave's gaze on him. "Okay, okay... I'll tell you. I... uh. I ... uh..."</p>

<p>"Come one, what happened?" Dave pressed lightly.  </p>

<p>"Its... hard to explain you wouldn't believe unless I showed you." Alex answered after a brief pause. </p>

<p>"Show me what?" Dave pressed again. </p>

<p>"Well, it sort of has to do with Kyle and Josh?" </p>

<p>"What! They did that to you?" Dave exclaimed. </p>

<p>"No, I kind of did it to my self while I was fighting another guy?" </p>

<p>"What so you got into a fight with someone?  </p>

<p>"Kind of... I... it was weird. I was like... fighting myself and another guy at the same time." </p>

<p>"Huh? This doesn't make any sense." </p>

<p>"I know... Just let me show you." Alex abruptly stood up and lead the way. "Hey, Dave and I are going out for a little bit." Alex called to his 
foster parants before they left the house.  </p>

<p>Alex got into the passenger sear of Dave's truck and instructed Dave to drive to Kyle's house. Dave held up his questions as he took them 
the short distance to Kyle's place. He parked the car across the street, and Alex then lead them up to Kyle's house. Though they didn't go to the 
front door. "Alex, what are we doing?"</p>

<p>"Shhh...." Alex said as he put his finger to his lips. He lead the way to side of the house where a window opened up to the house's interior. 
From outside you could clearly see the living and the connected dinning room. The lights were on now, but no one could be seen. </p>

<p>"Alex, I didn't take you here so we could spy on Kyle. What has this to do with how you looked earlier." Dave asked, annoyed now. Alex told 
him to be quite and then explained what happened in detail. Of course, Dave didn't believe him, and thought that maybe Alex had hit his head 
and imagined all this. But then, almost on cue, Kyle and Josh came out of the kitchen with a plate of food. Dave gawked, as he took in the sight 
before him. Kyle and Josh's heads were sitting on the same shoulders, just inches apart. They weren't wearing a shirt so he could clearly see it 
wasn't some elaborate prank or something.</p>

<p>Alex just nodded his head and simply said, "That is what happened to me." </p></p>
