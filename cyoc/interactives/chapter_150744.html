<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hanging out with Nick for the day Matt had decided that he was going to try the website out at home. He&#39;d been thinking about all kinds of things he wanted to buy. But as he sat down at the website it just seemed like there was too much to choose from. He could get just about whatever he wanted and the options seemed to be unlimited. His mind was finally set on a pocket pussy. <br />
<br />
After breaking up with his girlfriend he&#39;d not been looking around all that much for someone else. At the same time he was still horny as ever. Being a college football stud was hard work and his hormones were often raging. He needed a way to release them and always heard that it&#39;s just about the next best thing. Besides he was getting tired of his hand and wanted to feel his dick embraced by something else again. He set the order.<br />
<br />
The next day the package arrived at his door and he pulled it into his apartment. A bit of excitement ran through him as he thought about using it right away. &quot;The fuck?&quot; he cursed as he pulled out a long thick dildo. &quot;I didn&#39;t order a dildo!&quot; he shouted, then calmed down as he remembered just how thin his apartment walls could be. His voice often carried through them and the neighbors had complained a few times about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; he set the large piece of silicon on the table. It had a suction cup at the end making it swing around slightly as it sat there. A bit of a smile crept on his face. &quot;Could play so many pranks with this thing though...&quot; He thought about shoving in someone like Kyle&#39;s locker during practice and then see his face when he pulls it out and has to explain why he has it. &quot;But what about my dildo?&quot; he asked as he realized he wouldn&#39;t be able to get it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; he scoffed reminding himself that he didn&#39;t want it. &quot;I should probably just send it back...&quot; Walking over to his laptop he pulled up the website again looking for a phone number to call. But his eyes seemed to keep drifting back to the long penis shaped object pointing up from the table. He bit his lips looking at it&#39;s phallic shape. He could feel his own getting erect just like it.<br />
<br />
Slowly he put his phone down and walked back over to it. He pulled out a bit of the lube that came with the package and ran it up and down the dildo. Feeling his hands running over the erect penis sent a shiver down his spine. He could feel himself getting hard but did his best not to touch himself. &quot;What are yo doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down realizing that his shorts were around his ankles and the dildo was properly lubed up for him to use. &quot;What are you doing!?&quot; he tried to stop himself as he placed it on the ground but his body wouldn&#39;t seem to listen. Inside he a mix of emotions ran through his mind as he tried to reason out the sexual pleasure he was currently deriving from all the new thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m not gay!&quot; he shouted but the dick was placed on the ground beneath him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not -- mmpphhh...&quot; the shout turned to a moan as the tip of the rod touched his anus. It puckered at the sensation and slowly started to open as his large muscular body put more and more pressure on it. Slowly he pushed harder and harder into as his anus opened up more. He could feel the cold lube coating his insides while the hard plastic dug deeper into him. His mind was abuzz as a hand was wildly masturbating himself. His strong football trained legs made it easy to control the pressure and the suction cup at the end allowed him to slowly jerk himself up and down.<br />
<br />
A series of unintelligible moans and whimpers left his mouth with each new thrust but he couldn&#39;t help but find them pleasurable. After a few more thrusts he felt his own body release the pressure as cum shot across his dining room. &quot;Aww fuck...&quot; he fell to his side and slowly removed the dildo from inside him. Each inch caused his dick to throb for a round two but he did his best to fight off the urge. &quot;I need to complain...&quot; he muttered as he looked at the number still in his phone. But deep down he knew he was 100% satisfied with his purchase.</p>
