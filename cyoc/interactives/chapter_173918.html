<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey!&quot; I shout as I kick Liz with my back hoof. While she was trying to hide it, I caught this crazy bitch as she was just about to shove something into my pussy. My tail was swishing back and forth which often happened when I was annoyed. &quot;Just finish milking my udder Liz. And don&#39;t just shove things into my pussy. I can&#39;t believe I even have to say that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww come on. It was just a vibrator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liz&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so it was a remote controlled vibrator.&quot; Liz corrected herself. I just kept on staring at her. &quot;Ok, so it was a remote controlled vibrator that was small enough where you specifically, could never remove it by your self because of your hooves.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make me have to call your lab in as a health violation concern to the government.&quot; This was my usual threat to her, which of course I would never actually do, but it served as a proper punishment for her most of the time. &quot;Ok, fine. Also... no you won&#39;t. Not with those hooves of yours, hehe.&quot; I felt something quickly get shoved fairly deep into my pussy. Shit, she finally called my bluff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it mmmmhhhh Liz, this-unnnghhhh, isn&#39;t funny.&quot; I say through small bursts of pleasure. For the past few minutes, Liz has been playing with the remote to the vibrator in my pussy non-stop. To be fair, I kind of was enjoying it. But hell if I will give her the satisfaction of being right. So what if I get arroused at the thought of being under hee control? She doesn&#39;t need to know that. If she did, it would go straight to her head and I would wind up stuck inside some robotic body frame, which moves me around like a puppet or something. Actually, that may be kind of fun. <br />
<br />
Damn it, why am I such a sub to her as of late? I use to be the dominant one in our relationship. Like, I know I am part animal, but that shouldn&#39;t make me this submissive right? I swear, ever since she was promoted to head of the genetics department, she has become way more dominant and I in turn have been turned completely into her submissive bitch. Its like she took my dominant trait and swapped it with her submissive one. <br />
<br />
The worst part is that I actually kind of prefer it this way. It is a lot less work on my part, which is great for me because hooves can only do so much. Well, at least she finished milking me before she started playing around. &quot;So, how long do we have here mooooOOO?&quot; I ask, mooing at the end from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I managed to book us for a full 2 weeks&quot; Liz said proudly. Damn 2 whole weeks? She must have gotten one hell of a pay raise or something because this place is expensive as fuck to rent, even for just a weekend. Last year this place was $1,100 for a Friday night to Sunday Afternoon weekend stay for 2. And that didn&#39;t include food or travel expenses. That was just the booking price. Then again, the mountain view, especially from our balcony is beautiful. And the interior is really modernized for its log cabin-y exterior look and cozy feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Sarah. How does my special cow want to spend her 2 week vacation?&quot; asked Liz. &quot;Well, skiing isn&#39;t possible for me, so that is out.&quot; I don&#39;t even know why I own skiing equipment in the first place. It isn&#39;t like I could ever use them with me having hooves and all. It was so odd though. I have vague memories of the both of us skiing last year, but that clearly wasn&#39;t possible. &quot;I don&#39;t know really. 2 weeks is a long time. I definitely want to have sex with you a lot though. So maybe just that I guess. At least for a start.&quot; It really was all that I could come up with at the moment. Snowy mountain cabins are not really the best locations for cowgirls to take extended vacations to. <br />
<br />
&quot;As I expected you to say. Don&#39;t worry, I bought a lot of new toys for us to play with. And a few things from my lab.&quot; Liz had whispered that last sentence so that I would miss it. &quot;Ok, how much did you really spend on all this Liz? You didn&#39;t throw us into debt did you?&quot; Knowing Liz, this actually wasn&#39;t an impossibility. <br />
<br />
Liz puffs out her modest at best chest proudly. &quot;$0.00, this entire trip is bought and paid for by a stratigically used grant I managed to snag.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words, you are misusing grant money again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Well, not this time at least. This is kind of a business trip, which I turned into our vacation since the criteria was very simple. Test the effects of hybridization in cooler climets and at higher elevations. Thus, we were allowed to take our snowy mountain cabin vacation for free.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what is this hybridization experiment?&quot; It certainly would be nice if this was all true. But this is the first I have heard about Liz even starting her research into hybridization. Liz points to a sealed PVC tube near the door. &quot;That is the experiment. I just need to keep this here for 2 weeks. That is it. Check it once daily to see if anything of significance has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed a bit too simple of an experiment in my opinion. Definitely not worth spending tens of thousands on lodging and food alone. How much was this grant even worth where doing this kind of thing wasn&#39;t even an issue? <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, enough about my work, we are here to enjoy ourselves as well.&quot; Said Liz. She was right, and maybe I was overthinking it a little too much. I walk over to her side on all fours. I coukd have done it standing, but feeling the weight of my udders swinging below me is always such a turn on, that doing it only just on special occasions makes it kinda fun in and of itself. Plus I know Liz enjoys watching my ass sway as I walk like this. I look up into her eyes and sure enough, they were glued to my ass. I give it a playful shake to tease her, kind of hoping she would press the button on the remote some more. She had already gotten me horny, so now it was her responsibility to finish me off.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Sarah had fallen asleep after several hours of sex. Liz on the other hand, was taking a bunch of reference data from her. Things like temperature, blood pressure, monitoring her breathing, etc. So far, her expiration with the hybridization of Sarah was going perfectly. The subject&#39;s immune sysrem was not fighting it at all even. Which was a huge plus. Hypnotizing her to see her new form as her usual self was absolutely the right call too. <br />
<br />
The only change of significance was that Sarah had become extremely submissive to Liz once she became aroused. If she was not aroused at all, she would act like her normal self. Aside from that, Liz couldn&#39;t find any difference or concern worth reporting about to the board of directors who issued her grant. Liz paused her typing and took a sip of milk directly from Sarah&#39;s teats while she did her best to not wake her up. This was something she did have to report though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Subject Sarah&#39;s milk is found to be mildly addictive, but not likely to cause any symptoms of withdrawal if regular consumption were to suddenly stop. No know side effects from drinking it have been discovered, or are of note either. However, there is a potential for it to be a slight aphrodisiac as well. However it will require further looking into at this time.&quot; typed Liz into her tablet. She drank another suck full of milk and closed her computor down while snuggling up to her cowgirl lover, popping one of her teats into her mouth and began sucking on it like a baby with a pacifier as she drifted off to sleep.</p>
