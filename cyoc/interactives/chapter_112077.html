<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Five weres were sitting at the kitchen table each munching on fruit and cereal. A were-lioness sitting next to her werewolf mate; purring as she wraps her tail around her mate’s. Two were-panthers sitting next to a werewolf/panther/feline hybrid; the three munching on bowls of cereal as they silently watch the older couple try to keep the other’s paws of each other while eating breakfast. Eric, Spencer and Frieda enjoying the show Nate and Jean are providing; the three are playing their own game of affection. Placing paws on Spencer as she sat in between  Eric and Frieda; each massaging and stroking a furry thigh as Spencer purrs and growls.<br />
<br />
This display of affection continues until Martha and William Anderson come up from the basement. In their were-fox fursonas; the bonded couple are soon followed by a second pair of were-foxes, Dawn and Douglas Hale.<br />
“Well,” William looking at the five weres sitting at the table; “it looks like we weren’t the only ones to have fun last night.”<br />
“Can you blame us,” Nate speaking up; “but Jean and I didn’t get much sleep thank to the three in front of us. Eric,” Nate shaking his head while chuckling; “you, Spencer and Frieda can be quite noisy with your rutting.”<br />
“And your were-lioness mate,” Eric smiling; “has a roar that can make any wolf cringe in fear.”<br />
“Why thank you,” Jean smiling; “I do love your brother knotting me up.”<br />
“Okay,” William shaking his head as he and Martha got the coffee machine going; “that’s enough. If you five are finished breakfast, then be off with you; we adults want the kitchen for a while.”<br />
<br />
“Got any plans for the day,” Nate looking at his brother; “want to earn some easy cash?”<br />
“What do you mean by easy,” Eric looking at his werewolf brother suspiciously; “you still not trying to get me to help you out with your landscaping business?”<br />
“Eric and Spencer are joining me,” Frieda speaking up; “as we keep Aunt Lila’s niece and nephews occupied while she has a baby shower.”<br />
“If you were smart,” Nate smiling; “you’d help me and Alex lay sod. It sounds much more safer and easier than looking after three troublesome were-tiger cubs.”<br />
“I’ll take my chances,” Eric chuckling;  placing a white furred paw on Frieda’s shoulder as they went back to his room.<br />
<br />
Nate shakes his head as he joins Jean in his room; watching her take her were-birth control pill and feeling a little down that she is shifting out of her fursona. Nate wanted to fun to continue, but with his job and Jean’s course load at Moon Lake college; the best the two could have at the moment is a few nights a week together. Nate smiles as he defurs; his body shifting from his werewolf form back to his more mundane human self. Remembering how he started his landscaping business after Alex and Ben joked regarding lots of money to be made shoveling driveways as they arrived back in Moon Lake from their Christmas shopping venture. A large deluge of snow hitting Moon Lake and most of Washington that day; it wasn’t long afterwards that Nates snow shovel was soon replaced with a snow blower, and when the snow melted a lawnmower. Falling into landscaping by accident; it wasn’t long that Nate found out he was good at it. Designing and creating yards with plants that are non-invasive to the local area; it wasn’t long that he had a thriving clientele and a half decent supplier of his needed material. The only thing Nate hated in regards to his business is the invoices and bills he had to deal with. Spending more time collecting money owed to him and paying for his supplies was a headache unto itself. Hoping that when the new school year starts on Tuesday after the labor day long weekend, he could take advantage of any optional courses in regards to accounting. Nate needed to learn if he was going to keep his business up and running.<br />
<br />
“Are you going to stand their naked,” Jean looking at Nate; “or do you intend to get dressed?”<br />
“Sorry,” Nate looking embarrassed as he quickly gets dressed; “I was lost in thought.”<br />
“Were you thinking of me,” Jean quickly behind Nate rubbing her hands up his washboard abs; made more defined with his manual labor job.<br />
“No,” Nate sighing; “just thinking of how I’m going to be able to keep going with it just being me, Alex and a few shovels to run my burgeoning business.”<br />
“Hire some help,” Jean purring; “place an ad in a newspaper.”<br />
“Easier said than done,” Nate putting on his work shirt; “if only some of my clients paid their bills when invoiced and then I wouldn’t be worried so much about the shoestring budget I’m on.”<br />
“Have you tried getting a line of credit from the bank,” Jean looking at her lover.<br />
“I need a co-signer since,” Nate looking at Jean; &quot;I’m still technically a minor. I don’t want to put my parents in that position if my business fails. And since,” Nate holding Jean; “you are financially tied up with you studies of being a lawyer, I can’t exactly ask you.”<br />
“So what are you going to do then,” Jean looking at Nate<br />
“Do what I’ve been doing all the past week,” Nate sighing; “calling up those that have yet to pay what they owe and remind them of the bill they still have to pay. But first,” Nate looking at the time; “I and Alex have a back breaking morning laying sod.”<br />
<br />
After kissing Nate and watching him and Alex jump into the pickup truck he got; trading in his previous car for the work vehicle. The truck cab full of lawnmowers, shovels and other yard work equipment. Hoping into her Shelby Cobra that her father got for her as a late high school graduation present; Jean quickly heads to the college campus. Pulling into the parking lot and getting out of her car and clicking a button on her key chain to activate the car alarm her father installed; Jean thinks of the time she met Nate’s secret admirer, a werewolf about his age named Zylina.<br />
<br />
Catching the girl following Nate as he met up with her at the Talbot house several months ago; Jean was surprised the girl had the moxy to challenge her for Nate’s love. Zylina calling Jean a declawed kitty that has no business being with a virile werewolf like Nate. The naïve girl was soon shocked and scared when Jean exploded into her were-lioness fursona and outright said “we lions don’t mewl and hiss to a threat. WE ROAR! So do you really want to challenge me pup?”<br />
<br />
That was the last time Zylina approached Jean and ran off shortly after; but Jean could always smell the werewolf stalking her and Nate whenever the two were together. Ensuring sure the determine girl could hear their rutting; Jean always roared as loud as she could when her orgasm rocked her body. Making sure that the pestering werewolf knew that Nate was her Mate and that she had no intention of letting him go. Going so far as to have her father Leon stare the girl down and make it clear to Zylina that you don’t want to mess with an elder council member and his daughter. While that did keep the girl at bay from bothering them; Jean knew that Zylina would soon be back to tormenting Nate when school begins again for him on Tuesday.</p>
