<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The clock has struck 6.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Emerging from Jeff&#39;s computer was a massive ripple that, in just mere seconds, had crossed the entire globe. But more importantly it allows the Chronivac to find the targets it needs for it&#39;s changes. The first person we follow is one Matt Kendrick, Jeff&#39;s older brother.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Matt had just gotten off football practice and was driving his car home when the ripple reached him. As the wave of reality washed over him, a small shiver ran down the jock&#39;s spine. With it&#39;s target in sight, the Chronivac whirred as it prepared the changes. After a few moments, the program dinged and multiple progress bars appeared, each showing it&#39;s four targets. Once it was done with Matt, he&#39;d become a strong father for Anita.<br />
<br />
<br />
   As Matt drove, a strange feeling emerged within him. As each minute passed, various aspects of the man&#39;s body adjusted themselves. All of which functioned in relation to Matt&#39;s age. Muscles built up further as he moved through his twenties, his shirt and varsity jacket feeling slightly tighter as he grew more masculine and imposing. 20s shifted into 30s, with Matt&#39;s buzz cut beginning to recede at the front as the signs of aging began to creep into him. His burst of power rapidly declined, Matt&#39;s muscles quickly fading under layers of fat. A bit of his t-shirt rode up his belly as a sizable gut emerged from his tummy. His eight pack got consumed, the lower half melding into the man&#39;s gut as the upper half grew softer. His pecs had also suffered a similar fate, strength melting away into soft moobs. His arms and legs weren&#39;t spared from the changes either. Both limbs grew longer, forcing him to move his body to the point his back touched the chair. The muscles in both arms also got consumed by the fatty tissue. His hands and feet then expanded, wrinkles and calluses forming upon them as they caught up with Matt&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Matt&#39;s face had also shown signs of aging. His youthful looks drained as wrinkles etched themselves throughout his face. Stretch marks had formed on the sides of his mouth, and some notable crow&#39;s feet formed at the edges of his eyes. His face grew wider, and his jaw squared off more. A small second chin then formed. The ridges above his eyes pushed forward slightly, giving him a permanent scowl. His shirt began to tear a bit as his neck widened and shoulders broadened. The lump in his throat grew larger, Matt&#39;s voice becoming loud, intimidating. After 20 minutes, Matt&#39;s age settled at a solid 45.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Matt continued to drive while blissfully unaware that he&#39;d rapidly grown older. But despite his new age, the Chronivac wasn&#39;t quite done with him yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Matt&#39;s hairline continued to recede by just a bit. Meanwhile, on the back of his head, various follicles thinned while others went back into his skin. A small bald spot was quickly forming. While his hair maintained it&#39;s short style, the color darkened from brown to black. Bits of grey had also been sprinkled in there, particularly around the edges. As he lost some hair on his head, he had also gained some. Black fuzz trailed down from the sides of his head before meeting at his chin. The hair then surrounded the man&#39;s mouth. A thick bush of hair emerged from his upper lip, a mustache materializing on his face. Meanwhile, the facial hair around his mouth became more boxy in shape, forming into a goatee. Some grey and white hairs emerged in his chin. His eyebrows had also grown bushier.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Hair then trailed down his body with a thin line of fluff growing down the middle of his chest. Bushy hair branched out from that trail, quickly covering Matt&#39;s chest and stomach with some of it being visible through some of the rips in his shirt. Light dustings of hair then covered his arms, legs, hands, and feet. Bits of white and grey had shone themselves on this new mat of fuzz, giving it a salt and pepper look. While his body gained an influx of hair, his skin had also undergone its own change as it seemed to tan.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Most of Matt&#39;s physical changes had then reached completion. Another wave was then sent out by the machine, this one containing the final bits of information to finish Matt&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Matt drove up to a stoplight right when the thing turned red. The man grumbled in frustration, his deeper voice practically reverberating through the air. As the wave washed over Matt, multiple things occurred in his body at once.<br />
<br />
<br />
   First was his clothes. Much of them were now torn or barely holding on, but this was quickly rectified. All of his attire enlarged to fit Matt&#39;s body. His t-shirt quickly restitched itself while the neck deepened to a V, showcasing the man&#39;s upper chest hair. His jeans shortened, the denim hardening into leather as they became a pair of leather shorts. A black belt slithered around his new pair of legwear. His running shoes expanded, the tongue and collar of them raising slightly higher than his ankle. More string materialized and tied themselves, and the color of his now boots became brown. <br />
<br />
<br />
   The most drastic change, however, was his varsity jacket. The halves of the jacket grew closer. The split stitched itself together, various buttons sinking back into the material. The sleeves of his jacket shrunk before they were the same measurement as the t-shirt he was wearing. Both pockets disappeared, with a breast pocket forming on the right side of the shirt. The upper portion of the jacket&#39;s split remained with the collar of the shirt collapsing to the sides. With a quick change in color, from red to yellow, Matt was now wearing a polo shirt. As a finishing touch, a gold engagement ring formed around his left ring finger.<br />
<br />
<br />
   While all this went on, Matt felt a migraine coming on. With another grunt, he moved a hand to his head and rubbed it while the other hand gripped the steering wheel. His college years were now far behind him, Matt now thinking of himself as a father. His view of his now former brother changed, an annoyance with the kid forming due to how Jeff was always hitting on his daughter. But Marco managed. Anita liked the kid, so Marco had to come to accept it. Despite this, a strong protective desire still rooted itself in the man&#39;s brain. He still had his duties as a father.<br />
<br />
<br />
   English quickly became more of a second language to Marco. Spanish, on the other hand, was changing to be the man&#39;s first language. Marco&#39;s vocal cords shifted again, this time introducing a Spanish accent to the man&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
<br />
   Next on the mental agenda was the man&#39;s life. Long gone was a football playing college student, with those thoughts and knowledge being replaced by a rather extensive life as a police lieutenant. A sudden pain in Marco&#39;s chest hammered this home, a scar forming with a pacemaker materializing in his heart. As he clutched his chest, he shook his head, the memory of being shot in the chest having formed in his mind. Once the portion of his life as an officer was laid out, a new area laid itself out. A sudden pain surged on his left arm due to black ink embedding itself beneath his skin. A tattoo was drawing itself on him, prompting memories of Marco to recall his former status as a gang member. <br />
<br />
<br />
   As his headache died down, Marco opened his eyes, the emerald green of the irises darkening to brown. Regaining his composure, he looked back up at the stoplight right when it turned green. Putting his foot on the gas pedal, he continued his drive back home. <br />
<br />
<br />
   The Chronivac had now finished it&#39;s changes on Matt. With one last reality-shifting wave, it changed Matt&#39;s sports car into Marco&#39;s police cruiser. A roof formed atop the vehicle, windows materialized, and the paint job shifted from red to black. The district&#39;s emblem emerged on one of the doors, and a siren bulged out of the top of the roof. The last change involved the car&#39;s shape, the vehicle shifting to a more boxy appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Marco pulled his car up to the apartment complex his family, alongside the Kendricks, resided in. He&#39;d just gotten off work. Exiting the cruiser, he closed the door (although it came off more as a slam) and walked up to the front door of the complex. Once he walked through the threshold, he turned his head to find his daughter and Jeff snuggling up with each other on the couch in front of the TV. He hummed, right, it was date night. <br />
<br />
<br />
   Anita seemed to be the first to notice him, &quot;Hey papa! Mama&#39;s up in our apartment. How was work?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
   Jeff seemed to avert eye contact, but mumbled something inaudible. Marco raised an eyebrow, but decided not to press. &quot;I can talk about it later, you two continue your little… date night.&quot; Marco then ascended up the stairs to meet his wife.</p>
