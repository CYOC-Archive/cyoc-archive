<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm went off at 0630 the next morning, and I groggily got up. Almost automatically, I walked towards the bathroom. The gush of pee flowing out between my legs felt weird, and reminded me of who I now was. At least for the next couple of days. The view in the mirror further underscored this. I studied the reflection, bare breasts, wild hair and makeup all over the face. Damn, even like this Monika looked pretty good.<br />
<br />
I undressed and stepped into the shower. As the water ran over my body, I started getting horny again. But I knew I didn't have enough time to explore my body further. I would have to live with the lack of fulfillment until later, and I decided to quickly finish the shower.<br />
<br />
After drying off, I picked found Monikas underwear drawer and picked out a clean set, identical to the one she had worn yesterday. Dressing, feeling the soft fabric of stockings running up my shapely legs, of the thong settling between my lovely asscheeks, woke my sexuality again. I found the entire morning ritual, dressing up in a uniform that was very much a fetish for me, though not usually from this side of it, to be highly erotic.<br />
<br />
I did not have time for giving myself release, though. I needed to make that breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Bruce, your breakfast is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was four minutes to eight as he came out of the bathroom and to the table. I stood there, while he ate, making sure that he had everything he needed, like Monika used to do. When Monika complimented me on my food, and told me what good a servant I was, I felt happy and flattered. More than just wanting to emulate Monika's work as best I could, I genuinely found fulfillment in having done a good job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Monika said, &quot;that was delicious. But I got to get off to work. Be a darling and clean up after me, will you? And after that, I've noticed that the kitchen floor needs to be washed. I want you to scrub it, not just use the mop. Down on all fours. And don't try to cheat. You know well the burglary camera covers the room, and I can access that from my computer at work.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to protest, and to ask him if he actually planned to go to work. No matter how he looked, Monika wasn't really me. He couldn't know what he needed to know. Or could he? I had managed to walk well in high heels, to dress myself, put makeup on, and to make breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bathroom also needs some cleaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
At any rate, I couldn't have argued with him. He was so assertive, and I really felt submissive towards him.<br />
<br />
That submissiveness ran even deeper, I soon found out. As I lay on all four scrubbing the kitchen floor, I suddenly noticed that I was exposing my undergarments for the camera. I felt naughty, in a good way. Hoping he was watching, I made sure to wiggle my butt a bit in front of it, and started thinking of what he'd do if he saw me. He couldn't have me doing such things, so he would have to punish me. A good spanking, maybe. I felt like I might deserve that.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it, a hand was between my legs, playing with my new equipment as I fantasised about Monika, as myself, dominating me and dealing out punishment for work not done well enough. The sensations I felt as I neared climax, as if my entire body was on fire with sexual energy, was unlike anything I had experienced as a man. It spread from between my legs and from my breasts, enveloping me, suddenly focusing back in on my pelvic area as all the muscles down there spasmed repeatedly. I squealed in pleasure for every contraction, until drained and covered in perspiration, I lay flat on the floor, my hand still down there, caressing the hair of my pussy's 'landing stip'.<br />
<br />
In the afterglow of the orgasm, I wondered to myself where that lust had come from. Had it always been there, hidden in me? Was it what had, subconsciously, made me do the swap? Or was it something native to this body? Maybe this was what Monika felt all the time? Idly, I hoped for this to be the truth, so that I could initiate the relationship with her I had always wanted once I was back in my own body.<br />
<br />
Fear gripped me. If this was her instincts, and they were growing stronger, then Monika would be getting my instincts. And she would want to dominate me. She would make me her pleasure slave, make me do all those twisted and humiliating things I'd always had wanted to do to her. And she would not want to switch back. The thought filled me with a mixture of panic and, even worse, longing. I ran out to the study, only to find that he had brought the laptop with him.<br />
<br />
Falling to my knees, I started crying in desperation. I didn't want this, it wasn't what I had planned. It was all so wrong. My life had just come apart around me, and I was now my servant girl, soon to be a willing slut for my old self. So vulnerable, so weak, so helpless and lost. I needed someone to hold me, to protect me and guide me, to tell me what to do. No, no, that was not right. I needed to get my own body back, before all these feelings and urges conquered me. But how? I couldn't just swap us back. I didn't have the right to do such a thing to Master Bruce.<br />
<br />
I fell asleep like that, as inside my mind, a battle was fought between what I had always thought of as myself, and this new, submissive personality.</p>
