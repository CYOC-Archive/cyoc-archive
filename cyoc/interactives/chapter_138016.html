<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What did you do?!!&quot; Josh yelled to his brother when he saw the new mr Mendes still jacking off in front of them. Josh was so freaked out, he had no idea what was happening to his mentor or why he was doing that like a crazy. &quot;Revert it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how!&quot; Ric yelled back as he looked through the spell book. He was trying so hard to ignore Mendes&#39; groans to focus in a way to revert it. What he didn&#39;t notice its that the magic was affecting him as well. His clothes&#39; fabrics were turning into tight red lycra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! You&#39;re changing too!&quot; Josh shouted at Ric when he noted the red spandex shorts and t-shirt tightly embracing his brother&#39;s skin. He was 13 so there was no muscle definition, just a skinny body but that was before he began to grow bigger. His arms and legs stretched as gum, his hands and feet did the same until Ric looked like a lanky boy. Then, his legs began to pump with muscle until Ric&#39;s got beautiful strong thighs and calves. His chest went to a similar process, pumping like a balloon and getting defined pecs and abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to do something!!&quot; Rick panicked as he searched as crazy through the book pages. Meanwhile his arms were swelling a little until Ric has the body of a professional cyclist.<br />
Josh was so stunned, if it wasn&#39;t by his face he couldn&#39;t recognize his own brother! But that&#39;s not all, because Josh didn&#39;t note what was happening under Ric&#39;s clothing. The small amount of hair on his body thickened and spread through it, he wasn&#39;t  too hairy but obviously he was a man now, except for one thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help&quot; Ric pleaded when he felt his boyhood transforming and flooding with hormones. As Josh watched Ric&#39;s balls and penis growing, Ric was losing his senses with a sudden rush of new feelings, mainly arousal and ecstasy. Suddenly, he stopped searching and dropped the book, he began to groan in a new deep voice just like mr Mendes did before.<br />
A huge dick shape, maybe 10 inches long, can be seen through the lycra fabric as Ric began to stroke it. He had never masturbated before but he can&#39;t stop doing it now until his first load came out and made a mess inside the shorts. However, that wasn&#39;t enough for Ric and he was still stroking his new manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ric! What are you doing?!!&quot; Josh shouted without noticing his clothing was changing too. He got a cyclist attire faster than the others, blue lycra was embracing his skinny frame.<br />
He tried to stop his brother, but Ric was way more stronger than him now, so all Josh got was to fall on the ground. That&#39;s when he realized he was changing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; He was horrified when he saw the lanky arms and legs coming out from the blue lycra just like it happened to Ric before. He saw his fingers and toes elongating as his sandals reshaped into rubbery shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must do something!&quot; He said as he stood up, his new height unbalanced him a little but it wasn&#39;t until his boyhood began to work its way to manhood when he knew it was useless.<br />
<br />
With no idea about puberty, Josh&#39;s growing hair was a complete shock to him. Itching all over his body, new stenches emanating from his hairy armpits and pubes sprouting and spreading like crazy through his crotch and thighs. He was definitely way more hairier than his brother now.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I got all this hair?!!&quot; He panicked in a deeper manly voice and he covered his mouth after realizing he sounded like an adult. &quot;Please no!!&quot; He finally said before hormones began to do their job and his bulge began to pump through the blue lycra.<br />
<br />
He also reached a 10 inches monster, rock hard inside the tight fabric. Balls big like pomelos flooding in semen for the first time. He groaned and moaned as he kneeled and stroked his new manhood through the spandex. He shot his load so fast the he didn&#39;t even note it, so he kept going.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of two kid and their mentor there was three men jacking off in their cycling outfits in the middle of the living room groaning like beasts in heat. They were so lost that they didn&#39;t hear the front door opening.</p>
