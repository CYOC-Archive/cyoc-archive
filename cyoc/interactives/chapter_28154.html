<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tammia smiled at the loyalty of Alexandra. &quot;Such loyalty shall not go unrewarded,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;She will prove to be a good second body temporarily... however, she does not warrant to have as much power as my real second body.&quot; She touched Alexandra on the shoulder, which immediately caused Alexandra to stand straight up and stiffen. Her body rippled as Tammia's magic did it's work; her hair turned from Raven Black to a color one shade darker than Tammia's platinum blonde. Her fur got more of a sheen, and her body on a whole became much more feminine. Finally, a third tail grew between the two that Alexandra already had. Alexandra's eyes reopened, showing Tammia's gold color; for all intents and purposes she was Tammia's slightly inferior second body. The two Tammias smiled, and they swayed towards Tabra and the concubines, the helpless Karther in tow. The real Tammia shook her head. She had a headache, but from what...? Ah, it didn't matter.<br />
<br />
The castle clay on her ear had reformed back into a wolf's ear and was slowly crawling down her head, and had already changed one of her eyes entirely into a jade color. <br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Tabra and the remaining concubines dashed through the corridor, dodging the wolves coming out of the walls and trying to escape from the transformed wolves behind them. Suddenly one of the concubines, Natalie, tripped and fell. She grabbed her leg. &quot;Damn it!&quot; She shouted, &quot;I think I sprained my leg!&quot; <br />
<br />
Two of the remaining concubines tried to get her up, and Tabra turned around to go and heal her leg. However, several wolves were already forming between Tabra and the three slacking concubines. &quot;Damn it!&quot; Natalie shouted, and pushed the two concubines helping her to Tabra. &quot;Get them out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about you!?&quot; Barbera shouted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about me! I used to be in the army, I can take care of myself. Now go!&quot; Without another word she turned around and dashed straight into the wolves. Barbera and the rest of the group had no choice but to run on. Natalie punched and clawed her way through the wolves even as they engulfed her. She had to buy as much time as possible. She just had to do it.....<br />
<br />
The new Wolven Vixen grinned as she turned one of her arms into a sword. She put her &quot;injured&quot; foot down. Guess it wasn't injured anymore. She melded into the wall, hoping to catch the escapees in a pincer attack.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The survivors ran down the stairs. They were almost to the entrance until.... Tabra stopped the rest of the survivors. She felt a familiar wrenching in her gut except it was now times two. Wait, make that 1.5. She looked around the corner, and partially saw Tammia accompanied by Karther and what looked to be an inferior clone of Tammia. &quot;Come on out, my second body. I can feel your presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra came into the room and noticed it was completely stable. When she saw Tammia's face she gasped and realized why; Half of Tammia's face was now that of a castle wolf, the other half was her original face. Both of her eyes, jade and regular, showed maniacal power and her entire face bore an insane grin. &quot;Come back to me my darling body,&quot; she said, &quot;Then we can be one again and merge with the castle to help serve our lord even better!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn&quot; Janice shouted in her head, &quot;Just how much transformation will she go through!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; T replied, &quot;But considering just how unstable she and the castle are right now, expect for the worst. This might just prove difficult, even for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thanks for the vote of confidence!&quot; <br />
<br />
Before the two could argue anymore, Tammia shot an aura of magic at the angel; Tabra, seeing this before, raised her own aura and deflected the shot. As she regained focus, she saw the crazy queen leap at her, one had turned into a sharp wolf claw. Was she trying to Tabra or kill her!? Tabra shook off her confusion, grabbed the flying queen and hurled her away. She let loose a bolt of holy magic which was unconsciously blocked by Tammia's power. However, that attack made the magic more unstable; the room started to shapeshift like everywhere else in the castle. When Tammia raised her face again, it was fully covered by the wolf. She reached at the wall, and the clay leapt at her. Soon the entire room leapt at her. Tabra and the others gasped as the castle shrunk as it was absorbed by the Tammia-essence. Soon the survivors and Tammia's crew were standing in the desert. As Tabra looked around, she noticed the transformed wolves were still sentient! How could that be!?<br />
<br />
She looked back at Tammia's group as she heard a loud groan. Alexandra had turned back into her original vixen form and was unconscious, and Karther was on the ground. His face was one of fear and he could not help but say &quot;No... no, not that!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was looking at Tammia, who was absorbing the last of the castle. Her body suddenly started to shift. She first turned from an 8-tailed version of herself, to a darker-furred version of Karther (due to the dark portion of Karther's spirit residing in the castle) into a wolven-vixen hybrid. This shifting continued until the new being settled on an 8-tailed, humanoid wolf form with fiery red eyes. Tabra instinctively tried to attack her, but was blasted back by an unexpected power. The new essence - Tamthis - walked towards Karther, who was cowering on the ground shouting &quot;Noooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you like my new form 'My lord'&quot; She said wryly. As she came closer to Karther she raised her hand and blasted Karther with it. Karther changed into a slender, beautiful vixen form. However, he lost four of his six tails in the process as well as his firm muscles, which were replaced by small, supple limbs. &quot;Noooo,&quot; she shouted at Tamthis, &quot;This power is supposed to be mine, not some wolf's! You aren't my queen at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to change that won't I?&quot; Tamthis said, shifting from her female form into a male wolven form; this form was larger and more muscular than the previous, and had the maniacal grin that the stone wolves had earlier. He disappeared, reappearing right next to Karther and pulling her eyes towards his while grabbing one of Karther's new breasts with his right hand. His red eyes glowed with magic, &quot;I will please you no matter what way I have to do it. Now look into my eyes....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I....I can't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!&quot; As Karther was forced to look into Tamthis' eyes, she was overwhelmed by the power of the constantly-shifting being. She desperately struggled to overcome the mental and spiritual shaping, but the magic, combined with both her fear of wolves and the unfamiliar pleasant feeling coming from her chest made her lose all will. <br />
<br />
The new vixen smiled blissfully and put her arms around her new master, her two tails twitching with excitement at what would happen after the survivors were dealt with. &quot;Damn it!&quot; Janice shouted, &quot;I thought that Karther's magic was keeping her from harming him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when she has that much power in her. Remember, she now has Karther's AND the castle's essence in her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamthis turned towards the survivors and eyed Tabra. &quot;Hmm&quot; he said, his grin enlargening more as he gently pushes his new lover aside. As he walked towards Tabra, his body shifted into the eight-tailed Tammia form. &quot;Now it's time for you to become mine again!&quot; She said gleefully, &quot;then we will make Karther happy and share our power with the rest of the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready!&quot; T said to Janice.</p>
