<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first day of school isn&#39;t something dreaded by just students. The teachers and faculties can also dread the end of summer vacation. Of course, that depends a lot on the character of the teacher, whether they enjoy teaching or not. Their reluctance may also be understandable if they&#39;re dealing with a troublesome class, even if it&#39;s one particular student who&#39;d rather make mischief than put any effort into learning.<br />
<br />
The dread of a new school year can also reach up to the principal, or headmistress in this case. Miss Juliet Renard-Argenté had originally started her academy out of her own home for girls who society had given up for their dull wits. It wasn&#39;t these girls&#39; fault that they had trouble with standard school structure. Some of them have been born with mental conditions and the system was less providing to help as their parents could afford the extra needs. That was why Miss Juliet took them in so they wouldn&#39;t end up with menial and degrading jobs, as low as selling their bodies for pleasure.<br />
<br />
Miss Juliet had hoped that converting everyone to Animalians might improve their chances, but now it was feeling like everything was becoming a mockery of what she stood for. A few of her students were now hoping to become sexy maids. The French government were rebuilding her estate into a new Animalian colony, one that was based on a more sexualized version of the Baroque period. Granted, there really were some low-cut dresses in that time period, though probably not that low-cut.<br />
<br />
By this time, Miss Juliet had become more relaxed regarding the sexual nature of Animalians. Trying to repress it too much could lead to it bursting out an inappropriate moment, like when she had a little too much champagne at the Meat Market. There was little point in moderating her students&#39; sexual conduct, especially since they&#39;ve graduated. She just hoped she had enough influence that their ambitions extended further than performing at Belles Bêtes. And she had learned to tolerate the new club that&#39;s been built on her land. At least they kept it classy enough to include a piano lounge where she could provide more sedate entertainment than swinging around on a pole.<br />
<br />
But it was the new students that currently had Miss Juliet so fretful. Like her first class, they were considered &#39;feeble-minded&#39; because they had various learning disabilities that their poorer backgrounds prevented them from getting special care. Miss Juliet was glad to expand her class as her house/academy was also expanded to meet her needs. She was a bit concerned about teaching a mixed class as six boys as well as six girls were her new students.<br />
<br />
She was also a bit concerned for the boys as well. The government and the parents made a few suggestions about what kind of Animalian the student should become if they had trouble making up their minds, though the choice was really up to the students. There was a variety of suggestions for the girls. They could be cats, dogs, birds, rabbits, sheep, several kinds of attractive animals. But when it came to the boys, the suggestions were invariably horse, bull, or donkey.<br />
<br />
It would seem that everyone, perhaps including the boys themselves, had given up hope that they could ever become anything more than field hands and should become beasts of burden themselves. That struck a nerve for Miss Juliet. It reminded him too much of how her brother Jacques had been mistreated just because he was slow. Particularly since that was the name of one of these forlorn boys who seemed to have little say in his fate. Just because a boy doesn&#39;t meet certain expectations doesn&#39;t make him worthless. She had started this school to help those considered lost causes, not condemn them to menial labor just because they had no other option. Ok, she wasn&#39;t trying to make them into university professors or government officials, though in the latter, they could probably do as well as current ones. Even so, Miss Juilet was going to bring out their full capability before the world stamps all the ambition out of them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Miss Juliet insisted on delivering a speech to her new students before any of them converted. She wasn&#39;t going to influence their choices, but she was going to give them enough confidence to make their own minds up instead of just doing what they were told. Standing in front of the still-human students, she didn&#39;t exactly see bright faces. Maybe their expressions were kinda dull, but they mostly looked resigned. Maybe they&#39;ve had plenty of lectures that gave false hope before, but Miss Juliet was going to give them the real thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, class,&quot; she said, not speaking down to them, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been told why you&#39;re here. You&#39;ve been told that becoming Animalians would make you better, healthier, more productive members of society. Though I suppose they haven&#39;t told you why they sent <i>you</i> here. To other people, you may be a burden, someone incapable of taking care of yourself or providing for others. You&#39;ve been sent here because nowhere else can make anything useful of you.&quot; Miss Juliet hated being this blunt with her new students, but she needed to do this properly. First the bandage of false assurance and condescending was ripped off. Now to apply the sooth salve of honesty and hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, I see things differently than those who gave up on you,&quot; said Miss Juliet, &quot;Each of you have a seed of potential that just needs the right sort of soil to be planted in. I won&#39;t tell you that anything&#39;s possible. Not everyone&#39;s cut out to be a scientist or a doctor. However, you&#39;re capable of more than people give you credit for. Some people may think you&#39;re only fit for drudgery, but I say you can aspire to more than that. Perhaps you don&#39;t know what you want out of life yet. That&#39;s perfectly fine, it takes even the best of people years to make up their minds. What I and my staff are going to do is help you realize what you want to be and help you become that. And that means the same for the Animalian forms you choose. You shouldn&#39;t allow others to choose for you just because they don&#39;t think you&#39;re meant for anything greater. No one has to become a beast of burden if they don&#39;t want to. And the form you take won&#39;t define the career you&#39;ll achieve either. So I suggest you take the time to really think of what you wish to be. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you during this school year. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She saw their faces looking more hopeful after her speech, but Miss Juliet didn&#39;t know how much of an influence she was. Some of them might decide to become silver foxes like her. Some of the boys might end up becoming horses, bulls, and donkeys anyways, but didn&#39;t mean they&#39;d be limited to just farm workers. Whatever they become, Miss Juliet was going to make sure their best potential will be brought to the surface.</p>
