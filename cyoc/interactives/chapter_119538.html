<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed examined himself in the mirror for almost ten minutes, caught between aroused and worried at his new appearance. This morning he could&#39;ve passed for 16, albeit rather more hairy than most, but now he looked like a young adult dwarf. Any baby fat had vanished, his stubble-coated cheeks firm and tapered to his cut jawline. The thin patch of hair on his chest now formed a triangle spreading from nipple to nipple and up to his throat, almost connecting to his beard. The treasure trail went from his sternum down to his crotch, spreading around a penis and balls which were almost disturbingly large on his form. Even his musculature had increased similar to his brother&#39;s, his larger muscles comical when compared to his height, which had increased slightly but not enough. Some part of him recognized that he was attractive--albeit in a rough, feral way rather than the conventional one.<br />
<br />
Ed finally forced himself to look away from the mirror when he heard his father get home. He couldn&#39;t believe how easily people accepted this new reality--he was twelve and had a full beard! Yet all his pictures said that this was how things always were, right down to his 8-year-old self already spouting the same hair density he&#39;d seen this morning, even the stubble and chest hair.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure what to do. Yea, some part of him thought that this was VERY cool--his cock had gotten diamond-hard while he examined himself--but his conscience was nagging at him that this wasn&#39;t right. His dad, at least, had been shafted by the repercussions of his choice. It wouldn&#39;t be right to leave him that way.<br />
<br />
Mind made up, Ed headed downstairs. His father looked much the same as he had this morning, thankfully, although that wasn&#39;t saying much; his man-boobs and gut sagged enough to make Ed wince. Any doubt he&#39;d had vanished when he heard the high, weak &quot;Hello son&quot; his father gave him.<br />
<br />
Acting quickly Ed hurried up and hugged his dad, focusing on transferring his enhanced masculinity back to the man. His father seemed surprised at the motion but hugged him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this for?&quot; He asked, his voice already deeper than it was before. Ed pulled away, grinning as he took in his dad&#39;s reshaping form.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was that the fat seemed to melt right off him. At the same time his dad shot up, his height growing until it nearly brushed the ceiling at almost seven feet. His dark hair swept down his face, surprising Ed in that it filled out into a full beard, something his father never had before. The hair continued down his neck into his shirt collar and the growth of chest hair was blatantly clear through the thin cotton, filling in on his arms and hands as well.<br />
<br />
Next his body began to expand in his shirt, but this time with muscle instead of fat. His shoulders grew outward, swelling until they were the size of footballs, and Ed was glad that the shirt was sized for a large man. His dad&#39;s chest and arms followed suite until the sleeves of the shirt were splitting around the bulging forearms and biceps, the thick forest of chest hair not hiding the mountains of muscle. His calves and feet grew until his pant legs and shoes split, giving Ed an up-close view of his father&#39;s final change.<br />
<br />
Although a large part of him was uncomfortable Ed was also fascinated as his father&#39;s cock slithered down his leg, hanging just above his knee when it finished. The thick, dark pubes crawled partway up the shaft, which was as thick and long as Ed&#39;s arm, its obscene size made less noticeable by the rest of his father&#39;s size but easily pushing a foot of fat, veiny, hairy cock.<br />
<br />
Ed swallowed as he stared up at his father. While he could definitely see his dad in the man before him, there was very little in looks to accompany that. His father had been rather handsome before, albeit mostly average, but the thick hair and muscle drove away any traces of that. Everything about this new man was hard, cut, and positively oozing testosterone.<br />
<br />
New-Dad grinned, his teeth appearing blinding with the dark beard around them. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; he asked, his voice so deep it made Ed tremble. He ran a hand up his shirt, casually undoing the buttons. &quot;Tore my clothes again; your mother will never let me hear the end of this. Least I got home this time, eh?&quot; He chuckled and rubbed Ed&#39;s head as he let his shirt fall, revealing him in all his naked glory.<br />
<br />
Ed tried to respond but his voice caught in his throat. Luckily his dad didn&#39;t seem to notice as he turned and made his way towards the kitchen, giving his son a clear view of tight, hairy buns. The moment Ed was alone he leaned against the nearest wall, the breath he didn&#39;t realize he was holding whooshing out.<br />
<br />
What happened? He thought that giving his dad&#39;s masculinity back would return him to normal, not... this! It was obvious that whatever had been happening to Ed and Jacob--the progressive increase in testosterone--had made their dad a full-grown version of them. Apparently in this new life household nudity was a common thing, as his dad didn&#39;t seem bothered to have his son see him naked.<br />
<br />
Ed ran a hand over his face and froze as he felt the rough sandpaper-stubble there. Heart pounding, he ran to the bathroom, outright gasping when he realized his appearance hadn&#39;t changed at all.<br />
<br />
Then it hit him; by making his dad just like him and Jacob he hadn&#39;t reversed the changes, only set them into their genetics. Did that mean the new him had inherited this from his dad? Or, worse, was the addition of his dad&#39;s new genes to his body going to change him even more?</p>
