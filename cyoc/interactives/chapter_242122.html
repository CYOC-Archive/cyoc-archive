<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You keep rummaging around Evan’s belongings, hoping to find some sort of clothing to help conceal your unfortunate stain. Just as you’re getting ready to give up, you spot a dark blue duffel bag laid against the side of the desk. You place the bag on your lap and open it up to reveal workout clothing. You know you shouldn’t be surprised, especially considering how Evan looked, but you still can’t help but be shocked at the prospect of one your teachers being a frequent gym goer.<br />
<br />
You skim through the bag and find that it contains pretty much everything you need to properly change into a more comfortable outfit. But… was it professional? You knew that most students had gone home by now, but wouldn’t it look bad if you weren’t wearing proper attire at your job? You continue to feel the wet stain pressing against your nether regions and instantly decide to go change. <br />
<br />
There was a single-user restroom connected to the teachers’ office room, so you use the strap on the duffel bag to carry it with your shoulder and cover yourself with Evan’s messenger bag before you make your way to it. Once inside, you place the bags on the ground and lock the door. The bathroom looks rather nice and clean compared to the students’ bathrooms. There’s a sink with a huge counter and a large mirror near the entrance. In the corner, there’s a toilet and a trash bin.<br />
<br />
You decide to take off your current clothing first. You take off your blazer and drape it on the sink counter before you unbuckle your belt and start unbuttoning your dress shirt. As you pull off your shirt you find that you’re wearing a white v-neck undershirt underneath (No wonder you felt so hot!), which you promptly take off. <br />
<br />
Looking in the bathroom mirror you must say you’re rather impressed by what you see. Up to this point you haven’t seen Evan shirtless, so when you finally do it’s a sight to behold. Like the majority of his body, his entire torso is smooth except for the small wisps of blonde hair under his armpits. You notice that in spite of his arms appearing thin, his biceps still bulge out a little and that some of the veins that run up his arms pop out. However, that’s not what mostly catches your attention. Your gaze intensifies as you notice how your two pecs nicely jut out from your chest. They’re big and juicy with a pink nipple the size of a quarter on each one. Below them, a lean and defined six-pack rests, not as impressive as your chest but still attractive.<br />
<br />
While examining your reflection, you instinctively pinch your nipples and let out a little moan as the act sends a wave of pleasure throughout your body. “No! I can’t!” you think to yourself as you let go off your nipples and shake you head in disapproval. “I promised myself that I wouldn’t be such a salacious person when possessing others.” <br />
<br />
Taking a few deep breaths you try to calm yourself down while simultaneously ignoring the fact that your dick was beginning to twitch in your drenched boxer briefs. After a minute, you feel turned off enough to resume taking off the rest of your clothes. However, you try not to look too much at your reflection as you do so.<br />
<br />
Taking off your pants and boxer briefs reveal your privates which you had seen quite well just a while ago. Just from pure curiosity, you turn yourself around to look at your posterior. In spite of having a mostly lean build, you appear to have a bubble butt in the back. It was large, smooth, and sturdy, the perfect ass for a twunk. <br />
<br />
Feeling yourself beginning to become aroused, you shift your focus to your exposed legs. They weren’t as thick and meaty as Coach Lucas’s, yet they still felt firm and decently defined. You tensen your calves and feel a good amount of strength in them. It seemed that despite appearing thin, there was still an adequate amount of muscle in your thighs and legs.<br />
<br />
You take off the final article of clothing you’re wearing, a black pair of socks, and let out a deep sigh. Although your original body and Evan’s had some similarities, like being slim and smooth, the differences were far more apparent. Evan was fit, tall, and had a good amount of strength from his developed muscles, even if they weren’t very large. Not to mention, a thicker and larger cock.<br />
<br />
You can only think back on your original body and feel disappointed. Why did it seem that even when you found someone sorta similar to you, their body still surpassed your own? It hurt your self-esteem and left you feeling bad about how mediocre your own body was. <br />
<br />
You shake your head. This wasn’t the right mentality to have, everyone was different and there was plenty to appreciate in everyone’s forms, even your own. You smile as you cheer yourself up with your more positive way of thinking and open the duffel bag on the ground.<br />
<br />
Luckily, you spot a spare pair of underwear and quickly put them on. The red boxer briefs were simply clean and dry, yet they felt heavenly to you compared to the wet pair you had been wearing prior. You then take out a plain black athletic shirt and pull it over your head. It was loose and hung comfortably on your torso. Finally, you take out a light gray pair of track pants and put them on.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at your reflection shows that you still appear mature and professional in spite of putting on Evan’s workout clothing. However, it probably stemmed from the fact that you looked more like a gym teacher or professional trainer rather than an English teacher. You shrug your shoulders and decide that you don’t really care what you’re wearing as long as it’s proper, comfortable, and most importantly, dry.<br />
<br />
You put on a white pair of socks and take out a navy blue set of tennis shoes that you find in the duffel bag. It only made sense to put them on as it would look rather silly to wear dress shoes with your new outfit. After putting them on you’re officially done changing. <br />
<br />
Now finished, you take your previous outfit and neatly fold them before placing them in the duffel bag, along with the belt and black dress shoes. And once that was done, you knew you were ready to head back out. You gulp as you unlock the door. Would anyone question you on why you were suddenly wearing a different outfit? Would they disapprove? You then realize that regardless of what would happen, you would have to face it head on and nodded your head in determination. (Besides, it was better to wear an outfit suited for the gym compared to clothing drenched in piss.) You put the duffel bag’s strap around your shoulder and carry Evan’s messenger bag as you step out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
To your surprise, about 90% of the staff previously in the teachers’ office have already left, leaving the entire room looking rather empty. You walk slowly to your desk and notice that nobody questions or appears confused at your sudden change of clothes. Sitting down at your seat, you let out a small sigh of relief. “No one seems to care. I guess I made a big deal about changing clothes for no reason,” you thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a phone in the messenger bag begins to ring. Confused and alarmed, you open the bag and pull out a phone that you can only assume is Evan’s before seeing the name of the person who is calling him.</p>
