<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max thought about changing more of his family, but decided against that, at least for now. Seeing what would happen to his twin sisters the next day was too enticing to be distracted by any other woman. With that, he went back to his room, wanting to head for the bed. Just before that, he entered one last question as to not cause too much confusion the coming morning.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF HOLLY AND MOLLY COULD NOTICE THEIR OWN AND EACH OTHERS CHANGES, BUT NO ONE ELSE EXCEPT ME?<br />
<br />
Now he was sure the next day would be a fun time. He went to bed and slowly but surely fell asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next, Max was up extra early. He knew that Holly was up a little earlier than Molly, since she unlike her twin sister took her alarm clock seriously. He left his room, only to see Holly walking up to the bathroom, eyes nearly closed since she stood up from bed immediately. With the bathroom door open, she looked into the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY FUCK! WHAT&#39;S HAPPENED TO ME!&quot; she exclaimed, not believing what she saw in the reflection. Molly wrote this off as another case of an inconveniately placed pimple on her face and continued doozing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Holly was positively surprised as she checked out her newly grown body, with Max watching from afar. Whereas before she was 5&#39;6&quot;, just like her twin sister, she now stood proud at an astonishing 6&#39;8&quot;, more than a whole foot taller and a few inches taller than even Max himself.<br />
<br />
Without thinking about the open door, she flexed her now athletic arm and watched a small, hard bump appear on it. She continued by raising her shirt, first revealing a perfectly chiseled sixpack before freeing what appeared to be boobs the size of honeymelons, having no sag to them at all thanks to almost invisible pecs.<br />
<br />
She took a step away from the mirror to take a look at her legs, Her thighs now wide and strong while still leaving room for a thigh gap. She turned sideways and was pleasantly surprised by her toned-as-can-be ass. She flexed it slightly, watching the balls of soft flesh turn into hard spheres.<br />
<br />
She had no idea what was going on, but she loved it. While still liking the changes, she had to go see her mom and tell her that something was obviously wrong. But when she confronted her, her mom seemed confused and stated that she always looked that way and checked if she had a fever.<br />
<br />
While she was doing that, Molly finally got out of her bed and walked into the same bathroom. Opposite to Holly, Molly screamed from the shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL, I&#39;M TINY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max almost couldn&#39;t hold his laughter, his egoistic sister got what she deserved, standing no taller than 4&#39;10&quot;, barely reaching Hollys bountiful chest. But what Holly added as fat on her chest, Molly experienced the same except in her entire body, and much more than Holly.<br />
<br />
What was once a flat stomach now bulged out of her pyjamas, forming an umpleasant curve. Her boobs actually got a bit bigger, but had much sag to them. Same with her butt which wasn&#39;t the tiniest bit of toned anymore. Despite being 8 inches shorter, she weighted significantly more than before.<br />
<br />
With teary eyes, she too rushed to her mother, only to bump into her now larger sister as she dashed around the corner. Her head was suddenly surrounded by firm, but equally soft, warm pillows. After she freed herself of them, she looked up in shock. Her own twin sister&#39;s head was planted on a far too large body, radiating the same amount of feminine energy as it did strength. But both had one thing in common over her sister: The feeling of superiority.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What... Holly? What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could ask you the same thing.&quot; Holly answered, much more calm than her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... You&#39;re huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess all that time in the gym finally paid off.&quot; She said, flexing her upper arms, still being happy to see the bumps rising in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t grow tits in the gym, and not over night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can notice the changes? Weird, mom said I looked the same as yesterday... You seem to have changed as well, but why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if I know! All that I know now is that I&#39;m fat. God damn it, this will take months to burn off again.&quot; She stated, grabbing onto the fat roll on her stomach.<br />
<br />
Max on the other hand kept watching their conversation, enjoying the thought that Molly actually believed she would get rid of any of the fat ever again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the day, Molly kept to herself in their room, taking whatever counted as a weight and used it to train off all the excess fat. She didn&#39;t want to leave the house and go to a gym since she was afraid that all her friends might laugh at her figure. Not like her friends never knew of Molly being anything different than chubby.<br />
<br />
Holly, however, enjoyed this change and went out the whole day, noticing that her friends didn&#39;t notice the change either. She enjoyed the looks and compliments she got. Being nice proved to be the right way to go in life. And she was the living proof. At the end of the day, Holly returned late while Molly was already asleep. She trained way too much and too hard today, so she was tired like never before.<br />
<br />
Max respected Molly a bit more for her dedication, but that wouldn&#39;t help her as it was too late. As soon as Holly fell asleep as well, Max knew what to do...</p>
