<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack leaned against the wall which separated the shower room from the locker room as Terry lied against the far wall. The shower water still running down his…well her new mermaid body. The water felt good but Terry felt terrible as he tried not to look at the large mirror across from him which showed this hot women in a wet T-shirt on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Jack…can you get me…a top from lost and found?” inquired Terry as Jack looked at him for a second. “This isn’t meant to be soaked in.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Jack for a moment, likely judging her size before heading toward the lost and found. People always left swimsuits and other items behind. <br />
<br />
A couple of moments later, Jack came back in and tossed a couple of bikini tops toward Terry who was still lying on the ground. Most where far too revealing for his liking, if he was a guy he wouldn’t see a girl who looked like him now wearing any of these tops but he didn’t want to wear one himself. He picked the most none revealing on and was about to take his shirt off when he saw Jack still looking at him.<br />
<br />
“Turn around.” Ordered Terry as Jack shrugged and turned around. <br />
<br />
Terry lifted his shirt off and saw what was under it for the 1st time. His breasts where small but he already knew that but giving her frame a B size cup was very nice, her waist was thinner then he thought it would be and the scales from her tail formed a sort of V shape with the tips on her hips. It wasn’t a clean line between flesh and scales. There were some patches of silver, white and blue scales near her belly button but for the most part it was clean. He slipped on the top, his hands brushing his new breasts for the 1st time, and she almost gasped at how sensitive they were. <br />
<br />
He fought the need to play with them.<br />
<br />
The top was basically a royal blue sports bra which went to a large band which wrapped around her neck. It was simple to put on and overall covered most of the top, problem was that it wasn’t solid. A large tear drop shaped boob window was located in the middle, giving everyone a good look at some very nice cleavage. Still the swimsuit material was actually designed to be in the water and felt better then the soaked T-shirt. <br />
<br />
While he was putting the top on, he did a few checks to make sure Jack wasn’t trying to sneak a peak. He didn’t turn as far as he could tell. <br />
Taking the risk he reached down to his privates. It looked smooth scale covered area but his fingers found a break in the scales and he had to fight back an even more intensive wave of pleasure as his hands found mermaid hood. <br />
<br />
“Are you done?” inquired Jack<br />
<br />
Terry pulled his hands back and double checked himself in the mirror, the top covered a lot.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Answered Terry as Jack turned around and checked him out.<br />
<br />
“You know if you weren’t my best friend turned into a chick I would ask you out…and of course if you weren’t a mermaid.” Stated Jack<br />
<br />
“Well Fuck you.” Stated Terry giving his best friend the bird.<br />
<br />
“Well, you can now.” Laughed Jack as Terry looked at him horrified. <br />
<br />
“Not a chance in fucking hell.” Stated Terry<br />
<br />
“I agree, lets hope they can turn you back into a human and get this all sorted out.” Stated Jack as the sounds of footsteps outside caused both to look toward the door. A pair of men dressed in hazmat suits entered. They had EMT on the front and back of the suits.<br />
<br />
“Terry?” inquired one of them.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” confirmed Terry <br />
<br />
“Alright, I am with the local EMT team we are going to take you to a center to get treatment.” Said the EMT worker as suddenly a voice came over the load speaker.<br />
<br />
“Attention all guests, please get out of the water we have a confirmed case of the mermaid virus who was in the water.” Said the speaker “Don’t worry we chlorine the water to levels beyond what is recommended by the CDC to kill the virus. Local Police and EMT have arrived, and everyone will be screened as they leave the park.”<br />
<br />
“People will be freaking out.” Stated Jack as the EMTs doubled checked their suits and prepared transport for Terry.<br />
<br />
“Without a question.” Said Terry as he turned his attention from watching the EMTs to Jack.<br />
<br />
That is when he saw it, a small patch of flesh color scales on his friend’s knee.<br />
<br />
“Jack…don’t freak out.” Said Terry as he pointed toward his friend’s leg.<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Jack as he looked down and jumped back. <br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK!!!!” yelled Jack as the EMTs stopped what they were doing and backed away from Jack. <br />
<br />
“Sir…remain calm!” ordered the EMT<br />
<br />
“Calm!” snapped Jack<br />
<br />
“Sir…have you touched Terry or been in the pool water?” inquired the other EMT<br />
<br />
“No…I literally just got here and found Terry!” snapped Jack<br />
<br />
“The water…” said Terry as he noticed the water running off his body toward the drain, with his tail where it was positioned part of the drain was blocked so the water level on the floor went almost to the open doorway separating the shower room from the locker room. <br />
<br />
“Could you have come into contact with the water?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…besides you have to be touched by a mermaid to be infected.” Countered Jack<br />
<br />
“Yes that is what we know about the virus…but lets play it safe.” Confirmed the EMT as he and the other EMT backed out of the room. “Stay here, we are going to put the entire place on lock down, no one in or out. We need the CDC.”<br />
<br />
With that they left the room leaving the mermaid Terry and the now infected but not yet transformed Jack there. <br />
<br />
“Fuck.” Said both of them</p>
