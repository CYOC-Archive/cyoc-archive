<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel shook her head, wanting to quickly forgot these thoughts. As intriguing as it might&#39;ve sounded to take another dose of the serum to turn into a super-duper-heroine, the potential consequences were just too high. Perhaps fabricating a supersuit was the better idea for now.<br />
<br />
She walked over to the machine, thinking about what her suit should look like when she got distracted by something. Beside the machine, she could see a high amount of electricity inside the wall of the basement. Up until now she didn&#39;t know that she could see electrivity like this, but found it to be extremely cool. And useful as she would soon experience.<br />
<br />
She walked over to said spot, wondering what could cause such high amounts of electricity. She bumped her hand against the tiles a few times and suddenly, a small space opened up. Inside, she saw a high voltage stream of electricity flowing around a box. She knew this couldn&#39;t be some kind of normal electricity, it was way to powerful for that. This mechanism was created and charged by her mother to protect that box.<br />
<br />
Wondering what&#39;s inside, now that she was a superheroine like Veronica, Rachel slowly reached for the box. To her surprise, the electricity didn&#39;t hurt at all since she inhabited her mothers powers. She must not have predicted that she would actually gain them as well since it was so vague.<br />
<br />
Rachel pulled out the box and inspected it. It was about as big as a shoebox, but looking much sturdier. The box had a small lock on the front which she broke off with her incredible strength. She opened the box and revealed to herself what was hidden inside. It was...<br />
<br />
...a belt?<br />
<br />
That was it? She hoped there would be more to it, but no, it&#39;s just this. Though she must say that it didn&#39;t look like any regular belt. It was made of a firm metal which looked like shiny silver. It wasn&#39;t bendable for regular humans by any means, so the belt was a bit different than usual ones. The buckle, which was looking more like a big, oval piece of silver, couldn&#39;t be adjusted in any way. The only thing it porvided was an opening for the other end of the belt.<br />
<br />
Curious as to what was so special about this belt, Rachel put it on without thinking too much about it. If only she knew that her mother hid it away for a good reason. After the buckle made a pleasant clicking sound, Rachel knew it was locked. She walked over to a mirror and inspected it a little more. It was a good chunk too large for her now small waist, looking more like a belt meant for men. But after a few seconds, the belt  seemed to move by itself, shrinking down in size until it perfectly fit snugly against her toned waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; she mumbled.<br />
<br />
She turned her lower half a few times, looking at the belt from all directions. Still, she didn&#39;t know what it could do. Not until she accidentally triggered an effect. As she wanted to take it off again, she tried to press down on the buckle from up front, but instead of opening the lock, it emitted a deep green color for a second where she just pressed the buckle and returned to its original color.<br />
<br />
*Cool, it shows some colors. Mom must&#39;ve been keeping this thing for the memories. Maybe it was a gift of my dad?* She thought and questioned herself.<br />
<br />
She laughed it off, but soon after the belt send out a shock through Rachel&#39;s entire body. Though strangely the shock didn&#39;t feel like electricity, but... off somehow.  No matter what it was, it sure was a good feeling it provided.<br />
<br />
Ignoring it for now, Rachel returned to the belt, placing a hand on each side of it to get it off her body somehow. As much as she hated to break her mom&#39;s stuff, she didn&#39;t want to walk around with thing a minute longer. But just as she grabbed the belt, she noticed something about her body. As she looked down, she saw her boobs getting... bigger? And firmer even! Not just that, her lean and toned biceps slowly grew in size as a feeling of power rose in her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be happening!&quot; she exclaimed as she looked back at the mirror. The feeling subsided and she was left with an enhanced body.<br />
<br />
Her already extremely tight black shirt tor apart, revealing probably the best looking set of boobs Rachel has seen yet. As she gazed at her body some more, she found out that almost every single muscle on her body was a good bit larger. Also, she felt a lot more powerful now.<br />
<br />
*So that&#39;s what you&#39;re for!* Rachel thought. *You&#39;re such a genius mom! No wonder you are always so confident about yourself!*<br />
<br />
Rachel believed her mother hid the belt as to not accidentally have it get into the wrong hands. She thought that her mother created the belt in case her powers would someday not be enough to stop a thread or a foe. As much as she believed her own reasoning, she wondered how her mother didn&#39;t use it all the time, given how good it felt to wear and how much power it provided in an instant.<br />
<br />
But as all good things in life, this belt wasn&#39;t what she believed it to be. Sure, Veronica hid it away from everybody, but not only because it shouldn&#39;t get into the wrong hands, but also since it was a device of evil. Veronica didn&#39;t know where the belt itself came from, only that she took it from one of her strongest foes. This belt has granted him such immense power to make her superpowered body struggle in a fight. After she took it away from him, it was clear that the evil man wearing it was actually just some regular, corrupted by its power. Veronica quickly caught wind of that and instantly hid it away in her basement as to never see it used ever again. And that would have happened if it wasn&#39;t for her own daughters insatiable curiosity.<br />
<br />
Rachel reveled in all her newfound power so shortly after she&#39;s just been superpowered. She loved it so much that she couldn&#39;t stop flexing her taut, powerful biceps for minutes. As she looked back at herself in the mirror, a rather interesting thought crossed her mind.<br />
<br />
*Wait, if I got all this just from pressing the buckle, I wonder what would happen if...*<br />
<br />
She reached down for the belt buckle and pressed it like the first time. Just as before, it lit up with its green color for a second and then quickly subsided. And as before, only a few moments later the same kind of shock rushed through her body, only this time it felt even better.<br />
<br />
She watched as her very generous bust expanded further, now being almost as big as her head each. In addition, her biceps grew to the size of tennis balls while her defined midriff deepened with harder sets of abs. Her legs became curvier and also added some muscle mass to them. The only thing that was different from before was that her waist shrunk just a tiny bit more, bringing her up to par with the most perfect looking waists of fitness models.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the strength stored in her shapely muscles increased even more, now clearly being stronger than those of her mother. But, of course, she didn&#39;t know that. All she could think about right now was how good the growth felt and how badly she needed those upgrades so that her mother would finally stop treating her like a helpless little kid.<br />
<br />
She thought about what to do now...</p>
