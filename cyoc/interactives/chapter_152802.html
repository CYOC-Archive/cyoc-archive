<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Will the drug hurt the baby we are expecting.” Inquired Sally as Mike shook his head.<br />
“No, don’t worry about that.” Reassured Mike as Sally and Robert shared a look between each other.<br />
“Alright, lets do this.” Said Robert as they headed toward one of the many desks which was located in the lobby. Like always they always had to fill out paper work for the government and signed a release form. Finally they walked back into the transformation chamber, it was the first time the two of them had been in a centaur building beside the lobby that was. The hallways where larger then normal almost  three or four times the size, large enough for two centaurs to pass side by side or three normal people. <br />
“We will turn you first Mr. Cooper, so please follow me.” Said Mike<br />
“Can I stay with him? I am a nurse?” inquired Sally as Mike thought about it for a moment.<br />
“Very well.” Said Mike as the three of them entered the transformation chamber, it was a large room with a couple pieces of medical equipment. The only thing strange was a harness which hung from the ceiling. “The harness to help make sure people don’t fall, when new legs grow in sometimes people fall over so the harness keeps them upright.”<br />
“Alright.” Said Robert<br />
“Mr. Cooper.” Said a new voice as a female centaur stepped into the room, her hooves echoing off the floor, she wore a white top with a red cross on it, clearly a doctor. “If you would please remove all your clothing and jewelry we will begin.”<br />
“Give us a moment.” Said Robert as he walked up to his wife and placed his forehead against hers. <br />
“Well…here we go. No matter what happens I love you.” Said Robert his voice breaking a bit.<br />
“I love you.” Answered Sally with her voice breaking as the two of them shared a kiss, then slowly Robert took off his shirt, showing off the muscles he had gained from his time in the army and his fire fighting job. After a few minutes he stood there in only his boxers and he took off his wedding ring and handed it to his wife. “I’ll hold on to this until you’re done.”<br />
“Thanks.” Said Robert as they shared one last kiss as humans before taking off his boxers Robert walked toward the harness and was strapped in. It was a simple harness just basically a piece of rope that went under both arm pits. He winced a bit as he was injected and then he looked up at a wall mirror and his wife who stood beside the centaur Mike as they waited for the changes. <br />
They didn’t have to wait long, the first thing to change was his short well-trimmed beard falling out as his jawline smoothed out. His Adams apple disappeared as his lips became fuller and his eyes changed from green to a blue color. His hair grew in length as his brown hair turned blonde, his mother had blonde hair and blue eyes, he had gotten his fathers brown and green eyes so he wasn’t so surprised by that change. The change he wasn’t expecting was him actually growing in height at the same time his muscles seamed to disappear as his strong core became feminine and his arms became slender as well. Then the two things he feared the most, his breasts began to grow up as his dick slowly disappeared into his body. He didn’t want to watch but he didn’t want to close his eyes either, in the end it happened at the same moment, his manhood disappeared into his body forming a womanhood at the same time his breast seamed to stop growing. If he had to guess he had F cup breasts but he now had a much larger body as well. <br />
For a second he was a woman, then his feet started to change, they hardened into a pair of hooves as they began to form into a totally different shape. That is when he felt a slight pop and he turned to see a mound of hair, blonde just like his hair growing out of his ass. He now had a tail but soon he heard more pops. He looked down, trying to get a view past his new breasts as he watched two more pairs of legs grew out of his body at the same time his but began to grow as snow white fur began to grow over his body. <br />
He thought it was nearing the end when he felt two more pops and he looked down to see two more limbs growing out of his hips. His eyes widened as he realized what was happening, he was growing a pair of white feathered wings. He was going to be one of those mythical Pegasus centaurs. Finally it was done.<br />
“My God.” Said Robert speaking with his new female voice for the first time. <br />
“A Pegasus, very rare.” Said the Nurse as she judged him for a moment before moving over to a cabinet and pulled out a sports bra. “Here this will help, it locks in the front easier to handle for those who first turn.”<br />
“You feel ok?” inquired Sally as Robert looked at himself, he was now a blonde hair, blue eyed female Pegasus Centaur.<br />
“I feel, weird but ok.” Explained Robert as he looked down at his wife, Centaurs seamed to be generally taller than humans which made sense considering horses where larger then humans. He moved toward the mirror, taking his first steps on his new hooves and looked at himself studying his face, and looking all around. The only thing that was the same with this body was the army tattoo he had in his shoulder blade, that had made it through the change but nothing else was. “Can I have my ring back?”<br />
“It may not fit.” Advised Mike but they where in luck the ring still fit. <br />
“Alright Mrs. Cooper your turn.” Said the Nurse as she looked at Mrs. Cooper.</p>
