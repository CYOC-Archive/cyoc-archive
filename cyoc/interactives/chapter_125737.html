<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanksgiving Dinner in Animalia took on something more than what it did for the rest of the country.  For large portions of the country, the assorted gatherings were limited to individual families and didn&#39;t go beyond that. Some things didn&#39;t change too much the previous Thanksgiving, but Abby and her friends had all figured that a lot of that related the fact that there were so many things that were so new and Animalia was learning about things like Thanksgiving. Now with a year under their belt, Animalia put more into the holiday and had it more as a community. <br />
<br />
Similar to the party that had been had the year before while Sarah&#39;s parents went on their second honeymoon, the Great Hall had been set up to allow everyone in Animalia to gather and enjoy the Thanksgiving feast. Abby and her family came into the Great Hall to find the main entryway of the hall filled with folding tables and various chairs set up. Near the far wall they could also see a spot where many of the food trays were set up so that they ran perpendicular to the tables where people were seated. Abby also noted that some of the other rooms that were used for conferences and press releases that were done at the Great Hall on the first floor were also on and there were lights that were on, and Abby guessed that those areas were also set up for people to eat at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone&#39;s gone all out,&quot; JT commented as he looked around noting turkey, Pilgrim, Native American, and Animalian figurines on nearly every table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve really wanted to do to try and show the togetherness of the community we have and the things that ALL of us have to be thankful for,&quot; Josephine Brown commented as part of her role on Animalia&#39;s City Council had included some of the planning for the celebration and having all of Animalia stand together.<br />
<br />
And she could see various friends that they&#39;d made since Animalia&#39;s founding already present. Many of them were grouped together with many of their own species groups, as the Browns could see many of the uplifted horses seated together. Though, everything still went along well and politely. Abby even noted that there were a few humans that were also interspaced with many of the Animalians that were there as well, as the celebration had included invitations to not only those living in Animalia but in Lyre as well. In fact at one table, Abby noted Clara and Rick seated not just with their four cubs but Rick&#39;s family and the Mayor of Lyre and HIS family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s still rather nice,&quot; JT commented, still impressed with many of the things that Animalia had done. It was different from much of the country, but there was a lot that was rather similar, &quot;Though... you&#39;re all okay with me eating turkey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no problem with that,&quot; Samson spoke up and put an arm around Abby, &quot;WE can&#39;t have any... but that doesn&#39;t mean we should impose on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And many of the carnivorous Animalians can&#39;t really eat many of the other parts of the Thanksgiving Dinner,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;though I&#39;ve heard some things that they&#39;ve been trying out to make something out of vegetables but would taste like turkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like something to try,&quot; Abby spoke, unable to hide any interest in that. She was fine with having to settle for a herbivorous diet, especially so long as she had Samson, but that didn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t times where she truly missed things like steaks, hot dogs, hamburgers, and so on. In that, having something that could simulate the things she couldn&#39;t touch after she became a Horse Animalian was well worth a try.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You two didn&#39;t have to stay with us,&quot; Julia said to Sarah and Malice in one of the side rooms.<br />
<br />
The main part of the Great Hall had been set up for the main dining area for everyone to dine in, and many were out there to enjoy it. But with Animalia in its second year and many Animalians having had children since Animalia&#39;s founding, there were some rooms that were set up to allow for the mothers to be able to nurse their newborns and infants as needed. The room had areas set up where cradles and were set up and with various special rocking chairs set up that could be placed to allow mothers to be there for their new babies. And Julia Wesley was more than eager to do that with Belle and Bash with Belle to her right and Bash to her left.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re family, mom,&quot; Sarah answered with a smile as she reached over from her dinner to run a finger to caress Bash&#39;s cheek and was soon rewarded with a happy &quot;yip&quot; as the male puppy that made her smile.<br />
<br />
She and Malice were both there for her family. While, she was happy to see Travis and Malice was more than happy to see Simon getting a vacation from the Nevada State Police Academy, and there was some plans that both of them had to be with their bond-mates later in the evening that were more adult oriented that fit their double dosed status and somewhat worked with Sarah&#39;s sixteenth birthday not being too far away, but both Sarah and Malice wanted to stay close by with their parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. That had them staying close to Thomas and Julia, even as they settled into one of the side rooms that were set up so that if Belle or Bash became a bit fussy for food and Julia needed to open the blouse she was wearing to nurse them there wouldn&#39;t be any issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could even help,&quot; Malice offered, &quot;Since everyone&#39;s been vaccinated if you want any break...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas shook his head and gave a low laugh at that while Julia gave a similar sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you for offering to help,&quot; Julia managed a smile to her daughters, &quot;and I thank you staying with us as a family... but Belle and Bash are MY puppies, just as you are MY puppies, even if you&#39;re older...&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few happy barks that soon rose from Belle and Bash which brought some chuckles from Sarah and Malice as well. There wasn&#39;t any aggression in Julia&#39;s voice. But there was some firmness to try and remind Sarah and Malice who the &quot;mom&quot; was in the Wesley family. They smiled and enjoyed being together.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... THIS is a surprise,&quot; Sophie&#39;s mother commented as she came into the Great Hall with her family and Roland&#39;s to find the place pretty busy and packed. There were many Animalians packed and enjoying various meals. This included turkey and other related meals or things that were made to resemble turkey. A lot of that wasn&#39;t turkey wasn&#39;t made to be turkey was made to resemble turkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has made a lot of progress, mother,&quot; Sophie commented as she looked to follow her mother&#39;s eyes and noting the group of Dinotopians gathered on one end with Heather seated calmly with Tyra and the newly transformed Jeremy.<br />
<br />
As they made their way closer,  they also found their way toward where all the Dinotopians were seated with Andrew and Rachel in specialized chairs to deal with Andrew&#39;s height and size and Rachel&#39;s back plates. They also found a row of chairs that were marked &quot;saved&quot; and it was that that really surprised Sophie&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Progress or not... Dinotopian or not, if she makes one threat at either of you, I WILL throttle her,&quot; Sophie&#39;s mother made hear threat clear as they approached and earning some attention from those gathered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need not feel threatened,&quot; Heather spoke as they approached, &quot;I&#39;ve gotten used to all my instincts and now, I&#39;m actually doing quite well. Your daughter&#39;s provided a LOT  of help... and now that I have my own bond-mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather paused and leaned to a side to rub her muzzle to Jeremy&#39;s, though he only paused chomping on turkey to nuzzle her back. Sophie did feel glad that Heather was doing better. She didn&#39;t like being attacked and the attack itself was frightening, but as she learned more from Heather, there was something in Heather&#39;s backstory that she couldn&#39;t have at least some sympathy for. And in the course of Heather&#39;s punishments and working at Horizon as a volunteer for Project Mesozoic, Sophie had seen a lot of improvement in Heather&#39;s behavior. She&#39;d also notice some improvement in Jeremy&#39;s since being around Heather, and that probably lead him to becoming a Dinotopian as well.<br />
<br />
Though Sophie also noticed that it didn&#39;t cut Jeremy&#39;s connections to his own family as Polly and the Whites were on the other side of him. She gave a small wave and moved to sit down at the seats that were saved for her family and Roland&#39;s. They&#39;d have to all go through the buffet line to get their food, but for the moment there was the pauses for introductions, and to her surprise, Sophie found her mother and Roland&#39;s mother soon both looking in awe at Andrew&#39;s height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...?&quot; Sophie asked before trading glances to Roland who only shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Sophie&#39;s mother blinked, &quot;I&#39;m sorry sir... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Andrew smiled, &quot;I&#39;m sure a lot of people are greatly interested in my height and ALL that relates to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;ve been all in favor of supporting Animalia and all...&quot; Roland&#39;s mother began, &quot;and if Roland and Sophie do truly love each other I can be fine with... but... I wouldn&#39;t think it proper to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Sophie&#39;s mother and Roland&#39;s mother both blushed as they realized they&#39;d been ogling the converted sauropod and earning giggles from Tyra. Thankfully, Andrew seemed fine with the attention and their fathers were rather calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Andrew assured them, &quot;it&#39;s something that applies for ANY Animalian, regardless of their species. I just happen to be on the largest end of the scale... And if you joined... you&#39;d gain that similar scale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really aren&#39;t dinosaur people,&quot; Sophie&#39;s father spoke, &quot;We can accept Sophie wanting to fly, I suppose... so long as she understands the choice she&#39;s made... but that&#39;s her decision...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have the money to rebuild our house...&quot; Sophie&#39;s mother spoke...<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a lot of that,&quot; Andrew chuckled, &quot;but the people here have done a lot, even though I have a lot of low ceilings to duck under...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t HAVE to join Dinotopia if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; Rachel spoke up as she looked over to Sophie&#39;s and Roland&#39;s parents, &quot;or even just Animalia... the one thing we ask is simply tolerance and friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is something you don&#39;t have to worry over,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;both our families have been supportive in THAT regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned agreeing nods, though Sophie&#39;s mother kept her eyes on Heather for a moment. Sophie shook her head and then noticed a bit closer that Heather now presently looked closer to being on par with Tyra in terms of size, likely a result of getting her second dose from Jeremy when they mated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you two obviously went through with it,&quot; Sophie said to them, &quot;You&#39;re happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;it was a bit surprising to find out I was only a single doser... but getting my second was lovely... and Jeremy DOES make me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy soon added a small smile of his own, &quot;and she&#39;s made me happy... and really helped me with regard to getting more adept as social situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you&#39;re happy,&quot; Sophie answered.<br />
<br />
Heather and Jeremy both nodded to each other while Sophie and Roland then stood up to go and get their food. As they walked toward the tables where the food had been placed they held hands, knowing that come the end of the school year would include their own conversion. They would have to wait to finish the school year, but in a way they could wait. That wasn&#39;t too bad.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jessica&#39;s family was in another area of the Great Hall as Jessica and Roger nibbled together at various bits of lettuce on their plates and traded glances to each other. It was fun, and Jessica felt the whole situation sort of felt a big family gathering and a sensation of truly being part of a larger community as Judy sat across from them with Sammy and Samantha next to her.  Her parents watched her, but there wasn&#39;t any great worry as they ate, and Jessica had no great worry for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Judy spoke from across the table to Jessica&#39;s parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Jessica wanted to come to be with Roger...&quot; her father answered, &quot;and no one&#39;s complained about the food we brought so... it&#39;s no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In many ways it&#39;s like you&#39;ve all been good friends to everyone,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother answered, &quot;It&#39;s really us who should thank you for being so welcoming to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there was some sense of that for Jessica&#39;s parents. After all, they were both human and had no desire to become Animalians. They&#39;d let Jessica join, as they gave her that much freedom, but there was still a difference the day to day interactions with those who had become Animalians at stores in the work place and events that were special to Animalia. They normally had a pretty quiet and tame Thanksgiving between them and to be invited to such a big event was nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always nice to Jessica... and she was nice to me,&quot; Sammy spoke up, &quot;so... you&#39;re always welcome with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother said politely with some amusement. While she and her husband were well aware of Animalia and the fact that Animalians were just as sentient as humans were, she was still to a certain degree in some awe of how smart many Animalians were simply as a result of the uplifting process. Sure, Sammy had had to go through some remedial training, but Judy seemed to be on par with many of Horizon&#39;s human scientists and the most that she learned was when they were on break and walking outside Horizon&#39;s building and happened to be near one of her burrows. &quot;Hopefully this all shows how well everyone can get along, as I don&#39;t think we&#39;re the only humans here.&quot;<br />
<br />
And they weren&#39;t, of course, there were a fair number of humans who had come as guests and a few news networks had even come as part of a human interest story that related to Animalia and its Thanksgiving celebration. In a sense the shots could serve to help and show what could be done when it was done in friendship. That was a good thing and something both of Jessica&#39;s parents were glad for, as it at least gave them some security for Jessica&#39;s future.<br />
<br />
Though for the moment, Jessica&#39;s focus was more on Roger as they ate. The irony of the fact that Roger had been born a rabbit and had been given &quot;Rabbit&quot; as a last name after his uplifting wasn&#39;t lost on her, but to some extent Jessica didn&#39;t care on that. She&#39;d liked the cartoon and that was actually part of why she went for being a rabbit rather than a hamster when she was looking for a way to show that she was still friends with Sammy. That, however, brought in different interests and she was more than happy have such a kind boyfriend/bond-mate in Roger, and being able to sit with him and nuzzle her Lapine nose to his was what she was thankful for.</p>
