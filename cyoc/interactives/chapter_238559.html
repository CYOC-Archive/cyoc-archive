<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cynthia Robison was pretty famous around school. Not only was she a cheerleader, but she also had a rack bigger than any other girl in school. Her massive breasts drew the attention of many guys and even some girls. While most people would think that Cynthia had an amazing life, that wasn&#39;t the case. Her breasts were too big in fact. While they captured audiences while she performed the immense weight they caused was beginning to her back. Even worse no man seemed interested in her as a person. They just ogled her chest whenever they got a chance. She honestly wished for an opportunity to rid herself of this pain, both emotionally and physically. Little did she know that you were going to give her that.  <br />
<br />
As she was about to leave to study in the library you came over to her. At first, she thought you were just another man wanting to explore her body in private. Instead, she was surprised to be handed a stack of cards. All you said was write what makes you happy and then you were off. Confused Cynthia walked to the library and got out her history book. There was a test later and she didn&#39;t want to flunk it lest she be kicked out of cheer leading. However, her eyes kept glancing at the cards she sat on the table. The top one was titled &quot;TG Questionnaire: If You Were a Guy&quot;. Cynthia thought it was ridiculous at first. However, she knew guys didn&#39;t have back pain from giant breasts so she shrugged. Taking a break from the book she moved it aside and began going through the cards.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 1: If you were a guy... would your handwriting be neat or messy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cynthia thought about this for a moment. &#39;messy but not illegible&#39; As soon as she put the period at the end she felt her hands transform. Her dainty hands became large and meaty. Her long ruby red nails were replaced with short ordinary trimmed nails. She swore there was even a little hair on them. Despite this obvious change Cynthia kept going. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 2: If you were a guy... would you still like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s tough,&quot; Cynthia said aloud. &#39;I wouldn&#39;t like it, but I could tolerate it on other people&#39;. The moment she finished writing, a change took place. Her pink phone case now had a black and blue flame pattern. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 3: If you were a guy... would your hair be straight or curly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;straight&#39; one of her fellow cheerleaders complained about how her curly hair got tangled so she didn&#39;t want to trade one problem for another. Her blonde neck-length hair shrank to a short messy boy&#39;s cut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 4: If you were a guy... what would be your favorite color?&quot;<br />
&#39;green&#39; while blue wasn&#39;t bad she just preferred green since question 2. The color of the phone case changed to green. Her shirt also turned green as did her bag.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 5: If you were a guy... what would your hair color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Dirty Blonde,&#39; her hair darkened slightly as the feminine beauty products you use for it at home vanished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 6: If you were a guy... what would your eye color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;green&#39; why wouldn&#39;t it be her favorite color? Her eyes irritated her making her blink several times. When it stopped her brown eyes had become an emerald green. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 7: If you were a guy... would you work out regularly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;yes, I go to the gym whenever I can&#39; She didn&#39;t want to be thin or fat so being jacked made the most sense. She had already worked out to keep her cheerleader body. However, she forgot how muscled a guy can be. First, her muscles in her forearms swelled followed by her biceps. If it weren&#39;t for the power of the cards her shirt would&#39;ve been ripped by her widening shoulders. Her massive beasts were quickly sucked into her growing pecs. They protruded a great deal but thankfully it wasn&#39;t as large as her breasts had been. Her nipples shrank and became less sensitive. To her greatest relief, her once-hurting back muscles grew stronger as the changes went down her torso. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 8: If you were a guy... would you be sporty?&quot; <br />
<br />
While she loved cheer leading and performing at the football game, she didn&#39;t want to change one for the other. &#39;Yes, I&#39;m still a cheerleader even as a guy.&#39; she gained noticeable calluses on her hands as she gained an eight-pack. While her butt wasn&#39;t as large or gave her as much problem as her old chest she wasn&#39;t exactly upset it was gone. Her skin tanned as it got tougher. Cynthia&#39;s hips rearranged as her thighs grew larger. The changes stopped right below her calves. Her feet looked massively disproportionate for the time being. Thankfully that would be rectified soon.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 9: If you were a guy... what kind of shoes would you currently wear?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Cross trainers&#39; underneath her larger shoes and socks, Cynthia&#39;s feet began to change. They became meaty and large, and the nails on them faced a similar fate to the ones on her hands.    <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 10: If you were a guy... would you wear a suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;only during upscale parties or important celebrations&#39;. Back home, her dresses became suits in black, blue, or dark green.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 11: If you were a guy... would you be manly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;most definitely, however, I still love being a cheerleader&#39;. Since it was what she was passionate about in life she didn&#39;t want just to give it up. However, she soon began thinking of how beautiful her fellow cheerleaders were. Her feminine thoughts soon switched to manly ones. She couldn&#39;t help but glance toward the hot librarian at the counter. She had seen several guys look at the lady before seeing her chest. Now she knew those guys had taste.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 12: If you were a guy... what would be your &#39;package&#39; size?&quot; <br />
<br />
This was it, no going back. Seeing as this was a one-way trip she wrote &#39;eight inches&#39;. Cynthia immediately felt pain as her sexual organs rearranged. She was forced to spread her legs to be comfortable as they changed. The eggs in her ovaries became sperm as they became testicles. Once her pussy seals shut her clot surges in her panties. While it grew her uterus and Fallopian tubes disappeared. Her cervix follows suit as her bladder connects to her increasing penis. It became uncircumcised as an oping appeared on its head. The womb was the last trace of her previous sexual organ, once it was gone Cynthia was officially a man. He looked down and was embarrassed to see himself with a throbbing erection. He could feel his large balls hanging from his underwear&#39;s leg-holes and his cock poking up beneath his shirt. It was clear panties weren&#39;t fit to hide such an organ. &#39;maybe I went too far&#39; Cynthia said. She tried to pick up the card again only to find it was now stuck to the rest of the ones she previously answered. With no choice, Cynthia decided to go on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 13: If you were a guy... would you be straight, gay, or bisexual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;straight&#39; he was already thinking about girls so being straight made sense. In an instant, all that staring he had received from men meant nothing to him. Instead, he found himself dreaming of meeting his perfect female companion. He dreamed of stripping off the librarian&#39;s clothing and plunging his cock into her dripping pussy. He was jolted out of it when he felt his cock let out a bit of pre. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 14: If you were a guy... would you shave often?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I would have a clean-shaven face but the rest of my body would be impressively hairy&#39;. A thin layer of stubble spreads across Cynthia&#39;s face and neck, his Adam&#39;s apple coming into being as the hairs pass over the spot. His eyebrows thickened as his eyelashes shrank. His eyes readjusted in his changing head. While this happened his nose grew and his lips thinned. Cynthia&#39;s makeup was gone in an instant. If it weren&#39;t for the power of the cards one would think Cynthia had a twin brother now. However, the changes weren&#39;t done just yet. Across his body, a massive forest of hair grew. It was incredibly thick across his pecs, armpits, pubic bush, and balls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 15: If you were a guy... would you use cologne or hair gel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;only on special occasions, simple deodorant will do for day-to-day things&#39;. The perfume emanating from him vanished in an instant as did the bottle in his purse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 16: If you were a guy... what type of shirt would you currently wear?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;green sweatshirt&#39; Given the cold front today it made sense to be comfortable. The fabric of his shirt changes as the sleeves get longer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 17: If you were a guy... would you wear briefs, boxers, or something between those?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;briefs&#39; he wrote. Instantly Cynthia felt his ill-fitting underwear transform. They turned back as his cock and balls were kept inside. Of course, he still had a boner but he can deal with that later. Additionally, his skirt became grey sweatpants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 18: If you were a guy... rate how smart you would be: zero being a complete idiot and ten being smart enough to rival the class nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cynthia shrugged. She had a big test, and it would be interesting to have both brain and brawn. &#39;Ten, knowledgeable in both school and the street&#39;. His brain hurt as information flooded in. Despite his increased intelligence, he found he was still the same person, just smarter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 19: If you were a guy... how old would you be, and what would your height or weight be without shoes or clothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;16, would be 6&#39;4 and weigh 400 lbs.&#39; Cynthia&#39;s height rose as her muscle mass changed slightly more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Question 20: If you were a guy... what would your name be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Cyril&#39; he wrote. With that Cyril put the last card down. That seemed to cause a ripple in reality. Cyril now remembered his new life. It was oddly not too much different from his old one. However, he remembered studying and going to the gym more than he did as Cynthia. Looking at this amazing deck he wondered which girl he should give it to. Perhaps it could even change a guy into a girl. With that in mind, he gave it to...</p>
