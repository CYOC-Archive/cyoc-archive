<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Rise and Shine!”<br />
<br />
The blazing sun had turned Benji’s tent into an oven. The boy was lying over his sleeping bag, with limbs spread out in all directions. He awoke to see Matt’s head poking through the entrance, who was hungrily eyeing him back. That was when he realised his morning wood was in full view, covering it up immediately as he turned bright red. Matt took a deep breath in, as if he was an addict trying to get high.<br />
<br />
“Smells great in here. Probably best to have a wash so Al doesn’t complain.<br />
<br />
Matt winked as he disappeared from view. Benji could feel his face dripping with his sweat. He found himself getting turned on by his own musk, and quickly vacated the tent. On his way out, he grabbed a towel from his rucksack, and strategically held it over his boner, which had grown another inch since last night. It stretched the fabric of his shorts. The necklace reflected the bright sunlight onto Benji’s now hairy neck. It felt so light, he forgot he even had it on.<br />
<br />
A small fire crackled by a large metal pot, yet the blazing heat of the jungle remained unaffected. Alistair stood by it, holding an empty bowl. He wore a tight pair of shorts and an even tighter shirt, with his towel hanging around his neck. Benji had never noticed how buff his leader was. He felt his morning wood throb. Alistair smiled as he saw the boy emerge from his tent.<br />
<br />
“G‘ morning Benjamin. Woah, someone needs a shave.”<br />
“Do I-oh…”<br />
<br />
Holy shit, Benji thought. His voice sounded deeper, as if it broke overnight. He placed his palm on his cheek. Even more hair had sprouted. He never realised puberty was so fast-acting.<br />
<br />
“Going for a morning bathe I see? Well, today’s gonna be a scorcher so you know what that means; summerwear!”<br />
<br />
He pointed proudly at his clothes. Benji looked at the man’s muscular chest and gritted his teeth with lust. He secretly wished Alistair’s summerwear was like the twins, who were expertly dismantling their tent in nothing but their underwear. Benji went to the lake, and took the first step in. The cool water soothed his toes. It was like a massage. He heard the calming noises of the water peacefully gliding against small pebbles and rocks. That was when he suddenly heard Alistair’s voice from behind him.<br />
<br />
“You’re not going in with clothes on, are you? We don’t have time to dry them before we leave. Don’t worry, we’re all men here. No one’s watching.”<br />
<br />
Benji turned to see Matt and Tom eagerly watching, one of them rubbing their arms which had grown tired from the packing. The boy sighed, and tossed his towel towards his tent. He slowly peeled off his vest, and his sweaty, bare torso felt the jungle’s hot air. As he looked down, his mouth fell open. The boy had always been skinny, but there he could distinctly make out two moderately sized slabs of meat on his torso. Pecs. Below them were something even more unbelievable; small lumps of solid muscle leading into his shorts. Benji had always dreamt of having a six pack, and there it was. He ran his hand down it, his fingers moving along the bumpy surface. His arms looked fuller, with biceps more defined than last night. It was as if he had buffed up in the span of a few hours. He could see more hair on his pecs this time, a thicker patch that he grabbed to make sure it was real. All that was left were his shorts, which he removed with a sense of eagerness. The twins checked out his ass. Perfectly round and bulbous. The boy grinned at his hardon, cupping his balls which had almost doubled in size. He laughed silently to himself in disbelief  as he ran into the water, his hot skin quickly being cooled. The twins watched his ass bounce as he ran before resuming their packing.<br />
Once Benji was neck-deep in the water, he could finally explore his new body. His muscles felt great as he flexed them for the first time. He reached his arms behind him and grabbed his cheeks, almost jumping in surprise to how sensitive they now were. His attention quickly drawing to his steel rod, which was aching for release. He grabbed it with both hands and pumped it rigorously. Benji threw his head back and shut his eyes, relishing the experience. He was having the best orgasm he had ever had, and could feel that he was getting close.<br />
<br />
Then, out of nowhere, he felt something collide with his cock.<br />
<br />
He jumped back at this shape before him, holding his arms up in defence. Then, a head bobbed up from the water. Reggie’s wide eyes was staring back at him.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I should’ve looked where I was going…”<br />
<br />
An awkward pause fell between the two. There were only inches between the two, and could hear their breathing amongst the sounds of the water. Benji had held his hands over his cock, as Reggie tried to avoid looking at him in the eye. His wet hair had fallen perfectly over his handsome face. Then, after a few more seconds, the man swam around him and emerged from the water. Benji watched as Reggie’s broad shoulders followed his head, with impressively muscular shoulder blades and a perfect V-shape. His ass looked like he had been doing squats his entire life. It was covered barely by a tight pair of black speedos. He turned to look back at the boy, as if he was going to say something. Benji noticed the man’s hefty package hang in the swimwear. It looked like Reggie was semi-hard.<br />
<br />
“I…sorry.”<br />
<br />
Reggie stuttered as he made his way back to his tent. Benji resumed jerking off, this time keeping an eye out for anything swimming towards him. He inhaled quickly as he felt a huge wave of ecstasy shoot through his veins. It was unlike anything he had ever felt before. He moaned as large loads of his cum spurted out from his cock, spreading throughout the lakewater like roots of a tree. He took a few deep breaths as his boner subsided. He noticed Alistair talking with the twins, one of them grinning widely as the boy briskly walked out of the water and to his towel. Once Alistair left them to pack his things, Matt casually walked towards Benji, his wide chest blocking out the sunlight<br />
The naked 18 year-old felt slightly vulnerable as the giant leaned slightly towards him, as if to get a good look. Without speaking, Matt placed one of his palms on the boy’s head, and then moved it in a straight line to meet his chest. It reached the same level as his nipples. Then, he walked away, leaving Benji slightly confused. However, he dismissed it, going into his tent to change and prepare for the long day of walking.</p>
