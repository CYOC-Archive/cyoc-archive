<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin parked on the street just down from the alley. Kevin grabbed the keys,  opened the door, and got out of the car. Kevin saw the wet spots on his dark leather seat, and sighed deeply, then locked and closed the door. Kevin walked quickly to the alley and turned down. Kevin felt so full, he had to pee now. He knelt between a stack of crates and the building, and relaxed. Two blobs of lube, one from his pussy and the other from his ass, slowly fell to the ground.  Kevin leaned against the wall as he squatted, letting his body drain as much as possible before standing up and resuming his quick pace to the shop door. The inside of his legs was now coated in his slick juice, and his quick pace did not cause any further chafing.<br />
<br />
Kevin opened the door and stepped inside the shop where he purchased the box. The George Hamilton look-a-like was standing behind the counter. Kevin walked up to the counter and asked, &quot;Hi. I purchased a box yesterday, I was with an older woman. You had her put her clothes in the box and then put them back on. Do you remember me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man behind the counter smiled, &quot;I remember an older couple sir. You do not fit that description.&quot; The man was right, Kevin was looking more like a man in his mid-30&#39;s than his mid-60&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;The box did this, I don&#39;t know how, but you said when we were leaving that I would be the only one to notice.,&quot; Kevin said in a fast pleading manner.<br />
<br />
The man nodded, &quot;Thank you sir.,&quot; then the man handed Kevin a card, &quot;Are you happy with the box?,&quot; asked the man.<br />
<br />
Kevin took the card, with the name of John and no last name. &quot;John, look, the box is fine. I just need to know what is going on, I need some answers. If you want money, I have money.&quot; Kevin took out four $100 bills and slid them across the counter. &quot;Please, I came here to get information.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took the money and rang up a no sale to put the money in the cash drawer. John went to the other end of the counter and asked, &quot;Sir, please follow me. Allow me to introduce you before you speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took Kevin into the back, down a hallway and to a closed door. John knocked, and a deep voice inside said to enter. John opened the door and the two went inside.<br />
<br />
Kevin saw a desk and a desk chair with it&#39;s back to the door. John went around the desk and leaned forward and whispered to the whomever was in the chair. John stood up and returned to Kevin&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
The deep voice in the chair said, &quot;My partner has told me you seek more information. We value satisfied customers in our shop, and my partner did not tell you all that you needed to know. He does a very good job of attracting satisfied repeat customers, but this is the first box he has sold. It has different rules. You must go now, and return in the future when your body is not in estrus. To make things right, John will give you a full refund, and feel free to ask for anything in the store or we can obtain it if we do not have it in stock. Your money is no good here. Now please go with John.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took the door knob of the open office door and directed Kevin to leave. The two returned to the counter where John rang up a no sale and handed Kevin five $100 bills. John sighed, &quot;My sincerest apology sir. Here is my partner&#39;s card. This is his direct line, please call anytime with questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin looked down at the card, only a phone number and the name of the shop were printed.<br />
<br />
John then offered, &quot;Please take anything in the store, or call in what you would like. My partner insists, and I have never disappointed in having satisfied customers of our business. I have four more things to tell you about the box.<br />
First, you will be aware of the effects of the box and it&#39;s contents on others and yourself.<br />
Second, the documents for the box are created by putting paper or wood into the box.<br />
Third, you and your lady friend are welcome here anytime, to us you are both our customer.<br />
Last, the documents you read do not impart any power, but my partner and I can assist only you in that endeavor.&quot;<br />
John bowed his head and stepped back from the counter and into the back, then returning with a box of fifteen reams of paper. John then said, &quot;I can carry this to your car if you can show me where you parked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin asked, &quot;Can I use your restroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
John escorted Kevin back to a curtain, &quot;If you would use the can, I will empty it when I return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin was ready to burst, and did not argue, sliding behind the curtain and squatting over the large can. After a few large globs, he felt empty enough to stand. There were no paper towels or tissue rolls. John handed Kevin a small hand towel through the curtain. &quot;Thank you.,&quot; said Kevin. Kevin wiped off and opened the curtain. <br />
<br />
John said, &quot;Keep the towel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin followed John back to the front, &quot;Thanks, it will come in handy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked to Kevin&#39;s car, where John put the box in the back seat and continued to remind Kevin to call for anything, and he would deliver it to his home personally. Kevin shook John&#39;s hand and Kevin put the towel down on his seat and when Kevin looked around, John was already gone.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt the pressure build again as he made his way home. Kevin felt time was short as the garage door was closing and he quickly got out of his car, grabbing the towel he sat on,  squatted over the trash can he had next to his workbench. Kevin knew it was a lot of this time, the pressure was coming sooner with each cycle. He finished with the trash can, and wiped with the towel, and took the box of paper and towel in his back seat to his bedroom. He opened the box and put the first ream, unopened, into the box and closed the lid. He opened it after only a couple of seconds and inside was an ornate, leather bound book. Kevin pulled the book out of the box and saw the title, &quot;Instruction Documents for TDPC-06s,&quot; then put the book on his dresser.<br />
<br />
Kevin took off what clothes he had, grabbed the book and sat down on his toilet. Kevin thought if he was going to be reading a while, this would be his most comfortable spot.</p>
