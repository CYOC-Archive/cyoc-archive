Elsewhere… <br />
<br />
While the Stovalls were having their “eventful” night, the Anderson boys were both lying their respective beds thinking about their chosen girlfriends. Or in Nate’s case, lack thereof. <br />
<br />
Nate hoped that, with some help, Kenya might get over her apparent addiction to sex. And if that was the cause behind everything, then maybe they could get back together. And take things at a snail’s pace. <br />
<br />
Nate still didn’t know how he felt about her. Or how she felt about him. No matter how many times Kenya told him she’d turned down the marriage proposal, something about the entire situation just didn’t sit right with Nate. <br />
<br />
And he planned on asking her who the guy was the next time he saw her in person. Which wouldn’t be until the weekend. At least he still had his date on Thursday to look forward to. THAT, at least, Nate knew wouldn’t be as complicated. Who knows, maybe he and Liv would hit if off. Course he knew next to nothing about her, but then again he didn’t know that much about Kenya either. <br />
<br />
Neither Nate nor Eric realized the irony of their situations. Both had exes that had, more or less, an addiction to sex. At least Nate didn’t have to worry about her jumping him in the school parking lot. <br />
<br />
No, he had to worry about her one day deciding to go back to the guy who proposed to her, thus breaking his heart again. Truth be told, he’d rather have Kenya trying to yank his dick off than that. Heartbreak hurt a thousand more. <br />
<br />
Across the hall, Eric was busy lying in bed thinking about his future plans with Spencer. Hopefully things between Frieda would work out, and by the end of the year he’d be a were. On the off chance things didn’t work out… Well he could wait a bit longer. And if not, maybe he’d just ask one of the local she-wolves to turn him and that would be the end of things. <br />
<br />
Eric certainly didn’t want to go around normal for too much longer. Not with Julie prowling around and grabbing his junk every chance she got. Eric wasn’t so much scared of her, as he was stunned she would try something so insane. In the months he’d been with her, yes she’d been pushy, but never this “sex-hungry”. If this was how she really was, Eric was glad he broke up with her. <br />
<br />
“Anything else on your mind?” Spencer’s voice jolted Eric back into his bedroom and out of la-la land. He completely forgot Spencer was watching him, granted through a webcam. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. Should probably go to bed now. It’s getting pretty late. Can’t have you missing any more school can we?” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, only three weeks until Christmas break.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
“And then five more months of school.” Eric reminded her. Spencer groaned and pouted. The face she was making made Eric squirm uncomfortably. He knew she wasn’t trying to, but Eric was still turned on a little. Thankfully Eric heard Spencer’s father shouting at her to go to bed and turn her lights off. <br />
<br />
“Oops, guess my time’s up.” Spencer said sitting up. With nothing but her underwear on, Eric bit his lip to keep his bruised cock from rising any higher than it already was. It was really starting to hurt, not just from the bruises. <br />
<br />
“Love you.” <br />
<br />
“Take care of Little Eric for me. Can’t have him breaking before I get any use out of him.” Spencer winked before the screen went black. Eric sighed, and looked at his lap. He didn’t dare touch his bruised organ, but the blue balls weren’t comfortable either. <br />
<br />
Eric heard Nate’s door open and close. In need of a distraction, Eric slipped his pajama pants on and slowly walked down the hall. <br />
<br />
Unable to sleep, Nate decided to go downstairs for a change of scenery. He’d been staring at his ceiling for what seemed like hours. Thankfully his parents were asleep in the basement. Nate went through the refrigerator and scavenged a sandwich from leftovers. Which was around the time Eric showed up. Holding an ice pack to his junk and looking a little flushed. <br />
<br />
“Thought I heard you come down. Couldn’t sleep either?” Eric pulled a chair up next to Nate at the counter. <br />
<br />
“Ya. My brain wouldn’t shut up.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“I know the feeling. So what’s eating you?” Eric asked, then reached over and popped a piece of turkey from Nate’s plate into his mouth. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. Do you think it’s possible for weres to be nymphomaniacs?” <br />
<br />
“Well, and this is just based on my encounters with Julie, I’d say yes.” Eric’s boyhood quivered at the very mention of the injuries. <br />
<br />
“I think Kenya might be too.” <br />
<br />
“Really? You’re not just saying that because she was a prosti, uh an escort.” Eric corrected himself after a look from his brother. <br />
<br />
“No. But that’s like the only thing she wants to do. That, and watch me cook. Don’t ask.” Nate said as Eric opened his mouth to ask what that was about. Though he did kind of understand. Spencer seemed fairly fascinated with his culinary skills too. <br />
<br />
“I suggested she talk to Francis. Well actually I TOLD her to talk to Francis. If she wants us to try and work things out that is.”<br />
<br />
“Do you?” <br />
<br />
“I guess. Everyone deserves a second chance. That doesn’t mean much of anything will come of it. Truth be told, I don’t have high expectations.”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Eric was under the impression Kenya just made a mistake. A very big, stupid mistake, but a mistake all the same. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. Intuition? Kenya’s great and all, but there’s still the matter of the guy who proposed to her. I don’t know anything about him. She could go back to him, shit she might be with him right now! I mean, you don’t just turn your back on a guy who buys a diamond the size of an almond. I wouldn’t.”<br />
<br />
“You really don’t know anything about him? I mean, besides that he’s a were and probably loaded based on your description of the ring…” Eric could only image what it looked like. He assumed Nate was exaggerating a little. That still left the mental picture of a fairly large diamond in his mind. <br />
<br />
“Nothing. He lives in Seattle, and is some lonely bachelor who can afford to buy the women he sleeps with. And I’m just…” Nate grumbled. <br />
<br />
“A literal teenage werewolf?” Eric finished the thought with a smile. Nate rolled his eyes, but appreciated his brother trying to cheer him up. Was nice to know they could have a conversation without things ending in a fist fight. Which Nate would most definitely win. He always won. At least as far as things with his brother went. <br />
<br />
Nate’s luck with women seemed inexistent.</p>
