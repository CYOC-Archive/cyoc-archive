<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>The girl whispers, "Follow me," and heads for the nearest door to the back halls. I knew that we weren't suppose to go back there 
but hopefully the Quondams wouldn't think to look for use there.</p>
<p>The girl stopped to make sure I was following her and evidently being satisfied she heads to the stairs and starts climbing. She 
seemed to know where she was going so I just followed her. I was afraid that someone would spot us back here and I expected to hear 
the shout that would indicate someone had seen us at any moment. If we were caught then we would be taken to the security office and 
I was sure the Quondams had given my picture to the security guards. I didn't know what would happen to the girl if she was caught but 
I thought it would be the same as what would happen to me. That is our souls would be ripped out of our bodies and placed in 
something else.</p>
<p>"Here," the girl said bringing me out of my thoughts. She opened the door and went inside. I followed hoping this would be a 
relatively private place. Turns out it was a storage room for Christmas decorations so we shouldn't be disturbed. The girl dropped her 
pack and began pacing. After a few moments she took a book out of her pack and opened it. I was curious about what it was so I 
started to move a bit closer. She motioned that I could take a look at it if I wanted to so I did. As I was she moved some heavy things in 
front of the door. She engages the lock and turns back to me saying, "Now we shant be interrupted any time soon."</p>
<p>The girl came back over and looked at the book again. She seemed to be making sure that she knew what she had to do in order to 
make the spell work. Picking something up she drew a door on the wall. I glanced back at the book and reread it seeing that one had to 
draw a door for the spell to work. "Whatever your decision, when we are done talking, I am casting that spell and going through the 
door," the girl said.</p>
<p>I looked up from the book and asked, “Why do you have to go through the door?”</p>
<p>The girl got a flustered look on her face for a moment. Then she paused and sitting down she whispers, "That involves a long and 
complicated story. One I am still coming to terms with and at some parts, find so incredible, they are hard to believe." She sighed and 
then started explaining with, "My story begins with a girl named Heather and another named Katrina..."</p>
<p>Over the next hour and a half she explained everything that she knew to me including how she might have been named Tommy at 
one point and now she was named Libby. After she had finished she was silent for a bit then said, "I'm going through the door because 
of all that I have seen and all that has happened around me. And because I believe it is the right thing to do."</p>
<p>I digested the information she had provided me. Since I had runaway I had started remembering my true life and now more of it 
came back along with bits of the life I had previously. I wanted to see justice done for Isis and Inari erasing me from existence. I smiled 
and said, "Well if it will help stop Isis and Inari then I'm coming with you. Hopefully the Quondams or Isis and Inari won't be able to 
follow us."</p>
<p>Libby nods and looks at the spell again. Once she was evidently satisfied she closed it and put it in her pack. Shouldering her pack 
she faced the door outline and began to chant.</p>
<p>Wind begins to swirl around the room with Libby at it's center. Behind me someone started pounding on the door which startled me. 
I wanted to tell Libby to hurry up but I knew she needed to concentrate and my telling her that would only be an added distraction. She 
seemed to understand the situation though as she began to chant faster. The wind picked up some more as the outline of the door 
began to glow. Then with a thunderous boom that leaves a ringing in my ears the wind dies and the outline becomes an actual door.
</p>
<p>Libby glances back at me and moves toward the door. When she touches the handle the pounding increased. She opens the door 
and I can see a white room beyond it. I hesitate for a moment upon seeing it and Libby steps through just as a loud crash is heard 
behind me.</p>
<p>I instinctively turn around to see a couple of male Quondams enter and one grabs my arm. The other looks angry and says, "The 
other one has escaped for now but we have the runaway."</p>
<p>"This is another one from the prophecy isn't it?" the one holding onto my arm asked like I was just an object.</p>
<p>Well I wasn't just going to let myself be dragged off and have my soul ripped out. I didn't like being thought of as just an object 
either so I did what any girl should do in my situation. I swung my leg around with all I had and kicked the one holding me square in the 
groin causing him to let go and drop like a stone. The other one looked stunned which gave me time to run to the door. I heard 
footsteps running behind me and almost catch up to me before I made it through the door.</p>
<p>As soon as I went through the door pain ripped through my body. I felt my bones shift slightly giving me another face and body. The 
face and body I had before going through the mirror.</p>
<p>I had closed my eyes when the pain hit me and now I opened them to see a woman smiling as the woman says, "My name is Beth 
Milanksy and I am a teacher for you and the girl behind you."</p>
<p>"You killed Janet and her family!" I yelled out at her tears streaming down my face.</p></p>
