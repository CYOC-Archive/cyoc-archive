<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A chilly shower could ease the agony but did nothing to wipe away those memories of Byron the stallion, an alley in Chinatown, and what the horse had and used his big cock to make real.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed Will's thoughts were on what the ole' man had spouted about the stallion being a man once and now was a stud. The more he thought about it the harder it was to remain comfortable with wearing tighty whitey, jockey shorts.<br />
<br />
Trying his best to put his daytime experience out of his mind he drove over to Megan's apartment. <br />
<br />
A ring of the doorbell and Megan greating Will with her dynamite smile made his sexy thoughts change channels. A drive into the outer suburban grasslands and to Garfield's Restaurant &amp; Eatery.<br />
<br />
Seated by a window which looked out over the wide open spaces still around the bustling city suburbs, they sat enjoying a great steak dinner. The mood was perfect and both feeling happy decided to walk the nature path offered by the restaurant.<br />
<br />
Hand in hand together they walked, talking about their day but Will holding back his most sensual experience. They soon came to a small creek and sat together on seats there on the walkway's bridge.<br />
<br />
The bottle of special enhancement potion was there in Will's pocket as he could feel it pressing against his thigh.<br />
<br />
A deep searching kiss from Megan was all he needed to spark his wild passions. The two engulfed the other in hugs and a long kiss as Will and Megan got very excited.<br />
<br />
Breaking her kiss Megan stood up and took off on a run from the bridge and up the nature trail. Will stood up wondering and then realized she wanted him to follow.<br />
<br />
Megan having run the Boston marathon twice before took a good lead on chubby Will. His big dinner did nothing to help him running after his lover and soon had him winded and bent over about ready to puke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your out of shape there my dear!&quot; chidded Megan as she jogged past him heading her way back toward the bridge.<br />
<br />
Will was feeling pretty down as he'd have to agree he was not in the best of physical condition. Then he thought of the small bottle and it seemed a perfect time for something which boasted of being a enhancer.<br />
<br />
A pop of the cork out the small bottle and with a high tipping of the bottle Will chugged it down in two swallows. Suddenly he felt a warm surge in his guts as if loaded with energy. Quickly he started to run after Megan his agility and pace of running increasing with every stride.<br />
<br />
Around a turn in the path he saw Megan far ahead and as she turned left and out of sight he heard her scream. <br />
<br />
Now he thought his love to be hurt or in trouble and with a burst of energy he pressed ever faster onward. Zig zagging and jumping stumps and short bushes Will ran trying to straighten his run to help Megan.<br />
<br />
Will was just about to where he'd seen her turn left and scream when he heard Megan laughing. this brought Will to a dead stop and a moment to catch his breath. Quickly he felt at ease and then walked around the bend in the trail to see Megan and another man.<br />
<br />
Standing on the pathway was this man and beside him was a reddish pony with a little girl seated on a small saddle. Megan stood there laughing and seeing Will pointed and laughed all the harder.<br />
<br />
Feeling very healthy but ever so foolish Will walked toward the threesome.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked William.<br />
<br />
Megan stopped laughing, she expected her love to red faced and out of breath for running to her but instead Will was looking quite well. She wrapped her arms around him giving him a friendly hug, as Will looked toward the man, his daughter and the pony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go Daddy, Pony Joe wants to go home, and so do I.&quot; said the little girl seated high on the back of the pony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my dear little one, we shall turn around and head for home!&quot; replied the man to his daughter.<br />
<br />
As Megan hugged Will the man pulled on the ponies' rein and turned the animal toward home. Will had then an excellent view as the pony was standing so long in one spot it had gotten at ease with the place. Doing as some male animals will he was about to mark the spot with some of his own urine. The hardy pony had his pecker out if not hard and long it was soft but stretched out better than a foot long yet.<br />
<br />
Stepping along and following the man's pull of the rein the ponies' flacid cock swayed and swung from side to side with every step. The slapping of it on the ponies strong muscled thighs was enough for Will to think back to the draft horse and begin to long for being endowed maybe in such a way for his own sensual pleasuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know that man?&quot; asked Will his voice almost cracking from emotion.<br />
<br />
Megan laughed, &quot;Yes he's Mister Mason Dixson a customer of mine. He owns a pony stud farm and breeds several types of ponies. I think it was neat he happened along, heck I almost ran them over!&quot; said Megan her voice still sounding mixed with laughter.<br />
<br />
Again hand in hand the two lovers walked up the long path and soon were getting into Will's convertable.<br />
<br />
Hands held together even as Will shifted the car from gear to gear.<br />
<br />
Some time later they arrived back at Megan's apartment. Like two kids running upstairs to play games the two made enough noise to wake old lady Stanton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet down out there, can't an old lady get her piece and rest!&quot; yelled the ninty year old tenant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let her rest indeed, but I'll bet she hasn't had any peice of anything in decades!&quot; chuckled Will aloud.<br />
<br />
Megan softly slapped his face and with a smile she opened the door to her apartment.</p>
