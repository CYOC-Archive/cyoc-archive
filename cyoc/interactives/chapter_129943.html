<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessie was still hanging around school, so we couldn&#39;t put our plan into action yet, lest it become known that there were two Jessies in our school. But as we waited, I became aware of a problem with our art teacher, Ms. Angela Cauley.<br />
<br />
Now don&#39;t get me wrong. Ms. Cauley was a fantastic teacher, who showed us all kinds of cool things like painting, framing, and sculpting. But every time she taught a class, there were these assholes who screwed it all up.<br />
<br />
They were Pete, Ted, and Taylor. All of them had reputations as delinquents, and it seemed that they only got worse with time. Whenever, we were trying to learn, they would make noise, throw things around, and generally do whatever they could to make it impossible for poor Ms. Cauley to teach. She had complained about them repeatedly to the school administration, but their only response was indifference and apathy. And Ms. Cauley, for all her strengths as an instructor, was not someone comfortable with standing up for herself. Rumors were already swirling that she would resign her post before the year was out. I refused to let this happen. That poor woman didn&#39;t deserve to lose her job because these three jerks were making her life a living hell. I was going to help her, in the only way I knew how. <br />
<br />
Jeff planted notes in the boys&#39; lockers, supposedly written by Ms. Cauley and asking them to come to her classroom after the school nominally closed for &quot;extra credit&quot;. As hoped, the idiots did exactly that, not once questioning why or how.<br />
<br />
When they entered the room, they found all the tables cleared away, and Ms. Cauley sitting down, completely naked. Let me explain what led to this: after placing the notes, Jeff met with me in the bathroom by the cafeteria. He had Ms. Cauley&#39;s face with him, wrapped in a bundle in his bag. I put it on, and instantly, I became her, with her small face, long brown-blonde hair, and tiny, but fit body. I was ready to teach these pricks a lesson they would never forget.<br />
<br />
As the boys looked around confused, the lights suddenly flashed on in the center of the room, while the rest shut off. It was then that they realized that I, Ms. Cauley, was covered in paint from head to toe, in my hair and my pussy, covering my tongue and the soles of my feet. Raising a finger, I beckoned them to strip and join me for some...pleasure. <br />
<br />
They did, and when they came close, I made it clear that I was only going to pleasure them if they too covered themselves in paint. This they did as well. I licked my green-blue-white stained lips, and their cocks suddenly sprang to life as if by magic.<br />
<br />
They surrounded me, their throbbing cocks begging to be pumped. I got to work right away, sucking on Pete&#39;s while stroking Taylor&#39;s and Ted&#39;s. Taylor lasted only a few minutes before sperm shot out of his penis onto my face. Ted was better: he was closing in on half an hour when he blew his load as well. And Pete, well, he was a trooper. I swore it took nearly two hours before he came, and forced me to swallow his oily, salty-tasting semen.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, I then rose up, and commanded them to lay on the ground, with their stomachs facing up. I then proceeded to put each of their still throbbing cocks into my vagina, until they had all cum a second time. Then I blew them again, and they all came a third time.<br />
<br />
By now, they were panting like dogs. Cumming three times is a lot for any man, especially one who isn&#39;t used to sex. Nevertheless, I practically threw myself at their feet, and pleaded with them to cover me with their man juices. And so they all stood up, and masturbated until they ejaculated more cum onto my body. I continued to plead, but at this point, they decided that they were done.<br />
<br />
But I wasn&#39;t. I stood up, and struck Taylor over the head, knocking him out cold. Before the other two could react, I did the same to Ted. And then only Pete was left. He was a fat pig, too cowardly to defend himself, and he went down easily. When the three woke up, they found that I had tied them down and knotted their balls with strips of fabric. I then explained that I was going to milk their cocks until their balls were dry. That is what I did, until the boys were crying and begging me to stop.<br />
<br />
Oh, I was going to stop. Walking over to my desk, I found the pair of sharp shears that had been stewing in a pot of antiseptic for the last hour or so. Walking over to Taylor, I put a gag in his mouth and kneeled down. His balls were still fat and hairy, and his cock was still, somehow erect. Such magnificent equipment didn&#39;t deserve to belong to such a disgusting boy. <br />
<br />
Ted and Pete were screaming when I came over to them, because when they looked in my bucket, they saw what appeared to be Taylor&#39;s perfectly severed penis and testicles. In the coldest, creepiest voice I could muster, I told them that I would take my new prize and turn it into a dildo. And that if they told anyone what happened, or made any disruption in my classroom again, I would make two more. From now on, they would respect me as a teacher and learn from me, was that understood?<br />
<br />
They said yes so sincerely, that I finally let them go. It was then that I turned to Taylor, who was still laying there, perfectly content. Did I do a good job, Jeff asked me. I replied yes, but that this would be the last time we would ever have an orgy. And he could keep his prosthetic junk, since I clearly didn&#39;t have a need for it.<br />
<br />
From then on, Pete and Ted were the best pupils Ms. Angela Cauley ever had. They even got the chance to present their work at the county&#39;s annual Students in Art festival. Ms. Cauley was beaming with pride. She told everyone she could find that she would make sure these two got into the best art college in the country.<br />
<br />
I was at that event, and I too was filled with pride. And I had Jeff and his creations to thank for that.</p>
