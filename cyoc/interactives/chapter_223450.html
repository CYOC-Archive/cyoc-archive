<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night went well, and Lucy felt a lot better about some things as her eyes began to blink open in the morning. Her conscious mind would know it was start of her second day as another species, but her emotions were also happy in many ways. Sure, there was the proverbial dark shadow caused by the fact that some dark wizard, who was the one responsible for her and her family&#39;s transformations into Slug People, but there was also meeting Melody. Melody had hatched as a Slug Woman, but Lucy found her honest and caring, and before she went to bed, she found that there was honest love on Melody&#39;s part, and that had been enough to solidify the feelings of love and attraction that Lucy had been feeling since meeting Melody. It brought the two of them close together and as Lucy fell in love, she found herself quite willing to mate with Melody, which the two of them eagerly engaged in before going to sleep.<br />
<br />
Lucy wanted to talk on that with Melody as her eyes blinked open and seeing the round eyelids on Melody&#39;s eyestalks also blinking and moving slightly, seeing that the other Slug Woman was waking up as well. Instinctively, it brought some cheer to Lucy&#39;s mind and had her mind racing over how to address Melody after the previous night. However, Lucy also awakened to a series of new sensations that went a bit beyond the feelings that went along with sex as a Slug Woman. She felt close to Melody, but she also felt far fuller and that her middle was a lot bigger than it was when she went to sleep. And as tactile as Slug People were, Lucy also found there was a lot more of Melody too, as she felt part of Melody&#39;s middle on top of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Lucy began nervously as she looked down, tilting both eyestalks to do so and finding the large gravid womb that was her own pushing against the large gravid womb that was Melody&#39;s resting just above it, &quot;uh... I... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re pregnant,&quot; Melody said with some degree of happiness clear in her voice and then cuddling her arms against Lucy.<br />
<br />
Lucy liked the feeling of closeness and feeling her breasts compress against Melody&#39;s, but being pregnant in the summer before her senior year in college was not part of Lucy&#39;s plan in life. It especially wasn&#39;t going to be the plan while a dark wizard, Edward Cupple, had some dark plans in the region. The plans that had turned her, her sisters, her mother, and her twin brother into Slug People.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that can&#39;t be,&quot; Lucy said quickly, her voice rising with her heart beating hard in her chest, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to be a mother... and Cupple is still out there... he&#39;s still after my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cupple won&#39;t get our eggs,&quot; Melody told Lucy, &quot;I won&#39;t let it. My dad won&#39;t let it. We&#39;ll protect them all, I assure you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there are all sorts of other things,&quot; Lucy spoke, &quot;I still have college to finish! And then there&#39;s my mom and my siblings... how do I... explain...&quot; Lucy pulled away to then gesture to her swollen womb with her hands, &quot;this to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melody looked down, and her sensory stalks on her upper lip dropped a little bit, and Lucy took that as a recognition that while Whitney Chapman might accept the two of them dating, there might be some stronger judgement at Lucy being pregnant, particularly while having to deal with whatever trouble that Edward Cupple still posed. While Humans could get into trouble like this, it wasn&#39;t something that was looked on favorably and the mother to be still had nine months to give birth to the baby. Slug Women, however, laid their eggs in a matter of hours after impregnation, and the eggs would hatch no later than three months after being laid. It was a very different timetable, and the threat that Cupple posed was real. It had already confined the residents of the colony to the colony while waiting for a way to legally go after Cupple.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Melody apologized, &quot;this... this is my fault. I mean... meeting you... finding you have interest in me... it is like a dream and I wasn&#39;t thinking. I just wanted to... make you feel good and happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was last night,&quot; Lucy managed a weak smile as she looked to Melody and ran her hand along Melody&#39;s chin, &quot;I just didn&#39;t think that THIS would happen... and... I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If need be... I will take the blame,&quot; Melody said softly, &quot;I should have remembered what you and your family were going through... and I should have recognized that jumping into bed... could have led to something like this. I mean... as hermaphrodites, we can sire offspring on our own. Not as many as your brother could sire as a rare Slug Man... but that doesn&#39;t mean we are incapable of that. And I should have been more aware. It&#39;s my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not entirely,&quot; Lucy answered, her hand moving to rest on her womb while she and Melody untangled their tails from each other, &quot;I mean... I&#39;ve had boyfriends in the past...&quot; Lucy then paused to emphasize her chest for a moment, &quot;but most of them were more interested in these than in my personality, and thus things never really lasted all that long. And so... I just put things aside while waiting for the right person... and in an odd way... despite all the odd stuff that started with Megan and Jenny exposing my family... you seemed to...&quot; Lucy blinked and lowered her eye stalks a bit before continuing, &quot;feel like the right person. And I think I jumped at that... and... well... I&#39;m not sure how everyone will respond...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be some surprise, I&#39;m sure of that,&quot; came a male voice making both Lucy and Melody look up and over to see Jeff resting on his tail in the doorway with one eye looking to Lucy and the other to Melody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff...&quot; Lucy said with surprise and nearly fell off the side of the bed, only to have Melody catch her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought you&#39;d be more... aware of things, Lucy,&quot; Jeff said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things just sort of happened,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;and besides, we weren&#39;t able to get my birth control pills before we left the house yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, &quot;I know... and you may expect a &quot;you should have been smarter&quot; lecture from mom... particularly with all the stuff with Cupple still hanging over us and needing to get help. Giving birth to kids now isn&#39;t good timing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, we&#39;ll lay eggs,&quot; Melody corrected, &quot;and given our present state... Lucy and I will need to begin forming a nest for them to be laid in... and... well... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make sure that my nephews and nieces won&#39;t get used by Cupple as some kind of battery, right?&quot; Jeff asked to Melody, turning both sets of eyes to Melody.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d be nieces,&quot; Melody spoke, &quot;while Slug Women are hermaphrodites, we all still have the XYX chromosome arrangement from Slug Women, while Slug Men have the XYY chromosome arrangement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d still make sure that Cupple wouldn&#39;t get his hands on them?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Melody spoke, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t let some dark wizard abuse MY children any more than you would allow him to abuse your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then with that... welcome to the family,&quot; Jeff said to Melody and with his face softening a bit, &quot;though, this may still mean that there are things to do... and will be complicated by Cupple&#39;s continued presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the moment, Lucy and I will need to construct nests for our eggs,&quot; Melody spoke, &quot;and I can call my dad to see about moving the meeting with the man that can help you with ideas in dealing with Cupple from his home to here... just so Lucy and I can lay and stay close to the eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And work on some explanation that won&#39;t get us in trouble with mom... or the others,&quot; Lucy added, &quot;though... for the moment... breakfast sounds more intriguing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... breakfast first,&quot; Melody agreed.</p>
