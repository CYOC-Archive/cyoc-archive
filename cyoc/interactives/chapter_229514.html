<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The evening of February 16 was a big one, as the Year of the Dragon tournament came down to its final night. And despite all the different Dinotopians and even a few Animalians that were of extant species, the competition had been fairly tight. There wasn&#39;t a lot of points difference between many of the contestants. In fact, depending on how the race finished, it was theoretically possible for someone in the 10th position to climb all the way up to 1st in the male or female categories. Ther herm category was even closer, mostly because of the fact that there were fewer herm Dinotopians competing than those that had one gender. All of this had everyone focused on getting ready for that last race. Though, to Sophie, some of the preparations seemed a bit off.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Kumiyo stated, as she pulled down a second sports bra that she&#39;d squeezed her light grey scaled breasts into and feeling grateful that Tyson had been very helpful in assuring that she&#39;d been thoroughly milked before this competition, &quot;no one should get an unwanted look now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Sophie found herself blurting as she and Roland pulled up their shorts and looked up the female Tylosaurus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
Since they didn&#39;t have direct memberships with the Dino Dome, they didn&#39;t have any lockers that they could save and had to take what lockers were available. At times this moved them around when preparing for these events. Tonight, that luck had them near where Kumiyo, Nellie, Nessa, Tyson, Miki, and Molly. There were a few others that were there as well, though that also soon drew attention to both Kumiyo&#39;s comment and Sophie&#39;s surprised response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember what happened last year, when that one rabbit bounced out of her bra in the first race they did?&quot; Kumiyo said as she then reached for the shirt that she would wear over the two sports bras she put on, &quot;This last race could well decide things and could be complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our legs are built a bit better to swim than run,&quot; Nessa nodded her head, &quot;and in this, we&#39;re probably not going to outrun Heather, Tyra, or even Regina...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or Mr. M,&quot; Tyson added.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can jump, and the maps they&#39;ve put out for the Zodiac Mountain for the Year of the Dragon do include steps that could allow us to go straight up the mountain in a shorter line than those running along the foot path,&quot; Kumiyo finished, &quot;more energy intensive... but a shorter route, and where we can make up time. But I don&#39;t want to bounce out for all to see, like that rabbit did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica told me that what happened with Shyra was more on the quality of the sports bra she wore more than anything else,&quot; Sophie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same,&quot; Kumiyo answered, &quot;I&#39;m not taking that chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Everyone did get ready, and they made their way out from the locker rooms and into the hallway that led into the main arena. The entryways still felt a bit oversized, even by Dinotopian standards, to Sophie, like a lot of it was set up for things that would relate to the Dino Fight Club matches. But as everyone came out, that effect had some positive reverberations that shook through Sophie&#39;s chest. She could see Jeremy at one seat with Anna-Poly in his lap and shouting &quot;go Mommy!&quot; Sophie also looked around to see that the ticket placements had finally put her parents and Roland&#39;s parents together on the upper south side of the arena&#39;s seats. She elbowed Roland and pointed to where they were. Roland smiled and nodded and then pointed at other points across the arena&#39;s stands where there were signs and flags that had their names written on them being waived as well.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that dominated things was the massive mountain that had been assembled for Zodiac Mountain and to fit the Year of the Dragon contest. Both Sophie and Roland could see the various sections where it was clear that the mountain itself was built and assembled in sections, likely with more metal in the frame then wood, likely to deal with the heavier weight that many of the larger Dinotopians would be bringing than what was compared to the other Animalians. Where was also a strong sent of rubber and other sorts of padding that would also serve to help cushion the feet of those competing. The big thing was that there was a plastic retaining wall that went around much of the arena&#39;s floor and came up to Sophie&#39;s shoulders. That retaining wall held back a practical sea of foam blocks that surrounded the Zodiac Mountain.<br />
<br />
They then made their way to the rows of seats on the south side of the arena that were set for the contestants, that was then when JC and Pauline&#39;s voices were able to come over the speakers and the big screens allowed for a view of where they were. It was something that allowed for Sophie to see where they were presently set up on the north side of the arena. The big screen also gave everyone the ability to look to JC and Pauline, as the massive constructed mountain that had been made for anyone to see directly across the arena in a north to south or east to west direction. The mountain, which on the whole looked like a flat-topped volcano from a children&#39;s book on the Mesozoic Era, was in the way. There were actually multiple sets of stairs that went up the sides of the mountains, though one would obviously have to jump to go from step to step. Though, JC and Pauline&#39;s introduction on the big screen also showed on who was with them.<br />
<br />
The new Animalia Ambassadoria cast obviously wasn&#39;t with them, as while it was a Friday, they were all in Lyre/Animalia and really wouldn&#39;t have had time for the trip from Lyre/Animalia to Dallas and then to Dino City. However, the Lunar New Year had often had the previous year&#39;s winners offer the crown that they won to the winners of the new year. The Year of the Dragon had some things set up where they actually had herm Dinotopians that were competing and that then set up for a third crown to cover the herm Dinotopians, and that sat on the table in front of JC and Pauline with the men&#39;s and woman&#39;s crowns. The bigger thing was who was present and seated beside JC and Pauline... Mr. Shikamatsu and his daughter, Michiko, who had been the winners of the Year of the Rabbit Contest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay every, THIS is what everyone has been waiting for, the race up Zodiac Mountain,&quot; JC announced, &quot;where we&#39;ll get tot he final point totals to see who wins the Year of the Dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have a very narrow race, even before the Fire Breathing Curry Contest,&quot; Pauline nodded, &quot;with those held yesterday... we have some very tight races. Among the males, we have Rex in the lead, followed by Roland and Mr. M... which really shows on how narrow some of the point differences have been. On the female side, Heather retains her lead, but Tyra has climbed all the way from fourth to second and pushing Regina down to a tie for third with Sophie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the scores are close,&quot; JC agreed, &quot;but the contest is closest among the herms... In previous years, many of the herm Animalians have either chosen not to participate or that we didn&#39;t have herm Animalians for that representative of the Lunar New Year. This year, however, we do have a few candidates... though, the top two among the herm Dinotopians have also had the most experience at being herm Dinotopians... with Harper in first and Dakota right behind hir.  But after hir... we then have, in order, Devine, Duffy, and then Devorah. So, it&#39;s a very narrow race here among the herms with only a limited number in that specific group. Devorah may presently be in last place, but things are so close that shi could win it all if shi wins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, while the herm Dinotopians go to the starting line,&quot; Pauline nodded to JC, &quot;why don&#39;t we go over the course, so they all know what they&#39;ll be running up...&quot;<br />
<br />
JC nodded again, &quot;on the whole, Zodiac Mountain resembles a child&#39;s view of what a typical Mesozoic volcano looks like... and well, maybe ANY volcano, given that many would think that they always have an open and flat top. But unlike the Zodiac Mountains used in Lyre/Animalia, the one for Dino City is MUCH larger and strengthened so that it also provides strength and stability to deal with the muscle weight for the larger Dinotopians... and then bone weight if we include the Marine reptiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bone weight?&quot; Pauline asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that all true Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs largely had hollow bones,&quot; JC explained, &quot;much of this was a measure to allow for large size among many Dinosaurs, as the bones would be proportionately strong and lightweight. In time, it also proved beneficial for flight, first with Pterosaurs and with all living extant &quot;Dinosaurs,&quot; aka Birds. Thus, because their bones are hollow, their bones are proportionately lighter than those of pretty much all other vertebrates, including Marine Reptiles of the Mesozoic Era... including the Mosasaurs, which are thought to be relatively closely related to modern Monitor Lizards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... all of this then explains the size of this Zodiac Mountain in comparison to the main one used in Lyre/Animalia,&quot; Pauline spoke, &quot;but there are certain features that would be added to this one... and the overall course from the other ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of this has to do with the diverse grouping of animals that could qualify as a &quot;dragon&quot; for this contest,&quot; JC continued, &quot;and that may include multiple different strengths and limitations. For example, large Sauropods may be the strongest land animals ever, but their own size would also limit their speed. And to a degree, there is some estimation that the super large Theropods may not have been the speediest animals either... Faster than what they hunted and excellent land animals, but not zipping about a pace to keep up with a speeding car as seen in Jurassic Park. Now, the Dinotopians may be far faster than animals they&#39;re based on, likely a component of the &quot;Human-factor&quot; in every Animalian, but they will all still have certain... shall we say &quot;limitations,&quot; and the designers for Zodiac Mountain had to give in options to allow all a way to compete in this race.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This means there are ultimately multiple ways to get to the top of Zodiac Mountain and press the buzzer that is on a table at the top,&quot; Pauline picked up the introduction, &quot;the most obvious way would be to run up the path that spirals up the side of the mountain and those that are fast runners may take that route. There are also set &quot;steps&quot; that go straight up the sides of the mountain, and actually cover LESS distance than the path. One will have to jump to get to the top. But because the route is shorter, they may be able to get to the top before those running.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while this won&#39;t affect the herm Dinotopians in the contest,&quot; JC began the final portion, &quot;there are also options for all flying Dinotopians who wish to use their wings and any advantages that come from flight to use as well. If one will look to the ceiling, we have set flags with the outline of a Pterosaur on them. From the starting line, any flying Dinotopian that wishes to rely on their wings must fly to that point and then make a rapid turn to head back to the top of Zodiac Mountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline nodded, &quot;and not that this is also a set flight path. One cannot just zoom at high speed and then bank over the crowd. As we don&#39;t want anyone to fall onto someone in the crowd. Thus, once one touches the marked flag, they must bank backyard in a sharp line toward the table. And we do have judges that will be keeping an eye on that route. Any deviation from that assigned path will be reported and points deducted. This route is also longer than the spiraling route around the mountain but given that the Pterosaurs can gain greater speeds by flying... that negates the longer distance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, much has also been done for safety,&quot; JC finished, &quot;we have lots of big foam blocks on the floor to soften any crashes, and much of the outer coating of Zodiac Mountain is soft and bouncy enough that should anyone jump over a step... or there is a collision on the path up, there shouldn&#39;t be any serious injuries. But we would still advise people pay attention and be careful. As if someone Human sized runs into a Sauropod at full speed... the Sauropod Dinotopian may not feel the full impact of the collision by as much as the Human sized Dinotopian would. So... be sure to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie glanced to Roland as she looked to where the flag with the Pterosaur icon was on the roof. It looked like the flag was fastened to one of the folding basketball hoops that were set up for Dinotopians to use as well. It all made for some interesting options as Sophie then looked to the starting line where the two Dakotaraptor Dinotopians, Dakota and Harper were taking up their positions and stretching while the Brontosaurus, Devine, the Triceratops, Duffy, and the Tyrannosaurus, Devorah were all preparing for the starting &quot;bell.&quot; The starting &quot;bell&quot; proved to be a gong and that sent the group running. Dakota and Harper quickly took the lead, and Sophie noted that both Dakotaraptor Dinotopians actually held their arms out in an almost spread fashion as they circled up the ramp. Duffy and Devorah were close behind them as they ran, though the two of them were fairly close together. The only one who took a different route was Devine, who turned to hop up the various steps that went up the side of the mountain. Sophie watched as the herm Brontosaurus went up the stairs in a diagonal motion and going up from level to level.<br />
<br />
Dakota passed the point where Devine would reach the &quot;second&quot; level of the mountain, but Harper was only just arriving as Devine reached that level. The result of this slowed Harper and Devorah who was starting to pull ahead of Duffy. This then continued as Devine made her jumps up and the rest then continued up the path after Devine had passed through. Sophie continued to watch as Dakota made hir way up onto the top level and with Harper actually beginning to catch up. However, at about the same time, Devine made it onto the top level and in a moment of &quot;desperation&quot; lowered hir head and hit the buzzer with hir nose just before Harper could hit the buzzer with hir hand. Devorah and then Duffy followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there we have the results for the herm Dinotopians in the final race, with Dakota winning,&quot; JC spoke, &quot;Devine managed to leap up into second, Harper came in third, while Devorah finished fourth, and Duffy finished fifth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that Devine took second by a nose,&quot; Pauline gave a quip and then continued, &quot;because of the limited number of herm Dinotopians... the first-place prize would take the crown for herm Dinotopians, so congratulations, Dakota. You will be awarded the crown for the herm Dinotopians... and Horizon will be more than happy to cover expenses for a two-week vacation to a destination of your choice for you and a &quot;plus one.&quot; Congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few claps that were there as Mr. Shikamatsu and Michiko were shown in the big screen rising up and then carrying the third crown, which some painted decals that looked like flower petals in both bright pink and blue colors on it to present Dakota. Sophie was fairly pleased that they&#39;d managed to expand things to an added award, mostly because of how bent out of shape some people got over issues of gender. Many of the issues that related to that struck Sophie as something that wasn&#39;t going to be limited to just biology or genetics, and just repeating genetic or biological facts wasn&#39;t going to solve the problem. Personally, Sophie felt those that were trans should have the right to identify with how THEY felt most comfortable, but some politicians were bound and determined to make all sorts of laws that went after those groups, and these were often things that made the herm option attractive to some people when they became Animalians, as it would give them some feeling of completeness, or at least bring them closer to how they felt. In this, Dakota&#39;s win and crown would be a total middle finger to all those haters that wanted to legislate on these things, and hopefully, in the coming years, more herm Animalians would compete... maybe build enough measure of comfort in the people at large that the herms could then integrate with the genders they identified as.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be up next as the males have their race,&quot; Sophie said to Roland.<br />
<br />
Roland nodded as he watched the scene on the big screen where Devine gave Dakota a congratulatory pat on the back, which nearly sent Dakota sliding off the top of the mountain. Thankfully the Dakotaraptor caught hirself in time.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took a little while to get things ready for the males to run their race. And here, Sophie sat calmly and kept her eyes on Roland, who had kept himself in the running for the male&#39;s tournament. Much of it had been from Roland doing quite well in the Fire Breathing Curry contest. Sophie didn&#39;t know that Roland could tolerate things there as well as he did. Sophie had done okay, there, but had largely gone with a fairly mild flavor and even then, didn&#39;t last super long when compared to some of the others. Roland didn&#39;t go the super spicy route, but he did go a fair bit spicier than what Sophie did... and among the males, the only one who lasted longer was Rex. When they asked on the how or why, Rex had ultimately mentioned that a lot of Hispanic cooking could be pretty spicy and contributed a lot to the various Mexican Restaurants in the US. Curry may have been more of a Southeast Asian food, but to Rex, it appeared that &quot;spice was spice&quot; and it wasn&#39;t too different from Heather growing up on her grandmother&#39;s spicy gumbo.<br />
<br />
That left things fairly close, and Sophie was happy to root as hard as she could for Roland. The biggest issue was more that her voice got drowned out by many of the other voices that were out there. Some cheered for Roland, but there were many other names that Sophie could hear being cheered as the males took their spots and began to line up. Roland took up his spot with Buzz and Fred Timm to get ready for the start. Though, there also seemed to be some other minor issues that Sophie noticed as Rex and Mr. M soon moved two male Ankylosaurus Dinotopians apart. Walter was moved toward the front and actually blocked Sophie&#39;s view of Roland and the other, Robert was moved away to the other side of the starting line. <br />
<br />
From what gossip Sophie had heard from Heather, was that as Robert Randyson began developing more of his &quot;bi&quot; side as a Dinotopian, he occasionally had questions on how to act on that, as he didn&#39;t want to cheat on his husband, Gus Numan. Sophie noted the Utahraptor Dinotopian moving to comfort Robert... However, as Spring wasn&#39;t too far away and the time when many Bird, Reptile, and Amphibian Animalians, along with all Dinotopians had their mating season, it was triggering some kind of hormonal rivalry between Walter and Robert, even though Walter was married to Dory, a Cenozoic Mammal Animalian that had its own set of armor, and Robert was married to Gus. Thankfully, Rex and Mr. M seemed to be able to get them to move apart before they bashed each other&#39;s hips in with their tail clubs.<br />
<br />
As things settled down, Sophie then waited calmly for the gong that would start the male&#39;s race. And as it did, some things were fairly obvious. Roland and Buzz were quick to take off while Luke and Andrew moved to go up the staggered steps up the side of the mountain. Though, it was ultimately Tyson who beat them to the first step. Those running ran well, but there were some obvious leaders. Mr. M with all his training quickly took the lead among those running with Rex a bit behind him, though, he was also having to use some of his bulk to try and block Gus from passing him as the Utahraptor Dinotopian made good progress, and with this being a pure race, and carrying weights wasn&#39;t there to wear anyone down, Gus actually held a natural advantage. For Utahraptor was a large Dromaeosaur, but it wasn&#39;t so weighed down that it couldn&#39;t run. Though, most of Sophie&#39;s attention wasn&#39;t on this group. Sophie was focused more on Roland&#39;s race with Buzz.<br />
<br />
Sophie had to admit that Buzz had improved a lot as a flyer and was actually able to fly quite well now, and to a degree, that gave Sophie some sense of pride in that she and Roland had done a good job at teaching him how to fly. It seemed like something that Buzz might end up being able to take a lot of that into play and being the Dinotopian flight instructor the way some of the Bird Animalians in Lyre/Animalia ran the flight schools that taught those wanting to become Bird Animalians on how to fly. But pride was not something that Sophie was going to let get in the way of who she was rooting for. Buzz had greatly grown as a flyer, but much like in the Dragons of the Air contest, his larger size actually hurt him a bit when it came to the contests of speed. Buzz had to slow down a lot more and a lot sooner in order to make the required turns, and Roland didn&#39;t. This actually gave Roland the open lead for the final leg of the contest, and that had Sophie bouncing up and down in her seat with excitement.<br />
<br />
Particularly as the race on the mountain had progressed with some surprises. Mr. M and Rex were actually placed well to hold the lead and make it a tight race between them, but Tyson had made good time to make his jumps up the steps that went up the side of the mountain. He was at a pace where, if he didn&#39;t tire, he might actually upset both Mr. M and Rex. And after Roland touched the flag for the turn back toward the top of the mountain, Sophie looked down to see that Tyson had leaped up onto the second level but had done so with enough energy that his webbed feet slipped a bit as he landed and that lead to an awkward landing. This slowed him down, and Sophie could see some rather heavy breathing on Tyson&#39;s part, which was likely to slow him down on the second level to the top. The awkward landing, however, also slowed down those running up the path as they had to wait for Tyson to regain his balance and either jump again or try to run. This slowed both Mr. M and Rex down to where once the path was cleared, that gave Gus the room to get by both of them.<br />
<br />
That then set up the final ending on the race as Roland buzzed the top and hit the buzzer as he passed over it before managing a safe landing on one end of the top of Mount Zodiac that would be away from where the respective steps were and where the path came up onto the top. The big screen then flashed the names as the finished... 1. Roland Luwrie (Pterodactylus Antiquus), 2. Buzz Rainfield (Pteranodon Longiceps), 3. Gus Numan (Utahraptor Ostrommaysi)... Sophie lost track on where the others finished. She was too busy screaming, &quot;yay&quot; as loudly as she could manage. And as the last of the males managed to reach the top and touch the buzzer, the final standings were put up on the screen. And that was where JC and Pauline&#39;s voices were picked up over the speakers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there we have an incredibly tight race... and one where we can see the effects of a larger field,&quot; JC spoke, &quot;the real race for first seemed to be set between Mr. M and Rex to see if they could beat Roland or Buzz and their speed in the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And up until a tiring Tyson landed in front of them on the second level, it looked like one or both might manage it,&quot; Pauline added, &quot;but that sudden stop and go gave Gus the window of opportunity to make the pass and put a raptor&#39;s speed to good use. So, we&#39;ll now see what the calculations on Mr. M falling to fourth in this race and Rex falling to fifth does to the overall standings...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie watched as the overall standings then came up on the big screens and then showed a flip. Roland jumped up from second to first while Rex&#39;s and Mr. M&#39;s lead over the rest had been enough that neither Buzz nor Gus was able to pass them in the overall standings. The screen then put up the top three for the males overall... 1. Roland Luwrie (Pterodactylus Antiquus), 2. Dr. Rex Ramos (Tyrannosaurus Rex), 3. &quot;Mr.&quot; M (Carcharodontosaurus Saharicus).<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would appear like that would give first place and the crown to Roland,&quot; JC spoke, &quot;congratulations on a well-run race. And as with Dakota, Horizon would be glad to give you, Roland, a week&#39;s vacation to any place you may want to go... and this will also be at any time of the year. So, you can finish the school year.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took a little time to then sort things out and get things ready for the start of the female&#39;s race. There was the option for Roland to be crowned, as Dakota had been after the herm Dinotopians went, but then, that grouping had also been smaller and relatively special. The males&#39; race had been pretty big, and, in many ways, there hadn&#39;t been a lot of difference between individuals, and showed on how close things were. This gave Sophie some sense that they would crown the males and females together, and as she made her way with the females to take up spots at the starting line, she was only able a brief pat on Roland&#39;s shoulder as they passed and as the males made their way back to the area where the all the contestants had been lead to before the races up Zodiac Mountain began. As they reached the starting line, Sophie noted on Horizon employee who had made the trip approach Roland and gave a point across the arena toward the main area where JC and Pauline were seated with their desk. That employee collected Dakota as well, which also created the idea that once the female&#39;s champion was crowned the whole group would get a picture together as well.<br />
<br />
That only kept Sophie focused on her stretches for the female&#39;s race. Most of it was to stretch her wings and give some small practice flaps, for she knew that flight was her only real option to win. As a Pterosaur Dinotopian, she didn&#39;t have the longer legs that many of the other Dinotopians had, and her feet were also largely plantigrade. It was really only two flying Dinotopians that might be able to run with the other Dinotopians. Quetzal who might be able to with her greater height allowing for longer legs and thus a longer stride. Arcelia as an Archaeopteryx Dinotopian had the longer digitigrade feet that could help her run or even jump up the steps if need be. Sophie figured that Arcelia might take those stairs, as while she was smart, she didn&#39;t have much strength in terms of powered flight, and thus trying to get to the flag would be difficult in a timely manner, but they could help her go up from step to step.<br />
<br />
The real race was really going to be on how well Sophie could fly against the best runners among the other females. Heather and Tyra had been pretty dominant in the Dragons of the Earth contest while Stacy and Regina had been able to hold their own. However, the fastest to running Dinotopians were likely Sora and Yuki Yurikazi, as the two Velociraptors were small and nimble and essentially built more for speed while many of the larger Theropods often had more muscle attachments for strength to either wrestle with large prey or support their own weight. And that could affect Heather, Tyra, Stacy, and Regina... and Regina especially because her legs seemed slightly shorter than other large Theropods that were there. Of course, there would be some potential tipping points as Racheal Stega had a lot of experience and training that related to the Dino Fight Club, and likely had some endurance, as would Courtney Domini. <br />
<br />
Then, of course, there was the largest wild card of them all, the stairs up the side of the mountain. Sophie was pretty sure that Jen, Marjorie, and Kumiyo would be using that route, as it would be shorter and easier for them to hop up the steps then to try and run after the other Dinotopians. And both Devine and Tyson had proved that that route could provide for a chance to win. While Sophie wasn&#39;t super sure on the exact shape that Jen and Kumiyo were in, she remembered some of the bits that made it into Animalia Ambassadoria after Marjorie&#39;s conversion, with the newly converted Diplodocus Dinotopian taking a mobility scooter that looked like it was built to hold someone who weighed over three hundred pounds, perhaps more, and then tossing that scooter like it was a basketball into the main dumpster behind Horizon. And the distance looked fairly impressive from what Sophie could remember. As such, Marjorie had to be in pretty good shape, and that meant that Sophie would be in for a tough race, even with her flight advantage.<br />
<br />
From there, Sophie moved to the starting line, and noted Norrie and Hazel lining up beside her. Like her, the two of them crouched down and moved their wings forward into a prepared launch position. Only Quetzal kept her wings back and stood up in a runner&#39;s stance on the other side of Hazel.<br />
<br />
&quot;May the best flyer win,&quot; Norrie said to Sophie with a wink, &quot;and by that, I mean the first flyer out of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us are insect Animalians, and insects were the first animals to truly fly,&quot; Sophie pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean, young one,&quot; Norrie teased and then the gong went off signally the start of the race.<br />
<br />
From there Sophie was quick to launch herself into the air and raising up toward the flag with the Pterosaur icon. Out of the corner of one eye, Sophie could see that she had a relatively narrow lead building over Norrie, though Hazel wasn&#39;t too far behind both of them. However, things there then shifted as Sophie touched the flag and banked back to make the turn to head for the top of Zodiac Mountain and the buzzer. Norrie dove a little bit to avoid a midair collision, and Sophie also rolled a little bit in the air to aide in that. To most in the audience, it probably looked like Sophie and Norrie had been practicing the maneuver. Hazel fell behind a bit more as while she had a good forward speed, the turn in this race was a sharp one and that became something that she couldn&#39;t maintain as well as Sophie and Norrie could.<br />
<br />
As she turned back toward the mountain, Sophie got a good look to see on how some of the race for the runners was going. Quetzal was indeed running and was actually making good time and was keeping up with Rachael. There was a bit of a crowded front with Tyra and Heather managing to hold the front two spots with Sora and Yuki close behind with Stacy and Courtney close behind them. However, as they approached the second level, this was where those leaping up the stairs came into the picture again. Arcelia actually took the lead has she hopped up for the last step on the lower level with Marjorie right behind her. Heather and Tyra had to skid to a near halt as Arcelia ran across with Marjorie coming close behind. And from the look of things to Sophie, Kumiyo and Jen weren&#39;t that far behind Marjorie, and the Diplodocus Dinotopian&#39;s size was enough that Heather and Tyra didn&#39;t want to risk a collision. However, to Sophie&#39;s great surprise, Sora and Yuki kept right on forward, slid down like they were sliding into second base on a double and going under Marjorie as Marjorie leaped for the next step going up and got up and resumed running again. It left Heather and Tyra both staring with some surprised blinks.<br />
<br />
Sophie kept going as she saw Heather and Tyra both recover from the surprise, and they even passed Courtney again as they got going again. This then set about the finish and Sophie flew hard, though she had underestimated Arcelia&#39;s speed and Sophie ended up finishing second in the race after Arcelia. As she landed, she looked up to the big screen to keep track of where the others finished in the female&#39;s race. It read: 1. Arcelia (Archaeopteryx Lithographica), 2. Sophie Albers (Pterodactylus Antiquus), 3. Yuki Yurikazi (Velociraptor Mongoliensis), 4. Sora Yurikazi (Velociraptor Mongoliensis), 5. Norrie Simus (Ornithocheirus Simus), 6. Heather Green (Syntixisaurus Rex), 7. Tyra Ramos (Syntixisaurus Rex)... Sophie let herself breathe a little bit, as she didn&#39;t win the race, but she had enough of a lead over Arcelia that the Archaeopteryx Dinotopian wouldn&#39;t pass her. The real question was on where the points gained from the race would then translate into the overall standings.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well,&quot; came Heather&#39;s voice, making Sophie turn and look up, catching Heather&#39;s head presently blocking one of the Dino Dome&#39;s ceiling lights.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not jealous?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little... but honestly, the real surprise was at seeing Sora and Yuki essentially slide under Marjorie as she jumped up the stairs,&quot; Heather answered with a shrug, &quot;that actually had me impressed and I can&#39;t really complain... it may mean that you&#39;ll win the female&#39;s competition... but you did well, and it&#39;s not your fault two raptors pulled off something that completely stunned me. Besides, your mate already won the male&#39;s portion. So... now you two will get to go together... it may make who your &quot;plus ones&quot; will be... but... that is what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d actually thought on letting Jessica and Roger come along,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;it&#39;d be our summer adventure... though we hadn&#39;t figured out on where to go, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
And it was at this time that Sophie then heard JC and Pauline&#39;s commentary on the female&#39;s race.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that finishes another tight race, with its own surprises,&quot; Pauline commented, &quot;but that now leaves the question how does these results effect the overall standings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the calculations are coming in,&quot; JC answered, &quot;and they should be coming up onto the big screen now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie again read it as it came out... 1. Sophie Albers (Pterodactylus Antiquus), 2. Heather Green (Syntixisaurus Rex), 3. Yuki Yurikazi (Velociraptor Mongoliensis). Sophie couldn&#39;t help but smile at all of that.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The main crowning even for Sophie and Roland did come after the female&#39;s race ended and there was still a packed arena. And again, Sophie could see on the big screen as Mr. Shikamatsu and Michiko carried out their responsibilities for their win in the Year of the Rabbit contest the previous year. The crown wasn&#39;t exactly a perfect fit, and Sophie felt the front part of it was nestled against her crest, but she felt happy that Roland won and that she would be able share this with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, Mr. Year of the Dragon,&quot; Sophie said to Roland.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the same to you, Ms. Year of the Dragon,&quot; Roland said back, &quot;and also to you, Dakota... the Hir of the Year of the Dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;though... I&#39;m hoping that in future that things like this may help more people may accept herms... along with all the others that some people just seem to look down on. I mean... I won&#39;t complain about being a herm, and... well... I wouldn&#39;t go back to being mono-gendered if I could. But I do remember being a female Osprey before being uplifted. And there are times where I would prefer to feel that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d both agree with you on that,&quot; Sophie spoke, &quot;and you did look quite good in the pageant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dakota responded as the three smiled for the picture that covered the winners of the Year of the Dragon contest.<br />
<br />
The photos were to go well, and they paid no attention to the announcement from JC that all of the segments from the Year of the Dragon, from the opening to the last races and the crowns being given to Sophie, Roland, and Dakota would be shown again on Leap Day.</p>
