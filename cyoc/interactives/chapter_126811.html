<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since he was Deputy Mayor, Robbie didn&#39;t need to make as many public appearances as Clara. Not that he wasn&#39;t doing his fair share in running Animalia. Clara needed as much help as she could get. But while Clara&#39;s family was often in the spotlight, Robbie and Martha were able to enjoy a bit more privacy. It was true that Martha was one of the models at the Animalian School of Modeling, but she was one of dozens.<br />
<br />
Their anniversary dinner was a lot quieter than what Clara and Richard&#39;s were. The two of them were simply having a home-cooked meal together. Not that there was anything wrong with that. Martha was a pretty good cook, though a lot of her cooking once served to try and quell her insatiable appetite. But now she was able to cook more nutritious meals to share with her husband. And one of the best things about being foxes was that their diets weren&#39;t a lot different than humans&#39;. There were a few things they couldn&#39;t eat like chocolate, but Martha was fine with that. She had enough chocolate to last a lifetime.<br />
<br />
After a sumptuous dinner, Martha spent some time on the phone talking with her parents, &quot;How&#39;s everything back home? Nothing at all? What are the neighbors up to? Oh come on, you have to have some curiosity. Well, what TV shows have you been watching. Uh-huh, ok, ok, I&#39;ll need to start writing those down. So how soon will you be here? Well, it is Christmastime. Some country air will be good for you. Ok, I love you too. I&#39;ll be seeing you eventually. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I haven&#39;t really seen much of your parents since our wedding,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;There&#39;s not any trouble between you, is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no,&quot; said Martha, &quot;They just can&#39;t really work up the effort to come all this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be that hard,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robert, my parents are the most sedimentary people I know. They never work any longer than they have to. They never even <i>stand</i> as longer than they have to,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what caused your...weight problem?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was more genetic. But I think putting those two together increased my odds,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they&#39;d be more active if they were foxes like us,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
Martha laughed loudly at that. When she got control again, she said &quot;Robbie, I doubt they&#39;d ever become anything as high-strung as foxes. If anything, they&#39;ll probably go with something as slow-moving as them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like turtles?&quot; asked Robbie teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or pandas,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or sloths,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
Martha gave a sudden gasp of epiphany, &quot;Or ground sloths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say what?&quot; asked Robbie in puzzlement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;ve been looking for more people to be part of that Ice Age project,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Project Cenozoic,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think my parents would be perfect for becoming giant ground sloths,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha, you know that ground sloths are a lot different from tree sloths, right?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m pretty sure ground sloths were not super-fast predators,&quot; said Martha, &quot;But I think I&#39;ll ask them when they get here what they think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want,&quot; said Robbie, briefly wondering what it would be like to have ground sloths as in-laws.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is something else that I want,&quot; said Martha, sitting close to Robbie on the couch, &quot;I haven&#39;t been just thinking about my family. I&#39;ve been thinking about <i>our</i> family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie looked at his wife and asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Robbie, last year, I wasn&#39;t ready for having children,&quot; said Martha, &quot;I was wanting to become a model and I was worried I would get fat again. But I&#39;ve seen plenty of my friends have kids of their own and they&#39;ve been able to work off the fat pretty well. And I think I could be a maternity model for a while. It certainly worked for Clara during her pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying you&#39;re ready to have kits now?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not right now,&quot; said Martha, &quot;I won&#39;t be going into heat until spring. But when that comes, I want to have your kits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie hugged her close and said, &quot;You really want to be a mother now? You don&#39;t mind me being the father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the only problem I see is explaining to our kids why you&#39;re not that much older than them,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I were still a normal fox, I&#39;d be fully grown by now,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;Our kits will take longer to reach maturity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;ll be worth it,&quot; said Martha before pulling Robbie&#39;s head to hers. The two of them made out on the couch for quite a while. Eventually, Martha felt something hard pushing against her leg. &quot;You know, just because I&#39;m not in season yet, doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t practice,&quot; she said lustfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is our anniversary,&quot; said Robbie before they headed to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
An interesting fact about red foxes was that while their mating season was not until spring, their reproductive organs made preparations for it during the months before that. For vixens, their ovaries became up to twice as big as usual. For tods, their testicles start building up more sperm, reaching their greatest weight during the winter. Strictly speaking, it didn&#39;t effect Robbie and Martha&#39;s sex that night since Martha was not receptive to conception yet. But that didn&#39;t stop them from enjoying themselves.<br />
<br />
Martha gave small yips and bark as Robbie thrust into her. They went up a few octaves as Robbie suckled from one of her breasts. In the back of his mind, Robbie reflected how suckling from Clara&#39;s breast was how he became double-dosed in the first place. Until they met their respective mates, Robbie and Clara had plenty of sex, mostly to take the edge off of the stress that leadership caused. But sex with Martha felt more compatible to Robbie, as if she were designed to please him more. He also found her milk a lot tastier than Clara&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Martha dug her claws into Robbie&#39;s shoulder as she felt herself reaching her peak. She never realized how incomplete her life was before Robbie. She was miserable being so fat, but she didn&#39;t know just lonely she was. Well, she did feel lonely, but she hadn&#39;t really known the emptiness it made inside her. Now Robbie had filled that emptiness more than she would have imagined. And speaking of which, she could sense that Robbie was reaching his peak too. She humped harder against Robbie, her pussy&#39;s lips bouncing off of the knot of his cock until she was able to force them around it. It was at this point that Martha let out a cry as she felt herself convulse. Robbie let out a deep grunt as he finally let loose his payload, his knot swelling up to keep them locked in place.<br />
<br />
Once the two foxes had calmed down a bit, Martha kissed Robbie and said, &quot;Happy anniversary. I hope this is good enough practice for spring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this will be nothing compared to spring,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;When the heat ignites in you, you&#39;ll be driven to satisfy it as much as you can. We&#39;ll be spend several days mating until you&#39;re finally impregnated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...I can hardly wait,&quot; purred Martha, resting her head against her husband&#39;s chest.</p>
