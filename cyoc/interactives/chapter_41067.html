<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daryn did see that rather thankfully that he was still in the library and not on some <br />
strange alien parallel world where bizarre creatures were normal... maybe... with hope! <br />
Then again at least then he wouldn't be vivisected! The idea was enough to spur Daryn to <br />
run towards the book. Which caused him to fall over when he remembered he didn't have <br />
legs. He then slowly but surely -slithered- towards the table, and saw, miracle of miracles <br />
(or maybe doom of doom) that the book was still there, and still on the page it had been <br />
on that had gotten Daryn into this mess! <br />
<br />
Even though Daryn knew he couldn't read the book he was hoping beyond hope for <br />
something -anything- that could get him back to normal! He hesitated to touch or even <br />
look at the book but he had no other options. <br />
<br />
-The Lamia- Daryn read the title of the picture. 'Wait! I just read the title?! Huh? But-<br />
but.... but I can! The letters haven't changed! But I can now read all of them!... Have I <br />
forgotten how to read english-?!' Daryn took a quick look around and saw that no, he <br />
could still read the titles of all the other book in the library. 'Speaking of which, why has <br />
no one run into this book before? Or get zapped like me? Or did they get zapped on a <br />
picture of humans and changed the world-?!' Thankfully a nearby poster of Martin Luther <br />
King Jr. disproved this theory. 'I... don't know if this is a good or a bad thing.' <br />
<br />
Sigh, and hesitantly all the same, Daryn read. <br />
<br />
-This book has been of extremely old age, resulting in no one really want to touch and <br />
thus smudge the pages. Also, this book was bought via a whole sale from another library <br />
that was closed down to shift funds to homeless shelters, and was barely looked at when <br />
it was shelved into the index of this public school.-<br />
<br />
 &quot;Huh?&quot; 'Did this book just answer his question about why no one got zapped before him?' <br />
<br />
Daryn read further, -Yes, this book has just altered it's text to answer your perfectly <br />
logical question on why no one in recent memory has been altered by this book's power.-<br />
<br />
Daryn shook his head, feeling a mental chill rather than a physical one feeling the long <br />
waving hair.  &quot;Okay, then tell me how to get back to normal!&quot; <br />
<br />
-Can't change the hamburger back into the cow. Sorry.- Tears wield up in Daryn's eyes. -<br />
But you have more important things to worry about, and do.- <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Daryn blinked away the tears. <br />
<br />
- You are now. The Lamia. Originally a queen who was cursed by Hera after the queen's <br />
children were taken away from the queen. The curse transformed her into a snake like <br />
being, but the real curse, was that she would HAVE to kill and devour any human child she <br />
came across. She was ultimately killed by a paladin during the crusades.-<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-wha-what-?!&quot; 'Why would anyone MAKE such a horrible book-?!'<br />
<br />
-Some mages have very sick senses of humor, or maybe a warped sense of artistic <br />
preservation. This book was not with it's writer long enough to learn. And for the record <br />
this book is not horrible, it simply is!- <br />
<br />
&quot;But, I'm a guy, I'm a human being, my name is Daryn Waves, I'm a high school student.&quot; <br />
<br />
Daryn read gingerly onward. <br />
<br />
-Correction on most of your points. You were male. You were human. You are now The <br />
Lamia, as both your name and identity. The sooner you accept that, the better off you will <br />
be.-<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S BS!&quot; Daryn shouted, and then realized how stupid he looked shouting at a book, <br />
(then again given his appearance), Daryn blinked a couple times then said, &quot;I'm still me. I <br />
still know my name! No matter how much my body's been screwed up by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Again. This book is, what it is. And before you say anything, there is a disclaimer warning <br />
on the book's nature on the back of the cover in very larger letters. You not being able to <br />
read the language before being altered may not have been your fault but neither was it <br />
this book's. And wile you have your own consciousness and memories, your instincts and <br />
brains structure are still yours, but not the 'yours' you had before. -<br />
<br />
Daryn groaned. He didn't once think about how the text seemed to fit without him need to <br />
turn over the page. Then he remembered what the book had said about the curse. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be a monster.&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
-Again. The soon you accept you are female, and not male no matter what you say or tell <br />
yourself the more well adjusted you will ultimately be. But that is not the immediate <br />
concern. This book's curse will enable wherever you go to see your current self as 'normal' <br />
not as a human male named Daryn Waves, but as the creature named The Lamia who goes <br />
to this high-school.  This also means that when you kill and devour your fellow students <br />
instead of being seen as murder it'll be seen as socially acceptable.-<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S INSANE!&quot; <br />
<br />
- That's why it's called a curse. Your choices are to kill yourself or exile yourself as far <br />
away from any human child as possible spending your days all alone until you go mad and <br />
meet the fate of the first Lamia... This book does have a third solution. But you will not <br />
like it in the least... then again... maybe you will... you are a prankster after all.-<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot; Daryn whispered continuing to read.<br />
<br />
- Beware those words but you have said them and can not take them back. This book <br />
contains many, MANY creatures of myth. That are easily many that are not nearly as <br />
accursed as the one you accidently doomed to spend this world's life span as.... You can <br />
now touch this book without fear since you are already changed and one can only be <br />
altered once by this book's power. A form of safety catch created by this book's writer. <br />
With this book in hand or in your possession, you may alter any human human you lay <br />
eyes upon into any creature from this book, as long you have seen that creature's entry in <br />
this book and designate who you wish to change. This book doubts you'd wish to create <br />
another The Lamia, but there is a much VASTER collect than this single entry.... -<br />
<br />
&quot;What good with THAT DO?&quot;<br />
<br />
- You curse, The Lamia, is to devour HUMAN children... children of other creatures is <br />
ignored.-<br />
<br />
&quot;Why won't I just eat them when I see them before I can change them? And if I can resist <br />
the urge why don't I just do THAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
-To be blunt, you can resist going to the bathroom, but not forever. It is the same thing <br />
here. Try to resist for too long, and you will eventually pursue, murder and devour any <br />
human child you have laid eyes on.-<br />
<br />
&quot;You're telling me to erase the human race.&quot;<br />
<br />
-To be fair, by the time you managed THAT with this book's power, humanity will have <br />
finally gotten to the moon and established long term tourist traps upon it. Humans are <br />
just very good at replacing lost numbers.- <br />
<br />
&quot;So my choices are mutate a bunch of innocent kids, live as a hermit, or eat them?&quot;<br />
<br />
- This is the interesting part... I could alter your mind so you think you had always been <br />
The Lamia, with the inconsistencies in your bed room and family members being an oddity <br />
and those odd things people do for no good reason just like everyone else does now when <br />
they'll enter your presence. But I doubt you'd want that... though if you wish to avoid a <br />
global panic I suggest you do so to anyone you change with this book... unless you want <br />
to be burned at the stake or be vivisected.-<br />
<br />
Daryn wanted to scream in frustration. &quot;I really don't have a choice do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
- This book has stated your choices. Do as you will. Think of this to soften the blow at <br />
least as the chance for the ultimate pranks, only with only yourself in on the joke, the <br />
children of this school and people beyond yours to alter to your amusement as you see fit <br />
with only yourself aware of their change of species and often conversion to nudism.... OR <br />
you can mope here until one of your school mates finds you, and you eat them, and are go <br />
on with your life munch, munch, MUNCH!- <br />
<br />
Daryn had to admit, the book did at least make a tempting offer by getting to ka-change <br />
anyone he came across into anything, and if their perception did change, then he'd never <br />
get in trouble. <br />
<br />
-Again, you are the only one who remembers, he, Daryn Waves, all anyone else remember <br />
is she, The Lamia. Now this book suggests you flip through the entries, you don't need to <br />
read every detail, you just need to have SEEN the entry, then this book suggests you <br />
finnish organizing the books you were assigned here for in the first place.-<br />
<br />
The creature of myth in the center of the library sighed, and began to flip through the <br />
entries of the many, many creatures of myth held within. Then began to organize the <br />
library book as it, or rather Daryn Waves had been told to originally.</p>
