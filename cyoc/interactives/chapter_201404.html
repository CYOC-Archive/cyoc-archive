<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After scrambling away from that creepy mirror, Todd found himself in... a stable? Now, this was strange. This was supposed to be an abandoned haunted manor, so why was there a stable with horses still in it? At the very least, being in a stable meant he was close to exiting this creepy manor. Though Todd wasn&#39;t giving that fact much thought, instead, all of his attention was directed toward the horses. <br />
<br />
Being an animal lover, most of his fear and anxiety went away when he saw the horses, but why were they here in the first place? They seemed to have a good amount of food and water. Did the old owners of this manor abandon them when they abandoned this place? How horrible! He heard that people sometimes abandoned their pets when they moved, but he didn&#39;t expect this to happen to horses! Wait, no, that didn&#39;t make any sense. This place has been abandoned for years; there would be no way these horses would have been able to survive without someone to take care of them, right? Well, either way, these horses shouldn&#39;t be stuck in a place like this. Todd approached one of the horses slowly and calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t hurt you, good boy. Once I get out of here, I&#39;ll make sure you get out here, too. You&#39;ll have plenty of space to run around and someone who will take good care of you. That sounds good to you?&quot; Todd then attempted to pet the horse to try to reassure it. The horse allowed the high school senior to pet him and even nuzzled Todd for a bit. The stoner smiled but then suddenly started feeling a bit woozy. Before he could even register what was going on, Todd staggered backward and fell unconscious in a pile of hay. Todd didn&#39;t know how long he was knocked out when he finally woke up, but he knew he felt different. Not himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell just happened?&quot; Todd asked himself, but that was when he noticed that his voice sounded deeper, and his body felt heavier. As Todd got up, he noticed all the horses had mysteriously disappeared. The anxiety and fear he felt before Todd arrived in this room started to come back to him now. There was no way that the horses could have just disappeared into thin air, right? But this was an alleged haunted manor, so really anything was possible. No, Todd told himself, he shouldn&#39;t be worried about something he couldn&#39;t see for now. He needed to check if his body had changed. It was then he noticed that there was a mirror in the corner. Honestly, after the last time, Todd was a bit scared of looking into any mirror in this house, but he had to take a look. When he did, Todd&#39;s jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Crap!&quot; The reflection Todd saw in the mirror no longer looked like a stoner&#39;s reflection. Instead, it looked more like a cowboy&#39;s reflection. His skin was no longer pale but now sunkissed like he had spent countless hours working in the hot sun. His face looked even more rugged and manly than the last time he saw it, but, oddly enough, he didn&#39;t look older like he was expecting him to. A cowboy hat now rested upon Todd&#39;s luscious golden locks. His baggy pants were now replaced with some tight and sturdy jeans, perfect for working on a ranch. Todd&#39;s baggy coat was gone, and its place was a white short-sleeved shirt, unbuttoned to reveal that Todd now had a different body shape.<br />
<br />
Gone was the pasty and thin torso he once had and replacing it was a large pair of muscular pecs and a rippling six-pack. Todd poked and then cupped one of his new pecs. It was rock solid. This wasn&#39;t an illusion. It was reality! Quickly, Todd took off his shirt, revealing the rest of his lean and muscular body. Damn, Todd had to admit he was pretty hot now. The cowboy flexed an arm and watched the muscles ripple. There was no way his arms would get this much definition from just manual labor. Did he play a sport or go to the gym on the side? Todd didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he was secretly ecstatic about these changes. He was now just as muscular as the rest of his friends now.<br />
<br />
Oh, there was one thing that Todd wanted to check. He took a peek inside his pants to confirm that, yup, that was bigger now too. But why did this all happen? Todd&#39;s thoughts drifted to the horses. When he said he would find someone to take care of them, did they want him to do that? No, now wasn&#39;t the time to think about that; he had to get out of here. Todd picked up his shirt, put it on, and tried to button it up, only to realize that there were no buttons on the shirt in the first place. Ugh, whatever, he&#39;ll get a new shirt later. All he had to do now is exit this stable and circle around to the entrance. Hopefully, the others will be there.</p>
