<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the three behemoths entered the gym, all eyes were on them. B had forgot to alter reality, so even though the bodybuilders were <br />
familiar with the gym, the people had never seen the huge men before.<br />
<br />
B, Ced, and Rod were getting settled in, drinking their pre workout shakes when Ced noticed a kid fumbling with some of the <br />
equipment. &nbsp; &nbsp; Ced pointed him out to B and Rod as the kid started using machines completely incorrectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, isn't dat Roger from school?&quot; Rod whispered to his two friends.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think, yah,&quot; came B's response.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Roger was a thin white kid, a freshman at the bodybuilders' old high school. He was pale, with red hair that couldn't be kept combed. He <br />
certainly wasn't a jock, and never got along with the geeks or nerds either. He really never could find his own clique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder why he's here? Maybe one of us should ask?&quot; B looked at his two bro's.<br />
<br />
Ced got up and approached the awkward teen. &quot;Yo, little bro, need some help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger looked up and nearly lost his balance. &quot;Y-y-y-ah,&quot; Roger was completely shocked as to why his big bodybuilder would talk to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What chu tryin' ta do? Don't look like ya work out too much.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sir, I don't really have any friends, and I was thinkin' I might be able to pick up some girls if I could put on a little size. Maybe get <br />
some respect, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm. You kinda remind me of how I used ta be. &nbsp;What if I told ya I could help you get like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger's eyes widened, &quot;Wow! That'd be cool! But I don't want to do steroids or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, man. We all cool. Come over here an let me introduce ya to my bro's.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the huge bodybuilder sauntered back over to the others, Roger timidly followed behind. B was grinning ear to ear, and had already <br />
keyed in Roger's changes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After introductions, and as Roger got a little more used to the hulking figures around him, B spoke up, &quot;Ok, bro, we'll teach ya all ya <br />
need ta know. First, gotta get some before pics so ya can track yer progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three led Roger into the locker room and found a back corner where they wouldn't be disturbed. B pulled out the emitter and aimed <br />
it at Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;That looks weird for a camera,&quot; Roger was a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jus' say cheese ma man, you about to be a new man,&quot; B pressed the button.<br />
<br />
Roger knew immediately that was no camera as he felt energy pass through him. He tried to move but he was fixed to the spot as he <br />
began to grow taller. He reached a height of 5'7 before his clothes disappeared.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He looked down, horrified, but didn't have time to react as his feet started pushing apart due to his quads and calves exploding into <br />
bodybuilder perfection.<br />
<br />
The feeling spread up to his groin, where, like the others, his package was augmented to porn star proportions. The new thickness and <br />
length was so heavy, it actually pulled on Roger's abdomen, which was quickly becoming an 8-pack. As he looked down, a solid black <br />
pair of posing trunks appeared, cradling his new manhood.<br />
<br />
Further up the boy the changes spread, hitting his pecs and back next. Chiseled pecs, the trophies of any bodybuilder now draped off <br />
Roger's body. The new sensation of his back made him feel impossibly thick and powerful. With his new lats, he knew he wouldn't be <br />
able to reach around to his back, the muscles were just too big.<br />
<br />
Delts and traps were next as his neck appeared to shorten under the new muscle. His shoulders thrust out to his sides, making his <br />
waist seem tiny by comparison. The V-taper of his back added to the illusion. Paired with the 20&quot; guns he now possessed, the kid was <br />
destined for a future in bodybuilding.<br />
<br />
While Roger was busy taking all that in, his features began morphing. His hair retracted back a bit and turned a bit kinky and jet black. It <br />
was longer on the top, but faded skin close on the sides. His head rounded out, and he began to develop cheekbones and a nose that <br />
bore more than a passing resemblance to Ced. &nbsp;In fact, his eyebrows arched and his eyes changed shape slightly, looking almost <br />
exactly like Ced. &nbsp;Ced was taking interest when a small diamond stud appeared in Roger's ear, completing his teen model look.<br />
<br />
Roger was busy poking the plates of muscle on his chest that he could now call &quot;his&quot; pecs, when in an instant he turned the color of <br />
milk chocolate.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What da-&quot; his new bass voice rumbled, not as low as the others, but definitely lower than most.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to da club. You a muscle brutha now fo sho!&quot; B admired his handiwork.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Roger looked down at himself and couldn't believe what he was seeing. He was black, and so big. He could actually feel the weight of <br />
his new muscles pulling on his frame. And his dick, pulling at his groin. The sensations woke the python and it began to stir. He felt his <br />
face, completely foreign to him now, and noticed the callouses on his hands from countless lifting sessions. He traced the veins snaking <br />
around his forearms, up his biceps and onto his wide shoulders. He looked over his pecs at his legs and saw more huge veins <br />
encasing his quads, going all the way down to his calves.<br />
<br />
He was wondering how he would maintain this awesome body when his new identity filled in the gaps. He was now 19 and a top teen <br />
bodybuilding competitor. His brother, Ced had gotten him into lifting when he was young, and he'd fallen in love with it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Roger looked, confused, at the three smiling hulking bodybuilders in front of him. Then his heritage hit him. All the information was too <br />
much, and Roger closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
The information stopped, the changes complete, and Rashad opened his eyes. &nbsp;He immediately snapped into a relaxed pose, displaying <br />
all his new power. He was 4 weeks out from his next competition and his bro and friends were coaching him in posing practice.<br />
<br />
Roger was still aware at what happened, but Rashad spoke, &quot;Hey man, thanks for da gif'!&quot; He excitedly ran his hands over his bulging <br />
muscles then ran over to B, grabbed his hand and clasped his other around B's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;An big bro! Dis is so weird, but I like it!&quot; he looked over to Ced.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries, man,&quot; B walked over to the two brothers. &quot;Welcome to da dark side haha! You got any friends ya want ta bring over?&quot;</p>
