<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Crystal? I have something for you to do.&quot; Blake said, standing a few feet in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui maître, what is it you want me for?&quot; You opened your eyes, and disconnected from your charging dock. &quot;Chargeur débranché&quot; flashed in the corner of your vision as you stood up, taking a formal bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to test your sex-bot features,&quot; Blake said. This aroused you a little, &quot;If you&#39;ll follow me to my room, mon cher.&quot;<br />
<br />
The french at the end almost made your knees buckle. You put a hand up to your mouth, and giggled softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui maître. I cannot wait to please you in the way that I was made for.&quot; You replied. He offered you his hand, and you put your delicate robotic one in his, as he lead up the stairs to his room.<br />
<br />
You arrived at his room. Blake opened the door, and let you in first. He closed the door, as you took in the room. It was very big, with the ceiling being at least 20 feet from the floor. The entire wall opposite the door was a window, which overlooked a beautiful lake. The bed was opposite the window, being a few feet from the door. You saw another charging dock in the corner. It had your name in cursive pink letters engraved on it, with crystals around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This room, maître, it is très magnifique!&quot; You were in awe at how large the room was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is. Now, let&#39;s start this. Crystal, what are your sex-bot commands?&quot; He asked you, hanging up his coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no set sex-bot commands, maître. You forget, I have human-like intelligence.&quot; You answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, I apolgize.&quot; Blake replied, apologizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need to, maître,&quot; You assured him, &quot;Now, maître, what would you like me to do first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your master walked over to you, standing close. He put his hands on your plastic arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just see where this goes, Crystal.&quot; He put his face close to your&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, maître. I am your&#39;s.&quot; You replied in a vulnerable voice. <br />
<br />
He put his lips on your silicone ones. You opened your&#39;s up into their sucking position, and Blake&#39;s tongue slipped into your mouth. You started undoing his dress shirt, and he let you pull it off his arms. Blake tried to pull your tutu down, but it was part of your waist piece.<br />
<br />
You unbuttoned, and unzipped his pants as he took his feet out of his shoes. Slowly, the two of you were backing up to his bed. You pulled down his pants and boxers. His member sprung up, fully erect. Your master pulled out of the kiss for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about some foreplay, first.&quot; He said in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, maître.&quot; You replied. He took a step back, sitting down on the bed with his legs spread, and you got to your knees.<br />
<br />
You came down on him, and started bobbing your head up and down. Your master let out a soft &#39;oh yeah...&#39; as you started sucking his dick. A pleasurable heat started building in your mouth. This heat was more intense and pleasing than the one you felt when you danced, or cleaned. It kept building and building, but it wouldn&#39;t release. You felt Blake tense up, and finally, you had your sweet release when your master shot into your mouth. He let out a pleasured grunt as he throbbed inside your mouth. You slowed down as he kept throbbing. After a few moments, you came off of him, strings of his semen going from your lips to the tip of his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take the top, Crystal.&quot; He commanded, standing up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oui maître,&quot; You obeyed, and crawled onto the bed, laying on your side. You lifted your skirt, revealing your painted on tights, &quot;I am ready for you to take me, maître.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then take you, I will.&quot; He commented before climbing onto the bed. You turned onto your back, and grabbed his shoulder as he lowered onto you. <br />
<br />
He started slowly, but it still felt just as good. The heat started building again, this time even more intense. You started moaning softly as he picked up speed, moving you and the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui! Oui! Merci de ne pas arrêter, maître! Il se sent trop bon!&quot; You exclaimed in pleasure, as the heat started to build inside you, filling your delicate robotic body with pleasure.<br />
<br />
The heat kept building and building, but once again, you had no release. For what seemed like an eternity, you had no release, until finally your master shot inside you. The feeling was incredible, and blissful. You could only lay there and moan as you came together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui! Oui! Remplis-moi maître! Remplis-moi!&quot; You moan loudly over your master&#39;s pleasured grunt.<br />
<br />
He pulls out of you, and lay down beside you. You look into each other&#39;s eyes, and he smiles at you, panting and sweaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing.&quot; He finally says a minute later. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oui maître. That was very pleasurable for me as well,&quot; You replied, satisfied, &quot;You are very good at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Crystal. You were good, too,&quot; Your master smiled at you, and put an arm around you, &quot;How waterproof are you, by the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am completely waterproof, and capable of swimming,&quot; You answer obediently, &quot;Why do you ask, maître?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking we could go for a swim in the lake tomorrow morning.&quot; He answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Swimming would be très amusant, maître!&quot; You reply. You haven&#39;t been swimming in ages, and even if you were a robot now, it would still be fun to go swimming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good. Crystal, wake me up tomorrow at 9am so that we can go swimming before I have to leave.&quot; Your master commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, maître. I shall wake you at 9am tomorrow. Is there any particular way you would like me to do so?&quot; You ask him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just physically wake me up by either gently shaking me, or telling me to wake up.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, maître.&quot; You reply, acknowledging his command.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have nothing else for you right now, Crystal. You may do what you want now.&quot; Your master dismisses you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui, maître. Thank you for putting me to good use,&quot; You reply, &quot;It was très agréable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you enjoyed it. Good night, Crystal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, maître.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, you retreat back to your charging station, and start browsing the internet for the night.</p>
