<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the donkey&#39;s body was fully satisfied, Matt regained enough mental control to focus on his primary objective. He&#39;d had the experience of discovering what it was like to swap bodies with a smelly, ugly donkey. He was more than ready to reverse the swap and regain his human form.<br />
<br />
That meant getting the jenny interested again. Matt clomped his heavy hooves over the pasture ground and made his way toward her. She had retreated to the shade offered by a large tree. Matt suspect that the jenny and the jack who had previous occupied his current body had spent a lot of their time in the shade beneath the tree because the ground was hard packed and devoid of any plants.<br />
<br />
The jenny meticulously ignored him. <br />
<br />
Matt &quot;smiled&quot; at her, pulling back his rubbery lips and exposing his blocky teeth, which had the misfortune at the moment of being covered with shredded green vegetations left from his grazing. <br />
<br />
She kept ignoring him.<br />
<br />
Matt wondered if he should have approached her at the ready. His cock hadn&#39;t emerged from his sheath after the incident with the farmhand and the water hose. The knowledge that he needed the ugly female donkey to get his own body back didn&#39;t do anything to stir excitement in his new donkey loins. <br />
<br />
Prior to the swap, he could have just fondled his cock into an erection, but now he had hooves. He felt the hard casings stomp down on the packed earth. He felt like his hands had been trapped but were still available if he could only remove the damnable hooves.<br />
<br />
He felt a stirring then. His cock emerged from the sheath, but what happened next was more mortifying than exciting. He started urinating, producing a gusher of foul yellow-green piss that puddled on the hard packed earth that was unable to soak up the liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Matt could only bray his curse.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t intended... his donkey body, though, had needed to piss just like it had needed to graze earlier.<br />
<br />
And once he started, he couldn&#39;t stop. The foul urine continued to pour from the end of his absurdly long cock, the puddle widened and deepened, and the jenny finally looked at him.<br />
<br />
She then huffed with an exhalation of air from her nostrils and moved off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Matt brayed. He started to go after her, but his cock was still gushing, and he only ended up splashing the piss on his forelegs. <br />
<br />
But the realization that he was making himself filthier and nastier by his own actions helped solve one problem. By the time he had emptied the donkey&#39;s bladder, the humiliation of the experience had caused his cock to fully harden.<br />
<br />
Oh, for hands! He wanted to grab his straining erection and stroke, an impossibility with his hooves. He swung his huge head back and forth, scanning for the jenny. He stepped back and landed his back hooves in the puddle of his own still warm urine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking gross!&quot; He brayed loudly.<br />
<br />
That beastly bray echoed in his ungainly ears. <br />
<br />
His donkey cock bobbed and swayed as he made his way toward the jenny, hoping she&#39;d be more cooperative.<br />
<br />
She swung her head away from him when Matt walked to her side. <br />
<br />
The donkey body now wanted this as much as he did, so it didn&#39;t take rejection as final.<br />
<br />
He stomped the ground, brayed some more, and nuzzled at her mane. She still didn&#39;t show much enthusiasm, but she did permit him to get his forelegs sprawled over her back as he tried to connect his cock with...<br />
<br />
Of course, the Chronivac, registering his near success, launched its programming into action. <br />
<br />
As a result, Matt experienced the unpleasant sensation of feeling a sharp, unexpected tug at the bridle that the old donkey had been wearing at the time of the swap.<br />
<br />
His blurry vision finally focused. The farmhand again!<br />
<br />
Matt brayed a protest. Although the farm worker didn&#39;t know why he had suddenly felt the need to hitch the donkey to one of the plows and break some ground, he didn&#39;t question it.<br />
<br />
After he got the pack animal harnessed to the plow, Matt stood his ground, his inglorious erection evident to one and all.<br />
<br />
The hand removed a prod from a holder latched to his belt. He used it more often for truculent bulls, but he didn&#39;t have any problem using it on a stubborn jackass.<br />
<br />
The first zap lightly against his flank convinced Matt to cooperate more fully. Minutes into the grueling labor of pulling the plow, Matt&#39;s cock withered and returned defeated again to its sheath. If it had been left up to the donkey, it would have held its ground. But Matt was made of less stern material and crumpled instantly.<br />
<br />
A few hours of the hard labor of pulling the plow left him too exhausted to even think about anything remotely connected to sex.</p>
