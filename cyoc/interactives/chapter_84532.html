<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elise smiled having arrived in the new bustling town. She had her vehicle and knew everything that had happened to her best friend. She was so excited to have been meeting her friend. Though she was curious if perhaps Flake&#39;s other friends could engineer a new kind of kat out of what she&#39;s got. She managed to, being a scientist as well and know a lot about the species, had pulled up, the thing was hidden in amber, making it hard to see. She hadn&#39;t even shown her colligues at the museum back in Seattle.  She had two finds in her truck, fortunately it was hidden well that no one asked about it.<br />
<br />
Elise smiled stopping just as she got into town. For a moment it reminded her of a town in the old west. But she heard of Janice a few times. The two ambers were found in two seperate locations. One deep in the heart of the Arabian desert and the other was in death valley. But she was proud of her discovery, but that&#39;s not the importance of business. Flake was. She climbed out and seen her. &quot;Kelsy.&quot; Elise walked up and hugged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Flake now, dear. And it&#39;s good to see you too.&quot; Flake responded with a hug of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Flake, as I am to see you. But I got something, and other than me and a few others, you&#39;ll be the very first to see these. I told you I went on digs. They said what we dug up we can keep. So I kept these.&quot; She pointed at her truck. &quot;However I feel I should show all here. Consider these a donation to the museum here in this town. Should it get one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flake looked walking up. &quot;Oh? And what exactly are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see soon enough.&quot; She said walking up. &quot;Now can I meet those who mad you into such a beautiful creature?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sure.&quot; Flake smiled leading her into the lab.<br />
<br />
There they were prepping Charlie for what they needed. Flake smiled and walked up. &quot;Getting Charlie ready I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy nodded. &quot;Yes. We&#39;re turning him into a Mantikat. Though wish we had an actual one, it&#39;d make it easier but, as Talia stated, there are no traces left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I uh, wouldn&#39;t be too sure on that.&quot; Elise spoke up. &quot;If you&#39;re talking about what I think you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who&#39;s your friend Flake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Auntie Snow, this is Elise. She came to Paris when she was studding abroad. She&#39;s an archeologist.&quot; Flake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Archeowhat, now?&quot; Maurice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems even a scientist is limited on all things.&quot; Flake smiled. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Aunt Maurice. I&#39;ll explain. Have you visited a museum and seen the dino bones?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Maurice says. &quot;But what does that have to do with and Archeologist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She digs them up and stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright.&quot; Shi nodded. &quot;I get ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise looked. &quot;I think I might have what you&#39;re looking for. Or something resembling the ones in legends.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to see.&quot; Talia said. &quot;I can confirm what it is. I&#39;ve killed a fair share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... I think this one is as old as the ice age.&quot; Elise said leading them outside.<br />
<br />
Talia looks. &quot;Now that would be worth seeing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise then led them out to her ambers. With all in Janice looking on, Charlie with something stuck to hir stinger, regardless how Sally felt, she only laughed at how silly he looked. Grant it she like how he was spending time with the two, and how, instead of them both carrying one he was carrying both. But she knew what he was and looked forward to when her mate would be furry again.<br />
<br />
Elise uncovered them and to their surprise was a very very well preserved Velosiraptor and in the other a feline like creature, tail all fuzzy, but at the very end was an end like a scorpion tail. And even that had a tiny bit of fuzz on it. Maurice smiled looking at hir mate. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get them inside and extract the DNAs to see what we can do with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was midnight when they finally had the DNA from the ancient feline, for they couldn&#39;t find a drill bit long enough and thick enough to get in. Maurice was up until dawn the next morning trying to figure it out. Once he finally did he smiled and fell asleep right there. Snowy who was at home with the kittens was sleeping, knowing Maurice was working away at helping Charlie, who was his best friend now.  Charlie was sleeping outside guarding the door to his home while his mate and kittens and pups slept. Midnight and Talia however were on the other side of town, watching the stars.<br />
<br />
Talia was going on about how her and Anubis got into a fight, and explained that the ones that the egyptians worshiped weren&#39;t really gods, but more pharohs and they saw that once you&#39;re a pharoh, you become a god depending if you were a wonderful leader or an extremely cruel one.  When shi told Midnight about raping Anubis in the ass, midnight only laughed.<br />
<br />
As the sun rose though, Maurice was back to work, preparing the new setitive that was going to make Charlie as much a chakat as possible. What they didn&#39;t know is this one was more similar to a Saber like manticore as opposed to the other one that was mentioned. Charlie was sitting there waiting as Maurice struggled to find a good spot to inject. Charlie thought. &quot;Um... Maurice, try my pincher.&quot; Shi smiled lowering hir picher.<br />
<br />
Maurice nodded. &quot;Right.&quot; He reached up and injected right into the pincher. Charlie winced at the pain. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. Though one thing I will miss is these things. They helped around the house. Though It&#39;s this or I wind up as Sally&#39;s meet slicer and can opener or I become her mate.&quot; Shi smiled.<br />
<br />
Maurice laughed. &quot;True.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Charlie sat there, the girls hopped off hir back. First to happen was his arms shrunk down until they vanished. Followed by his pinchers, they shrunk until they became furry arms. He smiled waving them. &quot;Ah, hands. I have hands again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, you had hands as a Scorpkat.&quot; Sally only giggled at the sillyness.<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded as his face became furry and pushed out to a cats face, but what caught him off guard was the long teeth that shot strait down. &quot;Oh that&#39;ll make things interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, love. But more pleasureable for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded. &quot;Oh I can&#39;t wait to test them out.&quot; Shi said as hir body rose up away from the ground as hir small legs grew to be feline like. The body becoming more round and readjusting in shape. Once that was done it moved to hir chest, which was altering into hir old shaped chest and this time all furry. When things were done there, hir breasts came out. But what was a surprise was, shi grew a second pair. Shi then looked at them, examining their fullness. &quot;Wow, quadtits.&quot; The final changes were behind hir. Hir sheath and cock had returned, with hir normal pussy. Fur migrated up the tail, stopping dead right at the ball of the tail which houses the glands for the poison, or in this case, the vaccine. The changes finally stopped when shi started to purr. Shi looked and walked over to hir mate. &quot;Sally.&quot; The two hugged closely, as Charlie looked at Elise. &quot;Thank you. You provided what we really needed, and much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice looked at hir and then walked up. &quot;Hmmm.... looks like it locked there. So we&#39;ll see what we can do then, but for now, we need a sample to see if it changed the vaccine.&quot; Maurice produced another cup.<br />
<br />
Charlie deposited some of hir venom stuff in, this time it was strait silver. Maurice then put it with the original strand of the virus, and the stuff stopped it from growing, but infact stopped it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s different. But we won&#39;t really know until it&#39;s been field tested.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they walked out Sammy ran up. &quot;Guys, our eggs, they... they&#39;re hatching finally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Charlie looked over. &quot;Well, shall we go get a drink? I&#39;m thirsty. And Elise, should you need anything, let us know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise nodded. &quot;There is. You see, the raptor one, I was wanting to see if you can&#39;t engineer it into a kat, to where I uh... uh... can... you know. Be like you guys, and I want it to be taur like, not bipedal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice smiled. &quot;For helping my friend. I won&#39;t rest, well figuratively speaking, until that is done, my dear.&quot; Maurice smiled.</p>
