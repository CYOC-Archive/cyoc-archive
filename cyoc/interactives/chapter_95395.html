<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Turning around, it was her mother. Jennifer blushed profusely as she tried to seem innocent, as if she hadn&#39;t just taken a shit the size of Mount Vesuvius in Kimberly&#39;s locker. Her mother started to come closer, her high heels click clacking on the linoleum of the hallway floor. That sound was about to send Jennifer over the edge. How could she have pooped in Kimberly&#39;s locker? She could have just stolen the bitch&#39;s boyfriend, but no, she had to shit and masturbate in her locker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer? What are you doing out here? You should be in class!&quot; Her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing, Mom. I just had to use the bathroom.&quot; Jennifer said. It technically wasn&#39;t a lie.<br />
<br />
Her mother chuckled. &quot;Oh, sweetie, I know you use your pants as a bathroom. What was my baby girl really doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared at her mother, mouth wide open. Just yesterday, her mother had yelled at her for taking a huge dump in his panties, and now it was like she thought it was normal. What the hell had Kyle done now? <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell Mommy what you were doing.&quot; Her mother, Hazel, said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jennifer felt compelled to tell her mother what she had done. &quot;I took a shit in Kimberly&#39;s locker because she made fun of me for pooping myself in study hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hazel clicked her tongue. &quot;I knew you being in a big girl school would be nothing but trouble. The teasing, forcing you not only to use the potty, but teaching you the wrong place to do it, and they&#39;ve taught you no-no words. You&#39;re much too little for a place like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What  are you talking about, Mom? I&#39;m sixteen. I&#39;m supposed to go to high school! And the big cheer leading competition is today! I&#39;m captain and I have to be there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jennifer, I&#39;m your mother and I think you&#39;re too little. Maybe you need a place that&#39;s more nurturing for when Mommy can&#39;t be there. But I guess you can stay for your little cheer leading thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to stay until I finish high school! Why did you choose to have this fucking mental breakdown today?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hazel gasped. &quot;Such a naughty word! We&#39;re going to see the principal right now. After your competition, you&#39;ll be going to a different school. That&#39;s final.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hazel grabbed Jennifer&#39;s wrist, dragging her towards the front office. On their way, they passed a janitor, whom Hazel stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, my daughter made a rather large poopy in locker 437 and it needs to be cleaned up.&quot; Hazel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she need her ass wiped, too? I can do that as well.&quot; The janitor offered.<br />
<br />
Hazel smiled. &quot;How kind. Could you? She smells a bit ripe. Pull down your skirt, honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer did as she was told, eyes watering as she saw the janitor grab a handful of toilet tissue. She could believe her mom would humiliate her like this. She felt the janitor&#39;s paper covered hand start to clean her hole and gasped as one of his fingers went inside. It felt...good. Not good enough to arouse her, but good. <br />
<br />
&quot;All finished, ma&#39;am. Her panties are covered in skid marks. That&#39;s probably what you&#39;re smelling.&quot; The janitor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you anyway.&quot; Hazel said, pulling Jennifer to the office once more.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s face was crimson by the time they got to the principal&#39;s office. To make things worse, her stomach was growling and her breasts were beginning to fill with milk. She knew she would have to drink from them soon. Hazel sat Jennifer in a chair in the principal&#39;s office, anger etched on her face. They would be her e a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Hazel. Nice to see you again. What seems to be the problem?&quot; The principal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter is being harassed by other students and they are teaching her disgusting words. You said this was a safe space.&quot; Hazel snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation already bored Jennifer. She began trying to free one of her breasts so she could eat. She was starving. She managed to get it out of her top and put the nipple in her mouth, moaning as the sweet milk hit her tongue. She began drinking eagerly, feeling a tingle down below. There was no stopping what was coming.<br />
<br />
She allowed nature to take its course. The first turd poked out of her hole and she pushed, grunting as it coiled and broke off and she began pushing out another huge log. This one stretched out her asshole, making her pant and grunt around her nipple. Her mom and the principal had stopped to watch her at this point, looking both in awe and shock as the stinky turds created a globe sized mass in her elastic cheer panties. Jennifer, enjoying the attention, decided to put on a good show. She stuck her hand in her pants and began fingering herself, moaning as her nipple fell from her mouth. Her poop was piling up nicely, some of it escaping from the leg holes to make room for each new log. She grunted, sending log of shit nearly five inches wide into her panties, stretching them to the max as she finally had her orgasm. Quickly, she shoved her boob back in her mouth to continue drinking, mushing around in her mess. The principal cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh, I agree that you should take her elsewhere. We aren&#39;t equipped to deal with such matters. She may stay for the competition, but by tomorrow, she will be moved, yes?&quot; The principal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely. Thank you for understanding. Come on, Jennifer. We have to get you cleaned up before the competition.&quot; Hazel said.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nodded and got up to follow, waddling due to the load in her pants. She felt her phone buzz and reached into her bra to get it.<br />
<br />
From Kyle: How do you like your new Mommy? From now on, you&#39;ll be her baby. Her very smelly, shitty baby.</p>
