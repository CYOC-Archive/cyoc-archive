<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...one of these options. His hands shook with much more intensity as the full gravity of the situation set in. Not only was he a woman, but his girlfriend had turned into a pair of panties...a pair of panties that were currently hugging tightly on his tight pussy and fat ass. Ugh...the former was still making him feel distracted and far more aroused than he felt like he should have given the situation. He had instinctually begun to tap his finger on the all-powerful device to try to calm himself down. Inadvertently, however, he had clicked the button to take the photo, aiming down at Emily, but his thick legs were taking up about half of the frame as well! His eyes widened in shock in the brief moment where he realized what he had done before the camera went off with a...<br />
<br />
FLASH!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Emily rubbed her head --  readjusting to physical sensations aside from touch. Despite living in a human form all her life and only being near inanimate for a few minutes, fulfilling the simple role as a pair of panties and little else was incredibly easy to fall into. Therefore, it was just as disorienting to shift back into the complex anatomy and life of a person. However, she had little reprieve as attention drew to something holding onto her chest.<br />
<br />
She blinked a number of times and looked down as limited eyesight returned to her. It was a red blur held right below a large porcelain one. She also gleamed that it was sliding to a white smear...the floor? Her hearing came next in muffled bursts...were those whines? It was difficult to tell what these things actually were, given her current state of transition. Thankfully, Emily&#39;s new instincts were sharp enough to realize what was feebly grasping onto her before even she did. A baby. The woman&#39;s arms scooped them up in the nick of time before the child lost their grip entirely -- preventing potential disaster.<br />
<br />
Her senses fully acclimated as she held the child close -- now cognizant enough to recognize her own body. She first saw what the porcelain blur actually was; they were big fat tits, comparable in size to her own mother&#39;s, barely held within a yellow blouse! Fitting, considering it was easy to gather this new reality had made Emily a mother herself. At the very least, she was a woman again, even if an older one. Due to her relative familiarity with such a form, her attention drew itself over to the infant. Given how he was the only other person in the stall with her when the change occurred, the woman knew this had to be Rick. She was now a parent to her former boyfriend! Well, that wasn&#39;t much different than Rick being her mother for a while, Emily supposed...and nowhere near as jarring or embarrassing as becoming his undergarments. She shook off her past feelings for the moment as she looked over Rick the baby.<br />
<br />
He looked to be healthy: pale pink in hue, chubby from large amounts of fat, and so petite he couldn&#39;t have been more than a few months old. Hugged within a red onesie and within Emily&#39;s arms, he babbled and pouted -- clearly trying to vocalize his frustrations and showing he was still aware. Of course, with his appearance, he was simply adorable and not intimidating at all. Emily was soon able to gather, from closer inspection that part of that may have been because he was...well...actually physically still a she! Emily couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, as she began to rock her previous partner. &quot;Jeez, Rick, it&#39;s like this camera *wants* you to be a girl, even on &#39;random&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick didn&#39;t take the teasing well, being grumpier than ever. This was how Emily was treating him after saving her!? He wasn&#39;t a baby...okay, he literally was right now, but that was besides the point! She should have been thanking him, and transforming him back into a guy again and...and letting them have nap time, and feeding them! Especially feeding them! They were hungry! So hungry! This form&#39;s undeveloped mind was taking hold of the former man in full force, nearly whining out more incomprehensible gibberish. Before they did so, they sniffed at the air...a sweet aroma filling their small nostrils. Their own instincts took hold as they remembered how they could feed themselves. Yes...no more hunger! They used their small hands to awkwardly pull down the blouse, positioned themselves to have their head reach the exposed nipple...and began sucking out the delicious milk. Their mommy&#39;s milk...<br />
<br />
The series of events happened too quickly for Emily to stop, leaving her slack jawed -- something she hadn&#39;t expected to still be able to do with how much this camera had done to the both of them. Rick was feeding on her!? She let out small groans as her tits shot streams of milk into the infant&#39;s mouth. From how they were sucking, Emily knew that this wasn&#39;t meant to be a joke or something done to get back at her teasing...the baby was really seeking sustenance through her boobs! She wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable with this, but at the same time, there was no way she was just going to pull them away -- especially given her impulses as a mother. Thus, with hesitation, she allowed the baby (who wasn&#39;t in the right state of mind to truly be called Rick) to finish. The liquid drained out for several long, embarrassing minutes, with Emily unable to look away. Finally, they pulled back...only to reach out to the other breast. Emily gulped as the partly-incognizant Rick looked up with expecting beady blue eyes.<br />
<br />
God...dammit...<br />
<br />
Emily pulled up one side of her blouse and pulled down the other. She even adjusted the child to be able to suckle the second teat, pressing them closer to it. The newborn started the process anew with no hesitation -- awareness not even being considered in their cute tiny head. Emily couldn&#39;t bear to see this again. She continued to groan as she looked around in her confined space, hoping to find the camera to change both of them back...she felt like she may have had enough of its reality alterations for today...</p>
