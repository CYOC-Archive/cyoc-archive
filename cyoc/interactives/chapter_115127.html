<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even when Hank was very young, he had been told how ‘special’ he was. In his small suburban city, as they were indeed pretty rare, there was supposedly only one other boytaur; they had never met. Rumor has it that their parents were ashamed and afraid, and therefore kept their son away from the public. Therefore, it wasn’t common for him to see or hear about another of his kind during his youth, but other people were very much aware of their existence, and swore that he wasn’t alone. Thus, he was treated like any other person. By that point, he had had several awkward encounters with other kids, adults - even animals. So it wasn’t like Hank wasn’t able to handle the stares. <br />
<br />
He was also told that, as he got older, he would notice many of the physical differences between himself and others. For example, he’d be bigger than regular people; as big as a horse, even. By age nine, he was already taller than his parents, and by age fifteen, he was seven and a half feet tall. And that was only the beginning of his growth spurt, as high school had brought forth an entirely new slew of “challenges.”<br />
<br />
The social and personal changes of a high schooler affected Hank, as well. Despite his outwardly appearance, Hank was still very popular. But it was always for different reasons, which frustrated him. Because of his doubled physique, he had twice the testosterone level of human men. His father, poorly explaining how sex worked, told him the obvious: “You have two; we have one.” It never meant much to Hank as a kid, but once he hit puberty, the noticeable differences created problems. Mantaurs were almost always bisexual or homosexual, and everyone knew this. <br />
<br />
Back in middle school, he had some positive memories of doing various sports, singing in the men’s choir, and working as a caddie at the local golf course. His increased size and strength, as he reached high school, had <i>many</i> benefits. Both women and men gawked at his sheer athletic strength and endurance. Having four legs was a plus when running the mile in Phys Ed class.<br />
<br />
But despite knowing better, despite the knowledge and his better judgment, he had always been like this: a mantaur...<br />
<br />
..This thought, and tons of others, all breezed through Hank’s brain as he was shoved out the door - father’s bare hand on his naked ass - and greeted by Jeff and his five friends.<br />
<br />
“Good morning, Hank! How’s it hangin’?”<br />
<br />
> Hank thought to himself. He felt bent and distorted, multiplied and … it was just wrong. If he wanted to move his left leg, both front and back legs lifted up.<br />
<br />
Through much harassment and corralling, Hank’s father strapped the saddle onto his lower back, and Jeff eagerly hopped on. The sudden weight of another person on him nearly toppled him over.<br />
<br />
It was so foreign, but his mind kept telling him everything was okay. Why was this <i>happening</i> to him? Having someone riding him… just like a horse! It was so submissive. And right at that moment, a familiar but unnerving feeling arose from within.<br />
<br />
> Hank thought. He was getting horny, and it wasn’t from his magazines or a girl at the mall; It was these guys! He felt the urge down low between his legs, as it had always been, but he was also feeling it under his back legs. It… it felt different, and good… but he couldn’t let this happen while naked?! Why was it okay for him to be naked?<br />
<br />
“So Hank…?”<br />
<br />
Hank snapped out of it with Jeff’s voice coming from behind.<br />
<br />
“Hank…” Jeff repeated, curious of the thoughts brewing in Hank’s mind. “Uhm, how are you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what’s going on, and I’m butt-naked, and I’m supposed to carry a guy to school. Also, you’re not Jeff, you look nothing like that loser.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hadn’t told him who he was, but somehow he knew. So he played along. “But Hank, you always carry me to school. Ever since your dad worked out that deal with my parents. $25 a day.”<br />
<br />
As if it were magic, the memory entered Hank’s mind. Easy money for himself and his family… plus, he… liked the feeling?<br />
<br />
“And I’m disappointed that you would call me a loser… what’s wrong? Don’t you … like how I look?”<br />
<br />
The temptation caused his cocks to twitch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He took a deep, but choppy breath, mustering every bit of patience he had left. He was a bit afraid, but … this was just a dumb dream. A very, very lucid - but dumb - dream. He’d snap out of it; he’d wake up and this shit would be over, and he could figure out what made him have these sick thoughts in the first place.<br />
<br />
“Whatever. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
“Cool. But what about the other guys?”<br />
<br />
Hank turned around to Jeff, with heightened eyebrows. Excuse me… <i>what?</i><br />
<br />
One of the other guys’ eyes perked up, but was shut down by a taller dude: “Nah, don’t worry, we’ll walk to school today. Uh… have fun, guys.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourselves. More for me…”<br />
<br />
, Hank thought. These guys were disgusting, and so gay. When would he kick out of this? <br />
<br />
He reluctantly walked forward, with the added weight on his back, Jeff’s hands and legs straddling his sides as he left his house for high school campus.</p>
