<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Isaac wait!”<br />
<br />
Ilivir turned around to see Nat barely out of sight. Annoyance building up within him, he hollered back. “What do you want?”<br />
<br />
The young looking woman yelled back. “You agreed to be my teacher! When are we going to train?!”<br />
<br />
Ilivir was already opening up his metal cock pouch. “I’ll train you when I come back!”<br />
<br />
Not waiting any longer, Ilivir left the girl to her own devices. Isaac will come back. He always comes back. He’ll leave the training to him.<br />
<br />
As he walked, he went back to doing what he has been doing for awhile now… thinking.<br />
<br />
He is finally in control of Isaac’s body! Now what? Nothing really changed. Isaac WILL regain control no mater what Ilivir could do. He’s just too strong.<br />
<br />
Ever since Isaac absorbed his soul into his halo, he has begun remembering a lot of things from his corrupted life. The things he did as a werewolf, his life as Isaac’s spawn, and most importantly… His life from before his corruption.<br />
<br />
As Ilivir walked through the forest, he thought back to the last time he had sex as a human. It was with that female wolf. That session was more mind blowing then he could have imagined. He even used his powers of purity to burn away some of the corruption just to extend his session. Once he was fully turned, he just kept on fucking her. His memory after he became a corrupt is a little foggy, but he thinks he remembered that fucking to last for days. It was probably the best he had in his life. Thinking back, he kinda remembers having children with that corrupted wolf woman. He’s not sure how many however. Nor did he remember his mate’s name… That was only the first of many mates he had… <br />
<br />
Looking back, all those fucking sessions… became boring after awhile. Sex was all he did as a werewolf. He didn’t even need to eat so as long he fucked. And as much as it surprises him… He actually missed being human. <br />
<br />
There were so many things he wanted to do back in the day. Like becoming an artist, building up his cottage, and maybe do more research. But after all this time, he still hasn’t been able to do any of that. As satisfying life as a sex animal was… was it really worth it?<br />
<br />
Ever since Isaac mentioned the history of the dark knights back at the mansion, Ilivir has been… silently listening, remembering and… thinking... <br />
<br />
What does he want?<br />
<br />
Isaac has been talking not knowing whether he should choose being a Dark Knight or Paladin… <br />
<br />
Ilivir on the other hand… always wanted to be a Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
After he first witnessed those two werewolves fucking, he’s been wanting to become a Dark Knight and feel that pleasure…<br />
<br />
But then the last Dark Knight up and died before he could teach Ilivir how to be a Dark Knight. So he did the next best thing and became one of the first paladins. The first division of paladins had to study the Dark Knight’s ways and figure out how to use their methods to counteract corruption. Hence the focus on using purity instead of corruption. Of course, Ilivir studied the Dark Knight’s ways only to keep his humanity while having sex with the corrupt. And he had many sex sessions with the corrupt before turning…<br />
<br />
But what is he going to do now? Years of his life gone, because he wanted to become an animal. His world is completely different from his time. Even if he had his own human body again, what was he gonna do with it? Everyone he knew is gone. And that paladin… He is supposedly from a long line of paladins… and line he helped start. Ilivir is not sure what to think of that. Why is Isaac is so adamant on ending something that has been part of their lives for so long?<br />
<br />
There is one thing Ilivir knows for sure however. Isaac intends on ending the corruption. But without the corruption… Then what would happen next? Corruption has been so integral to the kingdom for so long, that it’s are almost reliant on it. He doesn’t mind not having corrupt sex anymore, but just ending it sounds so… simple.  For some reason he can’t put his finger on, Ilivir just knows that Isaac is wrong somehow. That ending the corruption won’t automatically make things better.<br />
<br />
Ilivir’s face held grimly at that thought.<br />
<br />
Sometimes he wonders why does he put up with Isaac. <br />
<br />
Isaac is going to make a mistake he can’t take back... And Ilivir will be there waiting for the right moment to stop him.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Right there.” A distinctly feminine voice sounded out.<br />
<br />
Illivir followed the voice until he found a misty nest filled with cloud harpies. But more importantly… they are all having female sex with each other.<br />
<br />
The very sight of such an expertly executed sex session was… very nostalgic for Ilivir. It made him desire something more pleasurable then the baby air dragon’s sucking.<br />
<br />
Ilivir slowly approached the harpy orgy…<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?”<br />
<br />
Without stopping their sex session by a single beat, the harpies turn to Ilivir and ansered him in a casual fashion. “Hello stranger? Want to join in? We could use some fertilization.”<br />
<br />
As much as Ilivir wanted to do them anyways, he was surprised by how open they were about it. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Please.”<br />
<br />
The harpies made room for Ilivir to walk in the nest while not once stopping their sex session.<br />
<br />
As he entered the nest, one of the harpies presented her pussy to Ilivir while at the same licking the pussy of another harpy.<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for? If you are not going to fertilize our eggs, then leave before we claw your eyes out.” One of the many harpies urged. This one had sharper and thicker feathers than the others. It’s a wonder none of them got hurt during sex.<br />
<br />
Ilivir didn’t waste any time. He immediately willed his metal pouch to open, exposing the corrupted baby air dragon to the world. <br />
<br />
With disdain, he gently removed the offspring of one of his captors. The harpies ogled the baby air dragon in awe.<br />
<br />
“What is that?!” A harpy with fancy feathers said.<br />
<br />
“Is that an air dragon?! I haven’t seen one in awhile!” Another harpy said.<br />
<br />
A harpy with soft, fluffy feathers came up to Ilivir and held out her hands. “Can I hold it, can I hold it?!”<br />
<br />
Ilivir shrugged his shoulders. He really doesn’t care. But he also doesn’t want to deal with Isaac if he does ditch the baby.<br />
<br />
He gently handed the baby to the fluffy harpy. “Give it back to me when I finish… “fertilizing” your eggs…”<br />
<br />
The fluffy harpy girl gave the man a salute. “Yes sir! I will take care child!”<br />
<br />
The mention of children didn’t phase Ilivir. He had a lot of corrupt children back in his time. Right now, all he cares about is old fashioned mating.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just do this.” He said as he approached the harpies with his twin dripping lizard cocks ready and waiting. <br />
<br />
But to Ilivir’s surprise, they were already a step above him. The sharp feathered one already plunged one of the dripping cocks into her mouth. The fancy feathered harpy went straight to plunging the too-big-cock into her much smaller vagina. As soon as they were connected, they began sucking and humping more expertly and professionally then the baby air dragon could ever do.<br />
<br />
In an instant, both of Ilivir’s cocks cummed… but for some reason… He’s just as clear headed as ever.<br />
<br />
“You seem to be no stranger to this.” A smart looking harpy surmised. “Most of our mates couldn’t keep a straight face, much less talk coherently.”<br />
<br />
“No… I am not.” Ilivir answered. Maybe he gotten used to sex after spending so many years doing it.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
And so, Ilivir has one of the most refreshing sex sessions in a long time. The harpies and Ilivir knew exactly what to do to keep things interesting. Whenever Ilivir tried to change things up, the harpies kept pace. He may not know them for very long, but already, the harpies felt like kindred spirits when it comes to sex. He never expected to meet anyone able to exceed anyone in the crypt when it comes to strategic sex. <br />
<br />
Despite their bubbly aura, these harpies seem to be very intelligent…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“You feel lost.” A random harpy stated suddenly. Surprise flickered on Ilivir’s face.<br />
<br />
“W-what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
The smart harpy rolled her eyes. “You had sex for so long, it had lost meaning to you.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Another harpy answered. “Come now… We have sex every day. We know these things.”<br />
<br />
Ilivir held his head down. They are right. He wasn’t sure what was wrong until they spelled it out to him. <br />
<br />
“Then what about you? Is that why you are talking to me so casually?”<br />
<br />
The harpies giggled at the thought. <br />
<br />
“Kinda.” Another one of them answered. “Us harpies are naturally horny.”<br />
<br />
“So we make a point to get all the sex out once a day!” Another harpy chipped in.<br />
<br />
“That way, we can spend the rest of the day doing other things in life.”<br />
<br />
“Like scavenging for food!” The sharp one said.<br />
<br />
“And taking care of the kids!” The fluffy one said as she played with the baby air dragon.<br />
<br />
“And learning new things!” The smart one added.<br />
<br />
“And having a family!” The fancy feather harpy inserted.<br />
<br />
“Yes, we also take our time to raise our kids.” The smart looking one inserted.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm….” Was all Ilivir could muster. <br />
<br />
Thinking back, he never really stayed with any of his mates… or bothered to learn their names. He didn’t care… But sometimes he does wonder what happened to his children. Do they remember him? Probably not. He didn’t even stick around long enough to name them…<br />
<br />
“You see, male harpies are rarely ever born, so we must mate with males from other species. So whenever one comes to mate with us, we welcome them with open arms.” The smart one explained.<br />
<br />
“We had so many mates, we got pretty good at judging their character. We can tell that You spent so much time having sex, that you didn’t really stop to consider what to do with your life.” The smart harpy continued.<br />
<br />
“Sex is only one part of nature. It’s not the only thing to do. I wish our many mates realized that…”<br />
<br />
That piqued Ilivir’s interest. “What happen to your mates…?”<br />
<br />
“Most of them just left. Not many of them even bothered to get to know us. Many males from many different species sees us having sex and joins in… but not many of them really stuck around.”<br />
<br />
“…”<br />
<br />
“You seem to know what we are talking about. Most of our mates are first timers or perverts and usually don’t understand what we meant.”<br />
<br />
“We want a family!” The fluffy harpy shouted.<br />
<br />
 “…What are your names? Do you have names?” For some reason, Ilivir wanted to get to know these strangers.<br />
<br />
“My name is Kitty!” The fluffy harpy eagerly answered. “My father was a mountain lion!”<br />
<br />
“My name is Scyla.” The sharp feathered harpy answered. “Most of us weren&#39;t born yet when my father came. And those who were around at the time don’t even know what species he was.”<br />
<br />
”My name is Yulivia.” The fancy feathered harpy announced.<br />
<br />
“My name is Len.” The smart one simply said.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
And so… The next few moments were spent by the harpies introducing them one at a time.<br />
<br />
There were so many of them…<br />
<br />
 Each of them took the time during their introductions to display just how unique each of them are from each other.<br />
<br />
Normally… Ilivir couldn’t care less about names… but for some reason, this time is different…<br />
<br />
Despite the numerous names Ilivir had to memorize, all of them were so uniquely memorable, that he inexplicable remember all their names.<br />
<br />
After the last harpy introduced herself, it was Ilivir’s turn…<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
<br />
“My name is Iliv- Isaac.”<br />
<br />
Kitty blinked in confusion. “Ilivaac?”<br />
<br />
Ilivir waved his hands in dismissal. “No, no. It’s just Isaac.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh…” Len tested.<br />
<br />
“Yay! I finally get to learn the name of our mate!” Kitty cheered.<br />
<br />
“Is that so uncommon?” Ilivir questioned.<br />
<br />
“You’d be surprised.” Yulivia noted.<br />
<br />
Ilivir scratched his arm uncomfortably. “Um… I’m sorry to say this… But I do need to leave eventually.”<br />
<br />
The harpies gave him knowing looks.<br />
<br />
“We expected that much. It’s rare for a mate to stay with us.” Len stated.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Ilivir could help but feel some guilt. “So… let’s make the most of our time together. And maybe someday… I’ll come back and visit you… Maybe even stay with you one day.”<br />
<br />
“Yay! Mating buddies!” Kitty cheered.<br />
<br />
Ilivir had no idea why he just said that. It was a spur of the moment decision. But these harpies just feel… like a proper family. Maybe after Isaac gets Ilivir his own body, he’ll find a way back here. It’s not like he has anywhere else to go. <br />
<br />
But for now, he&#39;ll just enjoy the time he has with this body and indulge himself in the pleasures of sex.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
The 1&#39;s Note: I&#39;m back! This is the first of two versions I wrote for this encounter. As far as I know, this version is not part of ChronoSeth&#39;s continuity. The reason for that is because he felt that this chapter&#39;s cheery tone was too different from what came before. He was expecting savage harpies that rape their victims to death. Not this. So I wrote up a second version of this chapter to better fit ChronoSeth&#39;s tastes. The second version is called &quot;The Value of Death&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for why I took a &quot;Monster Masume&quot; approach with the harpies, I simply was getting tired from the story&#39;s epic and serious tone so far and wanted to try something fresh and different to keep up my interest and to give myself a break before I return to a more serious tone. That and I wanted to do something different when writing a sex scene. <br />
<br />
Feel free to continue this branch if you like. I have some left over ideas for this version of the harpies. I might continue this branch if people show interest in this.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note that the chapters &quot;A Beginning to an End&quot; to &quot;Bewildering Breakfast&quot; by ChronoSeth are loosely based off a bunch of drafts (I haven&#39;t posted yet) and a story arc outline I wrote up and showed ChronoSeth and a few other writers. As a result, his chapters have a lot my own ideas in them. So just so you know, ideas such as... &quot;A thief who stole Alice&#39;s Tome&quot;, &quot;A Breakfast with Alicia&quot; and &quot;Mary&#39;s secret heritage&quot; were all ideas I came up with. I guess ChronoSeth forgot to explain that. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Welp, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!</p>
