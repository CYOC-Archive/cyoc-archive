<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>All of a sudden there was a knock at the door. Cally started to ask who it was, but before she had even 
gotten the first syllable out the door opened and in flew the blond haired girl from earlier.  "Jeez, Vick 
don't you ever knock?" Cally had responded automatically. Whether she was prompted by instinct or her Master 
PC commands she didn't know. But either way Vicky accepted it. She smiled at Cally before saying "Wellll, when 
someone is being a downer and locks herself in her room all night...." 
<br />
<p>Cally smiled at this. It did kind of sound like her. But not anymore. "I told you I'll be down in a 
second." A look from Vicky. "Promise." Cally gave her her best sincere look.
<br />
<p>"Well okay but you better not be lying or Anna and I are coming back up here to drag you downstairs." With 
this last parting shot, Vicky left the room with a flourish and one last accusing stare. Alone again Cally 
took a quick look around her room. Walking over to her computer, she made sure to password protect it before 
leaving. She was tempted to make a few more changes with the Master PC, but she stopped herself. She'd done 
all she needed to make sure she fit in. Now it was time to enjoy herself. She turned to go downstairs and join 
the party. But before she did she slipped an object into her pocket. She intended to make this a night none of 
them forgot (unless of course it went badly in which case she might need to make a run for Master PC). 
<br />
<p>Walking down the stairs, she found seven girls scattered around the living room, all of them with plastic 
cups in their hands. As she looked, she found her brain automatically connecting faces with names as the 
Master PC worked its magic on her life.
<br />
<p>First there was Vicky, the girl she'd already met. She was a bit shorter than Cally, with bright blond hair 
and a slim build. Perhaps not as voluptuous as some of the others, but very fit. Cally somehow remembered that 
she was champion swimmer. She smiled at Cally as she came down the stairs and pointed the empty seat next to 
her on the couch. Cally sat down next to her and accepted the drink when it was offered. 
<br />
<p>She sipped her drink as she continued her scan of the room. Sitting on the other side of Vicky was her best 
friend Anna. A tall leggy brunette, Cally somehow knew that the thin wireframe glasses she usually wore were 
her way of trying to keep people from only seeing her body. With her elegant legs, tanned skin and impressive 
bust, that was usually wishful thinking though. Even among this company she stood out.
<br />
<p>Then there was Sarah, standing over by the TV. That wasn't her name, but her real name was usually too 
difficult to pronounce so she'd decided to just drop it a long time ago. A wiry asian girl with sleek jet 
black hair, Sarah was short, but people said at that at their own risk. She may not have been as well endowed 
as some of the other girls, but she made up for a lot of her physical deficiencies with her atleticism.
<br />
<p>Sitting on the couch in front of Sarah were Heidi and Stephanie. Heidi was the exact opposite of Sarah. 
With her imposing 6'3" height, she would have stood out of a crowd even without her looks, which were in a 
word stunning. Her vibrant blue eyes were set in a face that looked like it could have been sculpted, framed 
by wavy golden hair on either side. That alone would have been cause envy even if that face wasn't attached to 
the most gorgeous body Cally had ever seen. All the girls in the sorority envied her, but she was too nice and 
cheerful to stay mad at for too long. 
<br />
<p>Stephanie, on the other hand, was a lively redhead with pale skin and smattering of freckles underneath 
each of her vivid green eyes. She was about average in height, with a voluptuous figure that she was very 
proud of. Perhaps she wasn't quite as toned as some of the others, but most people overlooked this since she 
carried most of that weight around her hips and on her chest.
<br />
<p>The last two girls were sitting on the floor, chatting with each other. Alexandra, or Alex as she preferred 
to be called, was a tall hispaniac beauty. Looking at her, Cally really did not see any one feature that 
seemed to set her apart. She did not have the largest bust or the widest hips of the group, and Heidi had her 
beat by several inches in height. Rather her distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that every part of her 
seemed to fit her perfectly. Legs, hips, waist, everything perfectly proportioned and balanced. 
<br />
<p>The last girl, Kelly, was barely taller than Sarah but not nearly as thin. A dancer, Kelly had shapely 
muscular legs that attached to rounded hips and a cute backside that she made sure to show off whenever she 
could. Cally knew she was a tad insecure about her looks, mostly because of her comparatively flat chest. 
Still, they were firm and perky and her grace and flexibility definitely worked to her advantage, as did her 
perfect smile and auburn hair.
<br />
<p>Her survey complete, Cally was just settling in when Vicky interrupted her thoughts.
<br />
<p>"So what was so important upstairs that you had to ditch us for so long?"
<br />
<p>Cally smiled and reached into her pocket and pulled out...</p>
