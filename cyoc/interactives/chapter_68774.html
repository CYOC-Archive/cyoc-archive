<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;First day of high-school huh? You must be nervous.&quot; Said Brads father as they were driving down the road to his new school. &quot;You know, I was just as nervous as you are when I first went to this school but look how I turned out! Just remember, If the first day of school is the worst day of school, the year can only get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know dad. Don't worry about me I'm not nervous at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing son, well here we are! Remember to call me if I'm not here to pick you up later, good luck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad walked through the school doors and decided to drink from a nearby water fountain before finding his new locker. As he was organizing his books and binders, one of the school bullies decided he wasn't standing close enough to his locker and slammed the locker door into the back of Brads head.<br />
&quot;Welcome to school new guy. You must be one of those weird anime lovers, why else would you dye your hair blue like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue? What are you talking about? I'm a blonde.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying I'm colorblind kid? You've got a locker mirror, use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
What he saw in the mirror made him jump in terror.<br />
His hair had turned blue and was retreating into his head until only a few tufts were left. He immediately noticed something else was off.His ears had grown, now being as big as his head almost. They were no longer round like they usually were, but more pointy shaped. The skin on them was red, and it seemed to be cracked on a few spots.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck...&quot; He and the bully gasped, looking at his ears, two little cuts in them, one on his lower left and one on his upper right ear. Dark blue fur tipped the edge of the back of his ears, as a lighter blue fur covered the back of the rest of them.<br />
<br />
They watched the fur spread, starting from his ears, and on his face. As he opened his mouth to say something, he noticed his teeth had got rather sharp, almost like fangs. The freakiest thing of all were his eyes, appearing larger now, and still growing, which made him look slightly...cartoony?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is....nuts...&quot; He commented as his eyes turned a deep black in color, the pupils turning white as his face started to push outwards a little bit, nose growing larger and broader, mostly light blue but darker at the top, nostrils flaring as his nose finished growing rounded. &quot;No...I couldn't be..&quot;<br />
<br />
As two antennas suddenly pushed out of his forehead, his theory was confirmed. He brought his face closer to the mirror, recognizing the cute round look of the character he was turning into.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is happening to me?&quot; He thought to himself as the fur spread to his lower jaw, turning a lighter blue as it spread down his chest, his clothes starting to tighten a little s his muscles started to grow, which he initially thought as weird, realizing what he was turning into.<br />
<br />
He eventually ended up ripping out of his shirt. Indeed, he didn't quite look like him...he was still more humanoid, and quite the muscled type now. The fur had almost covered his entire upper body now, feeling soft to the touch. As he felt it a little, he heard a weird squishing noise, just as 3 spikes seemed to grow from his back stabbing the locker right behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This just gets weirder and weirder!&quot; He said, feeling the spines. He felt a slight discomfort in his sides and looked down to see a pair of arms growing out of his sides, covered in fur and tipped with sharp claws. That brought his attention to his normal hands, and watched claws grow there as well, thick pads growing out on his palms. He looked down, finding himself able to move all 4 arms.<br />
<br />
He felt his socks and shoes growing tighter against his feet, eventually bursting under the pressure of the sudden growth. Claws were tipping his toes just like his hands...only his toes had fused into 3.<br />
<br />
He flexed them a little, feeling the undersides of his feet grow outwards into thick pads. The fur crept around his feet and legs as they bulged a little, a small tail pushing its way from the base of his spine as the fur finally made its way down his arms.<br />
<br />
The bully who had long since run away from the transforming freshman, had reported the strange occurrence to the principle who at first didn't believe the ridiculous story, until that is more and more people tried to enter the office and say the same thing.<br />
<br />
Finally, he started looking through the schools wall mounted cameras and sure enough there was Brad still as a hulking blue creature. He immediately called a hazmat team and Brad was locked away while the safety workers were trying to find out if he was infectious.<br />
<br />
The first day of school WAS the worst day for him, but could it really get better?</p>
