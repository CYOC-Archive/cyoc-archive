<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn’t a terribly long period of time at all before a strange feeling began to bubble up within Scarlett’s stomach. Regret instantly flooded her mind as the feeling grew, gaining intensity by the second. Stupid stupid stupid, it had been so bloody moronic to actually drink out of that thing. It had probably poisoned her, or given her some ancient disease, or the water had mixed with some toxic chemical that was already ripping apart her insides. All because she had to keep some dumb promise to some weird lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m uh... feeling... kinda funny,&quot; she muttered as she leaned against the counter. The strange thing was, she couldn&#39;t exactly say she felt bad. The odd shifting around in her gut, it was highly unusual, but not painful or uncomfortable. Just... unfamiliar. A completely alien sensation, though one that was starting to bring a weird sort of warmth with it.<br />
<br />
Rachel, of course, had no way of knowing this, and thus her concern remained high as she moved over to her roommate. &quot;You want me to get you anything? Or maybe call a doctor?&quot; Her hand came up to rest on Scarlett&#39;s shoulder, a comforting gesture that brought a very brief flash of a smile to her lips. <br />
<br />
In response, she shook her head slightly. &quot;Uh... no, I just... uh... don&#39;t know...&quot; The warmth was growing, and more importantly, it was spreading. She could feel it now across the whole of her torso, and it was rapidly working its way up her neck, and down her arms and legs. Averse as she normally was to heat, there wasn&#39;t anything too terribly bad about this feeling. It was almost... comforting, in a way. <br />
<br />
Her cheeks were flushed as she turned her head up, an odd smile on her face. &quot;Feels... kinda good,&quot; she muttered, drawing even more confusion out of Rachel. The blue-haired woman had pulled back, unsure of what was happening, as Scarlett found herself enjoying more and more the heat that now touched every inch of her body. It was like being dipped in a warm, soothing bath - but more than that, it was like a bath that permeated every cell of her body. <br />
<br />
By now her arms had moved from leaning against the counter to wrapping around her stomach in an odd sort of hug. Fortunate placement, given what quickly began to occur just a bit higher up her body. In her chest she could feel the warmth suddenly itensifying, growing from simple heat to a fire raging out of control. It was a blaze that demanded more room to burn, and with a great heave, her body complied. The two little mounds of flesh on her chest swelled out immediately, her bra stretching and straining to contain what rapidly became far, far more flesh than they could hope to contain.<br />
<br />
She was waiting for the sound of clothing being ripped, but it never met her ears. In fact, as she looked down at her new breathtaking bounty, arms struggling to provide some support her amazing endowments, she could no longer see the blouse she&#39;d been wearing. Instead, her clothes were rapidly changing as much as the rest of her body was, becoming white, shiny, silky to the touch. A robe draped delicately over her body, just covering up the most private areas while still showing off the rest of her.<br />
<br />
And oh, it was becoming quite the body to show off. It finally clicked as she looked down that her skin had tanned, its previously pale tone replaced with an olive-colored hue that pleasantly contrasted with her new garment. She looked down further just as the fire spread to her lower body; instantly she could feel the same swelling that had graced her breasts burning in her hips and her rear, pushing them out to be far, far more impressive than before. She could feel the robe curling around her new curves as her legs stretched out, adding just a dash of new height.<br />
<br />
Her now-delicate hands moved up to her face as she felt the fire spread there, massaging out her features. The changes were more subtle in that region, a tug here and a smoothing there, but somehow, she was certain that improvements were being made. A more scuplted, beautiful face was what she imagined as she traced her hands over her shifting features, linging for a moment on her smoothed jawline and plumped lips. Sloly her hands moved back to her hair, pulling it forward to find that the light brown color had brightened, the silky strands now ever more inviting as they fell down far enough to tickle her widened rear.<br />
<br />
It was the final change, however, that proved most dramatic. One last burst of pressure in her back, like something being forced out. For a moment she worried that some painful change might occur, but these fears proved unfounded as she felt the pressure relieved with an emergence of two massive additions. A pair of wings, decorated in beautiful white features, burst from her back, her robe shifting to accomodate their presence. She had to back out of the kitchen and into the living room just to get space for them to extend fully - but even her stumbling seemed graceful, as if her every movement was an effortless display of art in motion.<br />
<br />
The surging fires had begun to abate now, but the warmth remained as she was finally able to take it all in. She breathed heavily, a smile still wide in her face. Any understanding of what had just occurred was secondary to how simply wonderful it felt. Every fiber of her altered being was dipped in pure bliss, comfort like she&#39;d never known before. She stood up straight, now easily a foot taller than she&#39;d been before, iridescent green eyes now filled with confidence as they fell onto her roommate. No hint of anxiety or worry bothered Scarlett; she couldn&#39;t recall a time in her life where she&#39;d been able to say that, nor could she imagine going back to being plagued by doubt or insecurity.<br />
<br />
Rachel, having been able to do little but stare in amazement, had her jaw hanging low as she slowly approached her transformed roommate. She struggled just to get out once sentence, eyes wide and hands clutched together at her chest. Somehow, Scarlett was sure that she could identity every emotion pouring off of the artistic woman right now. Confusion, anxiety, fear, concern... and something a bit more excited mixed in with it all. &quot;S-Scarlett?&quot; she stammered nervously, &quot;W-w-what... what happened...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she replied, her voice now carrying with it a calm, carefree undertone. &quot;But I love it.&quot;</p>
