<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon after going home, Neil considered the possibilities in hiring Bradley to help them reach the next level in their workouts. Neil was surprisingly pretty good at leading the way through for Max, but there were limits to what he was capable of. As far as he knew, after all, he was not a personal trainer. Still, even as they went home, Neil thought about the incidents and events at the gym. While it seemed like Max was unaffected, the fact was he had engaged in some rather unusual fantasies. Neil was usually straight - focused entirely on the opposite sex and more to the point his lack of luck with the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
But something definitely seemed different today. Well, more different than usual. He knew going in that it seemed there was something mystical or abnormal about that gym. It seemed to have this effect on people. Pumping their muscles up, accentuating their best features, or developing them in ways that they wanted. Or in ways they were attached to, for one reason or another. Neil wondered if this might be somehow connected to the changes underway due to the gym.<br />
<br />
He had gained an astronomical and extensive leg up versus the other guys with his membership there - and the corresponding benefits from the magical effect. And he knew Max now was likewise. Both knew going in that they were going to leave more ripped and muscular than they were when they went in. But the question was - were there side effects now that Neil had not quite considered...? Few things came in this life without giving something.<br />
<br />
Law of equal exchange and what not. Neil knew it well enough. To gain something, there was usually something that needed to be given. Time, money, some service, or something else. And going by what seemed to be happening...could this be some sort of result that was either inadvertent or, worse, planned? It seemed to be something he hardly even noticed until there he was, offhandedly thinking in a fantasy about Bradley like that.<br />
<br />
Yet today, he was fantasizing somewhat oddly about engaging in some kind of sexual activity - with a guy. With Bradley. The personal trainer seemed to be...unaffected he guessed, but he had no way of really knowing. From what he heard down the line of rumors, Bradley was still a total lover for those young women who went to him for a certain kind of fitness training. They chose him because they knew he was open to that.<br />
<br />
What made Neil worry about this sexuality effect was he had no idea where it came from. Maybe...maybe it was just his eyes wavering, considering some possibilities. <br />
<br />
After all, college was the time when people experimented, wasn&#39;t it? And he didn&#39;t even have to outright experiment. His interest was still in Sandra, and more to the point getting a date with her. Even if he thought about it, it didn&#39;t mean he&#39;d pursue the idea. He just...considered what it might be like.<br />
<br />
Though it seemed like he was far from the only one there that had the same idea. Those two men outright making out like that, and how curious Neil felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You thinking about something, Neil?&quot; Max asked. Max was completely spared the effect it seemed. He was just about the same as he always was. But now, eager, more fitness oriented, more driven and strong and forward bound. Neil knew he was going to need to watch Max for any hint of a similar effect. Maybe he&#39;d need to pay attention more to the way things were. Examine some of the people who went to 20 Fitness more in detail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just...pondering about what Bradley told us.&quot; People-Watching was never really his forte, but now he was going to need to do so in order to get more of a handle for whatever this was going on. He figured he could start with Bradley. Maybe it wasn&#39;t smart to go with the guy he had such a vivid reaction to. But he wanted to figure out if the mental effects were hitting the trainer now too.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna hire him for some workouts?&quot; Max said in a somewhat naive fashion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah,&quot; Neil nodded, deciding for now he wouldn&#39;t share his decision to observe and quantify with Max, &quot;We&#39;re doing pretty well, but I figure we can always use a pro like Brad&#39;s help. He knows a lot more about this kind of thing than we do.&quot; So far, at least. Neil for now looked like a male model. A muscular, etched stud. But he wanted even more than that. He wanted to be big, buff and on the level of a bodybuilder like Bradley.<br />
<br />
Then Sandra would surely notice him. And so would so many other women.<br />
<br />
Going ahead with Max&#39;s blessing, they pooled their money to get sessions with Brad per his workout deal he had mentioned. They&#39;d have more than enough to workout with Brad regularly. Neil wondered if he should try and get a job as a male model. Could be fun  - and help them pay for some more sessions. After they got that taken care of, Neil went ahead and called Brad up;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bradley here, with 20 Fitness. I&#39;ve got a new promotional deal - half off for personal training to get you in the best shape of your life.&quot; He led of course with the pitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brad, it&#39;s Neil and Max. We&#39;re looking to get the deal, and start working with you. Can we get a session in soon?&quot; Neil admittedly felt kind of excited talking with Brad like this. Soon, Neil would be able to workout with Brad, and they&#39;d go to the gym, sweat it up, and then hit the showers, where they could compare their muscles and cocks---woah. Dial down the libido, Neil told himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, great! I saw you guys today and, as buff as you guys are looking, you could do with some leadership and direction from a guy like me,&quot; Brad stated, &quot;Trust me, if I work with you guys we can get things moving along posthaste. You guys will be putting on muscle like no tomorrow, and looking sexy for the ladies on the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that sounds more than agreeable.&quot; Neil nodded along. So far nothing like what Neil experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, just shoot me the info and account stuff, and I&#39;ll get you guys in for an early morning workout tomorrow.&quot; And so it was set.<br />
<br />
Neil gave Brad the bank info and such, and before long it was okayed to get a workout in the next day. Neil wondered if the next day things would be even more different. Considering what had happened this day, he wouldn&#39;t be surprised. He&#39;d need to watch for Brad and any further changes - as well as for anything happening with the guys from school.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to just roll over for whatever was happening, but first he needed to understand to a degree what was going on...and that was when a knock came at the door to their dorm room. Neil pondered who it might be...though it might just be someone going for the wrong door.</p>
