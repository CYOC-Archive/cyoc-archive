<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will sat there going over what he could do to test this infernal machine. He reviewed a few options and came to the 'Animal Transformations' setting. Clicking it he multiple branches popped up, Will went over the type of transformations, one catching his eye was a Domestic Cat. &quot;Why not, it couldn't hurt anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selecting himself in front of the computer it read off his information. Bower, William. Age: 27, Height: 5'11&quot;, Weight: 180. After a few moments of tinkering he adjusted the program to his specifications. He wanted to be turned into a cat (this is assuming it's possible), young, with gray fur. The next thing he had to adjust was the reality settings. He made sure that everyone but himself was unaware of his transformation, this way no one could gain anything whilst he was a cat.<br />
<br />
The final adjustments were made and he set the timer for a 24 hour period, this way he could become human once more but get the experience of being a cat. Will set the instinct settings to fifty percent of normal and memories to full. &quot;That should just about do it, now lets get this pathetic attempt at a joke started.&quot; Will punched in the begin sequence.<br />
<br />
Chronivac program initiated...<br />
Time to Completion: 1:58 seconds<br />
<br />
For a few moments there was nothing, a slight tingling sensation maybe. That's when a fiery feeling spread throughout his entire body, the hair on his arms changed in color, covering most of his body in a matter of seconds. He stood suddenly, out of fear, he hadn't really expected the program to work. Backing up slowly he looked at his hand which was now completely covered in fur. &quot;This is inten...&quot; His voice suddenly quipped as the fur moved up his neck and to his face.<br />
<br />
The palms of his hands suddenly blossomed rough pads, which covered a good portion of it, at the same time his hands/paws began to shrink as his fingers grew nubby at best turning completely into paws. He immediately ripped his clothes off as best he could with paws, to get a better view of the entire transformation. He felt something hitting the side of his leg as he stood there, looking behind himself, Will saw a fur covered tail hitting his legs.<br />
<br />
Looking to his feet, Will could see that they had basically undergone the same transformation as his hands, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to walk on them. His ankles started to ride up his leg, causing him to launch forward, landing on his forepaws with a slight groan of pain. The fur had completely covered Will's body, and had stopped for the most part, but the changes were far from being over. <br />
<br />
A slight sensation of fear spread through Will's mind as his spine adjusted in several ways, accommodating a new way of walking, on all fours. The changes spread to his face which started to compress into a feline fashion, his nose becoming very tiny as whiskers grew from either side of his face. His ears came to a point and rose to the top of his head. Looking to the desk where the Chronivac was he could see that it was growing at an amazing rate, or rather he was shrinking. A second later, he was the size of a normal house cat.<br />
<br />
Will shook his head, standing up, thankfully thanks to the instincts level he was able to walk on all fours with little trouble. He looked around, everything was so much larger, his perspective had changed a great deal. The thought excited him, it actually worked, and in twenty-four hours he'd be able to try something else. Jumping (which was incredibly easy for him) up to the chair, he looked over the computer. ~Good, I can still read, don't want to be stuck as a stupid animal for a day.~<br />
<br />
The computer spoke once more. &quot;Final Sequence beginning, reality shift in progress.&quot; As the computer spoke the final word, the room shifted completely. When it came back into focus, Will saw that he was sitting on a couch, not the one in his living room or anywhere in the manor for that matter. However, the surroundings seemed familiar, like he'd seen it once before. Jumping off the couch, Will walked around, trying to understand what had happened. ~Maybe because Will, the human me, isn't supposed to exist, then I shouldn't be at the manor...makes sense.~<br />
<br />
After a few moments of familiarizing himself with the surroundings (as well as himself) it dawned on him why he remembered this place. This was Megan's apartment, before they moved in together. It made sense that without him, she'd still be living here and not at the manor. ~Dammit, why her though? Maybe the Chronivac decided to put me in a place where I knew the person.~ Whatever the terms were he didn't exactly like them.<br />
<br />
Laying down, Will decided that there was nothing much he could do at this point but wait and see what happens. After about an hour he heard the door knob turned, sometimes it helps to have excellent hearing. Standing up, Will's tail began to wag, swaying back and forth slightly. <br />
<br />
Megan opened the door, a smile on her face as she saw her little tomcat boy standing there waiting for her. &quot;Looks like someone was waiting for mommy to get home.&quot; She closed the door behind her, picking Will up and cradling him in her arms. &quot;My little baby Will, you seem happy today.&quot; She said in response to his purring.<br />
<br />
Will was surprised that he was called by his proper name, but couldn't help but feel more than comfortable in her arms as she pet him. She set him down on the counter as she went off to change out of her work clothes. When she came back she was in nothing more than panties and a bra, Will had always admired her beauty, and the fact that she knew that she was beautiful but wasn't conceited about it. Picking him up once more, she held him against her breasts. Will, still having a human mind, didn't mind that very much.<br />
<br />
Laying on the couch, Megan covered up with a blanket and laid Will on top of her. After a few moments, she was fast asleep. Thoughts ran through Will's head. ~If the Chronivac isn't here, will I be able to turn back to normal?~</p>
