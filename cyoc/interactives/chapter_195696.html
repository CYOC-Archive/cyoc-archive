<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the beachside unit Maureen had just put on the charcoal dress. It felt really short and was intended that the wearer wore it without a bra. With her normally massive boobs Maureen had not gone without a bra since .... probably since she had been a teenager previously which was 30 years ago. It seemed amazing to have breasts that stayed perky without support but to Maureen&#39;s pleasure that was what she now possessed.<br />
<br />
She had sent the message to Liz so that Liz would not be alarmed if she did not turn up the minute Roger left for work in the morning. She got a reply quite quickly &#39;That&#39;s fine. Did you get my message about Spain. I hope it&#39;s okay as its too late to pull out now. Booked and deposit paid&#39; That text made no sense to Maureen at all, until she listened to the original phone message which Maureen had been oblivious of. <br />
<br />
The idea of a Spanish holiday appealed. It lifted her spirits even further. She immediately texted back “Sounds fantastic! I’m in” <br />
<br />
Charlotte had come back from parking the Mazda and excited that her new friend would be joining them in clubbing had offered that Claire could do her make-up. It turned out that Claire was a beautician and only there as she was Mason’s girlfriend. They were sharing a double bed in the girl’s unit. <br />
<br />
She was also able to borrow some heels from Claire who shared her shoe size and a necklace from Charlotte. She was finally ready for a night with her new friends.<br />
…………..<br />
Paul and Ginny turned up exactly when expected and Liz was thrilled when Roger led her by the hand to the backseat of Paul’s BMW which he opened for her.<br />
<br />
They had dinner at a restaurant near the theatre and Liz enjoyed some champagne. She had no trouble joining in the conversation and was very pleased when Ginny observed “I see you have lost weight. You are looking the best I have seen you in years. What diet are you on?”<br />
<br />
“A special diet I was introduced to by my friend Liz. It’s really working well. It’s helping my complexion as well. My skin is softer and just feels younger” Liz thought to explain ahead of time that Maureen would look even younger and slimmer in the near future.<br />
<br />
‘You might have to share your secrets with me. I’m impressed”<br />
<br />
“Just wait and see if I can keep the weight off. You know my record is not good”<br />
<br />
“How is you friend Liz? Has she found someone yet?”<br />
<br />
Liz didn’t know how to reply “She’s fine. She proven to be the best friend a woman could have. She’s going to come with us to Spain. Oh, that’s our big news. I haven’t told you yet. We only booked today. We are off to Spain in August.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the evening was spent discussing the upcoming Spanish holiday. Ginny recommended that they should also visit Portugal since they would be so close. Ginny and Roger had holidayed over there 5 year&#39;s earlier.<br />
<br />
After dinner they attended the theatre and to Liz’s delight Roger held her hand only removing it when he needed to clap. During the interval they were offered another glass of champagne each. Liz accepted and even drank Paul’s glass as Paul needed to drive. It was 11.30 by the time they arrived back home. <br />
<br />
Liz changed into the nightgown that Maureen had instructed her to wear. It felt horribly frumpish to Liz but she obeyed. When alone in the house she had gone through Maureen’s wardrobe looking for nicer nightwear. There was none to be found. Liz guessed the nightgown was designed to keep Roger away and decided Maureen must have hidden all her sexy negligee. <br />
<br />
She found Roger already in bed when she returned from the ensuite. She crawled under the blankets on Maureen’s side. She desperately wanted to cuddle her bed companion but restrained herself. Maureen had given her permission to sleep with Roger but not to make love to him. Surely a cuddle wouldn’t hurt? She resisted but could not get thoughts of Roger out of her mind.<br />
<br />
Beside her Roger was pretending to be asleep. Maureen had dressed really sexy tonight and he hoped he was in with a chance. He waited for her to make the first move. She would always indicated when he had her permission to make love. Last night she had been quite demanding and had pulled Roger onto herself the minute she crawled into bed. He was hoping the same thing would happen again and had even taken a pill so that he would not disappoint her. <br />
<br />
He could not believe that it was only 48 hours since he had made love to Liz. It was a dream come true. Then the behaviour of Maureen in the last 48 hours was also mind blowing. Him making love to Liz seemed to have unleashed the harlot in Maureen. He liked that a lot. She had clearly dressed to please him tonight. Until recently she had been so prudish in bed. Thanks to the pill he had taken he was already hard. It was very hard to wait.</p>
