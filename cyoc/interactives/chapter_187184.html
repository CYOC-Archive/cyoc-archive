<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had no idea how this had happened. I mean, I did have an idea, I just didn&#39;t comprehend it. It was clear that last night&#39;s accident had given me the chance to see this weird Sims like HUD. At first I was scared, then I was skeptical about it thinking that I was most likely loosing my mind. However, as I went to have breakfast, I started fidgeting with the options this weird system granted. <br />
<br />
One of them showed me how much money the household was supposed to have. Since I lived on my own and had a full time job, I always knew how much money I had on my bank, yet, when I saw the number, I couldn&#39;t help myself but to double check with my phone as I realized the numbers matched exactly. <br />
<br />
Then, testing things, I thought &quot;what happens if just change the number and add a zero?&quot;. After lingering for a second, I went for it and added a zero, changing the 200 bucks and change I had saved into 2000. After saving my changes I quickly went to my phone and reloaded the whole thing. I felt like it took ages for the page to load but eventually it did. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes as I noticed how the number was just there. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna change my life&quot; I thought as I held my hand against my barely-screaming mouth. For the longest time I had been living alone in this small, dark, and damp apartment that you could only get into through a sketchy alley, but this was my opportunity to succeed in life. I didn&#39;t have to work anymore as some low-paid waiter at a bar, not when I could just keep on adding zeros to my money and change my life for the better.<br />
<br />
That was when it struck me though, &quot;what else can I change then?&quot;. Apparently I had an option to change the color of my furniture to which, to my delight and horror, just changed immediately in the blink of an eye when I tried it on my sofa. It seemed I could do a lot of changes to my place, but then my eyes lingered on the &#39;Household members&#39; option. I was only able to see an icon depicting my ugly face, but then I noticed the &quot; + &quot; sign right next to it. In so far, the system had been working just like in The Sims when you were on full edit mode and high on cheats, but it was basically the same. Thus, I chose the option wondering if I could just... add people to live with me? That would be weird, but I had been alone for the longest time and I just wanted to test the waters.<br />
<br />
When I chose the option, a new menu appeared in front of my eyes. While there was an option to, basically, create someone out of nowhere? it was grayed out, so basic gaming instincts told me I couldn&#39;t really choose that option as of yet. However, there was the option of &quot;editing existing people&quot; that I could use. Curiosity dragged me to choose it and, when I did, the window showed a bird view of the floor of my apartment complex, showing a bunch of figures moving around.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I saw myself and my tiny place in the corner of the building. I could see myself in the kitchen just staring into space. It was so weird. Yet, before I could focus on seeing a double of myself, a motion cought my eye. My neighbour, Jake, was coming up the stairs and into the hallway, probably coming home from his early work-out routine. The guy was big and I could only guess he was around his 30s or something. I knew he went to the local gym fairly often and that he had a crappy job. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t be living here.<br />
<br />
When I clicked on him, a new window opened up showing me a full picture of him as he was standing, wearing the exact same clothes and looking relaxed. Just like in The Sims, the left side showed me personality traits and talents, whereas the right side showed me his clothing tendencies for different ocassions. Down below, however, I was able to see more detailed information about him, like his full name and such. <br />
<br />
The guy was so dam hot, so athletic and big, though I couldn&#39;t say for sure how big, as I didn&#39;t know how to compare myself or anything. As I was fiddling with the system, I realized that time seemed to have stopped outside. Like, every single figure I had seen moving around on the apartment complex was now completly freezed. When I closed Jake&#39;s window everything went back to normal and I was able to see him walking again, now my ears catching his footsteps outside in the hallway. I didn&#39;t let him reach his door before I opened it again and went to check the options one more time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, is this what I think it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
I told myself as I checked the &quot;relationship&quot; label. With a thought, I opened it and a list appeared in front of my eyes. The list of options that I had wasn&#39;t very long, but there was one that caught my eye. Gulping, I chose it and applied the changes right away, thinking it was impossible.  I was about to just stick to adding zeros to my bank account when suddently I heard the fumbling of keys outside my door. The walls were thin, so I clearly heard as a key got into my locked door, got into place and opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning son, went to sleep late last night?&quot; Said Jake as he waltzed into my place and put down his duffle bag down, clearly with his dirty clothes from the gym and the rest of his gear. I never had the chance to see him so upclose, always in passing and from afar when he was already at the other end of the hallway, but now I could truly see the man. He was about 6&#39;2 and had a great muscly build. Nothing over the top, but clearly a figure that could only be the result of some training. He had brown eyes and hair, which he kept short. He also had an unkept beard, and his clothes showed he was probably in a similar economic situation as me.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah... hi dad?&quot; I answered back, tone showing my confusion but also my excitement. I couldn&#39;t believe I had a dad now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; He asked as he approached to me, a show of concern in his eyes as he looked down to my eyes. I was only 5&#39;7, so the difference in height was noticeable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, just a slight headache&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, why don&#39;t you go lay down? I&#39;ll make breakfast in a minute. You&#39;ve been working hard this week.&quot; He said as he suddently approached me and gave me a tight hug. The man couldn&#39;t be more than 10 years older than me, but that didn&#39;t stop him at all from seeing me as his loved son. He even kissed me in my forehead before pushing me into my room. His lovely pecs and hard muscles had felt nice, but the sensation lasted only too little. <br />
<br />
As I went back to bed, dawning on the idea that suddently I had a hot daddy, I couldn&#39;t help but think on how many things I wanted to change. Luckly, I had the system to help me make all my dreams come true.</p>
