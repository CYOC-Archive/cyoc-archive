<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff found himself in darkness. He couldn't tell whether this meant he'd lost all his senses, or if he was in <br />
some dark enclosure. The fact he was still sentient and could tell it was dark made him think it was the <br />
latter. He hoped it wasn't someone's pocket, though judging by the lack of movement, he was in some sort of <br />
cupboard or drawer. After what felt like hours, he finally saw a crack of light as whatever he was in shook <br />
about. A giant face glared down at him, a young man in his mid twenties, with a shaggy mane of hair and an <br />
unshaven face. He put a huge hand into the container and Jeff felt himself moved as the man shoved him aside <br />
to pick up a pen. The place shook again as the giant closed Jeff's chamber, sending him back into darkness.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months, Jeff came to learn he was in the bedroom cabinet of a guy called Matt Kantle, who <br />
lived in New York and worked as a waiter in some posh sounding restaurant. Matt would occasionally open the <br />
drawer to grab something, and Jeff always had a glimmer of hope that it would be him, yet it was always <br />
something else, the movement causing him to be buried further under the pile of stationary and books kept with <br />
him. The thought of being wrapped around another man's penis didn't originally excite Jeff, but that moment of <br />
action would be much better than spending days, sometimes weeks in darkness. The longer he stayed inside, the <br />
more he desired to be used. At this rate, he would even accept Matt using him for some sloppy masturbation <br />
session before being unceremoniously dumped in the trash. He just wanted to experience being a condom at least <br />
once before the time was up and he was turned back into a human. He didn't have a concept of time inside the <br />
dark drawer. He could of been in there a few weeks, or he could be near the end of his change. When using the <br />
Chronivac, he didn't even consider how boring and lonely it would be as an inanimate object.  His thoughts <br />
would occasionally turn to his friends and family. The Chronivac would of made everyone unaware of his changes <br />
and thus to the rest of the world, Jeff the human never actually existed. He felt a twinge of sadness at this, <br />
but would forget about it the moment the light appeared again. He was Jeff the condom now, and would be until <br />
his 4 years were up.<br />
<br />
The drawer opened again and Jeff was surprised to see a different person opening it. He was a handsome man, <br />
probably early thirties, with a strong jaw and gelled hair. Slight crows feet edged his eyes while stray grey <br />
hairs dotted his temples. Jeff hoped it wasn't a burglar, he hadn't seen Matt's face in what he assumed was a <br />
few days now. But then he noticed the man was shirtless, relatively slim and muscular, a light coating of hair <br />
swirled around his pecs. He had stuffed a hand into the drawer and was moving things about. The man's eyebrows <br />
lowered in frustration and he called out &quot;I can't see it in here, are you sure you still have one?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I saw it in there a couple of weeks back. Check under the Chinese menu&quot; Matt's unmistakable voice <br />
yelled back to him.<br />
<br />
The man moved a parchment and his eyes lit up. &quot;Ah, found it!&quot;. His hand reached down and surrounded Jeff. If <br />
he still had a heart, it would be beating out of his chest. He felt the warm, clammy hand crush his delicate <br />
body as he was pulled out of his prison. He was held under the room light and the man read his wrapper. He <br />
looked a bit concerned and yelled out to Matt again &quot;Honey, I don't think this will be big enough&quot;. Jeff felt <br />
offended, of course he was big enough. He'd be able to fit around this overconfident bastard's cock any day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? I thought it was the same type you used last time.&quot; Matt called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I need XXL unless you want a mess on your hands&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Jack but unless you want to head into town to get another pack, I haven't got any more left in the <br />
house. It'll have to do unless you want to leave it tonight&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jack sighed and started to unwrap the condom. Jeff couldn't believe it, he was finally going to be used! His <br />
foil coating was thrown away and Jack took off his underwear. Jeff was shocked at the man's size. He really <br />
wasn't exaggerating. Jeff began to think that maybe he was too small for him. It was a monster of a cock, and <br />
it wasn't even fully erect. Matt came back into the room and Jack put Jeff on the bedside table. He couldn't <br />
see what was going on from his position, but he guessed they were doing some foreplay before the main event. <br />
Finally, Jeff felt those fingers grasp him again and he flew over to Jack's now solid cock. Jack placed Jeff's <br />
tip over his cock and pulled down, unravelling his body along the long snake. Jeff couldn't exactly place the <br />
feeling he felt as his body filled up with the meat, but he could equate it to being similar to having eaten <br />
tons of food, an overstuffed, bloated feeling that worsened the more he was rolled down. The man's cock was <br />
truly a challenge, and Jeff hugged it tightly, his latex form feeling stretched over it. He was barely able to <br />
contain the mass, and Jeff thought if it were any bigger then he might break.<br />
<br />
Jack pulled down on the condom until he was satisfied with how much it covered him. It was smaller than he was <br />
used to and felt a tad tight to him. But it was all they had, and he was too horny to let a small condom get <br />
in the way of him and Matt having sex. Matt was already in position on the end of the bed, ready to be totally <br />
thrashed by his pride and joy.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a slight coldness as Jack rubbed some lube up and down him, the motion causing the man to twitch <br />
inside of him. He knew what was about to come and the full impact of what was to happen suddenly hit him. He <br />
was really going to be used as a condom, to be filled with another man's cum. But it was too late to worry <br />
about that as Matt's round ass came into view, and Jeff braced for impact. Jack spread Matt's butt cheeks and <br />
jammed his cock inside, going slowly at first to let the man get used to his size. Jeff felt an odd arousal as <br />
the dark fleshy tunnel surrounded him, a few drops of pre-cum soaking his inside. It was slow moving at first <br />
but Jack's thrusts got quicker the more Matt grew accustomed to him. The rapid movement and friction led to an <br />
intense pleasure throughout Jeff's form. He'd never felt such a sexual thrill before and his thoughts dulled <br />
as the pleasure took over.<br />
<br />
A twitching within himself brought Jeff back to his senses as Jack tensed up, and he realised this was the <br />
moment he was made for. Thick globs of cum squirted out and hit Jeff's tip, the amount causing him to stretch <br />
and expand further. He was already stretched tight over the man's massive meat, yet this ejaculation was <br />
pushing him to his limits. Another jet of cum stretched him out even further. He couldn't take it any more, he <br />
felt like he could explode at any moment. A final thrust and another load came out of the man's cock. Jeff <br />
found he was too small to handle his load as he felt something within him break. The tip of the condom ripped <br />
in half, bits of torn latex mixing with the flow of cum that poured out from his damaged body. Jeff couldn't <br />
believe it, his mind felt scattered and torn. He hoped the worst hadn't happened, but he just knew he was <br />
broken. Jack pulled his cock out and gasped at the scrap of latex still tightly wrapped around it. The top had <br />
exploded, cum dripped from the remains left on him while more cum and small bits of the ripped condom was <br />
starting to run out of Matt's ass. &quot;Oh my god, I told you it was too small!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt leant around and saw the pitiful excuse for a condom that had torn inside his ass. He could feel the <br />
man's cum slowly dripping out of him. &quot;Shit! I can't believe this happened! I told you to get those condoms <br />
the last time we were out!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't pin the blame on me, you were the one who said it'd have to do!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you didn't want to wait until tomorrow! But no, you just had to have sex tonight. When was the last time <br />
you were tested anyway?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last time you were because we went together. And we were both clear, remember?&quot;.<br />
<br />
While the two men bickered over whose fault it was, Jeff was having a panic attack. He had ripped. He was a <br />
broken condom. He could still feel parts of him inside Matt's ass and it was messing with his mind being in <br />
multiple places at once. He tried to think about what the Chronivac said. There was some sort of warning. His <br />
heart sank as he remembered what it said. If the user was broken and rendered unusable, the Chronivac might <br />
not be able to turn him back to normal. He'd just exploded inside a man's anus, there was no way he'd be able <br />
to be fixed after that. He could be stuck as a piece of latex for the rest of his life! Would he still be <br />
conscious after time was up and the Chronivac couldn't turn him human? It was hard enough waiting to be used <br />
inside that drawer, how would he survive years in a landfill without being able to do anything but think? How <br />
long did it take latex to decompose? His worried thoughts were interrupted as he felt some movement. Jack <br />
yanked on his shredded body just a bit too hard. Jeff fretted as he ripped even further, breaking into two <br />
pieces with a snap. The man muttered about how cheap the condom was and walked over to a trash can. Jeff <br />
caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, pieces of ripped, transparent latex, jagged sides, small holes and <br />
stretch marks scarred his torn bodies. He was in despair as the man rolled him into a ball and dropped him <br />
into the trash can. He was surrounded by used tissues, candy wrappers, and other items just as disposable as <br />
he was.</p>
