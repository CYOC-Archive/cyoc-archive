<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty knew he didn&#39;t really need money to get the clothes he wanted, he just needed to think and he would have all the clothes he ever wished for, but that sort of took away the fun. He really wanted to do things he had never been able to do before, so now he was going to slowly enjoy his amazing powers.<br />
<br />
As Ty started walking along the mall, he realized he was much taller than most people. Everyone kept on staring at him or giving him a double take as his bulky frame walked into one of the most expensive stores he could find. Inside, he was greeted by a young guy who probably was on his early 20s. His name tag read &#39;Hunter&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, welcome! Is there anything I can help you with?&quot; Said Hunter the second Ty walked in. It didn&#39;t take a mind reader to know that Hunter&#39;s attitude wasn&#39;t just based on professionalism, however, Ty decided to read his mind anyway, just to be sure. Turns out Ty was right, Hunter had the hots for him but was too embarrassed to do anything but his job. All Hunter could hope for was that he would do a very good job with the stud he had in front of him and that he could be memorable enough for Ty to comeback one day.<br />
<br />
Ty, in return just smiled at him and replied &quot;just browsing, thanks&quot; and walked into the store to check out the different outfits. Despite the fact that he just dismissed the clerk, he really felt flattered, as this was the first time something like this happened to him. In turn, he decided he would make Hunter&#39;s day by asking him for help anyway. &quot;Hmm, what do I need first? And what should I ask of him to leave a deep impression?&quot; Thought Ty as he approached once again with a bit of a clueless face to Hunter. <br />
<br />
He decided it would be just easier to know what Hunter was into, and then go from there. Ty was never into any kind of fetish before, but his new power was giving him an internal confidence he found extremely hot. Once he read Hunter&#39;s mind, he knew what to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so I&#39;m in the middle of a growth spurt and I kinda need some new shoes cuz this are feeling kinda tight. I don&#39;t know my right size, so, think you can help me out?&quot; Asked Ty as he scratched the back of his neck on purpose, letting his right bicep constrain against his T-shirt. Inmediatly, Hunter asked him to take a sit while he went out to look for the measuring gadget. Ty was still young and felt a bit embarrassed for doing what he was going to do, so he just made everyone in the big fancy store leave. He was now left alone with Hunter.<br />
<br />
When Hunter came back, Ty was sitting in the fancy couch with his long and thick legs spread wide. &quot;Here we are then&quot; said Hunter with a little shy smile. &quot;Could you please take your shoe off?&quot; Asked Hunter as he got on his knees in front of Ty. Ty didn&#39;t answer, he just raised an eyebrow and forced Hunter to take the hint with his power. Hunter, being an average guy, only 5&#39;8 and thin, only gulped at the idea that came to his mind. Ty, on the other hand, was kinda enjoying how powerful he felt. He liked to see Hunter on his knees, but he wanted to move along, so he just lifted his right foot right in front of Hunter&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Hunter didn&#39;t hesitate for long and just started untidying Ty&#39;s shoe. Ty decided to make the smell of his feet very manly and strong, so when Hunter took off Ty&#39;s shoe, he inmediatly gasped and felt his whole body tremble as Ty&#39;s musk intoxicated him. &quot;Everything okay down there?&quot; Asked Ty, which made Hunter wake up from his dream. Ty&#39;s feet looked massive in Hunter&#39;s hands, he just wanted to take a whif and smell them more, but he knew that was out of the question, anything that could insult this stud wasn&#39;t in his plans, so he replied with a short &#39;of course&#39; and continued. He was about to put Ty&#39;s foot on the device, when Ty interrupted him &quot;Take my sock out too, just to be precise&quot;. Hunter gulped again, his cock was rock hard already but he was doing everything in his power to hide it in between his thighs.<br />
<br />
Hunter did as he was told and reached for the white sock that started a few inches above Ty&#39;s leg. With delicate movements, Hunter removed Ty&#39;s sock past his heel and then completely off. When Ty&#39;s sock was completely off, he stretched his leg and wiggled his toes with a little smile on his face. &quot;Ahhh, that feels so nice&quot; He said right before he planted his whole foot on Hunter&#39;s face. &quot;See how big it is? It&#39;s bigger than your head, so I guess I&#39;m past size 12 already&quot; Commented Ty in a very nonchalant way, as if he wasn&#39;t rubbig his big ass foot against the smaller man. <br />
<br />
Hunter could only try to maintain balance as he was pushed back by the foot slap he was getting. It was very difficult but he was able to avoid falling down as he unconciously thrusted his face forward, inhaling as much of Ty&#39;s essence as possible. The encounter only lasted less than 5 seconds, but Ty&#39;s manly smell was so strong and overpowering that Hunter came inside his pants almost immediately. Ty made sure Hunter didn&#39;t realize that he just had wet his pants with his semen and made him continue with the procedure as if nothing had happened. &quot;Your feet are very big, and probably the widest feet I&#39;ve ever seen&quot; replied Hunter without realizing he was massaging Ty&#39;s foot.<br />
<br />
Ty was enjoying the experience of having someone worship his feet as it was second nature, but he was still new to all this so he decided to move along, not without leaving a mental note of trying something similar in the future, he really liked the fact he could make someone his slave if he just so wished. Ty removed his right foot from Hunter&#39;s hands and put it on the shoe sizer. &quot;How is it looking?&quot; Asked Ty as Hunter approached his face a little bit too close to Ty&#39;s foot while trying to measure it. &quot;Oh my god, it&#39;s 12 1/2 inches! You are a size 16 kid, wide&quot; Said Hunter without taking his eyes off the big foot. <br />
<br />
Ty loved being so much bigger than Hunter, but he didn&#39;t like being called a kid. Unfortunately, he did look very young and said he was in the middle of a growth spurt. He didn&#39;t mean it quite so literally at first, but now it dawned on him he still had a baby face. He thought on changing his physical appereance immediatly, but decided on not doing anything yet. He could always stop time or make himself younger however he wanted, there was no rush. &quot;Say, why don&#39;t you bring me those shoes on my size, those too, and I would like to see some of your dress shoes too&quot; Said Ty while taking his second shoe off.<br />
<br />
Hunter was still hard, but he didn&#39;t he was and just replied &quot;I&#39;m sorry but we don&#39;t carry anything bigger than a 14&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just go check in the back? For me? Maybe you&#39;ll find something&quot; Said Ty as he made every single shoe they had to grow into his foot size.<br />
<br />
Hunter wasn&#39;t going to argue or anything, he would have to be crazy for that, so he quickly stood up and ran to the back of the store, his 5 inch dick pressed hard against his slacks. Minutes later, he came back with a massive stack of shoe boxes which he almost couldn&#39;t keep in balance. The only reason why he didn&#39;t fall was because Ty helped him out, he was feeling great for being so nice to him.  <br />
<br />
Ty made Hunter put him every single pair of shoes and, whenever Ty couldn&#39;t decide, he would have Hunter hold both of his feet while massaging them. In the end, Ty bought 12 pairs of shoes, including dress shoes, and 3 pairs of sandals which Hunter couldn&#39;t help but compliment over and over. Ty spent well over $100.000 on shoes alone. <br />
<br />
After his purchases, he decided to wear a pair of flip flops he had bought, he wanted everyone to acknowledge his big feet. &quot;Hey, how about you keep my old shoes?&quot; Said Ty as he gave them to Hunter, making sure to empower the musky scent until it was so strong it could make a whole house smell like his feet. Hunter took them with glee, his knees weak at the manly smell of such an alpha teen. <br />
<br />
Ty, on his end, decided on putting every single shoe box in just one bag, he just made the bag bigger inside than it was outside, so it didn&#39;t look like he had bought so many things. Then, with a single thought, Ty cleaned Hunter&#39;s pants and underwear. He didn&#39;t want to make Hunter feel bad, he had done a great job and pleased him well. Ty said goodbye to Hunter with the promise of coming back, he was in the middle of a &#39;growth spurt&#39; anyway.<br />
<br />
After leaving the store, he decided to go to some others to get some cool looking clothes as well. He never had more than a pair of jeans or hand me downs, so he was thrilled on feeling the texture of high quality new clothes. He went to all the expensive stores and bought jackets, shirts, pants, underwear, even a tux. However, after so much shopping, he grew hungry.</p>
