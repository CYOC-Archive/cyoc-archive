<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Debuting in high school can lead to many kids trying to change their appearance in some way. Trist was not one of those kids. He was a bit of a dorky boy that played things like card/video games with his somewhat equally dorky friends. On occasion his parents would have him play with that girl Suzy from down the street... although they had been drifting a little.  Then one day during summer Trist was very interested in a magic powered computer that just entered the market, and he had saved up enough to get one. Sadly for Trist when he overclocked his magic computer... Well when magic radiated everything in his room it was a slight surprise to Trist, but not unexpected with the current level of magic tech. <br />
As Trist got to school he was thankful that his monstrous form was pretty humanoid, and he had gained some amount of magic to make the rest of him look human. You see Trist turned into a succubus, not even an incubus, but still felt that he was very much still male. So he did a lot of experimentation with some amount of magic his body has, and managed to work on a limited form of transformation. He couldn&#39;t make his form be or even look male, but he was able to give himself an androgynous form with a handsome face and minimal curves. Trist hoped that his baggy clothing would hide his rather slender form... and training bra. Trist was able to get his breasts really small, but a succubus&#39; chest is rather sensitive. Trist&#39;s mom dropped off her succubus daughter that she wished would try to act a little more girly, and Trist found his bros Dilan and Travis. Dilan was a short plump kid who always seemed to have a snack on him of some kind, and Travis had gotten pretty tall although was pretty skinny. <br />
&quot;Hey guys it&#39;s been awhile.&quot; Trist said forcing his voice to be somewhat low and masculine. <br />
&quot;Hey... Trist, do you have something in your throat?&quot; Dilan asked<br />
&quot;Um no just voice changing a bit.&quot;<br />
Travis said &quot;Sure... Oh did you guys see some of the new anime that came out a few days ago?&quot;<br />
Dilan smirked and said &quot;Yeah, like that one where that guy has that childhood friend with giant boobs?&quot; Trist&#39;s body felt a little switchy as it felt like there was something coming off of Dilan. <br />
Travis said &quot;I think they must&#39;ve been this big&quot; as he held out his arms in front of his chest with a decent gap. Trist could feel his body start shifting almost instinctually. Now that he thought of it Trist had basically only males been in contact with his dad fleetingly when he wasn&#39;t out on buisness, and his brother who had a thing for tomboys and somewhat androgynous people which was how Trist had gotten so good at his limited transformations so fast... but he had been consciously trying to transform before. Now however Trist could feel his breasts start straining against the small training bra he had put on. <br />
Trist started panicking a little and dashed off as he said &quot;Gotta got to the bathroom!&quot; his friends watched a little confused especially since it seemed like their old friend seemed to be growing a bit of an ass as he ran. By the time Trist had found a bathroom he couldn&#39;t kid himself now that his boobs were the size of small grapefruits, and he had a nice sway to his hips. There was no way he could go into the men&#39;s bathroom like this, but to go into the... Trist sighed and thought to himself that this was about biology not about gender or something, and ran into the bathroom. Trist went into a stall, closed the lid, wiped it down a bit, and then sat inspecting the damage to his body. He fished the busted training bra he took now that it basically didn&#39;t work anymore, and considering how his baggy pants were now pooling a bit on the floor it&#39;s possible he shrank a little. Was this his punishment for not telling them he was now a succubus? For trying to force himself into a male position?<br />
Trist took an internal deep breath as he attempted to focus on his transformation magic again... It was a lot harder though without a target, and his brother was the only one he knew with a fetish for more androgynous girls. As Trist focused on his magic...</p>
