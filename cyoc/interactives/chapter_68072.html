<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was another gentleman that Ty saw across the room.<br />
<br />
One that had been working out most of his life.<br />
<br />
Ty saw a look in his eyes that made him wonder what thoughts this man held.<br />
<br />
As he searched his mind all he could find was a sense of missed opportunities.<br />
<br />
Ty for hours searched the old man's mind. He had been a body builder. Sober as a judge. Pure as one could be. <br />
And faithful to the wife who's passing left him wondering through the rest of his years in search of himself.<br />
<br />
What had he missed?<br />
<br />
All Ty could tell was that given the chance this man would do things differently. And that intrigued Ty to no <br />
end.<br />
<br />
Ty made a wish. A simple wish that when the man, Peter, woke the next morning he would be 16 once again and a <br />
new life to live. He gave him the means to live his life in the manor he desired and the memories of his past <br />
life. If Ty manipulated him further than his age and financial resources then Peter wouldn't be living out his <br />
life. And Ty was intrigued by the possibilities for this man.<br />
<br />
As Peter woke the next morning he noticed that he no longer had the creeks in his joints that years of lifting <br />
had over stressed him causing those morning aches.<br />
<br />
He almost jumped from his bed.<br />
<br />
As he looked at himself he noticed that his chest no longer had those grey hairs that had been meticulously shaved when he grew older until he gave up completely on the futile attempts to halt the aging process.<br />
<br />
His hands didn't ache with arthritis and he felt the stubble of a new grown beard. One that hadn't seen the <br />
years of scraping from a well honed steel blade. He raised his hand to his face and found a soft set of hairs <br />
protruding from the crest of his chin.<br />
<br />
This was amazing. He must be dreaming. Peter rushed to the mirror and back looked that boyhood face he had so <br />
long ago forgotten. <br />
<br />
Peter tried to make sense of this but just stared at his image. Wondering how this was even possible.<br />
<br />
Ty hadn't forgotten to give Peter the wardrobe to befit this new body, he intentionally left the clothes of an <br />
old man populating the closet and highboy. The boxers were neatly folded, the button downs were properly <br />
starched and aligned. He no longer had any workout shorts just some well worn sweat pants cut at the thighs <br />
showing some nice definition to a well kept body.<br />
<br />
Peter showered, caressing his abs. Prodding every inch of his revitalized body, hoping that if this was a <br />
dream he would never awaken.<br />
<br />
As he dressed he realized the attire, being that of one in his late 60's made him look as though he was going <br />
to a funeral.<br />
<br />
Peter found a nice sporty convertible parked in his garage, a perk from his second childhood as his wife would <br />
have said.<br />
<br />
Driving through town with the top down, the wind flowing through his auburn hair. He would stop at a light and <br />
turn to smile at the girls or guys staring at this hot guy in this nice car.<br />
<br />
Peter went shopping and tossed those boxers opting for some more racy under gear. Holding his amble package.<br />
<br />
His body hugging shirts and his tight pants leaving nothing to the imagination. It was almost as though being <br />
naked would have shown less.<br />
<br />
Peter tossed his purchases in the trunk and headed out to a park where he saw some guys his age hanging out.<br />
<br />
When he sat across the park from them, letting them notice him and eventually coming to see who was driving <br />
that hot car.<br />
<br />
He, one said. Nice car your dad has.<br />
<br />
Not my dads.<br />
<br />
Ok then your mom's.<br />
<br />
Nah.<br />
<br />
That ain't your car.<br />
<br />
'K. Peter got up and headed back to his car feeling the presence of the boys in close pursuit.<br />
<br />
What do you want?<br />
<br />
Just wanted to see the car.<br />
<br />
Just don't get your grubby fingers on it.<br />
<br />
No worries.<br />
<br />
As Peter climbed into his car one, John said hey where ya going?<br />
<br />
Don't know. Got no plans.<br />
<br />
Wanna hang with us for a bit? We got some good shit?<br />
<br />
Was that code for pot? Peter was so out of this that he didn't even know what he meant. Looking the boy up and <br />
down he came back after what seemed like 10 minutes with a 'K.<br />
<br />
Here?<br />
<br />
God no lets go to my place my parents aren't home.<br />
<br />
Peter drove the 4 to his place and they found their way to his room located in a refurbished basement.<br />
<br />
Nice. Peter said the sarcasm cutting like a knife.<br />
<br />
Yea well at least they leave me alone.<br />
<br />
John pulled out a baggie and rolled a joint.<br />
<br />
The guys passed it around and Peter was toasted. The others had built up a resistance but Peter was a <br />
lightweight at this point.<br />
<br />
Ya wanna get something to eat?<br />
<br />
Peter ordered several pizzas and he and his new friends spent the rest of the day smoking, eating and watching <br />
bad movies.<br />
<br />
Ty hadn't seen Peter in about six months but he couldn't have been faulted for not recognizing him anyway. The <br />
young Peter was so different from the old man he had wondered about so many months ago.<br />
<br />
He was tatooed, and pierced. His months of drug use and addiction to fast food had found him looking quite the <br />
modern teen. Those tight clothes had been replaced with baggy outfits that hid the love handles, and the pale <br />
skin.<br />
<br />
He wasn't gay but he did now have a boyfriend that he experimented with particularly when he was flying on <br />
some acid. That was one thing he craved more than anything. He had tried sex when he was wasted but found that <br />
he was unable to get excited however the sensations he felt when he was being fucked were so much more intense <br />
than any he had ever had with his wife.<br />
<br />
Peter had grown to experience all the pleasures of man becoming the image of the Bacchus.</p>
