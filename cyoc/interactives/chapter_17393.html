<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing by that pasture's fence I watched the herd of goats grazing. Some part of me thought of the peace and serenity of the scene played out before me. The sounds of baaing goats had some fantastic alurement, yet the one male goat's bleating seemed to suggest he was in agony.<br />
<br />
My eye searched for the male, he being so simular to the herd's general color scheme of their interbred selves be all alike.<br />
<br />
From deep within me came an urge my mind fought the desire, but with standing there and listening to those nanny goats and their billy bleating, it finally came out.<br />
<br />
A deep inhale and then I let loose a screaching bleat which made the entire herd jump to the ready. Some bleated back at me as if my call was in some other language than their own. It was as if they did not understand me and the sound I made.<br />
<br />
A bobbing head came my way, from out of the thickest part of the herd came the large black and grayed billy.<br />
<br />
Marching my way he came to within a few yards of me and then lowered his head while pawing the ground. He snorted and raising his head he eyed me with those brillant yellow pupils. He stood waiting for me to make a move toward him or as what happened I turned away and walked back to my car.<br />
<br />
As I drove away the Billy bleated triumphantly to his herd and pranced back to join them having stood his ground and won.<br />
<br />
My thinking was that had the herd been ponies and the Billy then a herd stallion, I might have jumped the fence and challanged him for the rights. Yet this seemed not to be, and I drove off my goat like male part erect and bound under my clothes.<br />
<br />
The pangs of sensual fantasy I'd known for so long to be as something other than what I was born had me wondering about my sanity. To want reason a man who has attained as much as I would throw it to the wind and longingly wish to be something kept in bondage. To be as some working animal that lives bound by straps of leather and has lost his since of personal freedom, was that what I wanted?<br />
<br />
My first inclination was to say, no, but almost in the same breath I think to say yes if the right situation came my way.<br />
<br />
Then a wonderment, a thought, the specticles and the spirit which governed them, maybe it had a way! A faster drive to home and once inside the house I went for my wall safe where the specticles were kept.<br />
<br />
At first a thought to begin right then and there but the wife was near, and she would wonder. My passion to know and find a way for being either my manly self again and the wife a total woman, or living a life of that long desired fantasy as a pony, like Mike!<br />
<br />
The old homestead where Kevin and I grew up was not that far away I could not go there and try to ask the spirit of my questions. It seemed the right place because there just a few decades back there roamed a wonder stallion pony and his mares.<br />
<br />
I was packed up and ready to drive away but heard the whimpering cries coming from upstairs, it was the wife. My pangs for self died off for the moment as I went upstairs to see what troubled her.<br />
<br />
The passionate sort of presidential situation between me and Connie had made me infected with her part of that time logged curse. It was after that and before I realized the curse having been transfered into me as well, that I had sexual pleasures with the wife. Now she was crying and I wondered if something was happening, if she too was now a part of this wretchid curse.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to our bedroom she had her back toward me as she sat by her makeup table, the glowing lights lighting up the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear?&quot; I said in a tone of soft but concerned manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don't come in, please don't look at me I'm, I'm ugly!&quot; she moaned at me.<br />
<br />
The dearest had just taken a shower and was making herself ready for us to go out to dinner as we'd planned. Seated at her mother's makeup table all adorned with six bulbs of bright lights. she was in her robe and nothing else.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the trouble, and your not ugly!&quot; I remember my words as the wondering thought of her maybe being part of my curse now taunted my mind.<br />
<br />
I stepped into the room and moved to stand directly behind her. She looked up at me, her eyes red from crying. I said nothing but placed my hands on her shoulders trying to show my love and concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked her again.<br />
<br />
In a quick move she tore open her robe to reveal that wonderful slender form she kept from her youth. I jumped back seeing in the mirror what she was so upset about. The curse had entered her and since our pleasured romp together it had begun to spread like it did on Connie.<br />
<br />
Standing up and shedding off the robe from her shoulders my dear wife stood presenting herself to me. The slender form was still perfect but she was coated from shoulders down to feet with a mixed blend of black, brown, and tan colored hair. It remeinded me of the goats I'd seen that afternoon and I knew her fear and pain. <br />
<br />
Not only did she now have the skin and hair of a goat but her toes she lifted a foot up, they were changing to look like black cloven hooves. She turned before me as if modeling one of her royal gowns. I saw those tight buttocks which were pouty and round, now were becoming narrowed. Thighs were broader that what I'd touched before and her rump had a bump sticking up which she felt and I knew was the forming of a tail.<br />
<br />
Hands out to her sides she glared at me, her eyes, those hazel pupils were now like those of that goat I'd seen. Squared bright yellow pupils now peered back at me from the scared and crying face of my dear wife.<br />
<br />
As terrible of fear I had for her and the sorrow anyone would feel for their wife now feeling such horror, I suddenly felt myself getting erect. <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of disease is this?&quot; she asked me her voice cracking from the fear she was feeling.<br />
<br />
As I stood there she stopped her crying and tilting her head back she sniffed the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell so very nice dear, I can tell you like this in me!&quot; she said as I stood there stunned. She walked close to me and her hands sunk down into my pants grabbing that goat sized shaft in her nimble fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need to talk!&quot; I said but she suddenly was engroused with the same blinding passion that Connie had as she was mutating.<br />
<br />
With a burst of beastly strength the wife swung me to flop on the bed as with those very nimble finger she tried to undress me for some wild bestial fun. We fought, her for the pleasure of feeling the sensations of becoming a nanny goat, and I for the freedom from this horrid situation.<br />
<br />
Her panic for sensual delights made the curse work upon that slender body with renewed speed. I tried to defend myself while seeing her ears growing ever longer and sprouting hairs. Those nimble fingers too were getting blackened finger nails, as from her forehead poked into the light of day two pinheads of horns.<br />
<br />
Once she ripped off my trousers her eyes went wide and a long black tongue licked at lips changing from red to a deep black. Now she moved with such new grace as her finger tickled the monster red goat's cock into a fit of passion. I was loosing myself to her and then also to the curse which would, in time take us both to the pasture.</p>
