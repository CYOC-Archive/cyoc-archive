<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Odette had found it difficult to sleep after Jimmy had left but she must have since she had found it possible to change once again.  Odette had once again fixed her nose and adjusted her hair into a wavy pulled back style that would have required half an hour to achieve.  This time it had taken a second.  Her friends complimented her hair but did not seem to notice how she had done it.  Her father had done a double take when he saw her but he had chocked it up to her looking more grown up.  This was something new.  Her father had come to take the party girls home.<br />
<br />
The drive was quiet and subdued.  Everyone was too tired to gab and carry on as they would have which gave Odette the chance to think.  None of her friends had noticed the change but her father had.  It seemed that people who were in the same area as her did not seem to pay attention to the fact that she had changed but they could see the new her.  She wondered if her family would always be able to recognize her.<br />
<br />
In her room at home Odette took a short rest to make up for the late night and the missed sleep.  Awaking to find her normal self.  That was the new normal self.  Loki's group changes had left her as an attractive version of Odette.  A little older than the teen-aged girl she had been.  She now had larger breasts and a tighter waist.  Her skin was tanned and blemish free.  She was healthy and fit and likely to stay like that for some time to come.  Odette had everything that she could have dreamed of yesterday, but she felt the need to experiment with her new power.  She wanted more.<br />
<br />
After a quick shower she stood in her room dressed in loose sweat pants and an over-sized cotton shirt.  Odette was at a loss for what to do.  She wanted to make a list of what to try but found it empty after a half hour her imagination seemed to fail her at the moment.  She would have to start small.  Locking her door, she removed her shirt and took a place in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Loki.  Loki,&quot; she said, and felt the full body blush of power.<br />
<br />
Odette focused on her stomach.  Following her thoughts, her abdominal muscles tightened and defined themselves.  The muscles filled out and hardened becoming the well defined six-pack only found on muscle magazine covers.  The numbness of the change was preventing her from feeling just how hard they were but Odette was not pleased.  Softening her thoughts her stomach smoothed and became soft once again.<br />
<br />
Her hips were now under her focus and they widened as she watched.  The hip bones pushed outward making her profile ever more bottom heavy.  Her waist seemed to shrink as her hips stretched her pant's elastic to the limit.  Pausing for a minute, Odette rubbed her hands over her exaggerated hips.  They were so wide she could not even see both ends in the narrow mirror.   Odette was laughing too herself as she walked around her room.  She sat on her bed and tried to lay on her side.  The excessive width of her hips made this simple act difficult and before long she found herself doubled over with laughter.  On her back, she found it impossible to roll off the soft mattress.  She eventually calmed down enough to focus on shrinking her hips so she could get up.<br />
<br />
Using her power for so long was having an effect on Odette.  The long-held magic in her body was approximating arousal.  Odette felt good and wanted it to continue.  Staring into the mirror she decided to turn to her breasts.  At the moment they were round and larger than she had yesterday.  But they were still within the realm of average.  She wanted to change that.  Staring at her breasts in the mirror she thought to make them bigger.  Slowly they grew.  Like every other part of her body that was changed her breasts went numb.  The rest of her body was tingling but her breasts were like fuzzy balls of nothing.  Odette felt her breasts grow larger still.  Using her hands she could heft the mounds of flesh feeling the increased weight.  Under her hands she felt the skin, hot and tight but yielding to her touch.  The breasts grew round and proud remaining high and perky on her ribs.  She checked their growth when they were the size of her head then made them rounder and more fake looking.  Finding her nipples, Odette then focused to make them larger and erect.  One then the other popped out suddenly reaching an inch in projection; tiny nubs on small domes pointing out from huge ball-like breasts.<br />
<br />
Her whole body was tingling, distracting her from her breasts.  One hand slipped to her crotch.  As the feeling came back to her breasts the added weight caught her shoulders pulling her forward.  Catching her breasts with her free hand sent further stimulation straight to her brain.  Her breasts were huge sacks of pleasure capped with points of stimulated nipples.  This coupled with the full-body tingle and the working of her privates made her catch her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; she moaned.  &quot;Loki!&quot; she called as an orgasm caused her knees to weaken.<br />
<br />
A minute later, Odette found herself laying on the floor, topless and sweaty.  The heat from her body leaving slowly.  Despite the embarrassment of losing control, she was awash with happiness.  At least until she sat up to find her inflated breasts remained.</p>
