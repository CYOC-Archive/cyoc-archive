<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn was a bit surprised to see Jeff&#39;s big black truck in his driveway when he pulled up. The pang of embarrassment that he was actually going to have to come out tonight, was really starting to get to him. &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Finn breathed as he got out of his car and headed inside, grabbing Dylan as well. &quot;Jeff?&quot; he called out. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; he grunted and headed around the large house, looking for his boyfriend. <br />
<br />
The shower outside his room was running. &quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there buddy. Almost done,&quot; Jeff replied. The water shut off and the steam started to settle. Jeff grabbed a towel, ran it against his black and white fur, then wrapped it around his waist. He stepped out into the hall and looked down at Finn. &quot;Nice hat,&quot; he smiled, pressing it down on Finn&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. It was Dylan&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan?&quot; Jeff raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
It caught Finn off guard, but he quickly realized what must have happened. &quot;Oh! Dylan,&quot; he pulled out the seafoam green fleshlight and show it to Jeff. &quot;I typed in that he only wanted to be fucked by me and I guess it must have made it so something weird must have happened with the phrasing and all he wanted to be was this. He grabbed my phone and changed himself into this so I guess he&#39;s happy. At least it sure felt that way.&quot; A smile filled the fox&#39;s face as he thought back to the experience. Absentmindedly, his thumb strummed the hole of Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;EE!&quot; Jeff&#39;s body went rigid. Every muscle in his body stretched as far as it could possibly go, making his already tall body that much bigger. His face twisted ever so slightly and whiskers twitched as he felt his hole pressed up against. The towel around his waist fell to the ground as his cock hardened, bouncing with excitement at the prospect of feeling what he&#39;d felt less than an hour ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Now it was Finn&#39;s turn to cock his own eyebrow as he saw the massive cock pointed directly at his face. &quot;You&#39;re still horned up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to play it off, leaning his muscular body against the doorframe. &quot;How can I not be when I&#39;m around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn felt his face burn at the compliment. It was hard for him to raise his face from the floor as the throbbing cock would fill his vision completely. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he dug one of his claws into a paw pad. &quot;But I don&#39;t think we should do anything until at least tonight. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;That shouldn&#39;t be a problem. But I still might need to take care of this...&quot; He pointed down at his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Right,&quot; Finn smiled. &quot;Why not try Dylan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it&#39;s a little weird naming a fleshlight... Right?&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed. <br />
<br />
Finn ignored him and grabbed his hand, pulling the big tiger into his room. &quot;Just try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the object with a bit of skepticism. &quot;You think I&#39;ll fit?&quot; he asked, holding it up next to his cock. The sleeve looked to be almost the exact same size. 10 inches wasn&#39;t exactly what these things were designed for unless specially made and with how thick he was, he doubted the small hole would be able to do anything either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try it,&quot; Finn squirmed. &quot;Dylan probably gave me the best experience of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only cause I haven&#39;t been able to do everything yet,&quot; Jeff challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardly,&quot; Jeff growled. He pressed the hole against the tip of his dick and tried to push down. His nostrils flared with agitation. The soft malleable plastic was suddenly harder than a rock. Fucking a metal pipe would have been better. He barely got the tip of his cock in before it constricted against the most sensitive part of his body. He threw the toy against the wall. &quot;Oh fuck man! What the fuck!&quot; he shouted angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?! What?!&quot; Finn jumped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny man,&quot; Jeff snarled. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you did it but don&#39;t. It&#39;s not funny to hurt a man there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? It felt amazing,&quot; Finn replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you like it so much, you can keep it,&quot; Jeff picked it up and tossed it at Finn. &quot;I&#39;m going to go see if your dad has something I can wear. At least I can say I&#39;m not in the mood anymore...&quot; He complained as he stomped down the hall to the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
Finn looked at the toy again, examining it from all sides. It felt exactly like it had earlier. &quot;Oh...&quot; Finn felt a bit of a chuckle as he realized what happened. &quot;Dylan only wants to be fucked by me... Oops... Is that right?&quot; there was a strange warm feeling radiating off the plastic. &quot;Right... Sorry about that.&quot; He continued to play with the hole, running his finger over the opening and sliding it in, ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
The warmth continued and Finn could almost feel it radiating through his body. Almost like it was saying, &#39;I know a way you can apologize.&#39;<br />
<br />
Finn felt his cock hardened as blood was rapidly running to it. He rocked back and forth in his computer chair. &quot;I mean...&quot; the horniness was returning and it&#39;d be a lot easier to talk with a clear mind and conscious. Without much debate, Finn dropped his shorts again. His slightly smaller than average cock pointed straight up. Finn leaned back in his chair and slid Dylan down onto his cock. The small hole opened around his cock, gently gliding against his skin.<br />
<br />
A shiver ran through Finn as more and more of his sensitive member was covered. And with the flesh picture of the buff naked tiger in mind, it was near impossible to think of anything other than sex. Just seeing those massive, well-defined muscles gently flex as Jeff moved was enough to get him boned up. Even if Jeff&#39;s fur was a bit wild from his shower, Jeff still looked like 100% man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Finn moaned as he lifted and lowered the device on his dick as he thought about Jeff&#39;s perfectly sculpted ass. The tendrils inside were working overtime, running up and down against his cock. Finding each and every one of the most sensitive nerves they possibly could to drive Finn into the most overstimulating bliss they possibly could. Finn&#39;s body slowly lowered more and more to the floor as his body wouldn&#39;t work to hold him in the chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... Mmmfph! Good...&quot; his body moaned as it gave more and more into the pleasure. His body came through and Finn felt himself finish inside the device. &quot;Oh yeah...&quot; his tongue hung out of his mouth as a thin layer of sweat coated his fur. He pulled Dylan off his cock, only to feel the tendrils try wrapping around and holding him in. &quot;It&#39;s alright. We can do it again,&quot; Finn smiled.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
&quot;What a sick prank,&quot; Jeff muttered angrily as he went into the master bedroom. Even if Dave was a bit shorter than him, he knew the large ram would have something close to his size. With how burly the former football stud was, Jeff knew he could find something. &quot;I didn&#39;t think Finn would do something like that... Is it something with his former personality breaking throu--?&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought was instantly halted as Jeff felt that familiar run against his anus. His cock instantly sprung into action and every part of him felt incredibly sensitive. He felt a deep rumble of a moan roll out of him as he fell down to his knees. His tongue fell out of his open mouth as his eyes glazed over. His ass naturally rose as though to accept something inside it.<br />
<br />
&#39;Someone&#39;s been a naughty kitty.&#39; Followed by some malicious laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Jeff slowly came to as he looked around. Still the dull haze of sex made it hard to think. However, looking at the floor, Jeff saw massive claw marks torn into the carpet. &quot;Oh sh--!&quot; followed by another, far more sensual, &quot;OOoooooohhh boy...&quot; That strange sexual heat rocketed through him again, making it impossible for his body to listen to him. His body fell onto the king sized bed, hands barely holding him up. But the moment he felt his asshole open, his hands squeezed, breaking the wooden frame of the bed.<br />
<br />
The unbelievably comforting warmth radiated through him as he felt his insides explored. With each new thrust, Jeff&#39;s powerful body would flex, twist, and claw at anything it could possibly get its hands on. His jaws hung open as drool dripped from his overstimulated mind. Pleasure was all he could think about. The feeling of being absolutely defenseless despite being the largest guy on the field radiated through him. Made him feel all the more powerless, yet all the more turned on.<br />
<br />
His large cock throbbed with excitement. It was dripping relentlessly as his balls churned. &quot;Oh gawd...&quot; he whimpered. The edge was so hard to keep. But felt so good. Every one of his muscles burned with excitement before Jeff finally felt his phantom fucker release inside him. The sudden splash on his insides was enough to get him to finish as well. Hefty loads of cum sprayed out of him, coating near everything it could touch.<br />
<br />
Jeff panted as his heart rate returned to normal. The euphoria from the wildest sex he&#39;d ever had still planted on his mind. Or maybe it was the strange feeling as the unknown cock seemed to almost pull back inside him, despite trying to pull out. Regardless, the smell of his cum was rapidly starting to fill his nose. And the mess he&#39;d made was dawning on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was in complete disarray. His claw marks ran through the carpet, bed and even some walls. The bed frame was completely broken. As was the dresser. However, it was the cum that was sprayed over damn near everything that was the biggest problem. It was already seeping into the covers and the mattress, as well as the carpet. Jeff had no idea how bad it would be if it was on the dresser or not. With the mess he made, there was no way for this to be a good time for Finn to come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; he stated again, running his hand against his chest. Only to find the sticky liquid there as well. His eyes went wide as he rushed to the master bedroom&#39;s bathroom. He quickly grabbed a towel and wiped himself off. But looking at the room again he knew there was only one answer. &quot;I need the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff did his best to dry himself off and grab some of Dave&#39;s clothes out of the hamper. He could lie about the smell if he said he didn&#39;t realize they were dirty. However, the room would have to stay hidden. He accidentally slammed the door behind him and Finn walked out.  His face twisted, however he seemed to be a bit out of it. &quot;Found something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah,&quot; Jeff said. <br />
<br />
The front door opened, and Dave&#39;s voice echoed through the house. &quot;Boys?&quot;</p>
