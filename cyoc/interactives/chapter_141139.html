<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick gasped as Jason pulled out of his ass. It felt so good. He grasped and kneaded Jared&#39;s thick muscular pecs. Jared groaned and leaned his head back against Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, that felt great!&quot; Jared exclaimed. He pulled off of Nick&#39;s dick. He turned around and kissed Nick full on the mouth. Nick moaned into the kiss before breaking apart. He was in a blissful, post-orgasmic daze. A hand was placed on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, handsome,&quot; Jason prodded. &quot;Go take a shower. The two of us will wash this sheet.&quot; Nick nodded and walked up the stairs. He really wasn&#39;t able to think a whole lot at the moment. He basked in the afterglow, more or less going through the motions as he entered the bathroom. He turned on the water and began showering. He began washing away Jason&#39;s cum from his ass. He closed his eyes and smiled at the memory. A different memory came to mind though. He remembered seeing Jason&#39;s pecs as boobs, hidden by a cheerleader&#39;s top.<br />
<br />
His mind snapped back to reality. Rebecca, his dad&#39;s girlfriend, had turned into this incredibly muscular jock who had the hots for Nick! And the same happened to his dad, too! He breathed heavily in horror, realizing that he had just had sex with his dad and his dad&#39;s girlfriend. Sure, he wanted a boyfriend, but he never wanted his dad to become his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff&#39;s computer,&quot; Nick said to nobody in particular. He quickly shut off the water and began drying himself off. That program had mentioned something about a gift transformation. Hadn&#39;t Rebecca and his dad been selected also? Clad in nothing but a towel, he sprinted across the hall to Jeff&#39;s room. The computer still had the program pulled up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Target: Nick Dawkins Gift Transformation Complete, Reality Alteration in Progress&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality alteration?&quot; Nick wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick, you finished in the shower?&quot; Jared called up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah!&quot; Nick called back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot; Jared replied. Nick turned back to the computer. To his surprise, he noticed that the wall was much further back. Jeff&#39;s bed was pushed up against the wall and had grown to a queen-sized bed. The room continued to change shape. Nick&#39;s desk appeared on one end of the room. His dad&#39;s desk appeared in another spot. The bedroom now was the size of a master bedroom, complete with a full bathroom and walk-in closet. It was the perfect size for three men living together. Nick remembered picking this house out for this reason.<br />
<br />
Where had that memory come from? He looked closely at the Chronivac program. He saw that he was able to pull up a status bar that broke down the &quot;Reality alteration&quot;. He clicked a couple of times and did so. He saw four progress bars, labeled &quot;Surroundings&quot;, &quot;Nick Dawson&quot;, &quot;Jason Darst / Rebecca Dobbs / Jeff Dawson&quot;, and &quot;Jared Darst / John Dawson&quot;. The progress bars for Jason and Jared were complete.<br />
<br />
Nick now understood why Rebecca and Jeff&#39;s names had been together like that. Rebecca and Jeff were the same person! Jeff had been turned into a girlfriend for their dad. And then, the two of them were turned into twin boyfriends for Nick! And now the house was changing around them! Nick looked again. His progress bar wasn&#39;t finished yet. But it could explain why he was getting these memories with Jason and Jared. Some of them were kind of sweet. Like when they met, how Jason had first flirted with Nick during class. And then Nick ended up flirting with Jared later, thinking that he was Jason. But Jason rolled with it, liking the fact that this handsome man was hitting on him so directly. When the three of them realized that both brothers were attracted to the same guy, they tried the dating game. Two years later, here they were, sharing a house that bought together.<br />
<br />
“Wait, two years?” Nick wondered. “But I’m 22. No, that’s…that’s not right. I’m…” He started to think that he was really supposed to be 18, but that seemed ridiculous. Right? Of course it was ridiculous! He shook his head of that bizarre notion. He failed to notice that his legs lengthened slightly, and his shoulders were slowly getting wider. The memories of his dad and brother, and even Rebecca, were slowly fading away into oblivion. It became increasingly difficult to remember Jason and Jared as anyone other than his boyfriends. He had a few options to choose:<br />
<br />
He could stop the computer and switch them back to their original selves. But would they remember the sex the three of them shared? Nick hoped not. Jeff and his dad didn’t even know Nick was gay. That would be the worst coming out experience ever. He could just roll with it and lose the memories he was struggling to hold onto. But he loved his little brother, Jeff, and his dad! Who would become his new dad? Would the Chronivac replace Jeff or would Nick suddenly be an only child? There was a third option that seemed to grow in his mind as well: He could mess around more with the Chronivac. Jeff/Rebecca/Jason doesn’t seem to remember it. Maybe Nick could change some more things?</p>
