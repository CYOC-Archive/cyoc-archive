<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A team of archaeologist was hard of work carefully uncovering the secrets of his newly discovered tomb located under an ancient Greek temple dedicated to the goddess Athena.<br />
<br />
“Strange.” said the youngest member of the team as he looked at the columns “It’s in a very ancient writing, it is hard to understand what it is saying. Only thing I am getting is a warning to not let her out.” <br />
<br />
“Her?” asked a second member of the team as she took some photos of where she found some ancient bronze weapons. <br />
<br />
“Medusa.” Said the head of the group as he pointed toward what looked to be a doorway cut into the stone by the far wall. The entire place was illuminated by multiple high beam lights, so it was as bright as noon day. <br />
<br />
“Medusa?” inquired a third member of the team.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Said Professor leading them as he used a brush to remove some of the dust from the “door” it showed the classic image of a monstrous woman’s face with multiple snakes instead of hair. “I believe this was some kind of tomb.”<br />
<br />
“A tomb for Medusa?” inquired a fourth member of the group<br />
<br />
“Not a true tomb, but a way for the temple to make money.” said Professor “Image you have journeyed from Athens or Sparta to visit this remote temple which has the tomb of Medusa, the monster which turns anyone who looks upon her to stone. Once here you are led down the stairs into this tomb, filled with smoke with some guards holding those bronze weapons and are told that behind this door is the monster. Please support the temple with a humble offering of coin.”<br />
<br />
“Ah…I get it.” said the youngest member “It’s a scam.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t call it a scam.” stated the head of the group “Multiple other ancient temples did the same across multiple civilizations.”<br />
<br />
“Some would say multiple churches and temples still do it.” stated the fourth member of the group as she focused the image on her camera and took another photo. <br />
<br />
“True.” laughed the Professor leading this team as he looked at the image of Medusa on the wall before reaching out and touching it. “It will have to find a way to remove this so we can see if there is anything behind it.”<br />
<br />
“We can use ground radar to see if anything is there.” Said the youngest member<br />
<br />
“Good idea.” Said the leader his hand still on the image. “Strange it is warm…”<br />
<br />
“Really?” said the 4th member before she noticed the look of terror on the face of their leader. “Professor?”<br />
<br />
“I…I can’t move my hand.” said the professor as everyone looked at him with some fear before suddenly his hand moved away from the image.<br />
<br />
“Ah…very funny professor.” stated the youngest member, not realizing that his professor’s hand was moving without his own control. <br />
<br />
“Do not try to resist me, Professor Stonewall.” said a female voice inside his head. “Stonewall, kind of funny considering.”<br />
<br />
“What is happening, who are you?” inquired Professor Stonewall<br />
<br />
“I am Medusa goddess of Naga’s and creatures you would all Medusas” answered the voice as Stonewall’s hand moved up and removed his baseball hat letting it drop to the ground. “I thank you for touching the seal containing my body, those damn ancient wizards where able to contain my body but failed to contain my soul. You held on just long enough for my soul to transfer over here.”<br />
<br />
“Your soul?” thought Professor Stonewall <br />
<br />
“Yes, don’t worry part of you will survive the change.” stated Medusa “Not just your memories which will be useful in rebuilding my kingdom and my people but some of your personality traits with transfer over.”<br />
<br />
“What does that mean?” inquired Professor Stonewall as his other hand moved up to his head touching his hair. <br />
<br />
“Well, I am taking this body.” stated Medusa as Professor Stonewall’s blood turned to ice.<br />
<br />
“Professor?” inquired a voice as Professor Stonewall’s hands moved through his hair. As it they did, his short brown hair became longer and thicker.<br />
<br />
From the outside his team looked on in confusion and fear as they watched Professor Stonewall’s hair become longer and thicker. There was no way that should be possible, and it got even scarier as his hair bundled together into thicker groups almost like braids before suddenly they started to move on their own. Then the hair began to change color into a green with spots of black in it.<br />
<br />
“Professor what the?” asked another person as Professor Stonewall moved around and removed his glasses. When he opened his eyes, his blue eyes had turned into a yellowish green as all his hair snapped forward and opened up to show that the braids had become live snakes. All of them hissed showing multiple fangs and their own yellowish eyes.<br />
<br />
“My…G…o…” started one of them but all of them stopped in place unable to move.<br />
<br />
“What did you do to them?” inquired Professor Stonewall to the creature who now controlled his body.<br />
<br />
“Ancient legends say I would turn those who looked to me to stone.” Laughed Medusa “In truth, I freeze them in place until I transform them into my subjects, but first I need to make myself more at home.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the team watched unable to move, they couldn’t even blink or change where their eyes were looking which was horrifying as they watched the changes happening to their professor.<br />
<br />
His hands moved up to his face and ran down his face, as his hands ran down his face his skin peeled off as his bones shifted. His face became much more feminine and actually extremely beautiful his eyes seemed larger now as greenish scales appeared around the eyes like some kind of natural makeup.<br />
<br />
His face now looked like it belonged on a supermodel his hands moved down his neck, it becoming thinner and more elegant with scales around the edges. His hands moved down the side of his body, his clothes moving as his body shifted. The fat he had gained from a combination of old age and the like shifted to become a very nice set of breasts which were pushing out from his shirt. His right hand moved down his left as it became thinner and more feminine. He repeated the process on his left, so now his entire upper body was that of a beautiful woman with greenish skin with multiple scales visible as well. <br />
<br />
He removed his shirt tossing it to the side, showing her breasts which had to be C cups or more. Black and dark green scales replaced skin starting under his breasts and running down his side making a V shape which disappeared under his pants. He slipped off his pants and underwear showing that he was still a man but that quickly changed as his hands moved over his crotch as his dick moved within his body. <br />
He was now a she.<br />
<br />
Then she ran her hands down the sides of her legs as they fused together as it quickly became covered with scales. Finally the last bit of humanity was gone as the Professor which they had worked with for months or even years had been replaced with a beautiful snake women with snakes for hair.<br />
<br />
“I thank you all for freeing me.” Stated the creature their professor had become, her voice was strong, yet it could give a person a hard on almost instantly. “I am Queen Medusa Goddess of Nagas and you will have the great honor of being my first new subjects.”</p>
