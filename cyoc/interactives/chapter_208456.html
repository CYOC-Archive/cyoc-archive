<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some discussion with Daniel, you decide to go on a Thursday night because you want to see what wild transformations people come up with and maybe try some yourself.<br />
<br />
-- Later, on Thursday --<br />
<br />
After some days of waiting restlessly, it was finally time for you and Daniel to go to the mansion on the edge of town to your first transformation party! It was a sunny day so you both decided to ride bikes there. All the way you daydreamed about what transformations you wanted to try.<br />
<br />
You pulled up to a gated mansion and were let in once Daniel told the guard a password. Upon entering, there was an atrium with various people drinking champagne and eating hors-d&#39;ourves. Daniel led you down a staircase to what looked kinda like a fancy locker room not to dissimilar from what you&#39;d see at a nicer gym. Taking Daniel&#39;s lead, you take off your sweatshirt and backpack and shoes and put them in a locker leaving yourself in shorts, underwear, socks, and a tank top shirt.<br />
<br />
This room had several rows of lockers, a bathroom area, and shower area and you also noticed that it was not gender-segregated, in fact you could see a wide variety of genders. On the back side of the room were several doors leading to another area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those doors lead to the transformation rooms,&quot; explained Daniel who had noticed you looking curiously at the doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exciting!&quot; you replied, &quot;Let&#39;s check &#39;em out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Daniel walked into what looked similar to a dressing room at a theatre or a green room at a concert venue. One side of the room had floor-to-ceiling mirrors with AR displays. There were barstool-height chairs in front of each mirror and a tablet computer seemed to be connected to each mirror&#39;s station.<br />
<br />
Daniel sat down on a chair and touched the tablet screen. You sat down and did the same and a message popped up on the mirror saying that any changes made on the tablet screen would update your image in the mirror to preview your changes and that once you decided on your changes, you could select &#39;Transform&#39; to implement the current changes.<br />
<br />
Looking to your right, you could see Daniel starting to alter his appearance in the mirror. His mirror image was naked even though Daniel was actually wearing black boxer briefs and a white t-shirt. &quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; you thought, &quot;there must be an option on the tablet to remove or change clothing on the preview in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found the clothing option on the tablet and pressed &#39;no clothing.&#39; Your reflection in the mirror was now naked. Meanwhile, Daniel had seemingly increased his muscle mass and lengthened the hair on his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of transformation are you gonna try?&quot; Daniel asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. There are so many options!&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you can do a random change,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I don&#39;t like it,&quot; you replied, &quot;like if it&#39;s really weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a preview so you don&#39;t have to keep it.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll try it if you do.&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
You found the option for random transformation and both of you pressed it at the same time on the count of three.<br />
<br />
Your reflection in the mirror immediately changed to have two sets of arms on each side of your torso with the additional set right below. Weird! The addional arms moved along with your additional arms and it felt weird to see a different configuration of limbs in your reflection than what you actually had.<br />
<br />
Daniel&#39;s change wasn&#39;t immediately obvious to you. &quot;What&#39;s different?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s something with my balls,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I have four balls!&quot; He moved his dick to the side revealing that he did indeed have two additional balls. &quot;I wonder if that means I cum more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet so,&quot; you said, &quot;Having four arms is a lot to get used to. It&#39;s interesting but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to keep it right now.&quot; You used the tablet to remove the extra arms. &quot;Are you going to keep the four balls?&quot; you ask Daniel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I think it&#39;s cool and I want to see if it makes me cum more,&quot; said Daniel, &quot;Want to do another [random change]?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Again on the count of three, you both pressed &#39;random change.&#39;<br />
<br />
Looking at your reflection, you immediatly noticed your change - your dick and balls were replaced with a pussy!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Looking good,&quot; exclaimed Daniel, &quot;You look cute with a pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying out different genitals was appealing to you though you didn&#39;t know if it was the first change you wanted to try out. It was quite cute though. You normally had a fair amount of pubes, but it seems that this change had also reduced your pubic hair by about half.<br />
<br />
Daniel&#39;s change was a bit more subtle, but he had lost all of his body hair. Combined with the increased muscle mass from earlier and long hair on his head, he looked handsome and well built but in a way also looked feminine or at least like a pretty boy.<br />
<br />
Turning back to yourself, you decided that you wanted a dick for now, so you restored it on the tablet. Your dick was pretty average: cut, about seven inches hard, and pretty compact when soft. You opted to increase the hard length to ten inches, add a little girth, and like Daniel, add two additional balls. The view in the mirror once you input those changes was pretty sexy and you couldn&#39;t wait to test out your modified equipment.<br />
<br />
You also decided to remove all your body hair and make your arms and torso more muscular because of how good those changes looked on Daniel. You also made your ass a litle rounder and firmer.<br />
<br />
Daniel was finalizing his changes too. You looked over, and he had seemingly not made any further changes but was just admiring himself in the mirror. He did look pretty good!<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to finalize the changes?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; he replied, &quot;let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You both hit finalize and you could feel your body start to transform. Your muscles bulged out, especially your arms, abs, and pecs. The feeling of your dick lengthening and the extra balls growing in your sack was hard to describe, but good. Your clothes also disappeared.<br />
<br />
Daniel was admiring his transformations too. You both exited the back door of the change room and found yourselves in a hallway with a wide variety of mostly very attractive people. A woman with two rows of breasts walked by and then an anthro girl with grey fur. You hadn&#39;t thought of that type of change.<br />
<br />
You walked down the hall to a room lined with bookshelves like a library. What happens next?</p>
