<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in his house, Max body shutters on its own. Something about Hayden was making the Big Bad Wolf power worried. Max had never felt this way over the past week of having this new power. It confused him, but nothing in the Big Bad Wolf information in his mind told him why. Finally, Max just put it off as him having met Hayden out of nowhere and the idea that he was in the house listening to him and Julie talk. <br />
<br />
Knowing that he was alone for the moment, Max grows out his tail, hoping that the strange feeling would pass. And it slowly did as he took care of his chores around the house. He cleaned up the pans and plates that his mom used for breakfast before dusting the house. He even changed his bed sheets, them having wolf fur covering some of them. After setting the sheets on to wash, he looked at the time to see that it wasn’t even noon yet. <br />
<br />
Having the whole day still ahead of him, and talking about them to Julie, Max decides that he wants to head out to the trails for the day. He was out on the trails a few nights before, but he was in his wolf form then. Max thought that he could get some good hiking in, maybe some good pics to post online, and maybe (Depending on how many people were out there) some daytime wolf form in. His tail wagged at the thought of being able to run around in the daytime in his full wolf form. When he did it at night, he was worried that he would make too much noise and wake up some of the animals or nearby people. But during the day, that shouldn’t be a problem. <br />
<br />
Max texted his mom his plans (leaving out the wolf parts) and got changed into some more appropriate clothes for the trails. He places his phone on vibrate before putting it into an armband case. Max found out, by happy accident, that the armband case could stretch to his Big Bad Wolf size with ease. Once ready, Max retracts his tail before walking out his door and locking up the house. On the way out, he waves again to Julie, who was still unloading the truck. He didn’t see her dad and assumed that he was inside the house. <br />
<br />
It didn’t take long to reach the trail entrance from the neighborhood. The trails themselves were set up with four levels of difficulty, giving everyone a chance to enjoy them. The lower to levels were paved trails, with plenty of maps and directions to make sure no one would get lost. The third level was unpaved, but still mostly easy to follow, every few miles, a map etched into a wood sign. The level four trails were more just the open woods. There was the occasional marker to tell you how far you were from the main tail head, but not much more. It wasn’t uncommon for visitors to get lost out on the level four trails, as only locals who walk the woods knowing the way. <br />
<br />
Max was one of these locals. He would walk the woods with his parents, his mother using her old training to teach him how to read the trees to tell which way he was. Now with the Big Bad Wolf powers too, he could use his sense smell and hearing to track where he had been and listen for the people on the trails or nearby neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Max quickly makes his way along the level one and level two trails, finding the entrance for level three. Walking through the level three trails, he changes his muscles slightly to walk faster than usual through the unpaved trails. There didn’t seem to be that many people out that day and Max was growing with excitement at the idea of running around during the daytime.<br />
<br />
By the time he made it to the level four trail head, he was ready to change right there in the open to his wolf form. He couldn’t understand why he felt so energetic, but he just wanted to let loose some after a week of being so careful. <br />
<br />
He makes his way further into the woods, sniffing the air and listening to see if there was anyone nearby. He didn’t detect anyone. He checked his phone one more time, making sure he didn’t miss any calls or texts from his mom or dad before starting his change. <br />
<br />
Focusing on his change, Max’s body starts to grow larger by the second. By this point, he had all but mastered his transformation and knew how to speed it up or slow it down. He wanted to go fast. <br />
<br />
As he walked quickly through the forest, his shoes started to tighten to his growing feet. The material screeched as his feet expanded and pushed out. Tears start to form along the side of his shoes and with only a few steps, the shoes explode with wolf-like paws taking their place. The fragments of the shoes slowly disintegrate, waiting to be rebuilt when Max returned to his human form. <br />
<br />
Max’s pants were next to show strain under the boy’s changing body’s force. The athletic shorts start to strain with his thickening thighs and butt. Even his penis was showing change, the pants’ fabric outlining the growing sheath and balls. The sounds of ripping fabric came quickly as his tail burst out from behind. <br />
<br />
At the same time, Max’s chest and arms did a number on his shirt. The article had no chance as his chest barrel out and biceps expanded. Even his growing fur ripped off the few threads that tried to hold on. <br />
<br />
Last, his face pushed out as his ears grew pointed and moved to the top of his head. His wolf snout and hearing was now picking up people and animals up to miles away, letting Max know he was truly alone. <br />
<br />
Now fully in his Big Bad Wolf form, and having only the phone arm band on, Max checks his phone one last time before going into a full sprint into the woods.</p>
