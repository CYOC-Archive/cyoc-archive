<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wiss my mommy to be Mawy for the weekend and I was in hew home.&quot; Johnny said out loud.<br />
<br />
 Immediately his surroundings changed zooming past him so fast that he felt sick. He fell onto his hands and knees. Immediately reality had changed and he was in a little boy&#39;s bed room.  There was a crib, a rocking chair, some toys, and a changing table. He looked at his spellbook and immediately wished, &quot;tuwn spewwbook into colowing book.&quot;It immediately changed into a coloring book. Looking up he saw Mary was standing in the doorway and he dropped his coloring book. She had long black hair that complimented her brown sundress. Her was down to her chest where he gazed at her nice perky breasts. He imagined the things he wanted to do to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Johnny changing his mind looked at the changing table and saw there were some diapers and some pull ups. He wasn&#39;t interested in changing his age yet. &quot;Maybe later&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I big boy mommy, me want puww up&quot; johnny said while he pointed at his diaper. Mary crossed her arms. She walked over to him and stuck two fingers down the front of his diaper touching the tip of his penis. He wasn&#39;t sure if that turned him on more than usual or if the spell was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh how cute. Someone&#39;s dry. Alright sweetie. If you wet your pull up, you&#39;re going in a diaper for the rest of the day. Now lay down for mommy&quot; Johnny happily laid on the floor. She grabbed the diaper bag and a pullups from the changing table. She untaped his diaper and pulled the front down revealing his erection pointed towards him. He needed to make sure he didn&#39;t pee. She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww how cute. Someone&#39;s happy this morning. Looks like you didn&#39;t wet your diaper yet. Now stand for mommy.&quot; She pulled the diaper away from him and partially folded it inside the diaper bag. Johnny stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok sweetie, let&#39;s get this on you and hopefully some clothes today.&quot; She guided his legs into the holes of the pull-up until it fit snuck against his groin. She then grabbed a spare shirt from the diaper bag and started to put it on him. He then started unknowingly having tantrum backing away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I guess no clothes today. It&#39;s Monday and Mommy is running late for work. Time to go sweetie.&quot; She picked Johnny and the diaper bag up, she shifted him to her waist while walking out the door<br />
<br />
 This isn&#39;t my wish. It&#39;s supposed to be the weekend. I was supposed to be home all weekend with her. He wasn&#39;t going out in public like this was he? He started crying and having a tantrum in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Home, mommy&quot; he cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sweetie, Mommy has to work but you get to hang out with Linda today. You love being around Linda and she always takes good care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She opened up her car door and put him in a car seat in the back. She handed him a sippy cup to calm him down.<br />
&quot;Now drink up and you&#39;ll be with Linda soon, okay sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped his crying and started drinking it when she got into the front seat. In minutes he was asleep. When Johnny woke up, he was being handed to someone else. He looked up for a second and sucked from his bottle. Confused he looked at it. <br />
&quot;It was a sippy cup not too long ago&quot; he thought<br />
<br />
He looked up at beautiful blonde woman now holding him. He looked down at her long hair covering her large breasts and immediately fell in love with them. If this is Lisa, he&#39;s in heaven. He then felt his gut rumble. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go poopy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at him. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok hun, I&#39;ll take you to the teachers lounge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teachers lounge? He looked around and realized his mom brought him to school. Where was he going to go he wondered. She carried him through the empty hallways to and opened the door to a room. Looked like standard coffee break room but it threw him off seeing a changing station. Thankfully empty like the hallway. He assumed they were all in class.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to let you down and you can run to your chair, ok? Be sure to keep the door open if you need help&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Johnny was set down and saw a bathroom. He ran to it holding his stomach. He saw a child&#39;s potty chair on the floor by the sink. He dropped his pullups to the floor and sat on the potty chair. He felt his bowels release.  Looking over he couldn&#39;t find toilet paper. He decided to put the pull up on and deal with the mess. <br />
<br />
He felt his dirty butt get stuck to the pull-up. He toddled out of the bathroom starting to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t wipe&quot;<br />
<br />
Linda looked at him. &quot;Oh poor guy. I&#39;ll get you cleaned up. Now come over to the changing table.&quot;<br />
<br />
He toddled over. She picked him up. She opened his diaper bag pulling out a few diapers, his size 4 diaper from earlier and a pullup. <br />
&quot;Mommy said if I don&#39;t wet I stay in puww up&quot;<br />
<br />
Since he was trying to be independent again, the curse decided it was going to make things worse.<br />
&quot;Yes, she did and I&#39;m so proud of you. I only have the diaper out in case you pee. Remember how much you like that? You pee almost as much as you did when you were a little baby.&quot;<br />
He became a bit embarassed. She opened his pull-up and started using it to get as much poop off his butt . He felt the dirty pull up touch his balls and his sensitivity to it made him erect again. She started wiping his butt down with wipes before discarding them. She then proceeded to his testicles wiping them down of all the poop. She next powdered him. At that moment he felt a familiar warmth. He wasnt aware yet but he started shrinking. She looked down at him and giggled. <br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s not going to pee right?&quot;<br />
He nodded. She started pulling the pull-up between his legs. As soon as the pull-up was slid on his groin he felt the release. His penis started spurting a bunch of pee. He felt his face , head, and chest get peed on as he laid on his back. He started crying loudly. He didn&#39;t realize yet the changes hitting him. His body continued shrinking and growing baby fat as he went from a 3 years old toddler to pudgy a year old baby. The pull-up thickened, became white, and separated into an untaped large size 4 diaper. The curse decided to make things worse for Johnny as he couldn&#39;t stop peeing and he soon found it pooling around his body. He started to flail a bit in tantrum. Lisa tried to calm him down while wiping him down quickly with wet wipes<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sweetie, I didn&#39;t tape your diapey on quick enough. I know these are a size up for you but they should hold as much pee as possible. You should grow into them soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The curse was doing the opposite for him making him smaller and putting him into a size too big. He looked over to his side. The final moment of transformation hit him when he looked over and saw his wet pull-up turn into a size four diaper and some of the diapers get smaller and turn to size 3. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m big boy in puww ups&quot; he cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you are way too young for that. You&#39;re only a year old Baby Johnny. We got you in big boy diapers though. You&#39;ll grow into them&quot; she chuckled.<br />
<br />
Lisa proceeded to tape up his diaper he should have messed. He was so small for the bulky diaper that instead of being taped around his waist, it was covering his belly button. The tapes even touched. He tried to put his legs together and found it was way too big for him to even get his knees together. He thought maybe he&#39;d try to dress himself in a size smaller or ask Lisa soon. Lisa picked him up and put him on the ground. Everything was a bit bigger than before. She put everything back into his diaper bag, picked it up, and Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s get to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Class? Johnny gulped afraid.</p>
