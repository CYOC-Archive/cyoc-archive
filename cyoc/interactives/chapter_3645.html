<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sat their in his desk thinking about what he should change first. &quot;I know&quot; and with that Mr. Milhaud felt his pants tightening on his legs. &quot;Huh?&quot; he thought. Ty continued until his slacks were at the tearing point. &quot;Don't wanna  get too extreme for class....yet&quot; He thought. Next was his back which had started to widen with every breath Milhaud took. His shirt started to pull tight against his chest which TY now had started on it. Milhaud's shirt was becoming very tight and uncomfortable but their was nothing he could do. He didn't know what was happening. The buttons were at the snapping point when Ty made his chest and back stop and started the arms. All Milhaud could do is sit their and try to remain calm in front of his class. Ty made sure that everyone continued doing their work like everything was normal. For the moment that is. 
<br />

<br />
Milhaud looked down at his forearms to see his veins start snakeing up and down his arms. His arms were starting to swell to  a good 20 inches when Ty removed the hold from the rest of his body. The sleeves were the first to go as his arms started to accelerate in growth. The back of his shirt was as tight as it could get when right down the center it tore. The buttons on the front of the shirt fired of from top to bottom as if it was a small machine gun. His slacks now tight as can be tore from his thighs, His calves following suit. Ty sat their with a grin on his face as he brought his teachers chest to a very larg and tight 55 inches. His arms looked  to 30 inches. Ty decided that would be suffecient for the teacher. His thighs had to be at least 70 inches and calves that were to freaky to be ignored. Ty turned his concetration to another body part of Mr. Milhaud's. Instead of just enlarging it he decided to  see if any kids would notice the sounds coming from the teacher. Ty willed the teachers dick to become hard. He wasn't very large for a 30ish year old man, but that startted to change.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh no, please not here, at least not in class&quot; Milhaud thought. Ty started to swell it up, at first he started slowly but then hit it with some serious speed. It was growing so fast that Milhaud moaned out loud. Ty trying not to laugh made it swell more and harder. It was now passing the size of a liter bottle when ty stopped the increase in size. Milhaud realizing that he moaned out loud was looking around with a look of horror on his face to see if anyone was looking. No had noticed yet. His dick then started to heave up wards towards him. The slacks already streching out in the crotch hit their stopping point. It was starting to become painful as his dick forced it's way threw the material. His button flew off and stuck in the ceiling as the zipper got yanked down by his growing manhood. Ty allowed his underwear to strech and adjust to his growing rod. As his dick came to stop, his testiceles inflated fast to softball size. Their he sat, clothes torn to shreads, weighing in at a good 300 and sporting the biggest hard on he had ever seen. When he looked up he realized all his students were stareing at him.
<br />

<br />
Milhaud, in absolute terror was able to speak the words &quot;class dismissed.&quot; He didn't know what to say or do. He had no answers as to why this happened. Not that he didn't like it but he was going to loose his job he thought. The students with a look of dumbfounded on thier face's got up and started exiting the room. Ty playing along walked out thinking that he may have picked a bad place to do that to him. Upon his decesion, he mad sure he was the last one out of the room. As he stepped out into the hall he wiped the other students thoughts of seeing any of that. He then made Mr. Milhaud loose alot of his size but not all of it, he also willed his clothes back together and back on him. Mr. Milhaud stood their  with the look of &quot;duh&quot; on his face.
<br />

<br />
Ty wanted to find Dustin to see what they might do next.</p>
