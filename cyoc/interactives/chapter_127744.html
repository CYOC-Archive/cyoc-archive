<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While <i>Moon Lake, Andersons</i> and <i>Moon Lake, Jenkins</i> are still on the day before at the moment, it&#39;s Monday November 2, 2015 to the events and people in this story line...<br />
<br />
It was quitting time for the day shift at a famous Seattle, Washington newspaper.<br />
After conferring with his counterpart on the night shift, the editor on duty secured his computer and prepared to go home to his wife, confident that another edition was well on its way to being published.<br />
As he started to leave, the editor spotted reporter Tom Herald still at his desk.<br />
<br />
“Tom,” began the editor, while approaching the reporter. “It’s after 5. I didn’t think you’d have that story about the current status of police departments done before deadline.”<br />
“You’re right. There’s a lot more work involved than either of us thought,” agreed the reporter. “I do have an appointment to meet with a representative of Seattle PD tomorrow, and a lot of the departments I contacted by phone said they’d get back to me. Probably wanting to confirm my ID and purpose in calling them first before they speak on the record about their records.”<br />
“Reasonable,” conceded the editor.<br />
“But something else caught my attention while I was working,” began Tom, which made his editor pause.<br />
As politely as it could be phased, in the past Tom Herald was known to go off on “flights of fancy”. Chasing the proverbial wild geese and impossible tales, like the recent incident where suspect Lionel Ulysses allegedly grew a rat’s tail when shot. It wasn’t the first windmill Herald tilted at with Don Quixote like zeal, but if only Tom could be that adamant obtaining the truth all the time on just the hard news stories instead of trying to prove things that went ‘bump’ in the night were real…<br />
<br />
The editor dreaded asking, but still had to know. “What?”<br />
“Guess who’s throwing his hat into the ring in hopes of becoming the next President of the United States?” asked Tom, while pointing at his computer screen.<br />
“You’re kidding,” replied the editor, even as he read the article from an accredited source for himself.<br />
“I wish I was. Right now, I don’t think he has a snowball’s survival rate in hell of being elected, but still...”<br />
“Well, whatever happens, it will certainly make 2016 an interesting election year,” conceded the editor.<br />
“Which reminds me...” began Tom, wondering how to ask what he really wanted.<br />
“Yes?” said the editor, dreading the thought of the other shoe dropping and Tom Herald going off on some wild goose chase after all.<br />
“When I’m done with this police departments story, would you consider transferring me to the political beat?”<br />
The editor had to stop and think about that one. There was no denying that Tom Herald was one hell of a reporter. Yet if he thought something… unnatural might be involved, the man would not rest until he found proof, no matter how weird or outlandish the situation might be; which was why Tom was recently reassigned to the Sports department for a while to give him (and everyone else at the paper) a break after the Ulysses situation.<br />
<i>Then again, if Tom can stay focused, that zeal for the truth might be just what our political coverage needs...</i><br />
“Tell you what,” began the editor, “if we don’t already have that covered,” he said, pointing at Tom’s computer screen, “write up a brief article that he’s announced his attentions, then call it a night. When the police department story is done, we’ll discuss your request further,” he promised.<br />
“Okay. Night boss,” said Tom, as the editor resumed leaving.<br />
Yet as Tom started honoring his superior’s request, he couldn’t help thinking, <i>If that guy can run, why not a were someday? But is the world ready for fur awareness?</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, BACK IN MOON LAKE…<br />
Jen Decker was lost in thought in the master bedroom of her home.<br />
She was mixing and matching outfits for her upcoming job interviews. Going over each appointment in her head, planning what to say and wondering–if the opportunity presented itself–which position to choose if more than one potential employer wanted to hire her.<br />
Yet there was one other thing on her mind too.<br />
Claire Jacobs, the lady Jen recently ushered into were society, making her a sister werecat and possibly falling in love with the woman too while doing so.<br />
<i>I have no doubts about my feelings for her, but are they just from the heat of the moment since I sired Claire, or is what I’m feeling for her true? And if the latter is real, is it too soon after losing my husband?</i><br />
That was the unanswered question that had to be put on hold as Jen heard her front doorbell ring.<br />
Stopping what she was in the middle of, Jen went to answer the ringing. She knew it couldn’t be her son Tad, for he had his own key. <i>Is it….</i><br />
Jen’s heart literally seemed to skip a beat as she opened the door and saw Claire standing before her.<br />
“I hope I’m not early or interrupting something,” began the other woman, as Jen let her in.<br />
“No. I wasn’t sure when you’d be back today, since I’m not familiar with your work schedule, but I do have your outfit washed and dried for you.”<br />
“Thanks, but you didn’t have to go to all that trouble,” replied Claire.<br />
“No problem. Would you like to sit down? Maybe stay for dinner?” asked Jen. <i>The rest of the night too?</i> she silently hoped.<br />
“Yeah. I’d like to chat, if you don’t mind. There’s been something on my mind all day that I’d like to talk to you about,” revealed Claire, as she took the offered seat on the couch.<br />
Jen sat down next to her new friend and indicated she was all ears.<br />
<br />
“This is kind of hard for me to talk about, so please bear with me,” began Claire, staring at Jen.<br />
Jen just nodded and waited for Claire to say whatever was on her mind.<br />
“What you’ve done for me has been the greatest gift I could ever imagine. The fulfillment of a life long dream,” said Claire. “Now, I know I haven’t been a werecat, let alone a full fledged <i>lesbian</i> werecat for very long, so I sincerely hope I’m not out of line with what I’m about to say.”<br />
Now it was Jen’s turn to stare at Claire as the other woman paused to gather her thoughts.<br />
“Jen...” finally said Claire, taking Decker’s hands in hers. “I’ve been in relationships before, but never one like whatever it is we have between us. I… I don’t know if I have the right to say this to you right now, since we’ve only known each other for less than 48 hours, but I love you,” she declared. “It’s probably way too soon to discuss any long term plans between us. Like maybe me moving in, let alone the two of us spending the rest of our lives together as a happily married couple, but—”<br />
And that was the last word Claire Jacobs would say for quite a while that evening, as Jen Decker leaped upon the woman, passionately kissing her even as Jen rapidly assumed her werecat fursona and started furiously undressing Claire.<br />
Jacobs didn’t waste a moment following suit, and soon two werecats in love were embraced on the Decker household’s living room floor, physically expressing their romantic emotions toward each other.</p>
