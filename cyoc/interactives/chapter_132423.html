<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    “Slar, I need you to listen to us, if only for a moment.”<br />
<br />
   Slar, with lightning speed whipped out his shotgun and already had it aimed directly at the monsters head before it was even done speaking.<br />
<br />
  Mary was beside the monster, appearing to be completely unharmed and had a slightly annoyed look on her face, most likely because of the monster’s crazy antics.<br />
<br />
    How did it know my name? More importantly, it can speak? It doesn’t matter Slar thought, keeping his aim steady at the monster.<br />
<br />
  “Freeze monster. Doesn’t matter how many bullets it takes, I’ll shoot you down no matter what.” Slar threatened, aiming his shotgun with only one hand. He knew his bullets would do nothing to the monster, so instead, with his free hand, he discreetly was preparing to test out his new weapon, the bottomless vacuum.<br />
<br />
  “Slar you’re making a huge mistake, this is a misunderstanding, put down the gun and legs talk.” the monster replied, it’s voice was gravellly, like hard cloud chunks grating down a mountain.<br />
<br />
  “The only mistake here is you, and right now you’re chained up with the woman, let me end your life now so I can get her free from those cuffs.” Slar demanded cooling, making sure to give the beast his classic cold eye. The vacuum was ready to suck, all Slar needed was an opening now.<br />
<br />
  “Slar, you’re acting like a child, please calm down now.” Mary pleaded, her voice tinged with a hint of annoyance.<br />
   <br />
<br />
   Slar ignored her, Mary herself was likely trying to use the situation as an advantage. Slar knew she hadn’t fully committed herself to joining the Gang , which meant she would probably look for any opportunity to escape. <br />
<br />
    Instead of responding with his voice, like any true hero, Slar responded with his gun. Pulling the trigger, his hand jerked slightly as he delivered a shotgun blast aimed directly at the monster’s head. The loud noise ringing in his ear as the bullets directly hit home, not that it matter.<br />
<br />
     Although the bullets had penetrated the monsterms head, he could already see it start to reform back.<br />
<br />
  Using that chance, Slar activated his vacuum. However, his unfamiliarity with the device cause him to make a slight mistake. Instead of pushing the “Suck” button, Slar instead pushed the  “Blow” button, and in a second, Slar realized his whole body was jerking around as the vacuumed thrashed around in his hand, barely under his control.<br />
<br />
   Shooting out all of the lab equipment, materials, and experiments in an  outward torrent of wind, Slar watched as Mary grabbed a discarded gem embedded shield on the floor beside her, using it to protect herself whilst the monster could only lift up his four arms and ready it’s black armor to protect himself.<br />
<br />
     Slar grinned as he watched the monster take the brunt of the force whilst Mary, using her superior cloudfolk dexterity and shield managed to get through with only a couple scraps... the monster however, had a much less pleasant experience.<br />
<br />
   Slar could only feel pride as the vacuum thrashed around in his hands like a wild beast, only barely managing to turn it off and set it on the ground, the flow of items and equipment stopping as he watched the monster get assualted by all manner of objects. Dangerous looking lab equipment stabbed into his body, sticking out and piercing into the softer parts of his body, whilst strange liquids originally contained in now broken vials and beakers burned away at the harder parts of his body, causing Issac to screech in pain as the numerous chemicals reacted together, causing parts of his body to ignite in a green chemical fire that consumed and even melted parts of his body. Slar could even see a couple of parasites and strange organic things, completely forge in to the Cloud Plane dig into him.<br />
<br />
  The monster gave out a satisfying roar of pain, and Slar mentally patted himself on the back for using the vacuum.<br />
<br />
   Mary, upon hearing Issac’s screams, yelled out with concern, dropping the shield and using a nearby cloud cloth to put out some for the fires, doing her best to wipe away the chemicals and pulling out any pieces of lab equipment she could as well and stabbing and removing any of the strange organisms using her sword as well.<br />
<br />
      Slar watched in confusion... why would Mary help an unknown monster... unless she was under some sort of mind control? It was a possibility. Slar had heard stories of strange otherworldly monsters that could infect and plague one’s body and mind with a mere touch. Although strangely enough most of said stories also involved some type of sexual intercourse, though Slar was pretty sure those tales were false. That didn’t discount the fact that Mary was clearly helping what could only be an enemy right now. <br />
<br />
    Even now, Slar could see that the monster was starting to recover. All of the chemical fires had been put out and wiped away whilst most of the monster’s body was already starting to regenerate, pushing out any pieces of lab equipment stuck in its body. Slar couldn’t let that continue. He had to end this quickly or else he would be back at square one soon enough. Perhaps he could persuade the monster to give up it’s life? That would deal with the chains and Mary being controlled all at once!<br />
<br />
     “Now if you think that’s all I have to offer, then you’re wrong. Give up monster and let me kill you.”<br />
<br />
   The monster only groaned in reply as it tried to stand up, Mary doing her best to support his weight.<br />
<br />
        When the monster hadgained enough strength to stand, it only barley on its own, Mary turned to face Slar. Drawing out her sword, Mary with a face of true genuine annoyance asked aloud with a cold voice “Slar  are you really this idiotic? Let him be and calm down, if only for a moment!”<br />
<br />
  “No can do, that things a monster and if my hunch is correct, then the only reason why you’re helping him is because he’s controlling you.” Slar stated cooly, cautiously moving the aim of his shotgun to Mary.<br />
       <br />
    Mary gave a look of confusion for a moment, as if unsure what she had heard before realization dawned on her and her annoyed face came back with full force.<br />
<br />
  “Slar, please don’t tell me that’s what you came up with?” She asked, her voice sounding exasperated.<br />
<br />
  “The look on your face tells me I’m right, now give up and let me kill that thing. Or not, despite whatever I might of said before, I’ll kill you if I have to.” <br />
<br />
  Mary gave another look and was about to speak, before calming herself down, taking a deep breath as she said. <br />
<br />
  “Slar, you are a writer are you not?”<br />
<br />
 “What’s that got to do with anything?” Slar asked, keeping an eye on his surrounding as he spoke, who knows what the mentally dominated Mary could be planning to do.<br />
<br />
 “Because tell me, what kind of writer writes a protagonist who shoots first, jumps to conclusions with no tangible evidence, and is unwilling to calm down and have a peaceful talk without pointing a weapon at someone?” Mary stated.<br />
<br />
      Slar still kept his shotgun aimed at Mary, even as he saw the monster rise up. Although it’s body was mostly healed up, it was still clearly in some amount of pain, it’s upper arms clutched its head, visibly shaking as it inaudible mumbled to itself, as if in its own private conversation. Parts of its body and armor had still not fully recovered, although Slar noted that the strange halo that floated above it’s head was strangely unharmed.<br />
<br />
     Mary briefly looked at the monster with concern in her eyes before turning back to Slar.<br />
<br />
  “Now please, put down the gun and let’s talk for at least a moment. You can shoot at us all you want later, but please give us a chance to talk without whatever that thing is aimed at us.” Mary pleaded.<br />
<br />
     Slar still kept his aim at Mary, deep in thought about what to do. He was shocked, for some reason he was actually considering putting down his weapon. Perhaps it had to do with some subtle mental domination spell the monster was trying to cast? He didn’t know, and he for sure knew it wasn’t because Mary’s words had actually struck a cord with him and was beginning to slowly realize that he was unnecessarily escalating a situation far higher than it needed to be.<br />
<br />
  With a deep breath, Slar pondered what to do for a moment, before slowly lowering his gun as...</p>
