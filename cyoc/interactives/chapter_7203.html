<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slam bang went Pete as he ran into the barn. A bull stood groaning it's fate as the bands tightened above his jewels. Pete jumped into the stall which scared Paco half out of his wits. Bellowing like the bull he was a lowered head, stomping and pawing hooves were ready for attack.<br />
<br />
Pete knowing the power behind those horns scrambled about in the filthy straw about the stall. A reach of his right arm and the click from a switchblade took the bands off. Paco did not understand Pete's intentions and by what he saw thought he was soon to be just one of the boys.<br />
<br />
Mister Moreno came running into the barn just as Pete flew bye.<br />
<br />
A snorting bull stood giving the intruder his personal disgust as Pete picked himself up oof the barn floor. &quot;It's done Mister Moreno, his bands are off and I think he'll be OK as a sire.&quot; said Pete brushing off his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to be more careful with big animals like that one! You get injured being so rash and I got to pay the medical bills! Now when your ready take our runaway cow back to the pasture and this time LOCK the gate shut!&quot; ordered Mister Moreno.<br />
<br />
Pete Hamilton had worked for the old man now these past six years. Never had he been hollared at by the boss till today, maybe it was because that bull seemed to put the fear of God into him.<br />
<br />
Mister Moreno watched the cow swing her tail with every step as Pete took her in tow. Breathing heavy from all that had occured this day he reached into his pocket for a handkerchief and out dropped the Amulet. A wipe of the sweat from his brow as he bent over to pick up the bright bobble.<br />
<br />
Looking at the wierd find he then watched as Pete clipped a pad lock on the pasture gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Poppo!&quot; called a well known voice of Mister Moreno's Jiggabo' son Alejandro Moreno.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you talk to your Father don't call him Poppo! You silly faddango fool, look at you the oversized clothes, pant cuffs dragging in the dirt, and that 20 gallon sombraro tops the idot well! What do you want anyway?&quot; chidded the master of his house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Father, I'm going to the County Fair with Maylene Calanda, you loan me twenty bucks?&quot; asked Alejandro.<br />
<br />
A cold scowl looked back at the 23 year old man acting like a 17 year old brat. Mister Moreno knew it was easier to pay off rather than be plauged with the fool's whinning. As he dug out his wallet he watched his silly son dance about with glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty bucks wasted!&quot; said Mister Moreno as he walked into the barn. Fumbling hands dropped the wallet as he tried to push it back into the pants pocket. Then bending down to pick it up the Amulet fell to the gorund too. A silliy high pitched giggle of his son outside, the fumbling action of old hands, a wallet, a bright bobble, and bending over reminded him of his years of work and how that stupid son was always a real pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn idiot, Alejandro, he'd been better off born an Ass then he'd look the way he acts day after day!&quot; grumbled Mister Moreno.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that Boss?&quot; said Pete who by now was standing right behind the old man.<br />
<br />
Returning to standing up as he was startled by Pete's comment Mister Moreno turned to look directly at Pete. &quot;Not talking to you, just mad about the family idiot! I just made a wish that Alejandro would have been better born a Ass, since he acts like one every day anyway. Yup, he should have been some poor farmer's lazy Ass as tonight he'll act like a stud with some silly female. Oh come'on Pete he's got me so damn mad!&quot; grumbled Mister Moreno.<br />
<br />
Deep in his pants pocket beamed the Amulet as the pickup truck which Alejandro was driving toward town slowed, turning toward the drainage ditch where it came to a stop.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at Mesto Farms in the near County of Flanders a new male Ass pranced around in the pasture. The hardy beast of 10 hands high tried to get his bearings as just moments ago he was driving down US.66 going to meet this evenings date.<br />
<br />
Almost time for diner when a tow truck and Police car rolled into the farm's driveway. Mister Moreno took one look and expected the worst. As his wife and children piled out of the house they all came to stand behind Mister Moreno.<br />
<br />
The Policeman told how the empty vehicle was found in a roadside ditch. The report told of no driver found, but these clothes were inside the cab along with a 20 gallon straw hat. The keys were still in the ignition, motor running, but Alejandro was nowhere in sight.<br />
<br />
The weeping of a Mother was comforted by her children as Mister Moreno pointed where to have the truck parked. Pete stood off by the barn watching the Peyton Place draman unfold. &quot;Dumb kid, who gives a shit what happened to him!&quot; Pete said under his breathe but just loud enough for the Boss to give him a dirty look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Pete what you say about my Alejandro?&quot; hollared Mister Moreno.<br />
<br />
Pete blushed as he knew the Boss was already hot under the collar and with his comment would no doubt fire him. &quot;I'm sorry Boss but you always are upset with the kid, heck you a few hours ago wished he was born a dumb Ass since he acted like one all the time!&quot; said Pete.<br />
<br />
The old man was steamed, &quot;You think you better than my Alejandro! You grown man, but you no have as many girlfriends as my Alejandro, why is that? Yea, you work here and help out good! He gon'a be a true stud among women, maybe I wish you had his kind of sexappeal! Yea I wish Mister Peter Hamilton have the pretty ladies chase him like my Alejandro has right now!&quot; argued Mister Moreno as he turned quickly and walked toward the house.<br />
<br />
Again the bright Amulet glowed as Pete Hamilton doubled over to his knees in agony.</p>
