<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary looks at the claw. It&#39;s a piece of gummy candy she received earlier. It&#39;s deep solid blue color stands out sharply against the ruby palm of the dragonness who claims to be her father. She takes it from her and analyzes it. As she rolls it between her thumb and index finger, she realizes it&#39;s gummy and oddly resistant to being squished and squeezed. It feels warm, yet retains its molding, without feeling sticky. Mary looks back-up at the dragoness&#39;s snout.<br />
<br />
The ruby serpent lady&#39;s hands have gone to her wide hips. She&#39;s smiling menacingly, perhaps in a way to intimidate Mary. It works, and Mary breaks eye-contact, turning her head towards the other dragon. The amber dragon seems to have realized the situation and is also staring directly at Mary. However, instead of menace or intimidation, the amber dragon&#39;s amber eyes appear to be filled with lust and want. Her body is also seems to be growing in desire, with perky tits and quivering vagina. She&#39;s also body-blocking the only exit, and appears to be as powerful as she is horny. This does not fill Mary with confidence, so she turns back and looks down in her hand at the blue dragon-shaped candy.<br />
<br />
Mary feels helpless and unable to escape the situation she&#39;s in. She reluctantly raises the candy to her mouth, and pops it in. She can practically feel the eyes of the ruby and amber dragonesses light up as she does this. Mary chews slowly, letting the blue-berry flavor linger in her mouth. She eyes the ruby dragoness and swallows, who practically chirrs in delight, which is a much different reaction than what Mary was expecting.<br />
<br />
No sooner had she swallowed, she began to feel butterflies in her stomach. Her stomach makes an audible gurgle, and then to Mary&#39;s shock, the sound of a fire igniting! She felt it too. It was unbelievably hot, yet tolerable. Even so, Mary couldn&#39;t help but hold her stomach and crouch over slightly. This made the other two dragons back away from her. The amber dragon moves to be next to the ruby dragon, who moves behind the counter. Mary still watches them and can&#39;t help but feel worried at the sudden defensiveness. Then, the feeling of heat inside here ramps up, causing her to close her eyes at the intensity.<br />
<br />
The heat wasn&#39;t just in her head. All at once her clothes ignite, sizzling everything that could be. Her pink t-shirt, her pajama bottoms, slippers, and panties all turn to ash within a few seconds. Mary would&#39;ve been embarrassed, being naked in the kitchen, had the heat not rocketed into her head. Immediately, as soon as her hair singed off, four thick horns push out of her scalp and back, giving her a menacing appearance. Her nose, jaw and mouth push forward, becoming mythologically serpentine. At the same time, shiny, navy-blue scales erupt from her scalp from her horns. It takes no time at all for them to cover her, changing it as they climbed down. Her jaw grows draconic and powerful, capable of crushing bone. It clicks in place, allowing Mary to move and use her new dragon maw. She opens her eyes wide and gasps for air with her new mouth and dragon nostrils. Her teeth appear razor sharp, and her tongue is slightly parted. Her eyes slitted, and amber like her mother&#39;s. Her head now looks like both her parents, completely dragon, but thicker and more masculine. However, the flame didn&#39;t travel back down to her gullet yet. Instead it imparted a strong, and heavy desire into her mind. It finally went back down her throat, but not before Mary could feel lust welling up inside her.<br />
<br />
As the feeling of heat comes back down through her neck, it changes it as well. Mary looks down at herself, she can see and feel her neck growing longer. Before it stops, Mary sees the floor drop away by a few inches. Then, another intense heat grows, and her neck bulks up quickly. Both her head and neck now look very formidable and naturally intimidating. The dragons behind the counter chirp in approval. <br />
<br />
The fire moves to her center and splits in four, moving to her extremities. Quickly, her arms bulk up as muscle explodes. Her hands grow thick, capped with thick, ebony colored claws. The scales have covered her entire body at this point, and flex nicely with her new muscles. Her legs get a similar treatment as they too bulk up, except her heels move up her legs, causing her height to increase more. Her toes lengthen into strong talons, capable of maintaining balance at any angle. Mary would be freaking out, had she not been fighting the encroaching lusty thoughts that the flame had left her to ponder. However, as she was lost in a thought-battle, she was brought back when her entire torso felt like it was being held over a volcano&#39;s mouth. She opens her eyes again, and cranes her powerful neck down to look at herself. <br />
<br />
The heat then suddenly changed for her. It didn&#39;t feel like heat anymore. It felt like pleasure. Mary&#39;s draconic tongue lolls out of her mouth as she watches her breasts shrink and reform into wide pectorals. She&#39;s conflicted, as she always liked her boobs, yet the new pecs felt better. Mary sucks in air through her snout as she grows toned, with a six-pack moving in underneath her new pectorals. Mary feels a tug, which causes her to stumble back against the kitchen wall, which groans heavily against her increasing mass. She looks down at the floor, and sees that she&#39;s at least four feet taller! The tug returns a second time, and Mary watches as a thick, long, blue-scaled dragon tail snakes from behind her all the way to the floor, with each vertebrae twitching as Mary is able to use them. It looks as long as she is. She looks at the two in wonder. They don&#39;t meet her gaze however, as they&#39;re transfixed at her crotch.<br />
<br />
Mary looks down to meet where their gaze is pointing and is immediately flush with pleasure. She watches her clitoris, pulsing. With each pulse it grows longer and thicker, and ever more pleasurable. Mary can barely lean against the wall as her new penis sways into the open kitchen air. It&#39;s larger than she&#39;s ever seen. If she had to guess it was a good twenty inches, and as thick as a can. She twitches involuntarily as it brushes against a cool breeze. Just then, another intense pleasure overtakes the area underneath her monster. Her vagina seals up and the lips begin to push out. Two weighty balls plop into the lips and help inflate them until they&#39;re very clearly a ball sack. Both testicles keep growing, straining against her taint. They twitch as well, growing until they&#39;re as big as the palms of her new dragon hands. Then, with more pleasure for Mary, they drop completely and slap against his thigh. <br />
<br />
Mary, flushed, looks back at the other two serpents again. They&#39;re transfixed on his new appendage. Likewise, Mary is transfixed on them. Where they were frightening before to him, he now sees them as a wonderful opportunity to get some. Mary, aware of his lust, grabs his dick and stands up, to face the two women. It twitches heavily in his grasp, and the pleasure clouds his mind even further.<br />
<br />
He has can&#39;t fight it anymore, he has to fuck something, be it himself or them. He looks at them, slowly stroking himself to ease his lust. Both Robert and Melissa wait watch the huge, blue anthro dragon, waiting on its authority.</p>
