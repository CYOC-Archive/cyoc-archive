<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Are you regretting buying those goth outfits yesterday, Charlotte? Or do you prefer Cordelia instead?” “To answer your first question, no. As for the second one, I’m back to being normal Charlotte.” Charlotte paused while she looked down at herself, rubbing the newest change on her this morning. “Well, not completely normal.” <br />
The clothes that Cordelia got for Charlotte were a little too big in the bust and hip departments. Granted, they can still work for now as long as she has some rubber bands and a belt to hold them down. Instead, Charlotte was more worried about this new change that those little machines had done to her.<br />
<br />
Not caring about what her next transformation may bring, Charlotte, who was Cordelia at the time, went to bed early for the night. Even when Nancy tried her hardest to witness the next change, Cordelia just closed the door behind her and pushed in the lock on the door for privacy.<br />
Then, like clockwork for the past few days, the nanomachines begin their work at the stroke of midnight. They started with Charlotte’s color pallet, returning to her tanned looks and brunette hair. Then all the extra mass that was in her chest and ass has reduced back to her regular modest size as before. The final change that the robots had done is to affect her mind, removing her gothic opinions on things but keeping the memories of what happens<br />
<br />
But then, as if to spite Charlotte for having a thin torso throughout all those transformations, the nanomachines blew Charlotte’s belly up. It started with a soft growl, unheard in the bedroom with one inhabitant. Then it started to shift and move outward, pushing back Cordelia’s newly brought, black PJ shirt. Its size began to gain some heft as it grew to about a pregnant woman and then some more, forcing the sleeping form of Charlotte to sleep on her side.<br />
<br />
Just when Charlotte’s belly seemed like it could break her bed, the growth stopped. Its size easily overshadowed Charlotte&#39;s, it spans as far up to her breasts and down to her feet. With the farthest point in the middle of her chubby belly making her wider than she is tall, it is easy to say that she is more belly than their owner. As for Charlotte, she was sound asleep throughout the whole expansion. Even rubbed her gigantic middle in her sleep as if she had always had this belly.<br />
So when the woman woke up from her nap in the morning, not as Cordelia but as Charlotte, she screamed her head off. Nancy, having woken up by her friend’s screams, rushes out of the pull-out couch that she was sleeping in. But thanks to Cordelia for locking the door last night, Nancy couldn’t open the door. And since she has spontaneously gained 100s of pounds overnight on a body part that is bigger than her, Charlotte couldn’t get up to unlock the door. <br />
<br />
One bent paperclip, a dolly with blankets on it, and a lot of heavy lifting between the two ladies later, Charlotte is mobile again. Even if her belly spans across her vision below her and the weight is almost too heavy to push, dolly included, Charlotte is still mobile. Clothed in one of her newest purchases when she was in her goth phase yesterday, a tank top and long skirt which are both black and loose on her, Charlotte began to settle into her newest change of the day.<br />
<br />
While Charlotte’s belly may look like she is heavily pregnant with an army, a few strong pokes and rubs show that it is all fat. Nancy walked around Charlotte’s middle, typing into her laptop to document this change. “You know, once this hits the market, there will be a lot of people who will be giving their right arm to lose some weight.” Charlotte was about to say some colorful words at Nancy for bringing up weight loss while she looked like this until Nancy quickly followed up her statement.<br />
 “Yes, I know that it sounds mean to say that while you look like you won a food-eating contest but think of it as this. If I can find the programming that caused this, I can reverse the function and treat it as a weight-loss program when I release it to the public. Then again, other people out there will also love it just as it is, a weight-gain program.”<br />
<br />
Charlotte looked down at herself again, wondering why would anyone want to be a big, helpless ball of lard who needed help to do anything. “I don’t think people would buy this stuff to fatten themselves up or anyone else for that matter,” Charlotte wondered out loud. Nancy hopped on the nearby chair next to the mountainous belly to see the top of Charlotte’s belly, still typing away. “Charlotte, there are huge followings behind fat women. Such women who gained their fame and money due to their increasing measurements.”<br />
<br />
Nancy stopped typing on her computer and then, without telling Charlotte, jumped on top of her belly. Charlotte felt her friend moving around on top of her belly, impossible for her to reach up to get Nancy off of her dome. As for Nancy, she felt that her friend’s belly would make for a better bed than the pull-out couch. The warmness and soft feeling of her flesh, the slight give it has while she pushes it down to adjust herself while it still holds her up, and how much space she has to roll around on.<br />
Nancy managed to make her way to her friend’s flustered face, fuming at her friend for basically treating her as a mattress or a trampoline to play around on. “Get. Off. Me!” angrily shouted Charlotte, whose flailing arms were trying to grab her friend who was a little too far from her to reach. Nancy just smiled at her attempt and said, “But you feel so comfortable up here. Are you sure I can’t stay here? “NOW!!” “Okay, okay, Charlotte. Don’t have a…” The look that Charlotte gave made Nancy slide off the most comfortable spot in the house.<br />
<br />
“Okay, that was a poor choice of word there. My bad.” Charlotte just kept looking at her friend, still upset at her for jumping on top of her. “Say, to make it up for you, how about I make something for us to eat?” “Well, I am a little hungry at the moment. So yes, please.” “Hungry enough to eat a horse?” Nancy said before ducking a shoe that was aimed at her face and quickly ran into the kitchen to start making something to eat.</p>
