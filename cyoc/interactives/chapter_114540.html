<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Exactly eight minutes went by before Marino came downstairs.  He looked like a strange mix of Demon and Human.  He was wearing just a vest for a shirt, mainly to keep out of the way of his wings, and a nice pair of jeans with sneakers.  If he didn&#39;t have his demonic features, he could have passed for a teenage athlete.  You, on the other hand, had a much more sinister appearance to you.  You were wearing your long, black robes, with your wings popping out of the back.  You felt that you needed a bit of a wardrobe change, but now was not the time.  &quot;I didn&#39;t lie, did I?&quot;  Marino asked, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;  You chuckled.  &quot;So, souls.  We&#39;re both hungry.  Let&#39;s find some lunch.&quot;  It was about midnight in the Gadnar household, located in Malibu, California.  (I am crazy when it comes to attention to detail/making sure there are no contradictions in my chapters.  I actually looked up places within a 30 mile radius of Pasadena because of small things I mentioned in previous chapters...)  &quot;Do you want to scan, for lack of a better term, for souls, or should I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t get better if you do, so I think I should try.&quot;  Marino replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;A very mature answer.&quot;  You smiled happily, seeing the motivation Marino had to become a stronger demon.  &quot;Do you see anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on.&quot;  Marino&#39;s violet eyes were slightly blue, showing that he was focusing on looking for souls.  &quot;I found a group of about 6 souls close by.  They&#39;re some greens and some purples.  Nothing too spectacular, but there are a lot.  Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Sometimes, quantity trumps quality.&quot;  You smiled, exposing your sharp canine teeth.  &quot;Where are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About, um...  10 miles away.&quot;  Marino replied slowly, trying to get an exact read on these souls.  &quot;Not too far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;  You smiled as you snapped your fingers, turning invisible to everything, except for Marino.  Marino followed suit.  The two of you walked out of the front door, which was far out of the sight of anything, so nobody could see the front door seemingly open on its own.  Once the two of you were outside, you flew up into the air towards your lunches.<br />
<br />
During this fly, you decided to make Marino fly as fast as he could.  Even though it was too short to be useful training, you wanted to anyway.  Even though his last fly was at Mach 3, this time, he pushed closer to Mach 4.  After a very short flight, you made it to a house, where a group of people were sitting in a circle.  It looked like a small get together.  After one more second, Marino arrived.  &quot;Marino, you said that you wanted to see me in action?&quot;  You asked.  &quot;Now&#39;s your chance.  I&#39;m planning on having fun with these people.  Just sit back and watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Dad!&quot;  Marino smiled as he flew into the house and sat on the couch, not dissimilar to when you watched him kill the Killing Couple.  You flew into the house, still invisible.  At this point, you could see why these people obtained these souls.  They were a group of cons who were plotting out their next scam.  Hence the mainly greedy souls.  The purple, uncaring souls were probably because they didn&#39;t care about the fate of their victims, who usually ended up in terrible debts and other situations.  It looked like they had just finished their planning, and were just relaxing and drinking.  While you knew you would have fun, you were not really sure what to do.  However, one of them did something that made you extremely happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have an idea!&quot;  One of them, presumably the owner of the house started.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Chuck?&quot;  Another person, a woman about 42 years old asked.  She was wearing business casual clothing, looking as though she came here right after a dinner or meeting with a client.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just bought this Ouija board.  Let&#39;s try it out!&quot;  Chuck suggested.  This gave you many ideas.  You could also see Marino&#39;s eyes light up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to possess the board, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  Marino asked you telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot;  You responded telepathically.  &quot;This is going to be amazing.&quot;  The group surrounded the board.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve done this before.  We need 2 guys and girls, including myself to hold the thing that goes over the letters.&quot;  One person said.  She was another woman, though younger than the first.  &quot;How about Me, Chuck, Janet and Blake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot;  The other two men asked almost in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d have an imbalance and it wouldn&#39;t work.&quot;  The woman replied.  &quot;Besides, we need someone to get drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot;  One of the men left out scowled.  &quot;Next time, I want in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot;  The woman taking charge raised her voice.  &quot;Now, place your hands on this.&quot;  She said, putting the planchette (the thing that moves.  Yes, I did look that up).  The four people put their hands on the planchette, and she began to speak.  &quot;Hello there spirit.  My name is Angela.  The other people in this room are Blake, Chuck and Janet, who are with me on the Ouija board.  The other two people here, Jordan and Nick, are not participating, but are watching.  Might I ask what your name is?&quot;  You telepathically moved the Planchette to spell &#39;Ral&#39;.  You were going to wait for a bit before killing them.  She was very polite to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!  It moved!&quot;  Chuck yelled.  &quot;Did any of you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chuck, before you screw this up, none of us did.  Plus, only one person is really supposed to ask questions.&quot;  Angela, the woman who knows her Ouija board etiquette, sneered.  &quot;Sorry about that Ral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine Angela.&quot;  You spelled on the board.  &quot;She&#39;s right Chuck.  Bad things can happen to those who misuse Ouija boards.&quot;  That took a long time to spell out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the most talkative spirit I&#39;ve ever talked to on a Ouija board.&quot;  Angela noted.  &quot;I mean that as a compliment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  You spelled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Ral, how many spirits are there in this room, including yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two.&quot;  You spelled out.  &quot;My son is with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting.  Will you son also answer our questions?&quot;  Angela asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  He&#39;s just watching.&quot;  You spelled out to reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much of a talker.&quot;  She asked with a casual chuckle.  &quot;My friend&#39;s son is like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s just not in the mood.&quot;  You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.  Now, one of my favorite questions to ask a spirit.&quot;  She started.  &quot;Are you a good spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s complicated.&quot;  You spelled out.  &quot;I&#39;m not evil, but not good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a new one...&quot;  Angela said, shocked.  &quot;Different subject.  When did you die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean.  I&#39;m still alive.&quot;  You spelled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen this before.&quot;  Angela replied.  &quot;Ouija boards are for channeling the spirits of the dead.  Considering you&#39;re replying through this, you are a spirit of someone who died.  I&#39;ve had spirits in denial before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m alive.  I will show you.&quot;  You spelled out.  Your grin was starting to widen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean show me?&quot;  Angela asked, starting to get worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  Sometimes, bad things happen to those who use Ouija boards, right?&quot;  You asked on the board.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, but those are quite rare.&quot;  Angela started panicking.  &quot;I&#39;ve never had a spirit this interactive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a spirit.&quot;  You replied.  &quot;I&#39;m a demon.&quot;  As soon as you finished spelling the word demon, everyone started to freak out.  They tried to start putting away the Ouija board, scared for their lives.  However, you used your powers to keep the Ouija board from moving off of the table.  &quot;You didn&#39;t set the proper mood, or anything.&quot;  You spelled out.  The eyes of the six cons were glued to the planchette moving without any hands on it.  &quot;Now die.&quot;  You finished.  Immediately, they started to panic.  They were trying to run out of the room, but you closed all of the doors and windows, making sure the blinds were shut.  Once they realized they were trapped, you made yourself visible.  &quot;By the way, I wasn&#39;t lying about my son being here.&quot;  You smiled an evil smile.  &quot;Marino.  You can come out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Kay Dad!&quot;  Marino replied, making himself visible.  &quot;Hi.&quot;  He laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You six people have sinned enough.  It&#39;s time for you all to die.&quot;  You sneered, holding your hands down.  The black aura surrounding your body concentrated by your hands, where a small black orb formed.  &quot;Now, who&#39;s first?&quot;  You looked around the room at the six terrified cons.  &quot;How about you Chuck?  You almost botched the Ouija anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please no sir!&quot;  Chuck yelled.  You made sure no sound would escape the room before, so they could scream as loudly as they wanted.  Nothing would change their fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Lord to you!&quot;  You shouted as you threw the black orb at Chuck.  As soon as it made contact with his body, it exploded into a sea of black energy, surrounding his entire body.  As it did, Chuck&#39;s screams got quieter and quieter, until nothing but his green soul remained.  You telekinetically sent it over to Marino, who would hold the souls until you were done.  That way, you could eat a family meal.  &quot;Now, who&#39;s next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Blake?&quot;  Marino suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why him?&quot;  You turned to your son, perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;  He replied chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point.&quot;  You smiled, waving your hand forward.  Blake started walking towards you, possessed by your powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blake!&quot;  Janet yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t control my body!&quot;  Blake yelled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because I am.&quot;  You smiled.  You raised your hand, causing Blake to rise into the air.  &quot;Warning.  This program contains scenes of a violent nature.  Some may not be able to handle the blood.&quot;  You laughed as you closed your fist, causing Blake to crush into a small ball.  This caused immense pain (for him), and blood to splatter everywhere.  You waved your hand, collecting all of the blood, making a small crimson sphere.  You then created a rift, where you dropped the small blood sphere and the small Blake sphere, sending Blake to hell.  Immediately, his green soul appeared.  You sent that over to Marino as well.  &quot;Now, for the rest of you.&quot;  You held your right hand down, making a large sword of black energy.  It almost looked like a black katana.  You took it in your hand, and rushed to Janet, stabbing her in the heart.  Immediately, her body burst into black flames.  The flames dissolved her body, sending it to hell, only leaving her purple soul.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are those floating balls?&quot;  Jordan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t figured that out.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;They&#39;re the souls of those I&#39;ve killed.  The only reason that you can see them is because I want you to.  Besides, it&#39;s not like anyone here will be surviving, except us immortals.&quot;  You could hear Marino laughing at that one.  &quot;Kids, am I right?&quot;  You asked playfully, raising your katana and cutting Jordan in half.  Just like Janet, his body burst into flames and dissolved, leaving a purple soul.  &quot;Now.  Only two left.&quot;  You made your sword disappear, and calmly walked over to Nick, who was petrified with fear.  Once you were in front of him, you pointed your finger at him.  A small purple bit of energy emanated from it.  You drew a small pentagram in the air with your finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that the symbol of Satan?&quot;  Nick screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Satan doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;  You replied.  &quot;But, in essence, I was Satan, ruler of the Underworld.  The pentagram was always my symbol.  They had almost everything right.  The only things they got wrong were that my name is Ral, not Satan, I&#39;m not a fallen angel or a devil, just a demon, and that I&#39;m not pure evil.  I&#39;m not 100% evil.  I only kill those who have sinned, like you Nick.&quot;  You put your hand down, making the floating purple pentagram attach itself to Nick&#39;s forehead.  Once that was done, you snapped your fingers, making the pentagram explode in black energy, killing Nick and sending him to Hell, leaving only his green soul behind.  &quot;Now, for you Angela.  The leader of this exhibition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Lord, have mercy!&quot;  She screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you asking me for mercy, or your deity?&quot;  You asked condescendingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot;  She cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  You laughed, pointing your hand towards her.  &quot;Goodbye Angela.  It was a fun chat.&quot;  A black aura started to glow from your hand.  After about 5 seconds, you unleashed a strong beam of pure blackness towards Angela, who was vaporized instantly, leaving only a purple soul behind.  &quot;Well that was fun!&quot;  You laughed as you turned to Marino, who was guarding the five other souls.  &quot;Ready for lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot;  Marino smiled.  &quot;Let&#39;s blow this joint!&quot;  You took half of the souls, and flew away, leaving the house seemingly untouched, aside from six people disappearing from the world.<br />
<br />
You arrived back at home, where you would eat your hard earned meal.  &quot;So Marino.  There are three green and three purple.  I&#39;ll take two green and one purple.&quot;  You said.  &quot;You can have the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dad!&quot;  Marino smiled, taking the souls.  As you ate the first green soul, which tasted like a nice, salty chicken soup, you started to wonder something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marino?&quot;  You started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Dad?&quot;  He replied with a mouthful of soul.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see your soul, and the souls of any other living creature.&quot;  You continued.  &quot;But I can&#39;t see my own.  What does it look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s a mixture of black, purple, and gold with horns.&quot;  Marino explained, swallowing his food.  &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a soul quite like yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I noticed back when I was in Falrenkar a while ago, that most demons just have black souls with horns.  Although, your&#39;s is a bit different too.  Before, I just thought it was black with horns like other demons.  However, your&#39;s is a black and dark purple swirl.&quot;  You wondered out loud.  &quot;I wonder why our&#39;s are so different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#39;s because we&#39;re in touch with our demonic powers.&quot;  Marino suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably it.&quot;  You laughed as you continued eating your souls as a small family.  Your fun lasted a bit long, so this lunch was more like linner (between lunch and dinner).  Once you finished your three souls, you made yourself a sandwich to fill yourself up.  Marino did the same.  &quot;Sorry for taking so long.  I was having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was having fun watching you.&quot;  Marino smiled.  &quot;The way you blasted Angela was so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to teach you some of my tricks soon.  For now, relax a bit.  Tomorrow, you&#39;re going to start your training.&quot;  You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Dad!&quot;  Marino smiled, going upstairs to his room.  You smiled, taking out your book and continuing where you left off.<br />
<br />
<br />
End of Chapter.<br />
