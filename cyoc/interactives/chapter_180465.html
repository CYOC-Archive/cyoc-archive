<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra hurried off so fast she barely even noticed she wasn&#39;t heading to the right locker room. As she headed inside, intent on finding her way to the showers, she didn&#39;t even see that she had passed the women&#39;s locker room and headed right into the men&#39;s locker room. Such was the intensity of her discomfort - she had only really had this happen to her once or twice before this, and thankfully she had managed to find her way to a shower in the women&#39;s locker room that time...but it seemed as she got older, when she failed to take her precautions, it only got worse and more distracting - hence her mistake.<br />
<br />
And it was an honest mistake.<br />
<br />
The were-frog looked down at her hands. She was stuck in such a form until she was fully soaked and feeling better. Then she could turn back to her regular human form. How could she even explain what happened to her?<br />
<br />
Kendra croaked miserably as she felt the water running down her body. She hated how much this affliction came to control her life. She couldn&#39;t have a boyfriend, like the other girls, and had to sit there and listen as the other girls in her class talked on about how they loved this boy or that boy. She acted like she had more important things to think about or do rather than deal with boy drama. But inside, she had wanted so badly to engage with a young man.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t help that the school had quite a selection of male eye candy.<br />
<br />
If the school had been relatively more academically driven, then maybe losing out on the romantic front would not sting so badly. But as it was, being alone here felt really, truly lonely. There was no solitude here.<br />
<br />
The wrestling team were a wide variety from the thin, taut and toned smaller weight classes to the towering, muscled hunks of the higher weight classes. The football team seemed to consist entirely of people who, at bare minimum had nice abs and well formed bodies, but at their best were basically physique models - muscular masculine paragons with wide shoulders and powerful, thick backs, huge pecs, and cobblestone abs. The swim team was comprised of toned, built young men always wet - so perhaps her best shot - and she loved the way a man looked when he was muscular and also shaved down to a near buzzcut.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, as Kendra thought about the types of men available at the school, some of such men were on their way to the locker room right then and there. A few members of the team were heading off to the locker room to wash off after a fitness test they endured from their coach - while the others in their PE class were still out there exercising. All among them were Varsity Players, 18 year old young men and the cream of the crop.<br />
<br />
Brady DeLane, the leader of the group, had short cut, somewhat wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a muscular, well toned build. Everyone loved the quarterback, and Brady epitomized the muscular, popular and well to do QB. He came from a wealthy family, and despite this and some minor arrogance when it came to his looks, Brady was fine. His chief flaw other than his ego was how he tended to get tunnel vision when he got a particular idea.<br />
<br />
Luis Ramos, one of the linebackers, was a powerfully built, muscled stud of a young man. Latino and known for his romantic ways, Luis had nicely styled black hair, almond colored eyes, and naturally tanned skin. Standing in at 230 lbs, Luis was an imposing figure that cut quite a profile.<br />
<br />
Greg Patrie, the half-back, was known as a daring and resourceful player, as would be required for his position. He had permed strawberry blond hair, green eyes, and a well toned, built physique made both for aesthetic appreciation by his many, many female admirers, and for function on the field. Greg was known as something of a player - he was famous on the team for throwing the best parties at Brady&#39;s &quot;party house&quot; out in the countryside. It was an arrangement as old as the friendship between Greg and Brady.<br />
<br />
And lastly Devin Kincaid, a ginger haired hulking young man, this defensive liner was very tall but more stocky than well built. His light blue eyes and shaved up appearance made him more handsome than he would otherwise be perceived as. Given a large gut and yet matching large muscles across his body, Devin was still quite popular with women even though he wasn&#39;t exactly conventionally attractive.<br />
<br />
Yet none of them as they walked in might expect what they stood to see.<br />
<br />
Kendra heard them before she saw them, realizing as she stood there that those heavy footfalls did not sound like the footfalls of girls. Her heart sank as she realized in her pain and discomfort she probably went into the wrong locker room. Meaning that a whole bunch of guys were going to see her...like this. As a were-frog. They&#39;d see her and likely spread the information around...<br />
<br />
And then she saw them - and they saw her. Her eyes traveled from one jock to the next. Taking in their shocked expressions. Though it seemed that Greg was shocked the least long - and his shocked expression was replaced by a sort of interest in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dudes, what the fuck are we looking at...?&quot; Brady murmured and took a step back. He didn&#39;t know if this was the sort of creature that&#39;d go after a jock one way or another. But he wasn&#39;t looking forward to finding out...until Greg took a step forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...I&#39;m sorry, I was in the wrong locker room, don&#39;t hurt me.&quot; She started, looking the guys over. Despite what she feared, she didn&#39;t see any of them looking ready to pounce on her or anything. Well, Greg was looking at her somewhat weirdly. But considering the circumstances, it was either the shocked and horrified expressions the others had or that. &quot;I-I just needed the water. I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But like, what even ARE you?&quot; Devin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m a were-frog. I have to change into this form every now and then, and get wet.&quot; She explained, &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m not a monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to mollify the more concerned and scared athletes. Brady stepped forward and looked at her, &quot;How in the world did you end up like this?&quot; He was at least not looking at her like that any more. She didn&#39;t know which was worse - the way Greg seemed ready to make a bid to &quot;tap that&quot; or the fact she could really see Brady&#39;s fear and revulsion before he calmed down.<br />
<br />
As Kendra calmed down herself, seeing as the situation was resolving itself enough, she looked at the guys. They were...honestly, they were all amazingly attractive in their own rights. Owing to the mix of hormones still swirling around in the aftermath of that, Kendra looked to the side, realizing she was starting to blush in her own way. She was definitely feeling interest in the Varsity men. People she&#39;d never have any shot whatsoever with - and who&#39;d probably never speak to her again after this.<br />
<br />
Greg then spoke up, &quot;Hey, so I have a few ideas. Miss Were-Frog, it&#39;s pretty obvious you&#39;re into us. You don&#39;t gotta be shy. We&#39;re here to use the showers too, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That obvious, huh?&quot; Kendra shook her head, looking at them again. Damn this were-frog body. She was really getting too into them. She had to cool her jets. &quot;Oh...Oh! Uh, go ahead.&quot; Kendra didn&#39;t know if she could control herself around these four specimens of masculinity. Greg seemed to be eagerly anticipating this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, if anything happens while we&#39;re all naked,&quot; Greg said with a grin, &quot;We&#39;ll be in the shower room. And our class isn&#39;t nearly done yet. So...I think we&#39;re all pretty free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Brady said even as he started disrobing, shucking off his football gear to the floor while moving to take out his shower stuff from his locker nearby, &quot;Not everything&#39;s gonna end in sex. I mean, it&#39;d be sweet if it did. I&#39;m not gonna discriminate.&quot; And upon seeing Brady first disrobing like that Kendra almost lost control then and there.<br />
<br />
Brady was gorgeous when he was naked. A nice, thick and modestly long but not too long manhood, the eighteen year old stud&#39;s body was perfectly toned. Oh, this was what she was missing out on. Nice, thick bodied muscular men...! She was drooling, her long tongue hanging out of her mouth. And she didn&#39;t even care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, looks like I&#39;m so hot, I turn on babes of all species.&quot; Brady accentuated this by flexing an arm. A well toned, eighteen inch arm. Kendra swooned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like we have a certain effect on her.&quot; Luis said, putting a hand on Greg&#39;s shoulder - before long both also stripped down. Greg was muscular and obviously well experienced, his knowing smirk said it all. Luis likewise - she loved his natural tan and muscular, huge body. Even as Devin stripped down she could appreciate how naturally he carried all that weight and managed to make it look good on him.<br />
<br />
The guys moved into the showers, and Kendra could barely manage two minutes before she got her tongue back in her mouth and started touching Brady&#39;s shoulder and lightly feeling his tight bubble butt. Brady turned over his shoulder as he looked at her, &quot;Can&#39;t help yourself around a bunch of studs like us, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if we join in too?&quot; Devin asked, extremely eager sounding. His manhood starting to chub up.<br />
<br />
Kendra didn&#39;t know if she should try and stop them or not. She knew very little about her condition outside of what she needed to do to stay comfortable. And having the option ready now to finally engage sexually with not one, not two, but four of the sexiest men available? It was too much for her to ever say no - even if there were certain effects...<br />
<br />
She deftly started jerking off Devin and Luis, while angling to try and go down on Brady and Greg, switching between the two and even using her tongue to accentuate how good her mouth felt on the men. Greg groaned as he felt this, &quot;Hot DAMN! I did not think I&#39;d be getting some sex outta this shower too!&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
But was sex all that Greg was going to get...?</h3>
