<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Viki, I thank you for carrying my sister, and saving me, but Lina must carry all of us for any of you to stand a chance against the hive, the time has come for the sisters of creation to be born anew&quot; said the placed one hand on Vikis cheek and the other on her belly.<br />
<br />
Viki then began to moan as her womb began to shrink, yellow sand like mist was now escaping through her womanhood and into the sand below, the sand then began to spiral upward and form a human body, Ava then glided over to Viki and hugged her, Viki simply smiled at her and hugged her in return &quot;even if Lina births you again, I will always be your mommy.......but only if that&#39;s what you want&quot; said Viki in a small voice, Ava looked up at Viki and pulled down her silk dress, exposing her large breasts, she then gently placed her mouth over Vikis rubber nipple and began to nurse, Viki placed her hand on the back of Ava&#39;s head, supporting her neck and comforting her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well while those two are bonding I would like to enter my new mommy, and join my sisters&quot; said the pink mist woman as she watched Lina lay back and spread her legs, a motherly smile on her face &quot;of corse, my baby girl, but I am afraid of what happened before when I had your twin in me, that heat, those flames, they were excruciating&quot; she said as she bagen to shiver with fear at the memory, then she felt her soon to be daughter rubbing her hands st the peak of her belly &quot;the only reason you felt such pain is because I was not there, one of us is not complete without the other see?&quot; She said as the two medallions appeared in her hands, and lina watched as the two slotted together perfectly, a small glow then began emitting from the twins, one pink and one yellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, come and be with your mommy and sisters baby&quot; said Lina as she placed her hands either side if her ballooned out womb and spread her legs wider, before she spoke her new daughters name &quot;Rose, by new daughter Rose, mommy loves you and your twin so much&quot; she said as she felt Rose&#39;s mist seeping into her birth canal, then she had a thought, all of her daughters had animal parts to them, and lina didn&#39;t want their redevelopment to take that way from them, it was a part of their individuality, so Lina grabbed the twins Medallion that remained suspended in the air, lina then took a deep breath, feeling Rose fully enter her womb, wriggling around to get comfortable, then she made her wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish everyone kept their rubber bodies but everyone had some part animal to them, and that everything we have is modified for every species&quot; she said, then her belly began to thrash, her Babies suddenly seeming hyper, full of energy, their kicks and punches could be seen al over Linas transparent womb surface, then she saw that Ava was no longer feeding from Viki, Viki was now knelt down between Linas legs and guiding the now baby form of Ava into Linas pussy.<br />
 <br />
Lina&#39;s mouth turned into a large O, she had taken in Echo, Storm, Luna and Rose, but somehow now she had asked a wish while Viki was helping Ava into Linas womb, it felt different, like childbirth but in reverse, she didn&#39;t understand why Ava hadn&#39;t turned into mist like her sisters had, but the plesure Lina felt as the now newborn sized Ava&#39;s head being pulled towards her womb proved too much for her brain to handle, the pleasure of feeling her baby sliding into her pussy, her head now grinding against her pelvis and her pussy lips now spread out wide with her shoulders, then Lina felt a building energy from within her womb, then her vision was consumed by white light.<br />
<br />
When Lina awoke she could hear the familiar hum of the train, the rush of the air, and clear sunlight raining down on her face, she then herd the beeping of what she guessed to be a heart monitor, she was in the first aid car, hen she looked down and had to suppress a scream due to the shocked of what she saw,<br />
<br />
Her top half looked normal, her blue rubber body with her clouds and peacock was as it should be, but her belly was flat, no longer transparent, but where her legs should have been now continued into a body made of chestnut brown fur, her lower body felt strong and muscular, her new legs were thick and furry, each leg now ending in large clawed pads, she then turned to follow her new body&#39;s length, she how had back legs too, they too were thick and strong with padded claws, below where her rubber back was there was a sholder hump at the base of her back, and she could feel a small stubby tail at her back end, then her eyes fell on her bodies underbelly.<br />
<br />
It was transparent and rubber, like her belly had been before, and all her children were inside, however their animal like features had returned, but more pronounced, Echo now had the lower half of a green vine snake, which she had curled around herself in a sort of blanket, Storm now had tail feathers as well as her white wings, and her eyes now looked more owl like as they stared out into the world, Rose now had a body simular to Linas, Lina realising she had become part bear! Exactly like a beartaur, Rose was now holding her front paws with her hands as she put one paw into her mouth, Lina chuckled at this finding it quite funny, Avas scales had spread from her arms to along her neck and down her legs, a lizard like tail now emerging at the base of her hips, the only one who seemed unefected was Luna, her skin still blue and black and still maintaining her four arms, one of which was now a fist in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I made the wish, so I can&#39;t complain, so may as well make the most of it&quot; as Lina attempted to get up, being extra careful of her underbelly, then Lina noticed that the room seemed bigger, the rooms design had stayed the same but now certain changes had been made.<br />
<br />
The roof was now higher up, and they spaces between the furniture and the walkway down the middle of the car seemed wider and easier to navigate, Lina then carefully stepped down off the bed which seemed lower to the ground so it was basically like walking down a single step, she felt the way her new body moved, her strong frame made the weight of her pregnancy almost non existent, if not for the large bulge of her belly which now stuck out at the sides as well as hanging low, Lina wouldn&#39;t have known she was pregnant, she then focused on her large pads, they were extremely sensitive, as she walked on the wooden floor she could feel every grain in the wood and the small vibrations through the trains frame as they flew, Lina then fellt her brood kicking pressing and flapping out at her wombs walls for space, so Lina decided to widen her stance, letting her underbelly fall into her new hips more, giving her litter the much needed room they wanted<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god your up&quot; came Sofias voice, Lina turned to look at her and was shocked by what she saw.<br />
<br />
Sofias upper half looked as it always had, except for her belly now to being flat, and a pair of long ears from the top of her head, but at the base of Sofias hips, or what used to be hips is when things got weird, her friend now had a second pair of arms, they were shorter and covered in a sand coloured fur, both paws had three fingers with small black claws on the ends, her body looked long and muscular, with large strong back legs, her feet were long and black, but the pads of her feet were smaller than the length of what looked like her foot, and a long thick tail of pure muscle trailed behind her, her belly was also rubber and transparent with her five babies in, but only the top half was visible, the bottom half was covered by a fur covered pouch, then it dawned on Lina what her friend had become, she was a Kangarootaur!<br />
<br />
Sofia then put her fur covered arms on the ground as her human half stayed upright, and her back legs jumped forward, almost exactly like how a kangaroo would move when it wasn&#39;t bounding around at high speed, the only difference being that Sofia had to be careful of her swolen womb between her strong muscular legs.<br />
<br />
But what confused Lina was that she acted like everything was fine! Like this is how things had always been &quot;well its about time you woke up mama bear, you&#39;ve been out for three days since we got out of that cave, your needy mates have been worried sick&quot; said Sofia as she began to blush &quot;to be honest I haven&#39;t been any better, and let me tell you, stress is not good for keeping theis joeys calm&quot; she said as her paw stroked over her womb.<br />
<br />
Then the door from the lounge car opened and in walked Lucy, or who Lina presumed to be Lucy.........</p>
