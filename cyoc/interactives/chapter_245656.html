<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ricardo “Rick” Sanchez is a 22-year-old man who’s parents had migrated to the US when he was still a baby, he has short light brown hair, light brown skin, hazelnut-brown eyes and an athletic figure. He has been working as a lifeguard at the water park since he was 16, his colleagues describe him as a quiet person, who sticks to himself, some even describe him as being somewhat “creepy”, because of the way he tends to look at woman. Since he was 13, Rick had problems with relationships, either the girls he asks out reject him, and whenever he starts a relationship with a girl, that relationship only lasts a week or two before the girl breaks up with him.<br />
<br />
The young man is more than frustrated, wanting nothing more than to finally get the female he deserves, who would never break up with him, who’d do anything for him… HIS perfect girl. A few weeks ago, Rick had stumbled across the Chronivac-app, ‘if I can’t find the perfect girl the natural way,’ he had thought, ‘then I’ll just MAKE me one,’ his plan was to use the app to cause a young woman to fall in love with him, however he hasn’t yet found the ONE woman who in his mind is “the one”.<br />
<br />
As Rick walks through the water park, trying to keep a low profile as he checks out all the woman at the water park, the 22-year-old hears the sound of someone sobbing, turning his head he notices an 8-year-old boy sitting on a bench, his head in his hands. Rick stops in his tracks and just stares at the boy, as he stares at the sobbing boy, the boy seems to change into a beautiful 20-year-old woman with long blond smooth hair, big and firm C32 breasts, wide hips, big, firm and round butt and an amazing hourglass figure. Of course the boy isn’t really transforming into the woman, but Rick’s mind, which seems to have broken due to his frustration, causes Rick to see the boy as his perfect woman, a grin appears on the 22-year-old’s face, ‘I think, I’ve finally found the perfect woman,’ he thinks to himself, and starts to slowly approach the boy.<br />
<br />
“Hey, kid,” Rick says, crouching down to the boy, “you alright?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at the man, “I… I lost my… brother,” he sniffles.<br />
<br />
“Aaaw, well… let me help you find him,” Rick says, “my name is Rick, I’m a lifeguard here, what is your name?”<br />
<br />
“My… my name is… Je-Jeff,” Jeff sniffles.<br />
<br />
“And your brother?”<br />
<br />
“M-Max”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what does he look like,” Rick asks.<br />
<br />
“He… he looks k-kinda like me,” Jeff says, “j-just bigger, he’s 10… and he… he is wearing a swim shorts… it’s blue with… a lightning design”.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “alright, then let’s go find him,” he says, holding out his hand to the boy.<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitates, but then he takes the hand, ‘I don’t have any other choice,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles and starts to lead Jeff through the water park, “don’t be afraid, Jeff,” he says, “this water park is huge, it’s easy to get lost, especially when it’s this crowded. Don’t worry, we’ll find your brother”.<br />
<br />
Jeff continues to sniffle, “o-okay,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
“Is this your first visit to the water park,” Rick asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah”.<br />
<br />
“Do you like it?”<br />
<br />
“It’s… it’s cool, I guess,” Jeff mumbles, “there are a lot of fun rides, but right now… all I want is to find my brother. I just hope he’s not gonna be mad at me”.<br />
<br />
“And even if he should be,” Rick says, “you shouldn’t take it personally, see it this way: wouldn’t he be mad at you, that would mean he doesn’t care about you. However, should he be mad, that means he was worried about you, that again means that he cares about you”.<br />
<br />
“I… I know,” Jeff says, “st-still… I do-don’t like getting… shout at”.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “no one does,” he says, “just remember to be more careful next time, I know kids your age get distracted pretty fast. I guess that is what happened, hm?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-yeah, I… I saw someone wearing a lizard costume, it looked so real”.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “that must have been Lars,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at Rick for the first time, “Lars?”<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “Lars is the guy who dresses up as our mascot,” he explains, “that costume is made of high quality silicone to make it look as real as possible”.<br />
<br />
“Whoa… must have been expensive,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “I assume it was,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I think lizards are cool,” Jeff then says, starting to feel a lot better, talking with Rick causes the 8-year-old to not think about finding Max, now he is more focused in talking with Rick about the “lizard”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “yeah, I too love lizards,” he says, “but I love all reptile species. Reptiles are so cool!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, smiling, “yeah, they are,” he says, “I wish I had a lizard or snake as a pet!”<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “I have an alligator lizard back at my place,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Rick takes out his phone, opening his gallery and showing Jeff a picture.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen at the image, “whoa, what a cool looking lizard,” he says.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “yeah, his name is Jaws,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What a cool name,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Rick says, putting his phone back into his pocket.<br />
<br />
They continue to walk in silence for a while, “do you live alone,” Jeff then asks.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “sadly, yes,” he says, “but I do wish to have someone I could share my life with. However, I don’t seem to have any luck with women”.<br />
<br />
“Oh…, I’m sorry,” Jeff says, “what kind of woman do you like?”<br />
<br />
“I find women with blue eyes, long smooth blond hair, big firm breasts and a stunning hourglass figure super attractive,” Rick says, “what about you?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little, “I… I’m honestly don’t know yet,” he says.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “well, you’re still young, you have more than enough time to figure that out,” he says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yep,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You seem like a smart boy,” Rick then says, “do you know anything about relationships? Or how babies are made?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “not… really,” he mumbles, “I mean… I’ve seen mommy and daddy kiss differently than when they kiss me, and at night… mommy sometimes makes funny and strange noises… always wakes me up”.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “yeah, sex usually causes people to be… noisy,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Sex,” Jeff asks, tilting his head.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “that’s how babies are made,” he says, then grins, “if you’d like to know more and learn about it… I wouldn’t mind showing you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, he then shrugs, “why not,” he says, “I’m always keen to learn stuff”.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “then come with me, I know a place where we’d be by ourselves, and where no one will bother us”.<br />
<br />
“What about my brother,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“We’ll look for him after,” Rick says, “I promise it won’t take long”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jeff simply says.<br />
<br />
Rick’s smile widens, “then follow me,” he says and starts leading Jeff towards the “authorized personal only” area of the water park.</p>
