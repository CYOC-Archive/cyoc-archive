<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max liked domenating his new pony brother, but there was still a lot of resistance in Tony. Their dynamic wasn&#39;t perfectly sub/dom yet. It was a physical thing. Max had to look up at his slave. That was just wrong. And Tony was still clearly stronger than him. It should be the other way around. Max got to work on the chronivac, switching their ages. But he wasn&#39;t done yet. He still had a few adjustments to make to Tony, himself, their reality and their society. <br />
<br />
Tony woke in a stall, feeling strange. Since when had they owned a stall? It also seemed way bigger than it should have been. Not that he himself could move much. The chains attached to his harnesses, the only things he wore, were quite restrictive, forcing him to stand upright. He didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d managed to sleep standing. Maybe it had been a change Max had given him. <br />
<br />
Max entered an hour or so later. Or at least Tony assumed it was Max. His little brother wasn&#39;t so little anymore. Max towered over Tony, making him feel less like a stallion and more like a colt (Young male horse). Max had grown to at least Tony&#39;s age, but was far taller and muscular than Tony had ever been. And it wasn&#39;t until now that Tony realized how small and weak he himself had become. He couldn&#39;t see his own arms because they were bound behind him by the harnesses, but he bet they would be scrawny things. He had seen his legs and exposed crotch, and they were small and completely hairless. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s my little filly?&quot; (Young female horse). Tony struggle angrily against his chains, determined to show that he wasn&#39;t going to give in and just let Max dominate him like this. It helped distract him from the shame he felt for standing naked and weak in front of what should have been his little brother. He glared with blushing cheeks, fighting his instincts to look away in humiliation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you&#39;re all excited to start your new life,&quot; Max said gesturing to Tony&#39;s crotch. Tony looked down and saw with shock that his undersized, smooth male part was indeed excited. But that didn&#39;t make sence. He hated being treated like this. Didn&#39;t he? His heart had started racing as soon as he&#39;d layer eyes on his now manly brother, but that wasn&#39;t right. Tony wasn&#39;t gay. He knew he wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Max chuckled at how Tony shifted awkwardly and his defiant glares so easily melted into a bashful stance. Smooth thighs shyly pressed together while his ankles were slightly apart with his feet facing inward. Toes curled. Sholders razed as if to try and hide. Head lowered submissively. <br />
<br />
Max marveled at his creation. He&#39;d not only changed Tony&#39;s physical features, but also made Tony 100% gay while putting him in complete and shameful denial of his own desires for both cock and submission.<br />
<br />
Tony tried to resist as Max undid the chains and pulled him out into the yard by the rains. They passed the storage room full of all the fun equipment to use on Tony later, as well as the entrance to the punishment room that would help diciplin the young pony boy.<br />
<br />
Tony still walked on bare feet. In this reality, this was his first day as a pony. It would have been easy to alter Tony all the way in one go, but the jurney was half the fun. The barns floors were smooth and the lawn outside was soft, but he&#39;d need to get his horse shoes before being able to run on the track or be taked out into town or to their friends or to the store to carry grosuries or to the local pub. He&#39;d get a lot of attention. Pony boys weren&#39;t unheard of, but most people had never seen one in person. Besides, Tony was now the youngest pony boy on record by at least six years. And he looked like he could be even younger. Before their age swap, Max had at least had the start of body hair. Tony didn&#39;t even have that.<br />
<br />
Criminals were sometimes sentenced to be human horses, and only for the worst of crimes above 18 years old. The only other way to become a pony was to volunteer. Extremely few people volunteered for obvious reasons. You&#39;d have to resign your human rights, and even real horses got more rights than human horses. And once it was official, the status was perminant. It was in fact illegal to treat a pony boy as a human. Giving them too much dignity could result in a fine or worse. <br />
<br />
Tony was obviously shockes at the sight of their garden. It was the same place, but the garden was now huge and ornate with lots of room for a yong pony to get the exercise it needs. And while the house was the same, it had grown and blossomed new rooms and balconies until it became a veratable mansion. Their family was now stinking rich! <br />
<br />
Their father came out towards them. It was the first time he&#39;d seen his son since he became a pony. Like everyone, he&#39;d been shocked when Tony had publicly declared his desire to become his brother&#39;s pony, but while others were accepting of his choices, their father had been very angry with him for throwing his life away like that. He had a lot of pent up anger against his boy for this. And he was going to make damn sure Tony got more than he bargained for. Even though Tony was legally Max&#39;s property, their father had certain rights over him since this land and the equipment was his.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a pathetic discrace you make,&quot; said their father, Ivon. He was a large man with a stoic demeanor, sharp eyes and broad sholders. A strict perfectionist in every way. He&#39;d intended to have perfect sons, but now that he instead had only one son and one pony boy, he&#39;d changed his expectations to have the perfect son and perfect pet/slave/horse/sex toy anyone could have.<br />
<br />
Tony held his head low as if trying to hide. Ivon didn&#39;t understand what had gone through the pathetic ex-human&#39;s mind. He&#39;d said he&#39;d wanted to be forced to be a pony. That a part of him was reluctant and he wanted to pretend he didn&#39;t want it. If he wanted to be forced and degraded that was what he was going to get in spades. <br />
<br />
Ivon grabbed Tony by the chin and inspected him like he would a horse. Quite a pretty boy. He would have grown into a handsome man. But his youth was what made him unique and valuable as a pony. Drugs would make sure he stayed this way. It would make all his tasks as a pony harder for him, but that wasn&#39;t Ivon&#39;s problem. The pony boy was sporting a shameful erection all the while. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got a lot of work ahead of us with this one,&quot; Ivon said. &quot;It still looks like a person. Give it a pony haircut, get it&#39;s hormone injections and the piercings it needs. Then we&#39;ll look at equipment and possibly perminant alterations, operations, tattoos or brandings. Tony whimpered as if it hadn&#39;t known this would happen. No use regretting now. Even if his owners had allowed it to go back to pretending to be a human, the government would just take him away and sell him on auction like a dehumanized criminal. He&#39;d make a good price at this age too. Ivon was seriously considering talking Max into selling Tony and never having to deal with this embarisment anymore. Forget he&#39;d ever even existed.</p>
