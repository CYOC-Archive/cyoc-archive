<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the elephant in the room, especially now that she had discovered knowledge about it. Maybe the information was only first revealed to her when it became important or relevant for the first time, but that was something to test for another time: for Hana right now, the only thing on her mind was her dick.<br />
<br />
Hana was salivating at sight of it. She could even feel that her pussy, as inexperienced as it was, starting to get damp somewhere underneath her balls. As Jeff, she had never been attracted to cocks. But she wasn&#39;t Jeff anymore, though... and it just felt <i>right</i>. There was a momentary alarm bell that went off: this wasn&#39;t going to be so easily reversible as anticipated if she was going to be naturally accepting of her new life!<br />
<br />
Yet that too passed, when the first signs of true arousal hit Hana. There was a pulsing feeling down in her sack as the hairless thing began to swell. Sure, it had been heavy and dense just moments earlier in a strangely pleasurable way, but now there was the distinct feeling of <i>pressure</i> building up down there! It was amazing and alarming for the very same reasons: it was as well-developed an erogenous zone as her dick or clit or nipples were, and Hana could feel that, but <i>boy</i> did it induce an urgency into the mix. It wasn&#39;t just going to be simply getting off. Now that she was going to be swelling, it meant that she had an urge and a need to get off: a race towards <i>relief</i>. One Hana intrinsically knew that was always going to be the case, because fragments of vivid memories were now flooding into her mind. Leaving her in the dark about so much, but more than enough to tease her at what Hana&#39;s day-to-day experience can <i>really</i> be like. She blushed bright red!<br />
<br />
The shock of the heavy lust and hunger such an endowed body gave the little girl, and the shock of finding herself still shy and embarrassed of many of the facets of having a body like that... they were at an inherent tension. They ran up against each other head-on, and made Hana&#39;s penis so much more perversely horrifying and scarily attractive for herself. An objected to be feared, loathed, and loved; an object of reverence and worship and <i>power!</i> She was just starting to duck her head down as the follow-up happened to what was going on with her balls. The girl&#39;s veiny piece of girldick <i>throbbed</i>. Before, it was already a strange mix of being an oddly &quot;girly&quot; penis while still being an obviously and grotesque figure of masculinity on her body: beautiful and ugly.<br />
<br />
The beautiful aspect of her cock was primarily in its skin and shape. It was smooth, and (largely) flawless; very much <i>her</i> girly, smooth skin that was so well maintained, albeit still distinctly the texture of cockflesh. The lack of any sort of pubic hair helped, that was certain, but it could simply be said it was a girly cock. That was a thing that existed now in this new reality. People <i>knew</i> what that meant. ...The somewhat grotesque aspect of it was more that it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> flawless, not fully. It was veiny. Oh, it was <i>so</i> very veiny, even the smallest vessel seeming like major arteries to keep that massive girldick properly supplied. So large and taut with the throbbing flow through them that they were pretty hard to the touch!  Then of course there was her glans. Quite a lot bigger than a fist, while not quite being more than two fits combined; it bulged and swelled and had a distinctly purplish hue, even when she wasn&#39;t aroused. <br />
<br />
...She was <i>very</i>aroused right now, though. So Hana did the only thing she knew to do, the only thing that she could do to really satisfy this beast: she made out with it and hugged it like it was her lover. <br />
<br />
It was too big for the small girl to fit in her mouth, but it didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t find herself drooling for it. What portion of Jeff was left in her brain was yelling how wrong it was, but Hana was too enthralled by her cock to care. Once she leaned forward more towards her juicy glans, to the point that she could feel her breath on it... the overwhelming scent of her cock made her mind haze over. It wasn&#39;t something Hana had quite noticed in the midst of the shock, and with her tactile senses being initially overwhelmed, but now that that was normalizing in her mind... she had a powerful scent. Maybe it only had really come into force when she got aroused, but somehow Hana had a hard time imagining a giant slab of dick that&#39;s always that hard could ever fully lose its scent. It wouldn&#39;t affect her much unaroused, even if she could still detect it faintly, but it sure would ensnare other girls and women if she weren&#39;t careful. The thought and memory made her mortified, but it sure made spit up a giant glob of cum. ...Or, really, precum. It was &#39;normal&#39; cum in every way, but Hana just knew it was only her pre. She knew she was so virile that that happened. ...Oddly enough, the taste was more pleasant than other cum, too. It was a little sweet, and perhaps had a mild vanilla taste...? It was <i>good</i>. It was no wonder she liked it so much, even when it still had the strong smell it should&#39;ve normally had, even if it still had a fair bit of that taste underneath it all. The sheer pleasure of sucking on her cockhead and jerking herself off with her arms, grinding against her body, all of that combined with the addictive smell, and the somewhat sweet taste that satisfied her little-girl sweet-tooth?<br />
<br />
It&#39;s no wonder Hana was truly enthralled by her cock.<br />
<br />
* * * <br />
<br />
It was a little over an hour before Hana even got close to blowing her load. She was being guided so heavily by her lust, instinct, and muscle-memory that she hadn&#39;t noticed the time passing, nor even confronted the internal conflict between her natural memories and those put in place by the chronivac. It was only after that hour had passed, when she finally began to make some progress to orgasm that she really noticed that discrepancy. One thread of lucid thought amongst a lusty haze, and it was so consequential... for, now Hana&#39;s corrected memories were starting to materialize about this. She had been surprised and frustrated at how long it was taking her to get off, but it was then she realized how normal that was; if anything, she was making better progress than typical, and getting herself off could be an all-day affair without help!<br />
<br />
Hana, now that she was no longer so absorbed with pleasuring her dick, also became quite aware how much she&#39;d already &#39;came&#39;. She&#39;d already drank down several meals&#39; worth of it, and that was still in reality just the <i>appetizer</i>. Her balls had also swollen significantly over the hour: from grapefruit to bordering on small watermelons each, they were several inches wider!<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do about you...&quot; Hana mumbled to herself, almost talking to her cock like it was a person. She was apprehensive about just continuing, because she knew she wouldn&#39;t be able to swallow all of her load... she didn&#39;t want to make a huge mess, either! It was also highly tempting to... employ the help of someone else with this. It made her blush and squirm in shameful embarrassment from a more coherent part of her brain, but Hana <i>knew</i> she could get help from her little sister, Takako, or her mother, Aiko. Or... her other mother, Kaede, even if that risked having to help her with <i>her</i> dick. Hana also looked over towards the chronivac, biting her lower lip. She could have literally anyone she wanted, even someone who already didn&#39;t exist, with a little bit of typing.<br />
<br />
<b>Who is Hana going to seek the help of to get off?</b></p>
