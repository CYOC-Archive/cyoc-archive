<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I looked at Michael, Bai, and Sara and said, &quot;We'd better do as she says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But won't we drown if we do?&quot; Bai asked looking worried and nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we will,&quot; I said looking at our blue hair. &quot;If Poseidon is our father we won't <br />
drown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he isn't?&quot; Sara asked looking scared. &quot;A friend of mine drowned last <br />
year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I don't know,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I don't think I'm wrong though and it sounds like <br />
we live in Poseidon's palace so we should be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm as sure as I can be,&quot; I said. I was almost absolutely sure that we'd be safe. <br />
The woman did bring what she called hippocampi and I couldn't find any reason to not <br />
believe her on that. I could see what appeared to be horses in the lake and they <br />
hadn't been there before.<br />
<br />
We walked out into the water and I found it strange that I didn't get wet. I could feel <br />
the water but I didn't feel wet which just bolstered my confidence that we wouldn't <br />
drown. I stopped walking and decided to do a little experiment. I concentrated on <br />
making some of the water rise up and form a hand. There was a little pull on the core <br />
of my being and the water reacted as I had wanted it to. Michael looked at it and <br />
asked, &quot;How did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poseidon is our father now so we have control over water,&quot; I said with a smile. I <br />
looked at the woman and said, &quot;Though I think we need to hurry and follow that <br />
woman. She doesn't look happy that I stopped to do my little experiment.&quot; The others <br />
nodded their agreement looking braver than a few moments ago probably because <br />
they weren't getting wet themselves and my little experiment.<br />
<br />
Once we were on the hippocampi the woman turned the one she was on around and <br />
dived below the surface. Our's followed and we were plunged into the depths of the <br />
lake and through a cave. Sara had cried out when we went under but I held her hand <br />
and that seemed to calm her down. There was no light to see by in the depths of the <br />
lake and the cave but I could see in a sense. I could only guess that I was sensing <br />
where the water stopped when it encountered some type of body. The hippocampi <br />
were going pretty fast and our hair streamed out behind us. &quot;This is weird,&quot; Sara said <br />
sounded awed. &quot;I can't see anything but I know where everything is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like echolocation,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;Instead of sending out sound waves though <br />
we're using the water itself. I don't know how far we can sense objects in the water <br />
though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The salt content of the water had been increasing over the past few seconds and now <br />
I thought that we had transitioned into the sea. After about an hour we exited the cave <br />
and were riding over the sea floor, or I should say the ocean floor since I got the <br />
sense it was bigger than a sea. After a few more minutes we arrived at a palace that <br />
put every other palace to shame. It was massive made out of what looked like the <br />
finest marble bejeweled with gold and gems. There was a light surrounding the palace <br />
which made it easy to see and the light didn't hurt my eyes. We left the hippocampi in <br />
the care of a mermaid and swam through the palace until we were in a throne room. <br />
Sitting in two thrones made of marble were two beings that must have been at least <br />
thirty feet tall. They had to be Poseidon and Amphitrite. They both wore chitons though <br />
Poseidon only had it fastened over his right shoulder which exposed part of his <br />
chiseled chest and it came down down to his knees. He did have long hair which was <br />
blue and he was holding his trident. Amphitrite had her chiton fastened over both <br />
shoulders and it came down to her ankles like ours. She smiled down at us as the <br />
woman who brought us here kneeled and said, &quot;We have returned my lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poseidon nodded and said, &quot;You are dismissed Hermione.&quot; Hermione bowed then <br />
quickly left. Once she was gone Poseidon looked at us and said, &quot;I would imagine you <br />
have some questions. I will answer them as best as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really our father now?&quot; Michael asked not showing much respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show a bit more respect,&quot; I said glaring at Michael, &quot;this is Poseidon. He could turn <br />
you into anything or vaporize you where you stand if you upset him.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of fear came over the other's faces and the took a couple steps back. Poseidon <br />
laughed and said, &quot;You're right Anthea but I'll overlook a lack of respect for now. To <br />
answer your question Nausikaa I am you're father now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can that be... Father,&quot; Bai asked showing respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you drank the water I changed your lineage a bit Dike,&quot; Poseidon said with a <br />
smile. &quot;You still have the same mothers but I'm your father now. Which is why you <br />
don't appear Chinese anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I must be Semele then,&quot; Sara said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and the youngest,&quot; Poseidon said. &quot;Anthea is the oldest followed by Nausikaa <br />
then Dike and lastly you Semele. All four of you are now demigods and being such <br />
you'll have to train to fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you bring us from our world Father?&quot; I asked hoping that he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately I did not take you from your own world so I can not send you back,&quot; <br />
Poseidon said with a heavy sigh. &quot;I can bring your families from your world to this one <br />
though if that's what you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you turn us into girls Father?&quot; Michael, or I should say Nausikaa, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthea wanted to be a girl and I wanted you to be the same sex,&quot; Poseidon said <br />
shrugging. &quot;I know you can handle the transformation. Now I'm sure you're hungry so <br />
we'll eat now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poseidon and Amphitrite stood up and shrank down until they were the size of normal <br />
humans. Amphitrite then spoke for the first time saying, &quot;I hope you girls will like it here <br />
in the palace. I would like for you to stay here of course but you may want to stay in <br />
the world of mortals. It's your choice of course but give living here a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I may like it here,&quot; I said as we followed Poseidon and Amphitrite to a dining <br />
hall. &quot;I'm assuming that this palace is at the bottom of a trench where mortals can't <br />
reach it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would be correct,&quot; Amphitrite said with a smile. &quot;I'm sure you've already guessed <br />
how we can be at this depth without being crushed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We subconsciously push the water back from us eliminating the crushing pressure we <br />
would otherwise feel,&quot; I said looking at the mosaics of ancient battles and sea <br />
creatures.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; Amphitrite said with a smile. &quot;Now sit down and we'll have something to <br />
eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
We sat down and mermaids brought us platters of seafood. It was cooked and tasted <br />
great. I guessed that as daughters of Poseidon we would naturally prefer seafood over <br />
other food. We engaged in small talk learning things about each other and we learned <br />
a little bit about how the sea is run. After we had finished eating Poseidon said, &quot;I'm <br />
going to give the four of you a choice. You can go to your room and rest and you'll <br />
begin training tomorrow or you can begin training immediately. Which will you choose <br />
to do?&quot;</p>
