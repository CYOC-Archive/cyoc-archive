<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff saw the popup explaining &quot;Contagion package successfully applied to Michael Hodges&quot; and immediately decided to reverse the already completed transformation. Next he checked his profile which said he was in good health. And finally he checked the contagion package which makes something about somebody contagious... Jeff selected himself and pressed enter, assuming that was what he bumped when he accidentally activated it but this time he read the popup, a 10 second timer was counting down on the popup since in pressing enter he had already given the command to use the package... there was a dropdown which had &quot;Secondary Sexual Characteristic Maturity&quot; highlighted and Jeff had to look it up after clicking the dropdown paused the timer. It showed a slew of other options which may have been selected if he accidentally pressed the down arrow which ranged from the perverse to the bizarre... <br />
<br />
Jeff briefly considered changing someone&#39;s name to &quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer-Schmidt&quot; and making their name contagious and got a chill realizing that with the Chronivac existing... that very well could have been the origin of the song in the first place with a little time travel...<br />
<br />
Before exiting the command he noticed world awareness defaulted to off, user awareness defaulted to on, and reality change was on. He checked his profile again just to be sure he was still in good health, and he was. &quot;Disaster averted...&quot; <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the pizza arrived and like every teenager, he appeared instantly as soon as his dad called him for food. They ate in the living room in front of the TV, Jeff grabbed the hot stringy cheese with his fingers and popped it into his mouth, it was at that moment the contagion Mike had spread as soon as the Chronivac made him contagious entered Jeff&#39;s body and began to transform him because jeff forgot to wash his hands and the contagion can go dormant and survive for several hours outside a suitable environment.<br />
<br />
Jeff began to feel ill halfway through his meal. Jeff excused himself which Mike didn&#39;t mind because it was probably the 35th time over the last few years that he tried to explain what was happening but Jeff still asked the same questions.<br />
<br />
Jeff checked his dad&#39;s profile again, making sure there were no packages active on him, there weren&#39;t. Then he checked his own profile, &quot;Unknown Infection&quot; which Jeff couldn&#39;t simply remove... It was only unknown because the only carrier of the illness was already cleansed of it, and so it was removed from memory to make room for all the other information the program needs to keep track of.<br />
<br />
One of the options Jeff didn&#39;t notice while he experimented was the type of illness this mimicked. It defaulted to the 12 hour flu. Hits real hard, real fast, completely knocks the infected out, they wake up feeling fine and anybody but Jeff, wouldn&#39;t know anything had changed.<br />
<br />
It must be food poisoning, Jeff thought, already feeling feverish and achy, He curled up on top of his bed and in true lazy teenager fashion, flopped the comforter over him making a Jeff taco. He passed out immediately, it was barely 7.<br />
<br />
As dawn approached his dad knocked on his door, &quot;Hey kiddo, how you feeling this morning? You feeling up for school?&quot; <br />
<br />
Normally Jeff would use any excuse to skip school, he was normally exhausted in the mornings but he felt oddly invigorated. &quot;I think it passed, musta been food poisoning or something.&quot; Jeff called in an unusually gravely voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re feeling better, but if you sweat something out you probably need a shower, get moving and get out of yesterday&#39;s clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff huffed and looked at Mike, &quot;Thanks dad&quot; he said flatly letting his head collapse on the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move&quot; Mike said shutting the door.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled out of bed feeling a strange sense of being misplaced, each step left him in the wrong spot, and his sense of perspective seemed off. After a few steps Jeff just kept his eyes closed to keep from feeling vertigo, he stripped and got clothes out of his dresser and closet, He ran down the hall naked yelling &quot;DONT LOOK.&quot; and was again surprised at his voice as he ducked into the bathroom, but this wouldn&#39;t be the first morning his voice was misbehaving.<br />
<br />
He shut the door, turned on the light, and screamed, there was a naked man in the bathroom with him! It only took a half second for him to realize it was his reflection, His dad called to confirm if he was alright, &quot;Yeah... Spider.&quot; Jeff was no longer the spindly boy he was last night he had all the features of a fully grown adult... except his penis didn&#39;t get any bigger, nor his balls.<br />
<br />
It took almost no time for him to put 2 and 2 together, his illness last night was the contagion package at work bringing him to full secondary sex trait maturity. He had his dads beard... same length and thickness, just minus the gray, he was now muscular and beefy just like his dad, taller probably his dad&#39;s height, maybe his own adult height whatever that would have been, and he had the full 35 year old dad-bod coat of body hair, way beyond anything he ever saw on the senior class men in the changing room. It went from his chest up to his shoulders and down his arms... He probably had some on his back too having seen his dad in the pool befo...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore the spider and take your shower!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Sorry dad.&quot; oh and his voice. All together he could easily pass for 20, 25 if shirtless probably.<br />
<br />
Jeff started the water. I can fix this, but I do need to shower... I can just revert my age back to 16 and I&#39;ll be right back to normal, three minutes tops.<br />
<br />
Jeff was marveling a the sheer quantity of hair, he pieced together from what he had read last night that he was probably as hairy as his dad is at 40 something after having had decades to activate all the andro... agro... whatever the puberty sensitive hair is called. &quot;Oof, by the time I&#39;m 40 my chest will be as dense as the top of my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shampooed his hair and had no idea what to do with his beard... it needed cleaning too right? Its hair, so shampoo. Does it get conditioned? Oh my god if Dad was going bald would I be bald right now?<br />
<br />
&quot;JEFF! Hurry Up! You are running out of time for breakfast!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhgggg&quot; was Jeff&#39;s eloquent rebuttal <br />
<br />
Jeff took a loofa, body wash, and 12 seconds to quickly touch most of his body with soapy water and rinse off... He stepped out of the shower, toweling off as he put on socks and underwear, throwing on a t-shirt and pants which all fit him perfectly. He hasn&#39;t pieced together that the shirt is XLT and the pants are 34 inch inseam. Jeff is now 6&#39;6&#39;&#39; 3 inches taller than his dad.<br />
<br />
As he came into the kitchen, clothes clinging awkwardly to his barely dried body, his dad told him to sit and eat. A robust meal had been prepared, way more food than his 130 lb self could imagine eating... he was however 215 lbs and as soon as he started eating the food quickly disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Comb your hair, tame or trim your beard, grab your backpack, and get to the bus stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff ran to the bathroom throwing water on his head and face and running a comb through all his hair, &#39;what am I doing I need to just reset my age!&#39; Jeff ran to his room wiggling his mouse, his profile was still up from last night when he had the &#39;unknown infection&#39;, he scrolled up to his age, 16. Thinking fast, he scrolled down to effects applied, None.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared dumbfounded... If this is him at 16 and there aren&#39;t any effects applied by the Chronivac, then how can he undo it? (The effect was applied by the illness, not the machine itself.) <br />
<br />
&quot;JEFF! I SEE THE BUS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed his bookbag and ran out the door, possibly stealing his dads shoes on accident. As he ran across the yard it was unsetting how soft the ground was as each foot pressed against the earth. It hadn&#39;t even rained recently. It was also exhilarating that he could feel his pecs bounce with every bound he took...<br />
<br />
He made it to the bus stop as the bus was pulling up... then he realized that school buses are not made for adult sized people.</p>
