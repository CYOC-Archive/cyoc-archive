<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan lay panting on the bench press, his massive chest heaving, the muscles trembling and rubbery.<br />
<br />
He was exhausted. It had taken 700 pounds to do it, but man, did it feel good! A dazed grin stretched across face, exposing his sharp teeth. His barbed, feline tongue probed them. Something about the shape of his teeth felt all wrong, but he couldn’t quite put his paw on what that might be.<br />
<br />
Jeff beamed down at the lion and extended a paw, “Time to hit the showers!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure,” Ryan said, voice deep and vacant.<br />
<br />
He took the paw and the tiger lifted the former human onto his paws. Ryan wobbled as an intense feeling of vertigo struck him, the world smaller. He found himself looking down at Jeff, the previously imposing tiger now a few inches shorter than he was.<br />
<br />
His mind whirled. <br />
<br />
The big cat’s head felt lighter and it was taking him longer to organize his thoughts, like they were muffled and sluggish. But at the same time, the worries that had plagued him just weren’t there anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, buddy?&quot; Jeff asked, steadying Ryan with a smile.<br />
<br />
“No…” Ryan struggled to put his feelings into words, “I, uh, feel dizzy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re probably dehydrated. Here,” Jeff shoved a two-liter bottle of spring water into Ryan’s paw. “Drink this.”<br />
<br />
The lion guzzled down the refreshing water and felt a little better, the world not wavering as much.<br />
<br />
Jeff held him steady the whole while. <br />
<br />
Ryan subconsciously leaned against the massive tiger, his only rock in the small, confusing world that he suddenly found himself in. He couldn’t help but look at the tiger, his massive pecs like a shelf, so very self-assured.  The lion was suddenly aware of the big wet cum stain on the front of his jeans and blushed under his fur, feeling embarrassed and dirty. <br />
<br />
“Feeling better?” Jeff asked, pulling Ryan out of his murky thoughts.<br />
<br />
Ryan kind of did, but still, something niggled in his greatly reduced brain. He couldn’t come up with the right words, so he just let out a grunt of assent. <br />
<br />
“Good, come on, we’re stinking up the place.” Jeff winked and led the big lion away from the bench press.<br />
<br />
The two massively muscled anthros sauntered towards the back, both reeking of sweat and musk. Ryan felt so big and tough, but also strangely vulnerable, and clung to the tiger closely. They entered the locker room and passed by a row of sinks and mirrors. <br />
<br />
Ryan saw something in the reflection out of the corner of his eyes that caught his attention.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! He’s…” Ryan exclaimed, before pausing as he stared at the buff but confused looking lion in the mirror. <br />
<br />
“Uh…” Ryan felt his tongue loll out of his mouth, while the lion in the mirror did the same.<br />
<br />
“Really hot!” <br />
<br />
The lion in the mirror was a heaving mass of muscles that put Jeff to shame. His muzzle was blunt and bestial, with heavy brows that jut over deep-set, sparkling blue eyes and a huge, majestic toasty brown mane framed his face. A large bulge stuck out lewdly at the crotch of jeans that were so tight they looked like they had been painted on. The lion’s shirt was stretched across his torso, straining to contain the bulging muscles.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he sure is, Ryan,” Jeff said, stepping between Ryan and the mirror. <br />
<br />
The tiger groped the lion’s bulge and leaned in to kiss him. Ryan found himself bucking into the tiger’s paw and began making out with his best friend. Everything was so confusing, but Jeff… mmm… he was so hot. Ryan couldn’t help but let a deep purr rumble up out of his chest <br />
<br />
As they made out, Ryan looked over Jeff’s shoulder, only to see the backside of a muscular tiger who was making out with someone.  As a tawny tail swayed back and forth behind the tiger’s legs, Ryan realized that it must be the lion from before. <br />
<br />
His mind slowly and methodically started putting pieces of that puzzle together.  Jeff spun Ryan around so that he the mirror was off to his side.  Then, Jeff’s paws started unbuttoning Ryan’s too-tight jeans and yanked them off. As Jeff pulled Ryan’s shirt off, Ryan saw the handsome lion’s shirt get removed in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Look Jeff! That handsome lion is about to get a blowjob by a hot tiger!” Ryan said excitedly pointing at the mirror. “Ahhahaha! Whoa!”<br />
<br />
Jeff paused and stared up at Ryan, who stared back with only the dimmest hint of understanding in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I went too far.” <br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at Jeff, wondering why the tiger was looking at him like he was a moron. Then he looked back at the mirror. At the reflection in the mirror he and the tiger were standing in front of.<br />
<br />
Wait. <br />
<br />
The purring stopped. <br />
<br />
The lion stared at the two entwined gym-cats in the mirror. <br />
<br />
Wait! Oh shit, that was him! He was the hunky lion man in the mirror! <br />
<br />
Ryan pulled away from the tiger, staring at his reflection. <br />
<br />
That wasn’t him?  Was it?  Had he always been a lion? His body felt normal, but at the same time he couldn’t shake the feeling that something dramatic had happened to him.  There were so many thoughts in his mind, he couldn’t keep track of them.  It was like trying to cram too many cars on a one lane road – there just wasn’t enough space in his brain for it all, so his thoughts just came to a complete stop.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong, Ryan?” Jeff smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, um.” It took Ryan longer than it should have to piece the sentence together, his tongue stumbling over the words, leaving audible gaps in between. “Something happened. I think that I... that I changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
“You sure did, bud!” Jeff’s paw stroked the lion’s belly, pulling his too-tight shirt up and exposing his midriff. Ryan’s muscled stomach was covered in tawny hair, a trail of darker brown fur trailed up from his groin to the lion man’s chest. Jeff’s claws traced the ridges of Ryan’s deep, furry cum gutters before descending to the lion’s jeans, unbuttoning them and unzipping them. His jock sagged out, Ryan’s cock stretching the fabric near to bursting. <br />
<br />
“Don’t you like it?”<br />
<br />
“Like it?” Ryan repeated, not understanding the question, “Did you…? But I don’t remember…”<br />
<br />
“I thought this was what you wanted,” Jeff said, frowning. Seeing Jeff upset made Ryan feel bad, like he’d done something wrong. <br />
<br />
“You said you wanted to be a big cat. A lion, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but…” Ryan shook his head. <br />
<br />
He did remember that, though the memory was vague. It was all mostly just emotions, feelings of inadequacy and jealousy and resentment - they were bad feelings and he didn’t like them. But still, even with his duller mind, he knew there was something wrong with Jeff’s logic. He just… didn’t have the words or the time to formulate an argument. <br />
<br />
Jeff waited, watching the big cat struggle to form a coherent sentence.<br />
<br />
“This,” Ryan stammered, “it feels weird.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think I can make you feel better,” Jeff said. He pulled down the lion’s soggy jockstrap and Ryan’s huge cock sprung free, a foot long and thick as a beer can. The tiger held it in his paw as it twitched and throbbed, sticky with cum, and stroked it slowly. Ryan yowled and nearly came all over Jeff from his gentle touch alone. “Turn around.”<br />
<br />
“Ah! I, uh…” Ryan was so confused. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t gay, but the tiger was so hot and his paw felt so good. Jeff stared at him expectantly and so the lion turned around and bent over the sink, exposing his perfectly round ass. His tufted tail flicked to the side, exposing Ryan’s tight pink pucker to the cool locker-room air.<br />
<br />
“Bend over a bit more,” Jeff placed a paw between Ryan’s meaty shoulder and pressed down gently. <br />
<br />
Ryan found himself arching his back, his thickly muscled rump high in the air. As a human, it would be awkward, but his flexible feline spine made it comfortable.<br />
<br />
Behind him, Jeff was stripping, exposing his sweat-slicked striped fur. His erect cock wobbled heavily erect between his muscled legs. For some reason, Ryan wanted to lick it, taste it in his mouth. It was less a thought and more an urge.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s paws spread his cheeks wide. He bent over and sniffed Ryan’s hole. His cold, wet nostrils snuffled against Ryan’s pucker and the lion flinched. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you smell good. Nice and masculine and musky.” Jeff nodded his approval, lapping against the ring with his tongue.<br />
<br />
The tiger’s tongue lavished Ryan’s pucker with licks. Ryan huffed and writhed, muscles sliding under his fur as Jeff ate out his ass. Waves of pleasure radiated from his hole, and all he could do was grip the sink and pant hard.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned helplessly as Jeff worked his tight pucker open. Every once in a while, it would slip into his hole and brush past something that shot sparks of pure pleasure through Ryan’s body. As Ryan relaxed and enjoyed the feeling in his asshole, the tongue started slipping past his ring more and more often.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff gave Ryan’s hole one last lap, then he pulled away, tongue licking his chops.<br />
<br />
Jeff squared himself up behind the lion and stroked his flushed meat to full hardness. <br />
<br />
The tiger leaned forward, hotdogging his cock between Ryan’s cheeks and ran his hands over the lion’s new body. Jeff adjusted himself on the edge of the sink, the muscles in his arms bulging under his fur as he did so, rippling with every move he made. His body was so big and strong and furry. The tiger’s paws only emphasized that.<br />
<br />
“You turned out perfect, Ryan,” Jeff whispered in Ryan’s twitching ear. “A big, dumb, gym-cat.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Ryan felt so conflicted, but he felt so good. “You like me like this?”<br />
<br />
For some reason, he really wanted Jeff to say yes.<br />
<br />
“Ryan,” Jeff purred, gripping Ryan’s hips. “I love you like this.”<br />
<br />
The tiger thrust his cock into Ryan’s ass. <br />
<br />
Ryan’s eyes went wide as the tiger’s fat cockhead plowed into his ring and pressed past it. It stretched him wide and his mouth opened to scream. Then Jeff’s fat cock brushed past that special spot inside of him and all that came out was a mewl. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t just that it felt good-which it did-but it also felt right.<br />
<br />
All thoughts of being straight left him and he pushed back into Jeff’s fat cock as it slid deeper inside of the lion. The tiger’s cock was so big! The hot, throbbing pressure against the lion’s special spot kept shooting off sparks of pleasure as it pressed forward until Ryan hilted. <br />
<br />
When he drew back, a moan escaped the big cat’s maw, and then the tiger shoved his cock back in, his balls slapping against Ryan’s and the lion yowled in ecstasy. They mated, bucking back and forth against the sink, the lion writhing and spitting unable to control himself for long.<br />
<br />
“Jeff!” Ryan moaned, ”I’m!” The tiger reached around and gripped the lion’s dick with his rough pawpads and started jerking him off. Ryan glanced down, watching the tiger’s muscles bulge hugely as he worked the lion’s shaft. The sight of Jeff’s meaty paw curled around the lion’s fuckstick was too much for the big cat to handle and Ryan felt a roar rise up his throat.<br />
<br />
“Cum,” Jeff commanded, then bit down on the lion’s neck, claiming him.<br />
<br />
The tiger’s paw clenched and Ryan let out the roar that had been building in his throat.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the lion was squirting great gouts of seed that splattered all over the mirror and splashed into the sink. Jeff was cumming too, his cock spasming deep inside of the lion, filling Ryan with warmth and waves of pleasure as the tiger’s cock seized and pressed on his special spot.<br />
<br />
Ryan fell forward onto the sink, Jeff still balls deep and yowling as his cock kept twitching inside the lion. Then, at last, he collapsed on top of the lion. They panted together, enjoying the after glow.<br />
<br />
“Did that feel good?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ryan grunted.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled out and slapped Ryan’s ass. “Come on, let’s hit the showers. Then we’ll deal with the clothes problem.”<br />
<br />
“O-okay,” Ryan said.<br />
<br />
The tiger walked towards the showers and Ryan followed. The lion lumbered along behind the tiger, his heavy dick swinging. His gait was weird and his steps heavier than Ryan was used to. It was such a big, clumsy body, but the longer he was in it, the more comfortable he felt.</p>
