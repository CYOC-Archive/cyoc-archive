<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was interrupted from his thought by the laughing of the people who had now surrounded him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, weirdo!” Yelled a boy, maybe 17, wearing a black shirt with the words “Born to Be Wild” on it. <br />
<br />
Another boy, this one in his early twenties chimed in “Yeah, what’s up with that monkey!”<br />
<br />
A third person, this one a girl who appeared to be eighteen, had dark black hair, and was wearing a short sleeved red shirt with a black miniskirt, scolded the first two.<br />
<br />
“First off, it’s a weasel moron. And second off, that weasel probably has more class than you.”<br />
<br />
”Shut up Sheila!” Yelled another girl, who was wearing a white t-shirt and jeans. “You wouldn’t know class if it hit you on the head.”<br />
<br />
Ty, who had now been forgotten in their conversation, finally was able to talk.<br />
<br />
“Hey, leave us alone, we have justice to deliver!”<br />
<br />
The first boy chimed in, “’Justice to deliver,’ what are you batman?”<br />
<br />
The second boy pushed him, while the girl in the white t-shirt taunted him.<br />
<br />
“Gonna dispense some justice on us, punk?”<br />
<br />
Sheila, however, did not like the attitude of the first boy.<br />
<br />
“Yo, what are you? In first grade? Stop being stupid or you can just leave me!”<br />
<br />
He backed off, but the other two continued to taunt him. Finally the second boy pushed Ty into the wall of the brick building.<br />
<br />
“Where is your ‘justice.’?”<br />
<br />
Ty, however, did not wish to see any more of this.<br />
<br />
“Tell me, do you enjoy mocking”<br />
<br />
The girl responded in turn, “Do you enjoy it, you little brat?”<br />
<br />
Ty scanned their minds and found their names were Jeff and Liz, and that they were boyfriend and girlfriend. He then responded, “Very well, I hope you enjoy your new lives.”<br />
<br />
With that the two of them began to laugh, but quickly stopped when they felt tightness in their stomachs.<br />
<br />
They immediately fell to the ground, and looked for help. However, the only ones who showed concern were their two friends. Outside of that group, so far as the world was concerned, they did not even exist. Ty ensured that.<br />
<br />
“What… what are you doing to us?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
However, he couldn’t focus on the response as he had new problems to worry about.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was dryness on his legs, and also noted that the hair was missing from that area.<br />
<br />
Liz, however, had not noticed any changes to her legs, as she was more concerned with the hair falling out of their heads. <br />
<br />
Sheila and the first boy, who Ty found out was named Alex and was Sheila’s boyfriend, ran over to them, but Ty made them unable to move. Thus, they could not speak, but no changes were occurring, so far as they could tell.<br />
<br />
Jeff, who was lying on the ground, suddenly felt his abdominal muscles become much weaker, but felt a renewed sense of strength in his chest and arms. He also found himself breathing much more easily. However, he let out a shriek when he noticed his toes had begun to curve and the outside two toes had disappeared entirely. <br />
<br />
Liz, on the other hand, had begun screaming when she noticed her fingers and hand fuse into one large pointed appendage. However, this screaming was cut short when her lips and nose became very hard and stiff. <br />
<br />
As these changes occurred, Jeff noticed small whiffs appearing on his body. Initially he thought that it might be fur, but as he looked harder, he realized that he was sprouting feathers.<br />
<br />
All the while their nose had fused with their mouths and had begun protruding.<br />
<br />
At the moment they appeared to be human like, but with wings, talons, and a beak. However, the changes began working more quickly.<br />
<br />
They both immediately noticed their bodies becoming more oval in shape, and the feathers now covered their bodies. Soon they became too weak to hold up their own bodies, and nearly collapsed. However, their bones suddenly became hollow, and they could begin to stand.<br />
<br />
As the Liz began standing up, she observed her new body shape. She was somewhat gray, and had a more round head. Her eyes had changed from a blue to brown. Also, she noticed she had wings, and also realized that her clothes were getting tight from the feathers.<br />
<br />
Jeff too stood up, and realized they resembled a bird of some sort, but what. He pondered for a moment, but noticed Liz suddenly jerk backwards and fall as her pants were ripped open. He too felt a sudden push as a tail burst through his clothing and shredded his pants. <br />
<br />
The two now had tail feathers, and resembled birds mostly, except for the height.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked about, and began to despair. However, his crying was cut short by a strange pull in his crotch area. At first he thought he was becoming a female, but then realized that birds did not have external sex organs.<br />
<br />
It was after he recovered from that shock that he realized that Ty was taller than he thought, and growing. He tried to tell Liz that they were shrinking, but could not. <br />
<br />
Mockingbird. Jeff suddenly remembered the animal he thought he was becoming. He almost laughed at how it was fitting, but was then pulled back by a massive force as he was pulled down to a tiny size, less than a foot tall. <br />
<br />
As they began to open their mouths, they suddenly forgot how to speak. Now the chemicals in the brain were beginning to change. Jeff immediately gained new instincts, such as how to fly, and what to eat. In fact, he just now realized that he was very hungry.<br />
<br />
Soon after, as he glanced at Liz, he realized she was very attractive and had beautiful feathers. He caught himself, and realized that he wanted her to be his mate. No doubt his mind had been altered in some ways. Luckily, he thought, he still retained most of his mind, although he could no longer speak or remember much more than his own life. Math, science, and history were all but a dull memory at this point. <br />
<br />
Then the last change hit, and he felt massive amounts of instinct join into his brain as he began to see beautiful new colors with the final changes being applied to his eye. <br />
<br />
Ty threw down some seeds he had found in his pocket, and Jeff looked at the seeds and immediately ate them.<br />
<br />
Liz too now felt incredible urges and sensations, specifically for food and a mate. She found the bird who was Jeff to be very attractive to both sent and sight, and thought of having children.<br />
<br />
Suddenly their thoughts returned to Ty, as he allowed them to listen to him.<br />
<br />
“Well, I believe I shall teach you a bit about your new life. You see, I am not a cruel person. To begin with, you are now mockingbirds. You cannot talk, nor do most human things. However, you likely will not want to, for your desires, in spite of your memories which I have allowed you to keep, have changed. I’m sure you’ve noted them already. You are now ultimately going to live on instinct. You will eat what you see, which is good if you want to fly without starving. You will also be mates; for both your memories of each other will keep you together and the instincts I have given you will also do so, as you are both through sight and pheromones, extremely attractive to each other.”<br />
<br />
With that, Ty released his grip and watched the two birds fly away towards the woods in the south. They would go on, without Ty’s knowledge, to have five children together and be happy.<br />
<br />
However, Ty was still concerned with John, as well as Alex and Sheila.</p>
