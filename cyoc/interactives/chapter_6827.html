<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David and Matt searched through Daniel and Konrad's bags lying in the bottom of the closet. They seemed to be filled with sport's gear. &quot;That's right!&quot; exclamined Matt. &quot;We usually go to the gym together after our shift.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, let's let this work out be their best yet...&quot; David said with a smile.<br />
<br />
At 3:30 AM, Konrad woke. &quot;Hey Daniel, our shift's over, let's go.&quot;<br />
Daniel got up yawning. &quot;Alright, I'm coming...&quot;<br />
<br />
They both walked over to the closet and picked up their sports bags. &quot;Hey, where's Matt's?&quot; asked Daniel. &quot;Must've left already,&quot; replied Konrad.<br />
<br />
They reached the All Hours Gym not long later. They both checked in and walked to the change rooms. They both began to get changed, but as Konrad reached into the bag for his shirt, he felt his hand rub against a smooth material that gave him a boner just by touching it. He pulled out what the cause of his boner. It was a pair of red Speedos. Shit, he never owned a pair of Speedos as he assumed they were just for fags, but if they felt this good, what could possibly be wrong with them?<br />
<br />
He put them back in the bag, but then realised he had a second pair of the same type also buried below his clothes. This gave him an idea. He desperately wanted to try on the over pair, but he wouldn't let Daniel see him as he didn't want him thinking he was gay or anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how about we go for a swim?&quot; Konrad asked. &quot;Hmm...I DO feel like a swim, but I don't have any bathers to wear in the pool,&quot; replied Daniel. &quot;Hey, don't worry. I have a second pair of Speedos with me,&quot; Konrad offered. &quot;Speedos? What are you doing with Speedos?&quot; Daniel asked with one eyebrow raised. &quot;Hey, I like to race and stay fit, and Speedos let you go so much faster than while wearing shorts,&quot; replied Konrad. &quot;So, do you want to borrow a pair, or are you afriad of losing to me?&quot; Not wanting to seem chicken, Daniel grabbed one of the pairs of Red Speedos. He and Konrad both slid into their pairs and pulled a towel out of their bags. &quot;Hey, do you shave your chest or something?&quot; Konrad asked Daniel. &quot;No...&quot; Daniel replied, but then checking down his chest was bare. &quot;Hey, speak for yourself,&quot; Daniel responded, looking up at Konrad. &quot;Huh..?&quot; Konrad looked down and noticed his entire body, spare his head, was completely hair less.<br />
<br />
Daniel noticed he couldn't stop staring at Konrad's chest...he distracted himself by looking down at his Speedo. He considered for a moment tightening the draw string, but then realised his man hood filled it fine and was pushing against the tight material. He tried to make it obvious for Konrad to see by stretching widely and bending over to touch his toes a couple of times. Konrad noticed and felt his own penis growing, but he assumed he was just getting a little horny. He didn't try to make an excuse for what his boner was caused by, he was too busy thinking about squeezing Daniel's ass through the red fabric. He and Daniel walked up to each other and were about to kiss when someone entered the room. They quickly caught themselves and walked back over to their bags. A man entered, around 34. He introduced himself as Mike Mc Carthy, a senior school PE teacher who worked nearby. &quot;Hey, are you two guys going swimming?&quot; he asked, noticing the Speedos. &quot;Mind if I join? I don't want to use the excercise bike alone, it gets a little boring,&quot; he continued as he pulled off his shirt and tossed it on the bench near his bag. His eyes darted around the room at Daniel's and Konrad's Speedos, and he looked back into his bag. &quot;Ah, here it is...&quot; he said as he pulled out a Speedo. It was mainly royal blue, except on both sides it had a couple of inches of the same bright red, and across the back it had the BGS across the back in red letters. &quot;Heh, I got one of my school's speedos as I get a discount on the uniforms. If I had the money I'd probably buy another pair, but on my salary...&quot; Mike finished with a laugh.  He slid into his pair, and checked himself in the mirror. That was when it happened.<br />
<br />
The Speedo Mike was wearing was already reacting, as it was already absorbing the fag germs from Daniel and Konrad's presence as all speedos were considered to be homosexual. He grimaced and grabbed his chest. Konrad and Daniel immediately ran to help, but as they touched his muscly arms, they felt their boners growing again. They watched as Mike's Speedo began to fill up more and Mike smiled at this. They couldn't hold it in any longer. They instantly began rubbing themselves against each other, kissing and rubbing and fondling each other's entire bodies. They didn't notice as Mike's speedo changed to completely Red and grow a bit tighter or that their muscles suddenly began to develop a lot more. They were too busy with each other to care right now...</p>
