<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m entitled to one knot pun title in a series named Washington Wolves, I think.  Yes?  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If you are plural, know that I am not... and I tried my best.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christopher Brown&#39;s blue jeans were trapped around his legs.  Ripped apart from the inside and barely holding together from the expansive muscle growth, they were now like denim handcuffs around his ankles.  As his white furred scrotum full with two basketball-sized testicles hung back behind his legs, he chuckled.  Troubled as he was earlier that his balls had to be uncomfortably shoved into his pants, he knew now for certain they&#39;d never fit.  He basically had the stance of a cowboy after riding bareback all day.<br />
<br />
Andrew Farminga leaned back against Christopher&#39;s sticky black, Cloak-brand shirt which was plastered by Harry Taggert&#39;s cum as well as his own.  The amount of sexual activity Chris had gotten into back on the bus what felt like hours ago—when it was closer to just one—was extraordinary by his measure.  He wasn&#39;t a &#39;player&#39; like Gary Lambert or a as sexually demanding as Matthew Shrewsberry.  Christopher was just a high schooler who had had few relationships, none of which had panned out.<br />
<br />
The now twenty-one inches of his red lupine penis seemed like it would be too much to handle, but apparently not for Andrew who&#39;s internal organs had no trouble pushing away from his vagina&#39;s demanding size.  The now only slightly smaller young man&#39;s internals were flexing against Chris&#39; length as if continually testing it to see if it was getting soft.  Though, if Christopher was being honest, he had no idea how to measure twenty-one inches hard versus six foot seven in height.  Was it proportional now?  He doubted it.<br />
<br />
The khaki shreds which used to be pants hung from the waistline of Andrew as he hugged his hands together against his chest.  Directly below that waistline his new hybridized human-wolf legs no longer fit inside those shreds.  Black fur covered his now somewhat bubble-butt with a black tail pushed out to one side contrasting over Christopher&#39;s white fur.  His cheap, Wal-Mart kahki&#39;s had come apart vertically and looked more like a poor attempt to make them into some kind of business hula skirt than actual pants.  A solid amount of cloth was kept mostly together at the front where his pants had ripped vertical along the outsides with his still human crotch hiding behind them like some kind of sudo-loincloth.<br />
<br />
Andy had zipped up the front of his pants just in case anyone came into the bathroom, but the bulge at his front would leave nothing to the imagination.  As he idly rubbed his fingers over the crease in his skin where Christopher&#39;s penis pressed out from the inside, it became clear to the taller man behind him that something was troubling him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, uh.  You said &#39;Absolutely&#39; but we&#39;re just standing here,&quot; offered Chris.  &quot;Man, I know this is so bizarre.  This whole situation is fucked,&quot; he said, then tried not to smirk.  <i>There certainly is a lot of fucking happening,</i> he thought, but then spoke again: &quot;I hope there&#39;s no lasting repercussions... and sorry about the, uh, puppy thing.  We were both a lot more high on the moment then, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Farminga sighed.  He didn&#39;t know how to say what he wanted to say, so he kept quiet for the moment.  But this didn&#39;t work for Christopher who went on:<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy, c&#39;mon.  You know me.  If... if something were to happen and you actually got pregnant, I wouldn&#39;t leave you behind.  As a sexually active teenager, I&#39;ve accepted that someone might poke a hole in a condom or something.  Like... shit, I&#39;ve never told anyone this, but my second girlfriend basically... I mean... she drugged me and... I thought for sure for weeks I was going to be a father because her period was late afterwards... ever since then I&#39;ve been prepared for the possibilit—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were raped?&quot; Andrew realized what Christopher implied and leaned back to look up towards his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean.  Uh.  Can guys even <i>be</i> raped?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew blinked, his mouth opening slowly for just a moment as he wondered what kind of upbringing could beget that question.  Shaking his head as if to free it from that unspoke history, he simply responded: &quot;Yes, Christopher.  And they don&#39;t need a pussy for it to happen either—&quot; but Andrew quickly realized his implication and regretted it at once. &quot;Not that you did!  That&#39;s not what hap—&quot; he grumbled.  &quot;I mean, you were there—here—you know what happened.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;If you were drugged, that implies rape.  Doubly so if she was older and you were underaged...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember Rachel Kolchek?&quot; Christopher asked with a deep sigh.  Andrew shook his head.  He couldn&#39;t say he&#39;d ever heard that name before.  &quot;Well, her parents checked her into a mental institution in—oh, my bad, dude.  That happened while you were, uh.  You were away.  She never came back from Christmas Break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Away,&quot; Andy said distractedly, then realized the white-haired man meant &#39;in Belarus&#39; which by extension, meant <i>here</i>.  At least, that&#39;s part of what Andrew was dwelling on for the last few minutes.  He grumbled, though, and explained as much: &quot;Chris, I was <i>here</i>.  Christmas 2018, me and my family were <i>here</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher&#39;s hands hugged Andy close to him, as he sniffed his hair.  &quot;You don&#39;t know that.  But you did lose your family, so I&#39;m sorry I brought it up.  I can&#39;t imagine what it would&#39;ve been like in a coma.  Movies always romanticize comas... in a lot of ways, but—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christopher,&quot; Andrew said, but firmly.  The slightly larger man deferred, like a wolf might to one of higher station in their pack.  Andy took a moment to collect himself, then spoke: &quot;I&#39;ve been knotted before.  This has all happened before.  Not tonight, but some other time.&quot;  He took a breath.  &quot;Another time but definitely <i>this</i> place.  I have this feeling I almost died... and... and that living as I did felt... <i>wrong.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Since they were still knotted together, Chris locked inside Andy&#39;s vagina.  &quot;Can we sit?&quot; he asked.  Andrew nodded.  The two men waddled, locked together by Christopher&#39;s knot, taking up a seat on the bench Emily had eaten Zelda out on.  The larger man leaned back on the bench, pulling Andy into his lap as he did so.  The two were just a few inches of height apart, but based on how they were locked together, it was a bit awkward.  The paw pads of Andy&#39;s canine feet sat atop Chris&#39; white sneakers.<br />
<br />
Running a hand through his now messy white hair, Chris ended up with his hands down behind him on the seat, propping up his back as Andy sat in his lap.  &quot;So...&quot; he began slowly.  &quot;You didn&#39;t want to live?&quot; he asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I said,&quot; Andrew&#39;s stern tone returned.  &quot;I said living... like I did, like I have... it&#39;s felt wrong.&quot;  He took in a deep breath, then let it out slow.  &quot;I mean, yes, initially there were several weeks after I came back where I wondered what the point of it all was.  Like, I don&#39;t believe in god.  Not that I don&#39;t have faith, it&#39;s just not in sky-daddy, yeah?&quot;  He asked, but pressed on without answer.  &quot;But if my whole family is dead.  And my friends wouldn&#39;t talk to me... then what was the point in existence?  I just... I don&#39;t believe surviving—simply drawing breath—is living...&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher leaned his head back against the wall.  &quot;I barely knew you then.  Like, you were a year ahead of me and we didn&#39;t share any classes and, like... I was an average football player so I wasn&#39;t on varsity...&quot; he trailed off.  &quot;What I&#39;m trying to say is... I wish I wasn&#39;t one of those kids who cares more about people they know rather than... everyone, but I <i>was</i>... well, still kind of am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me <i>now.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Inside and out,&quot; Christopher chuckled, hugging Andy a bit tighter.  Andrew blushed.  &quot;Are we still being honest about sex stuff or is this not a good time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Andrew coaxed, not actually certain he was ready for what Chris had to say while they were in this compromised position.<br />
<br />
&quot;After that close one with Rachel, I&#39;ve been scared of having kids... or of someone, kind&#39;a, tricking me into kids.  But,&quot; Christopher sniffed Andy&#39;s hair again.  &quot;I think I&#39;d like to... with you... like this,&quot; he said.  Andrew grew a little more wet on his nether-lips.  &quot;And... in my mind, I realize that can&#39;t be true.  But... it&#39;s like that&#39;s what the body wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew took a long breath, his nose pushing out ever so slightly from his face.  &quot;Rachel missed her period, you said?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher sighed.  &quot;Rachel&#39;s parents talked one of her personalities into getting an abortion.&quot;<br />
<br />
A growl started in Andrew&#39;s throat.  He didn&#39;t know Rachel.  He didn&#39;t know how young she&#39;d been, or if she was the type of multiple personality disorder which was dangerous.  He didn&#39;t know if she&#39;d have been a good mother.  He didn&#39;t even really have a strong opinion on abortion.  Not one enough to get violent over it anyway.  But something in that moment creeped in and made him angry...<br />
<br />
Black fur bled downward from under Andrew&#39;s head of black hair, covering his neck.  The growl grew and rumbled against Christopher who, for his part, began to slink down against the wall with the impression he&#39;d done something wrong.  Claws of yellow with black at their base replaced Andy&#39;s fingernails... and all he could think about in that moment was some other wolf—parent&#39;s or not—coming into his territory and killing his children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy,&quot; Christopher whimpered softly.  Leaning in, Chris placed his face alongside Andy&#39;s and licked the black wolf&#39;s new muzzle.  Triangular ears shifted backward on Andrew&#39;s head, listening to Chris speak.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong...?  You&#39;re changing... if you don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s growl stifled.  &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; he said, looking down at his hands.  He reached up to his chest to feel mounds pushing up into his hands.  &quot;Help me take my shirt off?&quot; he asked.  Christopher obliged, getting off the white undershirt and tossing it into the corner of the floor with Andy&#39;s jacket.  As he did so, Andy&#39;s breasts kept growing.<br />
<br />
Christopher couldn&#39;t resist putting hands up over Andy&#39;s new breasts as fur began to bleed down from his neckline.  There was concern in his voice: &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m Therian,&quot; Andy said simply, referring to the conversation they&#39;d had before they&#39;d found any of the journals.  &quot;Seamus is lucky now, I get it.  A fox-spirit born into a human body, cursed to become what he feels inside?  That makes sense to me,&quot; he said.  &quot;You talk about how this isn&#39;t want you want, and you&#39;re resisting what the body wants,&quot; Andrew said... &quot;And I talked myself into believing that, but it&#39;s just not true...&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher reached down between Andy&#39;s legs with one hand, the other wrapped around his stomach.  &quot;What are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of how I know I&#39;ve been here before... that quiet I had after I said we could absolutely fool around...&quot; Andrew trailed off, then started again.  He looked around the bathroom and thought this was the weirdest place to have a moment... but they couldn&#39;t exactly show themselves off to everyone like this... or could they?  Andy shook his head, words softly leaving his lips:<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember thinking... I had a werewolf tail... because that made sense,&quot; And said.  &quot;Werewolves have made a lot of sense to me ever since I got back.&quot;  He grumbled.  &quot;Every few weeks, I&#39;d toss and turn at night... visions of wooded space, a clearing that wasn&#39;t for me, and a cave where I would give birth to my young.  I was a mother wolf, and that would feel right,&quot; he explained.  &quot;Whatever happened to me in this place changed me... I wasn&#39;t the same kid when I got back.  Like I was caged animal and my <i>body</i> was the cage...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but you don&#39;t know that happened,&quot; Christopher spoke, but he wasn&#39;t sure.  Andrew sounded convinced, and something about their now animal natures made Chris want to trust this more experienced wolf.  He didn&#39;t understand it because of human words.  He understood it by the tone and feeling placed into them, like the meaning behind a howl.<br />
<br />
Christopher was also transforming... as Andy grew more wolfen, so too did Christopher change.  The first white fur since his balls and sheath began to bleed out from his hands.  They bulked up too, black paw pads pushing out from within the palm of his hands and underside of his fingers.  Reaching out, he held onto Andrew&#39;s hands from the back of his wrist.  Those tiny human hands with claws dwarfed by the big wolf paws Chris had now attained.<br />
<br />
Andrew took in a deep breath as his internal muscles tested Christopher&#39;s knot again, finding it just as large as it had been.  Leaning back, this black muzzle opened and his new, longer tongue licked up under Chris&#39; face.  Nuzzling into the larger man&#39;s neck, Andrew found it easier to speak:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what it is I&#39;m becoming... but it&#39;s not a wolf, man.  It&#39;s something human and wolf, male and female, strong an agile, and most importantly... me.&quot;  He let a warm breath out against Chris&#39; chest.  &quot;But... I don&#39;t want this for you.  You&#39;ve got a good heart, and I don&#39;t want to force this on you and, besides, I&#39;m just human enough to admit the likeliness it could ever be just you and me in this place is very low.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher squeezed Andy&#39;s smaller hands in his.  &quot;I wonder if anyone&#39;s ever fought lust with love?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew stopped what he was doing.  Looking at his hands in Christophers, he realized what he was doing.  He was going to take Chris again and again until there were nothing left of their minds... and that could <i>not</i> happen.  He was the alpha, though he didn&#39;t internally use that word.  He knew all these people were his pack, and if he&#39;d escaped before, they could all escape this time...<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I love you, Christopher... but I love other people too.  I love my friends, I love my school, and no matter how much I want to be selfish and get fucked so I stay like I am now... people need me.  People need <i>us,&quot;</i> he realized.  &quot;C&#39;mon.  We have to calm ourselves.  We already know changes can revert.  Nobody has to die...&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher hugged Andy tight with his knot still tying them together.  &quot;Sharing the love, huh?&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;Very polyamorous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Andrew blinked as his fur started to fade away from his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know that word.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris smirked.  &quot;From poly meaning many and amour meaning lovers,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;Means open relationships, bro.  Like, you&#39;ve got to be consenting and know all the partners of your partners.  It&#39;s not, like, fucking anyone.  It&#39;s, you know, a group of people who all agree to be with each other as adults.&quot;  Andrew was quiet, but not because he was opposed... he&#39;d just never thought of it before.  Before the last two hours, he was ace... no sexual interest in other people.  Now... now it seemed like he had a sexual interest everyone?<br />
<br />
No, not everyone.  He wasn&#39;t interested in Matthew or Mrs. Ann or Officer Dowd... just his closest friends.  Was that pansexual?  No... he liked other people&#39;s personalities but he didn&#39;t think he was turned on by them.  No, if he was looking for a word to land on it might be demisexual... sexual interest only in his closest friends... people he had deep connection to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think my sexual orientation has changed,&quot; Andy realized aloud, but softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t let it go to my head,&quot; Christopher let out a hearty chuckle, he body having mostly returned to his previous normal established after the group sex they&#39;d had a few minutes earlier.  &quot;Though I think mind&#39;s changed too.  Dunno if there&#39;s a name for &#39;attracted to wolves&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew laughed.  &quot;More specific than zoophilia, huh?  Lycanphilia, maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell are you guys talking about?&quot; asked a voice from somewhere behind the entrance wall.  The two men had been broken from their arousal, even while Andy was locked in place in Christopher&#39;s lap.  But the two looked up at the same time as heading something moving along the tile flooring that wasn&#39;t footsteps.<br />
<br />
Lyall MacKenzie, in a wheelchair, was rolling their way into the bathroom.  They were wearing a black hoodie with red outline.  Their chair had all-turrain treads on it as they were known to go hiking and only had the one chair.  They had on their black boots over red socks, and their pants were black jeans.  Atop their head was a black and red beret.  And, notably, they did have a rather larger, dark brown and red wolf tail out the crack between their chair&#39;s seat and back.<br />
<br />
They looked over at them, fixing the circular red glasses on their face, they took in the sight of Andrew sitting on Christopher&#39;s lap.  &quot;Huh,&quot; was all they initially said while wondering why Andy was shirtless until they realized what that bulge in the front of his torso must have been.  &quot;Oh, what the fuck guys?&quot; they asked, putting up a hand to block their view before they turned their head to look away.  &quot;I knew Chris was bi, but you too, A?  Like, this is a public bathroom, ya know?  Yer lucky we&#39;re the only ones who&#39;ve come in the last few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew shrugged.  &quot;Unless you want to help pull me out, I&#39;m kinda of stuck.&quot;  Lyall gave a shuttering reaction with their upper body.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just going to gloss over &#39;we&#39;?&quot; Christopher asked.  Those blue eyes looked out towards Lyall.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re plural,&quot; Andrew said to Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;So was Rachel,&quot; the white-haired man said.<br />
<br />
Lyall tried to meet Christopher&#39;s eyes, but honestly the look of him tied up in Andrew was rather disturbing to their vision.  A wolf in her mind said it was natural, but Lyall frowned and looked away.  &quot;Rachel Kolchek was plural, sure, but she was dissociative.  We&#39;re not.  We&#39;ve been over this, Chris, you fucking bigot.&quot;  Chris actually growled at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa!&quot; Andrew said, putting his hands up.  &quot;Just hold on a second.&quot;  He leaned back.  &quot;Chris, I only just heard about Rachel for the first time tonight, but is <i>she</i> why you and Lyall fight all the time?&quot; Andrew inquired.  &quot;Lyall&#39;s not crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher lifted his head quick enough you might think he&#39;d been slapped.  <i>&quot;What!?&quot;</i> he couldn&#39;t believe it.  &quot;She... <i>they</i> think they&#39;re three people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyall corrected him: &quot;Two women and a male wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s crazy!&quot; he repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, I&#39;m literally some kind of mutant wolf-monster on the inside and now the outside, and you can&#39;t understand there&#39;s three people in one body as opposed to one?&quot;  Andrew stopped talking and looked at Lyall.  &quot;Am I... overstepping by explaining?  I can never be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyall smirked at Andy, their eyes narrowed a bit as she glanced at Christopher.  &quot;You&#39;ve come a long way from pushing my chair without asking permission, Andy, but no... feel free to go on.  Chris and I have already had this conversation before, so feel free to be the in-between,&quot; they said.  &quot;I need to empty my bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they turned and rolled their wheel over towards the handicapped stall.  Pausing near the sinks, they stared at the blood and guts of tail bones up against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Those are James&#39;,&quot; Andy said over to Lyall.  They looked back and raised one eyebrow very high.  &quot;There&#39;s like a spell on him or something... it&#39;s stopping him from taking the full brunt of the curse.  Instead of keeping a tail, he grows one and then it explodes.&quot;  Both their eyebrows went up.  &quot;We think he transferred his curse to Emily too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyall shook their head.  &quot;Emily got cursed with us.  We were both cheering...&quot; they said.  &quot;Also, she totally said &#39;fox&#39; after Christopher did... you know, back when you were all talking at the podium?  You had an audience.  I was in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew blinked.  &quot;Did we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher grumbled.  &quot;Shit, we are so bad at this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyall turned and started rolling the last few feet to the stall they&#39;d been aiming at a second ago.  &quot;The &#39;not naming animals&#39; thing and also the &#39;plural are people too&#39; thing, yeah,&quot; they said.  &quot;You do suck at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;His plural girlfriend was... unwell,&quot; said Andy without going into more detail.  &quot;Chris, please.  I&#39;ve known Lyall for years... and while neither of us had the words for what they are for most of that time, please try to understand their relationship with their other selves is... symbiotic probably isn&#39;t the right word.  But it&#39;s healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think symbiotic might be apt,&quot; remarked Lyall from the stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Symbiotic, then,&quot; Andy concurred.<br />
<br />
Chris didn&#39;t say anything.  As open as he was earlier, this was hard to reconcile.  The group sat in semi-silence... only the sound of Lyall&#39;s bag emptying into the toilet bowl could be heard.  Meanwhile, Christopher&#39;s mood had been ruined such that his shaft up inside of Andy had begun to go soft... and by the time Lyall was exiting the stall, Christopher was able to put his hands on Andrew&#39;s furry bubble butt and push upwards.<br />
<br />
Some white goop came out in a sticky, pouring sound onto Christopher&#39;s lap as Andrew stood up with Chris&#39; help.  The &#39;loin cloth&#39; of pants covered his front as he stood on his powerful new canine legs.  That full height of six foot four really made him tower over Lyall more than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about being shirtless,&quot; Andrew said as he moved over to the corner where the rest of his cloths were.  Lyall spared a look over to Christopher who&#39;s red tapered shaft had receded so that it only just barely poked out of his sheath a little.  Of course, a little was relative, and two inches out was still a fair amount.<br />
<br />
Their eyes turned to look at Andrew who was bending over, seemingly unaware that his tail simply wanted to be up and showing off his triangular-shaped mound to the others in the bathroom.  Somewhere inside of Lyall, the male wolf—Dakota—raised his head while simultaneously growing testicles on Lyall that she couldn&#39;t feel while it was happening.  A glance at Christopher confirmed a bit of jealousy in Dakota&#39;s mind.  In the next moment, Andrew turned around with his shirt and jacket in hand, unaware of the show he had given the other wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Andrew asked as he pulled his shirt on over his still mostly human torso.  His upper body was still human... all but those additional eight nipples below his original two.  Subconsciously, he may have realized what was happening, because he tied his assistant coach&#39;s jacket around his waist, with the back of it hanging behind him to hide his rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Lyall said, though they were blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I a sexy wolf, Dakota?&quot; Andrew found himself asking Lyall who, in turn, smiled.<br />
<br />
Lyall translated for Dakota, the male wolf she shared a headspace with: &quot;Wolves don&#39;t think in terms of sexy, Andy.  Does she smell right, does she present, does she accept advances...&quot;  They grinned.  &quot;But Dakota&#39;s an old wolf had more years watching than most wolves as newly adult as he... and he&#39;s never even had the chance to fuck just like I haven&#39;t, so... if he could, and if you were offering...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Christopher said, then seemed to regret it.  Andrew and Lyall both looked at him.  It had sounded like he objected, but what was he objecting to?  Andrew and he had been part of some spell-reflected, super-powered lust wave.  Did he really think of Andrew as his?  Honestly, yes.  Could he share?  Maybe.  <i>Quick, redirect the moment!</i> he yelled internally.<br />
<br />
Christopher&#39;s eyes went wide as he realized something.  &quot;Hey, hey,&quot; he tried to make it seem like his original objection just had a delay: &quot;What about the others hit with the mega-lust?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Didn&#39;t it seem like Mr. Eddington and Mr. Katz just starting making out out of nowhere when James looked at them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Lyall remarked as Andy tightened his belt around his new thicc waist.  &quot;I guess you guys wouldn&#39;t know what happened to Coach Banks...&quot;  Christopher and Andrew both looked at each other, then back at Lyall as they rolled up to them.  &quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; they said, leading them out into the main lobby.  &quot;You&#39;ve got to see this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher was struggling to pull his jeans up over his his now thicker legs.  In truth, he was able to make them work, but only because his jeans had originally been a size too big for him, held on by a belt.  Now they were a size or two too small, tight, and form-fitting.  His cock and balls were featured prominently at the front, absolutely impossible to hide.<br />
<br />
Glancing up at Andrew, he realized his answer.  Retrieving his varsity jacket from where it ended up on the floor, he wrapped it around his front so that the jacket&#39;s back was over the front of his giant sack.  Tying the sleeves around his back, he&#39;d done the best that could be expected to hid his sizable assets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congrats,&quot; Andrew smirked.<br />
<br />
Lyall rolled their eyes.  &quot;Yeah.  You both only look seventy percent ridiculous now.&quot;  They huffed, then began rolling their way back out of the bathroom with Andrew and Christopher right behind.</p>
