<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Animalia, Alice&#39;s life was full of marginal frustration. She was just on the edge being considered attractive. She had clear skin, blonde hair, and pale blue eyes. If her genetics had just been a little kinder, she would have been an Arian beauty. However, when it came to her weight, that was where she rolled snake eyes. She was born with a leptin deficiency that always kept a layer of fat on her body. No matter how much she dieted or exercised, she could never shed. It was particularly frustrating in that she knew she could be beautiful she didn&#39;t always looked so bloated.<br />
<br />
Though Alice isn&#39;t the only one coming to Animalia because of a leptin deficiency. Martha Kenward, wife of deputy mayor Robbie and one of the top models in Animalia, had a leptin problem before she became a vixen. Compared to Alice, she was actually worse off. But she knew what it was like to have irremovable fat so she was happy to sponsor Alice&#39;s conversion.<br />
<br />
The main problem was figuring out which animal she would become. It wasn&#39;t a decision to make lightly, there were no do-overs with the Animalian virus. However, after a bit of thought, Alice came to an answer. She wanted to be something more unique, most likely to make up for the lack of respect she had for years. So she was going to be a fish, though not just any fish. She liked the koi fish her parents kept in their pond because of their dazzling colors. She wanted something as appealing to the eye as them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, with the advances made in Animalia Aquatica, conversions into fish Animalians have become quite easy. Before long, Alice was in a changing room, waiting for her dosage. Presently, Judy came into the room. &quot;Well, here you are, miss...&quot; She paused when she saw Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to wear that?&quot; asked Judy.<br />
<br />
Alice looked down at her one-piece swimsuit and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to turn into a fish. It seems like a proper thing to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would, but you realize you&#39;re not going to stay the same shape for very long,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Especially with the tail you&#39;ll be growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;ll be easy to get out of,&quot; said Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true,&quot; said Judy. Then she injected Alice with the solution and said, &quot;Welcome to Animalia.&quot; With that, she left to give Alice some privacy.<br />
<br />
Alice soon began to feel very strange. She felt a little colder than then warmer. Then she noticed the scales starting to appear on her skin. There were red scales on some parts and blue on the other. Alice wondered what pattern she&#39;d end up with when there was a very loud gurgle from her stomach. She bent over and clutched at herself. As she was holding herself, she noticed there was a little less to hold. She could feel her layer of fat shrinking. She felt like a water balloon that was slowly leaking. But matter didn&#39;t just disappear and she soon felt a strong surge in her back. Sooner than she expected, the back of her swimsuit burst open as her new tail grew out. It appeared her body was using her extra fat to fuel the growth of her tail faster than normal.<br />
<br />
As her tail grew and her fat shrank, the swimsuit was starting to fit Alice less and less. But it wasn&#39;t just getting loose. Her hips were getting wider, probably to help her move her tail more. And while her butt was getting less flabby, it wasn&#39;t getting much smaller. It was becoming quite firm now, the padding only accenting its curvature. And her breasts had been handfuls before, though shapeless and saggy because of her excessive weight. But they were becoming rounder and perky, putting more stress on the swimsuit. Alice decided to slip the ripped swimsuit off to get a look at her new body.<br />
<br />
Her body was already quickly leaving the portly figure she&#39;s known for so long. Now she was looking more like a supermodel, her waist now tiny and her ass and breasts much more pert. The scales have spread over most of her body. Curiously, most of her scales ended up being deep blue, though her chest had become bright red. She could see stripes and dots of red across her shoulders and upper arms. Looking at her back, she noticed the new fin that grown as well as the large red spot. She studied the webbing between her fingers and toes and examined herself in the mirror. Her face extended very slightly out, her nose had flattened, and her lips were much larger. But she could still see herself. Her blue eyes and blonde hair made it easier to recognize her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my skin might not be Arian white anymore,&quot; said Alice as she hefted up her bright red breasts, &quot;But I think I still look pretty good.&quot; Of course, she wasn&#39;t intending on being a model or dancer. She was planning on becoming a corporate executive. But then, no one would fault her if she had a little fun first, right? She posed in front of the mirror, admiring her new figure. She was quite a tasty little fish now.</p>
