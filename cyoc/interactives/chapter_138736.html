<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle Perkins was feeling awfully pleased with himself. That bully of a cheerleader will finally get her comeuppance. He realized one glaring flaw when he began to smell this divine aroma. Was that Jennifer? Kyle&#39;s pants stiffen as Jennifer&#39;s overpowering mare-in-heat pheromones flow through the window. From the uncomfortable shifts of his classmates, it&#39;s apparent Kyle isn&#39;t the only one effected, either.<br />
<br />
Jennifer barely gets onto the bus on time. Her cheerleader uniform appears almost immaculate... except she doesn&#39;t even realize when her tail pulls her skirt up and flashes her classmates. There are a few looks; but none of them draw attention to Jennifer&#39;s lack of underwear. Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief once she&#39;s on the bus. She looks around for a seat, and stares in contempt when the only open seat one the bus is next to Kyle. A soft grin crosses Jennifer&#39;s lips as she realizes her opportunity for revenge. She takes step after victorious step. Jennifer sneezes once, and stumbles. She could feel hair growing down her neck, spreading her long, strawberry-blond hair down her neck and back, into a rather regal-looking mane. All right. Maybe she could get used to this.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s eyes widen as he realizes where the only place Jennifer may sit is. He just saw her sneeze. Those are horse ears; and that smell is estrus. Maybe Kyle had always wanted this...? But even so, Kyle realized Jennifer knew about the curse, now! If she was angry, there were all sorts of things which could be done to humiliate, or transform him. Worst case scenario she could dare him to jump off a bridge, or overpass. Dare isn&#39;t an option. Would she really be so cruel, though? Kyle realizes he&#39;s out of time to debate as Jennifer stands next to the only remaining seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; Jennifer coughs and gestures to Kyle&#39;s backback. Hesitantly, the wretch reaches for, and pulls his backpack from the seat, to free the spot for Jennifer. She smiles at Kyle silently for a very long moment. He figuratively shrinks under Jennifer&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
The bus pulls out from it&#39;s spot and gets moving before Kyle finally says something. &quot;H-Hi, J-J-Jennifer... No hard f-feelings, right...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Jennifer&#39;s plots for revenge soon find themselves hazing under the fog that heat in her womb casts over her thoughts. &quot;Transform or Dare...!&quot; Jennifer manages to stammer out, before suddenly sneezing all over Kyle, his seat, backpack, and the window behind Kyle. She moons everyone behind her, as she sneezes. Half of the bus gets to enjoy the show, but don&#39;t seem to realize to enjoy it as Jennifer&#39;s vulva plumps out and the front of it swells into a scrotum, while her clit swells up, quickly reaching six inches. It pulls her skirt up, forcing her to look down at it. It&#39;s a horse cock. It&#39;s small for a horse cock; but the sheath, the medial ring, the flared head, mottled brown and pink tones, and otherwise tubular shape make its origin unmistakable.<br />
<br />
Kyle wipes the saliva, phlegm, and Kyle&#39;s not sure he wants to imagine what else off of himself. He felt some in his mouth. It&#39;s too late to prevent infection. At least Kyle&#39;s cock will hopefully grow as big as Jennifer&#39;s cock has grown. He&#39;s so caught up in his fate with the flu that he&#39;s forgotten that more of his fate is hanging in the balance. He just stares at Jennifer blankly. Kyle does that every time he tries to talk to a girl; but this is a hundred times worse.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighs and finally says, &quot;Too late. Both. Turnabout&#39;s fair play.&quot; She snickers, and notices the tiny tent in his pants. &quot;Aww, is this a fear-boner? Or did you forget you had a stack of dimes from the bank. It suits you. For your transformation, your cock will never get any larger, no matter what this &#39;flu&#39; does to you. And you will never get any bigger. You&#39;ll always be scrawny, 5&#39;3, and with that four-incher. You&#39;ll be the school&#39;s ponygirl. For your dare, in three weeks, after this flu has had time to run its course, you will announce yourself to the whole school as the only horse girl with a small penis.&quot; Jennifer sneezes again, and her growing cock slaps into Kyle&#39;s face, growing past twelve inches, with testicles the size of her fist. &quot;Now strip your pants. As hard as this boner is, my pussy is craving harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is she unconcerned about the risk of pregnancy? Or is she oblivious? Maybe Jennifer desires it, being so estrus-driven? Kyle realizes after Jennifer impatiently slaps him on the face with the cock that he doesn&#39;t have time to debate it. He pushes back against her, but can&#39;t put any fight into it. Jennifer smells wayyy too good, and Kyle&#39;s cock is beginning to burn with need... and she&#39;s literally offering herself to him! Although &#39;offering&#39; is probably the wrong term. Kyle is way to horny, despite (or, perhaps because of?) his fear, to resist. He unbuckles his cargo pants, and pulls them down, earning a tease from a nearby jock about his &#39;tighty-whities.&#39; Kyle pulls the offending, white underwear down next, leaving his bare, human cock rising above Kyle&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
Jennifer grins at the small cock, but still mounts it, in front of everyone, like it&#39;s the most natural thing in the world. Everyone just seems to be enjoying the show, like it&#39;s something perfectly acceptable to just gawk at. Sex on the bus. Totally something to see, but not terribly unusual. Not that Jennifer&#39;s higher functions are really controlling her actions. She mounts Kyle, pressing her wet, breed-driven cunt over his cock. Jennifer and Kyle moan softly as both break their proverbial cherries together, and Kyle moans at the sensation of his cock buried in the warmth of Jennifer&#39;s cunt. For her part, Jennifer&#39;s never had any cock in her; so even a small cock is an intense experience, so she can&#39;t help but moan out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Even having sex among her peers, Jennifer needs some composure, and so quickly recovers, and reasserts herself with a bounce that leaves Kyle crying out. Neither Kyle&#39;s cry, nor his thoughts are certain whether that was more pleasurable or painful. Jennifer begins riding Kyle, slowly, and steadily. She even berates him, &quot;God, Kyle, your prick is so small, I can barely move if I don&#39;t want it falling out.&quot; Kyle gapes at her, unsure if he should be offended, embarrassed, or what; but most of what he feels is aroused. Jennifer&#39;s cunt has grown longer, and stretchier, like a mare&#39;s. Even Kyle has to admit it&#39;s a bit like a hot dog in a hallway. Not that this discourages Jennifer, beyond berating him.<br />
<br />
Kyle spurts quickly, falling back, and relaxing as he goes limp inside of her. Jennifer stares daggers at Kyle, for coming while she&#39;s barely gotten warmed up. &quot;Noted. I won&#39;t be riding the ponyboi, or girl, whichever you are, in the future.&quot; Kyle sits there, morbidly flushed as the whole bus watched him prematurely cum inside of Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Still heavily aroused, Jennifer finds a jock, the coveted Billy Mason to begin flirting with, &quot;Heyy, hot stuff~ Think you can hold your load long enough to put out my fiiire...&quot; Billy, oblivious to the flu, but very aroused by both Jennifer&#39;s nineteen-inch cock&#39;s musk, and Jennifer&#39;s burning, soaked sex, is helpless to resist, and begins stripping for her, letting his larger, 7-inch erection rise into the air, which Jennifer quickly mounts, and begins riding.<br />
<br />
Kyle, shrunken down to a ball of humiliation, and Jennifer&#39;s pre-cum, can do little but watch Jennifer&#39;s skirt and tail-clad ass. Jennifer&#39;s cheerleader top shrinks as the horse-girl gets taller and more muscular. She rolls up and down in Billy&#39;s lap, mumuring comments about how big Billy&#39;s cock is going to become, as her cock flops around in Billy&#39;s face. Billy shamelessly wraps both lips around Jennifer&#39;s cock, letting the flare stretch into his mouth for a moment, before he begins suckling on it. Somehow, the jock that once berated Kyle by calling him a wide variety of gay slurs, is now happily sucking Jennifer&#39;s massive horse cock, swallowing what pre-cum she spills. What even is a gag reflex?<br />
<br />
Other students begin gathering around, male, female, and all of the above. All are fascinated by Jennifer&#39;s horsecock. While Jennifer rolls her hips over Billy&#39;s cock, she gets to coo in delight as three sets of hands, and three tongues all begin worshipping the cock. With so much adoration, Jennifer cums quickly. Jennifer&#39;s head falls back; and she screams in pleasure as her balls clench, and veins on her otherwise-smooth cock bulge and throb. Billy&#39;s cheeks swell from the volume. He has to pull back as his ability to swallow is overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
Thick ropes of pearlescent white cum begins spraying across the numerous bus passengers. Like an out-of-control fountain, Jennifer&#39;s cock spasms wildly, spreading her seed liberally, not leaving a single student, nor the bus driver untouched. From the way Billy&#39;s whole body tightens up, and relaxes a few seconds into after he pulls away, it&#39;s apparent he releases his seed inside of Jennifer&#39;s needy sex,<br />
<br />
A few moments later, after Jennifer and Billy have had time to recover from their very public tryst, the bus arrives at the school. All the students gather their things and exit. All the students, that is, except for Kyle, whom is equal parts mortified, and aroused by the events of the bus ride. He hides in his seat, and waits until everyone else has left. A few seconds later, he finally zips up his cargo pants, and begins to timidly exit the bus.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, now Kyle is beginning to feel the haze of the flu running through his system. Combined with the bright glare of the sun in his eyes, and the flu he created wreaking havoc inside of him, the urge to sneeze quickly grows overwhelming.</p>
