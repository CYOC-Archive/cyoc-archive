<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With three very horny bara guys fucking themselves in an intense orgy, Loki thought it was time to get another one. He took the TV remote and looked for someone interesting. It was pretty fast, because he found a blonde guy in a cartoon about secret agents. The boy was quietly laying on his bed, so Loki thought it was a good chance to make use of his magic.<br />
<br />
Ron had a bad day at school, with his family and even in his secret life. He was so tired of the world that he just wanted to stay in his room all day. However, destiny had different plans and small magic particles started to hover around without him noticing it.<br />
<br />
He guessed he needed someone in his life, and although he thought of love at first, in fact he was feeling something completely different. He hadn&#39;t realized that his dick was twitching at the idea of another person, and he had started to toy with it unconsciously. That was really strange. He didn&#39;t use to do that, and when he noticed he wondered about it. He adjusted himself and put a hand up to his face, where he felt something unusual, a rough sandpaper-like layer of scruff.<br />
<br />
“What the-!?”, Ron jumped off his bed and ran over to his mirror. The face looking back was his, albeit covered in a massively thick dark blonde 5 o’clock shadow that rose high up on his cheekbones.<br />
<br />
He touched the foreign hair and immediately noticed his forearms were covered in equally thick dark blonde hair. Also, his arms looked meatier, like someone who lifted weights or so. Like Brick and those meatheads in the football team. His dick perked up a bit more at the thought of looking like them and he was scared of those weird, uncontrolled thoughts coming out of his own brain. He stepped back, and got the first good look at his morphing body.<br />
<br />
Ron had filled out his shirt, almost to bursting. His arms filled the sleeves, as he saw two massive pecs pressing against the black fabric, the shirt pulled so tight he could make out hair was actually growing through the stretched fabric while he watched. His chest hung so heavy, the bottom part of the swoop was lost to the overhang of his new muscle tits. Although he can&#39;t believe it, his jaw looked now more square and masculine under the developing beard, dropped as he noticed long dark blonde hairs creeping over the collar of his increasingly comically small shirt. He felt the tension of the fabric on his growing delts and lats as the sleeves started cutting into his massive arms.<br />
<br />
Panicking, Ron pulled at the waist of the shirt, in a futile effort to pull it off his widening torso, as he raised the hem, he saw a furry six-pack pushing out of his formerly thin teen belly. It looked like one of those bodybuilders he’d seen in magazines, except where their abs were smooth, the crevasses between the bricks of his core were accentuated by thick, soft hair. The shirt caught and stuck on his widening lats, and he could hear the seams under his arms ripping. In a last ditch effort, he used his newfound strength to rip the shirt off, his fur-covered, massive muscles erupting through the tattered fabric. <br />
<br />
Ron heaved a breath, feeling his racing heart through his thick chest. Looking back in the mirror, he could finally take stock of what he was transforming into. He couldn’t believe what was happening to him. He was looking less like a teen and more like a bearish muscleman ready to fuck! That fleeting thought invaded his consciousness and he internally screamed in panic. His pecs were already juicy with thick muscle. His pelt had spread, covering both massive pecs to his growing and widening shoulders. As a meaty paw stroked the hair-covered bowling balls of shoulders, down to ham-sized, equally furry arms, Ron was completely paralyzed with fear. “Fucking horny” the continuous thought raced through his fuzzy, thickening mind, reflecting his fuzzy, thickening body, and as his gaze and attention were refocused, he noticed an equally fuzzy, thickening cock, free from its fabric cage, engorging itself as he took in his changes.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me?!!” He cried out in a way more deeper voice than he remembered, now tinged with a slowness that only comes through an excessive production of testosterone. <br />
<br />
Ron looked down, his bushing beard bristling against the plentiful forest of his darkening, ballooning pecs. He cupped his left pec with his right hand and was surprised to feel his bicep crammed against his right pec. He could feel the thick hair brush against the corded muscle of his developing arm as the follicles on chest continued to lengthen, a certain part of his mind equally tickled and excited about the metamorphosis. He moved his hand through the fur on his growing left pec over to his right as a pelt instantly spread down his torso straight to his cock, leaving his furred six pack-turned-slight muscle gut under two thick, heavy, pillows of a hairy, muscled chest in its wake. <br />
<br />
The last thing that Ron processed through his thickening brain was that his lower body had been equally furred and muscled, shredding his athletic shorts and boxers, exposing a now cut 11 inch monster that the bear known as Ron looked quizzically at before it erupted in a massive stream of cum, knocking the muscle bear unconscious on his bed the enough time for Loki to take him out to his bara harem.</p>
