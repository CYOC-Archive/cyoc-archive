<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Gaz appeared from his vessel and watched over the two sleeping hunks before him. Usually, this was where he would have set in the stronger reality bending magic to help the wishes settle in easier, but he felt there was something special about these two. <br />
<br />
Gaz operated in a fairly routine way upon being discovered, one catering to his own personal interests. Being a gay man prior to his imprisonment, he still maintained those urges, if not to a stronger degree. Whether is was the isolation or the power of the magic flowing through him, he knew what he wanted: attractive men. And regardless of his master&#39;s intention or predisposition, Gaz would find a way to turn whoever stumbled across him into his own personal, gay fantasy. Most of the time, he would grant the wishes of his master and once transformed to his liking, move on. He was lucky if he snagged any extras along the way. And the whole thing about being bound to them for a month? Just a ploy to get the wishers to be more reckless. He was only bound by their dissatisfaction. Afterwards, he was free to go. <br />
<br />
As Ryan and Carter sleep there tangled in each other&#39;s arms, Gaz knew they were satisfied with the life they now had. But it was almost as if there was an intangible thread tethering him to them. So, he would stay, for the moment, to see what else their heart&#39;s desires could create--and be twisted into. <br />
<br />
------- <br />
<br />
Ryan woke up feeling a weight on his chest. As he looked down, he was taken back by the sight of a large, burly man resting his head on his pec. It was a bit fuzzy at the moment, but Ryan could piece together that this man was Carter, his apparent husband. Ryan furrowed his brows as he tried to concentrate on two competing realities. In one, he could remember himself and Carter, two friends in college, two straight friends in college. But now he&#39;s also faced with this reality before him, the one where he&#39;s in a gay relationship with Carter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Gaz. You there? We need to talk,&quot; Ryan said in a loud whisper. <br />
<br />
Gaz popped into view. &quot;Yeah! What do you need?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on here? I don&#39;t remember wishing for any of this. Aren&#39;t you supposed to do what I say?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I&#39;m not a mind reader. When you make a reality altering change with just a one sentence wish, I&#39;m going to have to take some extra liberties to fill in the gaps.&quot; Gaz said, feigning ignorance. <br />
<br />
&quot;But all of this started because I wished to have more muscles. How does that escalate into me fucking my best friend Carter? Who is now my husband, I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, perhaps this is a lesson to not let your emotions control your wishes, especially when there&#39;s someone around to grant them. Besides, are you not satisfied with your new life?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ryan looked around at the luxurious apartment he was in, his sexy husband, and his own stunning body. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. I&#39;m not sure if I would&#39;ve achieved anything like this in my old life. And if being an older gay guy is the only trade off for all this, then I can&#39;t complain.&quot; <br />
<br />
During their conversation, Ryan didn&#39;t realize he was no longer whispering. It was only when Carter began to stir that he took notice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, who are you talking to?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Ryan trailer off. <br />
<br />
Gaz then made his appearance visible to Carter. &quot;It&#39;s fine, Ryan. He&#39;s your husband after all, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Carter jumped. &quot;Oh my God! What, er, who the hell is that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Carter, this is Gaz. He&#39;s a genie I came across yesterday. I would have told you about him sooner, but I never really got the chance,&quot; Ryan said in a half truth. &quot;He&#39;s the reason we have this nice apartment.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you worked really hard to get the money for this. I remember those nights you stayed in late at the office. All those conferences you went to...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I also alter reality so that others accept the changes without question. Their minds sort of fill in the gaps for them,&quot; Gaz interjected. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what else did you wish for?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know, a few minor cosmetic changes here and there. A long, healthy marriage with you,&quot; Ryan said. He went in for a kiss to distract Carter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, how sweet. But what now? Shouldn&#39;t he be going soon? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten your three wishes in by now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a bit different than those genies in the movies, hun. Gaz will be with us for the next month.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants to grant three wishes, then disappear for a few decades or more anyways? I need time to get out and stretch these magical legs of mine,&quot; Gaz said, laughing as he stretched his legs out like one of those old toys. <br />
<br />
While the three of them continued their conversation, there was a commotion coming from down on the street. Carter was the first to notice, and he promptly got out of bed to see what was happening. <br />
<br />
There was a man who appeared to have a lady pressed up against the wall. The streets at this time of day were fairly empty, so no one was around to immediately help as she started screaming at him. &quot;Do you guys see this? That man is going to hurt her! I wish we could do something, but we&#39;re so high up,&quot; Carter yelled back. <br />
<br />
Gaz and Ryan gave each other knowing looks. &quot;Gaz, I wish the lady had the help she needed.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as Ryan made the wish, the changes immediately began to take place. Being that the three of them were on the penthouse floor, they couldn&#39;t see much of the details of what was about to happen. <br />
<br />
As the woman was held up against the wall, she continued struggling. &quot;Get off of me you prick! Someone help!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No one&#39;s gonna be able to help you in time, little lady. Now just give me what I want.&quot; <br />
<br />
He started moving his hand toward the hem of her dress before stopping. The woman&#39;s pushing suddenly started to feel like it was actually moving him backwards. He looked back up to her finding that she hadn&#39;t gotten away from the wall, but had somehow grown larger. <br />
<br />
The woman in her fight against the criminal started to feel a strange warmth washing over her. She wasn&#39;t able to get a good look at herself in this moment, but she noticed that she was now staring at eye level with the man. Before long, she was staring down at her assaulter. <br />
<br />
The man back away as this happened. &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rapidly, the woman&#39;s frame began to fill out with muscles as her curves began to simultaneously diminish. Her waist was first, as it pulled inward, along with her rather full ass which had begun flattening. Although, it would not stay flat for long as it instead began filling out with tight muscle. A similar story took place with her torso when her breasts receded into her chest, leaving her with a large pair of plump pecs. Underneath her clothes, her stomach hardened as a set of abs settled onto her. The woman watched as her chest transformed and awkwardly filled out her now much too tight dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, my tits are gone! What did you do to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me! I didn&#39;t do this.&quot; <br />
<br />
As she was feeling her body, the rest of the changes escalated faster. Her arms and legs quickly inflated with size, growing large with massive biceps and thick quads. Her face started shifting into a more masculine shape as her brows thickened and her jaw sharpened. As the transformation increased in pace, her pleasure grew accordingly. With her newly grown Adam&#39;s apple, she began moaning in a deep, baritone voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck... I feel so strong. I&#39;m getting huge as- Wait, is that me talking? Shit, why am I getting so itchy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her body began looking slightly darker as small hairs worked their way out of her skin and across her body. In almost a wave starting from her feet. Thick, course hairs sprouted up her legs, leading up to her ass. Soon, a dense carpet of hair poked out from the top of her dress. As the hair traveled down her arms. Her jaw was also getting its own layer of hair as stubble grew across her face. Her haircut pulled itself in as it shortened into a crew cut. <br />
<br />
The woman felt the hairs push out of her chest and ran her larger hands through them. &#39;What the hell is happening to me?&#39; she thought before feeling an odd sensation. &#39;Please don&#39;t tell me...&#39; <br />
<br />
While her long hair pulled in the top of her head, something else was pushing out down below. The woman&#39;s, soon now to be man&#39;s, vagina closed up and descended as the rest of their reproductive organs rearranged themselves internally. Eventually, her fledgling sack was filled with two large testicles, which would soon be paired with the expanding clitoris that would become his new, long dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit! I&#39;m a man!&quot; He could feel himself getting slightly hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, gross,&quot; the assaulter said. <br />
<br />
The dress, which was being stretched to it&#39;s limits, shifted and split into two as the top half became a tank top and the lower half turned into a pair of jogging shorts. <br />
<br />
Settled into his new changes, the new man looked across at the confused man who had just tried assaulting this former woman. The memories of her walking to work and being sexually assaulted by a man were replaced as other memories took root of him going out a morning jog before being jumped by a man at knifepoint. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not a smart idea to pick on someone bigger than you,&quot; the new man said before grabbing the assaulter and throwing him against the wall, giving him a few swift kicks to the stomach before jogging off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank God. Some jogger came along and took care of the guy. But I can&#39;t tell where the woman went,&quot; Carter said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s doing better for herself now.&quot; Gaz smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;That gives me an idea though,&quot; Carter said. &quot;We pretty much have all we need in our lives. So, why do we go around trying to help others?&quot; <br />
<br />
Bingo. There it was. The thread tying Gaz to these two. <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a great idea, Carter. You&#39;re always thinking of other,&quot; Ryan said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be more than willing to help. I love making dreams come true.&quot; &#39;Especially mine,&#39; Gaz thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that just about settles our plans for today!&quot; <br />
<br />
As the three set on their day, excited to make a change in the life of strangers, they first come across...</p>
