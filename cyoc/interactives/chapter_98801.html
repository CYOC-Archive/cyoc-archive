<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary didn&#39;t make Brittany lick her feet because of some fetish.  She really just wanted to humiliate her.  But as she felt the small long wet tongue caress the ridges of her feet, she had to admit it was very arousing.  <br />
<br />
I need to try this again sometime, thought Mary, as she enjoyed her cleaning.  After a terribly short time for Mary and a terribly long time for Brittany, Mary raised her foot away from Brittany and looked down at her.  &quot;Well, Brittany?  Are they clean enough to enter your precious house?  Don&#39;t lie to me.  I wouldn&#39;t want these ugly boots to bring anything filthy into your house.&quot; She wiggled her toes just above Brittany&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Brittany wiped her tongue on her hands, trying to get rid herself of the awful taste,  and looked sadly at Mary.  &quot;Yes, they are clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.  Now we can go to the kitchen and get something to eat, &quot; said Mary eagerly, as she walked further into the house towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat? &quot; said Brittany sharply.  &quot;We need to leave.  We have to get to the store as soon as possible.  It might be closing any minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary turned around and gave Brittany a stern look.  &quot;I&#39;m very hungry, Brittany.  And I don&#39;t think you want to trapped with me in a car during a long trip when I&#39;m very hungry.  Now, come here and help me get some food. Don&#39;t make me come get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany shuddered, and slowly led Mary into their large kitchen.  &quot;Well, here it is, &quot; she said, pointing towards the large industrial size fridge. &quot;Bon appetite&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feed me, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? &quot; asked Brittany, with a hint of fear of voice.<br />
<br />
Mary sat on a large metal bar stool near an island in the kitchen, and leaned her elbows on the counter. It groaned and bent under her massive weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, Feed me.  Find me some food, and bring it to me, &quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you  want to eat?  &quot; asked Brittany, with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, you fool, &quot; said Mary, as her large tongue snaked out of her mouth and ran along her sharp teeth,  &quot;Meat, &quot; she said, practically drooling the words.<br />
<br />
Brittany shuddered again, and quickly opened the industrial size fridge.  Inside was a large pig that that the staff was preparing for another party her parents were going to have this weekend.  It had been basting for several days, but had yet to be cooked.  &quot;All we have is some kind of pig my parents wanted to roast, but it hasn&#39;t been cooked.  I don&#39;t think you would like it.&quot; She didn&#39;t hear a response, so she closed the door and turned to look a Mary. She was frightened to see that Mary was salivating profusely, with an almost savage look in her eyes.  Mary ran her tongue along her lips and growled, &quot;BRING IT TO ME.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany quickly reopened the door, and hid from the hideous view of her monstrous friend. She looked at the pig.  It was massive, almost as big as her tiny body.  She doubted she could move it, much less carry it.  Still, hiding behind the door, she said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can.  It&#39;s too big.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just bring it to me! &quot; growled Mary, with some urgency.<br />
<br />
Brittany used all her strength to pull the pig to the edge of the refrigerator shelf, but as soon as it was free, the weight proved too much for her to handle, and she dropped it.  The dish clattered on the floor, and sent the pig sliding across it. Brittany awaited her punishment, but was surprised when Mary jumped past her with impressive speed for such a large creature, and began to devour the animal.  She heard sickening crunches as Mary&#39;s powerful jaw tore the carcass apart, snapping through the bones easily.  She then swallowed large portions of meat whole.<br />
<br />
Mary turned and saw Brittany eyeing her with disgust.  She looked down at herself, and saw blood and meat dripping down her chest.  Mary was actually a little disgusted and scared herself.  She was beginning to like her new body and had enjoyed playing the tough guy act, scaring Brittany.  But her reaction to the food was no act.  She craved the meat, and when she saw it on the floor she simply lost control.  Her behavior was concerning, and it was the first time since her change when she began to have serious fears about how much the transformation had really affected her.  And what it would be like if she couldn&#39;t return to her previous self. She was about to voice her concerns to Brittany, and agree to her demands to return to the shop when she saw the look of disgust on her face.  She had seen it often, frequently after Brittany had been particularly cruel to her after embarrassing or humiliating her, and it brought back her rage with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, not hungry? &quot; said Mary with a sneer, as she wiped the gore off her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, &quot; said Brittany dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t lie.  I know you are.  You just don&#39;t like meat.  We just need to find the right food, &quot; said Mary.  She grabbed a small apple, which had previously been lodged in the pig&#39;s mouth, and tossed it to her. &quot;Here, this is more like something a rat like you would eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really not hungry, &quot; said Brittany, as she tried to hand the apple back to Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, &quot; said Mary angrily, as she sat back on the metal stool by the counter.   The metal groaned, and dipped even lower.  &quot;You got to ogle me while I ate.  Now I wanna watch you eat. Now eat! &quot; said Mary as she glared at Brittany.  Brittany tried to chew the apple, but her new muzzle was too long and made it difficult.  She eventually realized that she needed to nibble around it, like a small mouse.  Under Mary&#39;s watchful gaze, Brittany began to eat the apple.  After a while, she really got into it, and began the nibble around the apple at ferocious speed, turning it quickly in her small hands to find another surface to chew.  The apple tasted good, and her current problems seemed to drift away as she focused on nothing but the delicious food.  Loud cruel laughter brought her back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, that is so cute.  You look just like a rat, gnawing on its food, &quot; Mary laughed.  <br />
<br />
Brittany flushed red with embarrassment, and tossed the remains of the apple in the trash. &quot;I&#39;m finished, and ready to leave.  Can we go now?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Mary stood and stretched, brushing the claws of her fingers across roof.  &quot;Yeah, I think it&#39;s about time we hit the road.&quot;</p>
