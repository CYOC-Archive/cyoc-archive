<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>With her daughter now successfully transformed to look like her, Elle decided she had the perfect 
opportunity to make a few changes to her old body. And it wouldn't hurt to make Alli's stay in her life a 
little more bearable, even if she wouldn't remember any of it by the end. And the best part was, when they 
switched back, Elle would inherit all of the improvements she made. Her mind made up, Elle quickly sat down 
and began typing to bring her ideas to life. Unfortunately, doing so proved far more difficult than she had 
imagined. Elle quickly found that translating the pictures in her head to MasterPC commands frustratingly 
difficult. To start with, she had typed:
<br />
<p>>>Elle's breasts will increase to the size she desires
<br />
<p>with the expectation that Alli in Elle's body would be altered accordingly, but instead she was caught by 
surprise when her nipples began to tingle. Her nipples hardened and she began feeling a pleasurable sensation, 
like goosebumps but different, all across her chest. Elle looked down as she felt pressure in the flesh behind 
her breasts, and was rewarded with the sight of her already ample bosom swelling outward. As her breasts grew, 
they lost none of the youthful firmness that Elle was enjoying so much. The fabric of her shirt strained to 
contain the growing mounds, and her bra began digging into her back painfully. Just as they reached a large D-
cup, Elle decided they were just about big enough. No sooner had the thought entered her mind then the growth 
halted abruptly. To her pleased surprise, her clothing adjusted itself to fit without prompting.
<br />
<p>Still, enjoyable as that had been, it was not the result she'd been aiming for. The MasterPC apparently 
still knew that the person in Alli's body was Elle and vice versa. That was good to know. Deciding to take 
another crack at it, she returned to the MasterPC and this time she copied and pasted her old command and 
changed the name at the front.
<br />
<p>>>Alli's breasts will increase to the size she desires
<br />
Hitting enter again, this time she saw Alli's breasts begin expanding. Elle watched as they grew to a large D, 
expecting them to stop there, but instead they kept right on growing. When they reached E-cup Elle guess that 
something was wrong and began looking through her command to see what her mistake had been. She found it 
quickly enough. When she had copied her old command she had neglected to take into account that Alli was still 
in a trance, and therefore couldn't do anything to stop the growth herself. And so they kept on expanding, 
straining against her shirt and threatening to tear free. By the time Elle had figured out her mistake they 
had reached F-cup and were on their way to G. Elle quickly typed in
<br />
<p>>>Alli's breasts will stop expanding immediately and return to their original size
<br />
<p>and hit enter. Immediately the growing masses receded into her daughter's chest, leaving Elle back where 
she started, except for her mounting frustration. Elle was getting fed up with the difficulty she was 
encountering. although she had to admit her own chest was much improved. And it had been a little funny to 
watch her old body grow those enormous boobs. As she laughed an errant thought about wanting to know what it 
would be like to have such ridiculously huge boobs entered her mind, and Elle was alarmed to feel the tingling 
and pressure in her chest return. She looked down and saw her chest exploding outward, making fast progress 
toward matching Alli for size. Elle began to be pulled downward by the growing weight, while her clothes were 
fighting a losing battle of containment. The growth quickly overcame her bra, overflowing the cups, and Elle 
began hearing ominous stretching sounds from her shirt. She tried to stop them, but her breasts seemed fixated 
on that one stray thought, and didn't stop until they'd achieved at least G-cup in size. 
<br />
<p>Elle, no longer amused, tried to return her breasts to their previous size by concentrating hard on that 
thought, but to no avail. Trying to determine the cause of her difficulty, the thought occurred to her that in 
her command she had specified a size increase only, and thus she was stuck unless she wanted to go larger. Not 
only that, she had never specified a time limit to her command, which explained why it was still in effect. 
Deciding to test her theory, she thought again about decreasing her bust size with no effect. Then she thought 
about going slightly larger, and with a short tingle and a small surge her chest swelled out an inch further. 
Now exasperated, Elle turned back to the MasterPC with difficulty and typed
<br />
<p>>>Elle's breasts will return to their original size, and both Alli's and Elle's breasts will stop growing 
in response to the previously entered commands
<br />
<p>With relief, Elle felt her chest contract until it was back to its normal size. No no better off than when 
she started, Elle decided that she was better off not trying to use the MasterPC for this kind of thing. 
Either because of her inexperience or just the nature of the program, she was having no luck with it, and she 
looked around for an alternative...</p>
