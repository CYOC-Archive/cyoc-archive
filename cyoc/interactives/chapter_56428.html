<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex looked at Ty, his eyes bright and smiling. “Ty, I can't believe it. This is too good to be true!” His hands moved between his body, which had the beginnings of a hairy beefy chest, to his goatee, which though wispy and sparse, promised of greater things. “This is awesome” he sighs, as he rubs his hairy nipples.<br />
<br />
Ty looks at his friend and asks, “I'm glad you like it, but what about tomorrow's swim meet?” <br />
<br />
Alex turned, his face pale. “I forgot. I can't look like this there! Hell, I can't go home like this!!” His newly rounded face flushed again, and his eyes teared up. “It's not fair. I would quit that team if I could keep looking like this” He says, his voice cracking and tight.<br />
<br />
Ty consoles his friend, rubbing his back. “It'll be all right.” Ty says soothingly. “I'll fix it all, just you go home, and go to sleep. Tomorrow it'll feel like a brand new world.” He patted Alex's back, and Alex turned his chubby goateed face toward Ty.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Alex asks, uncertain.<br />
<br />
“Really. Your parents won't say anything, and the swim meet will be a thing of the past.” Ty replied, and in his mind, he thought out what was needed. <br />
<br />
“Well, all right” Alex answers and gathers his things. He puts on a gym shirt that now stretches over his chest. He grins as he feels the taut shirt around his chest and loose over his abdominals. With great effort and a little assistance from Ty, Alex was able to pull up his boxers along with his shorts. The tight fitting clothing created a sizable bulge in front. “Guess I won't need to work out, eh?” Alex laughs.<br />
<br />
“Only if you want, personally I think you should build bigger muscles!” Ty replies his grin spread widely.<br />
 <br />
Alex blushes and nods. “Cool, then I'll keep using the bench at home.” He picks his bag and heads to the door of Ty's room. “I'll see you in school, Ty” He waves and heads home.<br />
<br />
Ty smiles, as his augmented friend bikes down the street. 'I'll definitely be seeing more of you' Ty thinks. 'I wish that Alex would continue to get a little stronger, a little bigger and a little taller each day. And I wish that every time he saw a muscle guy he fancies doing something, that he would be tempted and would, eventually, try it.' Ty sighs. He feels the tingle of a wish completed, and he heads to his room, looking for some clothes to wear. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alex rides home. He's so excited that he doesn't feel the small buzz as Ty's wish comes true. He feels the taut shirt rustle around his body a little closer than before. He slows down as he turns into his house. Across the hedge next to his driveway, his neighbor, Mr. Tonsor, calls out. <br />
<br />
“Hey Alex, Have a good ride?” He says, over the waist high hedge.<br />
<br />
“Sure did, Mr. Tonsor.” Alex replies. He feels a blush coming. <br />
<br />
Mr. Tonsor was a huge muscle builder. He competed in last month's State bodybuilding contest and won 2nd place. Alex sees him reach down behind the hedge. <br />
<br />
“That's good. Would you do something for me?” The bare chested Mr. Tonsor asks. <br />
<br />
He stands a good 8 inches taller than Alex and outweighs him by almost 90lbs. He has a nice thick beard, one Alex has always admired. Mr. Tonsor removes a thick 9 inch cigar from his mouth, exhaling a thin stream of blue smoke. Though he tries to blow it away from Alex, the wind changes and blows it into Alex's face.<br />
<br />
 “Oh, I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't' mean to do that” <br />
<br />
Alex, trying to hide a raging hard-on, smiles “Not a problem, Mr. Tonsor. What did you need me to do?” he replies. As the smoke continues to drift to him, Alex inhales some of it. It has a sharp pungent smell, and Alex was suppressing the urge to cough. <br />
<br />
Mr. Tonsor smiles and puts the cigar back in his mouth. “Good, I need you to give this to your parents.” He says, as he hands Alex an envelope. “It's my contribution to the charity event next month. The guys at the gym and I raised a good bit to help those people, so if you'd be a good man and give it to them, I'd really appreciate it.” <br />
<br />
Mr. Tonsor extends a hand holding a plain white envelope over the hedge. The envelope stuck to his hands a bit as he handed it over. “Sorry about I was … um a … eating some honey. Yeah that’s it honey.  Any way could you give this to your mother?” <br />
<br />
The envelope is thick, and as Alex peaks inside, he sees hundreds of hundred dollar bills. “Wow, Okay, Mr. Tonsor, won't be a problem” He say, tucking the envelope in his tight front pocket. <br />
<br />
Mr. Tonsor smiles back, “Knew you were a good looking man but in that tight outfit does not do you justice. Oh, by the way, your goatee's coming in great!” He turns and walks back across the hedge, leaving Alex in a cloud of blue smoke. <br />
<br />
Alex trembles, exhaling the smoke with a passion, and he turns and heads back to the house. Midway there, he adjusts himself so his rock hard dick is a little more comfy. Inside, he sets the envelope down on the counter. He writes a note, telling his mom that it's from Mr. Tonsor. He sets it aside and runs up to his room. There, he looks at himself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
“Oh, this is the best.” Alex thinks as he re-examines his hefty body. <br />
<br />
He goes over to the scale, and it pops up 216. His boner pops up, and Alex disappears in the bathroom. He comes back a bit sweaty, but smiling.<br />
<br />
Alex promised Ty that he would go straight to bed. He un-dressed and decided not to put on his PJ's, instead opting for just his tight boxers. “Alex, you're looking quite the hot man.” He thinks, looking into his bedroom mirror. A warm breeze flows across him. Alex goes to the open window. <br />
<br />
The twilight sky had gone to violet. Alex looks down from his opened window and spots his neighbor sitting in his backyard. Mr. Tonsor was dressed in skimpy but packed poser. Alex felt a familiar tingle in his boxers once again. A whiff of the cigar smoke floated into the window causing Alex to lets out a cough. Mr. Tonsor stirs in his chair and turns to look in the direction of the cough. Alex quickly closes his window and leans against it. <br />
<br />
Below in the backyard Mr. Tonsor, with a grin from ear to ear, sticks the cigar back in his mouth and says. “Almost ready.”<br />
 <br />
Having been almost caught, Alex hopped in his bed, and with the first touch of his head to the pillow, he was out like a light. Only the breeze and the smell of cigar remained stirring in the room. <br />
<br />
Back at Ty's room, in his mind’s eye Ty watched his friend and chuckled. This was promising to be a most interesting adventure.</p>
