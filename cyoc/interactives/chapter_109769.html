<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana had had the best sex of their lives the night that Juliana proposed. The two had just naturally fallen for each other(Or not so naturally, considering The Great Change, but why question love?). Their epic, multi-hour lovemaking was so hot and electric that it could have ignited the stars themselves, and while the former Jose could have argued that as a man he could compare this glorious night to one of many trysts with various girlfriends and one night stands, this had been the former Milton&#39;s first time. Yes, he had really been a forty-year old virgin, and his first time was unarguably the greatest moment of his life thus far. After they both passed out, exhausted, the world spun around them, the universe not even noticing the revolution.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Millie had been the first person to awaken. She stretched her arms longingly into the air to get all the achy pains out, put on her nerd glasses and a bathrobe, and went outside to gaze upon the natural beauty permeating this new world. She saw butterflies make their circuitous motions, and she watched a colony of ants pass her by. She wasn&#39;t even bothered or scared by insects anymore. Everything finally felt right.<br />
<br />
The only worry she had was whether she should keep her last name of Aaronsohn, take on the Quesada mantle, or make it a hyphenated deal. She also needed to start searching out her estranged family to invite them to the upcoming wedding. She didn&#39;t have a lot of relatives, not like Juliana who had a huge family, but her mom and dad should be there on her special day at the very least.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the already married couple of Elizabeth and Robbie were struggling with their relationship.<br />
<br />
“So how was this religious meeting? They didn&#39;t try and pressure you into buying a subscription to The Watchtower, did they?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, dear, and no, they didn&#39;t. They were actually very nice” said Elizabeth, drinking her morning coffee. She sat across from Robbie who had just gotten out of the shower, wearing a towel over her head to dry her now luscious hair, and had a second towel wrapped around her chest. She was reading the newspaper, trying her best not to make direct eye contact.<br />
<br />
“So they were all in their old bodies?”<br />
<br />
“The born women were. I have to be honest, it made me feel more comfortable.”<br />
<br />
“To be around people “your own age”?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, more or less. Don&#39;t tell me that it&#39;s not weird or problematic that eighty year old men and nineteen year old girls now look exactly the same, and you can&#39;t tell which is which.”<br />
<br />
“Not me” said Robbie, still not looking at her wife, as she was more focused on Syria and how the reconstruction of that country was being planned now that their long, horrific civil war was finally over and all the bad guys were being tried for war crimes. The United States was spearheading the relief effort, which was typically being criticized by half the Congress and one of the major presidential candidates.<br />
<br />
“Honey...if that&#39;s a veiled way of saying that you don&#39;t think I find you attractive, I do” pleaded Elizabeth. “I really love you and want to make this work.”<br />
<br />
Robbie put the paper down. “So do I. But please, stop with al the slut shaming. I like being eye candy like this. I like being sexualized. There&#39;s no more male gaze to be had, but maybe if you acted like you wanted me, I wouldn&#39;t be out drinking like a fish every night or crying myself to sleep.”<br />
<br />
Elizabeth once again thought back to that woman Greta&#39;s words about making Robbie feel wanted. Offhandedly, Elizabeth wondered if she and Jean were the two in the now infamous “vanishing car” news story, which had gone viral online and even had a segment on CNN. One of the threads on Reddit about it had over twenty-thousand posts. She stared at a picture of Elizabeth and Robert and Billy when they were both males hanging on the wall, and sighed. She really wanted things to return to the way they were. Then she saw Billie walk into the kitchen in her little blue pajamas. <br />
<br />
“Mommy and Mom, please get along again” pleaded Billie. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Dumbass White Bitch, she even thought of herself with that humiliating moniker now instead of Dana, opened the door upon hearing the doorbell ring very early in the morning and saw her fellow sub Mandy Bosman in a cute outfit. <br />
<br />
“Shh” whispered Mandy, smiling. “The mistress wanted to me to meet you personally to let her slave know that she has a big day planned out for you. After the ritual paddling of your apple bottom ass, she wants to move up into role playing, where she&#39;s the kidnapper and your her kidnapping victim. She&#39;s going to be tying you to a chair, slapping you around for a bit, taping your mouth shut to hear your pitiful moans for help, the works!”<br />
<br />
DWB rolled her eyes back and groaned orgasmically. “Tell me more sweet nothings!”<br />
<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
You know that feeling when you&#39;re watching a movie or a TV show, and everyone just looks way too pretty to actually be a beat cop or a detective or a domestic violence victim? Because the average, everyday person just isn&#39;t that attractive? Well, now they were. If a person not used to the Great Change had entered the police station in the twenty-second precinct where the tentatively identified Shelly Fitzgerald was being questioned(She had volunteered her name after enough prodding, and tests were being run that would match her against the DNA of the missing girl of the same name), they might have assumed they walked onto the set of a porno, considering all the buxom modelesque women in uniforms walking around.<br />
<br />
Shelly had been as cooperative as she could have been under the circumstances. She was still terrified that this was all some elaborate game by her Master. After all, this news about a “Great Change”, everyone on Earth turning into a woman overnight couldn&#39;t possibly be real, could it? Or was it? The Master had lied to her through her entire decade of Hell, being told that he had murdered her parents and all her friends and that there was nobody out looking for her. To emphasize this fact, he would nearly drown her in the basement sink whenever she began to get too uppity for his taste, and would sometimes force her to act as furniture. He would sit his coffee or beer on her torso, and she had to sit there, not moving a muscle. If she spilled just one dropped...boom. Instant beating. In fact, when Shelly had first gone kidnapped, she had made national headlines. There had been a manhunt that circled the globe, but when the leads went cold, and amateur sleuths began to scale back, eventually the public forget about the poor, sweet, virginal girl, just as they always do.<br />
<br />
The detective questioning Shelly was convinced that this woman needed mental health and physical care right away, but first, new woman Amy Stephenson(Formerly Alexi) needed to know just one important detail.<br />
<br />
Shelly, who was wearing donated clothes and had taken a shower, stared hauntingly sad at the dark haired beautiful Amy, who was just the kind of girl her Master would have cut up in front of her and forced her to eat.<br />
<br />
“Despite your being unable to tell us who you are due to your impaired mental state, we have reason to believe that you are the Shelly Fitzgerald that we&#39;ve been looking for, and that your kidnapper was Sean Franklin Myers. Do either of those names ring any bells?”<br />
<br />
Shelly nodded, slowly. She then spoke in a tiny, pipsqueak voice, afraid that he might be behind the two way mirror, listening to her.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m Shelly. He never told me his name.”<br />
<br />
Detective Stephenson passed forward photos of Sean. They were mostly from Instagram, and they showed a muscular, confident looking brown haired man in various places, including Aruba and Jamaica. <br />
<br />
“Does he look familiar?”<br />
<br />
Shelly stared into the face of evil, the person who had tortured her for years. <br />
<br />
“We think he&#39;s responsible for seventeen other missing person&#39;s cases” said Stephenson, now taking out what looked like a diary. “I&#39;m going to show you passages from Sean&#39;s diary, which we confiscated when we entered his home after a neighbor reported him missing. We found the woman you claimed tried to hurt you in the basement, and a not very well hidden torture chamber. I want you to tell me if any of the passages sounds like your captor.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
<br />
“I wish” said Greta as she and Jean sat at a picnic table at the rest stop featuring The Big Cheese, “That nobody will ever correctly identify us or our car as the vehicle that disappeared on the road.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“Hey, Regina and Aziz, I think you both better take a look at this” said James with mild concern in his voice.<br />
<br />
The two new women walked over to the blonde women nursing the two babies. Aziz&#39;s eyes grew like saurcers. This had been only the second time he had seen a woman&#39;s breasts up close, including her own pair. <br />
<br />
“Why can&#39;t she see us?” asked Aziz.<br />
<br />
“I cast a spell” said James. “Safer that way, and I suppose we shouldn&#39;t interrupt what happens next.”<br />
<br />
Regina, Aziz, and James watched the moment where baby Joe had realized his mistake, Greta absconded the ring from him, turned her into Jo, and turned the black baby girl into an attractive adult woman. Just as they began having sex, Regina turned her head away in mild disgust, not knowing that Jean had been an adult turned into a baby, not a baby transformed into an adult.<br />
<br />
“What...what magic is this?” asked Aziz.<br />
<br />
“Hmm” said James. “The ring could be from anyone, but I have a feeling that it could be from Inanna. She&#39;s the patron who&#39;s power we&#39;re competing for.”</p>
