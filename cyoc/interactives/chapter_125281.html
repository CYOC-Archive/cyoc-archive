<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">12 maids created so far. That was actually a big number considering the size of Curt&#39;s house, Anna knew this logically and rationally. But the sheer THRILL of creating more of her and Skyla&#39;s &#39;kind&#39; held a force all its own. <br />
<br />
All the same, she flipped on the &#39;target unconsciously chooses their species, figure, clothes&#39; option. It felt only proper. To Anna, her promise to Skyla only applied to those transformed at the old folks home. She flipped on the &#39;nude&#39; option, and switched on the &#39;busty&#39; option just to tease Skyla about it later. <br />
<br />
As the four maids walked towards the door, Anna spotted the same man at the desk. Her brother had told her she could zap people at her own digression now... Maybe she was doing these lonely single men a favor. She took aim, but at the moment, Emma giggled, and teleported off of Cassidy. The naked tiger woman didn&#39;t seem that surprised. Nor did Kasai.<br />
<br />
Emma reappeared in a mass of sparkles on a table nearby. Emma giggled and kicked her little hoofed feet about off the end of the table. She teleported away again, this time out of Anna&#39;s sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Emma? Please come back dear! This is no time for games!&quot; Anna never thought she&#39;d be the one saying that to someone! <br />
<br />
Emma teleported back in front of her fellow maids. &quot;I&#39;m back!&quot; The unicorn toddler was holding a frilly maid headband nearly made for the shape of her head in her hands, along with a red one with gold highlights that matched Kasai&#39;s dress. She placed on the one meant for herself, then teleported next to Kasai, who giggled and let Emma place the head dress on her. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you go! Now we&#39;re proper maids for Oneesan!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oneesan is for &#39;big sister&#39; Emma, oniisan is for big brother!&quot; Kasai said smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! Silly I forget!&quot; Emma giggled. <br />
<br />
Kasai flapped her wings, proving she could indeed fly, and was on face level with Anna before flapping over to the man at the desk. &quot;Konichiwa Robert!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaisa!&quot; Robert said. &quot;They told me you were going to begin your new cycle soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hai! Oneesans and Oneechan came to take me back to Oniichan so I can be a good meido for him!&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna held her breath, her hand on the way ray gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Robert said, &quot;I&#39;ll just do this paper work for you. Miss Evenson, could you just sign here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna blinked, oh right, the ray gun explicitly made it so nobody would find it strange that whoever was zapped would accept the zapped person as working for Master. &quot;O-okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna leaned down, glancing at the form, the transformation had fixed up her brain, but the legal mumbo jumbo still gave her a headache. Anna sighed her name and it was done. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything of yours you&#39;d like to take with you?&quot; Robert asked Kaisa. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll have Meredith come for it later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Miss.&quot; <br />
<br />
By the time the two naked cat women and the phoenix and unicorn toddlers had walked out of the Azure Springs Retirement Home, Anna realized she&#39;d forgotten to zap Robert, oh well, there was always next time. <br />
<br />
The four maids sat down at the bus stop. Well, Anna sat down, Cassidy stood at attention staying alert like a good bodyguard of her Master&#39;s little sister, and Kasai flew in circle and loop-de-loop above them, while Emma teleported this way and way, including onto the roof.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma! Be careful! You could fall!&quot; Anna said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Emma teleported down next to her. &quot;I&#39;d just teleport safe to the ground, or Kasai would catch me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hai!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if you got knocked out and fell and Kasai wasn&#39;t there?&quot; Anna asked, feeling strangely ironic. &quot;Please don&#39;t teleport somewhere I can&#39;t help you if you get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Okay big sister.&quot; Emma nodded reluctantly.  Anna gave the unicorn a hug, and saw Cassidy smiling at them. <br />
<br />
As good luck would have it, the next bus would take them to the district that Skyla worked her day job as a desk drone. Anna hoped that Skyla would move in with them soon and do her <i>real job</i> as Kurt&#39;s head maid. <br />
<br />
The bus came soon enough, and Cassidy carried Emma as Anna carried Kasai onto the bus. <br />
<br />
There was a mother and her three kids on the bus, a couple of teens, and a young man wearing foreign clothes. And of course the bus driver, middled aged and overweight. <br />
<br />
Anna glanced at the read out on the ray gun, and confirmed he was viable for zapping. <br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s itch trigger finger couldn&#39;t take it anymore after missing Robert. And she took and zapped him. <br />
<br />
The transformation hit like a freight train, like it was responding to Anna&#39;s impatience. It was swift and decisive. <br />
<br />
The man&#39;s clothes vaporized, his fur became almost painfully bright orange, her black &#39;socks&#39; reached up to her calves like they were lingerie, her black &#39;gloves&#39; almost reached up to her upper arms! Her fanny reminded Anna of squashes, while her breasts were like pumpkins! Wavy long brown hair cascaded down her back. Her muzzle and ears were like pointers at where she was looking, and what she wanted. Her equally large fluffy orange tail with a white tip formed a cushion all its own behind her. She was wearing lipstick and eyeliner. Her waist was something Anna thought you could only accomplish with a corset.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, hi Anna! Hey Cassidy! Hi kiddos!&quot; She said in a lively, yet somehow low tone and she waved at the toddlers. &quot;See Kasai finally got a reboot. Here&#39;s hoping you grow up to be just as hot as before kiddo!&quot; She laughed at her own joke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Arigatou!&quot; Kasai replied smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Respect your elders Susan,&quot; the unicorn toddler said to the Buxom fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say Granny,&quot; Susan replied a laugh and a salute. She smiled at Anna, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about paying for your fair, I&#39;ll cover it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike Curt, Anna had no problem with that. &quot;Alright Susan.&quot; Anna said, staring at this vulpine supermodel bus driver she&#39;d just brought into the world. &quot;So... how&#39;s life? How&#39;s the job treating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s boring, but some hot guys come along I can watch for a while. Think Master could use me at the house?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... think Master would prefer if you keep to your day job for him.&quot; Anna said, feeling strangely protective, but not possessive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, like Vicky and Eva! Got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky, was that the name of the mail vixen?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down girls, gotta keep the schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Right!&quot; <br />
<br />
No one on the bus once complained, or even once thought it odd their bus drive was a naked fox woman that could break men&#39;s wills. The maids sat down as Susan drove on. &quot;Going to Head Maid Skyla&#39;s workplace?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Anna said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lovely! Just checkin&#39; sweet thing. Can ya tell&#39;er that I&#39;ve almost got Kitty convinced that she&#39;d be perfect as a maid for Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna started, now she <i>really</i> knew how Master felt. &quot;Uh sure, how is Kitty doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s gotten over that jerk who left her with the kids! Since I moved in to split the rent as her flatmate and look after her kids, she&#39;s been doing great! She&#39;s my best friend now. And I couldn&#39;t ask for a better one!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So... how close... are you two?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
Susan laughed. &quot;Like I said, best friends! She was happy that time after the movies and split the bill on a dinner when I asked to move in with her, she gave me a big hug. We had cake celebrate. I had to throw away my Play Girl magazines though. Couldn&#39;t have Little Suzie finding them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s brain connected the dots.<br />
<br />
Anna realized, while the Ray Gun gave those changed unconditional love towards Curt, the instructions had never said anything about <i>exclusive</i> love toward Curt. However, from the way Susan described things, that kind of love had changed indeed. <br />
<br />
Anna realized maybe Master had a point about not zapping anyone who happened to be zappable. The ray gun was just a machine after all, it could only tell something that fit its parameters. <br />
<br />
Anna didn&#39;t change anyone else on the bus, she didn&#39;t even check. She was zoned out until Susan told her that it was her stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan...&quot; Anna shivered. &quot;Thank you... you&#39;re a wonderful person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it sweetie,&quot; Susan leaned back with a smile, her breasts bouncing on the wheel, showing no sign of strain or backache.<br />
<br />
Anne left with the other maids as Susan drove on. Anna didn&#39;t even look at the humans around her, not caring if she could change them or not. She came to Skyla&#39;s building and stepped inside, the other following her, Cassidy keeping an eye on the toddlers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for Skyla,&quot; Anna said to the woman at the front. She didn&#39;t feel the need to say which Skyla. After being given instructions, Anna made her way to Skyla&#39;s work spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay out here with the kids,&quot; Anna ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Cassidy said holding the hands of the firebird and unicorn. <br />
<br />
The kitsune hugged her the moment she got inside. &quot;You&#39;re finally here! I thought you were gonna leave me high and dry and-... You okay Anna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... it&#39;s nothing to talk about right now,&quot; Anna whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright,&quot; Skyla accepted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s the ray gun,&quot; Anna whispered, giving it SKyla. The Head Maid was surprised she gave it up without fanfare or reluctance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Skyla said, as she looked at the setting. &quot;You change someone without me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have shown me on the phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t think of it, spur of the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Skyla nodded. &quot;I really really get that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Skyla, your boss... they aren&#39;t married are they? They don&#39;t have any adopted children do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s no big deal, they&#39;re still looking after them right? So nothing has changed except they now get the pleasure of loving Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna cringed. And shook her head. There was no undo button, she needed to accept and move on. And Skyla was right, Susan and Kitty were still together, right? <br />
<br />
 &quot;And to answer your questions, no, my boss isn&#39;t married, except to his job, and he doesn&#39;t have any adopted kids. He&#39;s perfect. And this way, me moving in and organizing all of Master&#39;s staff can be my full time job will go a lot smoother! And the boss will get the attitude adjustment he deserves!&quot; Skyla walked out of her work place, and shouted, &quot;HEY! Boss! Got something for you!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla&#39;s boss stepped out, contrary to the stereotype, he was not bald, he was not fat, and he did not have pointy hair, he had white hair that he insisted on keeping long. Woe be to any who dared joke about it behind his head. But he had his fair share of liver spots. His business suit was spotless and had more buttons than Skyla though any suit needed. <br />
<br />
Not that that was going to matter in a moment. <br />
<br />
Skyla zapped him. <br />
<br />
In a flash of light... there was a bipedal white kitten with thumbs and blue eyes. Her only clothing was a pink ribbon around her neck with a bell. She was also now being carried on a silver platter with four tall intimidating men around her that looked like all together they might have been able to take on Cassidy in a fight. She stood with her paws behind her back with a no-nonsense attitude on her face. The employees bowed their head trying to avoid eye contact as she passed, well, that hadn&#39;t changed. <br />
<br />
Her body guards lifted up the kitten so she was face to face with the kitsune. &quot;Well Skyla? What is it? Did Master need something?&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla and Anna were both stunned by this change. Cassidy kept her eyes locked on the other body guards. Emma and Kasai hide behind Cassidy. <br />
<br />
Skyla sucked her breath. &quot;Effectively immediately, I am going to be employed full time at Master&#39;s house as his full chief maid. As such, I will be retiring from your employment.&quot; She unconsciously fanned out her tails behind her to make herself look bigger. &quot;I <i>will</i> be expecting my full severance package and pension, or Master may be <i>very</i> upset with you.&quot; Skyla never raised her voice, speaking with the power and authority she never dreamed she&#39;d speak to her boss with. <br />
<br />
The kitten&#39;s expression never changed. &quot;You think Master doesn&#39;t pay you enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to go tell Master you think I&#39;ve been irresponsible with my job? Or that I haven&#39;t been able to devote myself completely to being his Head Maid because of my employment to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... For the good of Master, I&#39;ll comply Head Maid SKyla,&quot; the kitten bowed. &quot;Shall we arrange your goodbye party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can skip it, I don&#39;t want to keep Master waiting any longer than I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Head maid Skyla.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen walk away, still holding the ray gun. Anyone with eyes could see the swagger in her steps, her tails swaying behind her like she was top of the world.</p>
