<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave woke to the both familiar and unexpected sensation of someone&#39;s back pressed up against his lightly furred chest. His morning wood rested in the crack between Todd&#39;s ass cheeks, his arm draped protectively over the smaller man and holding him close. It felt so good having him there, different, but good. It was only then he registered the soft chiming coming from his cellphone and rolled over to grab the device from off the nightstand. A few messages waited for him, all from Chet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Workout?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be at the gym in 5. On shift today.&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, blow off some steam.&quot;<br />
<br />
He considered for a moment and then tapped out a quick reply. &quot;Be there in 30.&quot; He set his phone back down and pulled away from Todd, stopping only as he felt a hand grab him by his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sneaking off?&quot; Todd&#39;s voice came, teasing, stroking him off just a bit as he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to hit the gym.&quot; But Dave made no move to pull away as Todd still held him. &quot;Gotta keep myself looking hot.&quot; He said with a small grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Todd said it as almost a pout but let him go and rolled back over. &quot;Guess that&#39;s the cost of having a hot guy around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave slipped out of the bed and towards the bathroom. Morning wood on top of the bit of teasing from Todd having left his cock straining outwards. He strode through the house naked and completely unashamed. Even though no one could see him for once he felt confident enough in his own body that he kind of wanted to show off. He felt more vibrant and alive than he had in years, even this morning he felt more energetic than yesterday. Hornier, too.<br />
<br />
He turned on the shower and stepped inside, only giving himself a cursory lather before gripping his cock in his hand. He ran his other hand over his torso, feeling the lines of his own muscles as he jerked himself off. Todd was so sweet and cute, but he wondered what it would be like to be with someone more like him, even just once. For some reason, that faceless muscular man slowly became Chet. His friend and former neighbor dominating him like he did Todd. Bending over against the shower wall as Chet&#39;s cock thrust into him. He knew he had never bottomed before in his life, but if he would for someone, it&#39;d be Chet. He grunted as he came, splashing the shower wall with his cum as he leaned against it for support.<br />
<br />
He sighed. Before this weekend he had never even thought of being with a guy. Now? He had topped one and was fantasizing about another topping him. Why did this not bother him? It felt like it should, but he only felt.. well, mostly horny at the moment. Stepping out of the shower he dried off and gazed at himself in the mirror. He shook his head, as he leaned in closer. His skin was so smooth, not a hint of a wrinkle anywhere. Was he still getting younger, too? He barely looked to be in his late 20s, if even that old. The beard helped, and thinking about how Todd said he liked it decided not to shave. It was a bit scruffy and would need trimming, but for now he left it.<br />
<br />
A quick trip to the smaller bedroom where his stuff still stayed he dressed in a pair of shorts and a tank he was pretty sure he didn&#39;t own a few days ago and dug out a pair of ear buds he definitely didn&#39;t own, but knew right where to find them, deciding to jog his way to the gym a few blocks away. Dave just sort of let his thoughts drift as he jogged. This new life was putting new memories in his mind. His old life felt like a weird dream of which parts still made sense. His parents, his childhood, though getting into sports in high school was different, and of course his family when he thought of them, he was the youngest kid rather than the oldest. A last surprise come when his parents were older.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even notice as the woman at the gym&#39;s front desk greeted him by name, but nodded when she told him, &quot;Chet&#39;s in the weight room.&quot; He headed right in an found the bodybuilder doing some free weights in the otherwise empty room. He was dressed in his gym uniform, the black tank taught enough to show off his muscles. He grinned wide as he spotted Dave. What would it be like to work here instead of his crappy desk job. Doing something so physical day in and day out, something he believed he was beginning to enjoy, rather that stuffing himself in a suit to sit behind a desk.<br />
<br />
Chet got right down to business, guiding Dave through a routine that he felt he should remember, but was like a word stuck on the tip of his tongue. Though Chet clung a bit closer to Dave than he might with his average client. Eventually he perked up and tapped Dave on the shoulder. &quot;Follow my lead.&quot; And nodded towards an older man who was walking through the gym. Older. Dave almost scoffed, he was probably only as old as Dave himself had been a couple days ago, but he was fit and strong, still solid and in his prime. He a black polo with the gym logo on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank!&quot; Chet called out, waving towards the man. The older man looked over to Dave then changed directions to come to them. &quot;Frank! This is the guy I was telling you about yesterday. Dave. I think he has potential. Might need to follow around one of the more seasoned trainers for a bit, but I think he&#39;d be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave tried to keep the look of bafflement off his face as Frank looked him over, rubbing a gray-bearded chin. &quot;Well, you look the part and if Chet&#39;s vouching for you you&#39;re not a complete meat head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I am, no.&quot; Dave said, still a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean?&quot; Frank asked, sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t do steroids.&quot; Frank asked, more flatly.<br />
<br />
Dave just shook his head. &quot;Um, no, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir.&quot; Frank chortled, sounding amused. &quot;I might just give you a chance kid. Stop by my office tomorrow, round noon, we&#39;ll see if you&#39;d be a good fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
It hit Dave like a ton of bricks. Chet was trying to get him a job?! Here?! &quot;Oh, I um..&quot; He stopped himself. Why refuse? Wasn&#39;t he just thinking this would be a better job than his pencil pushing cubicle jockey one? &quot;I look forward to it, thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank nodded and stepped off. Chet clapped him on the back. &quot;Is that why you were pestering me to come out this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chet grinned and nodded. &quot;Knew he&#39;d be stopping by. I mean, after you got fired last week and your roommate kicked you out, I figured I should try to help my best lifting partner find something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fired? Roommate? Dave managed not to say it out loud. He closed his eyes, feeling like a headache was coming on. He could still remember dating Cherise, her kicking him out, leaving work on Friday like nothing was wrong. There was something clearer though, sitting over that like a double exposed piece of film. Cherise as his roommate, someone he had just met. Her wanting more for rent so she kicked him out. Then some stupid mistakes he made at work because he was sleeping in his car, and them letting him go on Friday. Todd offering him a place to crash as he cleared out his desk. Him keeping his buddy and lifting partner Chet up to date, not just a neighbor, an actual friend, but not bunking at his place because of Chet&#39;s revolving door of flings and one night stands. His dating Cherise just didn&#39;t make sense anymore, though still had the memory of his last boyfriend cheating on him. Boyfriend now, all boyfriends since he realized he was gay back in high school. It felt like his old life was just drifting away and part of him wanted to just let it go, a part that was growing bigger and stronger with every passing hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright?&quot; Chet&#39;s voice was concerned as he placed a hand on Dave&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, jus a headache. It&#39;s been a long week.&quot; Dave responded, trying to force a small smile. &quot;I might just head back home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you take a shower first? I&#39;ll even sneak you into the staff locker rooms.&quot; Chet said with a mischievous grin, but Dave nodded in agreement, standing and following his friend to a staff only door near the public locker rooms. Inside was smaller, but it was clean and tidy. Dave stripped slowly, leaving his stuff on a bench as he made his way over to the showers, still feeling a bit in a daze.<br />
<br />
He leaned his head back as he turned on the shower and let the warm water run over him, washing away the sweat of his workout. He only started a little as he felt arms wrap around him from behind, a strong muscular chest pressing against his back. His day dream from his first shower of the day drifting back to him as he lets those strong arms hold him tight, one rough calloused hand going down to his cock, giving the quickly hardening member a few tugs. &quot;Why have you and me never done it?&quot; Chet whispered into his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because a pair of tops doesn&#39;t work.&quot; Dave answered, closing his eyes as Chet slowly jerked him off. He could feel Chet&#39;s cock pressed against him, throbbing and warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even willing to try it just once?&quot; Chet murmured as he removed his other hand from Dave, pressing a finger up against Dave&#39;s hole. The pressure made him shudder. Did he want this? What about Todd? Dave bit his lip, all the possibilities swirling in his head. What if he did give into these, it seemed like every choice he had been making lately changed him more and more.</p>
