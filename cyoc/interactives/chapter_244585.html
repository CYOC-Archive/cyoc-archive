<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coach Thomas let out a loud sigh, slamming his laptop shut. He glanced down at his phone, frowning when he saw the time. Where had his evening gone? He&#39;d been so focused on planning next week&#39;s practice drills that he&#39;d barely noticed as the hours slipped by. He rose from his office desk, slipping his laptop into his satchel bag before slinging it over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Campus was virtually deserted at this time of day, with classes having ended hours ago. He walked through the empty halls towards the school&#39;s gym facilities, his destination being the men&#39;s locker room. He was currently dressed in black gym shorts and a navy blue workout shirt, but had a change of clothes stashed in his locker; he didn&#39;t like being sweaty on his lengthy commute back home.<br />
<br />
As Coach Thomas entered the changeroom, he nearly bumped into Chase, one of his students. The young man&#39;s hair was wet, indicating he&#39;d just been in the showers. He was dressed in blue jeans and a form fitting t-shirt, his backpack hanging around his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Coach,&quot; Chase smiled warmly, quickly sidestepping to get out of Coach Thomas&#39; path. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chase,&quot; Thomas nodded in acknowledgment, &quot;You&#39;re here late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I decided to hit the gym. Trying to put on some muscle,&quot; Chase laughed sheepishly, glancing away from Thomas.<br />
<br />
Chase was technically on the college team, but he was a glorified benchwarmer who rarely saw any field time. The young man had a toned but slender frame which made him ill fit as a football player. Thomas had only put him on the roster because he felt sorry for Chase and he didn&#39;t have enough players with actual talent to fill the team. And although Coach Thomas tried not to admit it - even to himself - he found himself inexplicably attracted to the younger man. Keeping him around in the locker room wasn&#39;t a purely selfless endeavor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I got to get going. Have a good weekend, Coach.&quot; Chase gave Thomas another smile before heading out of the locker room, the door swinging shut behind him and leaving Thomas alone with his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thomas made his way over to his locker and began to absentmindedly rifle through it, his thoughts still thinking of Chase. In his many years as coach at the college, he had never made an improper advance towards a student. He knew he couldn&#39;t act on any of his urges towards Chase, but that didn&#39;t stop Thomas from fantasizing about the younger man. <br />
<br />
Coach Thomas was snapped put of his daydream when he noticed a pair of yellow underwear sitting on one of the locker room benches. Thomas found himself drawn towards the bright neon briefs. He could see that they were damp with sweat, indicating they&#39;d been freshly worn; Chase must have forgotten to pack them into his bag after his workout. Thomas picked the briefs up; they were damp to the touch, drenched in perspiration. Thomas brought the briefs up to his face and took a long, deep sniff. The underwear smelled of Chase&#39;s body spray mixed with body odor. With his free hand, Thomas reached down and stroked his hardening member through his shorts.<br />
<br />
On a rational level, Thomas knew his behavior was unacceptable. He was violating Chase with his actions, but he was so horny it was difficult to think straight. He was holding the used underwear of his unrequited crush, and felt an overwhelming urge to try them on. Just the thought of his cock wearing Chase&#39;s briefs made his erection leak precum. Thomas rationalized that there was no harm in quickly trying the briefs on; maybe giving in to his urges would alleviate some of his feelings towards Chase. He slid his shirt and shorts off, quickly followed by his own boxers, leaving the middle aged man naked. With his hands trembling in excitement, Thomas pulled Chase&#39;s briefs up his legs and over his rock hard dick.<br />
<br />
Thomas admired his reflection in the locker room mirror, flexing his muscles. For a man nearing 50, he was still pretty damn sexy. His hairline had started to recede and it felt like there was more gray in his beard every day, but he was still handsome. His body had softened over the years and he now had a paunch where his abs had once been. His hard earned muscles were still there, though, with broad shoulders and thick, beefy pecs. The yellow briefs clung tightly to his massive member, leaving little to the imagination.<br />
<br />
Thomas stroked himself through the briefs, panting heavily. He imagined Chase on his knees before him, with Thomas&#39; hard cock between Chase&#39;s lips. It would be so hot to spray his cum all over Chase&#39;s cute, angelic face.<br />
<br />
Thomas continued to feel himself, his body electric. His eyes were closed, still daydreaming about Chase, so he was unaware as his body started to shift. The dark brown hairs along his forearms lightened to blonde, slowly retracting back into his skin. If he&#39;d been paying attention, he would have noticed that his forearms and biceps weren&#39;t as defined as they&#39;d been moments before, his frame shedding muscle. His shoulders slimmed down as well, his body changing from broad and bulky to a more slender frame.<br />
<br />
His beefy pecs deflated, leaving Thomas flat chested. Next, his muscle gut dissolved, sinking in to reveal a tight smooth stomach. The dark hairs covering his chest and stomach lightened, growing sparse. His stomach continued to tighten, leaving him with the faint definition of abs. Thomas&#39; thick waist narrowed, followed by his thighs and quads slimming down. Thomas&#39; round, muscled ass firmed up, losing some of its roundness. His short dark hair grew lighter and longer, curling into a messy hairstyle while his beard vanished. Thomas&#39; square jaw rounded, his mature handsome face softening to a man in his early twenties. <br />
<br />
Thomas let out a guttural grunt, his deep voice now softer and higher pitched. His entire body spasmed as his cock erupted, spurting a thick stream of cum into the briefs he was wearing. As he came, Thomas&#39; massive member began to shrink, growing thinner and shorter with every spurt. His ballsack contracted, his testicles shriveling down in size. He was hit with a wave of dizziness as his memories altered, Coach Thomas&#39; experiences and thoughts being overwritten by Chase&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Chase opened his eyes, looking around the locker room in a daze. He couldn&#39;t remember where he was or how he&#39;d gotten there, as if he&#39;d just awoken from a dream. Chase glanced down at himself, blushing when he realized the briefs he was wearing were drenched in cum. Did he seriously just get off in the locker room? <br />
<br />
Chase hurried to his locker, anxious to get dressed. He was distraught to find his locker was completely empty with no clothes anywhere in sight. Looking around the room, he noticed that Coach Thomas&#39; locker was wide open. Without a better idea, Chase searched Thomas&#39; locker for something he could wear. His Coach was a lot bigger than him, but Chase found a pair of black shorts and a navy blue compression shirt that somewhat fit him, even though they were baggy on his lean body.<br />
<br />
Chase promised himself he&#39;d return the clothes first thing in the morning after he&#39;d had a chance to get some of his own clothes. Not wanting to spend any more time in the locker room for fear of Coach Thomas walking in and finding Chase wearing his clothes, Chase promptly fled from the locker room to make his way back home.</p>
