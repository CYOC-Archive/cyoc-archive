<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully before she even had the chance to descend into another pleasure spiral, she got interrupted.<br />
<br />
Not by a sense of decency or some remnant of her remaining cautiousness as to what overusing the app would do to her.<br />
<br />
No, what interrupted her was, plain and simple, hunger.<br />
<br />
Not even a second after Amber contemplated using the app again was she loudly interrupted by her stomach, growling for food.<br />
<br />
And with that empty feeling in her stomach she too noticed how parched she was as well, dry throat crying out for sweet water.<br />
<br />
With that serving as a distraction from her own thoughts, she was reminded that all of yesterdays proclivities were done without eating or drinking even once, and she had spent quite a lot of calories indeed.<br />
<br />
The gnawing hunger and thirst that hit her had to be satisfied.<br />
<br />
Begrudgingly, she stopped herself from using the app to fix it. She wanted to experience her current body more anyway without more changes hogging her attention and eating when one is uncomfortably hungry and quenching ones thirst had its own appeal. With a course of action planned, she just remembered to get her charger from her bedroom, to plug it back into her phone after she got to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
On the way there, another small problem presented itself. The memories she had gotten of her new life didn’t cancel out her previous muscle-memory. For something new, like her dick, it wasn&#39;t a problem, the new memories didn’t come into conflict with anything, but it was with her new center of balance that she found trouble.<br />
<br />
Before, in her rush to clean herself and then the scare about being late to work, she didn’t really notice what was happening and attributed her clumsiness to sleepiness and adrenaline respectively, but on her leisurely walk to the kitchen that was no longer possible.<br />
<br />
She had to lean on the walls of her apartment a bit not to fall over as she tried to figure out what was wrong.<br />
<br />
Simply put, her tail and breasts totally changed how she had to walk, and the new memories trying to guide her conflicted with her old muscle-memory on how she had to move. It caused her to lean too far forward one moment and over correct the next. It must have looked pretty comical to an outside observer, a dickgirl with draconic features drunkenly stumbling through her own home.<br />
<br />
The trek to her kitchen took entirely too long for her liking, but at least the last few meters she got the hang of it. Her new center of balanced forced her to lean forward more while walking to not fall over backwards. Turns out a tail as long as she was tall was heavy, who would&#39;ve thought.<br />
<br />
At least the new posture she was forced to adapt had a benefit, getting her new package to hang slightly farther forward and to not get it caught between her generous thighs. The light slapping of her genitals hitting her legs accompanied her the entire way.<br />
<br />
Just as she arrived at her kitchen countertop she figured out what she wanted to eat. Killing two birds with one stone sounded good and so she prepared some cereal for herself, food and drink in one.<br />
<br />
After an embarrassing fumble that spilled a bit of milk over the rim of the bowl and nearly onto her phone, as she was distracted by adjusting her posture once again, she carefully shuffled over to a table with the overfilled bowl of cereal in her hands.<br />
<br />
Sitting down and taking a second to find the most comfortable position, she also noticed that she now only had chairs without any sort of backrest, presumably because of her tail. Checking her memories confirmed it.<br />
<br />
Now that she finally had something to eat she had time to think about her current situation. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the freedom the app granted her was its own problem. How could she decide what to do when she could quite literally do anything with just a touch of creativity and a bit of wordplay?<br />
<br />
Playing around with herself had brought her pleasure she couldn’t have imagined before, and changing people at the office, although quite tame in relation to what she had done to herself, had still been the start of it all. Once she started she couldn’t stop until she had literally orgasmed so much she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
With these thoughts in her head Amber wasn&#39;t as focused on what her body was doing as she probably should&#39;ve been. As she spun increasingly ludicrous fantasies in her own head and robotically eating her cereal spoonful after spoonful, her breasts got in the way more and more.<br />
<br />
Their increased size and number meant that with each time she brought the spoon to her mouth, her arm rubbed her breasts together, squishing them into each other. Flesh gliding against flesh, each fleeting motion of one triggering the others to move as well. That alone would not have been that big of a deal, if it weren’t for her pussies also getting in on the action, each spoonful massaging them with her arm was a sensation she never felt before.<br />
<br />
Her new coverings in the form of her breasts skin flaps concealing them was only hiding her aroused state. As her pussies were getting wet and starting to leak, not one drop escaped her breasts clutches and accumulated behind her skin flaps, which only her hands, or those of someone else, could part.<br />
<br />
After a while her eating slowed down as she was too lost in her own head and perverted fantasies to care for food, each spoonful she did get was interrupted by panting breaths. Her breasts had even swollen with all the trapped juices she released, jostling ever more aggressively for space, shoving against each other and stimulating her vaginas more, only worsening the situation.<br />
<br />
At the same time her cock wasn&#39;t without action, as she unconsciously started rubbing her thighs together.<br />
<br />
Skin slid over skin and caught lightly on the ridges of her draconic cock, which itself started to move slightly, wriggling back and forth in unconscious motions. Her balls were trapped beneath a soft cock and glistening thighs as she began to sweat slightly from the arousal her perverted mind and changed body once more forced onto her.<br />
<br />
All this time her cock stayed soft yet incredibly sensitive, slowly gliding from side to side, rubbing against her. It didn’t take long for the first bead of pre to flow from her tip, lubricating the space between her legs.<br />
<br />
Amber continued to eat, slowly, unaware of what she was doing to herself until, with a loud ‘clink’, her spoon hit the bottom of her cereal bowl.<br />
<br />
Her concentration shattered and suddenly she was in the now again. Why was she so hot? Why was she out of breath?<br />
<br />
At first she didn’t even stop slowly rubbing her legs together, looking into her empty bowl quizzically. Then she noticed her breasts, which intruded into her field of view even more so than before. That finally got her to notice the small glimpse she got of her dick, rhythmically moving back and forth, back and forth over her lap, spreading pre cum all over and dripping it down onto her tiled floor.<br />
<br />
Awareness only brought the burning heat to the forefront as if it no longer got quenched by the cool milk of her cereal.<br />
<br />
All the fantasies she had in her head got jumbled together into a huge mess that could best be described as ‘every teenage boys wet dream ever’ and she had only one thought left that echoed through her mind.<br />
<br />
‘I need to get off.’<br />
<br />
Jacking off normally didn’t even occur to her in the moment, so needy and desperate was her body after having unknowingly edged herself over the course of the last 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
With a dull ‘thud’ her dick hit the underside of the table, finally allowed to get properly erect thanks to her attention. A shock of pleasure trembled through her body, the tip of her cock left a smear of pre on the underside of her table as she stood up abruptly, her breasts swinging with her motion, now more like filled water balloons thanks to all of her juices that had accumulated.<br />
<br />
She blinked once and was suddenly in front of her phone, the distance from the table and kitchen proper just a blur in her mind in her rush to use the app.<br />
<br />
With new clarity thanks to having eaten something and being at least a little more awake than before cleaning herself, she wouldn&#39;t take long to generate a sentence, but a thought stayed her hand.<br />
<br />
She had only thought to target herself before, but could she also target only parts of herself?<br />
<br />
She couldn’t wait until she hit a good sentence, she was desperate.<br />
<br />
With her warm tip of her cock seemingly burning a hole in the bottom of her engorged breasts and smearing cum all over their underside, she tried to target it directly.<br />
<br />
“Ambers draconic penis barely reached her breasts”<br />
<br />
Good enough.</p>
