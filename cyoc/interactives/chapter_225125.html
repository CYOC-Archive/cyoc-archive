<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, Jack, are you ready to go to kindergarten in an all girl&#39;s school?&quot;, asked Madame. Jack replied, &quot;Can I ask you some questions? I&#39;m fine with going to kindergarten, but are there any lower classes or special education classes? I&#39;m curious about what other lower classes are there. I just want to make sure that having the mind of a five year old girl in kindergarten would be a good fit for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still want to be a girl going to an all girl&#39;s school and wear the required school uniform, but I would like to start at the bottom if it&#39;s possible.  All of a sudden a loud boom could be heard from beneath the stage as Paul hit his head on the stage floor.  Madame Illusia suspected something was up and so teleported what ever it was on to the stage.  When Madame discovered it was Paul, the first thing she did was freeze him, but allowed him to speak.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry Madame Illusia!  I was just terrified of all the fighting and so I took the opportunity to try to ghost out.  I would have stayed here until you were gone and then leave, but I hit my head on your stage and you caught me.  If you&#39;re not mad at me, can I still have the mind of a 6th grade 12 year old?&quot;, said Paul in fear.  No, Your friend over there has other plans and so I&#39;m going to make you take his place!  Because you ran away you&#39;re going to have the mind of a five year old girl in kindergarten at an all girl&#39;s school.  Meanwhile, your friend Jack wants to start at the very bottom of said school.  Guess what!  They happen to have not only a nursery, but they also special education classes.  He&#39;s going to be enrolled at the lowest of the low with no chance of ever leaving that special needs nursery he&#39;s going to be enrolled in.  All he&#39;ll ever be in mind is a cute little 18 month old with the intellect of a two week old.  His mind will be no different from those two in the tanks over there or your other friend Chelsea who&#39;s currently sleeping in her baby carrier.  Heck, even Monica will be smarter than him.  With that, let the transformations begin!&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  Both Paul and Jack were lifted up off the ground a little bit.  Both men&#39;s clothes completely disappeared leaving them completely naked.  Jack&#39;s boner was still stiff while Paul looked at Jack with a pissed look on his face.  The crowd thought that Jack&#39;s boner was hilarious, but they were soon to be disappointed.  &quot;Jack, your boner isn&#39;t a good fit for being my precious extra special little girl.&quot;, said Madame.  Jack was excited, he hadn&#39;t told Madame about his desire to lose his sexuality and to be an 18 month old girl with the intellect of a two week old, that sounded like heaven.  He really was getting his wildest dreams come true.  His testicles  and ball sack shrank and shrank and shrank away until there was nothing more.  Madame didn&#39;t want to give him ovaries, but he couldn&#39;t keep his testicles due to his naughty nature.  Jack&#39;s 10 inch penis also shrank away until it was nothing more than a an inch erect and a third of an inch in circumference.  &quot;There you go Jack, you won&#39;t be getting anyone pregnant any time soon with that thing, not that you&#39;ll be able to think about sex when I&#39;m done with you&quot;, stated Madame Illusia.  The crowd was in an uproar again, even Tina chuckled knowing she was feeling a bit moist herself after thinking about one of the teen hunks in the crowd.  She then magicked away both men&#39;s body hear leaving their skin baby smooth.  Afterwards, the men&#39;s head hair grew out, though Paul&#39;s hair grew out more than Jack&#39;s.  Each man&#39;s hair then tied itself into pigtails, though Jack&#39;s pigtails stuck out to the sides a little bit while Paul&#39;s pigtails  were much longer.  A green terry bib with vinyl backing formed around Jack&#39;s neck and reached all the way down to his naval as the part that went around his neck and continued to go around Jack&#39;s arms kind of like a shirt with no sleeves.  The back of his bib only came down to just below his armpits and had three snaps in the back that could be opened when needed to be put on or removed.  The next thing to form were the men&#39;s undergarments.  Both men&#39;s loins started to be covered in white.  Paul&#39;s undergarment took on a thick white fabric becoming toddler panties while Jack&#39;s undergarment thickened out and took on the look of a white disposable diaper with a &quot;cloth-like&quot; outer backing.  The print on both men&#39;s undergarments were the same, an orange smiling sun with pink hearts surrounding it.  A simple white short sleeved blouse formed on both men, but in Jack&#39;s case, his blouse turned into a simple onesie.  Afterwards, both men watched as a green plaid jumper formed over the men&#39;s white tops that did nothing to hide Jack&#39;s onesie covered diaper bulge.  But, Paul got little better as even when he stood still, everyone would see the very bottom of his panties.  Paul would have to be very careful to not flash his panties to anyone, but Madame would guarantee that Paul would be anything but careful about his panties.  short white socks with ruffles appeared on both men&#39;s feet followed by patent Mary Janes.  On Jack, a mint green special needs helmet formed over his head and covered his ears.  The helmet extended much lower than a typical special needs helmet down the back of Jack&#39;s neck stopping at the shoulders It also had a face shield and a chin cup, though the face shield had a cut-out around Jack&#39;s mouth and his eyes so that he could still put things in his mouth if he wanted and so that he could see as well.  Through all of that, Jack&#39;s bib remained on top of all his other clothes.  After all that, a clear feeding tube poked out of Jack&#39;s nose, went around his ear and stuck out of his helmet for ease of connection to a feeding pump.  White tape covered the tube in various places securing it to Jack&#39;s face.  Madame then magicked in a large pink special needs stroller for Jack to rest in.  What was unusual about it was that it actually was in a reclined position so that Jack would more lay in it than sit in it.  Jack looked at it licking his lips in anticipation  wondering what it would feel like to sit in such a contraption.  He knew that he was locking himself into an &quot;undesirable&quot; fate, but the thrill was just too much.  &quot;Boys, are you ready for your mental transformation?&quot;, asked Madame.  Paul whined, &quot;Please don&#39;t, I beg you.&quot; while Jack, being super thrilled, shook his head in a vigorous yes.  The crowd continued to laugh at the spectacle in front of them.  Two men were about to step into the lives of very young girls.  The icing on the cake was Jack who eagerly agreed to Madame&#39;s new change of plans.  &quot;Paul, I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re going to have to step in for Jack, no exceptions.  Smart big boys stay on stage as their told.  You were acting like a kindergartner and so a kindergartner you shall be.&quot;, said Madame.  Jack was then transported through the air to his special seat and was then placed in it resting his feet in the cups of the foot board.  The straps then snapped closed trapping him inside.  Then the straps on his foot board secured themselves leaving his feet unable to move except for a tiny bit.  He had not only shoulder straps, but also a crotch strap and two waist straps that met in the middle of a buckle.  He looked at the buckle and discovered that it would need a special key to unlock it.  Jack also noticed that the shoe buckles had a similar lock on it.  He smiled at that.  This chair was comfortable.  What jack didn&#39;t pay attention to was that his special needs stroller was a little different than others.  His head rest had wings to it.  Hip abductors were at either side of his hips so that they would have only a little room to wiggle around in.  And finally Madame had picked up a knee abductor in one hand while grabbing a wheel chair tray with a lip on it so that anything on it like food would be contained on it.  She walked up to Jack&#39;s special needs stroller, sat the tray off to the side and snapped in the knee abductor forcing his knees to spread wide. The act forced Jack to show off the onesie and the diaper bulge under Jack&#39;s school jumper.  Jack&#39;s diaper was clearly sticking out of the leg holes of his onesie and the crowd noticed and pointed fingers at him.  Jack didn&#39;t care, though, he was getting his strange wish.  At least he&#39;d get to be with his friends.  Paul, meanwhile was still suspended frozen in the air.  He was able to look around, but that was all.  He looked at Jack and a tear came to his eye.  He felt pity for Jack and all of his other friends, but especially Jack because he was taking the brunt of a storm.  Though Jack wanted to be in his position, it didn&#39;t settle well with Paul.  Jack would look ridiculous as a special needs toddler girl in a grown man&#39;s body under normal conditions.  Jack&#39;s saving grace was that no one at the school, not even Jack would know that he&#39;s actually an adult male.  That at least made Paul feel a small bit better. Staring at Jack, Paul watched as Madame Illusia picked up the special needs tray and snapped it in place.  He knew the clock was dead.  Paul started to silently cry as Madame Illusia reached through Jack&#39;s helmet and touched jack&#39;s forehead.  At first, Paul couldn&#39;t see a difference, but then Jack visibly started to relax.  His eyes slowly started to take on a dull look and eventually Jack started to drool, his bib catching most of it.  Jack&#39;s body then began to twitch like any two week old&#39;s body would.  That&#39;s why all of the attachments on Jack&#39;s special needs stroller were needed.  Paul knew Jack was finished.  The only thoughts Jack would have now would be proto-thoughts.  Jack wasn&#39;t aware of himself anymore.  all he could do was experience emotions tied to his bodily functions, coo, blow the occasional spit bubble, twitch, and clench his fists.  There was one last thing that madame forgot.  Thick yellow nursery print padded mittens formed on Jack&#39;s hands.  Jack was complete!  Madame then turned to Paul, left him frozen, and set him standing on the stage.  She had to finish things off fast, morning light was fast approaching.  She didn&#39;t say anything.  She merely stuck her finger onto Paul&#39;s forehead.  Paul knew this was the end of the line for him.  His saving grace was at least he was going to be a happy five-year-old girl.  Lots of things left Paul&#39;s mind.  Most of his vocabulary disappeared leaving him with only 2,000 simple words.  He could only count to ten and he could only follow three simple instructions at a time.  He still could put on his clothes, but at least he can fasten big buttons and take off his clothes with help.  He became very inquisitive about the world and was eager to ask lots of questions.  He also developed a propensity to talk about things he did during the day.  The idea of playing house with his friends sounded like a great idea.  But most importantly, all of his big boy thoughts were gone and only little girl thoughts remained.  He developed an interest in Hello Kitty and My Little Pony.  In his mind, he hoped that mummy would buy him a Hello Kitty back-pack for kindergarten.  He was looking forward to starting his first day at an all-girl&#39;s school.  It sounded so cool to him.  He did consider if he should ask mommy to call him Paula, though.  And with that, Madame released him and he took over Damon&#39;s spot, but not before removing the wooden animals from Deborah&#39;s playpen.  He knew he was too old for these toys, but he&#39;d have to make do.  Beside Paul, Damon snored peacefully.  He got his wish to be in Pre-K.  What he wasn&#39;t expecting when he was a grown-up was a large family.  Tina looked around at all the stinkers surrounding her.  There would be a lot of diapers to change, but she didn&#39;t mind.  She loved them all, including the tank babies.  Deborah, had a new, but much younger playmate.  Madame Illusia needed to watch those two to make sure Deborah wouldn&#39;t hurt Chelsea.  Of course, she&#39;d have to watch out for Jack and Paul to keep them safe as well. Monica perked her ears up in her crate.  Somehow she figured that she&#39;d have to protect a lot of people.  She then rested her head back down and fell back to sleep.  As for Madame Illusia, she finally got her wish.</p>
