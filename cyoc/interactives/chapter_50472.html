<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice had only seen her aunt's house through the mirror before, and thus was quite <br />
curious what it was like when seen from the outside world.  Of course, the news that <br />
indeed her cousins were gone sting at Alice's heart.  'So many delays, so much waiting, so <br />
much time, and all for nothing.'  Alice sat down on her knees as her mother and auntie <br />
began to sniff out the house more to see where the unknown stranger had been in Fran's <br />
home. <br />
<br />
Alice was curious, it was just who she was, and from her kneeling position she noticed <br />
under a table in the center of the living room a torn up piece of paper. Curious, Alice <br />
reached underneath it, and pulled out the pieces. Treating it like a puzzle, Alice took the <br />
torn up pieces of paper and began to put them together, then realized whatever was <br />
written was on the other side and flipped over the scraps.  Alice started as she put it <br />
together, and would have actually been teary eyed if glass could cry, 'then again glass <br />
wasn't supposed to think and move either.' <br />
<br />
&quot;MOMMA! AUNTIE! Come to me quickly! I have found a message from Abbey and <br />
Samantha!&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla started, that was the first time Alice had used a short hand of any kind, even if it was <br />
just to address her mother. However this was overwhelmed by the urgency of Fran, and <br />
the twins who acted the same, felt the same, and thought the same hurried back to Alice <br />
sitting excitedly in the living room, Alice almost hopping.  <br />
<br />
The twins closed in fast on Alice pressing against the seven and a half glass wolf cub who <br />
excited pointed at the message.  Alice for no apparently reason read the message. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice. Going to Frostvile. Do not know where. Mirrors will be covered up,&quot; There was a sad <br />
face at the end. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you read that? It was just pictures.&quot; Darla said simply. <br />
<br />
Alice pointed at a drawing of a yellow wolf girl in a blue dress,  &quot;That is a picture of me.  <br />
This picture here is Abbey and Samantha with other auntie, this is their car I think, and this <br />
is blue icicles and a bunch of houses, and this shows my mirrors being covered.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla said, &quot;Dear that could just as easily mean 'Alice, we're going to get some ice creams, <br />
leaving a blanket on the mirror so we know you were here.' &quot;<br />
<br />
Alice spoke to her mother, &quot;Adam spent some years in Frostvile before moving to <br />
Glendale. So it makes sense to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran hugged her twin, &quot;And sister, it's... pretty clear that Julie took the girls -somewhere-. <br />
This is the best clue we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla thought alike to Fran, &quot;Yes sister you're right.  But I wonder why it was torn up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm wondering that too. ... Unless someone didn't want Alice to find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice, one for common sense in spite of appearance when it suited her said, &quot;Someone <br />
wanted to keep me from reading it. That is highly improper and not polite at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla thought, &quot;And why not just throw it in the garbage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla thought and replied, &quot;We think. That when they left they were in a hurry, and <br />
emotionally charged, and hurried along,  and didn't think it through.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran sat down on he couch, her twin followed, the bounce of their bodies identical and <br />
they both echoed a sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;They could be anywhere.&quot; Fran said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frostvile is not gigantic, but it's not like we can go door to door look for her.&quot; Darla <br />
continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if she's outside Glendale's city limits, then the game is useless.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice perked up and hopped between her mother and aunt put a glass paw on both their <br />
shoulders as she stood on the couch (feeling not proper but kindness was needed right <br />
now), &quot;We can do nothing about the game -- Unless of course the dirt from inside the city <br />
limits of Glendale counts for a limited amount of time and carry a jar of dirty with us, but <br />
that could or could not work since the rules of the game themselves seem very very <br />
contrived and full of loopholes and not very well thought out at all, I mean the 'I dare you <br />
to answer Transform next' who unfair can one be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla got the feeling her daughter had an idea and had gotten verbally side tracked, &quot;Alice, <br />
what are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was strange almost for Darla to feel this way for a glass wolf child who was an adult <br />
man with no relation to her a week ago. Almost. Adam no longer existed, anymore than <br />
Daryl did. <br />
<br />
&quot;If they are covering up the mirrors wherever they are, unless they are having an official <br />
'cover up your mirrors days', which I can not imagine -why- anyone would have a day like <br />
that except maybe if they did not want to look at themselves for a day--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice.&quot; Darla implored.<br />
<br />
&quot;If wherever they are they are covering up the mirrors, that means I can just find the place <br />
that has the most covered up mirrors and look there to see if our family is there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla and Fran looked at each other, then tackled Alice, hugging her like mad, together <br />
they said, &quot;Alice! You are the most wonderful girl in the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice giggled under the affection. After three minutes of this the pair got up. <br />
<br />
&quot;But this still won't make us able to use the game outside of Glendale.&quot; Fran said.<br />
<br />
Darla said, &quot;Maybe it didn't work on Mr. P because it can only work face to face? Or <br />
something similar to that?&quot; Alice had no idea Kyle had transformed Jennifer over the <br />
telephone. <br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;No. We have no way of knowing that one way or another, and I'm the only one <br />
of us still with our turn. Not mention we don't know if BOTH limits apply instead.&quot; The <br />
twins had no idea that Kyle had transformed Jennifer over the telephone.  &quot;Alice can bring <br />
Abbey and Samantha into the mirror easily enough. But Julie can't be changed into a she <br />
wolf by Martha for another two to three weeks. And who knows what'll happen by then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice suggested, &quot;Maybe once cousins are like me, we can invite Auntie Julie back to <br />
Glendale and use the turn on her once she arrives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would likely mean exposing ourselves and the pack Alice.&quot; Darla said, &quot;Master would <br />
decidedly not approve of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded, &quot;We do not need to bring her to the estate until she has become your <br />
triplet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;Alice it would still be out in the open, not in an area we control like the estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can set up a place that we do control in the meantime? One that would not lead <br />
people back to the estate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran sighed, so many variables, so many variables. The twins had been hoping unspoken <br />
that Fran might have been able to convince Julie to willingly share their new lives together, <br />
if Fran could just get Julie to see that she still loved her and just wanted her to share in her <br />
new life as part of the pack.  'Now she might be running scared.' The twins thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice.&quot; Darla said, &quot;Find Abbey and Samantha if you can. Then we'll focus on Julie. Perhaps <br />
we can still get her to join the pack peacefully.&quot; 'At this point we're just a glorified nudist <br />
commune while feeding Master's creature comforts. We're Big and we're Bad. We're not -<br />
that- bad off.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I PLEASE bring them into the mirror? PLEASE?&quot; Alice asked pleading. <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla looked at each other then at Alice looking at them with (literal) puppy dog <br />
eyes. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The collage graduate foreman with a degree in construction and architecture with his <br />
horde of (relatively loyal) day workers behind stared at the sight in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm up here.&quot; Said Caroline simply crossing her arms. <br />
<br />
The foreman looked up, &quot;Sorry about that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Happens a lot in my family.&quot; Replied the dark blue lady Big Bad Wolf simply. <br />
<br />
While the day workers were all stunned and surprised at seeing a naked furry wolf woman <br />
greet them at the Smith estate, none of them ran away screaming or wondered what <br />
monster movie she had walked out of.  They knew they were looking at a giant wolf <br />
woman, but the fact she shouldn't logically exist seemed to fly over their heads and <br />
instead registered her as 'sexy yet dangerous' client. The fact she was naked rang even -<br />
less- bells in their heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;So miss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Caroline will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Caroline, you're one of the Smiths?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely. I'm just here to keep an eye on you while you do your job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the big gate you guys want turned into a all prettied up version of fort Knox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes pretty much. We also want it all done before Sunday evening.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible.&quot; The foreman said flatly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Double your pay.&quot; Caroline said following Bart's instructions exactly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say impossible? I meant very possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure.&quot; Caroline replied flatly. <br />
<br />
Some of the day workers behind the foreman mutters to themselves about the stone <br />
female wolf-demon-things staring down at them from their perch on the wall. Of course <br />
they were just lifeless stone. But they still scared the day workers plenty of enough, like an <br />
odd feeling in their gut of BEING watched somehow. <br />
<br />
Caroline was sure that the lot of the construction grunts would get the work done a LOT <br />
faster as Big Bad She-Wolves, 'Must not be impulsive.' Caroline thought.  Master had <br />
spoken that they were only to use the game for the greater good of the pack and with the <br />
master's permission.  And Caroline in her official unofficial position as forewolf wasn't <br />
sure about needing to keep track of five more sets of names to manage and coordinate. A <br />
part of her still wanted to reward the foreman with she-wolf-hood for what would be his <br />
hard work (something Caroline could appreciate), but again worried about being too <br />
impulsive like Alpha Female. <br />
<br />
Caroline laid down some rules, &quot;You are not to touch the statues -at all-, your men are <br />
not to go inside or out of your sight, you will treat any members of the house hold you <br />
interact with with respect. If one of your men is found where he doesn't belong we'll <br />
consider that a home invasion and defend ourselves as is our legal right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The foreman look at those claws sticking out of those dark blue paws, &quot;R-right.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We have one major problem you know.&quot; Said Hope as Kalyee stretched out on her and the <br />
others before her copies would head back to Zackery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Kaylee asked only mildly interested in what a piece of her 'chair' had to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;If the other half of the transform doesn't apply to Zack. Doesn't that mean his parents will <br />
still remember him? They'll be back early next week. And they might cause us trouble....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pst.&quot; Kaylee said not sounding all that worried, &quot;And when they return Zack and you will <br />
be waiting for them. After the game they'll be either pups, anime colored she wolves, or <br />
part of the estate's fountains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't worried?&quot; 'Belle asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does Zack know when they'll be back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope answered, &quot;Yes I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any chance of them coming back early or late?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance in -hades.-&quot; Grace replied intensely.  &quot;They're way too methodical even with <br />
vacation time. They also make sure any messages from Glendale get bounced back during <br />
that time, their house could burn down and they wouldn't find out until they got back. <br />
That includes Zylphia skipping a few days of school. And they also don't bother to call <br />
Zylphia at all. They trust her utterly home alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee asked, &quot;How do you know all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've spent sleep overs at Zylphia's before Alpha Female.&quot; Hope answered with Kaylee on <br />
her backside with 'Belle and Grace propping up Kaylee's sides. &quot;They're as straight as rods <br />
and stiff as boards. Zylphia never really acted much like them at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee was glade she had had a loving family, who were now her loving children. &quot;I'll <br />
inform Master, and they were will be nothing to worry. You'll be there to make sure <br />
Zackery doesn't try anything funny with them. We'll decide if they should be added to the <br />
art collection, the pups, or to the anime color brigade in the mean time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; They all replied. <br />
<br />
'Belle asked, &quot;But won't this mean tipping our paw that we know that Zackery wasn't fully <br />
effected by the Transform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By then I hope you'll have figured out if he's worth wasting a turn to fix him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he can't have kittens?&quot; Hope laughed. The others giggled as well.<br />
<br />
Kaylee replied leaning back against Grace who held the position perfectly, &quot;No. Stick with <br />
what Master has told you to use the turn for if it becomes need be. Zackery is -still- the <br />
perfect male for the lower she wolves so they don't come between me and Master. Now <br />
that Roger and Lawrence had been made akin to him, and with Nick already a perfectly <br />
good male already, the four of them should have no trouble keeping the females or any <br />
new ladies added to the pack in line and content.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People do not wish to be free, they wish to be comfortable.&quot; Hope said quoting from <br />
somewhere to her clink leader. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just about, yes.&quot; Kaylee nodded.<br />
<br />
This attitude left the Kaylee's three body molded underlings with only more respect and <br />
admiration for her. Kaylee had decidedly become one of the girls, a very large upgrade <br />
from the dork Kyle had been. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
After the defense class had ended, Nicole circled Martha, who stood perfectly still, Martha <br />
was Omega after all, the lowest of the low. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress Nicole?&quot; The silver wolf monster's two heads asked the gray she wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm going to have to invent a totally different routine for you Martha. Not only do <br />
you have two extra arms, but you also have two extra weak points.&quot; She pointed at <br />
Martha's two extra breasts. &quot;Not to mention your two heads and two tails. Traditional <br />
katas and routine I think are simply not suited for your design. I fact I think I'm going to <br />
have to consider how to teach and what to teach with considering our tails as a factor. <br />
They help keep balance but they're also something an opponent can grab.... I might have <br />
to give you some private lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not worth the time.&quot; The two heads bowed closing their three solid red eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;You guard and look after the pups, if trouble finds it's way inside the manor, you and Mr. <br />
P are going to be their only immediate line of defense. That makes you very much worth <br />
the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress Nicole.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicole had to admit, even using the routine saved for ordinary humans, Martha had been <br />
melodic in her use of the kata. Nicole wondered how well she danced. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT happened-?!&quot; Jensen asked not liking the answer he had just heard at all. In the tea <br />
room, causing the relatively small room to shake.   The twins were on their hands and <br />
knees their tails and noses low before Master. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master,&quot; Darla began, &quot;Be careful, your bandages come off today, and you don't want to <br />
dislocate your new tooth before it-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind that! Are you saying your family is gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;Yes Master it is.&quot;  Jensen didn't admit he had gotten the twins mixed up, then <br />
again, they were mirror images of each other down to the last detail. &quot;Alice thinks my <br />
daughters left her a message they'd be in Frostvile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought, oh yes, that was where Great-Grandpa had had his business. <br />
<br />
Alice behind the twins merely nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... easy come... easy go...&quot; Jensen laid back down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll create a doctor for the pack another way... maybe one of Zack's parents ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;wait-wait-wait-wait!&quot; Fran began, &quot;Master you can't just mean?! To let her go?! To let <br />
them go?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla looked equally distress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of Glendale the game is useless. From what you described you've got an unknown <br />
factor involved with your wife who could be anything from a tax collector to a witch. I am <br />
not risking the pack like that: If I wanted to, I'd go with Bart's grandiose fantasy of <br />
'Wolfdale.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEASE Master.&quot; Fran implored.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're our family.&quot; Darla added.<br />
<br />
&quot;The -pack- is your family.&quot; Master corrected them. <br />
<br />
The twins  blinked tears, &quot;Master... please... we love you, but we also love Julie. We want <br />
her to join us in loving you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen looked stern, &quot;And if this gets the attention of some all powerful cursed item shop <br />
owner who only doesn't blow up the world cause that would be 'no fun?'&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... &quot; The twins were silent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father.&quot; Alice took a step foreword, &quot;If Julie has indeed become involved in such things... <br />
would not leaving her out there be more dangerous? The best way to learn what she had <br />
told others is to make her mother and Auntie's triplet. Right now the police have no clues <br />
on the vanishing of mother and auntie. And also, because she is in Frostvile right now, if <br />
Abbey and Samantha become your daughters while there, it'll cause less commotion within <br />
Glendale, and people in Frostvile are a thousand times less likely to think it has anything <br />
to do with a curse placed on five witch hunters centuries ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The game is still worthless outside of Glendale. And the idea was to make Julie the pack's <br />
doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Alice was silent for a bit,  &quot;Auntie could still appeal to Julie, and once Abbey and <br />
Samantha are your daughters they will be more than willing to help us bring Aunt Julie into <br />
the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's still the very real chance she'll see through that her husband is not supposed to <br />
be a female blond she wolf twin. Not to mention your transformation of Abbey and <br />
Samantha will have nothing to do with the game directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to convince Julie to accept the game if I can prove to her that I still love <br />
her.&quot; Fran said. <br />
<br />
&quot;If she even accepts that it's you.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; The twin said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;And none of you have even addressed the fact that the game is STILL no good outside the <br />
city limits and thus Julie would have to come back here for the question to be asked of <br />
her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice said, &quot;Once Abbey and Samantha are like me, we could help bring Auntie Julie back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if the unknown witch or whatever is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be sure to look through the mirrors first father.&quot; Alice left out how the mirror would all <br />
be covered where Alice was going. She didn't want to worry her father/Master. <br />
<br />
&quot;If Abbey and Samantha lead Julie back to Glendale, she'll follow without hesitation.&quot; Fran <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what a loving mother would do.&quot; Darla added thinking of Alice had been caught by the <br />
police she'd have stormed the building herself single handed to take her back. <br />
<br />
Jesen couldn't argue against that logic. &quot;Very well.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, &quot;.... Fran, Darla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything happens to me, Kaylee is in charge until Bart comes of age in nine years. If <br />
something happens to both of us, the two of you or three of you that it happened to be at <br />
the time are to act is regent for the pack until Bart and Jenny are adults. This is my will <br />
and command. You're also to pick successors if you find yourselves in charge but not <br />
before understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla practically slammed their heads into the wooden floor, &quot;NOTHING WILL <br />
HAPPEN TO YOU MASTER! EVER! WE'LL DEFEND YOU WITH OUR LOVE AND LIVES!!!&quot; The <br />
twins swore. <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, &quot;Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... yes master...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen wasn't sure WHY he said that, or what had precisely inspired him to say that. But ... <br />
there was a deep sick feeling at the pit of his stomach, like something awful was going to <br />
happen.  It wasn't something he could precisely describe, maybe he was just being <br />
paranoid, maybe having their plans backfire at them after everything had been going so <br />
relatively smoothy had left him depressed. Whatever this feeling was, Jensen just hoped it <br />
was wrong. <br />

<br />
Earlier that day, before leaving the Perkins household Trevor had had an encounter with <br />
the last 'person' he had ever hoped to meet. <br />
<br />
Julie of course had been wondering what Trevor had been doing meowing to a cat that <br />
meowed back, in particular one he didn't seem comfortable around but who seemed very <br />
comfy around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you?! Some kind of stalker?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a cat. Does that answer your question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was making my rounds looking for some human to mooch off of when I caught you <br />
scent nothing more.&quot; Said Queen, the stray looking pleased with herself as always. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look I don't have time for your GAMES Queen! My human and I are busy gather <br />
information for something very important and that doesn't include you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... is that so... what if I happen to have information you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't even know what we're doing here or what we're looking for!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I do, maybe I don't, I hear a lot of things among the mollies I hang out with. ... I'm <br />
sure they'd like to meet you too... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get spaded.&quot; <br />
<br />
Queen turned red under her fur and hissed like a stream pipe.  &quot;You did NOT say that to <br />
ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you bet I did!&quot; He considered calling her a female dog, but he didn't want to possibly <br />
ruin the crime scene with a fight to the death. <br />
<br />
&quot;You -little-.... &quot; Queen continued to just hiss and snarls as she mentally doubled back on <br />
herself, her peach sized brain contorting over what it just heard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Little what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... &quot; Queen gather herself. Ever so slowly. The humans present merely watched in awe at <br />
the alien exchange. &quot;.... You really are something else you know?... I'm starting to think <br />
you need to mount a cat just to get your mind in the proper working order. Maybe mating <br />
is what you need to get your head on straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor didn't want to think about what Queen would consider 'head on straight' with her <br />
species-centric logic. At least with Serenity and Julie present he was able to ignore her <br />
scent for the most part. <br />
<br />
&quot;...  Go ahead... Trevor... go ahead and play detective with your human... but when her <br />
inferior brain fails you and you need some actual help... I and the mollies will be waiting <br />
for you. And the rest of the community... you can't keep pretending you're one of these <br />
inferior monkeys forever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Queen then came up to him, brushed herself against him, and left the same way she had <br />
come in (the way Trevor had of course).<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that about?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOTHING!&quot; Trevor snarled. <br />
<br />
Serenity sighed, Trevor's universe was a very lonely place....<br />
<br />
Now here was Trevor, scared out of his wits that he'd somehow lose his soul or at least <br />
the surviving aspects of his humanity. How much of himself was even left in this peach <br />
sized skull of his anyway?  He followed the scents of cats to where they congealed the <br />
greatest san the animal shelter (the idea of being neutered gave Trevor nightmares and <br />
had given him even more nightmares when he had been in the pet shop fearing the store <br />
owner would decide to go 'snip-snip' with him).    He followed he scent away from <br />
Serenity's house, it's safety, his own place he wouldn't end up ... he didn't know what.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity had insisted on the collar, least Trevor ended up being caught by the dog <br />
catcher. It reminded Trevor way way way too much of the muzzle that had been around <br />
his jaw for who knows how long, but the idea of ending up in a tiny storage cage waiting <br />
to be rescued or put to sleep scared him even more. And he didn't even have the GAME <br />
anywhere! He was just a talking cat like some magical family comedy.  What a walking joke <br />
he was... <br />
<br />
He passed by a tween age red haired girl who was sitting at a sidewalk bench with a <br />
slightly confused look on her face as she read the book in her lap. Trevor wondered what <br />
her story was but shrugged it off, he had his own problems to worry about.   He didn't <br />
want to think about what back alley, junk yard, scrap yard, used tire yard, or backyard of a <br />
senile old woman that the cats of Glendale joined up... <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Pearl still with a slamming head ache had been the one to borrow Maxine's card and had <br />
the idea of a friendly game of cards between herself, Beatrice and June.  Neither had <br />
objected. Both knew the other knew more than they were letting on. However: June hadn't <br />
told Zackery about Pearl's slip up (which Pearl had confessed to June (stupid she wolf))  and <br />
Beatrice hadn't reported to Nicole and Master. As it was, the three of them played with <br />
unspoken tension. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more than just Jack and Marcine now.&quot; Ulysses pointed out to the growing herd of <br />
deer. The two new does Ulysses had no way of knowing, were named Paltith and Caina. <br />
<br />
'Hmmm. Well, seems like someone is going to get lucky soon.' Sarah thought of Jack. <br />
&quot;Okay you holding on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then, don't get go, and here we go!&quot; And Sarah ran wild in the back yard with <br />
Ulysses on her shoulders.</p>
