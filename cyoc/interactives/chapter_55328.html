<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy was so excited by his transformation, he couldn't stop talking.  &quot;This is so cool!&quot; he kept exclaiming.  Eventually he started describing his soccer practice again to Ty, and they laughed at how impossible it would be for Jeremy to play soccer as he was now.<br />
<br />
While Jeremy continued to babble on about school and soccer practice and how cool it was to be a living bust, Ty laid back in his bed and slowly grew the muscles in Jeremy's forearms, shoulders, chest, back and stomach until they caught up with Jeremy's biceps.  Jeremy was so psyched by his bust transformation, he didn't even notice what Ty was doing until Ty started having to grow his biceps too to keep up with the rest of him!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, Ty!&quot; he exclaimed, laughing.  He pulled off his shirt and it fell to the floor in front of Ty's dresser.  Jeremy looked down at his defined chest and stomach in amazement.  &quot;Wow!  Thanks Ty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed as well.  &quot;Well, if you're gonna be a bust, you should look the part!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone at school is gonna be so surprised!&quot; said Jeremy, flexing experimentally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, especially if you're still a bust!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha!&quot; laughed Jeremy.  &quot;That would be so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how are you going to get to class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you could take me in your backpack!&quot;<br />
<br />
They laughed at the image of Ty carrying Jeremy around school, strapped to his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Ty, suddenly, &quot;want to watch some TV before bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; replied Jeremy, &quot;but aren't your parents gonna freak when we go downstai... oooooooh---&quot;  Jeremy was cut off as the skin on his pecs suddenly changed to hard, black glass.  He looked down in shock as his chest pushed out into a wide rectangular shape, a smooth plastic bezel forming around it.  After just a few moments, he had a slick-looking flat-screen monitor growing out of his torso!  He touched the smooth, flat glass that used to be his chest in amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; exclaimed Ty, grinning.  &quot;Don't smudge yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy quickly moved his hands off of his screen, laughing.  He felt around the plastic bezel, amazed that this was part of him.  When his fingers reached around the underside, one of them hit a button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh!&quot; breathed Jeremy as his screen sprang to life.  He looked down at the images coming from his chest as the speakers on the sides of his screen filled Ty's room with sound.  Eventually he looked up, past Ty, with a strange, unfocused expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; asked Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but... I can see... well, FEEL... the images on the---my screen... without even looking at it!&quot;  He recovered and focused on Ty, grinning widely.  &quot;This is so cool!  Weird, but so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned back.  &quot;Then change your channel!  This show is boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot;  Jeremy felt around under his bezel until he found the channel buttons, and giggled when he hit one and the channel changed.  &quot;That tickles!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty watched Jeremy for a while, having fun asking Jeremy to change his channel or volume instead of using a remote control.  After a little while, Jeremy figured out how to do it without pressing his buttons, but he did it anyway because it was more fun that way.<br />
<br />
Eventually Dustin, tired of moping in his room, heard the noise from Jeremy and came to see what was going on.  &quot;Ty?&quot; he asked, knocking softly.<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Ty grinned at each other.  &quot;Come in!&quot; they called back, together.<br />
<br />
Dustin walked in nervously, but he stopped dead and his jaw dropped when he saw Jeremy.  &quot;What... how...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just watching some TV, or rather some Jeremy,&quot; said Ty.  &quot;Want to join?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sat down at the end of Ty's bed and stared up at Jeremy in shock.<br />
<br />
Jeremy smiled down at Dustin.  &quot;What would you like to watch?&quot; he asked, flipping through his channels rapidly.<br />
<br />
Dustin just kept staring, his eyes widening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, change it back!&quot; called Ty, laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot;  Jeremy changed his channel back and they all watched the show Ty had been watching on Jeremy before Dustin came in.<br />
<br />
Ty and Jeremy joked back and forth about the show and the commercials, but Dustin was too shocked and scared to do anything but stare.  Not only had Ty made Dustin younger, but Ty was bigger and older-looking and cooler-looking now than Dustin had ever been, and Jeremy was also bigger and way more muscular, and on top of that had no legs and was half TV!  Dustin decided it would be safer not to get Ty angry at him if at all possible.<br />
<br />
After the show was over, Ty stretched and yawned.  Jeremy grinned and turn himself off.<br />
<br />
Dustin stood up nervously.  &quot;Uh... thanks, Ty.  Thanks... Jeremy.&quot;  He shot a nervous final glance at Ty's half-TV friend and shot out of the room.<br />
<br />
Ty and Jeremy couldn't hold it back, and laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jeremy.  &quot;He's sure different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Ty.  &quot;I think he's afraid I was going to turn him into my alarm clock!&quot;<br />
<br />
They both laughed again.  Jeremy watched in amazement as the flat-screen on his chest turned back into his defined pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you don't want your legs back?&quot; asked Ty.<br />
<br />
But Jeremy was serious about staying a bust until the next day.  &quot;No, please don't change me back, Ty!&quot; he pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Ty, smiling, &quot;then I wish for it to be comfortable for you to sleep like that, and I wish the lights were out!&quot;<br />
<br />
The room suddenly went dark, and Jeremy's muscular arms fell to his sides, resting on Ty's dresser beside his waist.  His head drooped sleepily.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned at his living-bust friend.  &quot;Good night, Jeremy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night... Ty...&quot; mumbled Jeremy, as he drifted to sleep.</p>
