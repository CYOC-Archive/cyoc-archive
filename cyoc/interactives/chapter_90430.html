<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving it much thought, Janet decided she was tired of being a nobody. Instead, she could be super popular! What better way to be popular is to be a cheerleader! And, since Janet was a little jealous, maybe she could be a busty one too! She thought long and hard about being her ideal cheerleader: a giggly personality, fit body and an extremely large chest. The amulet shined, and she was sure she would be happiest this way!<br />
<br />
As the amulet begins to glow, Janet could feel the change almost immediately! Looking into the mirror, she could see that her hair lightened in color, while her skirt and shirt followed suit, leaving her shirt pink. Her long stockings became a little shorter. What surprised her most were her breasts! They had gotten bigger! The amulet must have worked!<br />
<br />
By the time the changes continued, Janet was looking appalled by what happened next.  Apparently, her clothes were falling off! Her shirt began to shrink, with her large breasts pushing her bra underneath it. Her hair also grew longer, and turned brighter as well.  She yelped in surprise, as she didn’t see this coming.  “This was a dumb idea!” she said in a panic, “Why did my ideal Cheerleader self have to dress so...skimpy?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the changes accelerated. Her skin began to darken, looking more tanned. Her chest developed muscles, muscles required to be the best cheerleader ever! Her hair grew longer, and restyled itself, looking far more alluring than before. Her shirt, bra, skirt, and shoes all completely disappeared leaving her naked.  Feeling more embarrassed, she covered her breasts with her arms and was red in the face.  Her eyes became a staggeringly bright blue as well. As she touched her larger breasts, she felt a little aroused. She also felt...strange in her head. Thoughts of uncertainty were replaced with thoughts of, like, clothes, cheerleading practice, and BFFs. Right, her ideal cheerleader was super happy, but also kind of a ditz so...was she getting dumber?<br />
<br />
She didn’t have time in figuring that out as her body kept on changing.  Janet&#39;s hair grew out far longer, and styled itself, become long, beautiful and wavy. Her breasts had grown much bigger, though much of it was since she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. A purple and gold skirt appeared around her waist. Janet giggled. She was so silly; she had forgotten half of her uniform! “At least the guys might not mind her this way...” she said with a bit of rising spirit, “I totally look cool without a shirt on.”<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s changes continued, as her hair grew longer with two cute pigtails. It also became a bright beautiful, golden blonde, which she totally loved having! Her breasts had grown bigger, but now she found her bra, so it was totally kewl! She also tanned a little bit, making her look even sexier. Janet felt, like totally sexy now! She couldn&#39;t help but giggle in the mirror. With all of her bad, self-destructive thoughts gone (as well as knowledge and memories of her past life), she was totally happy! Now she just had to get her whole uniform on, otherwise she&#39;d be late for practice!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s cheerleader uniform was now complete! She was now wearing her cheerleader top, which had to be specially made because of her massive breasts. Her hair grew out even longer, with two long strands covering her chest. Two purple ribbons appeared in her hair. They were perfect, since they showed off the school colors too! Tee hee. Two pom poms appeared in her hands. She stroke a pose, practicing for the next game! She was, like, so excited to be a cheerleader thanks to her amulet! She had tons of fun, and all the team liked her as a good friend. She may not have been too smart, but she knew how to do one thing: Have a good time! While she may have been simple minded, she was truly happy. Janet was sure she&#39;d be happy as a giggling cheerleader!<br />
<br />
The world around her starts to alter as a new reality appeared out of the old one.  Looking back, Janet could see that she’s in a room that was strange to her, yet so familiar.  Her bed, walls, and vanity were decorated with her high school colors and banners.  She even notice on the self was multiple cheerleading trophies, emphasizing that she was a veteran in her professional.  “Wow!” she said in pure excitement, “This is, totally, what I want in an cheerleader!  Popular, sexy, and all the skills to, like, turn some heads.”<br />
<br />
The last of her memories finally altered as she remembers her new life.  That her name was actually Jessica and she had been cheerleading since she was five.  That all the years of hard work and practice made her the best out there.  Smiling to herself, she gave off a preppy giggle and was ready to take on the cheerleading world.  Looking to the amulet, she wondered what to do now?</p>
