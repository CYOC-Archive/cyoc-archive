<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If you don&#39;t want your penis catching anyone&#39;s attention, I can help you with that boy.&quot; Madame Illusia offered.<br />
&quot;No! Anything but that!&quot; Tyler screamed out in panic.<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re amenable to sharing yourself with the world? Go on.&quot; She cooed. <br />
Tyler, defeated, &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got it, and you&#39;re proud. So flaunt it for us why don&#39;t you?&quot; Madame Illusia said with a menacing smirk.<br />
<br />
Tyler paled and flushed with embarrassment, he stared at the crowd silently begging them to look away as he did a nervous little dance raising some jeers from the crowd and immediately reached for his clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ah ah.&quot; Madame Illusia tutted and Tyler froze, unable to move from his bent over position despite trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;d share yourself with everyone, let&#39;s make sure that&#39;s the case. Bring me The Analyzer!&quot; Stage hands wheeled out a contraption between the two. It was covered in bright colors and had several of those comical oversized arrows and some numbers. That was all Tyler could make out from his hunched over position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Face the crowd dear boy, and smile, you&#39;re about to be a star for the rest of your life!&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Tyler asked as he stood and smiled involuntarily.<br />
&quot;Since Tyler was rude I must do something, wouldn&#39;t you all agree?&quot; The crowd roared with enthusiasm. &quot;Tyler, place your hand in the designated area.&quot; Tyler looked at the machine and saw an outline of a hand painted on a piece of wood. There was no metal contacts or anything that implied anything should happen but the dials and indicators all moved. His positioning kept him from being able to read anything but as soon as he tried to take a look Madame Illusia snaped, &quot;Face forward Tyler, and smile!&quot; Tyler obviously complied but he must have looked comical as laughs washed over the onlookers. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Tyler is quite brave, he did volunteer to come up here, and did remember his politeness eventually. And he is being generous in sharing himself with us after all... Let&#39;s say, all in all, he&#39;s earned...&quot; the crowd was silent and still. &quot;Moderate Augmentation... No... Let&#39;s go Major for all you folks out there!&quot; The crowd erupted in cheers and hollers which she shushed after a moment. &quot;Settle down so we can get on with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She began moving pieces around on the machine and pandering to the crowd. Everyone knew what was going on but him. She would move things one way, then the other getting cheers and boo&#39;s in response, occasionally a laugh would come from a spectator or two. Tyler&#39;s cheeks were now burning from holding a smile for so long, but with each motion she made Tyler felt an odd disorientation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he&#39;s ready, what do you guys think?&quot; Giggles, cheers, and claps came from the crowd. &quot;Alright Tyler, you can turn around...&quot; the spell holding him in place and making him smile dropped, his hands immediately went to his cheeks. &quot;... and see...&quot; He turned. &quot;Your new sexuality!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tyler looked at the board and finally got to read all the &quot;Settings&quot; not that it looked like anything more than a few boards cobbled together with sliding inserts and a coat of paint.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right Tyler. You are now a man of the people. Firmly bisexual. You are no longer only attracted to looks but also personality and power, but on all of them we brought the minimum requirements down to zero. You were a little below average on the aromantic/asexual scale meaning you were happy to be alone, but from now on not having someone to share your bed will be simply unthinkable. Of course we brought your sex drive to unthinkable heights. And finally, ideal age was just 18-24... that doesn&#39;t seem very open of you, now does it? So we simply removed the maximum age all together.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tyler paused trying to wrap his head around what this actually means &quot;You&#39;re turning me into...&quot; <br />
&quot;The town bicycle, yes.&quot; cruel laughter erupted from the joke.<br />
&quot;But, I&#39;ll spend all my time, money, and energy on dates trying to have sex. My life will be ruined.&quot; Tyler gulped.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re handsome... but you&#39;re right, its not just about your preferences after all, broadening your appeal to a wider audience would make you a better bicycle after all.&quot; <br />
Tyler shook his head in horror as waves undulated throughout his body, he felt his muscles grow heavier and a pulling on his groin, he heard the crowds reactions but he was focused on his internal sensations as his bones stretched and his skin burned. Tyler was left panting a moment later as the crowd was cheering yet again.<br />
&quot;There! Do we think Tyler will have any trouble?&quot; Madame Illusia asked<br />
There was a resounding no, and a man called out, &quot;Come home with me daddy.&quot; which Tyler unexpectedly found he liked. <br />
<br />
The Analyzer was replaced with a mirror, Tyler now appeared to be a man in his mid thirties, no longer clean shaven, the beginning of white hair showed on his stubble starting at his jaw but not yet tinging his temples, his penis and balls even bigger, but nothing compared to his bodybuilder physique. He could still look normal in a hoodie, or look jacked in a t-shirt. The size and age change were noteworthy but the biggest change to his appearance had to be the dark coating of body hair removing any hint of his former youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...&quot; A deep gravely rumble had replaced his former light tenor voice. &quot;Oh my god! Is that me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets all give Tyler a big round of applause! Tyler collect your things and leave the show.&quot; Clapping began and Tyler was forced to bend down and collect his clothes. As he was walking past Madame Illusia she stopped him and whispered, &quot;No Tyler, screw you.&quot; She kissed his massive arm and a tattoo grew and wrapped itself around and down his arm.<br />
<br />
Thoroughly defeated, &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am. Thank you Ma&#39;am.&quot; was all he could think to say stepping carefully as his massive legs kept crushing and slapping his oversized testicles with each step. His clothes had morphed into basketball shorts and a t-shirt, his wallet showed his new age and his address now had a unit number in it. Despite the carbs, he stopped by one of the stalls and bought himself a beer. Sitting down to collect his thoughts he looked around and realized he wanted desperately to fuck everyone he saw and his shorts were obscenely tented.</p>
