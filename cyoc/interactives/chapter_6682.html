<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Who cares?&quot; Erika said.  &quot;Just get rid of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; agreed Mia.  &quot;Is it really that important?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is!&quot; I said.  &quot;These guys tried to rough me up.  Right?&quot; I turned to Brittany and asked.  &quot;Just rough me up?  Or worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down.  &quot;I told them just to rough you up.  But I really don't know if they would go too far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; I said, believing her.  &quot;OK, so imagine what would have happened to all of you if something worse had happened to me.  You'd be stuck with this insatiable urge for me and I wouldn't be around to quench it.  You'd be stuck like this forever.  Do any of you really want that?&quot;<br />
<br />
I let it all sink in on them.  &quot;He has a point there,&quot; Trisha said.  I was glad that she was the first to defend my viewpoint.  She looked at Erika and Claire.  &quot;You two would have been teen mothers, just like you said you hated, and without a father.  That would probably be Hell on both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded her head in agreement.  Erika still wasn't too pleased.  &quot;Well what other grand plans do you have?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought maybe I could make them into living sex toys for you all,&quot; I said.  &quot;You know, if I'm not around or if I'm busy, you guys could fuck them.&quot;<br />
<br />
To my surprise, I saw most of them shake their heads no while they mumbled back and forth.  &quot;I don't think so,&quot; Lindsey said.  &quot;I only want your cock.&quot;  Mia and Katie nodded their heads at that thought.  So, too, I thought I saw, did Erika.  &quot;And besides,&quot; Lindsey said.  &quot;I enjoyed it more when Katie, Trisha, and I went down on each other in the locker room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoyed it more than what?&quot; I asked, not sure what she meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than the other times some other guy fucked me,&quot; she said.  &quot;But not more than when you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; I said.  &quot;You'd rather have sex with a woman than with a guy other than me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; she said cheerfully.  Katie agreed with what Lindsey said.  The others, except for Trisha, didn't have a frame of reference for that.  I looked at Trisha but she had remained unreactive to what Lindsey had said.  But I wanted to know what she thought to that.  So I wished I could read her thoughts.<br />
<br />
'Well, she's right about something, for once,' Trisha's thoughts said.  'But I'm not going to have sex with anyone but Joe.'  I stared at her the whole time I was able to read her thoughts.  She was looking right back at me.  'Joe, if you're going to read my thoughts, maybe you should make it a little less obvious.'<br />
<br />
Whoa, holy shit.  She knew what I was doing!  What was it about her?  How did she know all of this?  In order to find out what she was up to, I wished that she could read my thoughts.  'We have to talk,' I said in my mind.<br />
<br />
'Obviously,' she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hello?&quot; Lindsey asked.  &quot;Are you two done looking at each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, don't worry,&quot; I said.  &quot;OK, so you'd rather have sex with another woman.  Well, here's my idea.  Let's turn these two thugs into maids/concubines.  But let's make them female.  Anyone have any objections?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Brittany said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked, not really interested in what she had to say.  &quot;You really don't have a say in this, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't going to work,&quot; she said.  &quot;They have friends who will come looking for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dear Brittany,&quot; I said.  &quot;The ring lets me alter people's perceptions of others.  It also lets me make other people think a half-cat, half-18 year old girl, and two girls who are always naked is perfectly normal.  It can surely make it so that no one will miss these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; she rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone else?&quot; I asked.  No one said anything.  &quot;OK, then, here we go.&quot;  I decided that it would be best to keep them frozen while they changed.  In fact, I knew it would be.  I wished that their clothes were gone.  They were now naked.  Then I wished that they would transform into a pair of buxom bimboish woman, with great bodies and a willingness to do only what any of us asked them to.  I wished that they would have great sex drives and want to have sex wherever, whenever.  However, I wished that they were not really bimbos in the sense of being dumb, but just of being submissive and cooperative.  I wished that they'd still have enough wits about them to act like normal people, but that their lust for sex would still dominate their thoughts.<br />
<br />
The changes started while I was still make the mental adjustments for them.  Both men, whatever their names were, had short, brown hair.  It changed to long, blonde hair.  Their waists became tiny, while their hips and ass enlarged.  It looked like they were going to have perfect hour-glass figures.  Their fingernails lengthened and turned red.  Their toenails became the same color.  Their feet and hands got smaller, their legs and arms thinner.  Their shouldes narrowed, their stomachs flattened.  The changes were happening very quickly.  Their faces reformed by twisting and contorting, leaving no trace of masculinity behind.  Their noses were smaller, lips fuller, eyelashes longer, and cheeks rounder.<br />
<br />
Their last two changes happened.  Their cocks shrank into their bodies as their testicles reformed into their new pussies.  Then their breasts grew.  They were very large, probably both in the DD range.  'Yep,' I thought, watching the changes coming to an end.  'They definitely look like bimbos.'<br />
<br />
'That's what you wanted,' I heard Trisha's thoughts.  I turned to look at her and she was just smiling at me.<br />
<br />
The changes were complete.  &quot;Let's meet them,&quot; I said.  I wished that they were unfrozen.  They both fell over.  Oops, I thought.  I had forgotten that they were lunging at me.  They picked themselves off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; one said cheefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi yourself,&quot; I said.  &quot;What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, well,&quot; the first one said.  &quot;I don't remember.  Do you?&quot; she asked her counterpart.<br />
<br />
She looked up in thought.  &quot;Nope, can't think of it.&quot;  Jeez, they sounded like bimbos.  Oh well. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK, we'll name you,&quot; I said.  I pointed to the first one.  &quot;You're Candi, and you're Tammi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I like that name,&quot; Candi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Tammi chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you two know what you're supposed to do here?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Tammi said.  &quot;Whatever any of you want us to do.  But we're really supposed to be maids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And living sex toys,&quot; Candi added.  Wow, my wish made them fully aware of their roles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any problems with that?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; they said in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, welcome to the house,&quot; I said.  By this time, something had stirred within Lindsey, Mia, and Katie.  They were all up off the couch they had occupied, eyeing Candi and Tammi.  They came closer to the, lust in all of their eyes.<br />
<br />
I looked at them with question in my eyes.  &quot;We need to test them, don't we?&quot; Mia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; I replied.  This would give me another chance to talk to Trisha.  I looked at Erika and Claire.  They seemed drawn to whatever was about to happen with the other five.  I looked at Brittany and she was just pouting.  &quot;Why don't you go join in?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;Leave me be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; I said.  &quot;Better drop that prissy attitude.&quot;  I walked on to the staircase, and Trisha followed me.  We went back upstairs to the room we had just been in.  &quot;What's the deal?&quot; I asked.</p>
