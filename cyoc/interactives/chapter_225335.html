<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James found himself leaving the office a bit later than he would have as an intern. Letting out an exhausted sigh, James felt slightly tired from his first day as CEO. Being in the office was nothing compared to the tasks he completed at the mansion. Here he had to constantly play the role of Miles in front of everyone. It was quite arduous.<br />
<br />
Luckily, it was only Thursday which meant that tomorrow was his last work day before the weekend. Hopefully, Miles had found the mole by now since it seemed that their week as each other was approaching its end.<br />
<br />
James suddenly found himself feeling a bit despondent as he realized he would have to go back to living his unglamorous lifestyle as an intern living in a decrepit apartment. Over the past few days he had grown accustomed to Miles’ luxurious life. Including the pleasure and perks that came from being in Miles’ impressive body.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Since when did I become a sybarite?” James thought to himself as he exited the building. He spotted Phillip waiting for him in his car. Miles had made it apparent in the contract that he didn’t want James to drive his cars so he arranged Phillip to be his designated driver for the week.<br />
<br />
James easily complied. He wasn’t too fond of driving such expensive cars in his new body. He wasn’t sure he could control his newfound strength and power so easily. So he definitely didn’t want to be behind the wheel of Miles’ precious cars.<br />
<br />
“Good evening sir.” Phillip said as he opened the door and let James inside the car. The car was made specifically for Miles’ stature, so James had no problem getting in. In fact, it felt nice to be constantly be in places tailored for his large size. James couldn’t even imagine how much more uncomfortable the city bus would be in this body.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Phillip.” James politely told him as he checked Miles’ work phone for any important notifications. He only simply saw a message from Vince. James ignored it and realized he would probably have to tell Miles about his hook up while in his body. But Miles could probably sympathize seeing how high the sex drive in his body was. This body simply craved sex and pleasure.<br />
<br />
As James begin to think about Miles, he began to remember his original body. Thoughts of his old cute twink body entered his mind and James soon found himself getting aroused. Attempting to prevent his larger equipment from tenting in his pants, James pushed his meaty thighs closer together.<br />
<br />
“I can understand why I’m constantly horny,” James thought, “but why do I get extra horny when imagining my original body?” <br />
<br />
James pushed the thoughts away and tried to focus on his work day. For the most part it was a successful day. He completed all his tasks and work flawlessly and pulled off his new role as Miles perfectly. It almost seemed as James was perfect at being a CEO. However, James wished he had more time to see Miles. He never realized how much of the day he never ran into him.<br />
<br />
Phillip pulled into Miles’ mansion and James found himself unlocking the door and entering. He first made a pit stop at Miles’ bedroom and left his belongings in the room. He then undressed before putting on some workout clothes Miles had in his closet. In the contract, Miles had asked James to workout in his old body to maintain his muscular physique. So for the past few days he had been working out in Miles body at his indoor gym.<br />
<br />
James made his way to the indoor gym as he tried to remember the rest of his schedule. He would have to eat dinner, take a shower, and then get ready for bed. Any work calls or tasks he received in between would also have to be completed.<br />
<br />
James entered the gym. It was large and impressive room that most pertained of weights, treadmills, and other workout equipment. Miles hadn’t asked James to do anything too intense, considering it was only a week, and only asked him to do simple cardio on the treadmill.<br />
<br />
At first James listened but found his new body felt restless from the lack of exercise. James originally started with the dumbbells before realizing Miles’ body had accustomed to exercising and easily began to move on to the weights. As if second nature, James found himself working out easily in his muscular and powerful body. Over the past few days, James had taken on a rigorous workout plan that he could only assume was what Miles regularly did. But for his new body, it was a cakewalk.<br />
<br />
After a nice long workout, Miles dried himself with a towel as he looked at his reflection on the mirror wall. His body was drenched with sweat as large stains could be seen exhibiting from under his arms… and his chest… and his back… honestly he was mostly covered in sweat. James took off his wet shirt and tossed it to the side as he dried his sweaty self.<br />
<br />
As he finished, James looked at his reflection and felt mesmerized. The hairy hunk staring back at him was incredibly attractive. But it turned him on more knowing he was the one currently in the body. James flexed his large biceps as he admired the stark contrast between his new physique and his old one.<br />
<br />
Staring at his hairy chest, James wondered if he could try something he always wanted to try. With a bit of focusing, James felt his left pec bounce followed by his right. James gave a charming smile, as he began to bounce his hairy pecs. After a bit, James left the indoor gym and made a quick stop at the special room.<br />
<br />
Phillip had clearly cleaned and tidied up the room while he was gone as James noticed there showed no signs of the intense sex he had had with Vince the night prior. Impressed, James crouched down to reach the box he found tuckered away in the closet yesterday. He opened it and breathed a sigh of relief at seeing the magic ring inside. After the close call with Vince, James thought it would probably be better to hide it somewhere more obscure, even somewhere Phillip wouldn’t be likely to find it.<br />
<br />
Storing it away, James made his way to the dining room where Phillip had his dinner already prepared. After a delectable scrumptious meal worthy of his new appetite, James returned to Miles’ bedroom to finish undressing and shower.<br />
<br />
Checking his own phone, James was relieved to see no missed calls. The whole spectacle with Vince had really stressed him out. Awakening, cleaning himself, and quickly ushering Vince out of his house felt more pressurizing with Miles’ constant phone calls. He hoped that Miles hadn’t caught on over the phone but he figured he would probably still tell him when they were in their original bodies.<br />
<br />
Just as James was about to shower…</p>
