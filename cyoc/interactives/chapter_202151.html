<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that you’ve kinda figured out what your powers are and how you could use them on every one of your family members, you decided that it was time to get serious and to make some changes. Your little brother and sister were the ones who annoyed you the most, so you felt like it was now your chance to help the siblings to “grow up” a little bit so they were a bit less annoying from now on. <br />
<br />
You quietly walked up the stairs to go to Caleb’s bedroom when you heard a serious conversation going on in there. Your mother had beaten you to the room, and Caleb didn’t sound so happy. You slipped into your own room, which was right next door to your brother’s room, so you were able to overhear the entire conversation through the thin walls separating the two rooms. <br />
<br />
 “Caleb, how could you forget that you had soccer practice this afternoon? The coach just texted me! They need you to be over there in twenty minutes!” mom shouted at your little bro. <br />
<br />
Caleb was in his bedroom sitting in front of his TV monitor playing video games, which he had been doing all morning long. He had been gaming ever since he got home early from school, and mom wasn’t happy about it at all. <br />
<br />
“I don’t wanna go to soccer practice! I hate soccer! I’m lousy at it and I’m one of the smallest guys on the team!” Caleb cried out. “I wanna stay home and play video games!”<br />
<br />
“NO! You’ve been playing video games since you got home, which was THREE HOURS AGO!” mom screamed at him. “I want you to get OUT of the house, young man! You’re NOT playing video games ALL DAY LONG!” <br />
<br />
Caleb started to cry as mom yelled at him. Just then, her cell phone chimed. She stopped shouting at your little bro, and she answered the phone. <br />
<br />
“Hello? Hey, Millie? What happened? OH NO! Are you hurt? Oh, my goodness. I’m dealing with Caleb right now. This kid wants to play video games all day and it’s driving me crazy. He’s supposed to be at soccer right now and he’s giving me a tough time. Listen, stay put and I’ll come and pick you up, okay?” mom spoke on the phone, sounding desperate. <br />
<br />
You figure this was a suitable time to step out of your room and to walk into Caleb’s room. Obviously, mom needed help, and you were the one to save the day. <br />
<br />
“Oh, James. Sweetheart. Aunt Millie just called.” Mom says to you. <br />
<br />
“Mom, what’s going on? Why are you shouting at Caleb?” you ask her. <br />
<br />
“James, can you do me a huge favor? Aunt Milly slipped and fell in her backyard, and I needed to take her to Urgent Care right away, so I got my hands full. Can you please take your little brother to soccer practice for me?” mom pleads with you. Mom hands you some money and she take Caleb’s soccer uniform out of the dresser. <br />
<br />
“I don’t wanna go!” Caleb shouts, as he’s on the verge of tears. <br />
<br />
“Caleb, you’re gonna listen to momma, okay?” you tell him. “You can’t be in the house all day long. Playing sports is good for you.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks, James. I’m gonna be at the hospital till late tonight. Please get something to eat for yourself and Caleb after he comes from soccer, okay?” mom tells you. <br />
<br />
“No problem, momma. I’ll take care of Caleb. Don’t worry. He’ll be great at soccer practice, and he’ll love being there. I promise!” you assure your mom. <br />
<br />
Mom gives you a big kiss as she grabs her purse, her keys and she runs to the garage. <br />
<br />
“It’s just you and me, champ!” you say to your little bro, who has stopped crying by now. “Put on your soccer kit! Let’s go, go, go!” <br />
<br />
Caleb obeys right away, and he immediately gets dressed in the black jersey and green shorts, the long black socks covering the shin guards and the cool, black cleats. <br />
<br />
You look at Caleb and you wonder what would happen if Caleb were seventeen instead of twelve? You think that it would be so COOL if Caleb were the athletic jock brother who was totally into sports, always too busy with practice and being in the gym or on the soccer field to be at home and annoy you all the time. That would be SO perfect!<br />
<br />
“Caleb, you’re gonna be my bigger, older seventeen-year-old soccer-jock big brother from now on, instead of that whiney, annoying little twelve-year-old. You’ll be totally dedicated to working out in the gym and playing soccer all the time, and you’ll only be home to eat, sleep, shower and study and nothing more. You won’t have time to be annoyed because you’ll be more mature and totally into sports. You’ll be like that bigger, older brother I had always wanted!” you state aloud as you looked him straight into the eyes. <br />
<br />
Just as you had said, Caleb started to change and grow right before your very eyes. He was wearing his soccer uniform, but the cool thing was, his uniform grew in proportion to his growing body as the boy changed. <br />
<br />
Caleb’s chest bulged out and his arms became far more muscular, with triceps and biceps popping out from his longer arms. His chest formed into big orbs of muscle while his torso grew longer and wider, all at once, as the boy aged by five years in a matter of seconds. His flat stomach now sported washboard abdominal muscles as he continued to grow, while his cute, boyish face became older, more serious as he matured rapidly. He had a square jawline, and his hair grew longer in the back.<br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhh….” Caleb moaned in a much deeper, baritone voice as his legs just grew MUCH longer and MUCH wider than they were before as his quads just exploded with massive cords of long, thick muscle everywhere from his waist to his knees! His quads just widened and grew until they almost seemed TOO BIG on the boy, bulging from both of his mighty legs. His calves ballooned from the back of his legs into large cantaloupes, totally covered in long, thick veins everywhere. Finally, his glutes, his hamstrings and his buttocks all grew dramatically as his backside grew into one large slab of muscle which formed a big Christmas tree when Caleb raised up his arms. Huge delts, traps and deltoids formed above the pecs and shoulders as the boy just bulged with HUGE muscles everywhere. Caleb grew into a 6-foot-6-inch-tall soccer player within just a few seconds, towering over you by four inches!<br />
<br />
“Hey, bro! I got a soccer game in a few minutes. Wanna join me for practice?” Caleb now said, in a deep, baritone voice as the older, 17-year-old, updated version of Caleb stood before you, looking down at you. <br />
<br />
“You bet, big bro!” you smile, looking up to him. “I’ll take you for some burgers, afterwards. My treat!” <br />
<br />
“It’s a deal, bro!” Caleb smiles as he grabs his gym bag with all his gear. <br />
<br />
This was a huge relief. It used to be that YOU had to carry his bag, now that he’s big, tall, and older, he’s mature enough to carry his own bag to soccer practice. <br />
<br />
You smile as the two of you walk to the soccer field located at the park across the street from your house. For the first time ever, you are not annoyed by your brother. He’s more serious and he’s NOT annoying anymore!<br />
<br />
You look around the park, searching for other people to change using your cool, new powers….</p>
