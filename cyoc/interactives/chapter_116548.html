<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It struck her that she was pretty aroused. And she was angry at herself for finding any pleasure in her current situation. It was as though her body was betraying her! A translucent thread of her own lubricant was glistening between her legs. Julia emitted a frustrated grunt and stormed out of the bathroom. She refused to let animality defeat her.<br />
<br />
Julia waddled towards her closet, intent on getting dressed for the day. She ignored the growth pains in her feet as her big toes were progressively migrated, turning them into prehensile limbs. She picked a loose summer dress as well as a bra and panties from a drawer. She pulled her panties up, avoiding to look between her legs as she was doing it. The underwear fit oddly on her ape hips, but stayed in place. Putting the bra on though was a whole other story. She reconsidered her choice and went for the largest bra she had instead of her original pick. She extended the chest straps as much as she could and fastened it; it was constricting her breath significantly, but she was too stubborn.<br />
<br />
She adjusted the shoulder straps and cups, her breasts overflowing visibly. After a few tugs, she was satisfied that her chest was somewhat presentable. She then slipped into the dress, stepping in it rather than putting it over her head so that she wouldn&#39;t have to force her way through it with her broad furry shoulders. Although the dress was originally loose, flowing smoothly as she moved, the upper part was now squeezing her torso tightly. Julia tried not to think about how grotesque she must be looking.<br />
<br />
She then went to make some tea and picked a fruit along with her cup to eat and sip in front of the computer. She had work to get done if she wanted to pay her bills this month. Typing with her simian fingers had become awkward, but manageable. She also discovered she was more comfortable when sitting cross-legged than normally. Hours went by, but she had more and more troubles focusing on her task. Her mind began to wander and she found herself procrastinating instead of coding.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, she was Googling all she could about the Ape Virus; there were many articles and testimonies about male cases, but she couldn&#39;t find anything from women who had gone through this. It was so frustrating! She did find however that there was a report of increased libido and animalistic behaviours in a significant number of infected cases regardless of the stage of contamination. Going from link to link to learn more, she inadvertently stumbled upon a porn blog dedicated to ape men.<br />
<br />
Her eyes fell upon several pictures of hairy apelike men of all sorts flexing their muscles or otherwise posing naked for the viewer. Some were tall, some were shorter, and some had tails. A few were barely recognizable as human at all. There was a great variety in penis size as well - certain men had ridiculously tiny monkey cocks, while others were quite generously endowed. Some of the images were naughtier than others.<br />
<br />
She clicked on a link and fell upon a video clip of mutual masturbation between a guy who looked like a silver back and another large dude with the colorful traits of a mandrill. Both wore only leather collars and open shirts that revealed ripped bodies covered in a smooth pelt, and they were held on a leash by a perfectly waxed and human busty blonde lady who was just as naked as them. The clip, more like a teaser really, showed her crawling on the edge of a luxury bed as they sat on the floor at her feet, their legs and dicks entangled; she then simultaneously pulled on the leashes and leaned over, and the large ape-men each took a nipple in their simian mooth to suckle, all the while stroking each other&#39;s moist member.<br />
<br />
Julia hurriedly closed the window, overwhelmed by the pervy images. She realized her panties were soaking, and she had been rocking herself on her chair, grinding her mound against her ape feet. Her breathing had become shorter; in fact, she had more and more trouble breathing. She tried to take a deep inspiration to calm down, and her bras straps snapped, releasing her constricted breasts. She pulled down the shoulder straps of her dress over her biceps and untied her bra totally, letting go of it with a frustrated grunt.<br />
<br />
Julia&#39;s chest and breasts felt sore, so she started massaging them. Unconsciously she started rocking her body and grinding her wet panties against her ape feet, her legs folded on the chair, dress pulled up in part. When she realized she was giving in to self-pleasure, she didn&#39;t have the willpower to stop herself. She was  tugging on her dark elongated nipples and pressing her breasts in her hands, each touch provoking a growly moan out of her. Her ape feet were more prehensile than a few hours earlier and she was now rubbing deftly her clitoris with a big toe (finger?) through her soaked panties, while sliding several others inside to fuck herself.<br />
<br />
She was fucking herself with her ape foot! The toe-fingers deep inside, she was thrusting against her G-spot while outside her former big toe was flicking her clitoris skillfully. Her hands were caressing her chest, squeezing her breasts as she played on and off with her long nipples. Her other foot was now gripping her desk chair tightly. She emitted several low grunts as she was approaching a climax, and suddenly it hit her and she uttered a loud guttural cry of pleasure. A rush of fluids gushed out of her pussy, overflowing her panties, sticking to the fur on her inner thighs and groin.<br />
<br />
When she came back to her senses, she felt frustrated at herself again. Why was she so weak? She had to fight this! She went to the bathroom and removed her clothes to hop in the shower, washing away her fluids - as well as several fistful of head hair that detached and went down the drain, replaced by a short mane-like fuzz. Julia stepped out of the shower and did not wipe the condensation on her mirror, a bit disgusted with herself. Once she was dry again, she struggled for a minute to put the dress back on, bra-less this time. She did not bother with the panties either.<br />
<br />
Deep within her guts, she could still feel a primal hunger for more. She needed to mate.</p>
