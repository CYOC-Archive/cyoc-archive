<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Freddy woke up to hear the sound of his mother cooking in the kitchen. Whatever she was making, it smelled good, so he decided to make his way downstairs to eat it. Upon entering, he spotted his mother flipping bacon over a pan.<br />
<br />
“Morning Freddy” his mother said as she called out to him. “I was just making myself some bacon to eat. Would you like some?”<br />
<br />
“Sure” Freddy replied. “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
His mother smiled as she finished cooking and set the strips of bacon on the plate. <br />
<br />
“This can’t be too bad, right?” his mother asked. “After all, dogs eat bacon.”<br />
<br />
Freddy frowned at this comment. <br />
<br />
“Sorry sweetie” she responded. “I forgot how you feel about it being brought up. Speaking of which, has Michael been able to come up with a cure yet?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet” Freddie replied as he dug in and ate the bacon on his plate. “Though it seems we’ve gotten better at keeping the dog under control.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve noticed. You didn’t change into a dog at all yesterday. Do you think maybe it just goes away on its own?”<br />
<br />
“I doubt it. We shouldn’t be taking chances like this. It’s only been a day.”<br />
<br />
“Right.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother took the plates from the table and set them in the sink. Upon finishing cleaning, she turned to Freddy who was still sitting at the table. <br />
<br />
“Do you think you’ll be ok if I’m out for a little bit?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, mom. I don’t know if that’s such a good idea.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just for a brief stroll. I’m just getting a bit of cabin fever and I’d like to stretch my legs. I shouldn’t be gone for more than ten minutes or so. Can you try to keep the dog in check for that time?”<br />
<br />
“I guess I could try.” <br />
<br />
Freddy’s mom started to get ready as once again a sense of dread came over him. Although he didn’t dog out the last time they left him alone, he had a bad feeling that it could happen today. Trying to push these feelings away, Freddy got up to walk upstairs before catching his mother by the door. <br />
<br />
“I’ll only be a few minutes” his mother said to him as she kissed him on the forehead. “I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Ok mom.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother nodded as she walked out the door, leaving him standing there alone. As he made his way up to his room, the bad feelings he had been having had intensified strongly. When he got to his room, he wasn’t quite sure what was causing them to be so intense. As he looked out the window, he could see the problem right there by where the new fence stood. Ellie was already pacing back and forth trying to find weaknesses in the new structure. What made this worse was that Freddy had left the window open and the scent of her heat was wafting into his room.<br />
<br />
“Oh god!” Freddy thought to himself as he shut the window. <br />
<br />
Freddy started to panic as he felt a stirring in his loins. <br />
<br />
“I can’t stay here or I’m going to dog out again. I’ve got to get out of here.”<br />
<br />
Knowing that his mother would be home any minute, but not wanting to take a chance on losing his humanity in the waft of Ellie’s scene permeating his room, he decided to chance it and made his way out the front door. Quickly shutting it behind him, he could hear Ellie attempting to race to the front as she barked at him. Panicking, Freddy started to run away as he sought to escape the torture chamber that was his own home. <br />
<br />
After running for a few blocks, he caught his breath, only to discover his big mistake. <br />
<br />
“Great!” Freddy thought to himself. “Not only have I disobeyed my parents orders by leaving the house by myself, I’ve only exposed myself to more triggers by being out here with no place to escape. At least if I’d had turned into a dog there, I would have been safe in my own home and could have licked my dick back to normal. Now, I’m vulnerable. Great going, Freddy!” <br />
<br />
Freddy was about to turn around to chance it by heading back home when he noticed Sofya’s house in the distance. Gone were the moving trucks and large army of men moving furniture. Instead, it laid forth the house, looking slightly better than Freddy had remembered it. He knew it wasn’t a good idea to go see Sofya by himself. He knew that his feelings for her could trigger another transformation and to a relative stranger who might not take it well…or worse, lead him to trouble with her father, who might be the dreaded wizard. <br />
<br />
Knowing he shouldn’t be doing it, Freddy went against his better judgement and proceeded to walk up to the front steps of the old house. His rational mind begged him not to ring the doorbell, but his impulses were too strong and he did it anyway. Sensing the dread that had come over him, Freddy’s worrying was short lived as the door opened to Sofya, wearing a beautiful dress that almost looked like lingerie. <br />
<br />
“Oh, hello Freddy” Sofya said, looking slightly sleepy with unkempt hair and no makeup. “I wasn’t expecting to have you over so early, but I suppose it shouldn’t be a problem as my dad isn’t home right now. Would you like to come in?”<br />
<br />
Freddy quietly nodded as he stepped into Sofya’s house. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this. He could hear his boyfriend’s voice in his head yelling at him to turn around and go home. He didn’t follow this advice. Instead, he proceeded to look from her entryway and into the living room. <br />
<br />
It looked like what you would expect a decrepit old house to look like. Worn, faded with peeled wallpaper and the smell of dust in the air. What fascinated Freddy was all of the antiques hanging on the walls and set in various parts of the house. <br />
<br />
“That was fast” Freddy thought to himself as he stepped inside on Sofya’s urging.<br />
<br />
“Would you like me to give you a tour?” Sofya asked. <br />
<br />
“Sure” Freddy replied, feeling too fluttery inside to say more than that. <br />
<br />
Freddy didn’t remember much of the tour of the house or what Sofya had said to him. All he could recall were the stuffy old items that he saw in various parts of the house and Sofya’s bedroom, which was adorned in pink and purple. After she showed him around, Sofya invited him to sit on an antique sofa in the living room. After she brought them some water to drink, the two began to have a conversation. <br />
<br />
“So” Sofya began “I’m looking forward to starting school with you tomorrow. Is the high school ok?”<br />
<br />
“I guess” Freddy responded. “I mean, I have a lot of friends and I get along quite well.”<br />
<br />
“Do you take any after school activities?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m on the track and field team.”<br />
<br />
“That’s cool. Does Michael do anything?”<br />
<br />
“Not really. Most of the time, if we aren’t together, he hangs out with his friends who can be kinda nerdy. I guess they like to do computer things and stuff.”<br />
<br />
“That’s interesting. Speaking of Michael…”<br />
<br />
Sofya began to shift closer to Freddy, making him feel slightly uncomfortable with her closeness to him.<br />
<br />
“What’s the deal with you two anyway?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I know you say he’s your ‘boyfriend’ and all….”<br />
<br />
“Why the air quotes, Sofya?”<br />
<br />
“Well, because you two don’t seem to get it on so well.”<br />
<br />
Freddy became confused as to what Sofya might be suggesting. <br />
<br />
“You two looked like you were about to have a quarrel right there on the spot, yesterday. He kept nudging you and giving you dirty looks. Is that how a boyfriend is supposed to treat their partner.”<br />
<br />
“It’s complicated.” <br />
<br />
Freddy didn’t want to reveal to Sofya the extent of his relationship problems. Not only would doing so expose too much to a stranger who might be the wizard’s daughter, but because, quite frankly, it was none of her business. Still, she pressed on.<br />
<br />
“You’re such a nice guy, Freddy…”<br />
<br />
Sofya began to run her fingers through his hair. Although he should have pushed her away, he didn’t; something he knew innately was a big mistake. <br />
<br />
“…you don’t deserve to have to deal with someone who treats you so badly.”<br />
<br />
“In fairness, Sofya, I’m not always the best boyfriend to Michael as I should be.”<br />
<br />
“I would beg to differ.”<br />
<br />
Sofya began to lean into Freddy as she looked to kiss him. Freddy tried to hold her back, but due to a combination of an unknown allure, along with a physical strength he found overpowering, he couldn’t resist. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Freddy, don’t you think you deserve better? Don’t you think you deserve a girl who will treat you better? A girl who will appreciate your love and affection? A girl like me?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t like girls, Sofya.”<br />
<br />
“I could change your mind.”<br />
<br />
Sofya began to kiss Freddy. Although he tried to resist, his defenses were weakening as she got more and more persistent. She grabbed his hand to place it at her bosom. <br />
<br />
“Feel my breast, Freddy. Feel what a woman can give you.”<br />
<br />
Although Sofya had forcibly placed his hand on her breast, she had no part in his desire to shift his hand under her dress and begin playing with her nipple.<br />
<br />
“That’s it. Who’s a good boy.”<br />
<br />
Sofya made a big mistake in uttering those words as Freddy began to feel his loins acting up again. He started to panic as he could feel an erection in his pants. <br />
<br />
“See, I told you, Freddy. I knew you could get hard for me.”<br />
<br />
If only Sofya could see that under Freddy’s pants was no longer a human dick that wanted her, but a dog’s sheath with an exposed red penis. Freddy felt his skin start to tingle as fur began to creep up his stomach. If he didn’t get off of her soon, he’d be dogging out in her presence. Fortunately for Freddy, the two of them heard the door slam open to see…</p>
