<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“My love why would you say all that?”<br />
Michael Proudhoof asking as he appears on a computer monitor in Denise’s Washington hotel room; she returned to the suite after her grueling day of answering questions from various reporters and politicians as they tried to pull her aside for a quote or a quick chat as she tried to leave the White House. She knew she would have to defend her actions, but the anthro tigress fury was hoping to have a few hours of rest and a quiet meal or two before the inevitable onslaught of questioning. Clearly she was wrong.<br />
“Your admission to committing what some are calling bio-terrorism is running rampant on every t.v channel over here,” Michael groaning; “our town is going to become a madhouse.”<br />
 <br />
“At least they will have a good place to eat when they are done trying to badger everyone with their inane questioning,” Denise lounging on the king size bed. Her laptop pointed towards her so her mate could get a good view of her ample fury breasts and feline slit. A slit already aching for her mate’s cervine rod, to penetrate and stimulate her further.<br />
“And I doubt anyone in town will help shed further light as to what I did,” Denise already cupping a breast while playfully stroking her entrance; “and I can’t wait to get back home. I intend to grind you into a puddle of orgasmic oblivion.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Not all the crazies wound up in Wyoming,” Michael groaning as he strokes his shaft in full view of his computer web camera. Not being the most technically literate, he had to ask Jimmy to help set up the skype channel so he and Denise could chat paws free and not with cellphones.<br />
“Some of them are hiding out here in the Pacific Northwest,” Michael panting as he starts stroking faster; “they may be slow on realizing we are superior to them in every way.” Michael now moaning louder; “but they are not stupid. They will figure out where we live and try to target you,” Michael grimacing before he shudders as his shaft begins spurting his creamy seed. “Or by going after those you care for if they can&#39;t reach you directly,” Michael finishing as he catches his breath.<br />
<br />
“And here I thought you would last longer,” Denise sniggering as she watches her mate’s rapid climaxing over the video feed; plunging her fingers deep into her tunnel, she grimaces as she too soon shudders in her own relief. “As for those crazies,” Denise taking her fury fingers now soaked in her juices and licking them clean; “I wouldn’t worry about them too much. The Fury Flu mutated the viruses that give us our cold and flu seasons. If they come down with the new cold or flu,” Denise satisfied with the taste of her honey; “then they will become us.”<br />
“So we just sneeze on them if they come to town with guns a blazing,” Michael taking a paper towel to clean up his mess; “before or after they start shooting?”<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in a small gated enclave in Wyoming, several human’s each sporting a mixture of badges and patches. Some signifying a motorcycle gang, others that of a militia; several others sporting Aryan Nation tattoos, ranging from swastikas, iron crosses and death head’s sat in a community center. A member of the ragtag group of desperate, hate filled bigots shot the t.v they were all watching with a 357 magnum. The loud booming sound of the gun broke everyone out of their stunned silence after watching the same news feed’s Michael Proudhoof mention; retelling Denise’s bombshell admission to creating the fury flu.<br />
“I don’t know about the rest of you,” the man with the still smoking gun standing up; spitting out the tobacco he was chewing as he holstered his massive sidearm. “But now that I know the face of my enemy, it’s only fair we should go on a hunting expedition.”<br />
“And how the hell do you intend to hunt down this animal bitch,” a greasy looking biker grunting; “she is in Washington. A place that is full of their ilk.”<br />
“It’s a very long ride from here to our nation’s capital,” a heavily tattooed man chortling in return; “a large convoy of us heading out will surely make these freaks take notice.”<br />
“It was a hell of a journey for us to make it here,” Another chiming; “after these beasts took out Reverend Simon and the Vicksburg Militia.”<br />
“We barely made it here in one piece,” another militia survivor shouting.<br />
<br />
BANG<br />
<br />
The same man fired another round silencing the din forcing his fellow human’s to stop their grumbling as he waited for their undivided attention.<br />
“We don’t go to Washington D.C,” the man glaring; “we go to where she lays her head for sleep. We still have access to the internet. Access to television and all other forms of media. We use it ferret out all information we can about this Proudhoof bint, and then we go hunting,” the man adding with an air of authority.<br />
“Your proposing a suicide mission,” the greasy biker from before getting up to confront the self-styled alpha male; “not everyone here is eager to go down dying for a foolish cause.”<br />
“Is that so,” the man pointing his gun at the man and pulling the trigger. A third shot rings out and the greasy biker crumples to the ground in agony as the copper jacketed lead slug tears through his chest; blowing out through his back and barely missing another person who has so far kept his mouth shut. The man watched as the biker drew his last breath before looking at the crowd of disenfranchised and bitter individuals before speaking; “is anyone else here eager to take fatso&#39;s side?”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back in the White House in the presidential apartment; the female otter fury who was once the vice president, but soon became the new president during the chaotic events of the fury flu was busying getting fucked both orally and vaginally. Taking her from behind was the water moccasin fury named Dick; the Republican Senator form Tennessee. The fury she was giving head to was an ox fury who was the democratic congressman of Maine. She was once married, but when the fury flu hit her husband during the chaos, a secret service agent who was trying to escort her to safety shot him dead; but not before he scratched both her and the same agent. She became an otter fury a few hours later as she was getting sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.<br />
<br />
Now she was finding herself enjoying her new found sexual appetites as she looked at all adult furies, regardless of gender as willing and eager sexual partners. It was these new appetites that got members of both political parties to start genuinely working together as they discovered that being, heterosexual, homosexual, pansexual and other forms of intimate companionship meaningless. All that mattered was the euphoric release of endorphins between the willing partners as they contorted in a state of carnal bliss.<br />
<br />
The madam president squirmed as she felt the water moccasin fury cum inside her just as the ox fury deep throated her and spilled his seed down her gullet; forcing her gag and sigh as she was filled up in both ends.<br />
“It’s a pity Denise didn’t stay,” Dick finally pulling out; his serpentine like phallus slowly slipping back into his cloaca like vent; “do you think she suspects that we set her up to take the job as director?”<br />
“You played your part in making veiled threats. Pretending to use her for your own political ambitions” the president lying on her bed; spread eagle as the ox fury started giving her Cunnilingus, drinking up both her’s and dick’s combined juices. “She believed she was going to be dragged through the mud with senate hearings.”<br />
“To be honest,” Dick reaching for the water by the night stand; “it wasn’t a threat. Many members of congress want answers as to how the pandemic came about.”<br />
“And they have them,” The ox fury speaking before going back to his ministrations.<br />
“Yes Charles,” the president nodding at his comment; “but none of us suspected she would drop that big of a bomb today.”<br />
<br />
Dick nodded as he sipped the water. Recalling the outburst that every reporter made when Denise Proudhoof announced that she designed and released the fury virus into the atmosphere using weather balloons. Surprised at how the anthro tigress fury quickly went scorched earth with the press conference, it was almost as if she was trying to get out being the new director of the CDC by having public opinion on her appointment turn south. Having to think fast he arraigned to have his dossier full of information regarding reports of measles on the rise. It was information that would soon be revealed to the new director; but they wanted her to sweat out the first few weeks of her post, before informing her of these mutations. Now they had to scramble as Denise was planning on continuing her bombing campaign by doing interviews and more press conferences, but without their ability to control what information gets released.<br />
<br />
 <br />
“The part of cold and flu season turning the rest of humanity into furies was unexpected,” Dick putting down the water as he felt his member peeking out of its protective home; “how long do you think those nutters in Wyoming decide to try and target Denise before they start turning?”<br />
“The national guard just needs to keep them contained,” The president shuddering as the tongue from the ox fury reaches deep into her folds and brushes up against one of her sensitive spots. “Oh please do that again Charles,” the otter fury squirming with delight.<br />
“While he is keeping you content below,” Dick crawling above the president; “how about you stick your tongue up my rectum as I give you a reverse titty fuck.<br />
“Well that is a novel notion,” the president running one of her fury hand paws up and down the reptilian shaft leaking pre; “but how about you give me a show and probe Charles. I believe it’s your turn to engage in back door politics with him this time,” the president giving a sly chuckle. “Afterwards,” the president smiling as she watches Dick quickly move to be on top of Charles; “we need to plan our first meeting with the new Iranian President. To think that Theocratic government underwent the most radical transformation after the pandemic; and elected a female as their first fury leader.”</p>
