<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake from a nice, dreamless sleep to the feel of your brother&#39;s cheek and hand pressed into your chest. His skin is so warm, and soft as a girl. That feminine figure was so perfect, but it&#39;s too bad sh... er... he&#39;s a boy and your blood related little brother, and you had to sneak away from Mom and Dad to consummate your relationship.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re three years older than him: you&#39;re 18, he&#39;s 15. You fell in love with him two years ago, when you saw him in a one-piece bathing suit and realized your baby brother wasn&#39;t a string bean anymore. You&#39;ve spent endless nights up in your room, pulling your pud and pretending your exquisite baby brother was beneath you. But you never thought it would come true.<br />
<br />
Not until eight months ago, when you and him had the house to yourselves for an evening. You&#39;d settled in for an evening of TV while Mom and Dad were out celebrating their wedding anniversary. You thought he was up in his room, playing &#39;Call of Duty&#39; with his friends, until he swayed down the stairs in naked. You couldn&#39;t tell if he almost had a feminine figure, but the thrust of his nipples made it plain and his little friend between his legs is small.<br />
<br />
Then he sat down on the couch next to you.<br />
<br />
You tried to focus on the TV, but he reached a hand up and began to stroke your hair. He had turned 14 six months earlier, but you&#39;d tried to force that out of your mind. But you couldn&#39;t ignore he touching you and stroking your hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teach me how to kiss, big bro.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Your eyes went wide, and you couldn&#39;t speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to know how&quot; he went on. &quot;A boy needs to know how to kiss in this modern world, but I want to learn with someone I trust and care about.&quot; he poked you on the nose flirtatiously. &quot;And that&#39;s you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You finally managed to find your voice. &quot;But you&#39;re a boy and my little brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re my brother,&quot; he said with a nod. &quot;If a boy can&#39;t trust his brother, who can he trust?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to find yourself a girlfriend for that, or a boyfriend.&quot; you said, though you wished you had the strength to just grab his with both hands and plant one on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too young, there&#39;s time for that.&quot; he whispered. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for a girlfriend or a boyfriend, I just want to learn how to kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he leaned over you, and planted his lips on your mouth. Your ethics crumbled at that moment, and you reached one hand up to hold his head in place as you opened his lips and kissed back.<br />
<br />
He had been unwilling to go beyond kissing at first, even though you&#39;d begged. He&#39;d said he didn&#39;t want to risk getting caught by your parent. But every time you two had the house alone after that, you practiced kissing together.<br />
<br />
After you&#39;d been practicing for two months, he came into your room late one night. You slept in a pair of sweat pants and nothing else, and when you saw his body in his underwear, you couldn&#39;t hide your hard-on from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gather you like what you see.&quot; he said, and grinned. &quot;Completely and totally,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready to go to the next level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat down next to you on your bed and put a hand on your chest. &quot;I want to make out. I want to get physical. Do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;d been dreaming of when he&#39;d let you do more, but you&#39;d been scared that, if you asked, you&#39;d frighten him off. &quot;I do,&quot; you said. &quot;I want it more than you can know.&quot;<br />
<br />
He put one finger on your lips. &quot;Understand,&quot; he&#39;d said. &quot;But I&#39;m not offering you sex, not yet. Both of us will keep our panties on. But I wanna feel your hands on my body. It&#39;s all I&#39;ve been able to think of for weeks. My grades have been slipping at school because I can&#39;t think about anything but you. Please, be here for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; you said, as you reached one hand up and slipped his neck and pulled him to you.<br />
<br />
After months of kissing, it felt so good so see him take off his t-shirt for you. He kept his panties on, but he grabbed both your wrists and placed your hands on his chest. He was still only 14, but his body was so amazing, and as you stroked his shoulders and cupped his backside and kissed and stroked and made out with his and learned the feel of every inch of his body, he was like every inch girl for you.<br />
<br />
Before long, you&#39;d given up on girls at school, because the prettiest boy in the world came into your room every night and made out for hours. He never let you go all the way, and you ended most nights jerking it down after he left, but the sacrifice was more than worth it.<br />
<br />
Then, the night of his 15th birthday party, he&#39;d slunk into your room just when you expected, but just leaned against the door, looking sweet and shy and demure. &quot;I need to change the arrangement again,&quot; he&#39;d whispered so softly that you could barely hear him. &quot;I&#39;m not ready to give you my virginity yet, but I need to know what it feels like. Keep your sweats on, but make it like we&#39;re... like we&#39;re... you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grinned at him, amused and enchanted by him inability to say it. &quot;You want me to dry hump you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He only nodded.<br />
<br />
You were both virgins, and you still never got to see him with his panties off, but you and he became lovers. You learned what pleased each other. You learned to use your mouth to bring him to orgasm. You became more and more him, and he became yours.<br />
<br />
You two planned this trip together when you agreed you were both ready to lose your virginity. You&#39;d been lovers for months now. Neither of you had ever been with anyone else, and you were ready to become one together. It&#39;s finally happened. And it was everything you ever dreamed of.<br />
<br />
Your brother stirs, and flexes his fingers over your chest. That feels so good. His eyes float open, and he turns to look up at you. &quot;Good morning, big brother,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, my little brother.&quot; you say.</p>
