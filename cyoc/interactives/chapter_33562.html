<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for the long chapter, the ideas just kept coming...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few months later...<br />
<br />
Riley had been using Formula 4 every weekend for quite some time now, just to unwind after stressful weeks. The scientists didn't seem interested in finding their lost experiment, since its short term effect was considered a failure.<br />
<br />
What Riley didn't know about the formula was that it was only meant to be used once a week, as over use could cause unknown side effects. (Unknown due to lack of experimentation, but unknown none the less.) But Riley been using it twice a week, once on every Saturday and Sunday, for over a month, and the effects were starting to catch up to her.<br />
<br />
At first, the effects were quite minor. Her height had dimished about two inches and her breasts had shrunk a little, but it wasn't something anyone noticed. However, in the past month and a half, things started getting worse. Riley had several accidents, starting with wetting her bed once or twice a week, then escalated to almost night, even when she didn't drink anything for hours before going to bed.<br />
<br />
What accelerated the problem was in fact another side effect of the drug: a very minor mental change. Basically, after a month or so of using Formula 4, as well as managing to diaper herself while changing into a baby so as to not wet on her floor, Riley had bought some teen diapers to wear on occasion. With her increase in bed wettings, she had taken to wearing the diapers every night. This served to not only make Riley attached to wearing diapers, but also to further wittle away at her remaining potty training.<br />
<br />
In fact, Riley had started having day wetting problems and had begun wearing diapers full time. Again, this helped to dimish her potty training.<br />
<br />
However, with all these changes and over use of Formula 4, Riley's mind was mostly unchanged. She still thought about boys like most girls her age, as well as occasionally thinking about girls, being at the age where she was a bit bi-curious. (Though the desire to suck on women's breasts was new and possibly the only change of its kind in Riley.) She also kept the same fashion sense she had before, though it had originally altered a bit to hide her diaper, she eventually grew comfortable with them and doesn't mind if anyone finds out, not that she would tell people outright... yet. Riley had no desire for bottles, bibs, onsies and the like, but when it came to diapers, Riley thought of them similar to how she thought of thongs: Not the most popular underwear choice, but perfectly normally. (She didn't consider diapers 'sexy' like she did thongs, though.)<br />
<br />
This leads up to Riley's current (perceived) problem: Toilet training is not like riding a bike, and she did, eventually, forget. Entirely forgot, in fact. Riley was back to messing herself quite regularly. (Every couple of days.) Now, if Riley wanted to give up diapers, she'd need potty training all over again. (Good thing she likes her diapers, huh?)<br />
<br />
Of course, with wetting herself so frequently, people eventually found out. Oddly, few people thought less of her, and most of her friends still liked her. In fact, two of her friends, Amber and Cori (both girls), had told Riley that they, too, liked diapers, and the three began hanging out much more frequently. And that is what led up to where Riley is now...<br />
<br />
Right now...<br />
<br />
Riley, laying on the floor, grunted loudly as her bowels forced a heavy load into her waiting disposable diaper. She panted, sitting back up and looking at her friends, still sitting around the Monopoly game board.<br />
<br />
"Wow!" Cori, the tiny (5'0", 86 lbs.) college freshman girl exclaimed, "You really don't have any control, Riley!" Silently, Cori wished she was as brave as her friend, looking down at her own disposable diaper.<br />
<br />
"Nope, I guess not." The now quite stinky girl giggled, "But it's just so freeing not to have to worry about it."<br />
<br />
"So you don't regret being incontinent at all?" Amber asked in a level voice. She was the designated 'mother' of the other girls, being responsible for changing their diapers and buying groceries and things, now that the girls lived together. Amber was a tall, busty (D to DD), curvy woman that loved taking care of her diaper loving girls and, on a rarer than desired occasion, having sex with Cori, her girlfriend. While she loves the way the other girls look, and wears a diaper herself on occasion, her enjoyment comes from making others happy and not the diapers themselves.<br />
<br />
Riley shook her head, while cheerfully announcing, "Nope! Having to get up to go the bathroom is silly." All three girls giggled.<br />
<br />
"Well, lets get you changed." Amber stood up and led Riley to her room for a change, leaving Cori alone.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the empty room, Cori sighed. She's like Riley in that she doesn't want to be a baby (Though she knows about Riley's use of Formula 4 to find her passion), she just likes wearing diapers. But Cori is very shy, so she has a hard time using her diapers. This has actually led to Amber trying to force Cori into using her diapers, such as tying Cori down and forcing her to drink large amounts of water, but this only caused the freshman pain so Amber didn't have the heart to continue it.<br />
<br />
Focusing, Cori tried forcing herself to wet her diaper, but just couldn't do it. Pulling her knees up to her chin, Cori whimpered, wanting to be brave like Riley...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Riley and Amber were planning ways to get Cori to loosen up. Could they use the formula to help her become incontinent? Could they sedate her, numbing her enough so she wets herself? Or should they try to Cori more outgoing?</p>
