<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unsurprisingly, there were a lot of WSA students who were wanting to try out the Physical Education Building. Most high school students would dread gyms, but since the Animalian Virus improved the physiques of those who caught it, exercising has been more fun than ever. In fact, there were more than a few Animalians who equated exercise with play.<br />
<br />
Mike wouldn&#39;t have expected going to a new high school would have been something to look forward to, but he was liking the new school quite a lot. Unsurprisingly, he and Mary were using their free hour to check out the swimming pool. Of course, they weren&#39;t the only ones. Mike and Mary made a game of weaving around some of the other swimmers, with the agility one would expect from an otter in the water.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the two of them surfaced and Mike said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s not the lagoon at Mieni Atoll, but at least we don&#39;t have to wash the salt out of our fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we just need to wash out the chlorine,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we better do that now if we&#39;re gonna make it back to class on time,&quot; said Mike as he climbed out of the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got over half an hour,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not just going to wash off in the shower,&quot; said Mike, grinning at Mary. Mary grinned and quickly got out of the pool to follow him.<br />
<br />
One of the most interesting new features of the school was the co-ed locker rooms. Mike couldn&#39;t figure out what the point of having those locker rooms would be except for sex...until he found out that <i>was</i> the point. Unlike nearly every high school, WSA acknowledged that the students were hormone-driven young adults and the chances were high that they&#39;ve already had sex. So for all the bondmates who were dealing with heat and rut, the school had built brick corridors with shower heads and special obscuring curtains for them to blow off some steam, with contraceptive drug dispensers/vending machines for to prevent teen pregnancy. Already, it was becoming a tradition for a couple to have sex in one of the showers and then write their names on one of the bricks on the wall with a waterproof marker. This minor vandalism was allowed, though the names will be washed off with acid at the end of the school year.<br />
<br />
As Matt and Mary walked into the locker room, they saw someone else there. Zoe was going through her locker, wearing little more than a sports bra and gym shorts. She spotted the two otters and asked, &quot;You two going to put your names on the wall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, what did I say about saying that stuff out loud?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t mind me,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;To be honest, I&#39;m a little jealous of you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? Don&#39;t you have a mate?&quot; asked Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I&#39;ve been thinking about it,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a heat thing or not, but I&#39;ve been thinking more and more of finding a mate lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could just be hormones,&quot; said Mike, &quot;We may be double-dosed, but we&#39;re still teenagers. A lot of us are boy/girl crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; said Zoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you think you&#39;re going to look for a mate from the lion pride? I think there may be a few guys who might still be single. But I wouldn&#39;t know personally,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve thought about that,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;But I&#39;m also considering of converting a boy who would be interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to be careful with that,&quot; said Mike, &quot;I would imagine a lot of guys would like to take advantage of that just so they could become lions. You&#39;d want someone to like you for who you are, not for what you can change them into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;But I figure I ought to have some good chances. Well, I better hit the weights. This figure won&#39;t stay this way without maintenance.&quot; With that, the anthro lioness walked off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope she finds someone who&#39;d make a good mate,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes me appreciate how much I have you,&quot; said Mike, hugging Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you,&quot; said Mary before kissing Mike deeply. Before long, she felt a familiar poking at her waist. &quot;So, are we going to hit the shower?&quot; she asked in a breathy tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Mike before they headed towards the heavy curtain, stopping to grab a contraceptive pill on the way.<br />
<br />
Walking past the curtain, they could see that there were already some names on the bricks, including some notable couples. A waterproof marker had been left by someone next to the shampoo and conditioner. Wasting no more time, the otters turned one of the shower heads and peeled off their swimsuits. Mike could never get enough of watching Mary reveal her curvy body. Her nipples were already erect, not that her short fur did much to hide it. And Mike couldn&#39;t help but feel a little proud when his dick was fully erect.<br />
<br />
Mike and Mary made out some more under the falling water, Mike slowly pushing Mary back until she was against the wall. His dick prodded her a few times before finding her pussy and sinking in. Both of them moaned as Mike started thrusting into her. Mary moaned louder as he felt her breasts all over before licking the nipple of one. Mike&#39;s thrusting became more vigorous as his teasing of Mary&#39;s breasts made her more excited. Pretty soon, they both let out a short cry, thankfully muffled by the brick walls and the heavy curtains.<br />
<br />
The two otters panted for a while before Mike pulled out of Mary. The falling water was already washing off their groins. &quot;We better get cleaned up before our free hour&#39;s up,&quot; said Mike. The shampoo and conditioner took a while to lather on, but it cleaned their fur well enough.<br />
<br />
Once they were done, they took the marker and wrote on one of the bricks &#39;Matt + Mary&#39;. Mary looked at the other signed bricks and said, &quot;I wonder how many couples will be on the wall before the year&#39;s over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to say, but there&#39;s a lot of bricks to cover,&quot; said Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those bricks will have a lot of stories to tell before the year is over, that&#39;s for sure,&quot; said Mary. But then the two otters had to move on before they were late for class.</p>
