<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Moms are home,&quot; Ben stirring from the slumber he was enjoying; yawning as he stretched, Ben looked at Alex as his werewolf lover also stirred. Smiling as he was spooning Alex; electing to be the one who gives instead of receiving during their past session of rutting. Ben allows Alex to disentangle himself from the embrace he was in; both sitting up in bed and giving each other a loving lick on the muzzle.<br />
&quot;The sooner you hash things out with your moms,&quot; Alex commenting; &quot;the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
******** <br />
<br />
Marcus Huntington, a doctor and a were-rat. A man Frances Twist loathes because of his shady treatments that blur the line between treating a patient and medical experimenting. Frances could not believe the doctor is still employed at Moon lake General Hospital and that he was treating her mother. Despite Tora Tachibana’s assurances that Doctor Huntington will be closely observed as he helps Angelica Carter; Frances could not help but hiss in anger at the mere mention of his name.<br />
<br />
While the treatment for Angelica’s cancer was sound on paper; Frances still shook her head in dismay. To her targeted gene therapy was still the realm of science fiction; despite that this treatment helped saved thousands of lives already and is now a proven medical practice. Thanking Doctor Tora for emailing the article regarding the procedure Angelica will be undergoing for her Pancreatic Cancer; Frances was so lost in reading it when a cough could be heard. <br />
<br />
Looking up Frances could see Ben and Alex at the kitchen door; both in their werewolf fursona and quietly waiting. The cough came from Samantha as she was busy making a beef and broccoli stir fry. The smell of meat cooking on stove was an inviting aroma for two hungry teenage werewolves. However, neither dared to walk into the kitchen as Samantha had a cold look on her face.<br />
<br />
“Alex,” Frances looking at Ben’s lover; “why don’t you hang out in the living room and keep my brother company. Samantha and I need to have a talk with Ben.<br />
“Sit down,” Samantha looking at Ben; her tone making it clear it was not a request.<br />
<br />
Ben sighing as Alex knew better than to rile up an angry were-cat; despite being stronger, Alex complied as Ben reluctantly did as requested.<br />
“Before either of you pick up where you left off last night,” France’s putting her laptop away; “you are going to listen to me.”<br />
“Make it quick,” Samantha glares at Ben; “unless you want the beef to burn.”<br />
“You both said some regrettable things last night,” Frances looking serious; “do not try to deny that. Ben,” Frances addressing the werewolf; “what Samantha did was for the safety of the town. Ordering Grrrrrrr to shut down while Frederick Parker is in town was a necessary decision. The fact that it cost you the job you landed there is not lost on either of us.”<br />
“It seemed to mom,” Ben huffing; “she knew I was filling out forms finalizing my employment over there.”<br />
“Let me finish,” Frances cutting Ben off; “as mayor, Samantha must put the needs of the town first. While you are understandably upset; your mother didn’t do this to spite you.”<br />
<br />
Frances let what she said sink in for a few minutes; watching Samantha flipping the beef so it doesn’t bur before speaking again.<br />
“Samantha,” Frances placing a hand on the head of a tiny kitten that just jumped on her lap; “I understand you are under a lot of stress with the job as mayor. But you shouldn’t vent your frustrations or anger out on Ben. He was understandably upset when he lost his job before he could collect his first paycheck. You owe our son an apology for what you said last night.”<br />
“Ben owes me one as well,” Samantha grumbling.<br />
“I agree on that,” Frances answering; “so both of you better get this off your chest. No more letting this fester.”<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Samson was sitting in the living room watching t.v; he could not help but chuckle as he heard everything Frances said. Sitting quietly as Alex joined him; watching the werewolf grab a package of beef jerky from a hiding place behind a bunch of DVD’s.<br />
‘Ben changed up where he hid his treats,’ Samson thinking to himself.<br />
“My sister certainly has a way with words,” Samson speaking as Alex flops on the couch; digging out a strip of cured meat and tossing it into his maw.<br />
“Part and parcel with being a therapist,” Alex shrugging his furry shoulders; looking at Samson and seeing the man in a sling, Alex was about to ask when Samson spoke up.<br />
“I got shot this morning while trying to apprehend a dangerous man,” Samson motioning the bandage on his shoulder; “the man is dead and Frederick Parker by now was told he was harboring a wanted war criminal.”<br />
“What,” Alex holding onto another strip of beef; pausing from consuming it as well.<br />
“It’s not important,” Samson listening to his sister still speaking; “bit if you don’t want Frances to know about Ben’s latest hiding spot, you’ll pass that jerky over here.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Now that is over with,” Frances looking as Samantha and Ben hugged each other; “tell me Ben, how have you progressed on writing in your fursona?”<br />
“My paw hurts just from trying to write my name,” Ben sitting back down at the table.<br />
“It takes time to master,” Frances smiling; “you get the swing of it eventually.”<br />
“Alex said as much,” Ben sighing as he looks at the ink still staining the fur on his paw; “his parents made him spend hours each day writing in his fursona. He hated it.”<br />
“But he can probably write his name with ease,” Samantha chiming in.<br />
“In cursive script,” Ben feeling glum.<br />
“Cheer up,” Frances placing a hand on her son’s furry paw; “you get the hang of it one day.”<br />
“Other than breaking pens and pencils,” Samantha mixing in the broccoli and sauce before covering the frying pan; “what else have you done today?”<br />
<br />
“Be with Alex after he came back from work,” Ben watching as Saffron decides to jump onto the table demanding scratches from him; “nothing much after that. Alex did mention that he and Nate have a big sod installation job this Saturday,” Ben speaking; “since the money is good, I’ll be working for Nate.”<br />
“You don’t seem thrilled,” Frances looking at her son; “why is that?”<br />
“Because I never thought Nate’s landscaping business would be this successful,” Ben answering; “when that snowstorm came through December, I joked that there would be good money to be made shoveling driveways. Never thought it would turn into mowing lawns and laying sod,” Ben mumbling.<br />
“Your jealous,” Samantha responding; “Nate found his calling and you are feeling left out.”<br />
“It’s not that,” Ben letting Saffron climb onto his shoulders mewling for attention; “he gets to spend more time with Alex after school and on the weekends.”<br />
“Definitely jealous,” Frances smirking as she rolls her eyes; “Now go and tell Alex and my brother supper is nearly ready. I’m assuming Alex is spending the night here.”</p>
