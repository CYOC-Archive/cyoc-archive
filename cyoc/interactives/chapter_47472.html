<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First things first, you decide to put the light away since now that you have used it on yourself you have no desire to risk losing or breaking it. Hiding in in the back of your sock drawer you smile to yourself in anticipation of the further fun you can have with the light.<br />
<br />
For now though, there is the fun you can have now that you have changed yourself into a girl, but first you need to figure out where to start. While thinking of where you might want to start, should you call up your girlfriend? should you do a little 'self exploration'?, you look around your room, noticing how nothing has changed. Your X-BOX and videogame collection are still there, the posters on your walls are still of women and cars, often both, there is still a pile of dirty clothing in the corner looking just the same as it did before you changed yourself into a woman. All in all, there is no indication that your room belongs to a girl, which is exactly what you wanted. The idea of being totally feminine in behavior is a bit too much for you, so you are glad that it is only your appearance that has changed.<br />
<br />
In the end you decide that maybe sleeping on it is the best option, after all, you can stay a girl for as long as you like, so you might as well take your time with things.<br />
<br />
Getting ready for bed proves to be the same as ever, mostly.<br />
<br />
When you take off your shirt you do stop for a moment to examine yourself. The first thing you notice is that you are not wearing a bra, but your breasts are small enough that you can get away with it. If you had to guess, you would say that they were probably a large a-cup. You cup them in your hands, admiring their firmness and smiling at the way your nipples perk up, but to your mild surprise, you do not feel turned on. For a moment you fear you have removed your sex drive, as you accidentally did with Gene earlier in the day, but all it takes is a thought to know that you are still interested in women. In the end you decide that it is because the breasts you are holding are your own that you are not that interested in them. You still very much want to experiment with your girlfriend while you are like this, but you can wait until tomorrow to do that.<br />
<br />
Upon removing your pants, you are surprised to find that you are still wearing boxers, and when you go over to your dresser, you find that your underwear drawer still contains mostly boxers, though there are several pairs plain, white cotton, panties in the back of the drawer, near a box of feminine hygiene products. The sight of the maxi-pads makes you wince. You will be turning yourself back to a guy before you have to worry about that, for sure. Just the thought of having a period creeps you out.<br />
<br />
Taking a clean pair of boxers from the drawer, you close it, still shuddering at the thought of that one particular aspect of being a woman. You put on the boxers, considering the possibility of whether or not you should wear a t-shirt to bed, but you decide against it. You always sleep shirtless in the summer and you see no reason to change things just because you have turned yourself into a woman. Being a woman is enough of a change, a thought that makes you smile.<br />
<br />
Turning off the light, you lay down in bed, only to hear soft footsteps in the hall, followed by a timid knock on your door.<br />
<br />
Used to your little brother's constant pestering, you sigh, &quot;What is it Lu-Lucy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You catch yourself just in time, remembering that you turned your brother into a girl and that you now have an all female family.<br />
<br />
The sound of your voice caught you off guard, though nowhere near the sultry voice Gene ended up with, there is still no mistaking it for a guy's voice. you have no time to think about this though, for on the other side of your door your little sister, Lucy, speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first you are tempted to tell her to go away, but you can tell that she sounds near tears.<br />
<br />
Turning on your light you get up and open your door, &quot;Come on in and tell me about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see her standing there in pink My Little Pony pajamas, then she rushed in and hugs you tightly as you guide her to your bed, &quot;It was terrible. I dreamed that I got home from school but mom and mommy weren't waiting for me at the bus stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile at her way of referring to your two female parents, but you are careful not to let her see that you are smiling, since she does seem genuinely upset.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath and fighting back a sob, she continues, &quot;But mom wasn't there. Instead there was a big scary man there with mommy. I started crying for mom and the big scary man knelt down and said that he was mom. Then he picked me up and mommy said that I had to be nice to the man because he was my new mom and that she liked him so much that she wanted to be a man too. I got away and started running, but he started chasing me and mommy was with him, only she wasn't mommy anymore, she was a man and he was so big that I couldn't run fast enough and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy ended with a sob and hugged you as tight as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; you say, patting her on the back, &quot;Mom and mommy aren't men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving the situation some thought, you ask, &quot;Are any of the kids in your school teasing you about mom and mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shakes her head violently, &quot;No...but today on the playground Melissa, Alice and me were playing house. I was being the mommy, Alice was being the mom and Melissa was the baby, but Melissa kept talking about how she didn't have a mom and mommy at home, she has a mommy and a daddy. She wasn't being mean, but I thought it was weird not having a mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite your best efforts, you laugh, &quot;Most families have a mother and father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Lucy frowns, &quot;and I'm glad that I got lucky and have a mom and mommy instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, amazed at how much reality has changed for your family, &quot;Are you feeling better now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lucy mutters, not sounding better at all.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to send her to bed just to have her come back a minute later, you decide to try and find out what else has her upset, &quot;Come on, tell me what else is getting to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a bedtime story,&quot; she says quickly, looking up at you with pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but a short one,&quot; you say as you pick her up and carry her back to her room, surprised at how much heavier she seems now that you are a woman rather than a man.<br />
<br />
Once you have her back in her bed you get less than half way into one of her pokemon picture books before she is sound asleep. Before turning off the light and leaving, you look around your little sister's room. The pokemon posters from when she was a boy are still there, as are the binders of pokemon cards, but there are also Barbie dolls and stuffed animals on her shelves, and a doll house in the corner of her room. Her bed sheets have pokemon on them, just like Luke's did, but the walls of the room are pink rather than blue. All in all, it is a very odd room for a little girl.<br />
<br />
Smiling at how unusual your family has become while still considering itself to be normal and having the rest of the world see it as normal, you leave your sister's room and head back to bed.<br />
<br />
By the time you get into bed, your own changes feel so natural that you forget about them until you roll over and move your arm against your chest. Confused for a moment, you rub at your chest, trying to figure out what it is that you feel until you remember that you turned yourself into a girl. The recollection brings a smile to your face. Tomorrow you plan to call your girlfriend as soon as possible and have some fun.</p>
