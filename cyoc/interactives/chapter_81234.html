<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny started up the strange looking computer and was shocked at just what was on it. There were details of <br />
every single family member on it, normal things like age and height, all the way to uncomfortably specific <br />
things like penis size and sexual interests. His profile seemed to have been opened recently, something that <br />
said &quot;Time Acceleration: 1 year every 48 minutes&quot; as the last change, whatever that meant. He clicked on his <br />
hair type, which said &quot;severely balding, brown&quot; and a bunch of options came up. He could change his hair <br />
colour, he could make it longer or shaved off, he could even adjust the age his male pattern baldness <br />
appeared, he could have a full head of hair again. Of course, it would only be a simulation. It could never <br />
happen in real life. &quot;Well it's a weird game. I'm surprised and pretty uncomfortable that you've managed to <br />
get all these statistics on us. But I have no idea what it has to do with why I feel so confused about my age <br />
at the moment. Maybe I have some weird form of amnesia. It's like I remember my life now, but I have memories <br />
of being a kid yesterday, and being a teenager this morning, and you were my uncle but now you're my brother, <br />
it's just all so confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark placed his hairy hand on his brother's shoulder and said &quot;You don't understand, it's not a game. It's <br />
real. I made a change so you would get older throughout the day. I made all of us older yesterday, but now <br />
you're the only one aging at the moment. Look, just make one little change to yourself and you'll see I'm <br />
right&quot;.<br />
<br />
Danny didn't believe what Mark was telling him, why would he make everyone in the family so old? But he <br />
decided to make a change anyway. He clicked on the MPB button and adjusted the scale so he didn't start losing <br />
his hair at 18, but will start loosing it at 25. He clicked the accept button and an energy wave emitted from <br />
the device. His almost clear scalp started to itch as all his lost hair grew back in and thicker than ever. It <br />
lengthened considerably until it hung past his shoulders. New memories appeared in his mind where he started <br />
growing his hair out because he knew his family genes meant early baldness and he wanted to experience having <br />
long hair before that happened. He tugged on the new hair. He couldn't believe it had just grown like that. He <br />
wouldn't believe it. His brain was fighting itself over his new memories and his knowledge of his previous <br />
life. In the end, his new, stronger memories won the battle for dominance. His eyes glazed slightly and he <br />
said &quot;No, my hair is still the same as it was. I'm sorry but I don't know what sort of thing you're planning <br />
with this thing. If you're not going to take my concerns seriously then I'll just talk to Jay&quot;. He got up and <br />
left the room. Mark was dismayed, why didn't Danny even notice his hair grow? He looked like he'd noticed at <br />
first, then just forgot about it. Maybe his awareness of the situation was too strong. But he was able to <br />
realise he'd more than doubled in age since going to bed last night. He combed his fingers through his long, <br />
greying beard in thought. It didn't seem like something he should concern himself with at the moment. Danny <br />
was just unaware enough to not rouse suspicion from anyone. He turned the Chronivac off and decided to have an <br />
early lunch.<br />
<br />
Jay was in his room reading a book he'd bought earlier that week, reading glasses perched on his nose. He <br />
heard a knock on his door and his brother Danny came in. He seemed a bit unnerved about something. It was <br />
probably about his hair again, thinking he showed signs of receding. But he had unnaturally thick and long <br />
hair for a member of their family, definitely from their mom's side of the family. Yet he had a brain block <br />
trying to remember who she was. &quot;Hey bro, what's eating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny stared a bit at Jay, he could remember being the man's son and yet that couldn't be right because Simon <br />
was his dad. His memories were conflicting with each other and it was hurting his head. Maybe Jay had the <br />
answers. &quot;Well this is going to sound weird, but have you noticed anything odd happening in the family? Like <br />
we should be younger than we actually are?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jay took off his glasses and thought about this. It certainly sounded a familiar concept to him, and yet he <br />
didn't know why. Something deep inside him felt like he should be younger, and yet that's because he was 40 <br />
now. His hair was starting to become more grey than brown, and his weight was verging on dangerous for a man <br />
his age. Of course he'd love to be younger, but unless someone discovered the fountain of youth, it wasn't <br />
going to happen. He just wished he could go back and do things differently. He'd missed the chance at having <br />
his own child, and he regretted it. &quot;Well it's just what happens when you get older. There's nothing you could <br />
do about that I'm afraid&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I literally mean we should be younger. I have vivid memories of being a kid yesterday, and now I'm 25. <br />
It's like time is moving faster than it should&quot;. Danny felt a bit frustrated at how insane he sounded.<br />
<br />
Jay massaged his bald head in concern. &quot;I think you just had a bad dream. It's nothing to be concerned about. <br />
I dreamt I once killed a friend of mine and I tried to hide all evidence of it until he came by the shop later <br />
in the afternoon. Man, that was a crazy day... Anyway, I suggest you go do something to take your mind off <br />
things for a while. I think Mark's about to go to the gym, maybe you should join him&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks&quot;. He left Jay to get back to reading. But he didn't really want to spend <br />
more time with Mark at the moment. He was weirded out by that device he showed him. Surely it couldn't really <br />
change reality. No, his memories of being younger had to be a dream. He wiped some hair out of his face, <br />
thinking maybe he should really cut it now. It was getting in his way at the shop, and he hated having to tie <br />
it back. No sooner had the thought appeared that his hair instantly shortened to a messy layered style. His <br />
temples were starting to show the first signs of recession. He was confused, but passed it off as missing his <br />
longer hair. Maybe he shouldn't of got it cut, but he did look better without it surrounding his face all the <br />
time. But wasn't he was just standing there with longer hair? Maybe he'd go with Mark to the gym after all. A <br />
good workout should clear his head. He grabbed his gear from his room and went to find Mark, who was in the <br />
kitchen with some coffee and reading the paper. &quot;Hey, Jay said you were heading to the gym. Mind if I tag <br />
along?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark noticed his brother's new shorter hair, but didn't say anything about it. He wasn't planning on going to <br />
the gym, but if it let him spend more time with Danny then he could observe his changes more. &quot;Sure, just go <br />
and start the car while I grab my stuff&quot;. Danny got the keys from Simon, who gave him a second strange look <br />
that day. Was it something on his face? He left the old man to go to the car. Simon was ever more confused. <br />
Since when did he have three sons? He was sure that Danny was Jay's son, and yet he was much too old for that <br />
to be logical. No, Danny was his son. Maybe he was getting forgetful in his old age. Or maybe the boy had used <br />
the Chronivac to make himself older. It's made reality changes before. Speaking of which, he'd barely looked <br />
at the machine since the beginning of the week. Maybe he should check on it to make sure everything was <br />
running OK. But not while his programme was on. He'd have to remember to look at it later. Mark came through <br />
to say goodbye, his beard tied up so it wouldn't get in his way at the gym, and left the original three in the <br />
house.</p>
