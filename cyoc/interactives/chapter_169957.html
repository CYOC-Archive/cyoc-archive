<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You try to ignore Ronnie&#39;s very large problem while you decide what bean to try next. Like with your last change as a business man, you can tell that the new reality of this bean is trying to take over. You&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s the amount of beans you&#39;ve had that are making it harder to remember your original life, but you know you don&#39;t want to remain as this hairy, overweight middle aged Scotsman for much longer. Finding your age to be the biggest problem by far, you decide to pick up another light blue bean. You also fish for another bean that might look like it will put things back to normal. After a bit of digging you find another blue bean covered in arrows, and while the last bean Ronnie took to turn him gay was covered in arrows pointing in all different directions, this bean&#39;s arrows all pointed in one direction from top to bottom. You could guess which end was the bottom of the bean as one end was much thicker, giving the bean a bit of an eggplant shape.<br />
<br />
You hold out the bean to Ronnie. &quot;Ready for another try laddie? Wouldn&#39;t want yeh feeling left out. And maybe it&#39;ll get ya to stop staring at me like tha!&quot; You&#39;re trying not to, but finding it impossible to avoid your new Scottish accent. It&#39;s like your tongue just doesn&#39;t move in the same way it used to.<br />
<br />
By this point, Ronnie&#39;s erection has started to die down as he starts to regain control of his newfound sexuality. But you notice that he still hasn&#39;t stopped blushing, and doesn&#39;t make full eye contact when he speaks. &quot;Yeah um... hopefully it will...&quot; His voice is still the same posh British accent he started with, but are you imagining he is sounding a bit more feminine than before? He takes the arrow bean from you and you both start to eat.<br />
<br />
By this point the warming feeling of transformation is starting to feel familiar, and you immediately start to notice your pounds melting away. Your sagging midsection is getting smaller by the second, and your extremely meaty chest is deflating as well. Looking in the mirror, you see your hairline start to creep forward back to its original youthful position as your sandy blonde hair shapes itself into a stylish quiff, and the sides of your hair shorten into a harsh fade. Your face regains its youthful appearance and you are happy to see it doesn&#39;t look like you will be passing too far back into childhood. As the fat finishes receding from your body you are still left with all of the new muscle from the last bean, leaving your body looking astonishingly athletic, with very low body fat and a physique that anyone would be jealous of. Your professional looking shirt, far too big for you now, starts to sew itself back up along the buttons and the material starts to shift into a light mesh. As it shrinks to conform to your leaner body the sleeves shorten and the design shifts to black with white lettering that you recognize as a football (soccer) jersey. Your kilt also shrinks to conform to your muscular legs (which you now notice are bursting with lean muscle) to become a tight pair of black football shorts. Your shoes even reshape into a large pair of football cleats. It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;ve lost any body hair, so as you lift your shirt you see your newly visible muscles and rock-hard six pack are still coated in a forest of blonde hair. You were now a gorgeous young man in his prime, bursting with muscles and energy. You smile and flex into the mirror, enjoying your sharp good looks far more than the bear you had been moments before.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ronnie is not having quite such good luck. His transformation also began with him getting smaller, but for him it was his muscles shrinking. All the strong physique he gained from his first bean shrunk back into himself and left him looking tall and lanky. That was shortly fixed as he started to shrink vertically as well, leaving him almost the same height as when he was 12, although it didn&#39;t look like he actually got much younger. One part of his body spared from shrinking was his ass, which as his trousers formed themselves into an incredibly tight pair of skinny jeans you notice had if anything ballooned a bit, leaving his rear end looking comically large on his otherwise petite frame. His shirt also shrank to conform to his very small torso and continued getting smaller beyond that, leaving his naval and still defined (if very lean) abs exposed and finally lightening into a white crop top. His face was left mostly unchanged, although his recently acquired facial hair all faded away along with the rest of the hair on his body, while his facial features softened a bit into what you would best describe as &quot;cute.&quot; Shaken by his changes and looking rather frightened, the first thing you saw Ronnie do was unbutton his jeans and pull on his underwear&#39;s waistband to glance at his package, and you saw him blanche in horror, clearly upset with what he was seeing. Next he got an odd look as he absentmindedly rubbed his chest, and with another surprised look of horror lifted his crop top to discover that the left nipple of his small but cut pecs was pierced by a decently sized silver loop.<br />
<br />
With both of your physical changes apparently complete, you looked around at the room to discover that the bedroom-turned-office had now become a double University residence room, with one side decorated with football paraphernalia and posters, and the other with a few posters of shirtless male models and a few scientific posters you didn&#39;t recognize at all (would you have before? You&#39;re not sure... one was a colourful chart with lots of small boxes you could swear had something to do with chemistry... but the thought is gone almost as quickly as it came). New memories start flooding in and you know that you are a 19 year old University student on a political science course, but not doing very well as you spend most of your time playing football with the lads. Ronnie, now also 19, is your randomly assigned roommate, and although you get along fine you don&#39;t really run in the same circles as him, who you recall is a computer science major and a very effeminate gay man. Although, as you look at him some other memories creep in of returning from some drunken nights out at the pub and getting to work on Ronnie&#39;s exceedingly feminine ass. You are pretty sure you&#39;re straight... but it&#39;s possible that if you&#39;re drunk enough you don&#39;t really care what your bigger than average dick lands in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right lad, well tha didnae exactly go to plan, did it?&quot; Damn, still Scottish then. Ronnie just stares past you, the little twink looking very uncomfortable as he clearly brings to mind the same memories that you just recalled. No, these beans are definitely not all that innocent.</p>
