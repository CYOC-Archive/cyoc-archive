<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She didn&#39;t know why she had agreed to easily. Being a girl, she found, was often confusing and took more adjusting than she&#39;d thought, even though she had memories and experiences of growing of one. Her male mind, severly diminished, insisted that if felt weird to sit on her bike seat and feel it pressing into the area between her legs, to feel it pressing against the crotch of her shorts, which pressed into her panties, and thus pressed, comfortably, nicely, she discovered, into her girl parts. Biking to the mall with her sister, something she found odd in how suddenly closer they were, she tried to put it from her mind and just go with it.<br />
<br />
But found, as they locked their bicycles and headed in, she was still being confronted with how different it was being a girl comparted to being a guy.<br />
<br />
At a hamburger restaurant, she ordered a single cheeseburger, a small fries and a water instead of her usual of two double cheeseburgers, large fries and a medium pop. After they&#39;d eaten, she and Tanya then spent the time browsing the clothing stores. Her female self insisted this was normal and something she often did with her big sister, whilst her male self said it wasn&#39;t. When she went in to a store to try on a couple bikinis, and get her sister&#39;s opinion, she was surprised to find it showed her how much of a girl she had become, as talking and modelling clothes wasn&#39;t something she wouldn&#39;t have done, not with Tanya, or anyone for that matter, when she&#39;d been a boy, nor would have felt comfortable doing.<br />
<br />
After that, they left the mall and headed over to the rec centre, where she met coach Sara, who it turned out was Nancy&#39;s mom.<br />
<br />
The older woman sizing Chris up, she eventually noded and told her, &quot;Let&#39;s see what you can before we put you in,&quot; and after getting her size, she handed her a jersey and shorts and directed her, &quot;Lockers are over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the uniform and following Tanya, Chris was suddenly leery about being in the same room as a bunch of girls. Worried they&#39;d notice something was off, she furrowed her brow and tried to tell herself it would be okay, that all they would see was another girl. Entering the locker room, she almost stopped when she rounded the corner and found two girls in states of undress. Still trying to go with it as her mind insisted that it wasn&#39;t anything new, even as her male mind insisted that that the only boobs and bush she had ever seen were those in the magazines she kept hidden in his closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Jessica, our center,&quot; Tanya indicated to the tallest and closest of the two girls, then nodding at the other, she said, &quot;This is Annie, our small forward,&quot; and after getting a greeting from the other two, she told them, &quot;This is my sister, Chris. She&#39;ll be subbing for Aimee. At least for this and the next game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope she can play better than Aimee can,&quot; Annie called out in a not-so-serious tone as a third girl came in, who Chris learned was Diana, their shooting guard.<br />
<br />
Shown to a locker afterward, Chris hesitated for a brief second as she caught sight of Jessica, now completely nude, and clearly having no issue with being so. But as she turned her attention to the locker, and listened as Diana began jokingly teasing Jessica for shaving her crotch, Chris took a deep breath as her mind instead that she&#39;d done this before. Starting to change, she folded up her clothes and put them on the shelves, instead of just cramming them in the locker, like she had down when she&#39;d been a guy. Searching her purse, she pulled the baggy with the panties and underwear out, searched for a fresh tampon, and figuring she take care of it before she got busy with anything else, took the jersey, shorts, undergarments and feminine product and walked naked across the locker room to the bathroom area, where she refreshed herself and dressed.<br />
<br />
Out on the court, she was confronted with a another aspect of how being a girl was different, though her mind insisted it wasn&#39;t anything new. Warming up with the other girls, they ran through drills, and then she was assigned power forward, Aimee&#39;s spot. During all of this, she thought on what she saw and what her mind insisted was normal, and then decided it was better that she was more willing to work with the other members of the team, rather then doing things as an individual, as she&#39;d done as a boy.<br />
<br />
When they finished, and the coach called them to the sideline, Chris expected they would be given a motivational speech, like her coaches had done when she&#39;d been on the boy&#39;s basketball team. But, to her surprise, coach Sara didn&#39;t, and instead praised them all and further instilled the sense of trust they each had in her and with each other. When the buzzer sounded, and they moved out onto the court, and before Chris lost herself in game, she noted that, while there was competitiveness, it wasn&#39;t as fierce and at the same level of a boy&#39;s game. The focus, she noted, seemed to have shifted from the attitude she had as a boy of, &quot;Must win,&quot; to one of companionship, of being one with the rest of the team, and a sense of general comadery. Getting the ball, which thought might be smaller, but she wasn&#39;t sure, she looked at the basket and knew that, as a guy, she would have taken a shot, but instead, she passed it off and moving down the court, she began to work with the other players.<br />
<br />
And as she got into the game, and focused on how she could improve herself and help her team, she observed that it felt like she&#39;d done something wrong when a mistake was made, noted there wasn&#39;t the same amount of bickering like there was on the guy&#39;s team, and then she gave herself over to it and what her mind told her she knew how to do and had been doing for some time. Helping the team she was on win, she found as the final buzzer sounded that she had a deeper understanding as to why that while winning wasn&#39;t overly important, it was this time, as it put the team a step closer to the finals, something the team was hoping for. Heading back to the locker rooms, talking with the rest of the girls, Chris didn&#39;t hesitate this time as she entered.<br />
<br />
In front of the locker she&#39;d been assigned, she stripped off the uniform, underwear and bra, dumped the undergarments back in the Ziploc bag, the jersey and shorts in the laundry bag near the coach&#39;s office, and headed for the showers. Seeing no problem with sharing bottles of shampoo and body wash Tanya, she showered. Talking with the other girls about the game, Chris didn&#39;t even blink when Nancy said, &quot;Does anyone have an extra pad or tampon I could use? The machine in the bathroom is empty,&quot; to which she automatically told the other girl, &quot;I have one. It&#39;s in my purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nancy replied before she headed toward the lockers.<br />
<br />
Forgetting the amulet for the moment, Chris finished her washing herself. Figuring she&#39;d take a nice, long, relaxing bath before bed, she followed her sister and Jessica out of the showers. Talking about the next game, which was in a week, Chris began to towel herself off and then started to get dressed. Spotting her purse, it suddenly came back to her about who she really was. Suddenly feeling conspiculous standing in the girl&#39;s locker room, wearing only a bra and panties, Chris took a deep breath. Trying to find the ease she&#39;d been experiencing before, she peeked into her purse. Seeing the Amulet of Zulo was still in the baggy, she told herself, &quot;Just get through the rest of the evening and in the morning, you can go back to being your normal self,&quot; then smiling as she reached for the rest of her clothes, she amended, &quot;Well, at least until the next game.&quot;</p>
