<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Felt a recent bit of motivation to try and continue the story. I have a slight idea for where I want to take it, especially with Connor, Zack, and Micah.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So, you got any plans for the rest of the day?” Zack asked casually, his voice tinged with his typical playful undertone. “Or were you just gonna sit around all day and wonder what it’s like to be a big, bad wolf?”<br />
<br />
Connor scoffed, shoving his hands into his pockets. “I wasn’t-“<br />
<br />
“Sure you weren’t,” Zack chuckled, bumping shoulders with him as he walked forward a few steps. He twisted around to walk backwards facing Connor, hands propped behind his head. “Though if you want to do all that somewhere different from your parent’s place, why not come to my place? Micah’s probably already there, and we always love some company.”<br />
<br />
Connor gave Zack a somewhat surprised look. “You’ve got a house?”<br />
<br />
“Yep!” Zack replied, flashing a toothy grin. “Micah and I own a small house right on the edge of the forest. Managed to get it fairly cheap thanks to a little negotiating from Logan. If you’re lucky, Micah might’ve even tidied up a bit.”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated, the thought of spending time with Zack and Micah feeling…strangely appealing. “I don’t know, man. I don’t want to intrude or anything…”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t be intruding,” Zack insisted. “We just get a bit wild sometimes. Nothing you haven’t already gotten a taste of.”<br />
<br />
Connor rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah.”<br />
<br />
Zack laughed, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking ahead a little. “Trust me C, this’ll do you some good. Hang out, relax, maybe talk things through a bit. Trust me: Micah and I know how to help people unwind.”<br />
<br />
Connor glanced up at the sky, the clouds slowly beginning to shift. Maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad idea. He hadn’t exactly been eager to spend the rest of the day alone, especially with so many questions floating around his mind.<br />
<br />
He exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Alright, I’ll come.”<br />
<br />
Zack shot him a smirk. “I knew you’d come around, C. C’mon.”<br />
<br />
- - - - - -<br />
<br />
The walk to Zack’s house wasn’t long, though Connor wasn’t sure he’d be able to find it on his own for a while. The path Zack led him down felt unfamiliar—cutting across quiet streets before eventually walking down a dirt road into the forest. It wasn’t long until a house came into view. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t flashy by any means—just simple white siding with a pale green trim, a short set of stairs leading up to a wide front porch, and a well-worn welcome mat. The roof looked as if it had recently been patched in places, and the gutters were slightly crooked in some spots. Zack and Micah had clearly put time into maintaining the place—maybe not perfectly, but with care. <br />
<br />
“Here we are,” Zack said, stepping ahead and unlocking the door. “Not much, but hey—it’s ours.”<br />
<br />
“Looks good,” Connor commented as he took a step onto the porch. “A lot cozier than I would have expected.”<br />
<br />
Zack grinned as he pushed the door open. “Wait until you see the inside. It’s got some character.”<br />
<br />
The door creaked open into a narrow entryway that fed right into the living room. The space wasn’t large—maybe just enough room for the essentials—but it felt inviting in a way Connor hadn’t expected. <br />
<br />
A low couch sat against the wall, the cushions clearly a bit worn from years of use. The coffee table was cluttered with magazines, a dish or two, controllers, and a tv remote. A decently worn armchair with plenty of claw marks took up the corner near the window. <br />
<br />
The kitchen was partially open to the living space, separated by a half-wall with a narrow counter. Connor could smell a lingering meaty scent, indicating that it had likely been used just recently. <br />
<br />
Connor took a few steps inside, letting the front door fall shut behind him. The place had its quirks, sure—but there was a warmth to it. Something about the way the furniture was arranged, or maybe just the subtle scent in the air, made it all feel…safe. <br />
<br />
Zack slipped his shoes off and flopped down on the couch with a satisfied groan. He glanced at Connor and patted the cushion beside him. <br />
<br />
“Sit. Relax. You made it through a hell of a first week.”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated for a second before joining him, the couch dipping slightly under their combined weight. Their knees brushed, and Connor pretended not to notice.<br />
<br />
Zack noticed. <br />
<br />
“You know,” he said, stretching his arms above his head in a way that exposed a bit of his toned stomach, “I gotta say—I wasn’t expecting you to come around this fast. Figured you’d still be running and screaming in the woods.”<br />
<br />
Connor snorted. “Trust me, I thought about it. But…I don’t know. I guess it’s not <i>that</i> crazy, considering everything I’ve been feeling lately.”<br />
<br />
“Mm. Felt, huh?” Zack tilted his head, his grin turning a bit sly. “You mean that buzz in your chest? That little voice in the back of your head telling you to get closer to the people who know exactly what you’re going through?” <br />
<br />
Connor swallowed. “Something like that.”<br />
<br />
Their eyes met, and for a moment, the room felt a bit warmer. Zack leaned in, his voice lower.<br />
<br />
“You’re not alone in this, Connor. You’ve got us. Me, Micah, Eric. Even Logan, though he acts like he’s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.” He chuckled softly. “Though I meant what I said. We take care of our own, and so long as you’re one of us, we’ll take care of you.”<br />
<br />
Connor looked down, figuring with a loose string on his jeans. “It’s weird. I haven’t…felt connected like this in a long time.”<br />
<br />
Zack’s voice softened. “You always had a place here. Even when you didn’t know it yet.” Connor felt Zack’s hand move onto his thigh, slowly and gently moving up toward…<br />
<br />
The sound of an opening door made Connor’s head snap up. He looked toward the source and saw Micah emerge from the small hallway, wearing nothing but a pair of gym shorts. He raised an eyebrow at the sight of the two on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Well well,” he said, smirking slightly. “You two are alone for an hour or two, and it already feels like I’ve walked in on something.”<br />
<br />
Zack didn’t flinch. “Took ya long enough. I was telling Connor how he belonged with us.”<br />
<br />
Micah raised a brow as he crossed the room. “That so?”<br />
<br />
Connor coughed awkwardly. “Not like that, I mean. I just—he was saying that I…that you guys have my back.”<br />
<br />
“We do,” Micah confirmed, his gaze steady as he perched himself on the edge of the armchair. “Always.”<br />
<br />
The silence that followed wasn’t uncomfortable—just thick with something unspoken. Connor could feel both Zack and Micah’s eyes on him, but he found it hard to look either of them in the eye.<br />
<br />
Micah leaned toward Connor with a low hum. “If you’re worried about what just happened, don’t be. Zack and I…we don’t do the whole <i>possessive mate</i> thing. We’re open. We trust each other.”<br />
<br />
Zack didn’t object, looking at Connor with quiet amusement. Eventually, he leaned in a bit, his voice low. “That’s why I told you before…if you ever wanted in, all you have to do is ask.”<br />
<br />
Connor’s pulse quickened, his breath catching as his gaze flicked between the two of them. <br />
<br />
“I—uh…” he stammered. “I think I…need a drink…”<br />
<br />
Zack chuckled. “Help yourself to whatever’s in the fridge. We got soda, beer, and something strong that Micah hides behind the oatmeal.”<br />
<br />
Micah rolled his eyes. “Because someone keeps drinking it when they think I won’t notice.”<br />
<br />
Connor stood a bit too quickly, muttering something about checking the fridge. As he walked away, he couldn’t help but hear the low exchange behind him. <br />
<br />
Zack’s voice, barely above a whisper, “Told ya he’s cute when he’s flustered.”<br />
<br />
Micah replied. “Told you not to scare him off. Let him come around on his own.”<br />
<br />
“Hey! I’m at least trying to help him before the higher libido kicks in!”<br />
<br />
Connor’s heart was pounding in his ears as he opened the fridge, hands shaking slightly. He wasn’t entirely sure how to respond to everything that was happening. But beneath the nerves…there was a spark. A pull. A curiosity he couldn’t deny. <br />
<br />
Whatever was happening between them…it was only just beginning.</p>
