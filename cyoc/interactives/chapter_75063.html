<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Morgana could proceed there was a loud pounding at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; Morgana said in a vexed tone, &quot;The barn is enchanted so, it cannot be any of our visitors, except <br />
maybe the bird, but he's too small to knock so loudly.&quot;  She started downstairs, and then looked back. She <br />
shouted, &quot;Come along, apprentice.&quot; She snapped her fingers, and all the dolls were back on their shelves and <br />
the cupboard shut itself.  You hurry after her.<br />
<br />
Another round of pounding. &quot;It's too late for visitors. Go away!&quot; complained the witch, &quot;I need my beauty <br />
rest.&quot;  Of course, she knew that the people downstairs outside the stone walls couldn't hear her.<br />
<br />
She reached the door, and glanced into the mirror next to the door, and frowned.  There was no reflection in <br />
the glass. She harumphed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess they got tired of waiting and left,&quot; she said testily, &quot;I'd curse them for that alone, if I knew who <br />
they were.&quot; She pointed at the mirror. The image of nothing outside remained. Then the pounding started again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps they're invisible?&quot; she posited uncertainly.<br />
<br />
I took a step back, I may be a humble princess/apprentice, but the only thing I know that can pound on a door <br />
and doesn't have a reflection is something undead. Witches have the power to summon and control the undead, <br />
but clearly Morgana didn't summon her visitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, who's there? And what do you want?&quot; Morgana demanded through the tiny iron grille in the door that <br />
she opened inside the larger door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am here for Prince Aladdin.  I know you have him,&quot; demanded a shrill female voice.<br />
<br />
Morgana peered through the grille and then looked at the still empty mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most peculiar.  You appear to be a frail young woman, but my magic mirror says that is an illusion. What are <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Princess Jasmine. Now release Aladdin and our friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're Princess Jasmine?  But I was told she was ill.  Then I was told she was a horse.  How did you get <br />
here?  Agrabba is at least two fortnights journey on the fastest horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Princess Jasmine.  You know that. Your panacea cured me, but the translocation spell as the bottom of the <br />
phial swapped me with an old mare from the fruit vendor's cart outside the palace gate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It did,&quot; Morgana laughed, &quot;You in a horse collar, now that would be rich.  However, if it were true, you <br />
couldn't be here, unless you were now a vampire.  Which would explain why you don't cast a reflection in my <br />
mirrors either. So I'm not inviting you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, witch, I'm no vampire, but you'll wish I was when I get through with you, if you continue to resist.&quot;<br />
<br />
She whispered to her apprentice, &quot;Feisty. I must add her to my trophy closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Jafar, the rest of my first wish,&quot; Jasmine said to some unseen force.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Princess,&quot; said an oily voice, &quot;If you just had wished us both out of the Cave of Wonders, this <br />
would be so much simpler, and really multi-part wishes should count as multiple wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, such luck, Jafar.  I got the wording from Genie based on the genie handbook ages ago for just such a <br />
situation as this.  Now complete my first wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jafar sighed loudly.<br />
<br />
Jago woke with a fright. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know that sigh!  It's Jafar! Wake up, wake up, I just heard Jafar!&quot; squawked the parrot.<br />
<br />
Aladdin whinnied, and Abou through mud - at least Jago hoped it was mud. Genie said, &quot;Jafar's in the cave of <br />
wonders for 10,000 years. You're just having a nightmare, Jago. Go back to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, so shall it be!&quot; roared Jafar.<br />
<br />
Everyone awoke.  Genie said, &quot;You dream really loudly, Jago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a dream, now turn Aladdin back into a man, so we can put the old master back into his shiny black <br />
lamp!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Hocus Pocus, Horse Out of Focus, Man in Focus,&quot; muttered genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hocus Pocus?&quot; Jago said in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, that should have worked,&quot; the genie said in alarm. &quot;It must be this barn. It's enchanted against magic. <br />
Old witch didn't trust me after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it's magic proof, then Aladdin's stuck as a horse as long as he's in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now witch, this is your last chance,&quot; Princess Jasmine said.<br />
<br />
Aladdin turned around and whinnied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he's calling Jasmine.  Stand clear he's going to knock down the stall door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aladdin kicked and kicked. Wood cracked and splintered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I figured it was enchanted too,&quot; Genie said in surprise as the door splintered and broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little tip, genie. Witch's magic tends to fail when exposed to iron or salt.  That's why Jafar ended up in <br />
a black iron lamp.  His wizardry won't work on it, and his genie powers are bound by those special manacles <br />
linked to the lamp.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Aladdin made it through the barn door, he became a naked man again.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little help, Genie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rooty tooty, something suity,&quot; Genie said.<br />
<br />
The bird groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I need my 8 hours sleep to come up with my best spells,&quot; the genie explained, and the oohed as he saw <br />
Aladdin was dressed as a chimney sweep. &quot;I said suity not sooty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least, I don't have to stare at his little brown butt,&quot; the bird said flying through the hole. Abu and <br />
Genie followed. The nag went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmine!&quot; Aladdin shouted as he ran to the castle entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, enough is enough!&quot; said Morgana flinging open the doors and striding out with her long gnarled staff <br />
glowing with preternatural power. &quot;I'm in charge here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really, Morgana?&quot; said Jafar appearing as a translucent red misty image of himself stretching high into <br />
the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya, Master, long time no see! Looks like you been working out,&quot; said Jago flapping so as to hide Aladdin <br />
from Jafar's view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jago, so good of you to notice. You cannot protect Aladdin, and you don't need to protect him either. <br />
Princess Jasmine rubbed my lamp and made a wish. I'm here to save you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmine did what? Oh, this is bad- I mean, good. Uh, I don't know what I mean.  Is it safe to have this much <br />
magic in one place?  I feel like a canary in a mine. There's just soo much, magic. It's intox-?&quot; Jago swooned <br />
and Aladdin caught him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jago, what did Jafar do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Jafar-everyone.  Too much magic in one place. Genie tell them, critical mass,&quot; the bird squawked, &quot;Get <br />
away while you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magical Critical Mass?&quot; said the genie, &quot;Oh, uh, Aladdin remember that water balloon you wanted to drop on <br />
the guards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, Genie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Al, it's important. It's relevant to this situation. What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that have to do with this situation? I just over filled it and it exploded all over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, and this place is so saturated with magic that it's about to explode unless we can diffuse it. The <br />
best way is to get away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not leaving Jasmine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say you wish we were all back at the palace and say it fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Jasmine, me, you, Jago, Abou, and that horse were all back at the palace in Agraba, right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a flash and they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait for it?&quot; said Genie. There was only silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I was the critical mass?&quot; Genie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;In your dreams,&quot; said Jago sitting up, &quot;But we've seen the Cave of Wonders explode before. It does it all the <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Cave of Wonders, but we were at Morgana's keep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jago's right. I couldn't let Jafar leave the Cave of Wonders, so I simply wished that it existed <br />
simultaneously around Morgana's castle,&quot; Jasmine explained, &quot;And thank you so much genie for those crib notes <br />
on genie magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome, but never ever do that again. You could have blown us all up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don't understand, I thought you were that horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jafar figured it all out. He goes way back with Morgana. He used to be Jay the Magnificent, and his <br />
apprentice stole most of his powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, wait Morgana was Jafar's apprentice. I wondered why Jafar didn't double cross you. Only person he hates <br />
more than Aladdin is his former apprentice.  He'd never even speak her name. That's why he wanted genie, he <br />
wanted revenge on her for stealing his powers and making him need a familiar to do simple conjuring,&quot; Jago <br />
blurted out, &quot;What I'm a quick study, and the way Jasmine tells stories, it could take 1001 nights to get to <br />
the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So genie, can you tell  what happened between those two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jafar is still a genie in a lamp in the cave of wonders,&quot; Genie answered, &quot;And Morgana's keep didn't go <br />
boom. But I would be surprised if she's done with us yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, genie, not by a long shot,&quot; said Morgana wiping the soot from her face as she glared into a magic mirror <br />
watching the events unfolding in Agrabah, &quot;Not by a long shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she turned to me, and threw me a broom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clean up this mess, apprentice. I'm going to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stared at the ring of monoliths surrounding the keep.  They had absorbed most of the explosion. Many were <br />
toppled like dominoes, but most stood upright. She glared back at me from the stairway. So I started sweeping <br />
up the plaster and debris that was everywhere.  There had to be a better way, I stole a glance at her spell <br />
book. <br />
<br />
&quot;It'll take a 100 days with one broom to clean up this mess,&quot; I groaned. Then I looked at the spell book, &quot;Or <br />
maybe one day with a 100 enchanted brooms, or maybe an hour with a thousand?&quot; Did I dare?<br />
<br />
Jasmine looked at Aladdin, &quot;Take that straw out of your mouth, you look like a hayseed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Straw?&quot; said Aladdin, and he coughed up a stomach full of partially digested hay.<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed. Except Aladdin, who stole a nervous glance at the mare. He had been quite a stallion earlier <br />
that night.</p>
