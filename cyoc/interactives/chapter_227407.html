<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Imogen got home and she felt tired late on Sunday night. Deep inside her Charlie&#39;s nano-bot enhanced sperm were penetrating her, fertilizing eggs that shouldn&#39;t have been there. She found that her boobs hurt and she was being sick in the toilet quite a lot. Legally an adult she was the Captain of her school and the head cheerleader. Her lack of blonde hair was made up by her chest and girl next door looks. Now she didn&#39;t feel sexy, she felt bloated. She tried to pour herself some coffee but she smell and taste had her puking for a long time. With her head thrown over her shoulder she didn&#39;t know it but she was participating  in the ritual that all expecting mothers had to endure.<br />
<br />
Monday morning, fighting the nausea and fatigue she pulled on her private school uniform of a very old fashion pleated skirt and buttoned shirt. She hated it, they had to custom make a shirt to fit her rack. Since the age of 14 she had been constantly asked out but she was saving herself until she was an adult, so did she lose her head around some random transgender bitch? She felt dizzy, her boobs hurt and she had cramps in her stomach. She went to school feeling out of place. She managed to get through the classes without looking too phased but her tits swelled pushing into the buttons of her shirt. The cleavage was pushing open gaps in her shirt. <br />
<br />
She went to the toilet and put wet paper towels to stop the chaffing of her nipples inside her bra. She noticed that they had gone from pink to dark brown, that was impossible. She knew that, pregnancies didn&#39;t go so fast. In denial she went home, she found she had an appetite and had several rounds of McDonald&#39;s Cheeseburgers, licking her fingers. Girls from her school looked at her and frown lines appeared on their faces as if she were deformed or something. That night she ran a hand along her toned belly and felt a bump. About the size of a bird&#39;s egg, it was hard and unyielding. Crying she started to punch herself in the stomach. It was like cancer that showed her body was turning against her, she didn&#39;t feel maternal at all.<br />
<br />
Tuesday crying she tried to punch herself in the stomach to try and make this strange growth go away. Punching herself was too difficult as she couldn&#39;t get her elbow back enough. This just made her cry even harder. When her mother asked her what was going on she sobbed it was about her fears for the SATs that she had to sit in the coming weeks. Nerves, suicide, pressure were all one thing, but pregnancy? Even when she was on the pill? What the fuck was happening to her? Why was her body turning on her. She got ready for school, she tried to button up her pleat skirt. <br />
<br />
The buttons wouldn&#39;t fit and the fabric wouldn&#39;t wrap around her body.  She&#39;d ordered a girdle online, she fit her swollen middle into it and tried to wrap the skirt around her body. It didn&#39;t work and Imogen was hyperventilating. She improvised with string and tied it. She was at school when her pencil rolled onto the floor, on instinct she bent down to pick it up when the string snapped. It was like watching a train crash without the sound, her skirt was going to pool around her knees. Her belly was now about 72 hours old but looked closer to four or five months.<br />
<br />
This was something like out a fucking horror film. <br />
<br />
She held up her dress as a big rubber band was found, tying them into loops she managed to tie her skirt back together. She managed to slip home for another day from school. Come Wednesday she had a firm bulge in her middle and her tits were starting to leak. She used towels to try and cover up any discharge. Imogen also started carrying lots of rubber bands and wearing a sweater, she had gym but she had managed to skip out of that class by going to the school nurse. She felt movement in her belly, like butterflies were moving around. At least the morning sickness had passed. <br />
<br />
Wednesday was known as hump day, but now she had a hump. She had gotten a lift with her friend Chloe. Chloe however had picked up Amber and Pia. She looked like someone who was concealing something, the sweater made people stare at her middle even more. But she didn&#39;t know what to do. She was in denial, the last resort. Chloe told her to get in the front seat but she begged and pleaded with Chloe to let her sit in the back seat. She sat on the seat and felt like she was going to explode. Her breasts were bouncing and swaying with the slightest movement in body. Chloe had a petite body and was naturally fit, like a swimmer or rock climber. She had small breasts but everything was in perspective.  <br />
<br />
Chloe dropped her friends off and told Imogen to stay in the car. They went to an abandon park and sat on the ground with trees as support, Imogen had to sit with her legs to the side. She felt that despite her ass and ankles swelling her favorite cushion now had a hundred paper cuts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pregnant, but way to big. What the fuck is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Imogen cried and her story poured out of her. Chloe lifted up her sweater and underneath she saw the girdle and the bully bulging into it. Her belly button was now flat and had popped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Imogen cried not knowing what to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;What hurts the most?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My fucking tits!&quot; she sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a pump but for now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Horrified she watched as Chloe, her friend since she was 3, exposed a bloated tit with a brown ancient nipple attached.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing-arrggghhh!&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
Chloe started milking her best friend, sucking the breast milk away. <br />
<br />
&quot;FFFUUUCCCKK&quot; she moaned cupping Chloe&#39;s head with her hand as she orgasmed with release. Imogen&#39;s head was twisted to the side with pleasure, her eyes rolled white. She was a big fat cow and she needed to be milked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot; Chloe asked, a milky mustache on her upper lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Imogen could continue, Chloe found herself pressed against Imogen her mouth wrapped around one of her nipples, and sucking on as much as she could. Imogen let out another surprised moan but did not resist, a pleasant tingling running through her body as the pressure in her breast began to diminish. Her back to a tree, with a trembling hand, she grabbed her other breast and directed the nipple upwards until she could suck on it herself. The milk was sweet and almost intoxicating.<br />
<br />
Chloe felt herself light on her knees, and she guided Imogen down to lay into the grass while they kept on milking her breasts. Chloe pressed herself on top of Imogen, sucking avidly while humping Imogen&#39;s leg. Someone had defiled her best friend and she wanted to be defiled as well. The milk was laced with nano-bot and they were going straight through the blood/brain like semen through a busted rubber. Her wet clit was rubbing chaotically against Imogen&#39;s thigh, pushing back on the skirt, until it slid up the leg opening of Imogen&#39;s panties with a wet sound. <br />
<br />
As the two reached climax, howling in the bushes. The girls&#39; hips bucked against each other as they moaned in the grass, their school clothes stained with a mixture of milk and dirt. Imogen was a little pale, she had her first sexual encounter on a Sunday then her first gay encounter on a Wednesday. She was living life as if she had only days left to live. Patting down herself, she also realized she had more curves than earlier, as though she had gotten bigger or older. Imogen&#39;s belly was swelling noticeably forward, pushing the shirt wide open and lowering the skirt&#39;s elastic band. She looked at least six months pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh&quot; whispered Chloe.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; gasped Imogen, her brain scrambled by her orgasm. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just saw a foot press up against your skin.&quot;</p>
