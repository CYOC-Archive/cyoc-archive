<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>If this goes against the idea, I can take it down. I just like the idea of enough bonding(or maybe fluid) can change one animal bimbo into another. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ami giggled and answered &quot;Of course I would, lover.&quot; in a sultry voice. Something triggered in Andy with this response. &quot;Lover&quot;. He had fled into the woods to get away from the world, to get away from a failed marriage. To just rot alone out in the middle of nowhere with what peace of mind he could get. A simple, honest life but a life that was the result of lost love. <br />
<br />
And now, here she was with a rather eager bunny girl willing to come back to her house for..., who knows how many hours of sex. No, she wanted more than just sex, she wanted a connection. She wanted someone to love her back. And she would show this all to Ami. <br />
<br />
In fluid motion, Andy got up and picked up Ami in a bridal style carry. The bunny giggled as she snuggled against the large chest she found her head up against as Andy took off towards home, unknowingly their new home. <br />
<br />
A pair of eyes watched from a distance and a pair of legs kept up. Amber, the squirrel bimbo that started all of this, giggled as she mentally marked the location of Andy&#39;s cabin. She&#39;d been busy hunting but had a special spot for her &#39;first turning&#39;. What a surprise Ami would have if Amber showed back up. Maybe she&#39;d even share her new thicc girl. Amber&#39;s thoughts were distracted by a noise off in the woods, and so she promised to return the next morning to check on the bunny and bear. Maybe get some friends first though.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Andy all but kicked her cabin door open and the wall shuddered as she slammed it shut. Almost without missing a beat, Andy tossed the bunny onto the nearby couch, one of the few pieces of furniture in the small living room, and quickly followed. Ami blushed as the bear’s hands were all over her again, softly caressing and groping. “Mmm such strong and gentle hands” she moaned out as Andy’s hand found the bunny’s chest. <br />
<br />
“Oh baby don’t worry, I’ll only go rough when you’re ready to beg for it.” Andy seductively whispered as she continued to play with her new love. But while there was a good spark going there wasn’t as much…, kindling. Ami’s body while bigger than most humans, Andy’s own bear bod made it seem smaller. Her hands fully covered the other’s chest and her fuzzy bunny booty only fit half of the bear’s palms. <br />
“MMM, Too bad you’re not bigger like me. Then we could really have some fun. You’d like that wouldn’t you?” Andy asked, “You’d love to have a big, strong, buxom body to be worshipped by me.” <br />
<br />
“Oooooooh, that does sound good…” Ami murmered as Andy started to lick her body with that large tongue of hers. “So… big.”<br />
“I mean while I love to make you feel good, this is going to be hard for us to both get the full experience. But I can do…, this” Andy said as she stood up. <br />
<br />
Before Ami could figure out what was going on, Andy had grabbed her ankles and hoisted her up. After the bunny was more into the air, the bulky woman changed her grip to hold her more around the middle of her body while keeping her upside down. This gave Any free access to Ami’s pussy which she quicky started to work over with her new muzzle. Ami quickly descended into a series of moans and gasps as she was ‘devoured’ by the predator. <br />
<br />
However, she wasn’t fully entranced so when Ami got a moment, she was able to return the favor as best she could. It took some stretching but she was able to lick at Andy’s pussy. “Mmm tastes like honey…” she moaned out before going back to work. Her hands were busying feeling up the bears’s bouncy rear and thick thighs. She could easily feel the muscles behind all the softness and made herself feel self consisces a bit. Andy was so big and strong, yet she chose to take her home instead of going off to find a bigger mate. Wait shouldn’t they both find new mates to change…? Something was off. Her mind was fuzzy now between the passion and the smell of Andy’s musk.<br />
Andy was spurned on by Ami’s affections to the point she went to her knees, carefully as not to crush her new love, and moved them into a more standard 69 position. Ami for her part started her own task more eagerly in part due to having better access and in part due to the taste of Andy’s ‘nectar’. She continued to play with Andy’s bodacious rear as well and before long applied a few spanks to the large mass which earned a few moans from Andy. <br />
<br />
“MMM YES Harder my love. HARDER!” Andy ordered to which Ami was happy to follow. With a surprising amount of strength is seemed. After the third spank Andy couldn’t hold it and gushed all over Ami which in turn set her off. Andy had arched her back to the point she was sitting straight up so her fur escaped most of Ami’s fluids but Ami was as ‘lucky?’ perhaps. Still she couldn’t live without the taste anymore and drank as much as she could with a stupid grin on her face before Andy got off her. <br />
“o....oh… wow that… was something….” Ami sputtered out as the bear helped her up and into a French kiss, the 2 exchanging the taste of the other. <br />
<br />
“Mmm yes…, that was a nice warm up.” Andy said as she pulled away causing Ami to sputter again about ‘warm up’. Andy giggled which caused all the right things to jiggle. “Yes, warm up. My wife has to be able to go all night long.” <br />
Wait…., Wife? Ami’s head was swimming now but was Wife actually said? <br />
<br />
“I’ve been ever so lonely and you came in and changed my life for the better. I love your laugh, your kisses, your oh so eager touches…., Let me show the depths of my love and appreciation. Besides, going rounds with me all night should improve your muscles. Maybe you’ll get as big as me….” Andy whispered. <br />
<br />
Ami couldn’t process this but could only nod as the bear dragged her back into the actual bedroom. The next few hours was a whirlwind of Sex, bathing, more sex, break to eat and rest, followed by more sex. All the while, Andy whispered sweet nothings to Ami about being her wife, her equal, about how she should be bigger, stronger. These words fueled her lust throught the night as the continued to grind against her new bear lover. Neither cared nor noticed that Ami was indeed spanking harder, that her chest in the dark night that came started to fill Andy’s hands more, that Ami could support Andy’s weight. Neither stopped long enough to process this in the hazy of lust, love, musk and sex.<br />
<br />
That morning, Amber dropped out of a tree and with a grin knocked on the door. She was looking forward to seeing the two and maybe getting some breakfast. It took awhile but she heard the sound of footsteps and the door cracked open to show a tired and disheveled Andy. The bear took a bit to process Amber’s appearance and the fact she was there before grunting with a “Long night…, can I help you?” <br />
Amber laughed at that knowing full well what happened. “Oh I’m a … friend of Ami’s.” <br />
<br />
Andy nodded and turned her head back inside. “AMI, you got someone to see ya!” <br />
<br />
Amber was shocked to hear more thudding of steps and had her jaw drop when Ami appeared. Gone was the cute hot bunny girl and in her place was a large muscled thicc bear WOMAN in white fure. Easily as tall as Andy, just as full and… wait Andy wasn’t that built yesterday? Yes if it wasn&#39;t for the different colored eyes and fur the two looked almost like twins. <br />
<br />
Had the virus that changed all 3 had this level of affect on the couple after several hours? <br />
<br />
Amber watched as the new bear girl swayed over to Amber for a short make out session before their guest. “Mmmm, Anne? This is Amber. She got to me before you honey poo.”<br />
<br />
Andy, going by Anne now, grinned. “Oh did she now? Maybe we should thank her.” <br />
<br />
Amber looked at both of them and wondered what was going to happen to her.</p>
