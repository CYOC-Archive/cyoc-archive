<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The landing at New Zerzura was calm and safe. The landing strip in Egypt was a full asphalt one and was very smooth for those on the specialized plane for the Dinotopians. Looking out the window, Jeremy looked out with some degree of amazement at how much of the buildings for the colony differed from those they&#39;d seen at Maelewano. He wasn&#39;t quite schooled in archeology, but he could notice the fact that many of the colony buildings seemed to be built to mirror the way Ancient Egyptian buildings were thought to be built.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like they have some great theme for tourism,&quot; Jeremy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the way they have it arranged for many colonies,&quot; Heather commented, &quot;but they&#39;ve also tried to provide for other opportunities, like Horizon&#39;s work at Mieni to support scientific research, archeology and local fishing at Vilcabamba, and the arts and humanitarianism at Maelewano. I&#39;m sure this place would have historical research aspects added into tourism. It&#39;d be educational that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy slowly nodded as he looked back to Heather as she looked back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tourism is the start, but they&#39;ll have other economic activities that would let them succeed even when tourism doesn&#39;t go as well... even areas that can expect to have a high influx of tourists,&quot; Heather commented.<br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded. There might have been a time when he wouldn&#39;t have agreed with that, particularly before he learned that Polly might be happy with being an Animalian, even if being rather tall for her age, but the more he&#39;d actually talked with and understood Animalians, the more he&#39;d learned that many of his early assumptions had at least had been exaggerated, if not completely in the wrong. That combined with the revelation that Heather had actually romantic feelings for him had been what gave him the reason join Animalia and become a male Syntixisaurus Rex for her. And now the two were enjoying their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jeremy commented, &quot;though... it is still rather interesting given how different this colony is from Maelewano.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather nodded as she thought on the last stop they&#39;d been at.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a good performance,&quot; Heather commented as she and Jeremy sat on the reinforced bench in Maelewano&#39;s theater.<br />
<br />
The building was connected to the structures that were built to mimic &quot;Pride Rock&quot; and had its fair share of features that made it workable and functional as both a theater for standard plays and musicals, but also for movies. Even in the dark, she could see what was likely the bottom of the screen that would be lowered for movie productions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;and good that so many were able to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced over to see that many in the audience were not members of the tourist groups that came in and out of Maelewano, likely for many as part of some Safari tour to see Africa&#39;s wildlife. In fact there were many that had come to the theater that were full time residents of Maelewano, and this included some of those that were there as refugees from other conflicts. Jeremy had noted that many of them tended to dance along to the music, even if they didn&#39;t know the words in English. Some recognized the song and melody and sang along in their own languages. <br />
<br />
It was something that was rather heartwarming, and to his left, Jeremy could see the family they his initial tour group had met with visiting with Tyra and Rex. A Rhino Guard member was there and was providing translations as the refugee family conversed with the touring Dinotopians. Both Heather and Jeremy smiled at the excitement the young son had at interacting with Rex and Tyra, and Heather also noticed Tyra&#39;s polite and even indulging answers to the boy&#39;s questions. It actually reminded her of how things had been between Heather and Tyra in the past. It was something that Heather noticed and found herself thinking on a bit as they got up and stretched.<br />
<br />
They then made their way out into the evening air and headed back toward their hotel room. Maelewano had many more buildings built for larger Animalians, which gave a bit more room for Dinotopians to at least have some measure of comfort, and this included the hotels that were near the Maelewano community center. As they approached the hotel, Heather brought up what had been on her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it was nice how well everyone here has been able to get along,&quot; Heather commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think the Rhino Guard and the guides said something about the smaller component villages being arranged so that tribes that have historic rivalries are kept separate and thus preventing direct conflicts,&quot; Jeremy answered as he opened the door to their hotel, &quot;They&#39;ll likely have to run some measure of introduction and cooperation... Though, from what I&#39;ve seen while we&#39;ve been here, I think they have some means of making it work, especially with Animalians present for the protection of the humans from non-uplifted predators and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially the boy who looked up to Rex like a hero,&quot; Heather commented a bit of a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he was simply a big fan of Jurassic Park and was excited to see a Dinotopian,&quot; Jeremy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but I thought it was rather cute,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;and I think Tyra was pretty amused by it to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded remembered seeing Tyra and Rex both smile during the tour which they&#39;d first met the smile. Both showed the same respect and restraint he&#39;d noted Animalians in Lyre and Animalia had shown with regard to fans and often curious children. It was actually rather interesting to see Tyra, who he could tell often relished in her renewed youth and was not above letting the world know it, act with polite amusement with the boy. It made him wonder that meeting had been enough to give Tyra the desire for a family with Rex. After all, it seemed to suit many other Animalian couples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeremy managed a nod and then glanced and saw Heather&#39;s eyes looking down for a moment. That made him blink with some surprise as he came to realize something, &quot;Were you wanting a family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the future... sure,&quot; Heather answered weakly and with a small shrug, &quot;wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy really didn&#39;t know how to answer that. He loved Polly, but he&#39;d also come to admit that he&#39;d let himself become to easily distracted by his desire to cure her and then correct other mistakes that&#39;d he&#39;d made there. It was something that had left him totally oblivious to whether or not Polly was happy as an Animalian. Talks with the Whites had only further shown how badly he&#39;d messed up with regards to caring for Polly. That had been something that sat in the back of his mind and made him rather nervous. After all, if he could so easily fail his younger sister, he could also fail any child born to him and Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jeremy managed weakly as they reached their room, &quot;I really didn&#39;t do well with Polly... First panicking over her original disease and then messing with the Animalia Virus illegally to try and cure her, only to turn her into an enlarged Polar Bear Animalian. Then assuming she couldn&#39;t do anything as an Animalian and kept her behind closed doors while trying to find a way to reverse the Animalian transformation and never bothering to realize that she was happy as she was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you had your mistakes,&quot; Heather spoke, &quot;Just as I did... but you had the best of intentions, and Polly does still love you. In this... it&#39;s something to learn from and do better in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jeremy answered as he nuzzled his muzzle to Heather&#39;s and she nuzzled him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, if we have kids and you neglect them... I will let you know,&quot; Heather spoke in  a tone that was hallway between threatening and playful.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... in the future we may advance toward having our own family together,&quot; Jeremy commented as they paused in front of their hotel bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll avoid our past mistakes and learn from them,&quot; Heather commented as she pressed herself against her husband, &quot;and someday... have a wonderful family together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s response was a somewhat dopey grin, as Heather began to fiddle with the button on the front of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the mean time... we can always practice,&quot; Heather commented which Jeremy gave an eager response to.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Typically, a honeymoon did involve a lot of sex. In fact that was something that was often a stereotypical part of any honeymoon, which Jeremy and Heather had happily engaged throughout the trip. And despite some worries over being crowded by too many others on the tour, they had been given a reasonable amount of space, and in its way, their last night in Maelewano had been the most romantic night they&#39;d had so far. Heather liked that, as it was another cementing of how far they&#39;d come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which leaves some wonder on what we&#39;ll have here in New Zerzura,&quot; Heather thought. <br />
<br />
There were some clothing restrictions with regard to what was tolerated, mostly due to Egypt&#39;s laws having some fairly heavily Islamic influences, but it wasn&#39;t quite as restrictive as some other countries in the Middle East, particularly as the Egyptian government had a history of using its own ancient history as a tourist attraction for everyone around the world. It&#39;d mean that things short shorts, muscle shirts, or low cut tops wouldn&#39;t be appropriate, but even Tyra was okay with that.</p>
