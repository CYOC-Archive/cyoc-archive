<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff looked at the evolution package for the Chronivac, it gave him a very good idea.  See, there’s a three men project Jeff has to do with two of his friends in science class and they need something that would wow the professor.  His friends have some ideas regarding the project, but it won’t be much to impress their teacher.  But looking at the package, he knows that there is curiosity as of where the human race came from and doesn’t have much of a theory other then imaging of their ancestors.  That’s where the evolution package comes to play.  If they could devolve one of them or all of them, into their prehistoric state, or all the way to the start of life, it could give them more of an A+ in their work.  Maybe even a Pulitzer Prize!  But that’s going ahead of himself.  It’s a class work and he doesn’t want to have an ego.  He just hopes the others would agree with him.<br />
<br />
But what to do with them?  He can’t just tell them straight forward otherwise, they wouldn’t believe him.  Maybe some proof will make things better.  Then there’s the location.  Where can they do the devolving?  Can’t be at the house, because his family would freak out if they could see Neanderthals.  Perhaps someplace far from anyone in the town.  That old warehouse that the three usually hang out could be a good example.  All he needs to do now is to speak to one of his friends.  Getting on his Cell, he contacted Kevin and waited for the call on the other line.  When he got it, he got the response of…<br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Kevin…” Jeff said, “It’s me, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“Jeff?” Kevin asked on the other line.  “How’s it going, pal?  Hey, can you head to my house for a moment to play some video games?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head as he asked for a small favor.  “”Thanks, but no thanks.  I’m calling you because I have an idea on what to do with our science project.”<br />
<br />
“Oh really?” he said in excitement, “That’s awesome!  What’s the project is about?”<br />
<br />
Jeff knew that his friend wants to know about it and decided to keep it a secret until they meet up.  “I tell you about it later.  Right now, I want you to call Rose and meet me at that old warehouse we hang out at all the time.  That’s where I will tell you about the project.”<br />
<br />
Kevin heard that and said, “Sure thing, Jeffy.  I’ll speak to Rose and we’ll meet up with you in fifteen minutes at the warehouse.  See you there!”<br />
<br />
He soon hangs up as Jeff looked to the computer that has the Chronivac and wondered what to do with it.  He started to wonder if he could put it on his wireless laptop, or a tablet with 4G compatibility.  He has to figure out how to move the program into the warehouse.<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, the old warehouse was abandoned and not far on the neighborhood.  Just then, two people were heading to the abandon warehouse, two of which are in their teens and at the age of sixteen.  One is a male teen with blonde short hair and a close to medium physic wearing a John Cena shirt, long blue jeans, and a pair of Nike sneakers.  The other is a teenage girl with an athletic build of a cheerleader with solid black hair all done up in a low ponytail and wearing a belly shirt that shows off her trim and fit stomach, skin black skin tight leggings, and a pair of high heel sneakers.  The two were Kevin and Rose, best of friends of Jeff since they were young.<br />
<br />
They were getting closer to the warehouse as Rose was confused on what is going on.  “So…” she started to ask, “Why are we here?”<br />
<br />
Kevin turned to her and answered back, “Because Jeff wants us to be here.  He said that he figured out what we’re going to do for our science project.”<br />
<br />
Rose turned to him and was surprised, saying, “Really?  Jeff found something that can help us ace this project?  Sweet!  So what is it about?  Did he say anything about it?”<br />
<br />
Kevin shrugged it off and wondered that as well.  “He didn’t say.” he said, “All he said is to call you and meet with him here.  Nothing else.  I’m pretty sure what idea he has for our science project could count as a pass.”<br />
<br />
Rose heard this and was curious about that as well.  The two walked to the warehouse and climbed over the gate blocking the way.  Once they were over it, they headed to a partly opened door and headed in there to see what surprises were in store for them.  Once they were in a huge empty room, they saw Jeff there setting something up.  It looks like a video camera on a stand and next to it is a laptop with built in wireless Internet access.  Seeing this, the two wondered what he was up to.  They soon approached their friend to see what the big deal is.<br />
<br />
Jeff though was checking to make sure that everything was set up right and if it’s ready.  When he looked up, he could see Kevin and Rose approaching him and smiled about it.  “Kevin!  Rose!” he said excitedly, “You came just in time.  Come over here, I want to show you something!”<br />
<br />
The two looked to each other before turning back to him and walking towards his position.  Once they were with him, Kevin asked, “All right, you got the two of us here.  Now what’s this all about?  I thought you said that you found a way in passing this science project.  Yet all I see is your laptop and camera.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to his friend and said to him, “This is part of the project.  Check the computer, what do you see?”<br />
<br />
The two turned to the laptop and checked to see what he wants them to see.  All they saw though is the Chronivac program still on.  They looked on in confusion until Rose asked awkwardly.  “Uh…  Some bizarre program that you seem interested in?  What is this?  Another one of your weird porno sites or something?  You really have some weird fetishes.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and explains to them about the program.  “No…  It’s not some porno site or anything weird.  It’s something called the Chronivac 4.0.  From what I could understand is that this program can turn anyone and anything into whatever you can think of.”<br />
<br />
The two looked back and forth at the program and still wasn’t buying it.  “Uh-huh…” was what Kevin responded, “That sounds a little creepy if you ask me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged his shoulder and said, “Yeah…  It sounds creepy, but it’s the real deal.  This program can turn us into whatever we want.  Which is why I got you two here.”<br />
<br />
They looked to him very confused as Rose asked, “Okay…  And this is going to help us with our science project…  How…?”<br />
<br />
That’s when Jeff explained about the science project he s thinking about.  “Here’s the idea.  I’m certain that you always wondered what our ancestors were like, like far back through prehistoric times or further.  Well this is where this program comes to play.  In the Chronivac, there’s a package that can evolve or devolve a person anyway we like.  So here’s what I was thinking about for our science project.  What if we devolve the three of us down to what are ancestors were.  What if we step down the evolution ladder to when we’re prehistoric times?  We film ourselves devolving downwards to the time of dinosaurs and show everyone in science class what the earliest of humans were like.  It will be perfect!”<br />
<br />
His friends heard this and were cautious about this.  “I don’t know…” Rose said to him, “That sounds too much like a pipedream if you ask me.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it.” Kevin continued, “You’re telling us that our science project involves us devolving into apes or something?  And with a program you said that could turn anyone into anything?  That is completely ridiculous!  There’s no way a computer program can do something like that.”<br />
<br />
Jeff could tell that they do not believe him on the Chronivac.  Maybe if he can demonstrate its power, then it would actually work.  Looking around, he spotted a little plant sticking out of the crack, though there are weeds and plants growing out of the cracks of a dilapidated building.  Seeing this, he came up with a really good idea.<br />
<br />
“Okay…” Jeff said with a coy expression, “You want proof?  I’ll give you proof.”<br />
<br />
He headed to the Chronivac and started to get into the Evolution package for the program.  Using the camera attached to the laptop, he took the picture of the plant and posted it on the Chronivac.  Then he set it to a specific time period that would make the plant grow.  Once he got everything set, he smiled and said to his friends, “You see that plant over there?  Well keep looking at it and you’ll see for yourself.”  He then clicked on enter and the change started.<br />
<br />
Both Kevin and Rose looked to him with curiosity and decided to follow his advice.  Looking at the plant he pointed to, they waited to see what is going to happen.  So far, they could see nothing out of the ordinary and he’s joking around.  But then, they noticed something that looked a bit off.<br />
<br />
Looking to the plant it was twitching on its own and moved a little.  But it didn’t just move, it was growing, bit-by-bit.  It was bizarre for them, and it’s going to get even more bizarre.  The plant kept on growing and looking more feral then innocent, turning into a tropical fern.  It then grew more as a stem poked out of the ground as the cracks spread around it.  It grew high as the leaves looked wide and green.  Thankfully they were in a huge warehouse, otherwise people would be asking about why there was a tree poking out of the roof of a house.  Soon enough, the growth stopped and what was a small plant turned into a huge palm tree.  The two looked on in awe and couldn’t believe what they were seeing.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to their agape faces and had his arms crossed, very pleased with what he had done.  “Now do you believe me?” he said with a smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
The two turned to him and was still shock over what they’ve just witnessed.  So much so that Kevin responded by saying, “Whoa…  So that Chronivac thing is real…”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes around and said, “That’s what I was trying to say!  This Chronivac can do anything, especially with what I did with that plant.  And if we use this program to devolve ourselves, we can pass science hands down.  So what do you say?  Are you guys in?”<br />
<br />
The two looked to each other and was thinking about it hard.  When he said that this computer program can devolve the three of them, they thought that he was pranking them.  But now that they saw that plant grow into a primitive tree, they knew that he was telling the truth and would give this a shot.  After all, how many students are doing what they are doing.  No one!  That’s for sure.  Now that they are filled with confidence, the two looked to him and told them they’re in.<br />
<br />
“All right!  After what you show us, I’m up for the task.” Kevin started to say, “Seeing my body change into something might sound pretty cool.”<br />
<br />
Rose then shrugged it off and said, “Oh Hell…  Might as well.  I mean it’s not like I have anything else to do for today.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled widely and said, “Oh thank you guys.  You two are the best of friends I could have.  I swear when we pass this project, you won’t regret it.”<br />
<br />
Once they all came to an agreement, Kevin asked Jeff, “So, how do we start with this project?  Who goes first?  I mean one of use needs to start this project, right?”<br />
<br />
Jeff realized he does have a point as he pondered about it long and hard.  “Hmm…” he said, “Let’s see…”</p>
