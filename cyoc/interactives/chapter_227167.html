<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You go ahead Mike; I need to take a piss.” said Sam as he stepped off the path a little bit to find a tree to stand behind. He wasn’t that concerned about getting shot, since he was wearing both his orange hunting jacket and his bright orange hat. So far neither he nor his best friend Mike had seen any deer all day and they were heading back towards their pick up trucks with the hopes that tomorrow they would score that buck each of them wanted. <br />
<br />
Sam never heard the figure coming up behind him, never heard the soft patter of hooves on the soil or anything else coming from the figure. He was still holding his dick pissing on a tree when suddenly he was spun around and thrown to the ground. <br />
<br />
He didn’t even get to make a sound before a pair of lips latched on to his own while his dick was guided into the wet opening of the women…no satyr’s womenhood. <br />
<br />
Abby wasn’t really happy with what she was doing, she didn’t really like taking this man by force, but she knew she had to. She had to spread the gift of her goddess, the goddess of nature and all fawns and Satyrs, Queen Gaia. She had to transform this man into a Satyr to help bring nature back to the world. <br />
<br />
For a while the man was struggling against her, but soon the man wasn’t struggling anymore. <br />
<br />
She expected to feel the man’s penis to start to grow into a larger penis which graced her lover Jules’ new Satyr’s body. She was confused when she didn’t feel this man’s manhood grow the massive size she was expecting in a new Satyr. <br />
<br />
She broke the kiss and looked down at the man she was holding down, he hadn’t grown either but instead had shrunk slightly. The stubble of a beard had fallen away as his reddish-brown hair became much more red. His face also began to shift, becoming much more feminine in nature as a pair of ram like horns began to emerge from the side of his head. His eyes were wide but very wanting as Abby leaned back a bit to see a pair of breasts which where growing from this man’s chest. He wasn’t becoming a satyr but a fawn. She didn’t even know that was even possible.<br />
<br />
“Do not worry, Abby.” Said Gaia as she came up beside her subject placing a hand on her shoulder. “About one in twenty humans change gender when transformed, it is their true soul coming out.”<br />
<br />
“Ah…I see my goddess.” Said Abby that wasn’t the only thing which had confused her, the fact that this Fawn had ram like horns instead of deer like antlers was a surprise to her but since she only had herself, Jules and of course her goddess Gaia meant she only had a small sample group. <br />
<br />
“Finish transforming my newest daughter.” Ordered Gaia with a gentle firmness as Abby nodded before ripping apart former man’s shirt and hunting vest before she began to suckle on his growing breasts. <br />
<br />
It was weird for each moan that was coming from the man became more feminine before Abby felt that this man’s manhood disappears from within her and his scent changed to that was clearly a female. The new fawn didn’t have nearly as large of breasts as either Abby and no where near Gaia but she had a thinner frame and possible a better ass. Which was covered with reddish brown fur.  <br />
<br />
“Do you accept me as your Goddess.” Said Gaia<br />
<br />
“Yes….” Moaned the women as a little farther off Abby heard the moans of the second man whom Jules was transforming respond in kind.<br />
 <br />
“Will you spread the will and love of my light and help me restore nature.” Said Gaia<br />
<br />
“Yes…” said both transforming humans.<br />
<br />
“Good.” Said Gaia as she nodded her head toward Jules who brought the now transformed former hunter over. He had dark brown fur on his lower body with a set of very large antlers coming out of his head. Guess Satyrs could have deer like antlers as much as they could have ram horns. <br />
<br />
Abby guided the former human and former man Sam onto her knees, she raised her tail and her ass toward her former friend.<br />
<br />
“Come take me Mike, lets make a new subject for our goddess.” Said Sam as Mike jumped on his former male best friend and began to take her from behind in a mad rush.<br />
<br />
Gaia smiled, that was two new subjects for her race.</p>
