<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike slowed his car and pulled into an empty parking lot of a local strip-mall.  His mind raced like the engine of his vehicle.  The only difference was that he could turn the engine off.<br />
<br />
What was with that girl?  She had been blond and tall and shaped like a barbie doll, hadn't she?  Then she changed.  He had been dreaming about a new character to draw.  She had changed to be that character.  Or had it been the other way around?  Did she not always have blue-hair and looked like a big-eyed human cartoon?  It had all happened so fast.<br />
<br />
And he was still hard.  Mike's jeans were painfully tight around his erection.  He tried to move it and found it rock-hard.  He tried to think of anything but the Asian beauty he had practically ran from.  Looking out into the night he made sure he was alone.  Cars passed slowly on the road and their headlights cast shadows about his car.<br />
<br />
His mind drifted back over the conversation.  She had said something about magic and curses.  He had imagined that she would be cursed to wear a maid's costume until she slept with him.  She had asked him a question about dares.  He had stuttered something.  She had told him she wanted him to be hard for her.  He had thought he felt a blast of heat in his groin but that was not unusual.  But there was something about the curse that resounded in his mind.<br />
<br />
Calmer now, Mike pulled back into traffic and made his way to the pizza-shop.  He needed to finish for the night then maybe he would be alright.  Stopping out front he ran inside to get the next order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mike!&quot; Josh called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Mike dropped his money purse on the counter by the register.  &quot;Can you ring this up Josh?  I gotta' piss,&quot; Mike said running to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Locking the door, Mike quickly pulled his pants down while he locked the door.  He needed to get rid of his stiffy before he did anything else.  In the dim light he found he had changed.  He did not want to believe it.  Tonight had been too weird already.  But he could not deny the change.<br />
<br />
His penis had been turned to stone.<br />
<br />
It was pink and smooth.  Mike had seen polished stones before.  He had always liked the way the glossy stones had felt in his hand.  Now he was too startled to scream.  His penis was rock hard.  It stood out from his body on its own without drooping.  He tapped it and it swayed.  It felt warm and hard but it was clear it was not going to be going limp any time soon.  And, like any erection, it demanded his attention.<br />
<br />
Play with me, it seemed to say.  Touch me.  Show me to women.  Hold me.  Mike wanted to do all these things, but not in the bathroom of his work.<br />
<br />
The town curse was real, he admitted to himself.  Magic had done this to him.  It was that girl; Jen.  She had given him the curse after he had turned her into a cartoon character.  By the rules of the game he held the curse now.  He had the ability transform people or make them do anything he wanted.  But right now all he wanted was Jen and to get a normal penis back.<br />
<br />
Mike pulled up his boxers.  Tucking his stone-dick under the cotton, it stood out proudly tenting the fabric.  He pulled up his jeans and tried his best to bend himself into them.  It was difficult but he eventually zipped himself in and stiffly left the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three large pies, going to girls-dorm on campus, Mike,&quot; Josh said sliding a full oven-bag to him.  &quot;This is the last one for the night, so try not to spend too much time talking to the pretty college girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Mike said trying to sound normal.  &quot;You know those hoes have no time for a delivery boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too right.  Hey, you alright?  You look like shit,&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem, Josh.  I'll be back in a jiffy,&quot; Mike stepped out into the night again.<br />
<br />
As he drove off, Josh caught the ringing phone.  It had been busy tonight and he was ready to get off work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to speak to Mike the delivery-guy that just left here,&quot; Josh heard from the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, he is not here right now,&quot; Josh explained.  The girl on the line sounded hot and steaming.  No wonder Mike had made a dash to the bathroom.  Hot deliveries were often on the menu; Mike must have needed a little alone time.  It was too bad that only the delivery guys ever got the perks.  A thought formed in Josh's mind while the girl on the line spun some fake tail about needing to talk to Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, how about I give you his cell number?&quot; Josh offered giving his number in place of Mike's.</p>
