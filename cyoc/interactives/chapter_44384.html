<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drew scrubbed his body quickly, eager to get in bed with his new toy... err.. ‘What was he?’ he wondered if I would become my partner... its possible... I wasn’t an object, I was a man, maybe his man... So deep inside of his head, without knowing of it, Drew was building me up and small ideas flooded into his head about what life would be like with one steady boyfriend.  I was having similar thoughts, getting on his bed, having decided on that plan. Since Drew had effectively taken me under his wing, he had also taken care of all my needs. I didn't have to worry about where I'd find my next meal anymore. So I was able to direct my thoughts towards him.<br />
<br />
	He got out of the shower, the door closed a bit more, as he opened the small closet on the side behind the door, it had such things like boxers and night shirts which is what he came out in. He was pretty covered up for such a supposedly vain guy... wearing a clean t-shirt and blue boxers with white vertical stripes, he smiled at me when he noticed that I was sitting on the bed waiting for his return like a lost pup.  I really did act like that, too. Drew was really the only person in my life now. My parents had left me without a word and I wanted no part in any gangs, so I had just managed here and there. I was lucky to have a 'house,' it was only one room, but it was better than a cardboard box, at least.<br />
<br />
	Drew crawled into bed laying down on top of the covers, putting his beefy arms behind his head smelling clean and crisp. He hadn’t bothered to shave, especially seeing how I enjoyed his stubble. Smiling, I laid my upper body on top him, resting my cheek just below his face on his broad chest. I was horny, but the look in my face gazing up at him said that I was in love. Drew was happy to take care of me as he put his arm down across my bare stomach his arm hairs tickling my navel, &quot;You don’t have to worry about anything anymore,&quot; I grin, &quot;I'll just worry about you.&quot; I say with such honesty, it would've surprised him if I had said that when Drew first grabbed and arrested me.<br />
<br />
	He smiled kissing the top of my head as he played with the happy trail on my stomach before realizing that I was 'up' and ready to go. Drew wasn’t so quite sure of it, being as tired as he was. It was only a natural reaction to his touch. Though I would've been up for it whenever he wanted, I was mostly interested in sleeping with him. I had wanted to earlier, but I knew we couldn't in the cell. His fingers rubbed lower and lower until he was no longer just playing with my happy trail. His hands were in my thick dark pubes. Now I wasn’t just staring at the ceiling with hopes and dreams of our future, I was watching where Drew’s fingers were going with anticipation. Being alone for most of my life, I was having an intense moment where I was feeling ‘wanted.’ I felt like Drew really desired me, since he had offered his home to me, and that maybe he wanted even more. That 'more' I was ready to give to him whenever he asked for it. That ‘more’ not being sex.<br />
<br />
	Drew was really beginning to desire my cock. Where me as a man would’ve made him horny, his mind was going to the shaft in my pants. Drew was beginning to show some more 'bottom'-like qualities in that way. Even though he did his best to hide them, they would resurface at times when he got horny. ‘This is going to be a problem later, if it keeps up.’ he thought. Besides the fact that Drew was into me sexually, he really attracted me by the way he acted all the time. He was so aggressive, coarse, and rough, but was revealing a tender and loving side to me. ‘He’s my big, muscular and hairy security blanket,’ I thought with a smile. He started to grasp my shaft pulling it out of my boxers slowly as he started to jack me. I slid over, more on Drew’s stomach now than his chest. I couldn't help myself, staring up at him and his caring face, even if it was on such a rough-looking face as his, he had me going. I slowly humped into his hand and moving one of my hands over to a nipple and lightly playing with it through his thin shirt. He grinned as his nipples hardened, his cock did barely, but ‘This one is just for you.’ He thought, yet still he enjoyed my attention to his body as well.<br />
<br />
	I nuzzled into Drew’s side, thumbing his large nipple as my hips seemed to be moving on their own, working with his fist, perfectly in sync with my thrusts and his pumping. I seemed very flexible and fluid with my body motions, despite my lack of practice I was very good with my own body. I must have had a vivid imagination Though, I didn't need much of an imagination with my face against Drew’s side, smelling him and feeling his body. I knew that my fantasies would always revolve around him for now on.<br />
<br />
	He grunted softly as his stomach would sink in with each breath. I felt him moving his other arm and I was not quite sure why. Then out of the corner of my eye, I saw that he had freed his shaft and with his left hand and had begun to stroke it to full mast. But I decided that that wasn't fair. Giving that nipple of his a pinch and chuckling at his jump, I put my hand on top of his, the one playing with his cock. He slowly moved his hand out of the way, where I took over. His other rough hand stroking my thick shaft while mine tended to his own. He grunted, breathing heavily though his nose. <br />
<br />
	'This is fun,' I grinned at that thought, 'Him stroking me and me stroking him...' I sighed in delight, he was starting to pump into my hand, the same as me. We were both getting into it and I wondered if washing his self was the only thing he had done in that shower. He grunted, watching my hand around his; while his hand was covered in my pre. He shifted his body over as I began to raise my ass. Which he took it as a sign that I was getting close. And to avoid another mess, he kissed my head before taking my shaft into his mouth. He heard me gasp while he deep throated me once again. I tried to get Drew to stop, but not because I didn't want him sucking me, but because I didn't want him making a mess either. With his mouth still on me, I moved myself around on top of him until my head was positioned above his cock. I didn't know what I was doing, but after seeing him do it to me in that cell, I took his long dick and put it in my mouth.<br />
<br />
	Drew hadn’t expected it, but he wasn’t upset to feel my warm wet mouth on his dick. To me this was all new, this foreign warm fleshy piece of meat in my mouth. I stayed deep on his cock for quite a while, adjusting to the feeling. Drew did nothing to force me as he slurped and sucked away on my own throbbing shaft. Each second that went by, he could taste more and more of my precum. This was my first time tasting cum, even pre. I had never even experimented and tasted my own before. I did my best, guessing what would make Drew feel the best as I went along. I couldn't take it all the way in, but that was fine as I figured that the more sensitive parts are near the end anyways. 'God, I can’t get enough of his pre. I'm still full from the last time!' Drew thought as he continued to suck on my cock, sucking it dry. Drew thought that he was becoming a big ol' cock sucker and all because my cum was just too sweet to give up. He didn’t much like the idea of the big tough gruff Drew doing a 'woman’s' work, but that seemed to be changing. I was enjoying Drew’s precum as well, but without the conflicting thoughts. All I wanted was to do was make to him feel good. I thought it was only fair for what he had done and what he was doing for me now. So I played with his cock, trying to make sure he loved it and at the same time trying to get Drew to cum. I felt a low vibration on my cock, soon realizing that Drew was moaning. It was a surprise to both of us, as Drew usually didn’t moan during sex, ‘Grunt sure... but moan? not me…’ he thought.<br />
<br />
	It was a pleasant surprise to me, though. I took it that I was doing well, so I kept at it, trying my best for my big cop. I took in a deep breath through my nose as I felt myself getting close for the second time this.. morning. With his ass clenched holding 'it' in until I went, Drew began to prep my balls by rubbing them slowly between his fingers as it was getting harder and harder to hold his own load. His hand on my balls made me feel like he had set my dick on fire, but only feeling hot, as I could feel the build up of cum. &quot;Mmm! Mmmm.. mmm!&quot; I tried to warn him.<br />
<br />
	Officer Andrew grinned, sliding his hand just below my balls and onto my ‘gooch,’ letting ME know to let go. He was ready for me this time. As a stream of pre suddenly oozed out of his cock like a warning of its own. Drew knew his load wouldn’t be nearly as thick as the first, but regardless, if I was going to put my mouth on Drew’s cock, I should be ready for a big one. Tasting that slow stream of pre, combined with his hands all over my body, I knew I couldn't hold back any longer even if I tried. That burning sensation from so much cum was released into Drew’s mouth, I could hardly believe I had came as much as I was... cuming? I was still cumming! After I finished I was amazed at how much I had came, 'Maybe it’s because... we’re both so into each and this.. is much more intimate than a cell?'<br />
<br />
	Drew kept his lips tight around my cock so that no cum would escape his lips this time. He swallowed as I filled his mouth. Soon enough, he came as well, blowing a nice sized load in two thick squirts into my mouth. I was a bit sloppy, but good with cleanup with what I missed, licking his shaft, all that was left was my saliva. Drew did the same, even tasting my somewhat salty sack as well. 'I could live in this bush... oh I'm just too raunchy…' He thought to himself. I kept on licking, not wanting to stop. The main thought in my head was to make sure Drew knew how thankful I was to him, even if this was the only way I could repay him without any money.<br />
<br />
	Giving my thigh a firm pat, he repositioned himself back where he was before as I continued to lick his shaft, still hard but not hard enough to stand on its own, his cock laid on my face while I licked his balls. Drew grinned, letting me go to town ,though it was completely unnecessary, as I had nothing to prove in his mind. As his dick began deflating, I pulled myself back up to his side and the headboard, &quot;How.. how was that... Drew?&quot; I asked, glad that I know his name now. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he grinned hoisting me up so that I laid completely on him and he packed his shaft back into his underwear. My chin was aligned with his chest. He put his arm around my back and with both hands on my ass, he started rubbing it slowly. My boxers had fallen off the bed during all this, so I was completely nude on top of this muscular cop. I smiled, not caring about my boxers at all, &quot;So, does that mean you'll keep me?&quot; I grin, resting my hands on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I never planned on giving you away,&quot; He chuckled which I felt his laugh through his hard stomach as he continued to massage my ass which, no doubt, was still sore from being fucked before. I turned my face and, nuzzling against Drew’s chest, wondered just how hairy he was under that shirt. I knew that he was covered in muscle, but I had never seen him without your undershirt. But I knew already that he had a nice amount on his arms and legs, and then he seemed to have a beard that grew easily.<br />
<br />
	In five short minutes, I was still wide awake, but noticed that Drew had fallen asleep quietly. One big hand still remained on my back side, while the other fell to the bed. We were now in the center of the bed, where we had first laid. Even though now would be the perfect opportunity to escape, I still had no intention of doing so. That was just a random thought in my head. ‘Maybe I'd remember it for later, if I wanted a glass of water or something.’ I thought to myself, chuckling. I looked up at Drew’s face and listened to his soft breathing as I felt his body raise and fall beneath me. This was something I really looked forward to getting used to.</p>
