<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Leah, if this is some kind of joke, it&#39;s not funny!&quot; Tina shouted, angry and disgusted. Leah was as well, mostly from how she reacted to Tina&#39;s stupidly worded command.<br />
&quot;Tina, it&#39;s-&quot;<br />
&quot;No more words out of you, young lady!&quot;<br />
And it&#39;s at this point that Leah realized she was doomed. She can no longer speak, and can no longer explain her lack of will power. And given Tina&#39;s angry, there&#39;s no stopping what she&#39;ll say or do.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what childish game you&#39;re playing, Leah, but this is incredibly inappropriate! I understand that you don&#39;t like me, and don&#39;t want a replacement for your mother, but I&#39;m trying! Why can&#39;t you see that?&quot; Tina sounded impassioned, eyes misty with emotion. Leah was a little surprised by the outburst, feeling a tad guilty but mostly just scared and frustrated. She wanted to respond, but obviously couldn&#39;t.<br />
Tina stood there staring, waiting for some kind of a reaction that Leah can&#39;t give.<br />
&quot;Well? Nothing to say?&quot; Tina asked impatiently. Leah shrugged and pointed to her mouth, unsure of what else to do. She wanted to run off and get changed, but there&#39;s little she can do without talking, and she&#39;s afraid Tina will restrict her movement too. <br />
&quot;What are y- are you seriously playing the silent treatment now?!&quot; Tina asked in disbelief, and Leah wanted to cry. She tried to shake her head no, but it was too late; Tina&#39;s face twisted with rage, one that Leah hasn&#39;t seen before.<br />
&quot;Alright, Leah, if you want to act like a baby, I will TREAT you like a baby! You will do what I say, or so help me I&#39;ll...ugh, just follow me!&quot; She shouts, forcing the girl to comply silently. Seeing Tina try to be angry was as hilarious as it was unnerving, as the woman didn&#39;t have a mean bone in her body; however, Tina loved taking care of babies, like trying to treat Leah as a baby, and knows Leah absolutely despises it. Put that all together, and Leah had a good idea on what Tina had planned. She tries to keep herself hunched over to at least partially obscure her accident, but it was an act of futility; she didn&#39;t just pee her pants, she drenched it, leaving the entire article of clothing heavy with urine and leaving a dripping yellow trail. It was absolutely disgusting, and everyone they went by looked at her in judgment. She wasn&#39;t going to hell, she was already there.<br />
Tina was grumbling to herself, clearly too frustrated to even question why Leah hasn&#39;t voiced a complaint. On their way to the bathroom, she casually went around and threw a few things in her cart, most of which being diaper and baby supplies---sure Tina works at a daycare, but it&#39;s obvious to Leah that this going to be her form of discipline. Her step-mom is going to diaper her for something she can&#39;t control, and Leah was powerless to stop it. She wracked her brain for a way out, fighting the tears she so desperately wanted to shed. Maybe she could write out a message? Tell Tina her words have power, and just hope that she doesn&#39;t abuse it? The moment she thought that, however, she felt herself not being able; the command was &#39;No more words out of you&#39;. Written words were still words. She couldn&#39;t communicate even a little. Tears now actually started to fall down her face. If Tina has no idea she needs to give her permission to talk again...will it ever happen now? Will Leah be silent forever? Leah&#39;s mind was stuck in existentialistic dread when they entered the bathroom. The private family room, in fact---the very one used to change babies. As Tina closed and locked the door with a huff, she turned to find a sobbing Leah and her anger dropped for a moment. Leah looked so sad and vulnerable, it broke Tina&#39;s heart. Is she embarrassed? Ashamed? Why won&#39;t she speak? Does Leah just...hate her that much?<br />
&quot;Leah, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Tina asked in a soft voice.<br />
Leah, of course, could say nothing. She points to her throat and shakes her head.<br />
&quot;Honey, please, what&#39;s wrong? Why won&#39;t you talk to me?&quot; Tina&#39;s voice was desperate now.<br />
Leah was desperate, too. She crossed both hands over her mouth, trying with all her limited acting ability to charades her way into telling Tina she can&#39;t talk.<br />
&quot;So...you really just won&#39;t speak to me?&quot; The hurt in her voice was evident, shutting her eyes tight to stop tears from showing, &quot;Fine. Then I guess I have no choice. Take off all your clothes. We aren&#39;t leaving until y-&quot; But Tina saw the clothes were removed when she opened her eyes, along with an embarrassed Leah trying to cover her chest and groin. That unnerved Tina a little bit; Leah is so adamant about peeing herself and not talking, yet doesn&#39;t fight at all when asked to strip...yet still looks embarrassed? It didn&#39;t make much sense. But right now, Tina was angry and upset, and felt like she needed to assert herself. She opened the changing station and patted it.<br />
&quot;Lay on here, and I will clean you up. If you want to-&quot; Again, Leah was already laying on her back, sobbing violently as she continued to cover herself.<br />
&quot;Well, if you wet yourself, then you get diapers, and we&#39;ll see how much you like wearing your toilet.&quot; Tina tried to say threateningly, but...well, she was incredibly excited about this. Yes, it was meant to punish Leah, but only because it makes Tina happy. She&#39;s always wanted to dress Leah up like a baby, it&#39;s like a latent maternal instinct combined with how small and underdeveloped the teen was; she would be lying to herself that this wasn&#39;t a self-serving punishment. Tina&#39;s still hurt, though.<br />
She begins to wipe off all the pee still on Leah&#39;s skin. She squirms rather violently before Tina simply askes her to &#39;lie still&#39;, gaining more loud sobs but a stone still Leah. From then, Tina just goes full childcare mode, powdering her, lying the diaper under her, wrapping it up...she only realized she put a pacifier in Leah&#39;s mouth after the girl spit it out, looking at her in vehement disbelief (which, yeah, she might&#39;ve gotten a little too into it). With the final tape placed, she looked to find the most adorable image of a bashful (heavily sobbing) little girl in nothing but a diaper. But of course, she couldn&#39;t go out like that.<br />
&quot;Stand up.&quot; Tina said, reaching into her baby supplies and pulling out a green onesie with a little skirt and cartoon frog on the front.<br />
&quot;Arms up.&quot; And Leah did so without protest, even though she seemed to be crying harder. It was really starting to make Tina incredibly uncomfortable, but...Leah was still doing it. She can&#39;t be that upset, can she? Tina continues, and places the onesie on the girl, snapping the back. She looks at her handiwork, and felt her heart melt. She looked like a toddler! A...crying toddler. Aside from her hair style and make-up (which was starting to run from all the tears), Leah didn&#39;t look anything like a teenager. It made Tina wonder for a second why she didn&#39;t try this before...then remembering that her step-daughter isn&#39;t a plaything, this is just a punishment. Absentmindedly, she stuck the pacifier in the girl&#39;s mouth out of reflex, and once again only realized her mistake when Leah ripped it out of her mouth in disbelief.<br />
&quot;There, now you look like how you act. Now...&quot;</p>
