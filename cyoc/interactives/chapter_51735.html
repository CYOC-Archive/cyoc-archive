<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a strange void, that she couldn't place, Samantha watched horrified as her body did things she would have never done, as it embraced things that not even her father at his worst would do. She struggled as hard as he could but heavy cast iron chains held down her neck, arms, and legs. As as she looked about the void, she saw the evils that &quot;Glass&quot; had done... that the witches had done to the wolves there. Garnett, Amethyst, Jasper, Lazuli, Emerald, Amber, Ruby, Topaz, Goldie, Tourmaline, Coral, Carnelian, and Opal were all similarly chained. She could see Caroline, in the wolf form she had before her mutation into Cobalt, and Lawrence, in his wolf form before his mutation into Quartz, also chained, Lawrence in visible pain because of his arm.<br />
<br />
The deer were held down by rope nets, all of them panicked but unable to move... and the crew and passengers of the yacht tied together as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is wrong,&quot; Samantha said weakly.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in the Curse World, looking out at Big Bad Island, Gomorrah and Golgatha watched in pleasure at both Samantha's and the other's misery and the actions being taken by Glass and the others on the island. But then through Glass, there was something that flashed before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Mistresses?&quot; a black cat spoke to the two witches, its eyes glowing an evil green.<br />
<br />
Gomorrah raised a hand and a small circular image of a sight in Glendale appeared. The image was of Jensen and Kaylee standing near Alice and Abbey with several lions around them. They were planning something... and then in a flash, both witches sensed it. Samantha, Abbey, and Alice, despite their different ages were becoming very much like their mothers. Intricately connected. And through Glass, the witches were now tapping into that connection. And that HORRID glass wolf was working out something that they knew would beat them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That monster...&quot; Golgatha spoke, &quot;she'll twist our own powers against us... leave us at the mercy of that Japanese Priestess wolf! The ugly wolf that killed our sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A curse to Jensen's intelligence,&quot; Gomorrah spoke, &quot;He knows he and his pack are now immune to us and with his present numbers and with that priestess his victory is all but assured... especially if the pride gives him the extra muscle. He must move fast, but he's not rushing blindly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We must stop him,&quot; Gomorrah spoke, &quot;make him rush things... we could kill that little monster, Alice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she is like Glass,&quot; Golgatha said, &quot;indestructible, and with her sister as well... attacking her would only bring out Samantha's love for her sisters and our hold on them will be broken and our Glass will be gone... and Jensen will learn our plans to kill him and his mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We must still attack!&quot; Gomorrah urged madly, &quot;make him rush here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Golgatha nodded, &quot;but not against Alice. Against his Alpha Female's pups...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Gomorrah agreed, &quot;Glass and the chimeras will grab Kaylee's pups and that red-brown bitch will stumble into or trap to free them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Golgatha nodded...<br />
<br />
And so, the Curse sent a mental command to Glass and the children turned into chimeras. Attack Wolf Manor and bring Jenny, Bart, Kevin, and Marcy to it. To an outside observer, the plan was madness. While capturing the pups to use as bait for the Pack and the Pride was a good idea, the witches gave Glass and the chimera no operational plan or ideas to deal with any difficulties... and almost as if they believed that the Pack's freedom made them incapable of defending the pups.<br />
<br />
Much like Hitler commanding his armies to &quot;hold to the last&quot; in places where defeat was already guaranteed: Stalingrad, El Alemain, Normandy, Berlin, and ordering senseless attacks when he lacked the forces, intelligence or the coherent plan to really attack successfully: El Alemain, Kursk, Normandy, and the Battle of the Bulge. The witches in their determination to spread chaos and misery merely ordered an attack, with no real plan...<br />
<br />
...but then as agents of chaos, strategic planning WASN'T even in the picture. It made them dangerous, but it could not make them victorious. And it was in fact their own actions in Glendale that had lead to them getting caught in the first place. The witches were only able to curse the city when they managed to regain enough mental focus to try and gain some revenge...<br />
<br />
... and on Big Bad Island, despite what they had done to the residents there and the passengers on the yacht, they were repeating the exact same mistakes that got them caught and KILLED before. Their own love of chaos was insuring their own destruction.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
And at the manor, the Pack was in no way wanting to take what the witches were doing to their pack mates lying down. Many still struggled with the wrongs of their transformations, but all of them were still loyal to Jensen... or to the Smith family, which by age, Jensen now led... and even if they weren't, they weren't about to let the curse steal their pack mates and their food. And Fran, Darla, and Julie were rapidly trying to get them ready for the coming fight, and to insure that no one jumped the Pride when they arrived. Amy continued to meditate, nearby with Zack and June standing nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know things seem bad,&quot; Fran spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we must stand together,&quot; Darla added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our minds are finally free,&quot; Julie added, &quot;but we have one last mission before the Curse is truly broken...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We must free out pack mates,&quot; the triplets said together, &quot;You must put aside any anger you have at Jensen... for what is coming is too big for us to let petty anger cloud our thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no anger,&quot; Yamato said, &quot;Not at Jensen-Sama, anyway... and even still, without him and the priestess, I would still be a prisoner in marble.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other Japanese wolves agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We SHALL destroy the curse, or die trying,&quot; Chiyoye swore.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be no death,&quot; came Amy's voice from where she was meditating as all eyes turned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be no death,&quot; Amy spoke, as if she could see the future brightly, &quot;the witches are already dead and we are only seeking to render their shadows back to where they were before we began our trek to becoming beautiful... the battle will be fierce. Good shall triumph and all will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Rose asked the white and red pup, sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I do,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;the witches are nothing but spirits of chaos and hatred... evil and darkness... as a result, all of their creations act and behave in mindless, chaotic, uncontrolled manners. NO intelligence or control. Strong yes, but can they win... absolutely not. The witches in their madness can not see that their world of chaos can not win. Not while good lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your certain that no one will die?&quot; Zack came up to his daughter, kneeling to place a paw on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;and when the witches are gone forever... our pack, in its entirety shall return and be something beautiful forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful?&quot; Martha thought as she over heard the triplets raise their all to arms, &quot;has she not seen me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be alright,&quot; Mr. P said to her, trying to comfort the multi-armed wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be so calm,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;He took everything from you. Your humanity, your job, you didn't even get the benefit of opposable thumbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. P nodded, &quot;I did lose all that. But Jensen is still my great-grandchild. Family. I can not hate him. My greatest regret when I transformed was not the loss of my humanity or my business. It was that I had never been there to be a &quot;grandparent&quot; to Jennifer. Now... I have the pups to raise and advise... and I have the full intention of putting Jensen through some good morality training. He wants to be a father? I will make sure he's a good one. One who doesn't let his children behave as Jennifer did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're saying I should stay as the nanny to those pups?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you hate them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Martha sighed, &quot;Not at all... Bart, as Bartholomew, may have had his quirks, but he was still a good man at heart. I can't hate him... and before the Curse, I didn't know Marcy, Kevin, Zelipe, Amy, Alice, Abbey, or Samantha... I can't hate them either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though the curse likely HAS Samantha?&quot; Mr. P questioned.<br />
<br />
That made Martha gulp. She had come to care for the pups. She didn't love them the way their mothers did... but she did not want to see them come to harm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must stop them,&quot; Martha said, determined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. P nodded, &quot;we must stop the curse... which is why Jensen and Kaylee went to the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In the curse world, Samantha shook with fear as she seemed to see her mutated form, Glass, gather six child sized monsters. They looked like a cross between a wolf, a bird, a snake, and a demon. Their backs were covered in black fur, their bellies in dark red leather like skin, ugly looking feathers grew from their shoulders and hips and two forward facing horns grew out over their heads and their wolf-like muzzles, concealing snake-like fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Samantha screamed as Glass began to lead them to the mirror the wolves had taken to the island to use as their own gateway.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We're monsters,&quot; Jenny whimpered, &quot;we did evil to our own employees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart didn't answer, as he was entirely in agreement with Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy will fix things,&quot; Kevin whimpered, &quot;Mommy always has...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This has nothing to do with Mother and Father,&quot; Bart said back, &quot;it's what WE DID to people who trusted us... and to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're still sisters, aren't we?&quot; Marcy asked as she came to Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked back to the reddish brown female pup.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd want that?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
Marcy nodded weakly, &quot;I never had a big sister or brother before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny didn't really know what to say, but hugged the younger pup. If only for comfort. Something in her mind still said that the four of them were siblings... but at the moment her guilt was far higher. She hugged Marcy if only to try and alleviate the guilt she felt... and then she noticed something appearing in the pup's mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice? Abbey? Samantha?&quot; Jenny spoke, turning the pups' attention to the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glass,&quot; the metallic gold pup spoke in an evil sounding voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't our half sister,&quot; Kevin spoke in fear as he then noticed six creatures appearing behind Glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get them, my pretties,&quot; Glass commanded, &quot;make sure that CHAOS REIGNS SUPREME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart, Jenny, Kevin, Marcy, and Zelipe all screamed and fled the room as the chimeras came out of the mirror under Glass's arms.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at the police station, Jensen finished saying what he knew of the island's geography and what he had had the gem wolves doing there. The pride, meanwhile listened intently. It was when he sighed at the end that they sensed a &quot;but&quot; coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't know if any of that information is relevant now,&quot; Jensen sighed, &quot;the curse has seized my pack and my pack's future food, and fully enslaved them... as they would have me if not for Amy. The island is likely completely different by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you know about it is totally useless?&quot; Gill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's why I had hoped Serenity WAS a witch,&quot; Jensen sighed, &quot;not only could she help Amy defeat the witches... but she might be able to give us something to provide additional protection against magic or physical attacks, and might be able to make our efforts to distract them while Alice words the transform that will freeze them and all their victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still have your gargoyles?&quot; Felicity asked curiously, &quot;Maybe they could help if they've done something that we can't counter... I mean, Serenity's already said the Curse is creating and using turns like an open wound... it has to have some knowledge of what we're doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like a desire,&quot; Alice commented, &quot;they desire us to do something... and Amy has already destroyed the strongest of them. They are panicked and are lashing out in a way they think will beat us. They desire to spread chaos and misery... and thus, they will spread chaos and misery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, your gargoyles could help,&quot; Felicity spoke, &quot;being able to fly, impervious to harm... they could leave first and attack the most powerful of the curses victims and either knock them out or restrain them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I created them to protect the manor,&quot; Jensen commented, &quot;and their minds are likely free now, as is the Pack's. They won't mindlessly attack someplace they don't know... and considering what I had done to them under the curse's influence... they may not trust me enough to do anything more then protect the others... they might even attack me for what I did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might be our only hope, darling,&quot; Kaylee spoke to him, &quot;just to be prepared for anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen slowly nodded and then closed his eyes for a moment... and then they shot open...<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha...&quot; Jensen spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've sent Samantha to the manor... with six... things...&quot; Jensen gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
Kaylee's eyes widened in fear when she heard the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pups' room,&quot; Jensen spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;MY BABIES!&quot; Kaylee screamed, and turned to Abbey, &quot;Abbey, take me home, NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don't!&quot; Serenity tried to urge, sensing something like what happened before Julie was transformed, &quot;your Pack might be able to stop them. Do they have your pups?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Jensen said fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;AND THEY WON'T HAVE THEM! THEY WON'T!&quot; Kaylee screamed, maternal instinct flooding out of her.<br />
<br />
She took Abbey's paw and rushed toward the mirror. Abbey, wanting to save her sister soon took the lead as they headed for the mirror that Jensen, Kaylee, and Alice had come out of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop them!&quot; Serenity called, &quot;they could get hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nellie and Wanda both reached for Kaylee as the she wolf rushed by. Wanda managed to grab hold of her tail, but ended up being pulled into the mirror behind the two wolves. The group then watched as Abbey returned to her blue and white dress, Kaylee dressed in something that made her look like Queen Victoria before Albert had passed on, and Wanda, despite her gender, dressed as a London policeman from the 1800s. Abbey took the three steps before any of them could try to pull them back.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a nightmare, all of it,&quot; Gill spoke, &quot;a nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can your pack defend them?&quot; Bobbi asked, feeling some instinctive rivalry with Jensen and wolves... but she couldn't hate him, not with his mind free and now trying to help fight the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must go after them!&quot; lioness Megan spoke, &quot;who knows WHAT they'll run into on the way to the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;They will run into my sister... I want to free her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the transform?&quot; Serenity asked, &quot;the one to halt the the witches for Amy and Paul to destroy them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I have it,&quot; Alice spoke.<br />
<br />
She handed the slip of paper to Jensen. He looked at it, nodded, and then handed it to Serenity. Serenity looked at it and read it carefully... all written in a way that Serenity couldn't see ANY loophole in, and even if the Curse had gained sentience on Big Bad Island... it wouldn't be able to do a thing once its own powers had been turned on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any loop holes? Great Uncle?&quot; Gill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't think so,&quot; Serenity gasped, &quot;I've never seen a transform or dare worded so well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice curtsied, &quot;and now for freeing sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
And in a flash, Alice ran after Abbey for the mirror, hoping to catch up with the others and save her sister.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The pups ran screaming in terror for the main entryway where the rest of the pack was. They didn't know where Martha and Mr. P were, after the end of their brainwashing, but they doubted that their guardian could stop those things, hissing and jabbering in some strange nonsense language.<br />
<br />
Both Martha and Mr. P looked up as the pups ran past. Before they could come out of what was Martha's room, six chimeras, the size of children, ran after the pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Martha spoke in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;After them!&quot; Mr. P urged and rushed out after the attacking creatures.<br />
<br />
He came out to see the pups round a corner while the chimera's kept chase. It may have been wrong for him to kill and eat the house cat, as Trevor meant the pups no harm, but these things, clearly did. He quickly gave chase and with longer strides, he caught the last chimera attacking the pups and seized it by the tail in his jaws.<br />
<br />
The creature screamed in pain as Mr. P then shook his head, shaking the chimera by the tail. After a few shakes, the creature's tail could take no more and was ripped out, leaving Mr. P holding it. The chimera was thrown forward into one of the walls in the hallway,  and fell to the floor, its horns having dented the walls seriously. Mr. P was about to finish it off when a second chimera returned, and charged him.<br />
<br />
He managed to pull his head away, but the creature bit into one foreleg and gored him in the ribs. Mr. P gave a pained grunt and managed to pull back and then head butted the smaller creature in the neck. His massive size drove it into the wall and knocked it out. He then looked up to see Martha club the first creature behind the head with all four of her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Martha asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been better,&quot; Mr. P answered and moved forward, bleeding out of two puncture wounds in his ribcage and throbbing pain coming from his foreleg, &quot;be careful... these things are venomous... I... can feel it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should rest,&quot; Martha urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until the pups are safe and these things are restrained.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. P then powered on. Determined to live just long enough to save his grandchildren.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Glass, meanwhile stood calmly awaiting the return of the chimeras with Kaylee and Jensen's pups in the mirrorverse. Her commanded mission to see that the pack walked straight into the trap that Golgatha and Gomorrah had set. She was startled when she heard a voice from behind her in the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to see Abbey rushing forward with Kaylee and a lioness behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't Samantha right now,&quot; the lioness spoke, &quot;be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass smiled, sensing the opportunity. Alice wasn't present, and neither were her parents... and step mother didn't love her. She could grab Kaylee and take her to her fate. But her opportunity faded quickly as Abbey plowed into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will free her!&quot; Abbey screamed and tackled her sister, with Kaylee and Wanda following them out of the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
Glass landed hard on her back, obviously not shattering, and neither did Abbey. And the two ended up rolling around on the wood floor. Glass to try and torture her sister's mind, Abbey to try and put Glass in a position where she could break the curse's hold on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help restrain her,&quot; Kaylee ordered to Wanda, &quot;I'll see to my pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time, Glass had managed to kick Abbey off, throwing her sister against the vanity mirror and dresser, knocking it to the ground on top of Abbey and shattering the mirror. Wanda, meanwhile pounced on Glass, knocking her down and pinned her down as her paws covered Glass's chest and shoulders. Glass tried to claw at Wanda, but with her shoulders pinned by Wanda's superior weight and muscle couldn't do much in that regard. She then reached up and bit into Wanda's right forearm.<br />
<br />
Wanda roared with pain, but maintained her pin as Abbey crawled out from under the toppled dresser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha, don't you love me anymore?&quot; Abbey cried to her sister.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The pups came rushing out into the main entryway to find the triplets still working out things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monsters!&quot; Kevin yelled, &quot;Monsters!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pack all turned to see four chimera creatures rush into the room after the pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell...?!&quot; Grace gasped as she pulled aside to narrowly miss being gored by one of the child sized chimeras.<br />
<br />
Keven, Marcy, Bart, Jenny, and Zelipe all rushed behind the triplets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Protect the pups!&quot; Julie commanded.<br />
<br />
One snaked its way toward Zelipe, dodging the swipes of paws and kicks of feet, mindlessly intent on grabbing one of the pups, and not knowing that two of its compatriots had already been beaten. It ducked under a kick from a blond she wolf and was ready to seize the faded pink pup, when something landed on it from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my son ALONE!&quot; Pearl growled as crouched on the chimera's back and gripped it by the horns and shoved it to the floor as hard as she could.<br />
<br />
The blow broke the delicate fangs inside the chimera's mouth, but the chimera still recovered and pushed Pearl forward and then slapped Pearl across the eyes with its serpintine tail. It did little to really help the Chimera, as Pearl bought Fran the time to grab it by one horn and then thrown through the front door. The chimera crashed into a stone wall. It was about to get up and return when a large stone clawed hand grabbed it. The chimera then turned to see Frontdoor holding him and snarling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't kill him!&quot; Amy instructed as she rushed outside, &quot;he is a victim of the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frontdoor turned to the white and red pup and held the offending chimera, its bites doing nothing to his stone body.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee rapidly caught up with Mr. P and Martha as the black and gold wolf moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they?&quot; Kaylee questioned him.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've chased the pups into the main entryway,&quot; Mr. P spoke as he moved forward, slowly, &quot;they're fighting the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't get my babies!&quot; Kaylee growled and rushed on.<br />
<br />
She then ran on until she came to the entryway. She found absolute bedlam. She managed to see one chimera being held by Frontdoor outside the manor and another chimera knocked out by Yamato and Nicole, but the other two ran about and dodged attacks, trying to get at her pups, surrounded by the triplets and Pearl.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Kaylee roared and rushed into the fray for the chimera closest to her pups.<br />
<br />
The creature was so caught in trying to get at or through the triplets, that it didn't notice the charging Alpha Female. Kaylee arrived as he began to lunge forward, and Kaylee then clubbed the creature in its back, just above its hips with both fists. There was a loud crack as the child sized creature's spine couldn't withstand the attack from adult she wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't kill it, Kaylee-Sama!&quot; Amy yelled from the doorway, &quot;it's a victim!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee looked up, only to feel the chimera she clubbed sink its fangs into her lower leg, and the last chimera, seeing the one that the witches wanted the most, charged forward to gore Kaylee's backside with it's horns. Kaylee gave a pained yelp and dropped to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOMMY!&quot; Kevin, Marcy, Bart, and Jenny all screamed in horror as wolf Megan and Roger tackled the chimera that gored Kaylee, with Megan holding it by the horns, while Roger back handed it, knocking the creature out.<br />
<br />
Darla, meanwhile kicked the chimera that bit Kaylee in the back of its head, sending it skidding along the ground before it crashed a wall. It was still conscious, but unable to move well as its spine had been broken by Kaylee's attack. The curse's attempt to kidnap the pups was over... and it had failed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frontdoor,&quot; Julie commended, &quot;come in, carefully and hold the one that's still conscious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick, go get something to tie them up with,&quot; Darla added, &quot;make sure we have enough for these four.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are two more,&quot; came Mr. P's voice as the black and gold wolf slowly came into the room with Martha beside him, and collapsed. He was still breathing, but didn't look well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha, Anne,&quot; Fran commanded, &quot;drag the other two here. Terri, Sandi, Nick, Hope, Isabelle, protect them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other wolves nodded and quickly began to carry out their orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you cure them, Amy?&quot; June asked, nursing a scratch from an attempt by one of the chimeras to gore her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;the witches want things to be chaotic... I can not sense that these forms are locked... just trapped in their darkness. All that is needed is light.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will mommy be okay?&quot; Marcy asked to Julie as the blond she wolf began to treat Kaylee's wounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;She will heal,&quot; Julie comforted the pup, &quot;from the goring anyway... but she needs X-rays and anti-venom... which we need a hospital for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa!&quot; came Jenny's voice as the black furred pup had moved to check on Mr. P.<br />
<br />
&quot;They will be fine,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;They won't be doing ANYTHING for a long while, but they will be fine. No one will die... and once together, these victims will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; Kevin moved and licked at Kaylee's muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm okay,&quot; Kaylee spoke back to her younger son, &quot;I'm just glad that you're okay. Your &quot;grandpa&quot; and I need to rest for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee remained conscious, and Julie checked her vitals, all strong, but she looked like she was in great pain, anyway.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In the curse world Samantha cried as Abbey asked if she still loved her sister. Glass didn't, as love was not a concept the witches felt and that saddened Samantha the most. She loved her sister, and she wanted so much to tell Abbey that she did... and one of the chains holding down her arm began to weaken.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you love me?&quot; Abbey cried to her sister as Wanda kept Glass pinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love is a lie!&quot; Glass snarled back, &quot;chaos and anarchy must rule! A paradise on earth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaos isn't a paradise,&quot; Wanda told the enslaved pup, &quot;it allows great acts of evil to occur. It weakens all that is good and just in the world. And in the end, it makes things ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're family, Samantha,&quot; Abbey cried, &quot;sisters. We've done everything together. We joined the pack to be with Alice. Save her from loneliness. Was that wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am GLASS!&quot; Glass screamed, vainly trying to struggle against Wanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that's what the curse wants,&quot; Abbey spoke, &quot;You're Samantha. My sister/cousin. We've done everything together as family always does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Family?&quot; Glass challenged, &quot;what family? Jensen isn't our biological father and Alice is only our &quot;sister&quot; because of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He loves us as his own,&quot; Abbey pleaded, &quot;and Alice loves you as a sister. It doesn't matter if it was the game or not. We're a family. We're supposed to be happy together. Not mindlessly following chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it!&quot; Glass challenged again, although sounding weaker as the chains holding Samantha down in the curse world were rapidly weakening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has Alice done anything mean to you?&quot; Abbey questioned, &quot;what was the first thing Father told us when we arrived?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot; Glass stuttered, a retort not ready for that question.<br />
<br />
She heard footsteps coming, and thinking it was the chimeras with the pups and managed to recover.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter, I won,&quot; Glass smiled and then turned to see Alice nervously walk in, &quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm GLASS!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
In the curse world, Samantha struggled hard. She could feel her sisters pain and heartbreak. She had help them. Break free of the witches. Return to her sisters... she had too, and the chains were growing weaker as she felt their love for her attack the curse's creation... Glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep trying sisters,&quot; Samantha cried, &quot;Please keep trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Samantha,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;this &quot;Glass&quot; is the witches creation. It is not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it is me!&quot; Glass protested, &quot;I live for chaos and anarchy!... It must NEVER end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really believe that?&quot; Alice asked, &quot;that all you live for is mindlessness? Doing things because they cause trouble? That is naughty, Samantha, and we know you. You are not naughty. Deep down... you are cute... you love your sisters, your mommy and aunties, and father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After he took everything from you?&quot; Glass challenged, &quot;shouldn't you feel anger at him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alice responded, &quot;Adam was nothing but a drifter... no family, no friends... only working at the Smiths because of charity. Alice has a mommy, aunties, a father, a purpose better then simply drifting about the country, and best of all, sisters who love her, and who she loves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can't love me...&quot; Glass spoke, her voice getting weaker, cracks appearing on her glass form, &quot;I am chaos and bedlam!... I can't... I... can't have a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that isn't you,&quot; Abbey spoke, &quot;You do have a family. You have me, Alice, Auntie Fran, Auntie Darla, and my mother Julie. You have a father who loves you. Who cried when the curse stole you. We are a family Samantha. We live and love, and we'll do everything together... as soon as you break free of the curse's grip and destroy this &quot;Glass&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Glass cried, &quot;I live... for chaos. I do not... live for love... for fun... only for chaos!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our world tour?&quot; Alice asked, &quot;Our game of dress up? Our dresses we collected. You liked my kimono. I liked yours. You were surprised by Abbey taking the Fuku.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image of the three of them in a Japanese department store flashed through Glass's mind and the cracks in her form grew larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had fun, Samantha,&quot; Abbey cried, &quot;Great fun. Like good sisters should. Defeat Glass and be free... we love you, sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We love you,&quot; Alice added.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
In the curse world, the chains holding Samantha broke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Samantha screamed as her soul disappeared from the curse world.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
In the pup's room, Glass's body seemed to suddenly shatter in a massive explosion, forcing Wanda to let go and back away to avoid being hurt. When she looked down, a five year old glass pup lay on a pile of glass splinters. She was identical to Abbey and if she were two and a half years older would look identical to Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot; Alice and Abbey asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters!&quot; Samantha cheered, &quot;You saved me! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha rose and hugged her sisters. Their love had strengthened her defenses against the curse and the witches and feed her. The pack didn't have the pride's &quot;true love&quot; powers, but love was still a powerful emotion, one that the witches never regarded as something good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;they twisted me... made me do bad things... frightened me... the island... it's covered in a blackish purple storm clouds... and they want Kaylee to become a statue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what they did?&quot; Wanda asked, making Samantha turn to see the lioness standing in their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all do,&quot; Samantha whimpered, &quot;they're making us all watch. They've turned the island from a vacation paradise to a dark nightmare. They made me turn a boatload of people into monsters to try and stop you and Father from stopping them... they've enslaved the pack into mindlessly mating... hiding Caroline's love for Opal... blinding Lawrence to Ashley, Anne, Margot, and Megan, and keeping his soul in pain because of his arm. They've enslaved the deer, made them more dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey and Alice gripped her tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're glad you're free now,&quot; Abbey said, licking Samantha's cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;As am I,&quot; Samantha gave her sister an loving lick back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry if this pains you, but do you know anything that we could use to help beat this curse?&quot; Wanda asked, &quot;It's important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It pains me, but I must,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;they're twisting things. The rules for the Game there are gone. They gave me an unlimited... they gave &quot;Glass&quot; an unlimited number of turns to gather people to do their evil deeds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still have these turns they gave your enslaved form?&quot; Wanda questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think so,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;but I don't want to use them... they're twisting things so that it's so chaotic that even Alice's powers over language may not be able to control them. Any turn used has to come from one not created or given on the island... and to be honest, the only way to really win is to go straight into the curse world... not onto the island through the mirrorverse. We will not have time to free the others the way Abbey and Alice freed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which takes us to square one,&quot; Wanda commented, &quot;Bernie doesn't think this idea of using a turn against the witches will work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It WILL work,&quot; Samantha said, &quot;they used me and my connection to my sisters to learn of Alice's plan... and they hate her with a passion... and when they realized that Alice could freeze them and their enslaved prisoners for Amy to either free or destroy... they sent me and six chimera to grab the Jenny, Bart, Kevin, Marcy, and maybe Zelipe and bring them to the island... Amy was to be killed if she was caught... but I'd think their idea has flopped...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha shuddered, &quot;with me free of it, the curse should be trapped on the island and unable to leave. And losing six of their creations will weaken them... if Amy can open a portal into their &quot;curse world&quot; we can beat them as we'd avoid ALL of the traps they've laid on the island, which once the curse is gone, needs to be burned to ashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
They said no more as there was a flash of light that went briefly through the manor.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In the curse world the witches screamed with pain as a flash of light rippled through their world. Gomorrah was thrown against a portion of the curse world where it looked like an old brick wall, while Golgatha was brought to her knees. The love between Alice, Abbey, and Samantha broke their hold on glass... trapping them on the island and then they felt Amy's powers undo their hold on the chimeras, turning them rapidly back into human children... the white and red pup was exhausted in doing so, but the pain that Gomorrah and Golgatha was far worse, and they knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do, sister?&quot; Gomorrah said weakly, &quot;the one who killed our sister is getting stronger... stronger in WHITE MAGIC!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Golgatha had no answers. With Glass destroyed to them, and Samantha freed and back with her family, the pack and the pride was bound to learn of their defense plans, and with Amy's growing powers, they might be able to avoid them entirely. The panicked shadow of a witch was horrified that their agents of chaos were starting to fall, and she couldn't think of a good excuse as to why.</p>
