<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AUTHOR’S NOTE: Sprsizeme, please play with this concept.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
As Derrick lay there naked, occasionally looking over at Tony, he got an idea.  Tony had been a sweet, considerate and generous lover.  It was rather unfair of him to turn Tony into a stuffed bear.  <br />
<br />
Derrick’s idea was simple and would be a lot of fun for both he and Tony.  He went to the Chronivac, opened up the screen displaying Tony and decided to make some changes to both himself and to Tony.<br />
<br />
He brought up his own stats and changed his preferences to being attracted to and enjoying the feel of a furry man’s body.  Next, he increased his own body fur to just above normal, which would give him a good growth of hair on his front and a moderate amount on his back, shoulders, arms and legs.  He set his beard for dense growth that would connect down his neck to his chest.  Finally, just because he could, Derrick lengthened his cock by two inches and added another inch to its girth, he also adjusted his balls for larger and his Cowper’s gland and prostate gland so that he would produce large amounts of cum; after things took affect, he’d have a nice piece of meat and could shoot several times in a night.  Derrick realized that, though he would still like to play with other Bears, Tony would make a good match for him, but not in his current form.<br />
<br />
He brought up Tony’s stats and looked them over.  Currently, of course, Tony was a sentient stuffed Bear.  His current mental state was one of panic and fear and Derrick felt very guilty about that.  Derrick started adjusting Tony’s plushy body so that he became anatomically correct.  Internal organs, though made out of fabric and stuffing, all there.  He changed Tony’s mental state to calm and dreamlike for the next half hour, so that when the planned changes he was making in the Chronivac now took affect, Tony would think everything had been some sort of strange erotic nightmare.<br />
<br />
He then began changing Tony’s mental attitude.  Tony was submissive, Derrick changed that to dominant.  Tony was a bottom and that was changed to versatile.  Tony was further changed to be protective and affectionate in addition to his already good nature toward Derrick.  He gave Tony an enjoyment of pipes and cigars, but only as an occasional treat, not an addiction.  Tony would also enjoy working out, but not to the point where he'd be a fanatic about being 1% body fat and all lean muscle.  Derrick then made some further changes that would take affect after Derrick shot his load into his plushy Bear.  There were a few global changes made too so that what Derrick had planned would seem completely normal to the rest of the world.  Finally, he adjusted a global setting so that everyone except Derrick would ignore his Chronivac; they would know it was there, but they would have no curiosity or desire to investigate it and in some cases an aversion to touching or using his machine.<br />
<br />
The program was set to execute Derrick’s changes first.  He walked over to the chair, picked up Tony and gave him a big kiss on his leathery Bear nose.  “It’s all gonna be better in a minute Tony.”  He said and put Tony on the bed.<br />
<br />
Derrick then went to the Chronivac and hit the enter key; the emitter read the two subjects as Derrick climbed into bed with Tony and then executed the program changes.<br />
<br />
Derrick felt a familiar warm tingle in his groin and he became very aroused, he felt a brief all-over body itch as his new hair grew in, but was distracted by the itch on his face as his beard grew out, thick and luxurious.  He scratched and played with his new beard.  He was hot all over from the surge of hormones and seriously in need of a good fuck.  He pulled Tony to him and nuzzled in his plush fur, taking in the musky Bear scent that was part of the changes happening to Tony.<br />
<br />
“Oh Tony, all I gotta do is shoot in you and you’ll be back to normal.”  Derrick said.<br />
<br />
Derrick lifted up the stubby tail and began nudging his cock into the silky hole underneath it.  He reached around and began rubbing Tony’s plushy Bear cock, “Of course you knew I’d give you a reach around.”  He said as he thrust into the stuffed Bear.<br />
<br />
He rolled over on top of Tony and began piston fucking the toy, leaking copious amounts of precum into the silk lined hole.  He rubbed his hairy chest and belly all over the back of the Bear, reveling in their combined scents and finally, growling as he did so, shot a huge load into Tony.<br />
<br />
He lay on top of Tony, panting, waiting for the changes to begin.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the stuffed toy began to move beneath him, moaning in pleasure as Derrick continued to jack Tony’s stiffening cock.  Around his cock, he could feel the silk lining of the Bear’s hole begin to grow warm, moist and fleshy.  Tony’s body grew firm with real muscle.  His body stretched out, growing longer to more than six feet, almost seven and gradually, he changed from plush Bear to living, breathing, moaning anthropomorphic Bearman.  <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck!  Pull out and flip on your back Son, I wanna fuck!”  Tony growled out in a deep baritone.<br />
<br />
“Yes SIR!”  Derrick replied and positioned himself as Tony had ordered.  Tony wasted no time; the towering musclechub pushed into Derrick and began fucking as eagerly as Derrick just had him.  Derrick reached up and stroked the new face of his love.  He was covered in brown fur, his muzzle short with a thick dark brown beard that merged with the rest of the fur on his face.  As he arched his back in pleasure and let out a rumbling growl Derrick could see his ivory fangs.  He ran his hands through the dense fur covering his lover's broad muscular chest, tweaking a thumb thick nipple on his down to the round belly.  Tony hissed in pleasure as he reached up and rubbed his own nipples.  Powerful muscular thighs were forcing a huge cock deep into Derrick’s ass.  Tony's beefy arms lowered to either side of Derrick to supported his weight.  Huge paws ending in short, thick claws on thick sausage-like fingers gripped the mattress as he pounded into Derrick.  Derrick reached around and could feel Tony’s short stubby tail as his large furry Bear balls tickled his ass.  Tony moaned in pleasure as his tail was stimulated, obviously a very erogenous zone for the big Bear.<br />
<br />
Tony began to pant and growl louder and with more frequency until finally he bellowed, 'I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!'.  He roared out his orgasm, cursing and grunting out his ecstasy.  His thrusts grew less urgent, his cock twitched and he slowed.  The great Bearman stared into Derrick’s eyes in an unfocused blissful way, his cock still pulsing out his ursine cum into his mate.  He slowly collapsed on top of Derrick and drew him into a tight Bearhug, kissing and licking Derrick’s face.<br />
<br />
“Oh, love.”  He said after a moment, “That was fuckin’ incredible!”<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah!”  Derrick said.<br />
<br />
Tony lay there until his heart stopped racing and his breathing slowed, occasionally pulling his mate into a deep kiss.<br />
<br />
“I had the strangest dream before you woke me up, fucking my ass.”  Tony said.<br />
<br />
“Oh?”  Derrick grinned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah... I dreamt I was a big teddy Bear and you’d put me on the chair over there.  I was really scared because I could see and hear everything, but I couldn't move.  I was alive, but I wasn't alive.  I was in a panic.  But then you picked me up, wrapped me in your furry arms pulling me to your chest.  You, kissed me with your tickly beard on my nose and took me to bed and made everything better.”  The big Bear smiled around his fangs.  “Funny huh?  What do you think it meant?”<br />
<br />
“I think it meant that sometimes, even though you're my big strong Teddy Bear, that you feel helpless.”  Derrick smiled and pinched the Bear’s wet leathery black nose.<br />
<br />
Tony nodded, &quot;Yeah... that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony yawned, “Sleepy now.”  He closed his eyes and nuzzled into his lover’s beard and growled softly, &quot;Love you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too, Teddy Bear.&quot; Derrick said and kissed his mate's furry forehead.<br />
<br />
Derrick thought how the world was now changed.  Because he’d fucked Tony and changed him into an Anthro-Bear, it was now part of the Chronivac’s global settings to be different from what it was, only Derrick knew it though.  Now a certain percentage of men, a percentage Derrick knew was exactly 15%, in the gay Bear community would spontaneously begin changing into Anthro-Bears.  Tony was the first, but he wouldn’t be the last.  It would, of course, be completely normal for them to do so.  One day they’d be a muscle Bear or chubby Bear or an Otter or whatever and the next they’d wake up beginning to change.  It wouldn’t even run in families, there'd be no hereditary link, it was completely random as to which of the Bears would become Anthro-Bears or as Tony and his soon to be new brethren liked to be called ‘Ursans’.<br />
<br />
Soon Tony was snoring softly, still buried deep in Derrick’s ass.  Derrick patted his lover’s bearded Bear cheek and he too began to drift off into sleep, knowing that in an hour or so he'd want to fuck Tony again, and then perhaps again before and after breakfast.  His cock was already stone hard again.  It was going to be a whole new world tomorrow.  He and Tony would definitely head back over to the leather Bear bar tomorrow night to see what was up!</p>
