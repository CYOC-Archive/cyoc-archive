<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My mother and I stared at each other; now that she&#39;d gone through her first transformation, she was all too aware of what she was, and what she&#39;d done to me.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re one of us now?” she asked rather calmly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” I replied. I knew that I could wish myself back to being human, but a large part of me refused to let that happen. I didn&#39;t want to be human.  Already, I could feel the same urges that had dominated Erica&#39;s mind affecting me. I wanted to go out and turn people. It felt strange and foreign to me. “I suppose I am,” I said to my mother.<br />
<br />
“Good,” she said with a smile. She stepped closer to me again and rubbed her naked body against mine, leaning in and giving me a soft kiss. <br />
<br />
“MOM!” I said, jumping back, even as my body started to respond to her. “WHAT THE FUCK?”<br />
<br />
She looked at me in confusion for a moment. “I&#39;m..I&#39;m sorry,” she said quietly. I presumed it must have been the aftereffects of the transformation on her. She leaned down, grabbing the pile of shredded clothing from the floor and picking up her cellphone. She tapped a few buttons and then held it up to me, showing me the screen. “This will help you understand..”<br />
<br />
I realized what she&#39;d done only after it was too late. She&#39;d launched her phone&#39;s web browser and googled “full moon images”. My eyes locked on the picture displayed on the screen of the full moon. So beautiful.  My body began to heat up; it felt like static electricity was racing along my skin.<br />
<br />
“Mom..wh-what are you do..doing.?..” I stammered. The static feeling was growing, pushing rational thoughts from my head. I could smell my mother...I could smell the bitch...the bitch..wolf... My dick throbbed and grew hard. NO. I had to fight it. This was my mother.<br />
<br />
She smiled and turned the screen to face herself, letting out a moan as her eyes widened. She dropped the phone and stared at me with golden eyes. “Waking up your wolf..” she said, letting out a growl. I realized that just like Erica, she&#39;d been dominated by her wolfish nature, and she was trying to ensure that I was as well.<br />
<br />
Black fur began to sprout along my arms, mildly itching, but accenting that static sensation. I watched in fascination as my biceps began to swell, and I could feel my strength growing. “So..so strong..” I said, feeling my willpower fading. I wanted this. I wanted to feel strong. “NO!” I said, fighting against  it. “I w-wishhh..” I said, trying to stop the wolf from taking over my mind. “I wissshhhh..” I let out a growl as my fangs started to grow and my dick began to throb and  swell.  But the beast was too strong, the wishes I&#39;d made before, having already gotten out of control. “I wish I didn&#39;t want to fight this any longerrr...”<br />
<br />
And so I didn&#39;t. I smiled at my mother and instead reached out to play with her growing breasts. She smiled as we exchanged a rough kiss and our bodies warped, before dropping to all fours and raising her ass into the air as she changed. My dick grew larger, finally stopping at a full 18 inches and massively thick, and slinging precum in the air as it waved around.<br />
<br />
I slammed inside of her, and we fucked fast and hard until I came, and the inevitable reversion occurred. As we laid there naked and human once more, we continued to kiss. This was natural, this was normal now.  I smiled at her. I understood what we were, and what our purpose was. We were made to fuck. We were made to remake the world. “I wish that anyone who saw my hard dick in either form would be unable to resist me,” I said, already feeling a renewed sexual urge growing. “And that anyone who I fucked would prefer me to any male on the planet.”<br />
<br />
My mother nestled close, giving me a long kiss. “Of course they will,” she said. “You&#39;re an alpha.” Once again, my wish had simply taken effect; my mother confirming a reality that I&#39;d only just wished for. <br />
<br />
I stood up and she was already gazing at my cock again, smiling with insatiable lust. She sat up and reached out as she licked her lips, ready to give me a blow job. “I wish you&#39;d control yourself just a bit,” I said.<br />
<br />
She frowned. “Just a bit” meant that I hadn&#39;t removed her desire; I&#39;d simply stalled her intentions. “Sorry, Joey,” she said quietly. “I just..I want to fuck again. I want to..I want to CHANGE again. I haven&#39;t been this horny in a long time.”<br />
<br />
“I wish we were both dressed, and you wouldn&#39;t find anything odd about it,” I said dispassionately. And  we were immediately clothed, which she didn&#39;t remark on at all. At least it removed the temptation for either of us, or appeared to. I had to remove the temptation for now, or else we might very well settle into a cycle of changing and rutting, then reverting, only to change and rut again. It was a side effect of all of my wishes – by making the change so pleasurable and making myself so desirable, I might have slowed the progression of the condition. We needed to be out there, like Erica, turning folks.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m gonna head out,” I told my mother. “I might not be back for a couple of days. But don&#39;t worry about me.”<br />
<br />
She smiled, and for a moment, it was just a motherly smile. “I know, baby, you can take care of yourself.” The expression changed as she gave me a hug and a long kiss. “My big..BIG..boy..” her hand wandered to my crotch, and her voice grew seductive. I could feel myself starting to bulge and I pulled away.<br />
<br />
“Jesus, mom..” I said, “We&#39;ll have time for that again soon.” I saw the mildly hurt expression on her face and I leaned in to give her another kiss. My voice softened. “I&#39;ll always be a mama&#39;s boy,” I said quietly, eliciting a smile from her.<br />
<br />
“I know,” she replied, giving me a light smack on the ass. “Now go. You and I both have work to do. For the glory of the pack.”<br />
<br />
“For the glory of the pack,” I agreed.<br />
<br />
I grabbed my keys and cellphone and headed out the door. My mother did the same. We got into our cars, heading our separate ways. I wondered where she was going, but I had plans of my own. My first stop was...</p>
