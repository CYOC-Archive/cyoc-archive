<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly a large hatch in the runway opens. It is powered by hydraulic pistons and you could have sworn it wasn&#39;t there a second ago. It revealed a ramp from which a creature emerged. It was bipedal and dressed in a long brown mantle under which you could make out what appears  to be black leather boots. It&#39;s head was obscured by a scarf and a pair of goggles under a felt tipped hood. As it climbs up your wing you open up your canopy without thinking about it. Was this a good decision? In any case the creature climbed into your cockpit resting snugly in your seat. It issues the command to lower the canopy again before starting your engine at low power and taxiing you into that hatch. Somehow this felt right, you were now a plane being piloted, even if it was just a short taxi run.<br />
<br />
The cavern behind the hatch was dimly lit. Your sensors showed that it was somewhat warmer inside particularly as the hatch closed behind you. Inside you arrived in a rather large cavern, perhaps about 2 or 3 stories in height. There was a gallery about halfway to the ceiling offering another level. Creatures could be seen walking around before pausing to look at what had arrived. They didn&#39;t seem to excited as nobody seemed to care enough to wake up the ones that were seen sleeping. Somehow nobody took notice of your genie riding on your right-hand wing. Analyzing the air around you revealed a multitudes of carbohydrates in the air, many of them hinting towards the consumption of larger quantities of rum.<br />
<br />
As you were probing your surroundings a man appeared in front of you. He wore a blue coat with 2 rows of golden buttons on the front, and sky blue pants with a red belt. From it a cutlass hung to his side. On his head he wore a tri-cornered hat. Everything about him screamed &quot;pirate leader&quot;. You thought that your genie certainly did some impressive stuff, if a bit stereotypical. His hands were covered in light brown gloves. He addressed you, &quot;Ahh another candidate. Ohh I should introduce myself, I&#39;m Don.&quot;, in a strange accent somewhere in between Spanish and Italian, &quot;Where do you come from?&quot;. Your computerized mind raced, but you decided to quickly respond, &quot;My genie did this, she turned me into this plane, and I think it created you.&quot; Suddenly people noticed his genie and she nodded in agreement and pride of her work. &quot;A genie you say,&quot; responded the pirate, &quot;interresting&quot;, before making a cut-throat gesture to the person inside of you. At the flip of a switch you blacked out and lost your conscience.<br />
<br />
After 42 minutes and 23 seconds, at least according to your internal chronometer, you regained your senses again. One system after the other gave you input filling your view of the world around you. You notice that you suddenly have access to an array of CCTV cameras scattered around the place. This also finally allowed you to take a good look at yourself. You were a full F-16 single engine jet fighter, painted grey except for your nose that was orange. Your face was visible on it, looking like an animated painting of one eye on each side and a sharp toothed mouth in between them. There was a skull and crossbones painting on each side of your vertical stabilizer.<br />
<br />
Don continued, &quot;Were were we... oh yes your genie... I take it that only you can command her.&quot;, she nodded again, &quot;Now impress me, get me a large amount of gold.&quot;, putting in an uncanny stress on the word &quot;gold&quot;.<br />
<br />
Somehow your feel like you really have to impress Don. Could this want have been introduced into you during your blackout? Maybe, but it really felt genuine to you. Your mind races to come up with a solution as you notice a rather scrawny pirate sleeping in a hammock tied in between the railings of a corner of the gallery. Seemingly a cozy place, despite its height dangling over the floor. This gives you an idea.<br />
&quot;Genie, turn that pirate in the hammock into a living statue of gold, make him eat and drink normally, but everything he excretes will be gold... ohh and while you are at it, turn him into an anthropomorphic wolf&quot;.<br />
<br />
The genie does a mock yawn while contemplating her fingernails for a bit and directed her power to said pirate. The shock woke him up, but there was nothing he could do. Within seconds thin fibres of gold pushed through his skin giving him an actual gold coat. His nose pushed out and his teeth grew larger and sharper. He wore a pullover and jeans as well as sneakers, the later shifting in design as his legs became more digigrade. His golden tail formed along with a neat hole in the back of his jeans. As he changed more and more into gold, his hammock sagged more and more. Suddenly it teared, sending the pirate falling to the ground where he landed with the soft thump of solid gold.<br />
<br />
At first you thought he had died. Died because of a decision you did... though without you he wouldn&#39;t even have exited at all. However you didn&#39;t think of the ingenuity of your genie. Just moments after he landed on the ground, half flattened by his own weight, he stood up again, shook himself into this now normal canine form and stood there for the first time as a golden statue. His shaking shook out some of the gold dust that had accumulated in his clothing from the fall. The wolf was made out of pure gold. Fine fibres served as a good analogon of fur, his nose and his hand pads had a rough finish to them while his eyes appeared to be polished surfaces with sculpted irises. Yet somehow he was able to see though them just fine. This seemed to excite him as his pants were clearly tenting.<br />
<br />
You addressed Don again, &quot;Impressed yet?&quot;.</p>
