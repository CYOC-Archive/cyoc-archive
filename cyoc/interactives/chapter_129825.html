<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ally didn&#39;t know why Kyle was staring at her. She barked at him to snap him out of it. &quot;Everything okay bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle seemed dazed. &quot;Uh... yeah... everything&#39;s fine... Why don&#39;t we go back inside?&quot; He anxiously looked at the neighbor&#39;s fence, hoping no one else saw what was happening.<br />
&quot;Aw, but I wanted to play outside some more. We could play more fetch!&quot; The thought of chasing the Frisbee made Ally super excited for some reason. It was just so much fun! Why hadn&#39;t she tried it before?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we need to go inside. Besides, it&#39;s, um, it&#39;s getting dark soon.&quot; Kyle was right, the sun was already setting.<br />
&quot;Okay, fine.&quot; Ally whined. She padded back inside on all fours. Kyle looked at the fence one more time, before hastily closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Ally questioned him in the living room. &quot;Is everything okay? You seem kind of anxious? I know, why don&#39;t we play more in here? That would be so much fun!&quot; Ally&#39;s tail started wagging at the thought of it, and she started to drool a little bit.<br />
&quot;Not right now. Um, have you noticed anything weird happening lately?&quot; Kyle was shaking slightly, amazed at what power he was wielding.<br />
&quot;Weird, how?&quot; She tilted her head slightly, not sure what to make of the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. Let me just take a look at you.&quot; Kyle reached over to examine one of Ally&#39;s paws.<br />
She slapped him off her. &quot;Don&#39;t touch me!&quot; she protested snappily<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just...&quot; Kyle suddenly got an evil idea inside his head. &quot;Ally, a Good Girl wouldn&#39;t wear any clothes.&quot;<br />
The trigger hit Ally once again. She saw a dog trying to take off a tiara that someone had put on it, before a feeling of intense itchiness struck her.<br />
<br />
She was hot, really hot. And there were these things around her. Gah, they were so itchy! She need to take them off, she needed to take them all off! She quickly got to work, starting with her pants. How had these things even gotten on her in the first place? Ally was growling like an animal, trying to get them off, but her paw-hands were making it difficult.. She managed to grab the waistband with her canine teeth, but they just managed to rip the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little help here?&quot; she whined to her brother. Kyle was more than happy to help. He pulled off her pants, revealing that her body hair was patterned like a German Shepherd&#39;s. As he watched, it grew even thicker, turning from hair to fur within seconds.<br />
<br />
Ally&#39;s shirt was next. She wasn&#39;t having much luck with it either, as she was merely pawing at the bottom.<br />
&quot;Arms up.&quot; Kyle commanded.<br />
Ally acted upon the command without thinking. She lifted her arms up, and Kyle was able to pull the shirt off of her. She barked excitedly, not noticing that her torso was now covered with fur as well.<br />
&quot;Good Girl!&quot; praised Kyle, accidentally using the trigger phrase. He realized his mistake as soon as he said it, but it was too late. He hadn&#39;t used a command on her. Well, there was no use trying to stop it. He stopped, wondering what would happen.<br />
<br />
Ally paused when she heard the command. Loads of dog behavior flashed in her mind. Chasing the mailman, barking at your owner when he entered, getting petted, smelling other dogs&#39; butts, eating whatever smelled good. It all flooded into her mind at once, before quickly exiting. Above it all, one concept emerged. Her owner. Who was she protecting when she chased the mailman? Who pet her when she was feeling lonely, and gave her food when she was hungry? Who let her see other dogs, who did she wait for at the door? Her owner. Ally looked at her brother, new understanding in her eyes. No, not her brother. Her owner. Kyle was her owner. He was her master.<br />
<br />
She ripped off her underwear, not caring that she was tearing them to bits. Her boobs had shrunken significantly, but she was growing 6 additional nipples to compensate. That didn&#39;t matter though. She had to thank him. Thank him for taking those itchy scratchy clothes off of her. Her master. She tackled him, licking his face like a Good Girl. &quot;Thank you master! Thank you! Thank you, master! Master!&quot; With each lick her face elongated, forming a muzzle. Fur was covering every inch of her body, as her eyes changed colors to resemble a dog&#39;s.<br />
<br />
She stood up, barking triumphantly, happy with her new lot in life. She was a Good Girl, and Kyle was her owner. Kyle looked up at his sister, eyes widening with surprise. Ally had turned into an Anthropomorphic German Shepherd.  Her privates were covered with a thick layer of brown fur, and her head was a dog muzzle. Other than her size, and the fact that she was standing on two legs for the time being, Ally could have passed for an actual dog.</p>
