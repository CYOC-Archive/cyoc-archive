<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What about himself? The book was definitely a prank or joke book, so there was no way it had anything about any reader, much less Andy himself!<br />
<br />
Grinning at how dumb the book was, Andy closed his eyes, thought about himself, and flipped a page. When he opened his eyes, he gasped, because on the page in front of him was his own name and an accurate drawing of himself! The drawing was even wearing the same clothes!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Andy whispered, and began frantically flicking through the pages of the book.<br />
<br />
It had everything! Andy&#39;s family, secrets from when he was a kid, it even said he had five moles that he should worry about sometime in his forties, which...<br />
<br />
Gulping, Andy took the book&#39;s advice and &#39;make any changes to the text&#39;. With his hand shaking slightly, he took a pencil and drew a rough line through the bit about the moles, and dropped the pencil when he saw the mole on the back of his right hand disappear! The book really WAS magic!<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
Wait wait wait.<br />
<br />
Did this book control, like, the WHOLE WORLD? Did ANDY control the whole world? What did that even...!!!<br />
<br />
Still shaking, Andy glanced down to his page and saw the words &quot;Andy is currently having an existential crisis.&quot; and quickly scribbled in the word &quot;NOT&quot;. And... immediately felt better. Huh. Well, having the awesome cosmic power to create, destroy, or reshape the universe any way he wanted wasn&#39;t THAT big of a deal.<br />
<br />
It would probably be fine.<br />
<br />
That settled, Andy moved past worrying about any possible consequences and decided since he was already looking up himself to just focus on that. And maybe his unfairly hot dickbag roommate Tristan.<br />
<br />
And now the book was about Tristan. Great.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Andy muttered, glancing over the page. Maybe because he&#39;d started with himself, Tristan&#39;s page started with how Tristan felt about Andy. And hoo boy, maybe the guy was a bit of a mess. According to the book, Tristan always wanted to be &#39;the big man&#39; with his friends, and he was glad he got a smaller gay guy as a roommate since it was boosting his ego.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asshole,&quot; Andy muttered, blushing. He KNEW that dick had been taking his shirt off around him on purpose! And he wasn&#39;t even really FLIRTING! The book said Tristan was pretty much 100% straight, so it was just to make Andy drool at him. Well, screw him! Andy could do better.<br />
<br />
... Andy could BE better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I got an idea,&quot; Andy grinned, flipping back to his own page.<br />
<br />
Andy knew what he liked. And what he liked was guys. Tall guys. Big guys. And Andy was... pretty average. He hadn&#39;t had much luck finding guys HE liked who wanted to go out with HIM. Sure, he&#39;d only just started college, and sure there were probably a TON of guys who&#39;d want to date him (maybe... he hoped...) but why wait?<br />
<br />
And... maybe did he want to give himself a nice little upgrade? A sudden twitch below the table and some adjusting made Andy think yep he DID like this idea. But how should he do it? He could probably just write whatever changes he wanted in the book and they&#39;d just... be true. Like with those moles he fixed. But would that make it so it was always that way? Or would it be an instant, sudden change? Would people notice?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey, the book is writing stuff,&quot; Andy muttered as he looked down. Hmm. Andy wanted to upgrade his looks, yep. Andy wanted to have a tall, large body type, yep again. Bigger than Tristan...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof,&quot; Andy reached under the table and made some more adjustments. This was a weird, but kinda hot feedback loop thing happening. And no he didn&#39;t need to book to spell that out even though it did moving on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Taller, larger, stronger than Tristan, yeah, and don&#39;t want to get confused about my past... oh!&quot; Andy grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem... show me my growth chart, please.&quot; Andy ordered in a posh tone, and laughed as he flipped the page and saw the EXACT chart he&#39;d expected, with his height and weight tracking up over time, jumping in his early teens and then curving into a flat line at his current age of eighteen. He ticked up an eyebrow when he saw the line creep up another two inches over the next two years. That was cool, he thought he was done growing. Guess not!<br />
<br />
That wouldn&#39;t be enough for his plans though. With a slightly evil laugh, Andy took his pencil and started drawing a new line from his current age. Slowly, carefully, he swept the line back up into a steep curve, even steeper than his TEENS, so that his height line jumped from his current five eleven all the way to six foot seven inches in the next eight months! Lifting the pencil, the page blurred and the information changed to fit the new line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me my next growth spurt,&quot; Andy whispered excitedly and turned the page, eyes skimming over a written description of what was coming. Pencil in hand, Andy started tweaking.<br />
<br />
Stretch marks wouldn&#39;t be a problem, his skin would keep up just fine with maybe some extra moisturizer (self care was important!). No acne this time thanks, MAYBE a bit more hair there, there, and there. Foot size... bigger. Perfect. Well... a little bigger again. He could always fix it later anyway! Bones should get stronger, muscles should respond really fast to workouts, yes. And maybe forget six seven, six NINE sounded a bit better if Andy had any say about it. And...<br />
<br />
Andy glanced down, felt his cheeks warm up, and updated a certain measurement that had already crept up over an inch and moved it FIRMLY (heh) into the double digits. That saying about big feet was going to be true for him at least. Was that too much? Andy hadn&#39;t really had much experience yet, but... Eh, if it became a problem he could fix it. Until then, he was looking forward to growing into that. Actually... Andy full-on BLUSHED and scaled his starting size back down to before his latest change. The idea of a boyfriend watching him start out above average and then stretch into THAT was...<br />
<br />
Andy shoved the book into a drawer and JUMPED for his bed, already panting a little and shucking his shorts off in record time. He REALLY liked what he&#39;d be growing into this year, but in the meantime... well, for the next couple minutes he wouldn&#39;t be thinking about TRISTAN...</p>
