<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up the next morning to feel a familiar throbbing between your legs. You felt tired after a night full of harrowing dreams as you shakily rose to your four feet. The area between your legs was wet and sticky. Evidently your equine heat had returned in full force during the night, leaving your pussy aching and begging to be filled.<br />
<br />
This caused you to reflect on your first day of training. Being treated like an animal was degrading enough, but to be actively mocked and humiliated made things so much worse. Most concerning was the way you had let yourself lose control during your sick anatomy lesson. The way you had been mesmerised by Zach and enjoyed Vicky’s ministrations made you feel ashamed. But worst of all was seeing what was left of your masculinity. The image of your fat, puffy sex winking open and closed and leaking with arousal still haunted you. You could feel it now, sitting there demanding attention.<br />
<br />
In fact you were just looking for a good spot to satisfy the ache in your loins when the annoyingly upbeat voice of Vicky interrupted you. “Good morning Princess, how are you today?” You jumped and instantly stepped away from the wall, whilst also doing your best to lower your tail. You looked up at the attendant with an embarrassed expression on your face, which you were certain she would have noticed. “Ah, having problems downstairs again are we girl? Do not feel ashamed, it is all perfectly natural. As I said yesterday, we encourage our fillies to explore their bodies.”<br />
<br />
You snorted defiantly, not enjoying being mocked. Something about Vicky’s happy and jovial behaviour annoyed you immensely. And yet behind this facade was a more sinister side. She didn’t seem to care that you were a human being; all she really wanted was to see you become a permanent resident of the Stables. She was a cruel psychopath and you knew better than to trust her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Princes,” Vicky continued, “if you behave like you did yesterday I’m sure I can arrange for you to receive another ‘reward.’” You snorted softly, not liking the fact that part of you was already looking forward to it already. “Before that though, we need to get you saddled-up. It’s time for your first riding lesson!”<br />
<br />
You backed away and neighed in protest. You didn’t want to be treated like an animal. You were a human, a human man…<br />
<br />
Your thoughts trailed off when you felt a familiar pressure against your sensitive equine vagina. Vicky had moved behind you and was now rubbing you with the tip of her finger. You couldn’t hold back a low moan as the fire inside you began to burn hotter.<br />
<br />
“Who are you trying to fool? We both know you want the itch to go away. Why even bother resisting?” Vicky continued teasing, waiting for you to give in. You tried to keep your composure but it was ultimately futile. Soon you were standing with your head held low in submission, while your body still trembled slightly from the sensations radiating from your sensitive pussy.<br />
<br />
“That’s a good girl. Now let’s get you kitted-out for your first ride.” With that Vicky began attaching various pieces of equipment to your body. You felt the cold metal bit of the bridle entering your mouth, while a heavy saddle was placed on your back. The extra weight felt uncomfortable, causing you to fidget slightly in an effort to get used to it. Nevertheless, a set of reins and stirrups were finally added, leaving you fully-equipped to be ridden.<br />
<br />
With that, you were led out of your stall and back out into the yard. Once again you couldn’t help noticing the stallions that were eyeing you up as you walked past. You tried to lower your tail but ultimately failed, meaning they were treated to a clear view of your swollen sex, winking in all its glory. You felt embarrassed and disgusted as their interest made your need ramp up even more.<br />
<br />
You tried to concentrate on Vicky as you followed her through the yard. She would occasionally look back at you and give a cheeky wink or smile whenever a stallion passed in the opposite direction. Despite all the distractions though, you did eventually find yourself standing in the same outdoor arena where your first lesson had taken place.<br />
<br />
“OK Princess, let’s start with getting you used to having a rider mounting and dismounting you.” Vicky led you over to a mounting block at the edge of the arena. “Now I want you to behave yourself and remain as still as possible. Horses that pose a risk to our valued customers tend not to stay with us for very long.” <br />
<br />
Detecting Vicky’s thinly-veiled threat, you decided that it would be a good idea just to go along with the lesson. You therefore did you best to keep a steady posture as Vicky put a foot in the stirrup and mounted you in one brisk action. The sudden increase in weight made you snort and shuffle around as your balance was thrown off. “Come on Princess, I’m not a heavy girl. How are you going to handle a stallion if you struggle to accommodate a human? I guess we will have to practice this some more…”<br />
<br />
Over the next fifteen minutes Vicky continued to climb in and out of the saddle. By the end you still weren’t enjoying being treated like a common horse, but at least the feeling of having a rider was becoming more bearable.<br />
<br />
“Good work Princess. Now let’s get you walking and responding to my commands. When I kick your sides you walk forward, and when I turn the reins you must move with them.” With that Vicky began kicking you with her heels. You snorted in slight annoyance but did begin to move off as she wanted. <br />
<br />
Vicky began steering you around the edge of the arena. You would occasionally pull against the reins and snort in frustration whenever the movements got uncomfortable. But after a few stern words you were always quickly back under control. Before long you were walking around the arena quite comfortably.<br />
<br />
“That a girl,” Vicky encouraged, “now let’s move on to the trot.” With that she kicked you harder and you instinctively increased your pace. You had managed this yesterday, but having a rider added another dimension to this movement. Soon you were beginning to tire as the mental and physical demands of being ridden began to take their toll.<br />
<br />
Vicky spurned you onwards with promises of a similar ‘reward’ to the one you had received yesterday. Despite getting increasingly tired and out of breath, by the time you were brought to a halt you had somewhat gotten used to trotting with a rider on your back.<br />
<br />
Vicky patted your neck as she deftly dismounted from the saddle. “That’s a good girl. Here, I think you earned this...” with that she pulled out a large carrot which you instantly gobbled up greedily. “Overall Princess I am very impressed. I think we need to work on your fitness a bit but otherwise you are shaping up to be one of our finest animals.”<br />
<br />
You grunted in indifference as you chewed the tasty carrot and tried to recover your breath. Of course you still loathed being called ‘girl’ and an ‘animal,’ but you were gradually learning not to dwell on these phrases for too long.<br />
<br />
“Right then sweetie, I believe it is time for Lesson 4. I know for sure that you are going to enjoy this one.” With that Vicky started making preparations for the next phase of your training, leaving you desperately hoping that Vicky was telling the truth…</p>
