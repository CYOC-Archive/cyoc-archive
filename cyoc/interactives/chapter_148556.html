<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa had heard the doorbell ring just as she finished testing the robe that her father had gotten for her. While she had to duck down quite a bit to keep her much greater height in her were form from goring the ceiling, she was pleased that the robe fit her fairly well. It covered her and that would allow for situations where the herd that Trever and his family belonged to had meetings in areas were public nudity was forbidden. She could where the robe and pull it tightly around her until she could assume her fursona, which thanks to the relationship she had with Trevor, she had found herself loving. Not because she was fond of cattle as an animal growing up, but because she would match the man she loved.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll really need to thank dad for the robe,&quot; Melissa thought to herself as she began to dress herself.<br />
<br />
Dressing wasn&#39;t too hard, though with the fact that the clothes that would presently fit her were essentially hand-me-downs from Trevor&#39;s mother, Erma, had meant that they didn&#39;t match some of the specific styles that Melissa preferred. However, she&#39;d also compared what Erma had given her to wear with things she already owned. She&#39;d found that while she might be able to squeeze into some of her tee shirts and anything that had some elastic to it while in her human form, they&#39;d likely be tight on her knew body, which even in her human form was much larger than it was before. However, button down shirts and anything that couldn&#39;t easily stretch would be too small on her, which could make things very uncomfortable, if not impossible, if she tried. In that, what she&#39;d gotten from Erma would do until she could buy some things of her own that would fit.<br />
<br />
Though, dressing had also reminded her of some other questions that she&#39;d had about some things that she&#39;d noticed after her transformation. She hadn&#39;t had much time to think that over while at the Tyson&#39;s and didn&#39;t even think to ask Erma about it, even though Erma probably could answer the question with regard to werecattle specifically. After all, she did remember Erma telling her about her family&#39;s arrival in Moon Lake many years before. Erma&#39;s father had been diagnosed with a bad case of Emphysema in North Dakota and took a suggestion for treatment in Seattle. Her father didn&#39;t take the option of being the &quot;family were&quot; and that then essentially fell to Erma, from what Melissa was told, and Erma became a werecow based on Erma&#39;s own experiences growing up on a North Dakota ranch. In that, Melissa knew that Erma knew what it was like to go from being a normal human to being a werecow, but some of her present questions could be something that would relate to weres in general and the same time, a part of Melissa was a bit nervous about asking her boyfriend&#39;s mother about what she presently had questions over.<br />
<br />
There was also Virginia McCoy, who was presently engaged to her father, Harold, and she might have some answers to Melissa&#39;s present questions. Melissa was a bit nervous about asking her as well, though there was some thought process that figured that the questions she had would fit in a way, as Virginia was soon to be her stepmother. And Melissa actually liked Virginia a bit. She&#39;d made her father smile again, and that was pretty much enough for her. And when she faintly heard two voices, one her father speak downstairs, Melissa decided to talking with Virginia and seeing what the overall plan was for the day. She hurriedly dressed and then rushed out of her room and thundered down the stairs. She came around the corner from the stairway to find both her father and Virginia looking up from the couch in front of the television. The television wasn&#39;t on and Virginia had also apparently brought a pair of books with her, though from what Melissa could overhear as she came down the stairs they were talking about their wedding plans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something up, Mel?&quot; Harold asked his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much... I was just testing the robe you got me,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and thank you, dad. It fits my werecow form very well. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d figured you&#39;d need something like that,&quot; Harold nodded, &quot;both of us became larger weres. So... when there will be meetings where public nudity... in human form... is off limits, that robe would be needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And again thank you,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and I see you&#39;ve picked up on some of the wedding planning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold nodded, &quot;we&#39;ll need to get you some formal wear for the wedding, but we don&#39;t have anything hard planned for when that trip will be made yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Melissa nodded, &quot;though... if I could intrude for a moment... there are some questions I&#39;d like to ask Virginia about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; Virginia asked looking a bit interested. She was happy to see that Harold had accepted her and never resented her for accidentally clawing him, and in away she was also happy to see Melissa adjust as well as she had with Moon Lake. In many ways she looked forward to being with Melissa as a sort of mother figure. She could never replace Eliza Jenkins&#39; place in either Melissa or Harold&#39;s hearts, but a part of her was happy to see that there did seem to be a place for her there on its own. As she looked to the young woman, she also soon noticed a heavy blush form in her cheeks and she looked down for a moment. She guessed this had to be something embarrassing or at least intended to be private.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some notepads in my home office,&quot; Harold offered as he stood up and stretched for a moment, clearly also recognizing the personal nature of what Melissa wanted to talk about, &quot;I can go get them and let you two have a chat.&quot; He then paused to kiss Virginia&#39;s cheek, &quot;We can discuss these textbooks when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold then stood up, stretched and then walked forward and past Melissa. He then walked around the corner and instead of going up the stairs crossed in front of the stairwell and went to a door that was to the south wall in the entryway. Inside was something of a study that he&#39;d set up as an office area. It had his computer and printer for when he&#39;d had personal business to attend to or when Melissa wanted to check her email. The red color in Melissa&#39;s cheeks was enough to tell him that her questions were private, as some things like that had come up in the past. He remembered Melissa talking with Eliza when she first started puberty, which made sense. And since he was now engaged to Virginia, he figured it would also make sense for Melissa to ask questions to Virginia about various things that a daughter couldn&#39;t always talk about with her father. He wouldn&#39;t hear things that well in the study, but he would be able to tell when they finished, and he&#39;d wait there until then. After all, the dinner at the Tysons would be in the evening and thus there would be plenty of time to discuss the textbooks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if this is getting in the way of anything,&quot; Melissa said slowly.<br />
<br />
Virginia&#39;s eyes settled over to the two sample textbooks she had to choose from. She&#39;d been eager to go over them with Harold, as while she did know the other social studies teachers at Moon Lake High School and a few of the faculty at the college, it wasn&#39;t always close enough to get some outside looks at it. Harold had actually provided that by being so close by and interested in history specifically, and she&#39;d originally planned to use that to at least build a platonic friendship, show the Jenkins family that being weres wasn&#39;t a bad thing and neither would befriending them. And it had been for that reason why she&#39;d come to talk with Harold on the day of the fight with Alice that lead to Harold being scratched. Sometimes it seemed like the discussion over those textbooks was being put off by something, which could be frustrating, but life was always like that. She moved to set the books on the coffee table in front of her and then patted on the cushion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem, Melissa,&quot; Virginia answered, &quot;I&#39;d suppose there will be many things that will be in a bit of flux over the next few days... With my and your father&#39;s wedding coming up and you becoming a werecow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are you liking it?&quot; Virginia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprisingly... I&#39;m LOVING it,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;granted... I was never a farm girl, and to some extent, based on the guidebook... I&#39;d think that werecows might be a bit oversized in some departments, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia nodded. Her focus when she became a were was after meeting a lesbian weretigress who worked for the Middle School, and while she was with a male weretiger for her transformation, her interest had been drawn to weretigers, primarily for a lot of their athleticism and to some degree the self confidence that many of them had. But like many new Moon Lake residents, she&#39;d gotten enough information on other weres to at least know the basics. In this, Virginia did know that when it came to breasts, werecows were well more than a handful in that department, and the exact size would then depend on what type of cow the werecow&#39;s fursona was based on.<br />
<br />
&quot;But still... I&#39;m loving it,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;Trevor has meant that much... I&#39;m surprised at how fast it&#39;s been... but at the same time, I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s been fast. I&#39;ll gladly be a dairy werecow to be with him... marry him someday... have kids... and grow old with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very... happy ever after image you have going,&quot; Virginia commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it...&quot; Melissa admitted, &quot;everything around it just seems to feel that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel the same way around your dad,&quot; Virginia smiled softly, &quot;So... what is it that you&#39;re nervous over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa blushed again and looked down for a moment and let out a heavy sigh before she answered. She lifted her head and looked up to Virginia, &quot;well... it&#39;s related to some of the changes in my human form that have occurred. Some are fairly nice... I&#39;m not complaining about the added muscle tone and curves... Different from how I was built before, but not bad. However there are points where I have a few questions... and even they may not be bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia nodded, &quot;Go ahead...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you see... I noticed this a bit more when I showered this morning and checked the robe my dad gave me to wear in my werecow form,&quot; Melissa answered slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve always tried to keep myself trimmed and all that... I don&#39;t want to go out in a tank top and show that I have a lot of body hair there... or in other places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now it&#39;s thicker there now that you&#39;re a were,&quot; Virginia surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa admitted looking down for a moment, &quot;and that has had me a bit nervous... I mean... if I shave it or trim it now, will it all just come back the next time I change? I suppose it&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. I&#39;d just like to know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia gave a small smile and patted Melissa&#39;s back. It strangely gave her a sort of parental feel to the whole conversation and she was glad that Melissa had came to her. She hoped her answer would suffice.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of what you&#39;re experiencing is fairly typical,&quot; Virginia said slowly, &quot;at least with mammalian based weres...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mammalian?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;As opposed to weremers who are either more fish based or mythical based,&quot; Virginia explained, &quot;I&#39;ve never fully understood on how the werevirus has included weremers and that they would look like the typical mermaid or merman in their were form... but since I became a weretiger, that was never really something I decided to figure out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for weres who&#39;s fursona is based on mammals,&quot; Virginia continued and pointed to themselves, &quot;be they based on the South Chinese Tiger or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine is on the Canadienne breed of dairy cow,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since our fursonas are based on mammals,&quot; Virginia nodded, &quot;that initial transformation will trigger a bit of a hormone rush as things change. I&#39;ve been told its part of what enables us to control the transformation after the first transformation, and that can trigger a rapid increase in certain features, like body hair... But that&#39;s all in relation to the initial transformation. Once that&#39;s done, things will stabilize a bit.  You might have to perform a bit more maintenance than you did in the past... but it won&#39;t be something where you shave, transform and then turn back and find you need to shave again. It may grow a bit faster than it would for a normal human, but not too far beyond the human norm. So you shouldn&#39;t have too much to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a relief,&quot; Melissa said a bit weakly.<br />
<br />
Virginia smiled again, though this time it was more playful, &quot;and if this was something that would be a big concern... your dad would have to shave off his beard after every transformation. He hasn&#39;t had to do that more than once a day, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa chuckled a bit at that. She knew that Virginia had gotten her father to consider growing a goatee, but since he became a weretiger, he&#39;d remained fairly clean shaven and so far as she&#39;d been able to tell he&#39;d only shaved once a day. That was ultimately a relief as it eased some of her questions, which she was pleased with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that all you had?&quot; Virginia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;what are you and dad looking into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now... looking into some textbooks that the school might use next year,&quot; Virginia answered, &quot;shouldn&#39;t take too terribly long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to go on a shopping trip after?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;I might need new clothes for the wedding and I&#39;m sure dad would love the company while I&#39;m trying something on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia could only chuckle at that, &quot;that will have to depend on what the schedule you and your father have with regard to the day and this dinner to introduce your dad to Trevor&#39;s parents.&quot;</p>
