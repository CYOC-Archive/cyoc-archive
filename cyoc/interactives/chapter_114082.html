<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Anything for me to look over,” Lance giving ace reporter Ella Alyn a bit of a scare.<br />
“Christ almighty,” Ella looking shocked; “I didn’t hear you approach.”<br />
“The advantages of being a were-panther,” Lance chuckling; “like all other felines, we are light on our toes.”<br />
“Yet you smell like the bottom end of a whiskey bottle,” Ella wrinkling her nose; her acute were sense of smell picking up liquor on Lance.<br />
“I didn’t drink whiskey last night,” Lance sitting in a chair next to Ella; “I did get plastered drinking beer with my brother and brother in law.”<br />
“That shits not good for you,” Ella commenting; “why destroy your body with that garbage?”<br />
“It was a rare opportunity to bond with my brother while getting him to help me prep a nursery,” Lance chuckling; “the suffering afterwards was worth it. Although Lila,” Lance rubbing his still sore cheek; “felt the need to add to my pain.”<br />
<br />
Ella laughs as she gives Lance a brief overview on what she has so far prepared for her expose coming Tuesday regarding Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya Adaeze. Lance smiling as he likes what he is seeing and puts the rough draft down.<br />
“Make sure you clearly cite your sources on this one,” Lance speaking; “I want zero chances for Jack and Kenya to launch a libel suit against us.”<br />
“Don’t worry,” Ella answering; “I have those covered six ways to Sunday.”<br />
“Good,” Lance nodding; “now for the next bit, yet I’m surprised you are the only one here. Especially after what happened last night.”<br />
What happened last night,” Ella looking up from her computer.<br />
<br />
Lance goes into what he knows regarding some of Freddie “the shark” Parker’s men breaking into the Knight estate. Filling Ella in on the fact that apart that his niece with the help of her friends was babysitting some children when the men broke in. Three dead and one in jail.<br />
“I take it Benton is on the war path with this Frederick Parker,” Ella asking; “why is the man in town anyways?”<br />
“Because his son shot Peter Talbot Friday evening,” Lance answers; “all for a 66 mustang. Freddie is here to try and get the kid out of jail. Problem is, Daniel Parker has a few warrants for his arrest and the FBI want to flip him for their RICO case against Frederick”<br />
“The Parker’s picked their enemies poorly then,” Ella chuckling; “this mobster going to war with the were-lion king and a multi-billionaire were-panther?”<br />
“Freddie’s days are numbered,” Lance commenting; “with Benton owning the town’s only motel, the man is going to find looking for a place to hole up difficult. No one in this town will put the man up that’s for certain. Believe it or not the Talbots are well liked and looked fondly upon.”<br />
“I take it you want the articles on the Parker’s,” Ella looking at her boss.<br />
“You’re the only one here,” Lance looking around the bullpen; “we need something for tomorrow to give context as to why coded messages and were-alerts are being broadcasted.”<br />
“Well it’s a good thing I got my expose nearly finished then,” Ella giving Lance a print out of the large article to proof read; “I’ll get a hold of my police contact and try and get more information regarding last night’s home invasion.”<br />
“About that,” Lance getting up; “with the exception of the cubs my niece was minding and the intruders, everyone was in their fursona. And two of the intruders were killed by minors; stick to Daniel Parker and his attempted murder of Peter Talbot,” Lance heading to his office; “I’ll work on the home invasion article after I read your expose here.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Jack Crawford was up early; already in his study yet staring out the windows of his Seattle condo. The were-panther holding in his paw the business card of Wang Technological Consortium; the same card that was on Riley when he found the were-rat bloodied and broken on his doorstep. Fuming that the two white were-tigers are once again interfering in his plans.<br />
<br />
Jack Crawford was the son of Joseph Crawford. The man that joined forces with Anton Knight to form Crawford and Knight decades ago. Through the years the company grew and prospered. Yet when Benton Knight took over for his father, the Crawford’s were shocked to find themselves frozen out of the business they helped build. Denied his birthright as Benton quickly rebranded the company to Knight Industries; Jack has for years waited for his opportunity to strike back and take what was rightfully stolen from him.<br />
<br />
His plan to wrest Crawford computers stymied as he found out that Benton kept the subsidiary private and unable to gain ownership. Jack still has no ideal that the computer company is part of Frieda’s trust still safely tucked away in Lance’s office safe. Jack’s other plan was to convince the shareholders that he was a better fit to run the company after managing to acquire voting stock of the company. Jack knew it was going to be an uphill battle after finding out that Far and Kai, the CEO’s of Wang Technological Corporation refusing to help; even going so far as to side with Benton, a man that the two at the time had serious issues with. But what pissed Jack off was Anton Knight showing up at the shareholders meeting in New York and convincing everyone that Benton was still of sound mind, despite the medical issues that Jack purposely leaked. Benton’s bi-polar disorder did not dissuade people from voting for the man.<br />
<br />
Now Jack’s latest attempt to take over Knight Industries is in jeopardy. Knowing what Riley knew of his plans; Jack had to act fast after Kenya’s election announcement. Confident that she will win; Jack had no idea that his wife’s past will rear its ugly head and really mess with his plans.<br />
“Once you are mayor Kenya,” Jack sighs; “everything will fall into place.”<br />
<br />
Jack turns around to head back to his bedroom; seeing his wife sleeping soundly, Jack purrs as the were-panther crawls back in to join her. Running his black furred paw all over Kenya’s body; taking care to explore every curve, flexing his retractable claws to tickle and tease her in the spots he has found sensitive to her.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before the were-panthress growls and stirs; seeing her mate waking her up and his pink member at full salute, Kenya murmurs as she looks at Jack longingly.<br />
“Usually it’s me trying to get you up for a round of hot sex,” Kenya giving Jack a loving lick; “what’s on your mind?”<br />
“You,” Jack growling seductively; “I have you on my mind my love. Your voice, your eyes, the whiskers on you muzzle,” Jack climbing on top of Kenya and placing his paws on her shoulders; “your sexy smell and lovely body.”<br />
<br />
“Well what are you waiting for,” Kenya opening up her legs and exposing her fur lined sex; “let me feel your prick probe me good.”<br />
“Oh I intend to,” Jack growling as he slowly inserts his feline member in to Kenya; parting her tunnel as he starts thrusting. Feeling his steely rod being clamped on and caressed as Kenya eagerly wraps her legs around Jack; determined to keep him from getting cold paws and pulling out before he releases his warm seed.<br />
<br />
With arms entwined and muzzles nipping each other as their bodies are pressed upon each other; Kenya instinctively arches her back as she can feel her body explode. Her sex gushing fluids as it sucks on Jack’s barbed prick; Feeling the barbs flex and dig in as he roars, releasing his hot seed into her hungry womb. Both pant and stare at each other as they enjoy their respective climaxes. Neither wanting to let the other go from their sexual position, as they enjoy their recent coupling.<br />
<br />
Hearing a knock on the door; both growl as Jack’s butler enters. Seeing the couple in their fursona’s and currently “occupied”; the man apologises profusely but informs them that the limo is ready to take them to Moon Lake.<br />
“Guess that means we need to get ready,” Jack sighing.<br />
“To hell with getting dressed,” Kenya purring; “lets keep this moment going all the way to my house.”<br />
“But what I hear is the town is under a were-alert,” Jack slowly separating himself from Kenya; “we need to be in our human forms and fully dressed.”<br />
“You never got dressed in a limo before,” Kenya grinning; baring her large canines as she slowly approached her husband eager for another round of rutting.<br />
“Sadly darling,” Jack defuring and putting on a suit; “our driver is a normal. Him seeing us in our fursona…”<br />
“Fine,” Kenya pouting; “but don’t think I’m not going to rip that suit off you the moment we enter my Moon lake residence.”<br />
“Good thing I have a suitcase full of extras,” Jack smiling; “now get dressed.”</p>
