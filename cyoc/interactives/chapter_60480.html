<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Howard arrived at Bandhavgarh Cabin the next morning while Molly was getting ready for her day of work. She was busy cooking breakfast and I was the one to answer the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, sir,&quot; I said respectfully.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded, &quot;Hopefully things will quiet down for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to hand it to your old man,&quot; Officer Howard commented, &quot;he embarrassed the whole lot of them with his speech.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He taught me everything I know about right and wrong,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully that'll make you a good man to have,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;but it would appear that the only &quot;R.A.M.&quot; members are the two council members that are personal friends of Mr. Beauregard's. The rest went along with them because they thought there was a legitimate problem with you and Molly... that you were being threatening to people and killing their cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they told you all this?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what I overheard while they had me remain behind to discuss how to handle the prospect of what to do if your future children carry this &quot;Animatrix Retrovirus&quot;,&quot; Officer Howard told me, &quot;and Beauregard's been a slick customer for years. Not in the sense of getting out of trouble, but being able to get what he wants without anyone realizing exactly WHAT he's doing. And the ones that aren't R.A.M. members just went along with it thinking there was a legitimate problem. They never stopped to think WHY they were being urged to &quot;deal&quot; with you and Molly. Your dad's little speech was sort of an eye opener for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like good news,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be, even if it makes certain things difficult,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;which is why I am here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George, who is it?&quot; Molly asked from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Officer Howard, dear,&quot; I called back to her, &quot;You might want to come out and hear this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got eggs and ham on the skillet!&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Come into the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want some breakfast?&quot; I turned to Officer Howard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already eaten,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;but I can tag along.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and lead him into our kitchen where Molly was keeping an eye on breakfast... or what would be part of it at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what brings you to Bandhavgarh, today, Officer Howard?&quot; Molly inquired politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly a report on what is expected from you and any offspring you may have,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;it's largely the statutes they had me working with the Council on last night after you left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did that go?&quot; Molly wondered curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the most part, I don't think they're going to get anything that will allow them to &quot;get rid of you&quot; through voting... not this year anyway,&quot; Officer Howard began, &quot;but I'm not going to lie that they are concerned about you possibly turning Columbia Falls into a town of tiger people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're both equally concerned,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we don't HAVE to give blood, and George is the only one that I'll be sleeping with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about in the long term?&quot; Officer Howard inquired, &quot;what if you have children. That is what they're concerned about. You can't guarantee that they won't take interest in having relationships with others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded. We both agreed that we'd have to educate our children about their &quot;condition&quot; to prevent the accidental transformation of people, but if they did have legitimate worries, it might be better to allow those worries to be alleviated.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the present statute, neither of you can give blood, unless it is to each other or to your children,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;and they want your children to present a written and dated explanation of the consequences of having sex with them to their respective partner, and the partner is to hand in a written acceptance to the police first before they can go a head and do &quot;it&quot;. I know it sounds rough and probably unnecessary, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be better then R.A.M. voting to have us shot if we don't leave,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father-in-law has seen to that,&quot; Officer Howard chuckled, &quot;they won't be voting you out this year and that will allow things to quiet down. If the heat stops simmering, this group against you might simply run out of steam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; I nodded, &quot;we can only hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded, &quot;again, thank your father for me... I've got to get back to work, so I can't be here to see him off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; I nodded, &quot;sir, what about my uniform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your new uniforms will be in tomorrow,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;I doubt you'll have shoes, but considering that you, Molly, and Leona do fine barefoot, I don't think that'll be an issue... the big thing for you today, George, is that you need to see Doc Stimson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc Stimson?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a local vet... and I'm sorry, but he's the only one that was willing to take an appointment for you or Molly... and even if the clinic did take you in... Doc Stimson is the only one who has the rabies vaccine that you will definitely need to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got me an appointment?&quot; I asked, to surprised to be depressed over the fact that the only one who would see me was a person who likely spent much of his time seeing the area ranchers' cattle and horses as well as dogs and cats if he had the rabies vaccine on hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Had to,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;I don't want to lose you after we've finally made enough progress to put you on duty. He's on the west end of town, you can't miss him. You'll be expected at about three PM.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I managed to shrug.<br />
<br />
I moved to follow him to the door, but he turned and held up his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can go out on my own,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;You and Molly have a good day, and tell your father thank you for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, and as he left I sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, George,&quot; Molly came and hugged me from behind, nuzzling one shoulder, &quot;I had to see a zoo vet when I was transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, remembering what she had told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt he's going to be familiar with diseases that threaten tigers though,&quot; I commented, &quot;now, if we were Holsteins, he'd probably know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, moo to you too,&quot; Molly groaned.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
My parents and Leona didn't get up until close to seven thirty. I wondered how Leona had slept through Officer Howard's visit, but I wasn't about to concern myself with what didn't happen. Leona was likely just a heavy sleeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, son,&quot; Jacob said as he came down the stairs fully dressed and carrying his bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Molly?&quot; my mother asked coming down the stairs behind Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's gone in to work already,&quot; I answered, &quot;she's sorry she couldn't stay to see you off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, son,&quot; Jacob answered, &quot;the two of you are starting a life of your own out here. Things haven't been easy, but I think you'll do fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I admitted, &quot;and Officer Howard thanks you for all your help, dad. Your speech last night apparently had a great affect on the City Council.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just gave them my mind and how I honestly saw things,&quot; Jacob shrugged, &quot;of course, it doesn't hurt that I am well outside their jurisdiction and they can not engineer some reason to fire me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but you helped Molly and I out a lot,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
Jacob sighed and looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn't HAVE to do what I did last night,&quot; Jacob said, &quot;treating you and Molly with respect should have been second nature to them. And from what I've seen here, and from you and Molly have told me, they've gone out of their way to try and make your lives miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still helped Molly and I out, and I thank you for it,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jacob said and put one arm around me and patted my back, &quot;your mother and I love you, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll let us know when you have kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM!&quot; I practically blushed, though I doubt anyone could see through the fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a fair question,&quot; my mother defended herself, &quot;and you know that all I want for you and Molly is that you are happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and you know Molly and I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I make breakfast for you before you all head out?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't mind eating before leaving,&quot; Leona commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We intended to get something on the way, but if you're going cook something for Leona, we'll eat here,&quot; Jacob spoke, &quot;and we can discuss some things before leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have some ham and eggs ready in a jiffy,&quot; I told them.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
My parents left with Leona in the back seat shortly after breakfast. The parting was quiet and loving, and as much as I'd like to have my folks around, they HAD to go back to their home. Jacob had his work to get back to, and Leona was also likely expected to return to complete her probation. I said goodbye and waved them off when then left. As their car went down the road, I was left on my own for the time being while Molly was working.<br />
<br />
I couldn't lounge around all day as I had been given an appointment with the local vet. I didn't like the fact that the only doctor who would see me was a vet, but then, it was unlikely that a human clinic would carry the vaccines I needed now. All I could really do was accept that I would need to see a vet for this.<br />
<br />
And eventually as the day moved into the early afternoon hours, I made my way into town. I gave myself the extra time to allow me to find the clinic that this &quot;Doc Stimson&quot; ran. It turned out to be rather easy to find. It was on the western most edge of town near a few stores that sold equipment needed for ranching. There were various chutes and passageways for the farm animals that the clinic looked after.<br />
<br />
I quietly went in through the main door and found a fairly common looking waiting room with a few people waiting with pets in their cages and carrying cases. A receptionist was going through some paperwork at the moment and wasn't looking my way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, I'm George Wayne, I have an appoint with a &quot;Doc Stimson&quot;,&quot; I said to the receptionist.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who is the appointment for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... myself, actually,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
She looked up and then jumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! I'm sorry,&quot; the receptionist spoke, &quot;Officer Howard made the call, we thought you were a new canine officer and that he didn't give the dog's name... it's...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; I told her, &quot;to be honest, I hadn't thought I would be having to see a vet for my medical needs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; the receptionist chuckled, &quot;Doc Stimson charges a lot less for pets and livestock then most doctors do for human patients. Though, you'll be his first exotic animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;The doctor will let you know when he his ready to see you,&quot; the receptionist answered.<br />
<br />
I nodded and moved to stand away from where I would be in the way and to avoid antagonizing the few dogs that in the waiting room. Not that I feared them, quite the opposite. Their barking from their containers was an agitating thing to me. But I restrained myself.<br />
<br />
After a few moments a middle aged man wearing glasses came out from a hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Wayne, come this way,&quot; the man spoke, &quot;I'm Alex Stimson, though most people call me Doc Stimson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I spoke, &quot;I am here for my shots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doc Stimson nodded, &quot;I'd like to do some basic measurements on you as well. Just so you can put your stats on straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have to get down on the ground so you can take my height,&quot; I said, &quot;as I'm presently hunched over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we'll have to take you to the cattle scales as you're likely too heavy for the scales for dogs and cats,&quot; Doc Stimson chuckled.<br />
<br />
I continued to follow him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must say I was surprised to have Officer Howard make the appointment, but I can understand your nervousness on such issues,&quot; Doc Stimson continued, &quot;if someone had simply told me about some scientific formula that can transform a human into an animal, I would have never believed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
Doc Stimson nodded, and motioned to a room, &quot;we can do the vaccinations there.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then pressed an intercom type button and led me in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I must tell you that I'm not versed on diseases of any of the tiger subspecies... or any exotic animal really,&quot; Doc Stimson admitted, &quot;I had to go online to get what diseases tigers encounter in the wild. The only one that I was familiar with was Rabies, though that virus isn't commonly found in felines... it's quite possible they're smart enough to avoid rabid animals...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd still prefer to be vaccinated against it,&quot; I told him, &quot;just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Doc Stimson nodded, &quot;anyway, what I've researched has indicated that none of the contaminants that the tiger encounters in Asia are here, so we should be good in that regard. However, as a large cat, I am fairly certain that you are also vulnerable to the same diseases domestic felines are vulnerable to. So today we will be giving you the first in the series of shots to vaccinate you against these diseases... or at least the ones we can vaccinate. Has there been a history of diabetes in your family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'll be a plus, although I'd probably still be careful,&quot; Doc Stimson nodded.<br />
<br />
A few moments later a nurse came in with a rolling table. On a platter on the table were several syringes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to make a few calls to make sure I got the right dosage,&quot; Doc Stimson spoke, and picked up one syringe, &quot;the first will be the first dosage of the Rabies vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
I cringed but managed to keep from twitching as he injected the needle into my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a very good patient, Mr. Wayne,&quot; Doc Stimson commented as he did the injection, &quot;if only mundane pets behaved as good as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's the difference between a mundane animal and an evolved animal,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite right,&quot; Doc Stimson nodded and reached for the next syringe, &quot;Here we go.&quot;</p>
