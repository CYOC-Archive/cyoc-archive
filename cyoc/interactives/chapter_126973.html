<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty leaned back against the tree, thinking. The scope of the options presented to him was daunting. Did he just wish for a packed suitcase and a plane ticket to Hawaii? Did he wish for a mansion full of maids ready to... He&#39;d save that thought for later. <br />
<br />
But the more he thought, the more his ideas spun around in his head, the more they kept coming back to the one gaping hole in his life. His home life. As tempting as the infinite treasure trove his powers offered were, all he really wanted out of life right now was a family that actually treated him like part of it, not some house servant they probably just adopted for the governmental subsidy. <br />
<br />
Kaylee noticed the sullen expression Ty&#39;s face had taken, and nudged up closer to him. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed deeply and explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. The family you told me about.&quot; She said, flatly. &quot;I do not think I like them. You&#39;re a very good person Ty, any family should be happy to have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nudged her shoulder. &quot;C&#39;mon I&#39;m not perfect. But... God, its complicated. I don&#39;t think I hate them. I don&#39;t WANT to hate them. All I want is a family that... well. Loves me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee gave him a long hard look. &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you just get that then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylee booped him on the forehead. &quot;You know what I mean silly! Just wish them into a family you&#39;d be happy with! One that appreciates you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty recalled the inadvertant wish he had made causing his brother to de-age, and the sick guilt he had felt over it. <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do that Kaylee! I... I can&#39;t just force people to change, to rewrite them like that! I mean, with you, I gave you awareness, and then I gave you the chance to consent to being changed. I wasn&#39;t taking your free will away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee huffed. &quot;Which I&#39;m greatly appreciative of it. But what you gave me is just my point! Before you changed me, I have no CONCEPT of how wonderful your change to me would be! If you had asked the animal I had been, it probably would never have asked to be changed, but now I&#39;m like this and I&#39;d never want to go back!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee stood up, proud and tall, having the inadvertant effect of shadowing Ty under her sizable bust. &quot;If you weren&#39;t supposed to change people, why were you given the power to? You made my existence into something wonderful! Who&#39;s to say changing them is what they need? They sound like some really miserable people to be so mean to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty tried to argue, but any defense he had felt weak compared to Kaylee&#39;s sudden iron-clad will. &quot;It still doesnt feel right.&quot; <br />
<br />
Katie crossed her arms and pouted. &quot;It also doesn&#39;t feel right that this bunch of mean humans has made my boyfriend so hurt. You deserve a family that appreciates you as much as I do! In fact, you should change them like you changed me, make them fun and sexy  animal people! Or something else!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s face twisted into a puzzled expression. &quot;What? Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One, as punishment, and two, they&#39;d become as happy as I am! It wouldn&#39;t be wrong to transform them if it feels as good as it did for me right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;T-they&#39;re my -family- Kaylee! That&#39;s just...&quot; He remembered his idle fantasies about his family transforming, and quickly buried them down. &quot;Wrong for several reasons!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;According to my understanding of human society that&#39;s in my head, so is having sex with animals.&quot; Retorted Kaylee. &quot;Besides, they&#39;re not genetically related to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s ALL the reason why you want me to turn my family into furries like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee blushed a little. &quot;Well...&quot; She twiddled her thumbs nervously. &quot;I&#39;d also...&quot; She tooka  deep breath. &quot;IreallywannaseemorepeopletransformbecauseIthinkitisverysexyandfun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, are you just trying to convince me to fulfill your TF Kink?&quot; Ty said, grinning know that he was catching on to Kaylee&#39;s game.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I think it would be best for you too! And! Well! You also like transforming things I bet! I saw how excited you were to change me! I bet you want to see what your powers could do to them as much as I do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler clammed up, the sweat beading on hsi brow all the evidence Kaylee needed. &quot;Aha!&quot; She cried. &quot;I knew it. Ty, just admit that this is a good idea. You get a family that loves you, they get to feel the wonderful change, and I get to see it! Everyone wins!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty got up, looking unsure. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s still weird.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled. &quot;Weird is great! And, consider it in this way Ty. If you change your family, and still feel bad about it after you&#39;ve seen them, you can just turn them back. No consequences!&quot; She punctuated her offer by giving Ty a suggestive wink, which made his heart skip a beat. Damnit, she really had him body and soul. And her arguments were really starting to convince him. <br />
<br />
What if he really could have the family of his dreams? Not just one that loved him, but one that fulfilled his more wild fantasies? He pictured the possibilities, and a shameful thrill passed through him. He COULD turn them back when he was done. He could, theoretically, celebrate his birthday with the family forged from his deepest desires, and then turn them back, move out, and live a life with his beautiful girlfriend somewhere tropical. <br />
<br />
And he had to admit. He WAS just as curious just how much he could do with his powers, just like Kaylee was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Okay.&quot; Ty relented. &quot;But. Shit. What do I do? I mean, what animals? Do I change their genders? Do I make them aware of the change or not?&quot; Now that he was indulging the idea, his mind was going into overtime considering the full range of factors, trying to pick and choose what elements from his various TF sexual fantasies he wanted to realize. <br />
<br />
Kaylee grinned, happy her dearest (Hm. Puns.) was ready to indulge along with her. This deer had turned out to be quite the kinkster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have a suggestion. Why not make it a surprise? Try this...&quot; She walked up closer and placed her hands on either side of Ty&#39;s face. &quot;I wish that my foster family would transform into new forms, and become the family I have aways wanted them to be, while also changing to fulfill my sexual fantasies each change being unique according to the family member. Neither they nor anyone else will have no knowledge of their previous selves and treat their situation as normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. That&#39;s a mouthful.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee stuck her tongue out. &quot;But is it to your satisfaction darling?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty thought for a second and nodded, repeating his wish. <br />
<br />
For a second, he felt a -pulse- emanate from his body, and vice-like pressure around his head. Kaylee panicked seeing him clench in discomfort, before the wave passed and Ty felt oddly fine, as though the discomfort had never happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Asked Kaylee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Yeah. That was weird... I guess that was a really strong one.&quot; &quot;Remarked Ty, rubbing his forehead. &quot;I guess it worked though, since my head didn&#39;t explode.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we will have to go and see for ourselves!&quot; Said Kaylee, excited. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I live out this way.&quot; Said Ty, starting to walk back the way he came into the forest, before Kaylee cleared her through. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Asked Ty. &quot;Oh. Duh. I wish me and Kaylee were standing in front of my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with another quivering sensation, Ty&#39;s vision of the world turned blurry. When it came back to focus, he and Kaylee were just where he wished to be.<br />
<br />
What struck his attention first was how... nicer the house looked. Literally. The welcome mat was replaced by a big, new one, with WELCOME!!!! emblazoned in golden happy letters. The lawn was now perfectly maintained, with flowering bushes perfectly trimmed, and particularly jolly looking gnomes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well. That&#39;s a good sign.&quot; Said Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Asked Kaylee, who was mostly enamored with her first sight of an actual human dwelling. <br />
<br />
&quot;It means in THIS family, someone other than me does all the yard work.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee giggled at that. &quot;I must admit, this grass does look especially green and inviting.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hungry for a snack Kaylee?&quot; Joked Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later. I want to see your family now!&quot; She said excitedly. <br />
<br />
Ty nodded, taking a deep breath, and checking the door. It was unlocked, thankfully, he knew they kept a spare key outside, but it would probably have been put in a new location now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Ty asked while walking in. Again, the house was the same... but nicer. He was about to walk over to an end-table he knew had some family photos on it, to see if he could get a view of the whole family, before a voice calling out from the kitchen jolted him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, sweety? Is that you?&quot; The voice was almost unrecognizable, just for how soft and sweet the tone was. But after a second of thought, Ty recognized it as his foster mother&#39;s voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just where have you been young man?&quot; Said the voice sternly. Ty was worried for a second, before it continued. &quot;You&#39;ve been missing out on your own birthday you silly billy! Now come here and let me get a look at you, don&#39;t want you looking scruffy on your special day!&quot; <br />
<br />
It was simply bizarre. It was a complete 180 from what he knew June was like. And he hadn&#39;t even seen what she had turned into yet. He steeled himself, and walked into the kitchen, and was still unprepared for the sight before him.</p>
