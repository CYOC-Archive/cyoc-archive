<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Haw! There was no way Nate was selling Owen out in the middle of his script. He still had months to go before he could change himself back to normal…! Even if this TransDem rep could change him back physically, he still had a contract with Paper Corp. Nate needed Owen to change him back, get him out of this donkey reality, and restore… oh man, the list was starting to get really long. His human form, his intelligence, his job… and he had a nicer apartment than this, right?<br />
<br />
The TransDem rep was still waiting for an answer. Nate held up the watch on his arm, &quot;The friendly box said it was the Chronivac 5 Pro.&quot; He gave her a goofy bucktooth grin. &quot;Anything else Ms. Smith?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, &quot;I think that will be all.&quot; She started to close his door, &quot;Donkey, really?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Haw!” Nate just gave her a content bray. She finally closed the door.<br />
<br />
What was <i>that</i> all about? He walked back inside of his apartment. After a few moments had passed, he tapped the front of his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You owe me one,&quot; He brayed.<br />
<br />
The watch just sat there inert.<br />
<br />
Nate sighed. That weird interaction with the TransDem woman had used up most of his prep time this morning. He had just enough time to brush his big teeth and catch his bus. Hopefully he could take a shower at the office before his shift.<br />
<br />
He spit his toothpaste into his sink and felt a small buzz on his wrist. Nate glanced at the watch, smiling at the message on his screen.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Added: Donkey Hooves.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Nate looked down. While he had been brushing his teeth, his feet had completely shifted into two massive black pieces of uh, whatever hooves were made of. He clopped one experimentally on the floor. The echoing clop felt pleasant to his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Owen.&quot; He beamed.<br />
<br />
Before heading back to the office, Nate quickly locked up and slid his key back underneath his door mat. The bus ride into work was thankfully uneventful. Well, uneventful other than everyone trying to steal a peek at the guy who had been desperate enough to sign up for a donkey job. At least this time Nate had managed to find a few spare coins scattered around his house for the bus fare. <br />
<br />
Nate was sure Owen would want to speak up at some point about what had happened back at his apartment, but he stayed quiet as usual. Towards the end of his ride however, he got a small buzz on his wrist.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Reality Altered: Donkeys live in corporate dormitories.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Haw! Nate didn&#39;t like the sound of that! He snuck back down to the basement floor, and found things a bit more expansive then he remembered before. Dozens of donkeys were clopping around at this point in various states of morning preparedness.<br />
<br />
Nate glanced around the bustle of activity. Right now he needed to get a fresh jumpsuit and find number Five... He understood why their ear tags were color coordinated now. It was really hard to spot anyone in this crowd of nearly-identical donkey men.<br />
<br />
Nate found a “B” locker and started to unzip his jumpsuit. He heard something crinkle in his pocket. Shoot! The note with his name on it! He had completely forgotten to put it somewhere safe last night. Thankfully lockers were pretty safe. There was a little shelf on top with a few stray knick knacks. Nate reached into the far back and tucked his note into the corner. It should be safe there until he got back to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just where the hell were you last night!?&quot; Nate knew the stern voice of a human anywhere.<br />
<br />
He spun around, watching Five trail after a very grumpy looking Mr. Smith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw... I went home?&quot; Nate blinked. &quot;To my apartment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Smith rubbed his head, &quot;One Seventeen, this is your home now. We&#39;re in the process of terminating your apartment&#39;s contract.&quot; The human turned to Five, &quot;How did he sneak out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Five looked sheepish, &quot;He must have wandered off when I was showering sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate felt genuinely bad for getting Five in trouble. &quot;Hee haw, sorry sir, I&#39;m new at all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
“We’re just lucky you had the wherewithal to actually come back this morning.&quot; He rubbed his head one last time, &quot;Don&#39;t go wandering off again.&quot; He poked Nate in the chest. Haw, he didn&#39;t like being yelled at.<br />
<br />
The man turned to Five, &quot;Make sure he gets all the proper corporate trainings today, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw! Yessir!&quot; Five stood up as straight as his paunch would allow.<br />
<br />
The human wandered off to go check on something else. Five gave Nate a bit of a conspiratorial grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw, don&#39;t do that again One Seventeen.&quot; He chuckled, &quot;But... how was it? I can&#39;t remember the last time I left the office.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate gulped, &quot;Fine? I uh- I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d be giving up my apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five looked a little surprised when Nate responded to him with a casual string of brays. He dropped his own English immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got pretty nice dorms here.&quot; Five brayed. His supervisor was starting to fish around in his pocket for something.<br />
<br />
Corporate donkey dorms… Was this Owen teasing him, or was he just trying to keep Nate away from the TransDem woman?<br />
<br />
Finally Five pulled out a small prepackaged snack bar, &quot;Here, you missed breakfast, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked it over curiously. It appeared to be a granola bar, but it was a brand he didn’t recognize. It was an oat bar apparently, and had a large cartoon donkey on the wrapper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nate quickly unwrapped the bar. &quot;I didn&#39;t actually get a chance to shower or change yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s alright, it’s probably best if you don&#39;t.&quot; Five rubbed the back of his head, &quot;We need to get you trained. Come on.”<br />
<br />
Nate followed after Five. He nibbled on the breakfast bar as he clopped, and ho-ly donk! Oats were amazing! Nate was expecting Five to lead him to some sort of classroom setting or corporate seminar. Instead, Five took him back to the break room couch from yesterday. His supervisor donkey picked up the VR headset he had seen Forty-Something use earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;The company has a lot of rules they like us to follow. We used to have to watch all these boring trainings on the laptops, but they got us these cool headset things a few years ago.&quot; He handed it over to Nate, &quot;Just watch this for a few hours. You should be done by lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw? Oh, uh- Okay.&quot; Nate looked the headset over. That sounded... really boring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, we have to watch at least one of these videos a week, but new guys have to get caught up.&quot; He chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll find something fun to assign you to the in the afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Nate smiled, pulling the headset over his face gently. It wobbled a bit, almost like- Oh wow. It was meant for someone who had a muzzle in the middle of their face. He was able to get it to sit right after tightening down the straps a bit more. As his world became covered in darkness, a video started to play.<br />
<br />
The corporate training was a weird twist on the boring compliance modules that Nate had to do as a human. They all had a strange barnyard motif that he supposed would be easier for his simple donkey mind to understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations on choosing to become a Paper Corp Donkey!&quot; The announcer spoke in English, but they had a friendly enough tone to it.<br />
<br />
Nate hadn&#39;t actually gotten a chance to play with one of these headsets yet. Everywhere he looked he could see rolling green hills of tasty looking grass. Off in the distance there was a bright red barn with a fresh trough of water that made Nate a little thirsty. The device had speakers mounted right by the base of his ears, so no matter where he looked he got the messages the company wanted to.<br />
<br />
Honestly, he could have assumed most of this stuff on his own. It was very important for him to <i>obey</i> his superiors. He had to <i>serve</i> humans. Duh. He had signed up to become a lowly donkey, of course he was going to <i>obey</i> Mr. Smith. He was working here, naturally he&#39;d do a good job and <i>serve</i> while on the clock.<br />
<br />
Nate let his mind wander as the headset told him about the basic duties of a corporate donkey. It had dawned on him that he really was working just for room and board now. The atmosphere in the locker room this morning almost felt like summer camp. Everyone had been scurrying around getting showered and grabbing breakfast before getting ready to <i>serve</i>.<br />
<br />
The headset kept addressing him as One Seventeen. It seemed to have eye tracking built in. Somehow it knew when he wasn&#39;t paying enough attention to the course material at hand. One Seventeen was such a long number. How did you get a nice short one like Five? It didn&#39;t matter. He was going to <i>obey</i> any time someone called him One Seventeen. It was just a mouthful.<br />
<br />
A few minutes after he started his training, One Seventeen could feel hands over his body. He hadn&#39;t realized how relaxingly limp he had gone just now. He didn&#39;t raise a finger to stop the mystery hands from slowly peeling off the headset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw, ready for lunch One Seventeen?&quot; Five brayed with a smile.<br />
<br />
Nate sat up, &quot;Haw? I just started.&quot; He brayed back.<br />
<br />
Five shook his head, &quot;It just feels like that. You&#39;ve been going for a little over four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw, really?&quot; Nate was still moving slowly. His body felt comfortably numb. As the feeling came back though, he realized he was a little clammy. Haw, wait, he was sweaty all over.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen sat up a bit faster. He felt his jumpsuit brush up against his manhood and- Hee haw! He was rock hard! The inside of his jumpsuit felt wet, and Nate could see a significant damp spot through the material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh haw.&quot; Nate stared down at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that you wouldn&#39;t need to change first.&quot; Five laughed softly, &quot;They make the trainings feel nice. I think they want us to look forward to them. Go shower, I&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t miss lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate stood up, &quot;Yessir!&quot; He immediately started clopping towards the showers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey One Seventeen, put your jumpsuit in the laundry first.&quot; Five pointed to an industrial sized hamper at the end of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Nate began to undress. He was still a little shy changing in front of Five, but he had just told him what to do. So he did it.<br />
<br />
As Nate peeled his jumpsuit off, he realized he was still incredibly hard. His boner hadn’t gone down at all since he came out of VR…! His cock just bobbed in the air as he tossed his jumpsuit into the hamper.<br />
<br />
“I’ll uh- Be right back!” Nate covered his crotch, quickly rushing off towards the showers.<br />
<br />
Whoever built this place didn’t do it privacy in mind. Nate had to walk out into the main hallway to get to the showers. Well &quot;clop&quot; into the hallway. He was still getting used to the fact that he was standing on hooves. His boner bobbed in the air the whole way there. <br />
<br />
His efforts to hide his nudity seemed to be attracting almost as much attention as his naked half-human figure was on its own. Nate tried to remind himself that his peers didn&#39;t have any modesty. He slowly lowered his hands and did his best to just adopt that mindset. By the time he got to the showers, no one was batting an eye at him.<br />
<br />
The warm water felt nice after a day and a half of not showering. One Seventeen couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the communal shower’s mother of all shampoo dispensers. He was scrubbing the top of his mane when he noticed there was a notification showing on his watch.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Mental Adjustment: Corporate Brainwashing (Basic).&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Haw...? Was Owen making a joke? That- Those were just corporate training videos! Nate felt fine. He was having a hard time scrubbing the back of his mane, but his head was fine.<br />
<br />
“Haw, need some help there?” Nate heard a friendly bray.<br />
<br />
He turned around, discovering one of the tall donkeys had entered the shower. His head was almost up to the shower head itself.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, that’s be great!” Nate nodded.<br />
<br />
“Alright, hold still newbie.” The donkey rubbed a bit of shampoo onto his hands.<br />
<br />
The showers were too steamy to get a good read on the donkey’s number tag. Mhmm, it felt nice having him work the shampoo into Nate’s back though.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. I- Hawwww…” Nate’s mouth dropped open as the donkey rubbed a nice spot on his back.<br />
<br />
“Haw? I’m getting my turn too.” They donkey teased, “Can you do my back?”<br />
<br />
Nate’s ears perked, “Right! Sure!” He wagged gently.<br />
<br />
Nate got some shampoo on his hands and started to scrub the donkey’s back. He had fur <i>everywhere…!</i> No wonder these donkeys were in the habit of helping each other out.<br />
<br />
“So… how far are you into your two years?” Nate asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Haw? What are you talking about?” The donkey had his eyes closed, and mostly just seemed to be enjoying the back rub.<br />
<br />
“Your contract?” Nate reminded him.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” He laughed, “Newbie, I’m on my third contract.”<br />
<br />
“Third?” Nate stared, watching the donkey rinse off.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” he smiled, “After my first two years, I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. I sign up for five year contracts now.”<br />
<br />
Nate’s cock bobbed in the air.<br />
<br />
“…really?” Nate stammered.<br />
<br />
“You need some help with that?” He chuckled, pointing down between Nate’s legs. “Corporate trainings?”<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, “Haw, yeah, how’s you know?”<br />
<br />
“Mine always has a hard time going down afterwards too.” The donkey grinned, gathering up some suds on his hoof hand, “Here.”<br />
<br />
The donkey casually spun Nate around. He rested his head on Nate’s shoulder and then reached around to his front side. His clumsy fingers didn’t need much dexterity to wrap around Nate’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw!” Nate brayed excitedly.<br />
<br />
The donkey over his shoulder laughed softly, “This is kinda fun. Everyone here already knows everyone else’s sweet spot.” His hand shifted, sliding a bit faster, “Let’s see if you like this…!”<br />
<br />
“Haw!” Nate felt his legs buckle. He wanted to say something more intelligent than that to the donkey, but words just… weren’t working right now.<br />
<br />
Nate got a buzz on his wrist. The hair around his crotch started to thicken, shifting into scruffy donkey fur. It started to creep up over his balls as they swelled in size.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw! Hee haw!” Nate moaned. He was so close…!<br />
<br />
“That’s it…” The tall donkey whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Finally Nate couldn’t take anymore. His cock let loose a torrent of sticky seed. It splatted on the shower wall and slid down to the large industrial drains.<br />
<br />
“There we go.” The donkey patted him on the head with a clean hand, “Feeling better now?”<br />
<br />
Nate panted softly, “Yeah, I… Thank you.” He smiled shyly.<br />
<br />
“Don’t mention it,” the donkey uncoupled from Nate. Nate couldn’t help but notice the beast man’s cock was showing. Oh man, it as huge…! His shaft was a glistening black, with an exotic flat shape that Nate could my help but want to get to know a bit more closely.<br />
<br />
“You want me to return the favor?” Nate gave a sheepish grin.”<br />
<br />
The donkey laughed, shutting off his water, “Nah, I’ve got another shift. My tip will go down on its own.” He chuckled.<br />
<br />
Wait, that was just the tip!?<br />
<br />
“Maybe tonight after work,” the donkey teased. He patted Nate on the back, “Don’t you have your own shift to get back to?”<br />
<br />
Haw! He was right! Nate tried to rinse himself off as he watched the donkey go. He never did catch his number…! How many green tagged tall donkeys could there be?<br />
<br />
He tried to push the concern to the back of his mind. He needed to get ready to <i>serve</i> again.</p>
