<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just a few minutes prior, Jesse had been the most normal thing in an otherwise unconventional and strange world. This changed around 4:30 when Nick’s changes for him triggered. <br />
<br />
It started in his feet. Jesse’s feet grew exponentially large, now about 2 feet in length alone. His shoes, now obliterated, fell to the ground and disappeared. Next his legs exploded with muscle, thicker and more dense then a neutron star. His shorts he had just a moment prior been sporting met the same fate as his shoes. His boxers underneath became stretched and were soon destroyed and a snapping of elastic. Next, Jesse’s entire body split down the center, temporarily forming an odd half and half of his former self. They then reformed identically atop the mighty legs that had grown beneath them. Almost like a balloon, both bodies inflated with muscle in the chest, the pecs, and the arms. A startling 12 pack lay below enourmous pecs. Suddenly, two extra arms on each body sprouted out as well as an extra two heads. Any imperfections disappeared from Jesse’s face and body. His hair swirled around similarly to Nick’s and his faces melded to match his friend’s as well. <br />
<br />
Now sleeping awkwardly in the tree (if you could even still call it one) was a man, at least 10 feet tall with two separate torsos attached to his lower half. Each body had four arms and two heads. No clothes remained and the creation was even more attractive than any of the other Nick’s around. <br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, all of the Nicks in the park began to notice him and walked almost hypnotically forward to stare at him. And there they stood when the original Nick almost ran into the tree. Nick was astounded by it. It was greater than anything he had ever imagined. He looked around and noticed the lust of all the Nicks. However, like a ripple effect, more and more Nicks showed up. As some left to see the commotion, they attracted more and more Nicks. Soon there was a large crowd staring at the tree. <br />
<br />
The left Jesse shifted position trying to become more comfortable in his sleep. This caused an uproar as people piled on top of each other to get closer and see the man. This loudness woke up both Jesses who looked around to see adoring Nicks craving his attention. This was usual, everyone loved Jesse. <br />
<br />
In perfect unison, the Jesse stood up in the tree and with all for heads shouted, “Who will I choose today?”<br />
<br />
The Nicks scrambled about trying to get into view of at least one of the heads so as to be chosen. The original Nick forced himself through the crowd and with startling athleticism climbed the tree to reach Jesse. <br />
<br />
“I’ve seen what your changes were,” Nick explained happily. “And so I’ve changed something of you too-”<br />
<br />
While the right half of Jesse continued to look out into the crowd, the left half turned around with impossible contortionism and looked over Nick. <br />
<br />
“Have I chosen you before?” the right head of the right side asked. He looked at Nick as if puzzled, unrecognizing. <br />
<br />
“No?” Nick said. “You’re just my roommate. The Chronivac? Do you remember?” <br />
<br />
“What an astonishing name!” the left head shouted. “I’ve never heard anyone name their dorm something, definitely not something like that.”<br />
<br />
And with that the right Jesse pushed Nick out of he tree and turned back around towards the booming crowd. Nick was forced backwards against the surging groups of other Nick, and disheartenly walked away. <br />
<br />
Something must have gone wrong with the transformation. Nick realized that he had made the judgement as a Nick in a Nick world. That monstrosity out there was not Jesse, it was someone else. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Nick was tripped and fell to the ground faceplanting into a set of abs. He turned around to see the sidewalk (or more appropriately the Nick Sidewalk) had moved. One of its members had moved there arm in the direction of the crowd. Slowly, it freaked out of the ground and slowly at first, began to run at full speed toward Jesse. Nick felt the ground give way as the Nick he had landed on stood up violently and lustfully looked toward Jesse before starting off himself. <br />
<br />
All around Nick, Nicks who had been inanimate taking places of sidewalks and building and ground started to come alive and attempt to get their hand at Jesse. <br />
<br />
Nick realized that he had in fact set it so that all Nicks except himself were attracted to Jesse, and that truly had come to fruition. <br />
<br />
As the rate increased, Nate sprinted towards his dorm to try and find a solution with the Chronivac. As he approached it, his door ran off and part of his wall as well. The chronivac sat on the floor where Jesse’s bed had been, but there must’ve been no need for it in this reality. <br />
<br />
All around Nick, Nicks began to recede and run in the direction of Jesse, which forced Nick to walk upstream against a wall of super massive super strong men. By the time he reached the Chronivac, a hole lay in he center of his room. The hole moved around swaying as buff man after buff man rushed outwards. Nick opened the Chronivac and accessed the changes. Men kept bumping into him, feet and hands typing accidental key strokes as Nick typed away trying to undo his mistake. <br />
<br />
A toe accidentally hit the enter button, followed by another Nick face planting into the computer confirming to Nick’s horror his unfinished work of undoing this crisis.</p>
