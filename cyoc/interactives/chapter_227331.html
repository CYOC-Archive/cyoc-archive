<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking from a dreamless sleep, Dawn’s vision felt blurry as the skylight above her shone light from the clear morning sky above. She was not used to waking up in a brightly lit room; as this was her aunt and uncle’s house, Dawn had no way to cover the window above her. Struggling to extricate herself from a pile of fury bodies; Dawn was surprised she managed to get any sleep at all. While her twin brother Dusk wasn’t a problem; it was her grandparent’s twin cubs Oliver and Paul, her toddler aged uncles. The twin white furred wolf cubs were bounding with energy when they all went to bed. The two excited from the fireworks, they started trying to reenact their favorite fireworks explosion. Her brother wasn’t being any help as he opted to lay down on the floor with a pillow. Strangely, Oliver and Paul took the hint and used him as their pillow as they decided they were now sleepy.<br />
<br />
The anthro doe-deer fury stretches as her small nub of a tail; a tail of white fur twitches. Her tawny brown fur still displaying the white spots of a new born fawn, where not covered over with pink. Half of Dawn’s fur was magically dyed pink as a punishment for a prank she tried to commit at school. Along with her twin brother; a charcoal gray furred wolf fury, also sported a magical pink dye job. Although his is not as pronounced as he decided to listen to their father and stop sulking. Heading to the door and opening it, she looks to see if anyone is up before dashing to the washroom across the hall.<br />
<br />
After a few minute spent sitting on the toilet and relieving herself, Dawn exits the washroom; she was unsure what the device next to the toilet was as there was no toilet paper, she never bothered to wipe before flushing. Walking on the carpet and heading downstairs, Dawn’s hooves hitting the hardwood; she couldn’t remain silent as her steps made a distinctive clicking sound. Checking the living room and then the kitchen, she makes her way to the basement to see no one there as well.<br />
“Is no one up yet,” Dawn seeing how bright the house has become thanks to the skylights; heading back to the living room and noticing the t.v, Dawn looks for the remote to watch cartoons.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
In the master bedroom, where four adult furies slumbered fitfully in each other’s embrace; Brittany began to stir from her slumber. A pleasant feeling enveloped her as she slowly woke up; Feeling the arms of her mate wrapped around her as he slept next to her, while Alison’s muzzle was inches from her. The cougar fury was also being embraced by her mate the same way she was; Smiling, Brittany slowly get ups and yawns as she heads for the master bath. Entering and making a beeline to the toilet, Brittany perks up when she notices the bidet next to the toilet she quickly sat on. The familiar hiss of urine exiting her vulva as she voided her bladder gave the wolf fury a contented sigh. Smiling as she gets up and watches as a jet of water shoots up from the adjoining porcelain plumbing item. Brittany giggles as she tightens up the dial and squats as a cold blast of water splashes on her entrance.<br />
“Hell of a remodel,” Brittany chuckling as her runes glow and the fur around her sex dries; “hell of a remodel.”<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom and then bedroom, Brittany soon makes her way down the hall; stopping to check on her cubs, she opens the door to find Dusk along with Oliver and Paul still sleeping but her daughter Dawn is not present. Not worried but slightly concerned, the anthro wolf fury walks towards the next room and opens to door. Seeing her nephew Jimmy J.R sleeping on his bed; Brittany chuckled as both Roxy and Sora somehow managed to find room on the small bed and were snuggled next to him. She couldn’t help but burst out in laughter as Jimmy J.R’s cat Dickens somehow managed to find a spot between the bodies to nest in. His blue eyes wide open as he makes a scramble to get up and out; Brittany giggles as the tiny critter snakes around her fury legs, purring loudly before dashing to the stairs. She watches as the cat turns around and makes cry, waiting for her to move.<br />
“You want me to feed you,” Brittany cluing into the cat’s simples cries in return; “you might have to wait until others wake up. Unless,” Brittany getting a clever idea; Getting close to pick the feline up, she cradles him with care as she walks to the master bedroom and places him in the room.<br />
“Now be a relentless imp and wake the rest up,” Brittany chuckling as she closes the door before heading downstairs.<br />
<br />
Noticing Dawn sitting on the living room sofa, Brittany sighs as she approaches to see her daughter watching an old black and white sitcom from a now defunct production company.<br />
“It was all I could find,” Dawn seeing her mother watching her and then looking at the television; “Aunt Alison has half of the channels locked out.”<br />
“She has her reasons,” Brittany answering as she sits down next to her daughter; summoning her phone and absently tapping on it as it appears  in the grip of her hand paw. “From the looks of things,” Brittany taking the remote and giving a quick scan of the channels; “most of them have content not age appropriate for you or your nephew.”<br />
“Is this what furies use to look like,” Dawn watching the program that her mother put back after exiting the menu; the show showed a middle aged woman crying after not getting her way, while her what Dawn assumed was her mate walked away.<br />
“Your father and I were human once,” Brittany watching the show; familiar with the premise and that the actors were a real life couple at the time this particular episode was filmed. “But then we received this gift that made us the furies we are today,” Brittany making her phone vanish; “same as your Aunt, Uncle and grandparents. Why do you ask?”<br />
“What is that on them,” Dawn ignoring her mother’s question.<br />
<br />
“Clothes,” Brittany responding; “humans wore them for warmth and as well as to hide their shame. They don’t have fur,” Brittany looking at her daughter; “and have an aversion to being nude in public. You’ll learn more when summer break is over,” Brittany looking up and smiling; Walking down the stairs was Alison with an excited looking cat bounding to the kitchen. Following the two were Jimmy and Jake Proudhoof; twin brothers when they were human, now twin anthro stag-deers, both yawning in unison as they stared at both Brittany and Dawn.<br />
“What are you watching,” Jake slowly approaching his mate and daughter; his brother walking to the kitchen to try and scare up some coffee while a certain cat gets fed.<br />
“An old black and white sitcom,” Brittany getting up; “pioneering in its day, but rather tame by today’s standards.”<br />
“And who let the cat into the room,” Jake looking at his daughter accusingly; making her feel uncomfortable as if she got caught doing something she wasn’t supposed to do.<br />
“That would be me,” Brittany getting up; “had to find a way to keep that imp from tormenting me. The fact that he woke you all up was a happy bonus.”<br />
“And to think,” Jake shaking his head as Dawn breathes a sigh of relief; “I wondered where our daughter got her impulses for pranks. And now I know,” Jake chortling as he heads to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Brittany was the one who let loose Dickens on us,” Jake entering the kitchen to see the cat eating his breakfast. “Her plan to get us all up and to not feed the monster,” Jake’s eyes turning to the coffee machine as it started to drip hot brown ambrosia.<br />
“Relatively harmless,” Jimmy yawning as he grabs a few mugs from the cupboard; “anyone need cream or sugar? Or just take it straight black?”<br />
“Juice for me love,” Alison watching her mate head to fridge. “I can’t have caffeine or liquor until this bun is done growing,” Alison rubbing her stomach as the pregnancy test she took yesterday prior to their private rut session turned positive.<br />
“I can’t believe I boinked my brother’s pregnant mate,” Jake shaking his head before looking at Alison and giving off a wicked grin; “and I hope you are carrying twins.”<br />
<br />
“Coffee is done,” Jimmy shaking head as he sighs; knowing that Alison could be pregnant by the time of last night’s party didn’t dissuade him from the evening’s romp; it just made him silently thankful that Alison’s heat came on her shortly after not taking her suppression meds while their son was away for a month long camping trip. “Help me with the breakfast, Jake,” Jimmy getting out the pancake mix and other ingredients; “we got cubs who will be waking up shortly and all are going to be hungry.”</p>
