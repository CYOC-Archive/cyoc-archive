<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door to the heroes&#39; chambers in the inn swung shut.<br />
<br />
But alas, today, the walls of this grand inn were thinner than they would seem.<br />
<br />
Bryndon trusted himself and Lissa to enjoy their alone time, away from the others, knowing he could at least deal with that and not be tempted by their licentious ways. He valued them as teammates and friends, but their...ways...reminded him too much of his struggles with the flesh. Little did Bryndon know that it was not only his teammates he would need to watch out for as the curse started to settle first into his own well muscled form.<br />
<br />
Which, even covered with scars as it was, retained the pleasant capacity for sensitivity. Bryndon knew well enough by the interactions had on the road that he was regarded as a well muscled, handsome man - and a hero, at that. Lending a dynamic sort of appeal which made some people desire to get to know him better.<br />
<br />
In ways Bryndon wished they would cease trying. The only time when a Paladin was approved to engage in such trysts was within the confines of marriage, and Bryndon intended to live up to that----<br />
<br />
Even as the door opened next door, and his heart sank as he started to hear something. Heart sank and cock lurched. He heard it and saw Lissa gasp and cover her mouth, trying to hide the fact she bit her lip. The couple next door giggling and the soft sound of a cloth tunic landing on the floor, followed by a set of slacks. Lissa looked at Bryndon imploringly, and he didn&#39;t even have the time to think of what she was imploring.<br />
<br />
Bryndon clenched his fist in front of his chest, and announced, &quot;I will go and take a bath, to calm my errant nerves. Please be calm, Lady Lissa.&quot; He said it in as calm a way as possible, to make it less obvious that he experienced roiling, continuous strife within. His chest pounded and he could feel his nipples pressing against his shirt and even his armor beyond that. The sound of the woman starting to moan set to work a need in Bryndon.<br />
<br />
His hand wavered. He clenched it tighter, thankful for his armor. Otherwise, he&#39;d have drawn blood by now.<br />
<br />
Bryndon gulped as he felt his muscled ass clench tight, never familiar with that end of his anatomy. He managed to head off toward the bathing chambers in the inn room. His face was alight with a blush bright red, even as he separated himself into the bathing chamber. The door shut behind him, he made sure to lock it. He trusted Lissa, but he didn&#39;t trust HIMSELF.<br />
<br />
Piece by piece his armor came free, and showed the well muscled, scarred man under it. Weathered skin from his campaign freed from the armor after such a long day. He wore only a sleeveless tunic, a chainmail shirt and slacks underneath, as well as a set of undergarments. And in short order, those two were laid in neat piles by the side of the large, palatial bathing system.<br />
<br />
He heard from a tour guide that these baths were operated by arcane pumps and systems constructed many years ago by a civilization much more adept in construction, and upkept by Construction Magi. He was thankful for them now for the chance to wash and deal with his problem.<br />
<br />
He stared for a minute at his nude, well muscled form in a body length mirror. Anson always said he was a very handsome man when he &quot;let his hair down&quot;, which he took too literally at times. But Bryndon did get it. His body was blessed by the light with strong, bulky muscles that served him well on the field...and made him target for such sexual yearnings by others. Even Lissa once or twice seemed affected by him, though she ALWAYS restrained herself.<br />
<br />
Bryndon started the water flowing into the large white tub, carved of brilliant stone, and slowly lowered himself into it...<br />
<br />
Fuck, he could still hear the couple going at it next door, however faintly. He almost felt jealous. Them getting to enjoy their time like this, enjoy each others&#39; bodies. The woman seemed to think her husband was well muscled. She should see me, some edge of Bryndon&#39;s conscience responded. He breathed harshly and as the tub filled up with warm water, Bryndon tried to meditate and put his mind at ease.<br />
<br />
But no matter what it seemed, he couldn&#39;t help himself but imagine the couple. He could almost see them.<br />
<br />
Covered in sweat, the man&#39;s hard cock plunging into his beloved...her voice urging him on, further and further. His ass pumping and flexing... Bryndon moaned, and clenched his shoulders. Why oh why was he so tempted? He considered his own manhood. Hard as a rock and sticking out of the water, a light little bubble of precum oozing out already. His own unit was almost ten inches long, and he always guessed he was well formed for a man there too.<br />
<br />
Not that he put much thought into using it just yet.<br />
<br />
Bryndon shook, thinking of what to do from here...</p>
