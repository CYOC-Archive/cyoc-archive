<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick “Snake” Rodriguez is a 16-year-old boy, he has a natural brown tan, brown eyes and short brown hair. He has an athletic built, due to his many sports activities, like Basketball, Soccer, Running, Skateboarding and much more. Everyone in school calls him “Snake”, he is the leader of the school’s bullies, and he and his gang enjoy giving the other students hell by harassing and threatening them. Snake’s favorite victim is Jeff, Jeff is a little weaker and at least a head smaller than most of the other boys in the school. The boy had also gotten himself the Chronivac-App, and he plans to use it on Jeff, Snake already knows what he wants Jeff to become: the boy had always wanted a dog, his favorite breed are the German Shepherd. Not only are German Shepherds loyal, but also extremely great guard dogs, when trained right. Snake decided to not have Jeff become a full-grown dog, he’d rather have Jeff become a eight week old puppy. The reason to this is, that a dog is more willing to learn stuff as a young pup and the training is easier and quicker than with a full-grown adult dog. Snake’s idea is to get Jeff alone somehow, then cause him to be unable to move, next he would transform Jeff into a one-year-old baby, which would be the same age as a eight-week-old pup. The bully also plans to take Jeff’s knowledge of speech, first to prevent Jeff from crying for help or to tell anybody what is going on, and second, Jeff would be barking and doing dog noises soon anyway. Once Jeff is a baby, Snake would take him with him, if asked, he’d simply say that the baby belonged to his sister, and that he had to watch over it all day, that is why he brought the baby to school. When he would have made it out of the school, Snake would take Jeff to his car and drive to the vets, to get his “dog” chipped, registered and vaccinated, but before entering the vet, he’d make the vet and everyone nearby think the baby were actually a 8-week-old German Shepherd puppy.<br />
<br />
Snake is smirking the whole time, as he looks at Jeff from time to time, while running his plan through his head. Everyone thinks he is stupid, but actually Snake is a very smart boy, which actually makes him pretty dangerous. Snake himself is happy with what he came up with, his plan is so fool proof, no one will find out anything. The only thing now is to wait for the best opportunity to get Jeff alone. Snake looks at the clock above the class room door, only 10 minutes until lunch break, knowing Jeff, the “loser” would be heading out to meet his friends at their meet up. Looking back at Jeff, Snake smirks evilly, knowing that Jeff won’t be turning up. Snake knows the route, he had been following Jeff for so long, so he knew where the best place would be to grab his soon-to-be puppy. Next to the school’s main building is a shed, where the caretaker stores his supplies, Snake had already the Janitor’s keys copied, so even if the shed would be locked, he could get in. The meeting spot of Jeff and his gang of “nerds” and “losers” is behind the main building of the school, no one else ventures back there, so Snake would have not to worry about any witnesses.<br />
<br />
Snake looks down at his phone, he already had scanned Jeff before class, so he had everything he needed to get started, he looks up at the clock, only five minutes left until the bell. “Sir, I need the toilette,” he says to the teacher, “would I be allowed to leave five minutes earlier?”<br />
<br />
The teacher looks at Rick, he then sighs, not in the mood for a discussion, “okay, fine,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sir,” Snake says, getting up from his seat and heading out of the classroom. Snake of course didn’t really need to relieve himself, he just wanted to leave earlier, so that he could ambush Jeff when the boy reaches the shed. The bully soon arrives at the shed, he hides behind it just as the bell rings, he smiles, it’ll take five minutes for Jeff to appear. Jeff is always the first to arrive at the meeting point, his friends always take their time, so Snake feels pretty relaxed, he’ll have Jeff paralyzed an in the shed before they even turn the corner. It does not take long and Snake hears footsteps approaching the shed, peering from behind it he smirks when he sees Jeff. Snake quickly takes out his phone and opens Jeff’s file, he then aims it at Jeff and hits the paralyze button, causing Jeff to suddenly stop dead in his tracks.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE HELL,” Jeff shouts out in surprise when he finds himself suddenly rooted to the ground, standing erect, his legs pinned together, and his arms pinned to his sides.<br />
<br />
 ‘Works like a charm,’ Snake thinks to himself grinning as steps out from behind the shed and into Jeff’s line of sight, “hello there, Jeffy-boy,” he then says, still grinning as he stops in front of the boy.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen in fear, knowing to well that Snake is not good business, “Sn-Snake… wh-what do you want,” he asks, “wh-why can’t I move? Is this y-your d-doing?”<br />
<br />
Snake continues to grin, “I actually do,” he says.<br />
<br />
“H-how…,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“THAT will stay MY secret,” Snake replies, “besides… you won’t even know the basics of math’s when I AM finished with you.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Snake’s grin turns into a smirk, “wouldn’t you like to know,” he says, “that to will remain my secret, for now at least. Now, before your friends see us together, we should go somewhere more private.” Jeff is about to protest when Snake suddenly just picks him up, being a scrawny boy, Jeff really does not weigh much. The bully then carries Jeff over to the shed, he puts Jeff down only for a second, to get out the key. Snake unlocks the shed and opens the door, he then grabs Jeff and enters the shed, closing the door behind them. A second after the door had closed, Jeff’s friends round the corner, unaware of the danger their friend is in. Once inside the shed, Snake sets Jeff in a corner next to a shelve and takes out his phone and starts to type something, Jeff opens his mouth to shout for help, but no noise escapes his lips. Jeff stares terrified at Snake, who smirks at him, “you think I&#39;d leave you here alone with the ability to call for help,” he asks, “I&#39;m not stupid. I have big plans for you, Jeffy-boy, but you have to wait until after school to find out.”<br />
<br />
Jeff can&#39;t believe what he is hearing, “Snake, are you really just going to leave me here,” he mouths wordlessly, “the caretaker will see me.”<br />
<br />
Snake&#39;s smirk grows, “you think I haven&#39;t thought about that,” he asks, “well, he WON&#39;T see you, because you&#39;ll be invisible.” The bully lifts his phone back to his face and types something, Jeff suddenly feels a weird tingling run through his body. Snake takes out a handheld mirror, which he brought along with him, and holds it up to Jeff&#39;s face. Jeff is horrified as he watches himself disappearing, soon his reflection is gone and there is no trace of Jeff in the shed. Snake puts the mirror back into his pocket and grins at the spot where Jeff is standing, “I&#39;ll see you after school,” he says and with that he leaves and Jeff hears the door lock behind Snake, leaving him all alone in the darkness.<br />
<br />
After Snake had left, Jeff tries to make sense of the situation and wonders what Snake has “planed” for him. ‘The only logical explanation I have for how Snake is able to do this kind of stuff is, that he also has a Chronivac-App on his phone,’ he thinks to himself, the boy becomes even more terrified at the thought, ‘I really want to get out of here, but I am totally screwed. No matter how hard I try, my body refuses to cooperate. I have no other choice than to stay put.’ So Jeff just stands there, in his corner, in the dark shed, invisible to anyone who’d enter the shed. The seconds, minutes and hours tick by slowly, Jeff even falls asleep a few times, until finally he hears the door to the shed unlock, dreading who’d enter, knowing it could only be a certain boy.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when the door opens, Jeff is greeted by the evil smirk of Snake, “hi there Jeffy-boy,” he says, knowing exactly where Jeff is standing. Snake closes the door and walks up to Jeff and stops a feet in front of him, “everyone has left,” the bully continues, “so it is just you and me, and maybe just a handful of students.” Jeff watches as Snake pulls out his phone, after typing into it, Jeff feels the tingling in his body and senses that Snake has made him visible again. The teen looks at Snake with fear in his eyes, “you seem to be afraid,” Snake says, “good, but I think you’ll enjoy what I have in mind in the end.” Jeff gives Snake a questionable look, “you’ll see soon enough,” Snake says, “and if you are wondering if anybody has asked about you, the answer is “no”. I guess everyone just assumed you were ditching school.” Snake continues to grin, “now, we have a lot to do, so no time to lose,” he says and lifts up his phone, “let’s start with the first step of my plan,” and he starts to type.<br />
<br />
Jeff again feels his body tingling all over, he looks at Snake, who smirks at him but says nothing. Suddenly Jeff feels as if there were two hands on his shoulders which start to push down, the boy’s eyes widen in shock, when he notices that Snake seems to become bigger. Jeff then notices that the workbench and everything within his line of sight, also seem to become bigger, then it hit him: it was HIM becoming smaller! Was Snake shrinking him? No… something else was going on. Jeff feels his clothes become baggier and baggier, until they fall to the ground around him.<br />
<br />
“So,” Snake says, when Jeff finally stops shrinking, “that is how you looked as a one-year-old? Pretty cute, I must say,” he grins down at the former 16-year-old, who stares up at the giant in fear and shock. “Well, I got to get you out of here somehow,” Snake explains, when seeing Jeff’s confused and shocked expression, “I could have simply shrunk you, but… it is part of my plan to have you become a baby. Now, we have an appointment with the… doctor,” he says, smirking at the confused expression on Jeff’s face. Snake picks up the “baby”, out of the pile of the oversized school uniform, and walks out of the shed and heads for the parking lot, with the naked baby in his arms.<br />
<br />
Jeff is still paralyzed, so he is unable to break free when Snake picks him up, helplessly Jeff can only watch as Snake carries him along the school grounds and towards the parking lot. When asked about the “baby”, Snake would simply say that he is watching over his sister’s baby boy. They soon arrive at the parking lot and Snake unlocks his car, a metallic blue 5 Series BMW, and lies the paralyzed “baby” on the back seat, then he drives off. Jeff has no idea, where the hell Snake is taking him, since he can only stare at the roof of the car he is in, ‘I can’t believe that I am being kidnapped by Snake and taken to some kind of doctor,’ he thinks to himself, ‘what sick joke is Snake planning this time? What kind of “doctor” will it be?’<br />
<br />
After driving for a while, which to Jeff feels like hours, Snake finally stops the car and turns of the engine. The bully turns around and grins at Jeff, “here we are,” he says, “I shall give you back your ability to move and talk, but there will be some tweaks. You will only be able to crawl, and when you talk, I will be able to understand you, BUT for the others you will only be barking and doing doggy noises.” Snake lets out a laugh, when he sees Jeff’s eyes widen, “whoooops, silly me,” he says, “I guess the surprise is out. Yes Jeffy-boy, you are going to become my good little obedient doggo.”</p>
