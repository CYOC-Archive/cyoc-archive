<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m coming&quot; Megan announced as she got into the backseat of Suzan&#39;s mom&#39;s car. Suzan&#39;s mother seemed to have a grin on her mouth. It was a bit of an awkward ride. Megan was there for support, but Suzan wasn&#39;t sure how to talk to her mother and felt a little betrayed by her mom still. After a decent length ride to the restaurant they went inside the small but very nice looking place. <br />
<br />
Menu in hand Suzan&#39;s mother Denora said &quot;Go ahead and order whatever you want and as much as you want.&quot;<br />
Megan and Suzan were quite so Shawna said &quot;Denora, we don&#39;t really eat sushi. Maybe it&#39;d be better if you just order for us?&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll pick for us.&quot; Denora said as she flagged the waiter and said &quot;The regular but 4 times as many.&quot; she then grinned and said &quot;So I&#39;m your mother Suzy, you must have so many questions go ahead and ask as many as you&#39;d like?&quot; Suzan tried to think of something. Why did you leave me with mom? Well that was so I could be raised like a human... It&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t paying child support or anything... Now she&#39;d obviously want to be with me for a bit to show that she&#39;s actually here... <br />
&quot;Do you still feel human?&quot; Suzan asked. With the timeline the way it was it was pretty obvious that her parents were first generation dragons, but she wasn&#39;t sure if she should have really asked that question. <br />
&quot;Do I still feel human?&quot; Denora wondered out loud. &quot;Well I feel a lot more human after learning that shapeshifting trick you learned in your first minute of life. Sometimes my dragon instincts take over a little, but I still feel like who I always was.&quot; then she pondered a bit more before asking &quot;Is this about a feeling of isolation?&quot;<br />
Suzan said &quot;I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ve always felt a bit different but... Now I know I really am different, and I&#39;m not sure if that knowledge is going to change me. I didn&#39;t even notice I was biting through a chicken bone...&quot;<br />
Denora chuckled a bit and said &quot;That very much reminded me when I originally changed. So much fear, uncertainty, and everyone around you is scared you&#39;re going to incinerate them. Really knowing you&#39;re a dragon may give you a sense of superiority or confidence, but you are who you are.&quot;<br />
Shawna nodded and said &quot;After the shock came over... I saw that she was more or less the same. and I&#39;m not sure how much she&#39;s really changed.&quot; <br />
Denora chuckled some more &quot;Ah, comeon I look so much better now that I&#39;m not in the form of a giant monster. No offense my little daughter.&quot; Some of the food started coming out, and it was some rather high quality sushi. Although 3 out of the 4 people at the table couldn&#39;t appreciate that very much. &quot;No No! You dip it just a little with the soy sauce.&quot; Denora tried to correct Suzan in how she was eating the sushi. <br />
Shawna trying to make a conversation asked &quot;So, what happened at school today?&quot; <br />
Suzan said &quot;Classes were alright, Mr. Blanchki in social studies was a little weird... I got a special coach for P.E. a Harpy named Stacy.&quot; Denora smirked for a second. There only being so many harpys there was only really one known as Stacy. <br />
Megan said &quot;Come on Suzan, you&#39;re not going to talk about Kris?&quot;<br />
Denora smirked harder as Shawna asked &quot;You met a boy?&quot;<br />
Suzan blushed a bit as Megan said &quot;Yeah a swimmer boy who happened to be a lamia.&quot; <br />
Denora chuckled a little and said &quot;Aw, that&#39;s cute.&quot; <br />
&quot;He was just seeing if I was alright. Reaching out monster to monster...&quot; Suzan muttered. <br />
Denora ate on more piece of sushi as she said &quot;This weekend we should probably go to a special spa I know made specifically for Dragons and other monsters that can withstand the treatments.&quot; <br />
Suzan asked &quot;Um... why?&quot; <br />
&quot;You know, try to bond a little bit after such a long time... And I find after being in this form for too long my body feels a little cramped and needs a good stretch. I figure since you were in your human form for most of your life you&#39;d want to get your dragon form really taken care of.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll think about it...&quot; Suzan said as she went to eating a few pieces of sushi without soy sauce again. Suzan for sure was getting a small read on her mother, and Suzan felt like she should reserve judgement till her emotions were a little more stable... Although that was pretty hard since her emotions weren&#39;t stable. <br />
<br />
Tired, and having been transported back after a relatively uneventful remaining of the evening Suzan was back in her room. In her nudity Suzan was curious about something, and her form rippled a little bit and now she seemed to be wearing a pain dress. Upon further inspection while the dress felt like a dress it was also kinda fused with her skin. A little weird but it looked close enough that Suzan thought she could probably get by with her magic clothes now, and not even need to waste any money on the dumb human... Suzan looked at her reflection again and wondered if she really was distancing herself from humanity. The only one&#39;s she really cared about was Megan and Mommy... but they&#39;d like her no matter what she was right? The soft flesh of Suzan&#39;s body turned to hard blue scales, her face elongated taking on more draconic features. The person in the reflection was unfamiliar, but felt more true to who she was. She took in a deep breath and some holes appeared in her magic dress that some wings grew out of. She stretched them out, and then fished for her phone. She decided to text her mom about accepting the spa thing before shifting into a smaller version of her actual form before laying on her bed like a dog. Whether or not she was rejecting humanity Suzan was feeling that embracing her dragon self was probably the right call.</p>
