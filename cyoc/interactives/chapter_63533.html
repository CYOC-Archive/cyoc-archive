<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next few weeks, things rapidly began to settle down many of the conflicts that Molly an I had gone through in Columbia Falls. A lot of it was shocking to me in some ways. Ever since Changes first injected Molly and tried to get her to join the Animatrix Fun House, I had taken it upon myself to be her defender. Her protector. I had assumed that if anyone showed the people of the small town that Molly was not one to be feared, it would be me.<br />
<br />
Yet it wasn't myself who sparked the change in people's views. It was Molly. By killing the mundane Mountain Lion that had attacked Megan Jenkins, and then offering the wounded girl her own blood, Molly had showed a degree of selflessness that I had been unable to manage. Most of the incidents that I had been involved in did not have such an issue or didn't give me the opportunity. Ebenezer Smith and his son were apprehended easily with little or no danger in the end. The son had taken a few shots in my direction when Officer Barnes and I had arrived, but it was Officer Barnes who got the son to put down his weapon before he could aim it properly. When we had discovered that their call was nothing but an elaborate scheme, they were both caught.<br />
<br />
The next big case ended up being the arrest of Beauregard himself. With the gang he had hired essentially deciding to cooperate, we had gotten evidence that linked him to the attack on Leona's lab by that gang. The search of his property confirmed the connection and linked R.A.M. as an organization to it. Beauregard's arrest would break R.A.M. and would see it fragment, which was good for Molly and I. But, the heroes of that case ended up being Frank Rhoer and one of his daughters, as Beauregard had shot Officer Barnes at the end of the incident, and they were the ones who not only saved me from being shot, but helped save my partner as well.<br />
<br />
The last major case had been the result of the break up of R.A.M. over the murder of one of Beauregard's friends. I had been assigned to work with Danielle Jenkins while Officer Barnes recovered. The crook, Dusty MacClure, was again caught, but not by anything I had done. He had attempted to tackle Officer Jenkins to either get away or to beat her up and then get away, leaving me to care for her. Officer Jenkins, however, was far from being weak and incapable and kneed the man in the groin, which allowed us to bring him into custody.<br />
<br />
The next incident occurred after Dusty MacClure had gone to trial or after it had completed. The biological father of Officer Jenkins' young daughter, Megan, had showed up in Columbia Falls and foolishly decided to take the girl as if she were in danger from her mother. I did play a bigger role in catching him, as he seemed to fear my approach and kept his focus on me. In doing so he tripped backward over a parking bump and released Megan. She had been friendly with me, but it seemed clear that much of that was because of Molly's work as a teacher's aide at the school.<br />
<br />
All of the kids seemed to love Molly, whom they affectionately called &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot;. It was an odd nickname that seemed better suited to a superhero to me then to a non-superhero, but it was used with affection and seemed to give the children of Columbia Falls a great love for the two striped cats that now resided there. Parents could see that their kids loved Molly, and over time generally saw that Molly never threatened them. The kids went to school and went home without sustaining injuries. And when the attack came to the school, it was Molly who risked her life to save a student and risked her career to keep her alive. Far more then anything I had done in the same period of time, as Molly's actions finally served to break the mistrust that seemed to linger over Columbia Falls, even after R.A.M. as an institution went down with Beauregard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it's all interesting,&quot; I commented as Molly and I ate breakfast one morning...<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot; Molly asked in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;How things have gone,&quot; I commented, &quot;when you think about it... the real hero of our own personal saga... the one who's helped us gain acceptance here... was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's a bad thing?&quot; Molly retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; I shook my head, &quot;it's just that I'd thought I'd be the one to show everyone that you were no one to be mindlessly afraid of. That despite the instinctual changes, you were like everyone else... in a way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your inner knight consumes you,&quot; Molly chuckled, &quot;though even if you took our instincts away, it's pretty clear that we aren't like everyone else. We are taller, stronger, and heavier then any person here... in terms of muscle mass, anyway. We have claws and teeth that are not present on anyone else in this state. We have tails. We're covered in fur, our ears are on the top of our heads... we both lost our human hair...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
Molly nodded and then took a sip of water through a straw and settled into her breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean when all of this started and we had to deal with all these people being so rude and inconsiderate to you because of what Changes did... did you think that it would ultimately be you that turns everything around?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;I figured it'd be a long road and people would realize that I was a victim... but not so suddenly from one action to save a kid... I mean that is something anyone would do. Not just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that's what did it,&quot; I commented, &quot;You did something that people assumed any person would do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't make any sense,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it does,&quot; I replied, &quot;I mean... a lot of people have treated you like a mundane animal. They've done the same with me after my transformation. They've assumed that we now lack human qualities. And then that Mountain Lion attacked and you did something that people assumed only a person would do. Save the child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So saving Megan finally convinced them that I'm a person?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And showed everyone just how wrong they've been,&quot; I nodded, &quot;I mean, how many people have come up to you and apologized over the past few weeks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least a dozen,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Including one of the other teachers at the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; I gave a soft smile between bites of eggs, &quot;their signs were right. YOU are the hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George...&quot; Molly answered, probably blushing under her fur, sounding clearly uneasy with all the praise.<br />
<br />
We continued to eat and get ready for our respective jobs.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Things at work also seemed to cool down. From what Molly told me in the evenings, she was doing fairly well as a substitute for Mrs. Fitzpatrick who had been promoted to principal as part of the latest &quot;incident&quot;. She followed her predecessor's lesson plans and rarely needed to do much in the way of discipline. As she told me, it mostly came from a rather simple scheme that manipulated the kids' love for the &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot;. If you're good in class, the Tiger Lady will let you play and climb on her at recess... as well as apparently giving kids rides on her back like she was a horse or pony, which the kinds loved, according to what Molly told me at night.<br />
<br />
For me, things had also quieted down at work. Now, as a police officer, quiet did not mean that nothing necessarily happened. From my point of view, it simply meant that there were no major car accidents, murders, serious drug related problems, or wild animals coming into town. Most of what had to be dealt with were various speeding tickets, traffic violations, and the occasional drunk driving &quot;arrests&quot;. Things that were considered rather routine for any officer of the law.<br />
<br />
As I made my way into the station, I met Officer Barnes and Officer Jenkins discussing a few things as they clocked in for the day themselves. Much of it related to how Megan was doing after the attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; I spoke as I approached and clocked in for the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, George,&quot; Officer Jenkins said in a friendly manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Wayne,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded, using the formal business like tone he always used when on duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any instructions for the day?&quot; I asked as I finished clocking in.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we can go straight to the morning patrol,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded and then turned to Officer Jenkins, &quot;we'll see you at lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins nodded as we headed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how's Megan been doing?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing well, and healing awfully fast,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;the metabolic rate thingy you mentioned up at your cabin.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;She still enjoys school, and says that the teachers have been very accommodating to her after everything,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;and added that several kids look jealous that she got become a tiger person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly only did that to save her life,&quot; I answered, &quot;we didn't move here with Molly to raise an army of tiger cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm not arguing,&quot; Officer Barnes chuckled, &quot;I'm just saying that she thinks some of the kids are jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged and climbed into the back seat of our patrol car. Another side effect of the kids' loving the Tiger Lady, I guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her stitches come out yet?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for a couple of days,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged as we began our morning patrol, &quot;the doctor is still being a bit of a jerk about all of it... but since the City Council realized the mistakes they'd made, he has had no legal ground to try anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's probably more due to the lawsuit that Leona... now Leon, lost about whether or not the Animatrix Serum should be distributed commercially,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged, &quot;and I've heard a lot about that they're branching out on the news... the sex changing formula you mentioned.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;It'll probably save people a fortune on surgeries that could go bad... and if someone is truly desiring to be the opposite gender... it'll give them the full experience. New women can get pregnant... new men have all the equipment needed to sire their own line of children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes nodded, &quot;anyway, it's made sure he can't simply turn Megan down because she's a tiger cub now... but he still wants to be careful and make sure everything is one hundred percent better.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded in agreement. Megan Jenkins was the daughter of Officer Danielle Jenkins, and while the station's desk officer was in a somewhat serious relationship with my partner, Officer Barnes was not her father... at least not genetically. In terms of the things that made someone a good parent or not, I was privately certain that Megan considered my partner her father more then the man who actually sired her. Which was a good thing, in my book.<br />
<br />
She had been attacked by the Mountain Lion and became a Bengal Tiger cub-person after receiving a blood transfusion from Molly, as the two shared a blood type. Both Officer Barnes and Officer Jenkins told me on how they were doing. A lot of the hunting instincts were there, and from what I'd been told, Megan had been taking to pouncing or pursing various things in a very playful mood. So far, Garter Snakes and butterflies seemed to be her top targets. The most exciting story occurred a day or two before she was allowed to go back to school. A rabbit or hare had gotten into their yard and Danielle's young transformed daughter marched out and tried to catch it... the rabbit saw her coming out the back door and bolted before Megan made it onto the lawn.<br />
<br />
It was all interesting, and I enjoyed the stories on how Megan was adjusting to being a tiger cub. My interest was to make sure that Molly and I could step in to help, if need be, but so far that hadn't been necessary. Both Officer Barnes and Officer Jenkins looked at the websites I'd suggested that would be helpful for them to understand tigers, and even found an online copy of one of the books I'd found during my original search to help Molly. And from time to time, it stimulated some good conversation on mundane tigers and their behavior. I found that to interesting as gave us a subject to talk about other then work and related subjects.<br />
<br />
And overall, it was leading to a rather pleasant life for Molly and I. The only thing needed on that front was Molly's certification to teach, and that was supposed to be in the mail.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The day went buy quietly with only a few minor and routine calls for Officer Barnes and I. I clocked out and wished Officer Barnes and Jenkins a good evening as they headed home where Megan and Megan's grandmother were likely waiting for them. The couple of times that Molly and I had seen Megan with Danielle Jenkins and Frederick Barnes had reinforced the desire in Molly and myself to have children of our own. For Molly it seemed to instinctual, almost. Like her mind was geared to have cubs. I wanted children too, but some of that may have been from how I had looked at family relations when I was human, though I did have to admit to Molly that I found the new Megan to be cute.<br />
<br />
Bandhavgarh Cabin was quiet as I approached it. The lights were on, so I knew Molly was home, but things seemed to be deathly silent as I approached. At first I thought something was wrong, and I rushed in to check on Molly. I found her standing just inside the front door as I came in. She was in fact so close to the door that I nearly barreled into her as I came in. Seeing that she wasn't hurt, I quickly settled down a bit. In doing so, I noticed she was grinning, practically from one cheek to the other, and in her hands was a large business envelope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly, are you okay?&quot; I asked, although my eyes captivated by the envelope.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Fitzpatrick had done some work to get Molly's time as her aide recognized as her student teaching, and when combined with her college degree, it would automatically qualify her for certification as a teacher. Was this envelope it? And if so, did it work? Was Molly certified?<br />
<br />
&quot;Better then okay,&quot; Molly smiled, &quot;I'm wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that...?&quot; I began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;IT IS!&quot; Molly said in such an excited tone that the power of our vocal cords was forgotten and she leaped into my arms and began nuzzling my muzzle with hers, &quot;It is! My certification came in! Mrs. Fitzpatrick's recommendations went to the state's Department of Education in Helena, Montana's state school, and to our college! And it came in! I am officially certified to teach here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm happy for you,&quot; I answered and hugged her back.<br />
<br />
It was slightly difficult for us to do this as human sized dwellings weren't suited to beings of our height, but it was manageable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get full benefits, sick days, maternity leave, paid vacation,&quot; Molly began to list the things she'd get as a certified teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;A higher salary,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That too,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;but I'm not doing this for money. Just as you don't protect people for money. You do it to show you're just as good a man as your father...&quot;<br />
<br />
And Molly paused to grip my head in her paw-like hands, pressing the envelope into one side of my head. I gazed into her greenish-gold eyes with my own as she smiled and then nuzzled my muzzle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to me... you will always be the best man ever,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;the most wonderful... the best there is... and MINE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; I chuckled and nuzzled her back.<br />
<br />
Things were going quite well, and I was happy for Molly. She went to school to teach, and while school allowed her to finish out the year and graduate after her transformation, no one had let her student teach while in college. The most cited reason was that the schools that had been asked refused out of fear that Molly would &quot;eat&quot; the kids there. And without the certification, she could never teach... unless the state didn't carry a requirement that a teacher be certified. And since we didn't know for sure which states did and did not, Molly had decided when we had started college to earn the certification to be safe. It was one of the things that frustrated her heavily after her transformation.<br />
<br />
But now... now that had been fixed at last. Molly had her certification and she could teach on her own. And it made her happy, so, I was thus happy.</p>
