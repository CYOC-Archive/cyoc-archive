<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You hear a knock at the door and stand up from your desk with its books to answer it. You open the door of your uni accomodation and nobody&#39;s there, but there&#39;s a box lying in front of your door. You pick it up, and close the door walking back into your apartment.<br />
<br />
&#10022; &#10022; &#10022; <br />
<br />
Half an hour later, you&#39;ve read the booklet that was included in the package that explained what the other thing in the package was, the Chronivac. It&#39;s plugged into your computer and is currently showing a digitally rendered model of you on the right hand side of your computer, and boxes with information and measurements on the left. You were stuck wondering what to do with this, then looked at the clock and saw that you had a physics lecture in 10 minutes. You downloaded the Chronivac Program onto your computer, ejected the physical Chronivac device and hid it in a drawer, then grabbed your bag and hauled ass to university.<br />
<br />
&#10022; &#10022; &#10022;<br />
<br />
Sitting in, you were hardly able to focus on the topics your teacher was discussing, thinking about the power of the computer in your bag. Looking around like you do whenever you&#39;re bored in class, your eyes stop on Abe Jackson. a hot 20 year old that goes to your university and is in all your classes and your dorm building.He was a mammoth of a man, standing at a towering 6&quot; 5&#39;, it seemed like every part of him was scaled up. He had amazing muscles, with pecs that jutted out from his chest, and meaty thighs. His rigid face, blond hair and strong jawline only gave people more reason to have a crush on him.. Every girl that met him seemed like they were one second from getting on their knees to suck his dick. Despite this, he remained single as he was arrogant and cocky. He is the leader of the hot group of guys because he was the hottest, he was all around perfect. You have harboured a crush on him since you first saw him in your history class, and had fantasised about him in every way possible.<br />
Your eyes turn back to the front of the class and your hands unzip your bag, grabbing and opening your computer. The screen that greets you is the Chronivac, and you click the button to scan the area for targets, and a map of the room with the people in it shows up, and you click on Abe.<br />
Thinking of what your first change should be, you are struck with an idea. You go into the mental tab, and make him remove his clothes until he&#39;s completely naked. You also check a box which means that nobody else will realise that he&#39;s naked, or think that anything’s out of the normal. You also made it so Abe wouldn&#39;t have a second thought about being naked in class, and clicked the confirmation button.<br />
<br />
&#10022; &#10022; &#10022;<br />
<br />
Looking over, Abe grabbed the bottom of his shirt and pulled it over his head, taking it off and dropping it on the floor, allowing for his muscles to be on display. He then reached down to undo his shoes and took them off as well, taking off his socks as well. He then unbuckled his belt and pulled it back out through the loops, letting his now loose pants fall to the ground. He stepped out of the pants that now rest on the floor, and you had a great view of his ass and thighs, and the large noticeable bulge that was struggling to be contained in his briefs. Watching as Abe took off his final piece of clothing, his black pair of briefs that hugged his thighs, he dropped them onto the pile of clothes that was already next to him, then sat back down.<br />
This was the first time you had ever seen Abe fully nude, and you were enjoying it. Looking at his body you looked at his meaty pecs, which lay above his 6 pack. His biceps were perfectly sculpted, and his hands were big and firm, but smooth. Under his arms there lay a light amount of brown armpit hair. Then there was his penis, it was massive. You knew that he was a bit of a man-whore from stories around the uni, but you never heard of his endowment. It was around 8 inches, and his balls were the size of eggs underneath. It was surrounded by brown curly pubes which led up in between his 6 pack to his belly button. Below his third leg were his thighs, which were thick and juicy, just like his ass, and they were covered in a light amount of hair. His calves were to die for, and his feet were large with a light smattering of hair on the top.<br />
Looking back at your computer you see that the change is done, and now the only question is what to do next.</p>
