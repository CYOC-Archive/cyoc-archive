<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One week later and Dustin was really getting settled in Cody&#39;s old body. Old, younger body. He had made a few changes though, the long slicked back undercut had been replaced with a short crew cut, and he had let that stubble on his jaw grow out into a week&#39;s worth of beard he had only trimmed and groomed for the first time this morning. That took some learning, he knew how to shave but his old body couldn&#39;t grow a decent beard to save it&#39;s life. That wasn&#39;t the only shaving he stopped, hopping that Cody&#39;s Italian heritage had come with some hairy genes. He wasn&#39;t disappointed, he had a jackpot, hairy in just the right places. Cody must have spent a good deal of time keeping himself smooth, there was no hair on Dustin&#39;s shoulders and back, but he had a nice curly coating across his pecs and down his six pack, thick bushes in his pits, he did have to trim down those pubes though, they grew in fast and thick. The day after the court hearing he went to get his nipples pierced just as he wanted. They were still a little sore but he loved the was the two silvery rings stood out against his dark chest hair.<br />
<br />
He had taken the body from Guido to young muscle bear in a week. He kept working at his job which had been work from home since the accident, and now added in a daily work out with a personal trainer to learn to keep this body. He had even avoided sexual encounters up to this point, well, other than a particularly vigorous make out session with his trainer which he promised to finish another time. He wanted everything to be right for the first time in this new body.<br />
<br />
But he had a plan for a little bit more revenge on Cody, it wasn&#39;t enough to have taken his body from him, no... he wanted him to know what his body was doing. So here he sat on a leather couch, two cameras pointed at him with a man in his mid-thirties seated between. He was good looking, with slicked back blond hair and a lean swimmers build. He had a clipboard on his lap, looking like any other professional ready to conduct an interview. Clyde Green was his name, and he was a porn star turned porn producer.<br />
<br />
Clyde started, &quot;Well, let&#39;s get started, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t mind if I film this. Name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin Jacobson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.. doesn&#39;t really fit the look, we&#39;ll have to come up with something a little more... Italian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Santoni?&quot; Dustin offered with a wry grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.. I like that. Dustin Santoni. Why don&#39;t you get stripped, let me see what I&#39;m working with. While you do that, tell me why you want to do porn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde was watching Dustin like a hawk as he stood up and began to unbutton his blue dress shirt. Dustin was purposefully taking his time, stretching the disrobing into a little bit of a strip tease. He knew he was probably being judged on how he performed as well. &quot;I&#39;m just looking for something different to do, something exciting..&quot; The shirt came undone, exposing his furry chest and stomach. He let his shirt fall of his shoulders and tossed it aside, using the opportunity to flex those well-defined muscular arms of his. He began working at his belt and pants fly. &quot;I&#39;ve got a body people seem to enjoy looking at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not modelling or acting?&quot; Clyde asked, though his eyes were riveted on Dustin&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have other assets I think I bring to the table.&quot; Dustin said with another smile as he pulled off his pants. He wore a tight pair of boxer-briefs the pair he had that best showed the massive bulge between his legs. His smile widened as he saw Clyde&#39;s brows go up at the bulge. Dustin took his sweet time getting his underwear off and letting the seven inches of flaccid cock swing free, his egg sized balls swaying behind it. He hefted it with one hand and grinned his cockiest grin. A spin motion from Clyde had Dustin turning slowly in a circle for the camera, he slapped his own ass as it faced the camera. He had a good butt, too, firm, round, and just the lightest coating of fuzz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assets.&quot; Clyde shook his head, but looked amused. &quot;Let&#39;s see those assets in action. Do it for the camera, not like you&#39;re at home.&quot; He tapped one of the cameras with the tip of his pen. &quot;And while you do, tell me what kind of shots you&#39;re willing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin say back down on the couch, one elbow propped on the back of the couch as he played with his nipple, his other hand stroking slowly at his flaccid cock, bringing it to attention. It did so quickly, waking up like a dragon, lifting its head and stretching out. &quot;Gay porn. Pretty much anything with another guy, I&#39;ll do group stuff as long as there&#39;s another guy present.&quot; Eight inches, nine, his cock stretched to it&#39;s full ten inches. Even Dustin had been shocked the first time he brought it to erection and measured it. This was the real treasure he got in the body swap.<br />
<br />
He spread his legs so the camera got a good view of his heavy balls laying against the couch as he took his shaft in both hand, one hand working the base, the other just below the head. Dustin had seen enough big dick porn to recreate what he saw. &quot;As for what.. I&#39;m not picky. I&#39;ll top, I&#39;ll bottom. Orgies, gang bangs, spit roast me on two cocks..&quot; He shrugs. Pre was dribbling out the top of his cock now. The thing was super sensitive and Dustin was still getting used to it. He was trying to hold back, but he hadn&#39;t learned to control his new massive tool yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And anything you won&#39;t do?&quot; Clyde was leaning forward now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scat.. watersports..&quot; Dustin said with a shrug. He could feel his balls churning. &quot;Maybe if I was offered enough.&quot; He could feel the pressure building up, ready to go. &quot;Anything with just women. I need a sexy man around to really get going..&quot; He looked at Clyde with a smirk as his cock finally erupted. Some hit the wall behind his head, more cum splashed into his chest hair, more landed on the couch. It was in impressive display of quantity if not aim.<br />
<br />
He scooped the cum off his chest and stuck it in his mouth, even as Clyde was lofting a towel towards him. &quot;Well, you&#39;ll take some work to get to a professional level, but for an amateur, you&#39;re not bad. And you got a body most castings would kill for. That cock alone is worth taking a chance on you. Be here Thursday at 9 am, we&#39;ll have you sign some papers and then I have an amateur shoot that afternoon. Little locker room scene I need three for. I&#39;ll pay you a grand for about three hours work for the shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A grand and two copies of the shoot when it&#39;s done.&quot; Dustin countered. &quot;I want that in my contract if possible. Two copies of anything I shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde just laughed. &quot;One of those who likes to watch yourself work, huh? Fine.. but why two.. never mind.&quot; Clyde shook his head like he was used to weird requests. &quot;Done.&quot; Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out two hundred dollars, setting it down on the table in front of him.<br />
<br />
Dustin raised a brow curiously, and Clyde nodded to the cameras. &quot;I hate wasting good footage. I can cut this down to a five minute big-dicked amateur masturbates&#39; post it online and make some cash. That&#39;s your pay for the shoot. I will never not pay my actors. I may ride your ass like a daddy-bear on Viagra, but I&#39;ll always treat you fair. I&#39;ll get your two copies of this to you when it&#39;s done. I look forward to working with you Dustin Santoni. I&#39;ll send someone in to take you to the showers so you can get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Clyde switched off the cameras and left the room, leaving Dustin there naked, sticky, and two hundred dollars richer.</p>
