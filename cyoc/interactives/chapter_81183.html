<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was ready to leave the Chronivac alone, when he came up with an idea. What if only one member of the <br />
family was getting older? How would that affect their relationships and lives? He opened the time acceleration <br />
mode again and switched to the advanced options. Sure enough, you could choose to change the flow of time for <br />
individual people. Should he choose himself? Although he'd like to see how he'd look when he reached Simon's <br />
age, maybe he'd do that another time. He wanted to be an observer for once. He can't make Bryan or Simon older <br />
as they were both already so old. The sudden appearance of his nephew Danny did seem to mix things up a bit. <br />
Maybe he should see the boy become middle aged throughout the day. But wouldn't Jay notice that his son <br />
suddenly became their brother? Although Mark had adjusted his awareness of the situation for Jay, he was still <br />
pretty suspicious of the changes Mark had made, which had thrown a spanner in their brotherly relationship. <br />
<br />
Mark thought about it and realised this could present an interesting situation. What if he made both Danny and <br />
Jay age throughout the day? Mark thought it would be surreal to have his twin become his older brother, then <br />
his uncle. Likewise, his nephew would become his cousin. It all sounded so fairytale and fictional and yet he <br />
could make that happen. Maybe Jay would make a better uncle than a twin, and he'd never had a cousin before. <br />
Or maybe he did before he joined the family. He was finding it harder to remember his previous life, but <br />
that's was in his past now. Why worry about it? He clicked on Jay and Danny's names and thought about how old <br />
to make them. If he stuck to the previous format of one hour equalling a year, Danny would be 36 and Jay would <br />
be 64. He didn't want Jay to become too old, but he wanted Danny to become even older. After some quick maths, <br />
he'd adjusted their individual time acceleration at Jay aging 20 years a day (or 1 year every 72 minutes) and <br />
Danny aging at 30 years a day (or 1 year every 48 minutes). Just before clicking agree, he'd decided with a <br />
twinge of regret to change Jay's awareness to the same as Bryan's, which is to say he wouldn't be aware at <br />
all. He was getting too suspicious in the day and he wouldn't want to anger him more once he became an old <br />
man. However he also changed Danny's awareness to the point Jay's was previously, wondering how an &quot;outsider&quot; <br />
would react to knowing something was up with his life, without previously knowing what the Chronivac did. With <br />
a bit of hesitation, he clicked accept and the Chronivac did its work, the wave-like energy bursting forth, <br />
though Mark didn't feel anything this time. He turned the Chronivac off and went back to his room, briefly <br />
bumping into his father on the way. Luckily the bathroom was opposite Simon's room so he didn't rouse <br />
suspicion. They exchanged goodnights and went to bed.<br />
<br />
Jay woke up early that morning with a headache. Maybe he should cut down on his drinking now he was in his <br />
40s. It sounded so weird to him. In his 40s. His younger brother was 40 so he couldn't deny he was getting <br />
old. He got out of bed, the springs squeaking loudly as they were released from his bulk, and made his way to <br />
the bathroom. He stared at his face in the mirror, seeing a 45 year old man. He hadn't aged well, his face <br />
round and saggy, bags appearing under his eyes. His trimmed beard was almost completely colorless now, not <br />
even attempting to hide his second chin, and what was left of his hair was steadily turning grey as well. His <br />
eyes looked tired between the weathered creases surrounding them. He shook his big hairy belly and it jiggled <br />
about. Was this what having a mid life crisis was like? His son had already graduated from high school and was <br />
working with him, his brother and father in the auto-repair shop. It only felt like yesterday that he was in <br />
his 20s. He sighed and got in the shower to clean up. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Danny had woken from his own slumber, scratching his stubbly cheeks. He froze suddenly, since when <br />
did he have to shave? He was only a kid. But no, he wasn't. He was almost 20 now, and he'd inherited his dad's <br />
high testosterone levels. He'd been shaving since he was 14 near enough. He must of been remembering a dream <br />
of his, and yet his whole body didn't feel right. Standing up, he wobbled a bit on his large feet, now the <br />
tallest man in the family. His height gave him a better spread for his weight so he didn't look as large as <br />
his relatives at this age. In fact, he was in a healthy shape. Not as healthy as his uncle, but he tried to <br />
keep up. He itched his chest which was covered with hair that many men his age would be envious of and went to <br />
the bathroom, finding his dad was already in there. They really needed more than one in the house seeing how <br />
there were 5 men sharing it, but they couldn't afford a new one. It wasn't long before his dad had finished <br />
and let him in, squeezing past back to his own room. Danny frowned, his dad looked different somehow but he <br />
couldn't quite place it. Maybe he'd lost weight? No, he'd probably gained some. He was about the same size as <br />
his great grandfather was back when he was younger based on the pictures he'd seen. Danny entered the bathroom <br />
and got to shaving his face, leaving a wide strip along the bottom of his face hairy as he was trying to grow <br />
it out, which wasn't a hard feat given his genetics. He fiddled with his hair, which had steadily receded by a <br />
couple of inches. It wasn't too noticeable if he combed his hair forward, yet it was obvious he'd follow the <br />
rest of his family. He wanted to shave his head like his uncle Mark, but his dad had told him it was a coward <br />
move and to embrace his hairline like the rest of his family. Maybe in a few years he'd have the courage to <br />
shave it. He sighed and got in the shower to clean up.<br />
<br />
Mark had woken up, still as a 40 year old and looked out of his bedroom door. He saw Jay leave the bathroom, <br />
looking older than ever, while a young hairy man went in. He remembered what he did last night and said good <br />
morning to his brother, who smiled at him, but it was a sad smile. He wondered what was wrong until he saw <br />
Simon in his doorway looking confused. Mark went over to him and said &quot;Hey dad, what's up? You look like <br />
you've seen a ghost&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simon looked at his son and said &quot;Oh sorry, I was just thinking about how grown up Danny is now, already <br />
growing his first beard. It's a weird goatee, but it suits him&quot;. Mark smiled and went down to make beakfast <br />
while Simon went back to his room. He had seen what Mark had seen, his eldest son leaving the bathroom so his <br />
grandson could enter. But Jay was 45 and he was 60 which meant he was only 15 when Jay came into the world. He <br />
was so young, but it didn't feel right. His grandson was looking older as well. He couldn't place why <br />
everything felt so wrong. Maybe the Chronivac was malfunctioning, he hadn't even checked on the device since <br />
starting this simulation. It felt so long ago now. He couldn't even believe he was 60, his face was lined with <br />
age and his eyes were dim with age, now needing glasses to see close up. He'd stopped shaving his head <br />
recently because he was afraid of cutting himself now his hands were a bit shaky. Plus Bryan was now 80. 80 <br />
years old! He didn't even seem to remember anything of their previous life at all, which could be due to his <br />
advanced age. He always joked about how close he was to the grave but it wasn't that funny. He had to retire <br />
from the shop after getting arthritis in his joints, and he lost all his teeth to gingivitis. The man needed a <br />
hearing aid and was practically blind now, even with his glasses. He couldn't even walk about without his <br />
cane. The only bright side was he'd lost a lot of weight recently, yet that was only due to getting ill and <br />
losing his appetite. It almost killed the man. Simon was having to spend more time at home looking after his <br />
father than working in the shop. He was glad that his grandson was old enough to work there now so they <br />
weren't so overstretched. He let out a deep sigh, wondering how his life came to this. He glanced over to the <br />
Chronivac. Maybe it was time to do something.</p>
