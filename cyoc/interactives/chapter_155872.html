<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It would seem that Simon&#39;s revenge on his neglectful former father, John, was now complete. John was no longer the man of the house. Simon had taken that role and every aspect of John&#39;s former life. That included being the father as John had been, quite literally, reborn as the biological son of Simon and Kim. With their places full reversed, one would think that the changes had stopped.<br />
<br />
But Simon had set up the Chronivac to do more than switch him and John. Simon perceived John as a neglectful and abrasive father and Kim wasn&#39;t a much better mother. Both of them seemed unwilling to help Simon out with anything, including his homework. They also seemed to like to ground Simon at every opportunity. The Chronivac may be finished with John, but it was just starting with Kim. She may now be Simon&#39;s wife and the mother of John, but she wasn&#39;t going to stay that way. Simon had set the Chronivac to start draining her age much like John. In a few days, Kim will become Simon&#39;s daughter and he would have a better wife to take her place.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Simon woke up, trying to remember what happened last night. His setting of the Chronivac made his awareness fainter than it was when it had started. Often times, he would forget that there was any changes going on, but a small presence in the back of his mind would make him notice the differences. For instance, he could recall John being reborn last night, though it seemed more like a dream. He also felt more energetic, as if he hadn&#39;t completely aged back up from conceiving his now 12-year old son.<br />
<br />
Movement on the bed reminded Simon he wasn&#39;t alone. Looking over at Kimberly, he vaguely noticed that she hadn&#39;t aged up at all. If anything, she looked a little younger than before they went to sleep. But that was alright with Simon, he liked her younger, sexier body. Kim opened her eyes and gave her husband a loving smile. &quot;Morning, Simon,&quot; she said, &quot;Are you complete awake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m up,&quot; said Simon, a little groggily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Kim teasingly, sitting up in bed, letting the covers fall away from her naked body.<br />
<br />
Simon took one look at her naked breasts and immediately felt his cock rise up and pay attention. &quot;Oh, I am definitely up now,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Kim moved closer to Simon and said, &quot;So how about a little morning love before work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon grinned and said, &quot;I think we have enough time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim grinned back before moving over Simon, straddling his muscular body. With a soft moan, she impaled herself on his cock. Simon grunted as he moved his hands over her naked flesh, groping her breasts and ass. He let Kim build herself up more before he started thrusting into her. A small presence in the back of his head told him that he might not have many more times to fuck Kim before she became too young, so he need to make them count.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
In Simon&#39;s haste to exact vengeance on his parents, he had forgotten a few details and his dimmer awareness kept him from realizing that. While he told the Chronivac to make Kim his daughter, he hadn&#39;t specified about who his new wife would be. He also neglected to take Nichole into consideration. His former younger sister, the brat who seemed to do no wrong in their parents&#39; eyes, who their parents seemed to favor for no perceivable reason. Had his ire hadn&#39;t been so focused on his parents, Simon probably would have set up something for Nichole as well.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else, Nichole was oblivious to the changes that was happening to her family. She didn&#39;t notice her daddy getting younger or her brother getting older, their briefly becoming brothers, or the full swap. She did seem to notice that Daddy paid more attention to Johnny lately, mostly riding hard on him for something or other. But that wasn&#39;t Nichole&#39;s problem. She wasn&#39;t in trouble.<br />
<br />
Nichole had no idea what was hanging above her head. As Kim&#39;s years were removed, they collected in the Chronivac&#39;s cloud bank, which hung over the house like an invisible storm. The programming was looking for the right vessel to put all those years into. It kept overlooking Nichole as the recipient of those years would become Simon&#39;s new wife. And the programming didn&#39;t want the former siblings to become spouses until a better option was available.<br />
<br />
The process halted, leaving Kim a younger woman until another girl could be found. It stayed in standby until the afternoon. That was when Amy came over. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure why she had come over. She had the strangest feeling she was going to see her boyfriend. But Johnny was only 12 years old. And Simon was way too old for her, not to mention married. Her rational side came up with the idea that she was doing a babysitting job.<br />
<br />
Amy rang the doorbell and waited. When the door opened, it wasn&#39;t Johnny, but little Nichole waiting. &quot;Hi, Amy,&quot; said Nichole brightly, remembering her favorite babysitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nichole,&quot; said Amy, &quot;Have your parents left yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Nichole, &quot;They were about...about to...&quot; She trailed off as her mind went blank. Amy had a vacant look on her face too. Unknown to them, the Chronivac&#39;s programming was starting up again, getting ready to continue. In a few seconds, Kim&#39;s siphoned years will be earthing like a lightning bolt. But the question remains as who will be getting Kim&#39;s former role.</p>
