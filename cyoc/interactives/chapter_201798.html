<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now, you haven’t answered, Chaddy. Should I get one of your teammates for you? Or do you want to go around in that messy diaper? I mean, anyone in the corridor you walked through before had seen you wear it anyway, just not that you messed it.” Jenn asked him again after another minute.<br />
By now, Chad was so red in his embarrassment, a tomato would seem white next to him. He still tried to rip the diaper off, but couldn´t. But anyone seeing him like this? “No no no no no, don´t you dare getting anyone else here. I will find a way doing it myself.”<br />
Another round of laughter filled the fieldhouse. “I have effectively taken your hands from you, Chaddy. There is no way for you to remove that alone, and if there was, what´s next? You wouldn´t be able to put a new one onto your sorry ass. Or do you want to walk around really naked, showing of your little caged worm?”<br />
Chad realized something about his situation then. “Wait. If I have worn this diaper for a month, how is it still clean like this? And how could I have fitted any of my boxers over it, anyway?”<br />
Jenn´s grin was threatening her face to split in half. “Ah, I forgot you couldn´t realize it. Since you started wearing diapers last month, you have just seen them as your boxers. That being said, you simply pulled them down to do your business, like your old boxers. By the way, I took the liberty to let you bring me all your old, from now unused clothes, to burn them. No more lucky pants for you, baby Chaddy. “Remember””<br />
Chad felt a sudden influx of memories, of him clearing out his underwear drawer, filling it with diapers instead. But not only underwear. He had taken out his socks, had removed more than half of his shirts and shorts, and had also taken down any pictures of naked girls in his room. He had all of it thrown into a trash bag, then handed it to Jenn outside. He had seen her burn it all on a little campfire one by one.<br />
He also remembered this afternoon, walking down towards the fieldhouse, with everyone present gawking and laughing at his state in the former empty halls. He nearly fainted in shame. “Please, it´s enough. I´m sorry for what I did.” Chad nearly started crying.<br />
But Jenn didn´t accept it like that. “Ah, now you show remorse? What a pity that I have a few more bones to pick with you, my little Chaddy. You know, another reason why I´m mad at you is my cousin. He was such a nice person, until you nearly crippled him on the field about a month ago. While he is slowly getting better, at least physically, his character is now much more aggressive and mean. Maybe I can use these skills on him later, to make him how he was before, but you need to pay first. And the only way to make sure you never hurt my cousin like that again is for you to never be on the field again. “Weakling””<br />
Chad remembered a young player of another team they had played about a month ago, who he had tackled a bit too hard. But they never heard about him being nearly crippled. He cried out: “I´m sorry. We weren´t informed that he had problems afterwards.” But it was too late. He had already felt it the second Jenn had called him a weakling. His strength was leaving him, and he dropped in a heap on the floor. He didn´t know why he never moved to stop Jenn, but now he wouldn´t be able to. He couldn´t lift his own body anymore.<br />
“Your sorry is too late, my little Chaddy. Now you will never run the field again. You will be lucky if you could even crawl around more than a few meters. But don´t worry, I will take care of my little baby, or find someone who will do it for you. Now, to add another safety into never getting up again, baby. “Booties”” Jenn said, now wanting to get finished with him.<br />
The word didn´t trigger much. It was the same as “cage” and “diaper” had been, simply making him aware of what was covering his feet. Had he thought of them naked before, now he could see thin, slippery black socks on them, much like his mittens were slippery. He could even spot the dirt on them, as he had stepped into the dirt outside. But feeling them, he wondered how he had been able to walk over here without falling.<br />
Now he really felt like crying, something he would never have done before all this. He looked like a big baby to everyone. He would never life this down if Jenn let him go right now. <br />
As he was about to again plead with her for mercy, Jenn used the opportunity to take something from her bag, and just as Chad´s mouth opened, she shoved the object inside. “There, no more talking for little Chaddy, and no more kissing any girls yourself. Only sucking your nice big “Pacifier” for all to see.”<br />
Chad had tried spitting the pacifier out after a second of shock, but couldn´t. His mouth betrayed him, unable to spit, instead sucking vigorously on the thick bulb inside of it. How could this get any worse for him?<br />
He shouldn´t have thought that, as Jenn patted his head a bit. “Now, there isn´t much left to do. Locked in the right clothes with the needed protection, unable to do more than crawl. But let´s get your other end loose as well, Chaddy. After all, a real baby has not only no control over its bladder, but also his bowels, right? And you liked to spew shit enough anyway. Just from the wrong end, so let´s fix that. “Chocolate”.”<br />
At first, Chad had thought it was a gag of her, but he felt a sudden urge to push grow within him. And as he gave into that impulse, he could feel his diaper filling with his shit, flowing out as uncontrollable as his piss had before. Without a thought, a first few tears run out of his eyes. His pride was nearly non-existent now.<br />
“Ohh, is my little Chaddy crying? Is it my fault? I guess it´s more the feeling of stewing in your own shit. But that´s not really what I want to see. A few, ashamed tears? Let´s try again, “Cry” for me, Chaddy.” Jenn gloated grinning. It wasn´t much left for Chad.<br />
Chad, hearing her, tried stopping his tears. It was already embarrassing enough, he would satisfy her and shed more tears. But again, his body betrayed him. Without any control, the flow of tears increased drastically, and even with the pacifier firmly inside his mouth he released first quiet sobs, before it really become a full out bawling. <br />
Jenn grinned as Chad acted more like a baby with each blockade, she opened inside of him. Easily knowing how to act, she stepped towards Chad, and opened his diaper. She removed it, took out all the things she needed from the bag she dropped by the door, and worked on the bawling Chad. <br />
Not even half a minute later, Chad laid there, in a clean diaper, slowly decreasing his tears. “There, there, it´s okay, Chaddy. All nice and clean again. And not much left to finish your punishment.” Jenn cooed at him, as if he really was only a little baby to her.</p>
