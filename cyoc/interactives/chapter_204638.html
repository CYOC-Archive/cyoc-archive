<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Caleb was feeling extra horny. He just couldn&#39;t shake the memory of what happened today with Beau. It was something that was entirely foreign to him, and yet he had never felt better because of it. <br />
<br />
It was odd. He wasn&#39;t gay or anything like that, and yet... he only could feel a little excited when he remembered Beau&#39;s cock inside of his mouth, his musk filling his nose, the feeling of swallowing that man&#39;s load... all of it was only bringing up good feelings. No disgust or regret whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And speaking of Beau, Caleb wondered why he feels like some invisible connection between them has been formed? It wasn&#39;t like they knew each other that well. But the thought of seeing him again made Caleb pretty happy, and strangly horny too. <br />
<br />
With nothing else to do, Caleb began masturbating. He was too horny to go to sleep early, or do anything else to pass the time. He pulled out his phone and began browsing through some porn, but unlike usual, nothing really seemed to be doing it for him. Sure the girls were hot and all, but it just didn&#39;t seem to mesh with his desires at the moment. His dick wasn&#39;t even fully erect, despite his constant pumping of it and his highly aroused state.<br />
<br />
As porn wasn&#39;t working, Caleb&#39;s mind began to wander. Somehow, he wound up thinking back to when Beau was fingering his taint. Having no reason not to, Caleb shifted his hand&#39;s focus away from stroking his limp, semi hard shaft, to pressing his thumb against the spot just behind his balls that Beau was pressing earlier. Immediately he felt an explosion of pleasure, and his dick began to drool a clear, drippy fluid. The more he pressed and rubbed that spot, the more of this insane level of pleasure coursed through his body.<br />
<br />
Yes, through his entire body. Not only his cock and balls, but his arms, legs, stomach and chest all felt the tingle of pleasure. It was like his entire body had become a little more sensitive to the touch, and his nipples were hard as rocks once again. Caleb could only chuckle when he realized that they were harder than his dick. <br />
<br />
With his free hand, Caleb started alternating between the two of them. Teasing, poking, pinching, etc... whatever he could think of doing, his hand did to his nipples, and it all felt really good. Every touch would send bolts of pleasure from his nipple to the outermost extremities of his entire body, causing his back to begin to arch off of the bed and his toes to curl almost violently. <br />
<br />
Things continued on like this for quite a whike longer, until Caleb hit a wall he just couldn&#39;t seem to pass. Even rubbing the tip of his dick was only bringing him right to the tipping point, but not over. He was still missing something. Something important that he had earlier today. But what was it?<br />
<br />
He comtinued to edge himself for half a minute before he found the answer. He was missing the most important piece. He was missing Beau. Just picturing that man in his head was enough to cause that inner build up to move forwards again. He had passed that wall and was soon sent into a thrashing fit as he came. It was far more pleasurable than it had been during class, and by far the best orgasm he ever had in his life. But that wasn&#39;t all, no sooner had he finished sperting out his far more viscose than usual cum, but he felt another orgasm already start building up. <br />
<br />
He had never orgasmed twice in rapid succession before. But there was no stopping this. Caleb continued to pour his thoughts into only thoughts of Beau, and in turn, his body rewarded him with another intense orgasm +1. He thought of how Beau&#39;s beard felt between his legs, and came a third time. How good his mouth felt for a fourth. Beau&#39;s smell and gentleness earned him his fifth, and so on.<br />
<br />
He finally became too tired for more after his seventh orgasm, with his dick having long since run dry after his fourth. Never had he ever felt so satisfied and yet, completely unsatisfied from masturbating before. It was difficukt, feeling both polar opposites, but that was the case. He had enjoyed himself, but it wasn&#39;t enough. He knew what he was missing, and as much as it bothered him to accept it, he had to admit that he had somehow developed an interest in another man. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t exactly love, but he definitely had an attraction towards him. Maybe it was just a result of what he and Beau did earlier in the day? And Caleb wondered how it would be moving forwards now. Would he be able to look at Beau the same way, now that he had masturbated to just thoughts about him and his body? Or was this why Beau had told him not to worry earlier, and that he belonged in the class? Did others know something about him which he himself didn&#39;t, like a hidden or repressed gayness? Could this possibly be why his porn viewing was so uninteresting earlier, because he was actually attracted to men?</p>
