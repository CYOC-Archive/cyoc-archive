<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bruno collapsed atop the springy mattress, both men’s sweat mingling together as Bruno lay his cheek against Chad’s flattened face. Both panted in the relative quiet of Bruno’s room, minutes passing as the suns rays played over their bodies, the shadow of blind slats slowly moving further and further as evening took a hold. <br />
<br />
Finally, Chad decided to speak up. <br />
<br />
“So now what?” He asked quietly. His only response was a snore, and the feeling of drool pooling against his skin. It began to run closer to his mouth, so Chad closed it along with his eyes, deciding to sleep as well. <br />
<br />
The next morning he woke alone. His eyes darted around, unable to see much of the room due to being fixed to a flat plane. The smell of bacon and eggs wafted through the air as he heard a shower running a room over.  About ten minutes or so later, Bruno appeared standing over Chad, hair wet and a plate of breakfast in hand. <br />
<br />
Chad opened his mouth to speak, only for Bruno to turn around and plop, unceremoniously, upon Chad’s face. <br />
<br />
“Hhhy, wuh giss?” <br />
<br />
“Gimme a minute man I’m beat.” Bruno shifted, his muscular ass digging an indent over half of Chad’s mouth and right eye. He seemed to take his sweet time eating, until he set the plate down on an end table and then laid down over Chad’s entire face. The mattress snorted like a horse, but Bruno didn’t stir. <br />
<br />
“Okay. It’s Saturday. I got work in a bit, so you’re just gonna stay here. But uh, well. I got morning wood.” Bruno sat up, scooting down so that Chad’s face was unobscured. He looked down to the mattress with a smirk. “And considering how good last night was, I was wondering if you’d want to help take care of it?”<br />
<br />
Given the fact that he was just sat upon, Chad wanted to say ‘fuck no’. But the same drug that had turned him into a human mattress seemed to make Chad insatiably horny. Besides— he still felt that he owed Bruno. Maybe he was still an object, a human fuck toy of sorts, but he wasn’t some fleshlight being rented out to entire football teams. That was something. And if Bruno treated him anything like he did last night, well, Chad would welcome that. Being treated as a person, at the very least. <br />
<br />
“Okay.” Was all he said. He hoped the favor would be returned.<br />
<br />
Bruno didn’t have to be told twice. He dove right into frenching Chad. His strong hands worked up and down his sides, and his erection pressed against his front. Chad couldn’t help but imagine being one of Bruno’s many conquests: some skinny little brunette in a short skirt moaning like a whore as the jock worked her over. <br />
<br />
Bruno pulled back and began to shift around until his huge, pulsing cock was positioned right over Chad’s mouth. The mattress looked at it with trepidation, keeping his elongated mouth sealed until he felt a pair of lips kissing at his own tip. <br />
<br />
Chad gasped, his own lips peeling open so that Bruno’s cockhead could press in between. Instinct took over and he began to suckle, closing his eyes to savor the salty, musky taste. His ministrations urged Bruno to go full hilt, hurrying his entire dick until he felt Chad’s nostrils flaring beneath his balls. <br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck yeah!” Bruno plunged down hard enough to make Chad gag, and then shoved his mouth over Chad’s budding erection. In no time it was at a full 11 inches, making Bruno gag as well. Both men moaned in tandem as they felt each others hot, wet throats struggling to milk the massive meat. <br />
<br />
Before long, Bruno came buckets. Chad as well, but little did he know that each time he came only added to the contents of his mattress tummy. By the time both men were empty, Chad was sporting a healthy amount of padding around his middle. Bruno flipped over and flopped atop it, feeling the wobble as his feet lay over Chad’s eyes. <br />
<br />
“Man. Those jocks got you trained.”<br />
<br />
He sat up and looked down at Chad’s plush stomach, giving it a pat and smiling as it rippled like a water bed. <br />
<br />
“That’s a nice feature.”<br />
<br />
Chad was tired from feeling full, and his throat hurt. He shut his eyes as Bruno got dressed and left for work, quickly falling asleep until the sound of a door closing woke him up with a start. He groaned, his skin smarted. Laying in the sun from the window had given him a bit of a burn over his middle. <br />
<br />
Bruno was home, and before Chad could greet him the man was already on top of him licking around his mouth. Chad was unable to resist and began kissing back, and before he knew it, he was taking Bruno up his ass.<br />
<br />
The next seven days played out like this— the only difference being the occasional ‘quality time’ where Bruno lay and read on Chad, or play video games. Sometiems they would chat, but mostly they would fuck. Bruno was considerate enough to slather sun screen on Chad and close the blinds during the day, or leave the tv or radio on for him. <br />
<br />
Over the course of a week, Chad had become chubby— his sides dimpling over the bed frame, his eyes squinting from the way his cheeks grew, his abs and every over muscular contour completely obscured by a layer of cum bubbling below his skin. He felt a bit like a hybrid water bed, but instead of water, it was his own and Bruno’s spunk filling him. <br />
<br />
Even his voice had taken a thick, gurgling kind of quality. And while he was unable to see the change, his dick had shortened into a fat little chode, as if the weight of viscous liquid within him caused the member to succumb to the law of gravity and spread. It was like the cum wanted to pool, but Chad was the bladder keeping it in place. If Bruno plopped down on him too hard, he would cough some up. He wasn’t sure how the man planned to empty him, or how it would affect his transformation back into a human, or if f he would get so full of cum that he risk popping.</p>
