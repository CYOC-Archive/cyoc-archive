<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oh fuck, yesterday I thought things cannot be worse… But I was wrong. I think things accelerated up today. First of all, I had a wet dream. It should not be a problem, if I would have dream about having sex with a girl. But in my dream I’ve kissed with Brandon, and I rubbed his hairy chest and arms… Why does it happening to me? I had to clean myself again, and I went to the bathroom, where I saw that my body hair increased again. My armhair is thicker, and stronger. It does not laying against the skin anymore. Okay, it is still not really noticeable, but my legs… curly blond hairs are covering them. It is also normal for a guy, but it’s now obviously hairy. My chest hair also increased. The hair between my pecs connected to the hairs around my nipples. And my facial hair is between stubble and beard. I shaved myself again, although I knew it will grow out in several hours. In the morning I went to the gym with Josh. I realized that I was a lot stronger than a week ago. During the week, I almost doubled the weights I could lift. Now I am able to lift 70 kgs. By the way, I was horny all the time. Josh didn’t shaved today, so he had a stubble that didn’t help. All the time I wanted to rub his face, arms, legs or chest, depending on what was visible. One time he asked me to hold his legs on the ground while he was doing sit-ups. As I touched his hairy ankles, I became hard, and it was difficult to hide it. I couldn’t wait to finish workout, to rush home and jack off…<br />
Today was the first meeting with Mike, to check my Results, and to get the protein powder for the next week. All afternoon I was thinking about him. Last time I found him disgusting, but now the idea to see the hairiest guy I’ve ever met made me really excited. The closer the time came, the more horny I became, and the more horny I became, the more I was thinking about him. Finally it was afternoon, and I went to the lab where Mike worked. When his secretary let me in to his office, he was on a phone, and he pointed to the seat in front of his desk. While he was on the phone, I could examine him. He was a lot hairier than I expected. Last time I could only see his hands and a hint of his hairy torso, as he was wearing a suit and his shirt was buttoned up all the way. Now he was wearing a shirt only, and it’s sleeves were rolled up, so I could see his forearms. Or more precisely, I couldn’t, as a thick coat of hair… no fur covered them. I’m becoming horny as I think of his arms again. The top of his shirt was also open, so I could see the same fur poking out as well. After he finished the phone call, he made some small talk with me, and then he asked about my experience with the powder. I told him about how stronger I became, and that my weight increased. He told me that we will check it soon, and we were going to make some physical examinations. Then he asked me about any side effects, so I mentioned the increased body hair, and the horniness. He told me, that both might be increased a bit, but none of them as much as my symptoms. He asked me to show him my “so called”armhair, so I rolled up my left sleeve. He slowly rubbed my hairy arms, then pulled some hairs into the air, and told that it is “normal for my age”, and that I was just not taking care about it before. He then rubbed his own hairy arms to show me what can be called as real hair. The problem with that was that I was already turned on, but as he rubbed the hair, with a cocky smile on his face, I couldn’t resist, and shot my load into my trousers. I was ashamed. I knew I have to put an end to this, so I asked what kind of side effects could this powder cause. I mentioned a lot that I had just found out (body fat increase, getting dumber, getting smarter, health issues and changing sexual orientation). I didn’t want to tell directly, that I’m turning into gay, so I hide it between a lot of other possible symptoms. He told me that none of them might be possible. Thank God, my gay thoughts were not caused by the protein. He asked me to go to the other room to examine my body. I needed to remove all my clothes, except my trunks. I was wearing a black one, so he couldn’t see it was wet. He measured my weight (I was 10kgs heavier than a week ago), then my height (to my surprise, I grew 2cms),then my heart rate and blood pressure. Then I sat up to a table, and he checked my muscle definition by his hands. He touched all my body parts, and rubbed my chest and arm hair. I became erected and I’m sure he realized it. I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At a point I was sure he is testing how far he can go before I stop him. But I didn’t want to stop. I wanted to touch those hairy arms. At a point he went behind the table, and he checked my back muscles. He then slowly moved his hands to my sides, than slowly he moved them towards my chest under my arms, and he started to rub my trimmed chest hair. I finally touched his furry arms. It was strong, but soft, like an animal. I rubbed them, but I told him in a weak voice that I need to go home to my girlfriend. He said he examined everything. I put my clothes on, and he handed me the protein for the next week. He also gave me a paper with his own mobile phone in case if I have questions. I rushed home. I was broken. And ashamed. I almost had sex with a disgusting hairy man…</p>
