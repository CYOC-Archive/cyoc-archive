<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up bright and early in the morning, sun streaming in though your window. Tired as you were after all the excitement you had yesterday, you forgot to close the curtains, but it feels so good to just lay in bed and relax that you don't bother getting up to close them. Instead you roll over to your other side, feeling the heavy weight of your ample breasts shift as you do so. Smiling sleepily, you bring your hands up to your chest, recalling the way Stacy had played with them, licking them all over and sucking on your nipples. Rolling your nipples between your fingers, pinching and gently pulling, you think about her promise that the two of you will be having more fun today. At that thought a warm feeling washes over you, coming to rest in the pit of your stomach. It's enough to send a tingle through your cock, and letting go of one of your breasts, you reach down to rub it between your thumb and first finger. The stimulation isn't enough to get it hard though, and you try pressing the heel of your hand against it the way Stacy did.<br />
<br />
Thinking of your girlfriend causes the warmth to intensify, but does little to get you hard. In the end you give up and get out of bed.<br />
<br />
By the sounds of it, no one else is up yet, so you don't bother to get dressed before heading to the bathroom. Your double-d cup breasts bounce as you walk, the cool morning air making your nipples perk up.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom you look at yourself in the mirror, admiring how round and full your breasts are despite their great size, your thin, androgynous body only serving to make them appear larger. Then your gaze moves down to your cock and balls, small enough to be almost hidden by the neat triangle of your downy pubic hair.<br />
<br />
With a small smile you sit down on the toilet and relieve yourself, since as small as your cock is, standing to pee isn't an option. Once you finish, you take a square of toilet paper and blot yourself dry, then you wash your hands and head back to your room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
First things first, you look through your dresser until you find one of your bras, a sturdy affair of plain white cotton, padded with cups that provide plenty of support for your breasts. Fastening the strap behind your back, you then run your fingers along the front of the elastic to get it perfectly into place and let out a sigh of relief. As large as your breasts are, it's uncomfortable to walk around for too long without proper support. Then you slip on a pair of boxers and a baggy pair of blue jeans. Since you're not going anywhere special you figure that you don't need to dress too nicely so rather than wear one of your nicer blouses, you just put on a regular dark blue t-shirt.<br />
<br />
It isn't until you reach into your sock drawer and feel see the magical flashlight that it all fully sinks in. Until yesterday you were an ordinary guy. Then you found that strange little store in the mall and bought the flashlight. A few quick tests on your best friend showed that it was a magical flashlight with the ability to alter people's sexual characteristics as well as reality to make everyone except you think that the changes were normal. You first used it to take away nearly all of your masculine characteristics, then let your girlfriend and some of her friends dress you up as a girl, before giving yourself breasts on a whim.<br />
<br />
Now that you're thinking about it, you realize how strange it all is, especially since all of your memories are unchanged,even though everyone else seemed to think that the changes you had made had always been there. It's enough to make you want to change back to normal right now, but you're too curious about what Stacy has planned for you, especially since the changes in reality have made her far less passive about sex than she used to be. In fact, you'd go so far as to say that she's become the more dominant one in your relationship, something that excites you. If given the chance, you'd like to keep things that way once you change back to normal, just because it's interesting to have a girlfriend be so assertive about sex.<br />
<br />
Placing the light in your pocket, you head to the kitchen to see about having some breakfast.<br />
<br />
Just as you're sitting down to have a some cereal your mother walks in. She sees you and smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was the pool party last night? Were there any other guys there or was it just you and the girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just me and the girls,&quot; you laugh, reaching into your pocket. Since you have the light with you, you decide that you might as well have some fun. You recall that yesterday your mother went to the beauty parlor, which gives you an idea. Putting the light on to its highest blue setting you wait for your mother to turn around, then you shine it on the back of her head. Instantly her hair shrinks back into her scalp, shortening until it's a crew cut, &quot;By the way, I really like your new haircut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; your mother runs a hand through her short hair, &quot;It just got to be such a hassle keeping it long and I think it looks so much better this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you think it's a little butch though?&quot; you ask, trying hard not to burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little,&quot; your mother shrugs, &quot;But I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You decide that as long as you keep the changes slight you might as well have some more fun. You already know that on the lower settings the light is so faint that no one can see it, so that's what you do next, put the light at a blue setting just above the absolute lowest. As soon as your mother looks away from you, you sweep the light over her stomach, being careful not to go to low and make her a man, then up to her chest, making sure to get her arms. Her pink nightgown changes, becoming a plain white t-shirt a pair of pink pajama pants. The t-shirt is obviously a man's t-shirt, and her arms, though still slender have become nicely toned and more than a little hairy. Also noticeable is that she's become completely flat chested and that her shoulders are wider. When she sits down across from you, you realize that you must have gotten her neck and face as well, because you can see the slight bump of an Adam's-apple at her throat and one look at her face makes you realize that there's a light dusting of peach-fuzz on her chin and upper lip. You can still recognize her features, though they are fairly masculinized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; you say with a smile, &quot;Your new haircut really suits you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so too,&quot; she says, her voice far deeper than it was before, not at all feminine, but not quite that of an adult man.<br />
<br />
Before you can say anything further, your little brother, Luke, runs into the kitchen and jumps onto your mother's lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want pancakes mommy!&quot; he laughs and gives her a hug.<br />
<br />
She hugs him back, picking him up as she stands up, something which you haven't seen her do in years, &quot;Alright honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke laughs even harder when she gives him a kiss on the cheek. Squirming, and pretending to try and get away, he wipes at the side of his face, &quot;You're all whiskery mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later your father enters the kitchen as well and you get up and excuse yourself.<br />
<br />
You make a quick phone call to Stacy, who informs you that her parents should be gone within half an hour and that they'll be gone all day.<br />
<br />
Excited, you quickly brush your teeth and head over to her house, knowing that by the time you get there it'll be just you and her.<br />
<br />
When you arrive she greets you with a hug and kiss and not just any kiss either. She takes you on forcefully, her tongue pushing its way into your mouth even as her hands reach down to press you against her. By the time she breaks the kiss you're gasping for breath and the warm feeling has started in your stomach again.<br />
<br />
Guided by her, you stagger into her house and into her room, where the curtains are already drawn and the lights are dimmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be good,&quot; she smiles, pulling you over to her bed and then falling down on top of you, straddling your hips. Grinding against you, she helps you take off your shirt and bra, bending down to plant a kiss on each of your big, firm nipples as soon as they're exposed.<br />
<br />
You can feel them perk up and harden under the attentions of her tongue, which causes you to let out a low moan.<br />
<br />
Laughing wickedly, she leaves your breasts just long enough to pull off her shirt and bra, then presses down on top of you, her breasts meeting yours as she kisses you again, one of her hands sliding down to press against your cock and rub you through the fabric of your jeans.<br />
<br />
You start bucking against her hand, which starts her laughing so hard that she has to stop kissing you, &quot;Take it easy. We need to finish getting undressed and then I have a big surprise for you. I'm sure we can get you to orgasm this time, you just need the proper stimulation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever she means by that, you don't care. As soon as she lets you get up, you pull off your pants and boxers, taking great care to make sure that she doesn't see you put the flashlight on her night table, where you can easily reach it once things get underway.<br />
<br />
Stacy undresses as well, but instead of getting back into bed with you she goes over to her closet and begins looking for something, &quot;Close your eyes and don't open them until I tell you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious, but excited, you do as told, and soon enough you hear her walk back toward the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you can open your eyes now!&quot;<br />
<br />
You do and the sight that greets you takes your breath away. Your girlfriend is standing at the foot of the bed, naked except for a flesh colored strap-on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you stare in horror at the smooth, hard piece of plastic at Stacy's crotch, but despite your horror, you're intrigued. What would it feel like to be penetrated by a girl instead of the other way around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roll over,&quot; she says urgently, &quot;Then we can get started for real!&quot;<br />
<br />
You take several deep breaths, trying to figure out what to do. There's no getting out of this, and you're not sure that you want to, but the strap-on looks so big...<br />
<br />
That gives you an idea, you just have to hope that it works.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, let me help get you ready,&quot; you lick your lips, hoping that she gets the idea, &quot;Close your eyes and I'll sock your cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
A slow smile comes across Stacy's face, &quot;Wow, I never thought of it like that. That's so awesome! It'll be like you're the girl and I'm the guy instead of the other way around!&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she closes her eyes, you reach for the flashlight and make a split second decision. The warmth in your stomach has only continued to grow, and this is your one chance since after this you're going to change yourself back to normal so you never have to go through this again. Besides, if you change things too much right now, you might miss out on the change to have sex, and at the moment the only thing that you're sure of is that you want to have sex more than you've ever wanted it before in your life.<br />
<br />
The flashlight is at the same low blue setting you used on your mother earlier, hopefully it's enough to do what you want without being too much. Crossing your fingers you shine the light at Stacy's crotch and let out a sigh of relief. The huge strap-on is gone, replaced by a much less intimidating, circumcised, cock, half hard and not much larger than three inches. You guess that fully hard Stacy will be a small four inches, which isn't bad at all when you think about it.<br />
<br />
Putting the flashlight back on the night table, you gingerly run your tongue along the underside of your girlfriend's cock, going from base to head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss me like you did yesterday!&quot; Stacy hisses through clenched teeth, and you comply, gently taking her cock in one hand and kissing the head. A bead of pre-cum wets your lips and you lick it away, letting your tongue flick across her cock slit.<br />
<br />
Never before in your life did you imagine that you'd end up in a situation like this, about to suck a cock, but now that you're in it it doesn't seem so bad. After all, it is your girlfriend's cock that you'll be sucking.<br />
<br />
You have no problem taking her entire length, which can't be more than four inches, if that, into your mouth, sucking gently as she thrusts, her balls hitting your chin as she does so. Sliding and licking in time with her thrusts, you tease her with your tongue until she pulls away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'm ready, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding nervously, you roll over and present your ass to her.<br />
<br />
There's a quick bit of fumbling, her fingers parting your ass cheeks, then her cock head bumping against your asshole, once, twice, three times, then thrusting into you.<br />
<br />
A moment of pain makes you tense ans she slides in, but as small as her cock is, it's over quickly enough and completely forgotten when she reaches that spot inside you where the warmth in your stomach seems to be emanating from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you moan, &quot;Right there!&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulls back and plunges in as deep as she can, hitting the spot again, making the warmth increase and causing your inner muscles to clamp down around her cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harder! Harder!&quot; you pant, your breasts shaking as she roughly thrusts into you, then her breasts press against your back as she bends and reaches to push a hand against your cock. You rub against her as hard as you can, smashing your little cock against her fingers in a way that should have been painful, but instead causes you the most intense pleasure you've ever felt.<br />
<br />
Between the stimulation you're receiving, both internal and external, you're the first to cum. you tense, feel a twitch from your cock, then a bit of moisture so small it might just be sweat. Despite having orgasmed, the warmth inside you remains, growing even stronger as Stacy continues to thrust into you.<br />
<br />
You clench down hard around her with all your might when she hits the spot where the warmth within you originates, trying to hold her there and causing her to cry out. A few more thrusts each one causing you to clench your muscles harder before, and then it happens. <br />
<br />
You feel Stacy grow still, a tremor running through her as she reaches the deepest part of of her thrust, and you push back against her. Then she cums, you can actually feel the spurt, hot strong, reaching the heat within you.<br />
<br />
As her softening cock slides free, the heat begins to fade, replaced by a deep feeling of contentment.<br />
<br />
Still a girl in every other way, Stacy cuddles against you, her breasts warm against your back, as she reaches around to cup your breasts in her hands, &quot;That was amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
She whispers softly in your ear, then kisses your neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; you sigh, amazed at just how good it felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the world's best boyfriend,&quot; she says, kissing you again as you fall asleep in each other's arms.</p>
