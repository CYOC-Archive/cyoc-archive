<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day seems to be &#39;one of those&#39; for you.<br />
<br />
The light bulb in your room dies and when you open the blinds to let the sun in for light it proves to bright for your eyes causing you to fall backwards out of bed. You don&#39;t see the water on the bathroom floor until its too late sending you slipping forward into the shower curtains pulling them and the rod down on top of you. The toaster gets jammed burning part of your breakfast and forcing you to waste time turning off the fire alarms.<br />
<br />
This trends of events persists through the morning for you. So that when you head to the bus stop to go to college you see your usual ride fly by as the stop is empty. The one that is supposed to follow doesn&#39;t until you board a different bus that will still get you to campus but requires you to transfer to another bus along the way. You sigh as you look out the window and see the one you had been waiting for pass by.<br />
<br />
Stepping out at the bus stop, also empty, and wait for the bus that should just get you to college with some time to spare before your first class. And wait. And wait. You check your phone to confirm the bus is now almost ten minutes late then look up at the sky wanting to yell in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay! Hey is that you?&quot; calls out a female voice from you left.<br />
<br />
It sounds familiar to you so that when you turn the person&#39;s name is on your lips. &quot;Vikki.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ex-girlfriend and current friend of Zoe she pulls up in front of the bus stop in a green car. She smiles brightly as she leans into the passenger seat to see you better. &quot;Still taking the bus everywhere Jay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You note it not the same one from when you dated, making you wonder how she had the money for that one or to get this one. &quot;Yeah, its what we poor college student have to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to get whiny,&quot; she gives a quick annoyed look you remember well before her smile returns. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be there already preppy boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would except the bus are being crap today.&quot; you tell her flatly. &quot;Haven&#39;t been able to catch a single one I need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor you,&quot; she say back, pouting sadly and tracing tears going down her face for a moment. &quot;Well then how about I give you a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately you feel anxious at her offer. Getting a ride from an ex you haven&#39;t spoken to in quite some time makes you feel, well, weird. And while your relationship was a rocky one you certainly didn&#39;t end it with bitter note. Plus it does not appear the bus you want is going to show up anytime soon. &quot;Sure, and thanks.&quot; you say as you open the car door and get in.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, you know I do like to help people.&quot; says Vikki as she pulls away from the curb.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you want to.&quot; you reply back with a smirk remembering this from when you dated.<br />
<br />
&quot;True.&quot; she grins. Then the car is quiet as she turns her attention to the road and you check your phone internally breathing in relief as you see you still have time before class starts.<br />
<br />
Once you do that though the anxiousness returns as you are not sure what to do. Looking out the window is boring as the sidewalks are mostly empty while the streets still packed from morning traffic. Eventually your gaze finds its way to Vikki, though not wanting to be rude you only glance out of the corner of your eye.<br />
<br />
You note she hasn&#39;t changed too much since you last saw her. She still wears her black hair short with the tips colored though they are now orange instead purple. Her choice in clothing is similar too, as she has changed from ripped sleeve shirts to a tank top while still wearing jeans with rips down the front.<br />
<br />
She has more piercings as well as the one left eyebrow stud has been joined by ring on her right eyebrow, and a ring on the right side of her nose. You even see the top of a flower tattoo poking over the top of her pants on her hip. You find your glance lingering though as you notice Vikki has put on some weight.<br />
<br />
Sure she is still has the slender but muscular dancer build she had back in high school but now there was a definite softness about her. Her thighs were plumper, enough that skin poked through holes the holes in her pants. A soft stomach poked over the waist of her jeans and pushed up the bottom of her tank top. And her arms and face had just a hint of plushness.<br />
<br />
All of which has a small part of you admitting does look good on her. You shake you head and look out the window to clear the small bit of attraction away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Learn to drive shithead!&quot; Vikki sudden swearing at another driver and honking the horn helps too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn other asshole drivers,&quot; she mutters before reaching over and opening the glove box. You watch as she pulls out a thick joint wrapped in newspaper then at the next red light she lights it up and takes a long draw.<br />
<br />
You are about to comment when Vikki exhales and the smoke makes you cough. As you do that same earthy yet oddly sweaty smell from yesterday evening enters your nose along with the smoke albeit much weaker. You don&#39;t know why you remember this smell but you know you and your classmates smelled it before blacking out and waking up in the garden at night.<br />
<br />
As you thinking this you fail to notice as Vikki&#39;s belly pushes outward to fully hang over the front of her jeans. The holes in her pants widen as her hips and legs pudged out. A layer of fat added to her face giving it a cherubic look as her nose began to push up into a snout and the tops of her ears became pointed. Her ass expanded into a rounded jiggly mass revealing more of her flower hip tattoo and that she was wearing a thong as her butt flesh pulled down the waist of her pants. The neck of her tank top was also pulled down as her breasts swelled to give her some nice cleavage. While a curly tail emerges from an already formed hole in the back of her jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah that&#39;s good.&quot; says Vikki as she takes another draw and snorts as she exhales.<br />
<br />
Leaning towards the window for fresh air you also don&#39;t perceive as your own stomach grows a bit. Your nose and ears grow slightly as your arms and legs gain some softness too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vikki, what, is, that, stuff?&quot; you ask between coughs. You look over at her but aren&#39;t able to see her clearly as the smoke makes your eyes water. What you can see though looks quite good as that small part of your brain that seems to have grown makes your eyes linger on her more apparent curves. You shift in your seat feeling warm and a tightness in your crotch, both from arousal and gained weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, this?&quot; she asks back holding the joint up after her third draw with a wicked smirk on her face. &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that,&quot; as you try to keep your eyes off the bouncing of her chest and ass as the car hits a bump. &quot;I smelled something, like it yesterday. I just want to, know what, it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Vikki considered the joint and gave a small snort as she stopped at a red light. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what it is, if you take a hit first.&quot; Then offers it to you as her eyes go to the tenting in your pants.</p>
