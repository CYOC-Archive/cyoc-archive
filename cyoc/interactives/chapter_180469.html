<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your next objective would be to find a hiding place. The bunny mannequins seemed to be a part of the mansion guesthouse, so it&#39;s reasonable to assume they might know a way to enter into the mansion proper. And if you had to be somewhere in the mansion, you&#39;d prefer to be on the upper levels so that you potentially had a higher vantage point to see them sooner. Plus, if you explored the ground floor for somewhere to hide, they could enter somewhere nearby to you, or maybe see you walking through a window.<br />
<br />
You minced over to the stairwell in the conjoining room. You were paying very close attention to any sounds that could mean that someone else was nearby. From what you could see, the mansion seemed to be clean and in order, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any residents here. You didn&#39;t want to call out, as you were technically an intruder and didn&#39;t belong here. <br />
Unfortunately, your attentiveness to hearing meant that you weren&#39;t as focused upon the stairs in front of you, and you found your foot hit a stair harshly as you didn&#39;t lift it high enough, which led to you quickly stepping forward to catch yourself, sending your foot sliding on a rug on the stairs. You barely caught yourself by hanging onto the banister to prevent yourself from falling down.<br />
This latex catusit you&#39;re wearing seemed to dull your senses a bit, and the way it hugged your hips and chest meant that your walking pattern was slightly altered from what you were used to. <br />
<br />
Reaching the top of the stairs, you were met with a junction that led off to the left and right. Since you had entered from the very leftmost wall of the mansion, you decided to go right, leading you more towards the center and away from where you entered. There were a couple of doors that lined the hallway of brown, wooden walls and decorations that bore a lot of gold, but you decided to go further on before you start poking around, wanting to put some more distance between you.<br />
<br />
The mansion&#39;s halls seemed a tad longer than you would have imagined them to be, which gave you some time to think about the situation you had landed yourself in. The bunny mannequins definitely freaked you out, and given the vehement nature with which they chased you with, you weren&#39;t all that eager to allow yourself get too close to them. You weren&#39;t too sure how the latex catsuit fit into their plans, or maybe it&#39;s possible that the wardrobe you got stuck in was something separate from them. While certainly the thought of wearing the latex catsuit when you first were forcibly put in it wasn&#39;t all that appealing, what with how it seemed a bit exposing even though it was covering all your skin, or even how it now gave you a few extra parts to deal with, but you found that you didn&#39;t mind it as much. In fact, you found the gentle squeezing from it to be even comforting. The way it pulled on your legs as you treaded down the corridor or the little squeaking noises it made when it came into contact with itself. It was..... pleasant. Odd, but pleasant. <br />
<br />
You still wanted to get out of it at some point, but as you couldn&#39;t seem to do it on your own right now, you paid it little thought and instead started wracking your brain on what could be a good hiding place. You didn&#39;t expect the bunny mannequins to leave you alone, so it was best that you use this time you have to secure as much of an advantage you can.<br />
<br />
You eventually came to a stop where a hallway branched out to your left. You didn&#39;t think you had reached the middle of the mansion yet, and even looking down the hallway, you could see the warm glow of lights as the hallway let out into what seemed to be a large room. But maybe it was because you decided that you had walked for too long, or maybe it was instinct, but you decided to branch off and begin looking into the rooms that were in this hallway.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t terribly large, maybe thirty feet across, but it was wide enough to feature little tables lined up against the walls, topped with picture frames or little knick-knacks for decoration. You could see four doors, one on the left side of the hallway and three against the right, as well as this hallway seemingly wrapping around to the left at the end. The bend there seemed to open up a bit and a couch was placed to the side.<br />
<br />
Grasping the first door to your right, you gently creaked the door open to find what seemed to be a small study. Two armchairs were placed at the back, with a small table in front of them and a bookshelf against the wall between them. A desk with a lamp on top of it was placed on the right wall and a tall plant sat squatly beside the desk. On the left wall, a door that led onwards to the next room in the hall was inlaid and a curious pedestal was placed to the side of the door. It had a note attached to it that listed some numbers alongside some words, like &#39;servants&#39; or &#39;kitchen.&#39; Seeing a number-pad on the top, you guessed it was some sort of communication system for contacting other areas of the mansion. You decided that you would leave that alone for now.<br />
<br />
Deciding that there wasn&#39;t really any good places to hide here, save for ducking behind the chairs in the back, you pulled open the next door. Stepping in, you found yourself in a large library. There were two doors to your left, which must be the two doors out into the hallway. Rows upon rows of bookshelves stood proudly, and there seemed to be a second level above you as well. More chairs and couches were found in thee middle of the room, and there was a ladder on wheels that was placed off to the side, presumably for helping to reach some of the higher bookshelves. While hiding behind bookshelves, or perhaps under a couch here could prove more profitable than the study, it still didn&#39;t quite provide what you were looking for, so you exited back into the hallway and went to the solo door on the left wall.<br />
<br />
Curiously, as you approached this door, you noticed that the lock that all the doors had was engaged here. The doors seemed to lock and unlock from the outside, so turned the knob and opened the door. Looking upon the opposite side of the door, you didn&#39;t see a way in which to disengage the lock. Whoever was in this room could be locked in from the outside. That thought alone was chilling, but what greeted you inside left you a bit more disturbed.<br />
<br />
Mirrors. The ceiling, the walls, the floor; It was all mirrors. Aside from this narrow entryway you stood in, which seemed to be made black to reinforce the presence of the mirrors, you could see reflections of yourself, a black figure against the doorway, duplicated across many surfaces. And in the middle of it all, there was a curious wooden board. There were metal clamps on the sides, and there were a series of holes that went across the face of it: two small ones on the top and bottom, and one larger one in the middle. A pair of chains were attached to the top, and they seemed to reach up to the ceiling, holding the plank upright and keeping it from falling over. <br />
<br />
The sight of this made you feel uneasy, although you couldn&#39;t quite place why. There was just something about the odd nature of whatever room you had stumbled upon that made it unnerving for you. You hastily drew back into the hallway and pulled the door shut, making sure to lock it as well. <br />
With no more doors in this stretch, you wandered to the corner bend of the hallway and turned it, finding a solitary door at the end, unlocked. You opened this next room, finding yourself entering a female&#39;s bedroom. The predominant colors here were gold and blue, which were present in the wall details, the floor, and even the pillows and bedspread. A vanity lay off to the side, with a circular mirror on the front and a little stool in front of it. <br />
<br />
Already, you found yourself liking your prospects in this room a lot more than other places. The bed was quite large, meaning you could fit easily beneath it. A large chest placed at the foot of the bed had lots of room for you as well, on top of items to place above you. You were very wary when approaching a closet door, considering what happened the last time you entered one, but this one seemed normal as you pulled it open. Inside was a huge walk-in closet, and it seemed that this room rivaled even the size of the primary bedroom. Clothes aplenty were placed on hangers on the shelves that lined the closet. There were drawers that were filled with smaller articles of clothing, like socks, bras, panties, and other little accessories.<br />
When your eyes came to what was at the end of the closet, you nearly turned tail in horror and fled as you saw a series of mannequins adorned in elaborate outfits at the end. However, there was something about these ones that didn&#39;t make you fully panic. Though they had wigs on their heads, their faces seemed a bit more stylized, rather than trying to be realistic. And, unlike the other mannequins, these ones were secure to their pedestals by metal poles that extended out of them. You were particularly drawn to one in the back, which had a long blonde wig and a large emerald-green dress. There seemed to be layers of skirts underneath, which obscured most of the shape of the lower body. Curious, you peeked underneath the dress, finding a pretty garter belt connected to tights and a set of high heels. The pole pierced the mannequin in between their legs, and it didn&#39;t seem to be wearing panties in order for it to be dressed, as the position of the pole wouldn&#39;t allow for panties to be worn. <br />
<br />
Provided you smooth out the dress, hiding beneath the mannequin was a very real possibility as well. You rapped your knuckles upon the mannequin&#39;s &#39;skin&#39;, which seemed to be of some type of rubber that acted like skin. Curiously, the mannequin seemed to waver a bit at that, as if it wasn&#39;t secured all that well.<br />
<br />
Before you could investigate that further, a piercing alarm noise cut through your thoughts as you brought your hands to your ear in distress. As you tried to comprehend what was going on, a robotic-sounding feminine voice rang out clear  from a speaker attached to the wall.<br />
<br />
WARNING. AN INTRUDER HAS ENTERED THE FACILITY. INITIATING LOCKDOWN SEQUENCE IN TEN MINUTES. ALL DOORS WILL BE SEALED SHUT FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS AS WE ENTER LOCKDOWN. DOORS WILL BE UNABLE TO BE OPENED DURING THIS PERIOD.<br />
<br />
You could hear the voice still echoing through your head as you took in what this mean. It must be those bunny mannequins! They must&#39;ve triggered the alarm.<br />
You had ten minutes to get somewhere before the doors would close for three hours, which meant that they were hoping to isolate you somewhere and find you during that time. You hadn&#39;t had all that much time to look for places to hide yet!<br />
<br />
You knew you had to act fast. The best place for you to be when the doors seal shut is...</p>
