<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda giggled with the chronivac as she selected herself. Her older sister Kimberly seemed to be treating her worse and worse as her breasts grew bigger and bigger. So obviously when she has even bigger boobs Kimberly will treat her like a goddess! Comparing her sister&#39;s C-cups... let&#39;s see C was the third letter of the alphabet... A is better than C so A-cups should be more than enough! Amanda typed in A-cups into her Breast size category which originally was shown as NA. Amanda was amazed as her chest got tingly and it puffed out a little. Curious Amanda groped herself a little and noticed how squishy they were, but she could easily tell that A-cups were indeed smaller than C-cups. Kimberly thought some more and came to the conclusion the farther into the alphabet you got the bigger the breasts you had. So obviously she went and put the letter Z, and the little girl was only a little more girl than boob as her shirt failed to cover a quarter of  her breasts. Kimberly thought to herself &quot;These are heavy, no wonder Kimberly thought I was weak when I had no burden. Well I&#39;ll show her! I&#39;ll carry these and prove I&#39;m superior!&quot; She went and checked around her family to see how she could help them out. Little did she realize that the cat had wandered it&#39;s way into her room.<br />

Gloria the mother was in the backyard grooming their golden retriever Rapunzel (they call Punny). It took a decent amount of strength to get Punny on the grooming table, but at least Punny enjoyed being groomed and getting her winter coat off so she wouldn&#39;t shed everywhere anymore. With each stroke it seemed like the hair was coming off easier and easier... too easy... in fact that&#39;s a red bald spot! Did she use too much strength?!? Punny didn&#39;t even whine or... wait... that red spot isn&#39;t skin... are those scales?!? Gloria didn&#39;t have much time to think as the dog&#39;s hair started falling out by itself as the mutt (mostly golden retriever, but not purebred) started growing as it&#39;s tail became closer to a sword on a rope, and it gained more and more reptilian features. Wings grew from it&#39;s back and as Gloria was backing up she tripped and fell backwards over the garden hose. She watched in terror as Rapunzel turned into a red dragon... and it was looking at her. <br />
<br />
Rapunzel let out a short roar and all Gloria could think or feel was sheer terror. In movies only the strongest of the strongest warriors in the lands could even survive a dragon encounter. What could she do? Rapunzel leaned down to Gloria and gave her a small lick. Well small for a dragon, Gloria ended up getting drenched by a tongue bigger than her body. Gloria didn&#39;t understand what to think. At least Rapunzel was still a dog on the inside... What on earth was going on? As Gloria tried to stand up she noticed something odd. She was sure she had been wearing some jeans and not a dress... also where were her shoes. Gloria looked down and saw that her shoes, socks, and jeans were empty... heck her shirt was very baggy as well, but she could still feel her body in one piece... She sat up and looked at her arms and noticed that her arms didn&#39;t exit the short sleeved shirt... Looking down the collar she easily saw a chubby body of a toddler. She was 3, maybe 4 years old at the oldest. What was Gloria going to do? The dog was a big dragon who was definitely not coming inside anymore no matter how much Keith or Joe begged. <br />

Keith the father was in a business meeting and doing a slideshow presentation. What was his position? What did the company do? What the the presentation about? Not particularly important as during the presentation Keith was sure he was doing a good job. On occasion he would hear a murmur or two. &quot;Good&quot; Keith thought &quot;They&#39;re paying attention, probably interested.&quot; however in the middle of the presentation the murmuring grew and seemed to be becoming higher pitched? Keith was curious about what was going on until he felt his body shifting. It wasn&#39;t painful or anything, but as he shrank a little in some places, a lot in others, and grows in a few particular places that were hard for Keith to miss Keith tried to walk to the light switch, stumbled a bit, kicked off his shoes easily, and then turned on the lights to see a bunch of middle-aged or elderly women in suits a little too big for them. <br />
<br />
The oldest lady of the group said &quot;I heard that TransDem was doing a beta for that Chronivac thing... I suggest we contact them and see what we can do.&quot; <br />

Joe the 14 year old brother was sure he was ready right? He had some flowers, his hair was brushed, he had that nice smelling deodorant and cologne on, his clothes were nice but not too nice right? Joe for sure knew that the senior Tracy was in the Starbucks which both often visited around the same times. Tracy for some caffeine and to use the free wifi, and Joe went for the atmosphere to write his D&D campaigns he&#39;s going to run... as soon as he finds some other players... Joe gritted his teeth. This was always his problem wasn&#39;t it? He always prepared and prepared. Always thinking of the perfect moment, but when the moment came he always convinced himself not to. Well not this time, Joe will rush in despite his logical self having several probably valid reasons he should just give up. <br />
<br />
Tracy was alone in the Starbucks enjoying her fat-free sugar-free latte. Having her gal pals around was fun, but it was nice to have some me time and browse the web a little. She often enjoyed reading some stories people made up, and sometimes enjoyed the crazy stories that came from games like D&D where idiots are given the power of magic to make fools of themselves with. Still it wasn&#39;t like some big barbarian could exist in the real world right? The Starbuck doors opened fast and the bells jingled rather loudly. There weren&#39;t many people in the store, but everyone looked and saw a man ripped with muscle, his slacks skin tight and a little short, his shirt stretched far across his broad chest showing off abs for days. He walked directly to Tracy. <br />
The young woman was screaming and rambling incoherently internally as the man took in a breath and then said &quot;Tracy, I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s going to be a party at the downtown warehouse. I was wondering if you would let me Joe Stone to the dance? I&#39;ll pay.&quot; Joe&#39;s voice was a little shaky from his nervousness, but it was deep and smooth. <br />
As the man outstretched the flowers Tracy accepted them kind of unsure what to do and said &quot;Well umm...&quot; Tracy set the flowers down on the table next to her phone and latte trying to think about what to say &quot;Well umm... I&#39;m just 17 not an adult yet so...&quot;<br />
Joe laughed and said &quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m 14!&quot; Most onlookers were calling bullshit at the modern Adonis being just 14. He could see Tracy was still shaken by his appearance but not believing him and so he said &quot;I&#39;ll be at the school library in the non-fiction section during lunch. If you want to accept you can find me there.&quot; and then left. Tracy took a few deep breaths trying to process what had happened... Was he really a high school student? <br />

Muriel was getting on in her years. She was glad both her and her husband had bought their house, and she were well off enough to hire a maid to help clean up the house. With her cane she wasn&#39;t sure she could clean the big house by her lonesome self. Her daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren would occasionally come over for visits and could probably help. However they had their own lives as well. Especially Kimberly who was almost an adult, and Joe who would be starting to advance into a fine young man. She smiled though thinking about Amanda, she was young and still loved spending time with Muriel. For sure Muriel would always be happy to babysit Amanda whenever no one else could... Muriel guessed that girl would eventually become an artist. <br />
Muriel opened the door to her garage and turned on the light which revealed a small unassuming car, and a red motorcycle well polished and clean. On the wall were two biker jackets hanged in frames and a chest of some old memories from back in Muriel&#39;s biker phase. She and her old departed husband used to ride that bike together, visiting places, bunking together at motels during road trips, and making each trip together that much more intimate as they were forced to huddle close together. So many good memories and the boy next door helped make sure that old motorcycle was running as well as it ever had. She smiled at the memory of the boy at 16 coming to her doorstep with a flyer for his little service. He&#39;d come and clean your house for a lot cheaper than the maids. The boy didn&#39;t want to work for some minimum wage so he decided to take initiative. Muriel liked his spunk and despite having maids coming over the next day invited him over to clean her house. That&#39;s where he ended up finding the old motorcycle which he had his eyes fixed to. The two ended up coming to the deal that if he got a license that allowed him to ride a motorcycle, his parents allowed him to, and he&#39;d repair anything he broke or scratched up she&#39;d let him ride it. <br />
Through the years the boy not only kept the old thing going, but let it thrive. Muriel helped pitch in for a new motor and some new parts, but the boy also pitched in a bit as well. He was an amazing mechanic and a decent driver as the motorcycle seemed to get better and better the more he was around it instead of in pieces like she had expected. She smiled thinking her husband in heaven must be happy knowing their old ride was thriving and being drove even now. She slowly walked to the framed biker jackets, and looked to hers. Those were great memories, and what she would give to be able to have one more great ride on that bike. The once boy now 25 year old man Joseph still lived with his parents, but was paying rent while working at a local mechanic. Muriel then looked at her cane and wrinkled old hand grasping it. There was no use in hoping, her body wouldn&#39;t be getting any fitter anytime soon. In fact it would just deteriorate. That motorcycle should belong to Joseph now. He could take good care of it, and she could honestly say that it belonged to Joseph now. She was just letting him use her garage space. <br />
She then saw her hand was looking funny... Well not funny but smooth. Nice firm and smooth. Getting out of her self-pity she looked at her arm and noticed that it was really smooth and supple. The aches her body gave her were gone, and trying to stand up straight... She could and she was taller. Looking at her framed biker jacket she saw her reflection and saw the face when she was in her twenties. her hair full of color and lush. She took a breathe and took down her biker jacket, looted her chest for some of her old clothes from her days biking that no longer fit, and went to quickly get changed. She found those old things still fit, and grabbed her copy of the keys to the bike. Getting on the bike she ignited the engine and felt the good vibrations, the garage door opened and she slowly walked out the bike as she closed the garage door again. She looked up to the sky with her helmet on her head. She had wished for one more ride right? She took a deep breathe and knew that even if she got a heart attack or was in a car accident and died for that one more ride... it would be worth it. This was the one thing she really wanted, and while she would regret ruining the bike for Joseph... and leaving her family behind... Especially little Amanda. This was something she needed to do. The neighbors heard the bike zooming down the neighborhood, but didn&#39;t expect there to be a woman driving it. <br />

Kimberly was hanging out with her BFFs doing their stuff. At 16 they were enjoying their lives and discussing things 16 year old teen girls do. Sometime in the middle of it one of her BFF&#39;s asked about her chest. At which point Kimberly looked and then noticed her bra was empty. She was completely flat chested! THE HELL WAS GOING ON?!?<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Amanda grinned at her changes. Now with the boob difference of non-existent verses the biggest boobs she would be Queen! Besides that she knew her brother was going to try to propose so she gave him a little boost to make him more handsome, she heard her mom talking about how she wanted a break and how kids were lucky and didn&#39;t have to do much so she turned her mom into a kid so she could take a break, also she remembered hearing her mother talking about how there aren&#39;t many women in management so she turned her dad and all those other old guys in the meeting into women, and even more she made her pets awesome!.. Although Felix didn&#39;t look like he appreciated being turned into a unicorn... Maybe she&#39;d undo Felix... However granny always looked tired and she wanted to be with granny more, so she made granny younger so the two of them could do even more together! She was so happy knowing there was no way any of them would be upset over her changes.</p>
