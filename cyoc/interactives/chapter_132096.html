<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked to the deletion package and wondered who to choose to remove.  Thinking of his options, he shrugged it off and said, “Oh what the hell…  I should choose myself to delete.  It’s not like it would actually erase me from existence, right?”<br />
<br />
So he headed to the name box and typed his full name, which is Jeff McCarran and clicked on the delete button.  Just then, a warning message appeared with a yes and no option and says…<br />
<br />
‘Are you sure you wish to delete Jeff McCarran.  Removing him will mean he will be lost and never recovered.’<br />
<br />
Seeing the options he chuckled and said, “Of course I want to delete myself.  No way I want to see how much BS with package is.”  So he clicked on the ‘yes’ option to begin the deletion of himself.  Just then, a window popped up with a progress bar that and a message that says…<br />
<br />
‘Deletion in progress…  Please stand by…’<br />
<br />
The progress bar started to slowly go up to 1% as Jeff started to get up and stretched for a little bit, waiting to see what happens.<br />
<br />
“Looks like the deletion has started.” he said feeling extremely confident, “I don’t think that this program can actually delete me.  This package must be a big joke.  Why would it actually delete a person if it didn’t-“<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, Jeff stopped mid sentence as his eyes glazed over and was in a trance.  His arms flopped down and he was stiff like a rock.  What just happened as the delete process has just started as the program started to cease his bodily functions.  His lungs stopped producing air, his heart stopped beating, and his brain was shut down.  It was as if he was dead, yet at the same time alive, as he stood in place like that of a statue.  That was the first stage of the deletion of Jeff.<br />
<br />
The second phase is to remove his clothing.  The laces of his sneakers begin to untie themselves until they grow smaller, going through the holes until they vanished completely.  Then the stitches unstitch themselves and the soles around his feet curled up and exposed his socks, sinking right up into the soles.  And then the soles begin to shrink under his feet until they disappeared completely.  Once the shoes were gone, his socks were next to go at the tips unravel to expose his toes and traveling up his feet.  As soon as they were got, the seams of his blue jeans were unraveling as well and traveled up his legs.  Reaching the top, the zipper lost it’s metal and the button grew smaller until it popped out of existence.  The belt then got affect as the buckles separated and the ring around it split and shrank while the pointer shrunk as well, vanishing completely.  The belt itself soon shrank by itself while the little holes disappeared one by one.  It spread around his waist until is disappeared into the ether.  With his pants gone, his shirt was next as the bottom seems of his waist and upper arms unravel and spread up his chest and shoulders before that too was long gone.  His watch he had one was affected as well as the hands on them shrank and sucked in while the surface of the watch crumpled and was removed.  The gears soon disappear one at a time until it was bare and the ring around it lessened from the inside and wiped away.  The leather straps of the watch soon unravel from the spot where the watch was and the buckle end did the same way as the pant’s belt, leaving his wrist armless.  The only thing that was left were the boxers he had on until it too unstitched itself and vanishes away, exposing his penis and rear.  Now Jeff stood there naked and was still frozen in place.<br />
<br />
Now the deletion package moved to the third phase.  All around his body, small pieces of him were starting to be removed.  The nails on his fingers and toes shrank into the skin and sucked up completely.  Small hairs on his arms, legs, and chest shrank into their skins and left him bear.  His belly button filled in and there was no evidence of it while his nipples shrank from nickels to pennies until they too popped out of existence, leaving his chest completely bare.  The blemishes, birthmarks, and pimples he had on him faded out, leaving his skin completely smooth and clean.  The hair on top of his head shrank up the top of his head and left him completely bald.  Pieces of his head started to disappear one by one as his eyes automatically close and zip up with the lashes sinking into the skin, eyebrows thinning and vanishing, earlobes growing smaller to nothing and the holes sealed shut, nose flattening and the two nostrils closing, and lips getting ironed out and the mouth sealed shut.  This in turn left his head completely blank with no definition what so ever.  The Adams apple on his neck slowly flatten until there is none, leaving a thin like neck of a woman.  His ass soon followed suit as the cheeks merged together and the anus collapsed and closed off completely, leaving behind a smooth rear.  The only thing that was left is his penis as the deletion spread to it.  The shaft started to go stiff automatically as it started to grow smaller while the slit on the mushroom tip sealed itself completely.  His balls began to shrivel and were sinking right into the skin.  His privates soon became baby size before they melted right into the skin and left behind a smooth surface.  Soon enough, Jeff didn’t look like Jeff at all, just a mannequin made out of flesh.<br />
<br />
On the fourth phase, the insides of his body begin to disappear.  All the veins of his body retracted throughout his body until they reach the heart before it begins to shrivel and dry up to become non-existent.  His lungs, kidney’s and liver deflated like a bunch of balloons until they too were no more.  His intestines and digestive system crawled upwards and unknotted themselves until it reach the stomach.  The stomach soon was drained away sagged before it shriveled up and vanished.  His eyes over his sealed lids popped into the skull and sucked into the brain, absorbing it completely.  His tongue grew smaller and melted right into his mouth while his uvula rose up and absorb into the top part of the mouth.  All of his teeth and sucked into his gums one at a time until it was left toothless as the gums rose up and disappear in the ridge of his mouth.  The brain dissolve away, growing smaller and smaller until it was no more.  All the muscles in his body deteriorated away until they were mostly hollowed out, but the muscles on the outside remain intact.  Lastly, his bones break apart and turned into dust, vanishing away to nothing.  Soon enough, the inside of Jeff’s body is completely hollowed out while the outside remained standing like a normal human being.<br />
<br />
When the deletion program got into the fifth phase, what’s left of his body begins to be removed.  Each of his fingers and toes were slowly sink into his hands and feet leaving each of them digitless.  Then his hands and feet begin to sink into the wrists and ankles.  His legs and lower arms soon shrank upwards to his knees and elbows.  Finally, his thighs and upper arms went all the way up to his hips and shoulders.  Soon enough, his body was completely limbless and even if he doesn’t have any feet or legs, his body was still flowing in the air like that of a physical ghost.  His blank head was next to go as the neck shrank downwards until the upper body and head merged together.  The head soon started to melt and absorbed right to the top part until all that’s there is a floating torso.  The final changes soon came at the shoulders and hips rounded out and the faint abs and chest smoothed over, curving into a sphere made out of flesh.  That sphere soon shrank more and more and was getting smaller and smaller until it popped out of existence.  Soon enough, Jeff was no more as he was completely deleted from the real world.<br />
<br />
By the time he vanished, the sixth change happened as the room begins to shift around and disappear.  The bed compressing and shifting as half of it lifted upwards, cushioned arm rests growing, and pillow merging with the mattress, turning into sofa chair.  The nightstand moving and changing as the four legs coming together and the table surface rounded, becoming a small rounded table with an alcoholic beverage and a remote appearing.  The sock and underwear drawer sprouted wheels and moved on their own while the rest of the changes took place.  Each of the drawers burst out and fell to the floor, disintegrating on contact while the socks and underwear unravel to nothing.  The rest of the drawer changed to the wood in the middle split and became thin stilts as the wooden surface hardened into metal.  A metal tray appeared in the middle and glass cups appeared in the middle while multiple alcohol bottles appeared on the cup.  This in turn turned the drawer into an alcohol tray to move around.  Jeff’s closet filled with clothes deteriorates until it is void of shirts, pants, shoes, and other forms of outfits as the hangers compressed disappeared.  The poles for the clothes soon split in the middle and spread to both ends while the wall spread, concealing the closet completely.  The book shelf next to the closet spread to the spot where the blank wall is and was more books and movies appeared on all of them, with Jeff’s books shifted to what looks like more adult readings and porno movies that are on the highest shelf.  The small TV screen immediately floated up and hung to the wall and upgraded to a super wide with an LCD clear-cut imaging.  The two gaming consoles that Jeff had took a bigger change as they started to grow vertically and shifted around, turning into surround sound speakers that is as why as the wide screen.  The desk shifted around and turned into something more fancy looking while the office chair upgraded and grew to something more professional.  Stuff that belongs to Jeff disappeared into mist as the posters hung on the walls detach themselves and rolled up to be super thin and blinked out of existence.  The only thing that has changed is the computer as it was still running the Chronivac continuing the deletion.  Jeff room was then turned into what looks like a man cave of some kind that someone as a father or an older brother would hang out in.<br />
<br />
Now the program has moved to the final phase as memories of Jeff started to vanish into the heads of anyone who knew him.  From family, to friends, to even Jeff’s girlfriend, memories of him were slowly fading away until they do not remember him at all.  Even pictures that have Jeff’s face faded out of existence while solo pictures shriveled and vanished completely.  When the final changes were finished, the Chronivac dinged and a new window appeared that says.<br />
<br />
‘Deletion Complete’<br />
<br />
In a matter of ten minutes, Jeff unknowingly deletes himself from the world and would never be recovered.  Now the Chronivac stands idly by, waiting for someone else to use it.</p>
