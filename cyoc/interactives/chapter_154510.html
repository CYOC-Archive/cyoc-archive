<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She should have been looking for a job but she was humming with so much excitement, Kathy began shopping. <br />
<br />
Her first stop was the mall lingerie store. Her boyfriend Rob often urged her to buy fun things, but she always felt self conscious spending his money and was embarrassed to try any of the really scandalous items, and insecure no matter how much Rob insisted she looked good in the outfits. She supposed she should feel sexy and confident dressing for her boyfriend, but no matter how much she tried to engage, she still felt somehow inadequate. For the first time ever, Kathy felt invigorated and excited as she entered the gaudy pink store.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Kathy happily held up items she would never have had the nerve to try before. There were so many she wanted, but ultimately selected a burgundy Embroidered Lace Babydoll. The sheer little skirt hanging from the bodice was all but transparent, displaying the little triangular patch of satin panties right through it. This was not something she’d normally ever consider, it seemed more naked than naked the way it pulled the eye and emphasized, the whole outfit made her feel vulnerable and weak. These habitual thoughts were swept away in a new euphoria, “PERFECT!”<br />
<br />
Stashing her pink bags in the car, Kathy ate a salad for lunch and planned her next set of purchases. These would be a more of a guess, but in their own way more fun than sexy lingerie. Grinning happily, Kathy entered the department store and headed for the Boys section. In short order she’d purchased two each of yellow logo tee shirts, and gray sport shorts with a green trim logo,  in both boys large and medium.  A pack of white footie socks in 9-11 and two packs of tighty whities in sizes 16 and 12.<br />
<br />
“This is going to be fun,” Kathy whispered to herself with excitement as her boyfriend came home.<br />
<br />
“Bad news Kat, I got laid-off today. I don’t think we need to worry too much, we’ve got enough saved to carry us for awhile and I’m confident things will work out ,” Rob declared before kissing his live in girlfriend. He was somewhat surprised and delighted by the passion with which she returned the kiss, mashing into him hard enough that she was bound to notice his sudden arousal. Not wanting to ruin the mood, Rob adjusted himself through his pocket and casually asked, “How was your day?”<br />
<br />
Kathy smirked at how transparent her boyfriend was. He was already flushed and excited, ‘This was going to be easy!’ <br />
<br />
“Wow; Oysters Rockefeller, asparagus with couscous, and wine! I feel like you’re trying to seduce me Mrs. Robinson,” Rob said.<br />
<br />
“I am so glad your last name isn’t actually Robinson, or I’d be getting that joke constantly,” Kathy quipped. “If you play your cards right, your evening just may be looking up,” Kathy giggled at her little double entendre . “I did a little naughty shopping today, but I can take everything back.”<br />
<br />
“No, money is fine for a while, it’s fine.” Rob was so excited he hardly noticed the fabulous dinner his girlfriend had prepared as he hurried through it. As they were cleaning up, Rob’s mind was not on the here and now when the word ‘heels’ got through. “Wait ... what?”<br />
<br />
“I said, I was thinking it might be fun to play with some heels but I was wondering if you might have a  problem if I was taller than you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh … no … that would be fun I think,” Rob said getting his mind back in the moment. “But you’re five inches shorter than me, that would be some pretty incredible heels.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t tell you, but I also bought some magic shoes and they are indeed incredible.” Kathy was tickled with the notion of telling Rob the truth knowing he wouldn’t believe it.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure what constitutes magic when it comes to shoes but, go for it.”<br />
<br />
“So you’re fine with me towering over you?”<br />
<br />
“Tower away if you can,” Rob laughed. “I look forward to it.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Kathy said embracing her boyfriend and looking up for a kiss. “We’ll kiss just like this, all snuggled in tight only you’ll be the one looking up at me.”<br />
<br />
“I’m up for it, although we might have to put you on a stool,” Rob said breaking the kiss.<br />
<br />
“Oh, one more thing. You get to create the heels. You can create any kind of shoe you like, and I’ll wear them. Now go take a shower while I change.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?”<br />
<br />
“I already told you, Magic Shoes! They can be anything you want,” Kathy said. ‘And I’ll most certainly want what you’ll want me to want,’ Kathy thought. “Now shoo! Go shower.”<br />
                      ----------<br />
Rob stepped out of the master bath completely naked and saw his girlfriend decked out in the most incredible diaphanous burgundy outfit. Kathy exuded a soft vulnerable femininity that begged for protection while simultaneously declaring an edibility that demanded to be taken by force and consumed. <br />
<br />
“I can see that you like the outfit,” Kathy teased, her eyes looking at Rob’s sudden erection.<br />
<br />
“Hey, my eyes are up here!” Rob faux complained.<br />
<br />
“Oh I know,” Kathy said walking across the room until she bumped into Rob’s now fully erect cock. “But you’re so tall, it’s HARD to look that high when you are towering over me,” she said grasping the head of Rob’s erection with her left hand.<br />
<br />
Rob was beside himself with arousal already as he bent down to kiss his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, not yet. You promised I could be taller than you.”<br />
<br />
Rob was confused, he’d promised no such thing, and it was impossible. “Uh, I don’t – “<br />
<br />
“Here, put these on,” Kathy said as she knelt down, kissing his penis in passing before tapping his right foot to be lifted. Slipping on the magically re-sizing pink slipper easily, she repeated the process for his left foot.<br />
<br />
Rob was even more confused when he looked down to see the pink satin slippers on his feet, and Kathy smiling happily up at him. “I don’t understand,” Rob said carefully, afraid that he’d somehow ruin the mood for his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“I told you silly, magic shoes. You get to make whatever shoes you’d like me to wear. All you have to do is command the shoes to be any style you like, and they become that style. Oh wait, before you do that, move over here.” Placing her right hand on Rob’s butt and briefly cupping his balls with her left, Kathy guided her boyfriend to stand facing her with the back of his knees directly against the side of the bed.<br />
<br />
“Kat, what are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
“I know it sounds crazy but the shoes really are magic. Humor me, command the shoes to be black.”<br />
<br />
“That’s … whatever … shoes turn black! Kat what is this – “<br />
<br />
“Look!” Kathy said interrupting and pointing.<br />
<br />
Glancing down, Rob’s jar dropped open to see that the slippers were black.<br />
<br />
“See! And it’s more than just color. Try something else, command them to be hiking boots maybe.”<br />
<br />
Kathy watched the amazement on Rob’s face as the shoes turned into thick soled hiking boots at his command. Carefully trying to see a difference in her boyfriend, the most obvious change was Rob’s softening penis as his attention focused elsewhere. She knew that Rob was now about an inch shorter in body but she just couldn’t detect any difference in his shoulders or arms, and of course his standing height relative to her was unchanged.<br />
<br />
“Holy Cow, this is impossible!”<br />
<br />
“I told you, it’s magic! Now unless you want me to wear hiking boots, which I admit might be interesting with this outfit,” Kathy said twirling and giggling for emphasis, “How about you command those shoes to become something you’d like to see on me.”<br />
<br />
“But couldn’t you do it yourself,” Rob asked.<br />
<br />
“I could, but this way will be a whole lot more fun,” Kathy purred, fondling her boyfriend back to full attention.<br />
<br />
Rob thought about what he’d like to see on Kathy and paused. “Wait, won’t this mean I’ll be wearing woman’s shoes?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s one of the fun parts,” Kathy laughed. “I get to see you in them first.”<br />
<br />
Blushing profusely, Rob said, “Shoes change to woman&#39;s black pumps with a two inch heel.”<br />
<br />
Covering her mouth to conceal her delight at how silly her boyfriend looked in sensible low heeled black pumps, she thought she could see that his shoulders and arms were somewhat smaller now, so too were his hands, but not by much. Fortunately everything else looked to be the same but it would be best to distract him. “You look lovely in those, perfect for the secretarial pool. Why did you choose that?”<br />
“I suddenly couldn’t think of any other woman shoe terms other than remembering you saying pumps.”<br />
<br />
“Let me help you out: sandals, peep toe, slingback, stilettos, platform, chunky heel, wedge heel, ankle strap, mules, fantasy heel, lace up, or anything you want. You can specify a minimum platform height if you like but the platform will become higher automatically to accommodate extreme heel heights as necessary. Oh and how about a more interesting color? Remember, make what you want to see me wear, and don’t forget, I need enough heel to be taller than you so don’t hold back.”<br />
<br />
“Ah … OK,” Rob hesitated. “Shoes, change to … ah … emerald green … ah … fantasy heel … slingback … stilettos … ah … with a seven inch heel,”Rob commanded. “If these actually work like you say, then the seven inch heels will will take you from five inches shorter to two inches taller than me. Not exactly towering, but probably as –,” was as far a Rob got before stumbling a bit when he found himself suddenly forced way up onto his toes.<br />
<br />
Smiling like the cat that ate the canary, or more like one that was about to dine on said canary, Kathy leapt forward and pushed her off balance boyfriend backward onto the bed. “These will work great!” She squealed, trying to keep her newly diminutive boyfriend confused and distracted as she madly hurried to strip the shoes off of his feet hanging out over the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! Kathy slow … slow … slow down.” Rob paused and cleared his throat several times because his voice sounded wrong.<br />
<br />
Hurriedly stepping onto the seven inch stilettos and adjusting the slingback, Kathy grinned as she stood up and proclaimed, “Nine inches!”<br />
<br />
“Nine inches?” Rob asked in a puzzled voice from his sprawled position on the bed. “What’s nine inches?”<br />
<br />
“Nine inches taller than you with these shoes. I get to loom!”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s simple math. Seven inches of heel minus my five inch height advantage equals two inches,” Rob said condescendingly.<br />
<br />
“Oh no sweetie,” Kathy chortled. “Seven inch heels take me from five foot five to six feet.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not really six feet tall Kat, but no matter, that’s still only two inches over my five foot ten.” A little voice in Rob’s head chastised him, ‘She’s in the mood stupid, let her have her fantasy.’<br />
<br />
“Not five foot ten sweetie. You forgot the other seven inches you put in the shoes. Five foot ten minus seven inches is five foot three. Five three, six feet, nine inches, it’s simple math cutie,” Kathy snickered.</p>
