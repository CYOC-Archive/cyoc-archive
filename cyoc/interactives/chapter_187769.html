<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once they were certain Rachel had left, Rina turns to Maya and asks &quot;so let me guess, Rachel still lays eggs, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I never will remove that feature. She nearly tore my head off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You totally deserved it though&quot; remarked Rina. Maya just shrugged, &quot;perhaps, but either way, did you see her face when she laid her eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was strangely... lewd, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He he he, that&#39;s because I set it to feel 3 times as good as a normal orgasm. She basically felt as if she came 3 times every time she popped out an egg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God you are perverted. She is our sister you know&quot; criticized Rina as she stood up. She waddled over to the side of Maya and got down onto all fours which due to having hoof-like fingers, was a fairly comfortable standing position. She watched her sister continue messing around with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Some of the things Maya did were simply unnecessary, such as giving their mom a fully functioning penis for a clitoris, converting one of her ovaries into an internal testicle, and after Rina reminded her, making it impossible for her to get herself pregnant with her own sperm. For this though, they toggled on the reality alteration as well as made it that only the two of them would notice anything different than &quot;normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maya also made her mom extremely dominant, while in turn, made her Dad super submissive to her. Then after a second thought, just flat out turned him into a small and feeble woman who actually needs someone to do most things for her due to her being so weak and helpless. <br />
<br />
Rina argued that if this is their new reality, then wouldn&#39;t they have 2 moms now? Where one is an absolute amazonis of a futanari and the other is just a helplessly frail and delicate woman? Maya nods agreeing that what Rina said pretty much summarizes it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look Maya, all I am saying is that if these are our parents, then how the hell are you a catgirl, how am I a cowgirl, and how can Rachel lay eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a good point. Hmm, maybe aI can get our Dad-Mom to be a chimera of sorts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no. Mmm, let&#39;s make Dad-Mom into our surrogate mother. Then make it so that our actual Mom fucked a few animals and then had the fetuses transferred into Dad-Mom to grow and eventually birth&quot; suggested Rina. Maya loved the idea so she implemented it right away. She also noticed that their Dad-Mom&#39;s name changed from Geoffrey into Grace. He once 6&#39;-2&quot; shrunk to nearly 5&#39; even and her weight literally halved. <br />
<br />
Next, Maya opened up Rachel&#39;s profile again, but this time kept the memory alterations turned on. She turned her arms into wings and feet into bird talons again, then gave her her bird tail and cloaca back. Rina wasn&#39;t as thrilled to be doing this as Maya was though. &quot;Hey, she hated being a harpy. Please don&#39;t make her into one by force like this, it feels wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maya sighed, &quot;ya know, sometimes you can be a total buzzkill. But... haaa, you do have a point.&quot; Maya then changed the settings again, turning Rachel into some kind of wereharpy. Like a werewolf, but instead of the moon, made her trigger to be the sight of fresh eggs. Basically forcing her to transform daily. But she set the durration to have a relatively short minimum time of 10 minutes, but can then be undone at anytime after that.<br />
<br />
Next Maya turned her focus to outside her family, and specifically towards her next door neighbor who she always has disliked. The guy was just some old man who actually has nothing better to do than to find things to complain about. Just last week he made a fuss about how he couldn&#39;t think over all the noise Maya and Rina (back when they were still boys) were making while playing in their backyard in the middle of the afternoon. This caused their mom to make them play inside for the rest of the day. So it was time for some payback.<br />
<br />
Maya quickly brought up his profile and as per the pattern, first made him female. Then made her much younger, 23 to be exact, and made her have a history of babysitting them with Rachel, who now is one of her best friends as well. Maya then made her personality out to be extremely nice too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait that&#39;s it? Just an incredibly nice young woman this time? No animal parts or something?&quot; Asked Rina in a sarcastic manner. Maya grinned to this. &quot;Oh, so you are interested in this afterall. Sure, I can make her have something extra. Any suggestions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, first of all, I am not that interested. I just was asking a question is all. But as for a suggestion... umm...  ooh! Give her like a scorpion body with like, claw hands or something. That would be so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, ok? Sure. I mean, what else but a scorpion woman comes to mind when you think of someone who is absurdly nice and great with children?&quot; Mocked Maya.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. I already am doing it. Let&#39;s see, full scorpion body minus the head... and attach it to her waistline. Replace her arms with the scorpion&#39;s arms, no, let&#39;s  just add them to her as a second pair of arms... hmm, she needs way larger boobs, and let&#39;s make her pussy out on full display right in front. Anything else Rina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, can she be lactating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah she can! And now you have a milking friend too.&quot; <br />
<br />
They looked over everything, then Maya made one last change, making her almost constantly horny and have a specific thing for her 3 neighbors who are all also part animal like herself. And in addition, made her very open about it too. Then confirmed the changes. <br />
<br />
In less than a minute, the sound of numerous chitin covered legs could be heard climbing up the side of their room before a cute but naked scorpion girl with straight long bonde hair that draped over her nipples and down to her bellybutton climbs in through their open window and quickly scoops up Maya before she could even react. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Maya, Rina. Aww, you are such an adorably cute kitty as always Maya. Maya would be trying to get away if the girl, whose name is now Felicia, or Fel for short, had not put her hand around the nape of her neck, practically paralyzing her while calming her at the same time. In other words, the absolute weakspot of all cats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fel, you can just stun my sister whenever you want to cuddle with her. She is going to start hating you if you keep doing it.&quot; Cautioned Rina while holding back her laughter at the current state of Maya. The catgirl, while she couldn&#39;t move, was purring up a storm as Fel stroked and petted her all over. She had already forgiven her too, as her petting felt really really good. So good that she practically was melting in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are the two of you up to?&quot; Inquired Fel as she set Maya down, who just took a minute to recover herself from the hyper relaxed state she was just put into suddenly.</p>
