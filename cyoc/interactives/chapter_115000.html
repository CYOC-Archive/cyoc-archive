<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What&#39;s it like becoming a were?&quot; Martha answered, her eyes blinking rapidly with some surprise as she talked with Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Betty said with a nod, &quot;Moon Lake may be a small town, but we do have enough local news to know that your family moved here before the school year started and that your husband was clawed by Yvette Smith, turning him into a werefox. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that you then became a were as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen watched as Martha glanced to Jenny and Harry for a moment and then looked back to Betty. Karen had some idea on what it would be like for her, thanks to her talks with Regina. She also had a vague idea on how she would turn out as a werelion based on meeting the rest of the Talbot family.  While all the Talbot women were well muscled and athletic and likely fit into an E cup bra with ease, they weren&#39;t carbon copies of one another. There were various differences between them showed that no two werelionesses were exactly alike. However, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that wasn&#39;t above listening to another woman&#39;s opinion on the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. I suppose that depends on how one joins were society and what you&#39;re asking with regard to the sensation,&quot; Martha said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I... I can vaguely remember when I began to change into a vixen for the first time,&quot; Jenny commented as she looked over to Betty, &quot;I remember waking up and feeling unbelievably aroused as I was needing to complete my transformation at that time... but there was nothing really special about it... or about completing my transformation. Don&#39;t get me wrong... I LOVE being a werefox. It brought me closer to Harry and really showed me how important Harry will always be to me, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that my entrance into were society wasn&#39;t of my choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And William would feel the same way,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;but for me... and I&#39;d assume for Harry as well... becoming a were is a wonderful sensation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha glanced over to see Harry actually smile and take Jenny&#39;s hand in his. Jenny also glanced to him and smiled, getting the sensation that he was doing better than he was earlier in the day. After a moment, Martha continued her explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was already bisexual before William and I moved to Moon Lake,&quot; Martha explained, &quot;and I&#39;ve always been something of a cat person. We made some good friends with a pair of werecats who were more than willing to help me, particularly when William got scratched and became a werefox, meaning that I&#39;d NEED to become a were just to stay with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And these friends helped you?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and smiled, &quot;Yes. They helped me... and it let me transform into what I am now. And it was a wonderful sensation... some things may have been a bit uncomfortable, particularly with the growth of my tail, the lengthening of my feet, and the alterations to my skull as I transformed... But with my friends there to help me through the transformation, there was no great pain, and their presence enhanced the pleasure that I felt and made the transformation special for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in pure theory, it&#39;d be the same for you and Huck,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;whatever discomfort you may feel will be negated by the fact that you&#39;re with the man you love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty smiled to both Jenny and Martha as thoughts of her being with Huck and his comforting her through her first transformation did feel good. That there was no dramatic pain, provided Huck stayed with her also felt good. She sat and smiled for a few moments. Karen, meanwhile felt the same thoughts, of herself with Peter and with him comforting her through everything as she enjoyed both him and her first transformation. It proved to be a very nice daydream. Her thoughts were interrupted when she heard a voice coming from the door to Huck&#39;s room. It attracted attention, and revealed Lisa Jenkins standing at the door, asking for Henry Jenkins Sr. and Harry. Both Jenkins males politely got up, with Jenny giving Harry a smile, and walked in to give a few best wishes with what little time they had left before visiting hours ended.<br />
<br />
With that, William stood up from his chair and moved to be closer to Martha while Lisa moved to sit between Betty and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what were you ladies discussing?&quot; Lisa asked to Jenny and Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty was inquiring as to how becoming a were would feel,&quot; Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the answer is that so long as my induction is with Huck... it won&#39;t hurt and will be special,&quot; Betty gave something of a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes sense, dear, &quot; Lisa Jenkins put a hand Betty&#39;s knee and that made Betty feel fairly well about her situation. She liked that.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one question left would be what would I look like?&quot; Betty wondered, &quot;I mean... if I become a weredog... would I just be a generic looking dog with my hair color? Would I be as cute as Huck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d look fine,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;but I&#39;d think how you turn out is going to be hard to predict. Everyone keeps telling me that most of the werefoxes here are based off of the Red Fox. Yvette is a Red Fox Werevixen... yet, I am based off of the Fennec Fox and Harry is based off of the Gray Fox. I don&#39;t think there is any way to tell exactly what your fursona will look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;re with the one you love, it won&#39;t matter,&quot; Martha added.</p>
