<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The spacious interior of the Creature Cafe was a relaxing place, but this time, it would serve as a meeting hub for 8 Traveling students. The group consisted of Me, You, Anthony, Benjamin, Charles, Diane, Emily, and Francine. Taking place in a past era of life, a few years fresh out of high school and a few years into college, this experience would transport us into the 21st year of our lives where the energy of youth collided with the awakening responsibilities of adulthood. We were all young adults now with new responsibilities on our hand, work, overtime, studies, and people who valued our real life commitments. If anything, perhaps a bit too much.<br />
<br />
We worked hard and constantly to raise ourselves out of situations, picking up extra work, studying past the crack of dawn until days had passed working overnighters fueled by only cans of coffee and light snacks to get projects done, sometimes working up to 70 hrs within a week to get things done. It was time to look for a vacation, and perhaps enjoy one as well as a break from our busy lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
The morning came after we had all managed each of our respective duties, some free spirits with majors that didn&#39;t require much more than a study and a nod, a video and a quiz done within 20 minutes. Others were working on coding projects and engineering chain assignments alongside rows upon rows of calculus homeworks that often took literal 8 pages of paper to work through or more, due weekly or sometimes bi daily. Some of the other students even doubling single or double part time jobs just to make the ends meet with the standards of modern inflation.<br />
<br />
We were tired, pooped and yet eager for a taste of freedom looking forward to that one summer.. or perhaps back for some. The taste of adulthood yet the freedom of youth.<br />
<br />
We sat at tables and looked at the large map displayed on one wall with our name titles over various sites. The creature Cafe this time, would only be our meeting point as they served sides of normal, yet still delicious food. It would be a mix of vacation, but also a slice of life, with a bit of trouble mixed in, but with a bit of focus on the journey and the fun.<br />
<br />
I sat there, opening my eyes as I came first to a empty wooden table, waiting for the others to arrive, you and Anthony came first, as i waved my hand over &quot;Greetings, Welcome to the Cafe!, What&#39;s on the menu!&quot; i said with a smile, beckoning over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adventure, a little excitement, and a break from all those hard and weary travels of life! Let&#39;s live a little, and have some fun! There is joy in all things, and certainly you little horndogs can have some fun.. But I was thinking. The best thing is anything you want can happen, time free, and we can do as much as we want, whenever we want! Remember those days camping out as a kid? Those days of being care free, not many responsibilities. Certainly not these 30-50 hr assignment sleep eaters!&quot; roared Anthony with a smile, beckoning over as he threw a packet full of his Mechanical engineering assignments into a School pile and put on his vacation clothes.<br />
<br />
I laughed a bit as i turned back, two more people coming in as Charles and Diane came next. &quot;Yeah! That sounds great! When i was a kid i loved to go camping, sitting underneath the fresh forest air, looking at the lakes and seeing the star filled midnight sky pass through, it was great!&quot; chirped Charles back.<br />
<br />
Diane followed next. &quot;Yeah, sex can feel great sometimes, but there&#39;s more to life than just sastifying a primal urge.. Even if sometimes there&#39;s nothing better, most people have more minds than just one urge.. Even if sometimes it takes over sometimes like a light switch, once you flick it off and get that fix, it&#39;s still pretty normal to want other things out of life. It&#39;s mostly just hormones making us want a dick to go inside of something. Lets not lie, they can be pretty strong and if you try to resist them, they just build up until you&#39;re a almost ready to cum, brainless, backfired mess as trying to resist them to extremes only just makes them more powerful. But then when you&#39;re done and you don&#39;t need it anymore, you kinda get a taste for something else right? I mean.. lets be honest.. We&#39;re not puritans or unkinky saints here hehe, But.. Adventure sounds really fun!&quot; smiled Diane, a bit of a red flush on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, real straight Diane! You don&#39;t love it at all? I can see you moaning like a whore and gasping when you see those cocks flying around you. Why, we had sex just last night!&quot; teased Charles, a Shit eating but harmless, teasing smile on his face as he turned red too. Diane laughed and shot right back &quot;Oh yeah! I remember your tiny ass dick gave a show, no wonder it took so long, i had to wait for you to sastify me!&quot; Diane shot back with a good hearted but devilish grin on her face.<br />
<br />
The group gulped for a moment, watched as Charles was roasted and he turned a bright bright pink, red as a balloon as the crowd laughed. But it seemed like the two were friends. Or at the very least, good acquaintances. Charles smiled a bit but almost looked like he died inside, but they looked like good friends with good boundaries. &quot;H.. Hey!.!&quot; Stammered Charles back, turning a bit red. He picked up his hands and stuck them up in surrender, and the group laughed a bit.<br />
<br />
They were a good lighthearted couple, enough to take light humor with a joke and not fight or turn it into a disaster, but just a bit impulsive, a little rowdy, a little chaotic. Just like the scout troops of old. I laughed a bit and put down my drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha. Sometimes it&#39;s nice just to relax a bit, ain&#39;t it?&quot; I smiled, turning back to give a wave back to you. Before i turned my eyes a bit. &quot;Though.. I&#39;m a bit afraid... I can&#39;t see you very well, so I&#39;ll just have to imagine what you might look like. You could be old, young or tall, but i imagine if you&#39;re here, enjoying a drink and a meal here now, you&#39;re probably looking for a bit of fun, escapism, or fantasy or a bit of spice of life. I guess fiction is a place people come to escape the worlds of it&#39;s all? Lets live a little.. We could go White water Rafting, watch the wildlife for coyotes, cougars, moose, elk, grizzly bears, bison, wolves and falcons and eagles, there&#39;s even falls, campsites, cornhole, and even some mythical creatures like Wendigos, Chupricabras, Native American Skinwalkers, Jackalopes, and ghost stories we could tell!&quot; I smiled a bit, waving back. &quot;After all, when the world is your oyster, why not explore it a bit here with us?&quot; i said, smiling back.<br />
<br />
The group laughed and butted bear hugs and handshakes with each other. Charles and Anthony gave each other a spontaneous chat and soon got into a arm wrestling contest with each other for 5$ as they laughed.. Anthony was taller, but Charles was a bit shorter and stouter. Both of their arm muscles bulged as they wrestled with each other. &quot;That&#39;s fiver is gonna be Miner!&quot; yelled Charles, while Anthony smiled back. &quot;Oh yeah. You&#39;ll need it for your poor ass! Gonna buy yourself a shower at the camp huh?&quot; as they both jested while the Girls laughed, rolled their eyes and talked about makeup and latest fashion models.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eventually after much struggling, both of the men&#39;s arm muscles bulging, the arm swinging back and forth between both the two every few seconds, finally getting hold of each others arms and duking it out, Anthony knocked Charles&#39; arm off his side, sending him off balance as Charles rolled onto his back falling, having gained the upper hand when his muscles flexed quickly enough to move far more weight to the rest of the body as he tried again for another shot.. His arms fell down.. But it was just a feint as suddenly the match ended with a sudden snap as Charles smacked the hand down to the table!<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets call for pizza! And make it 2 pieces!&quot; Anthony cried with a laugh, as they made their way and Charles turned red. 5$ later, the buck was tossed over for the waiter as they went to bake a fresh wood fired pepperoni pizza. Perhaps a great cheesy pun was in there for a peppery Oni, but soon the 5$ had slapped down into a fresh and cheesy 8 slice of pizza.<br />
<br />
Everyone grabbed a slice as the gooey mozzarella dripped down the hungry student&#39;s tongue, molten, cheesy, thick and stringy. You could hear the crust softly crack with a &quot;crCRUNCH... crr-CRUNCH!&quot; with every one of our bites as Anthony and Charles continued to spar. &quot;Oh, I would have won if ya weren&#39;t a filthy cheater!&quot; As Charles laughed, taking a bite of the pizza with his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.. Wait.. Did i forget Benjamin guys?&quot; i nodded, looking around. Charles and Anthony gave a smile.. Glancing around... They glared back with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.. As a matter of fact.. I don&#39;t think we have yet! I think he was testing out his sleeping bag at home. Real expensive plush and fluffy one, supposed to keep you really warm and lightweight with goose down! I know where he&#39;s in. The filthy guy&#39;s probably sleeping in to his own vacation! Hey, i had someone sleep at scouts once.. I&#39;m friends with him, lets sneak in and wake him up, and if he doesn&#39;t, i bet you 20$ we can carry him into our truck!&quot; yelled Anthony with a playful smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; chirped Charles back, smirking at his friend as he held his hand up. &quot;Deal.&quot; Anthony responded in kind. &quot;We&#39;ll have two Trucks, and I worked out with a friend we can use his vacation home as long as we don&#39;t trash it and take care of it, let&#39;s get this party started!&quot;<br />
<br />
We went to go pick up Benjamin as we left the Creature Cafe, laughing as a pair of friends as we raced to the two trucks for the boys, Anthony&#39;s was a Red pickup Truck with black cloth seats, and trunk full of Beef Jerky, Trail mix, Fresh Submarine Sandwiches and two coolers of Drinks and food, and Charle&#39;s Truck was a Bright flashy yellow pickup truck as well, with leather seats and a soundbar, entertainment system, and cringy rap blasting out the window. &quot;Oh! Shit, go turn that off, you&#39;re gonna kill someone with your cringe!&quot; yelled back Anthony as he laughed back, tossing a walkie talkie over to Charles as he got to the cars and we all jumped in, and a pink Sedan for the girls, who were now shifting conversations from various shades of the same red color of makeup, to whether or not males possessed the marketing abilities to differentiate between the same shade of lipstick sold as Rosewood Red, Ruby Red, Flamenco Red, Rose Red, Dark Rose Red, Light Rose red, red, french in red, Italian Red, Car paint Red, Blood Red, Red but italain, and red but also red.<br />
<br />
<br />
Charles took one look as a box of apparently 37 different shades of red lipstick that all looked the same, turned pale with a phantasm of terror as one of the girls asked him to identify which one from the 37 nearly identical sticks of makeup, and then jumped into his car and ran away. &quot;TO BENJAMIN WE SHALL GO, AND THE ROUGE LIPSTICKS SHALL GO!&quot; Charles yelled, fearful for his life, throttling on the gas as the ladies gave a frowning disapproving death glare and threw the lipsticks on the ground, before scrambling to pick them up as we got into the cars.<br />
<br />
You and I jumped into the remaining car as we jumped into Anthony&#39;s red Truck and went to pick up Ben, mud spitting out the mudflaps as he piled on the pedals, The engine kicking in as the truck engine ROARED off the ground as mud splattered off the wheels and the engine jumped 0-60 mph down the streets to the highway to find it&#39;s way down to Benjamin&#39;s Home! <br />
<br />
{30 Minutes later!}<br />
<br />
The roads took us to a nice suburban neighborhood, a nice white suburban house, complete with a small patio and a backyard Grill and 4 square windows took us to see Benjamin snoozing inside of his tranquil house.. It was 8:31 am in the Morning, and we wanted to arrive in time for the 10 hour drive! <br />
<br />
Charles and Anthony honked. &quot;IT&#39;S THE ZOMBIE APOCLAYPSE MOTHERFUCKER!!! YOU HAVE TO GET OUT! WE ALL DIED AND WE&#39;RE NOW GHOSTS HAUNTING YOUR DREAMS.. WOOoooOOO!!!!! WOOO!!ooooOOO!&quot; yelled Charles and Anthony, the latter breaking out into a snort, as we stopped the vehicle and knocked. Benjamin snored and lifted up his groggy eyes, a pile of finished homework falling out. &quot;It&#39;s the summer Break! You&#39;re not needing to be a work slave anymore, let&#39;s go enjoy ourselves!&quot; they yelled.. Benjamin groaned and looked tired.. he blinked for a while.. nodded.. and then passed back into a groggy and well earned sleep.. Anthony and Charles nodded devilish eyes, and then with a yelp, both went to go pick up Benjamin as he yelped within his bright blue goose down sleeping bag and dragged him down the stairs into the truck! &quot;POLICE, 911, We&#39;re initiating a robbery! Bring us 10 pounds of beef jerky, or Benjamin gets the ice bucket challenge! Hurrah, lets DO THIS!&quot; they hollered and yelled, the chaotic duo giving each other a high five as Benjamin mumbled and sleeped restfully before groggily waking up in the car.<br />
<br />
Everything that was once silent, still, calm and serene.. was now erupting in jovial college vacation laughter. Benjamin wrapped himself up as the pair of us left.. and began our Road trip.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. I&#39;ve heard of Yellowstone a bit before. But what kind of trouble did you guys have in mind? Becoming real world ghouls and terrorizing the expanse, or like.. What kind of stuff is there to do in the dirt?&quot; Benjamin asked, yawning as he wiped a bit of sleep from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you insulting camping? Roughing it in the woods, watching the stars under your eyes and getting up close and up to the animals?&quot; Anthony shouted back, making Ben blush a bit and smile shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. Just trying to figure out what you plan on doing.. Is it worth it? Do you even want to go there? Are you prepared for the weather? There are bears, mountain lions, rattlesnakes and snakes.. So does everyone know how to avoid these dangers? How dangerous is it?&quot; asked Charles, rubbing his chin in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are a lot of things to see.. But if we all agree, it sounds like a good idea! I think we should all find out together! Also, animals are bloodseeking missiles, and love body warmth. And also smell fear, so i think you&#39;ll probably die first!! And dying is awesome!&quot; snorted Anthony, his devilish face withholding every urge not to burst out in laughter, causing Benjamin to gulp and eyes open in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dying is amazing! Dying is such a good thing! Makes people want to live! There is nothing like dying! Death is good. Duh!! It&#39;s better than sex!!&quot; Chirped back a walkie Talkie, Charle&#39;s Voice from the other car breaking through!<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s wrong! Anything is fucking better than fucking DEATH!!! Death is so very bad. Think about it, someone dies. That means something is lost forever! Something that can never come back. Like, maybe someday, your parents might say &quot;Oh, I remember you as a baby! Oh, I remember when you were alive! I remember when you weren&#39;t mauled to death.. BY FUCKING ANIMALS!&quot; screamed Benjamin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, that is true! We&#39;re gonna go visit all the native wildlife to be RIPPED apart by them! Just like a real nature movie! Come on, didn&#39;t you see the last movie where the cameraman recorded themselves being eaten?&quot; said Charles with a shit eating, teasing grin as he teased Benjamin a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;But man! If a sexy werewolf offers you a choice of being ripped to shreds and becoming another meal. Or riding on a thick juicy cock, You by Scout&#39;s Honor.. Have to admit you&#39;d go for being ripped open to death, and never touch any puritanical abombination on this earth such as SEX again! Don&#39;t you know! Your parents created us all from Test Tubes, and there are STDs out there! What if the werewolf has realistic herpes and genital warts like real human people and instead of turning you into some awesome epic badass wolf, gives you real life aids instead!?!? You&#39;re a heretic if you would never pick fantasy werewolf sex with no real consequences over real life herpes, you absolute degenerate! What the hell is wrong with you!? Your great ancestors got undiagnosed STDS to bring you here, are you going to be a degenerate spongebrain and elect to not have the real thing!?!?&quot; Anthony chimed back, Laughing lightheartedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, YES YES!!! You know how many people die yearly online from reading books.. ZERO!! So what if i&#39;m a square, you can&#39;t just make fun of me and!&quot; -{Benjamin was soon cut off} &quot;Hey! Hey calm down dude, You&#39;re welcome here and we&#39;re glad you&#39;re for the ride! We&#39;re just joshing and joking around a bit! My brother used to do the same when i was a kid, and it&#39;s been years since i&#39;ve had time to relax a bit.&quot; Cut in Anthony. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD OOH MY GOD IM GOING TO DIE DIE OHMYGOD&quot; stammered Benjamin as he shaked in his seat, face filled with teasing horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, It&#39;s real alright! Hah!&quot; Anthony followed on with a jabbing smile. we&#39;re just pulling your leg here Benjamin.. Just a little fun that&#39;s all! Well, we played around with the idea, but i think people&#39;s written appetite and real appetite might not match up for a monster murder story. Nah, Don&#39;t worry Ben! This is gonna be lighthearted. Hell. Maybe you won&#39;t even have to worry about being eaten, maybe a nice hunky cougar or wolf might take interest in you with a nice throbbing snack bag and just go for it! You always thought those pictures online were sexy right? This is gonna be a blast!&quot; Anthony chimed in with a smirking smile.<br />
<br />
Charles soon came over the radio. &quot;Heh. Yeah i wish. I do think werebeasts are kinda cool, but when you make them big teddy bears it kinda loses some of the scary appeal.. I always thought like 7 feet tall, hulking muscled werebeasts past wolves like werecats, werecougars and tigers could have been kinda cool.. Ripping arms for meat! But.. i don&#39;t think anyone would be into the fantasy of becoming little tiny tin meat dinners or cat food haha.&quot; <br />
<br />
Benjamin chimed back. &quot;Oh! I love Werewolves, I think it&#39;s so cool that there are stories out there. But i mean.. What&#39;s wrong with both? I mean... Maybe even big scary werewolves for a story and i&#39;d love to see them in more games! But i mean.. Sex and Violence just don&#39;t mix, Nobody wants to see blood mixed with the other stuff, Yuck! Like.. Outside of game ratings.. Aren&#39;t the two kinda mutually exclusive? I mean.. You can&#39;t blame people for saying they&#39;ll want a big.. Flesh ripping werewolf who could rip them apart.. Then then actually want a big giant cuddly boyfriend to make them feel warm and cuddly and... OH GOD WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING TO ME!!&quot; yelled back Benjamin. &quot;NO, But wait.. Why aren&#39;t there female werewolves in stories.. You guys ever notice that? And.. If all their clothes rip apart.. How come they never picture the men as naked either? Couldn&#39;t they just have the female werewolves clothes just magic itself back on? I mean.. Female werewolves kinda seem like just this odd void right? You ever notice that like.. There&#39;s like a bazillion female vampires, but all the werewolves are like hicky lumberjacks? What if you got bitten.. and part of the requirements for being a female werewolf was you turned into a male lumberjack... OH GOD, is that WHY they don&#39;t exist!?!?&quot; Yelped Benjamin!<br />
<br />
Anthony hollered back. &quot;Well, i mean that&#39;s the thing about fantasy being a escape right? I guess some people want grim, other people want a escape from their dull, or stressful lifes. People read stories to get a escape and dream of a land where magic is possible, and anything can happen right? But i mean.. yeah.. It&#39;s kinda weird there aren&#39;t any Female werewolves, But i mean.. Then that might give people the wrong idea.. Werewolves are all about the fantasy of becoming like.. Something bigger and stronger..  But if you put a dick in it.. People will only read up to the part where something starts shooting cum.. And.. Well.. I guess...&quot; Anthony stops for a moment and frowns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Charles, this is a hypothetical question, but if you suddenly had a say, large throbbing cougar cock rammed in your ass, would you forget i exist as soon as there was sex? Like.. You would just turn into a being who cared nothing about story. Instead you&#39;d turn into like.. a living being that only cared about the sex in a story. Even if.. It is a Sex story.. Would you still read the parts that were meant to be fun, and like build up the characters? Or.. Would you just home in after the sexy parts for the animal cocks.. Even if people wrote other stuff too?? Do you like Penises and the sex.. more than any of the ideas or thoughts of the characters?&quot; Anthony pauses, turning his head back for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;JESUS what kind of question is THAT to ask out of the blue! What the JESUS CHRIST FUCK!?!?! WHAT THE FUCK ANTHONY!?!?&quot; Charles BLARED!?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s just a hypothetical question! If you had your mind mentally blasted out by a throbbing, wet, squirming cock that started overriding all mental instincts, and then turned you into a involuntarily quivering pile of gasping, moaning pleasure, knowing you shouldn&#39;t find it attractive, and yet being unable to find yourself holding on against base instinct.. Would you forget everything in the world if you just got cummed in!&quot; Anthony trollishly replies, his bright eyes gleaming with mischief.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANTHONY, THAT&#39;S THE LAST THING I WANT TO THINK ABOUT ON A ROAD TRIP.. DO YOU THINK I&#39;M GAY! ABSOLUTELY NOT! I.. I wouldn&#39;t find a giant throbbing animal cock ATTRACTIVE! HELL NO! I mean! Urr.. I mean! That&#39;s forbidden, what the hell is WRONG with you! Urg..... I mean! No! I&#39;m absolutely would never be into that at ALL!! NO.. I Absolutely. Wouldn&#39;t!! Of Fucking.. Course!!... Urr!!! AHHH!!&quot; Charles screams, but something about him seems bothered by the thought sticking around more than it should.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Charle&#39;s mind had it&#39;s tainted seed planted.. Anthony&#39;s jesting, soon led him to have the picture creep out of the blue stronger than it should.. What should have been a sideways thought, kept returning involuntarily into his head.. now the head mentally assaulted by the image of a large, thick red throbbing barbed animal cocks on a large feral den of cougars.. Each a prime specimen.. Smiling as the mental picture of Charles, caught up in all his camp gear approached their den... Their attention.. Was more than hunger today.. instead of opening up their teeth... They surrounded him in a circle.. Him shivering.. Even though he was strong and proud.. He knew that even full mature men sometimes died to single ones.. let alone a pack of 6 feral Cougars.. 5 Male, and 1 female.  His body had no attraction.. Yet.. But the Cougar&#39;s could not say the same.. They saw a vulnerable treat to convert.. The 5 males showcasing taboo throbbing erection under each of their legs.. Twitching.. Red.. And unapologetically primally animalistic with unapologetic nudity.. their balls swung like little clackers as their sheathes, unbidden by clothes or human constructs made the human whimper as they saw the rising cocks.. Oh no.. What was going on? . Charles&#39;s mind helplessly envisions himself defending against them, reasserting his male and straight humanity.. He has no desire to be on the other end.. Yet.. But then while they close in.. Their lapping tongues and throbbing cocks caring little for their target&#39;s preference.. Their claws scratching at the earth, leaving dusty tracks behind.. Their cocks getting closer.. Twitching.. Throbbing.. Dripping.. And... Suddenly.. Charles gasps a breath... He&#39;s not into this at all he tells himself.. They&#39;re just forcing their way onto him... And yet.. <br />
<br />
Charles flinches away from the memory, and takes a few deep breaths before continuing. His face turns bright red!<br />
<br />
 &quot;ANTHONY! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS STUPID QUESTION!?&quot; Charles shouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. i was just trying to see how long you&#39;d stick around if someone ripped your asshole open! What if it wasn&#39;t even human, what if you weren&#39;t even trying to get it.. What if a creature just decided to have it&#39;s way with you.. And you weren&#39;t even trying to do anything. In your mind you know it&#39;s wrong.. But your body&#39;s instincts are just the weak part.. Even though your mind is strong, and can&#39;t resist, your body is instinctual.. Fighting against a base lust that you know is nothing more than inhuman.. the opposite of a refined mind.. The craving to be nothing more than a simpler minded beast.. With no worries.. With instincts to override that worried brain.. No urges of taxes, responsibilities, 70 hour grinders as a anthro.. no.. You&#39;d just be on the ground.. Being fucked.. like a animal.. With no more worries than a animal.. No worries about the future.. Just the now.... And yet.. Still wanting more than just Sex to crave a instinct.. But a soft.. Warm pelt to care of you after, a simpler life, where you only needed to hunt, could run in a wild body, and a mate who could care for you without the worries of life&quot; Anthony replied, his voice creeping in.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHH.. FUCKING DICKWIT!!!!!! WHAT THE JESUS CHRIST AM I GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT 15 MINUTES IF I HAVE TO BE TAKEN DOWN BY ONE OF THESE..&quot; Charles is moaning and screaming.. But something seems wrong!<br />
<br />
{Inside Charles&#39;s mind.. The visions of the Cougars are becoming stronger and starting to feel more real.. He&#39;s driving the car and keeping his eyes on the road in the physical world.. But suddenly all the descriptions start making him moan subconsciously.. it starts to feel like their are ghost paws all over him.. rubbing at him.. Tongues lapping at his sex. He feels them slowly moving inwards, gently nibbling at his anus.. It starts to feel more real than ever before.. The images seem to be getting stronger.. The warm lips of a cougar sliding across his sex.. Feeling the hot breath of a cougar down his throat.. Feeling a heavy tongue slide across his skin.. He moans again.. He can feel himself getting closer and closer to orgasm..</p>
