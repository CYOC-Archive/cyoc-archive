<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While giving yourself some time to think, you look around and notices that the decision is not that easy as you thought it would be. You see two kids, a boy and a girl, not older than maybe eight or nine, playing with the garden sprinkler. Both kids were naked, at first the thought of how wrong it was of their parents to let their kids play in the garden in the nude all by themselves comes to your mind, but then you realize that the hedge surrounding the garden is pretty high and thick, so no passersby would notice the naked children.<br />
<br />
In a second, much larger garden, you notice a group of four teenage boys between the ages of 16 and 18, riding their skateboards in the large and empty pool. The thought of having one of the boys become water to fill the pool, while one other boy becomes an inflatable animal float or cause his body parts to become various types of pool toys and the other two boys become beach or pool chairs seems to feel exciting.<br />
<br />
The sound of barking draws your attention to a third garden, where a man is playing fetch with his Labrador Retriever. You know the neighbour well, he loves his dog Max over everything else, at sometimes you get the feeling that the man loves his dog more than his wife. If that is the case, why not give him what he wants, by transforming him into Max&#39;s bitch?<br />
<br />
Your ears twitch as you hear the squeaking of wheels, when you turn your head you spot the mailman, pushing his cart filled with the daily mail. You remember that some new folks have moved in to the house down the road a couple weeks ago. They still are settling in and have not seem to be able to get themselves a mailbox, it would be wrong for the mailman to just dump the mail on the ground or porch, someone might steal the mail. The thought of having the mailman become a mailbox, until the new family would get a mailbox of their own, pops into your mind, not thinking about the consequences. When the new neighbours notice the mailbox, they probably won&#39;t consider buying a mailbox.<br />
<br />
You notice your tiny head start to hurt from all the thinking, when you smell something, you sniff the air, causing your tiny black nose to twitch. Turning your head you spot your neighbour Charles in his back yard in front of his coal grill. Your mouth starts to water when the image of a nice juicy steak pops into your mind, but you notice something which causes you to tilt your head: Charles does not seem to have grill tongs and uses his hands to turn over the meat and veggies on the grill.<br />
<br />
You then hear giggling and turn your head, noticing two women sunbathing on the lawn of a house, their skin a dark brown color, you can&#39;t help but give a Raccoon smirk and chuckle as you think that, if they&#39;d stay in the sun much longer, that they&#39;d soon look like dried fish. You don&#39;t notice as you lick your lips, your Raccoon part seems to crave for a nice juicy Koi.<br />
<br />
You then feel a something poke your side, causing you to let out a squeak and turn around, you find yourself staring into Keith&#39;s grinning Raccoon face. “Hurry up and decide,” he chitters, “we don&#39;t have all day.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah,” you say, you even pout a little, which makes you look even more cuter, “it is not an easy decision.”<br />
<br />
Keith chuckles, “poor wittwe waccoon,” he teases, causing you to give him the “evil eye”. Keith laughs, “oh come on, Jared,” he says, “just tell me who we should test the keys on.”<br />
<br />
You let out a sigh and turn around to look once again at the options, running the ideas which you got for each “test subject” through your tiny mind once again. You finally manage to decide, you turn back to Keith and say, “there are two kids playing with the sprinkler. They seem to love water a lot.”<br />
<br />
Keith nods, “I can tell,” he says, “so what should we do?”<br />
<br />
You point a tiny clawed finger to a spot in the garden, “see those two holes in the flowerbed,” Keith nods, “their mom seems to want to plant some new flowers, but it seems that she can&#39;t find the plants she bought, or she misplaced them.” You turn to face your friend, a smirk on your face, “what if the plants or flowers, which she had bought, would suddenly appear by the two holes?”<br />
<br />
Keith tilts his head, trying to understand your point, he then too smirks, “hehe... that sounds like fun, I can&#39;t wait to see her confused expression, when her “lost plants” suddenly are right there where they need to be,” he says, “what kind of plants or flowers should they become?”<br />
<br />
“Well, the boy would make a nice sunflower, while the girl becomes a rose bush with pink roses.”<br />
<br />
Keith grins, “I love that idea,” he says, “let&#39;s go nearer so that they are in range of the keys, we can hide in the thick bushes.”<br />
<br />
You nod and both of you scurry down the tree and hurry over to the garden where the kids are playing in. Both of you hide under a thick bush, Keith then aims the key at the two children and presses down on the button.<br />
<br />
You watch as two beams of light shoot out the keys and one beam hits the boy in the back, while the second beam hits the girl in her tummy.<br />
<br />
The kids don&#39;t seem to notice as they continue to play and jump through the water, you turn to Keith and are about to say that it does not seem to work, when Keith hushes you by pointing and whispering, “look.”<br />
<br />
You turn back to look at the kids, they stopped playing and are now each standing in front of a freshly dug hole. The kids both just stare blankly in front of them, you then notice that the girl&#39;s hair has changed color, from black to green, and look more like leaves. You watch in amazement as the girl starts to shrink, her arms and legs starting to become thinner, and becoming brown as the skin hardens into bark. Her feet merge together and expand outward, before starting to move upwards, taking the shape of a pot as they turn black and soil fills the pot. The girl&#39;s legs then begin to merge together while her arms shrink and her fingers lengthen into branches. Her face vanishes as her head suddenly seems to split into multiple small branches, soon a rose bush with beautiful pink roses is standing in the spot where a human girl stood moments ago.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” both you and Keith say.<br />
<br />
“That looked kinda creepy,” you add, Keith nods.<br />
<br />
Now it is the boy&#39;s turn, his transformation is more subtle, first his face and head start to flatten, while his face turns orange and becoming, what later will become the black yummy sunflower seeds. His blond hair takes on a yellow color as it turns into the petals, his whole body slims and turns into the green stalk, while his feet, like his sister&#39;s become a black plastic throw-away flower pot filled with soil. His arms shrink and merge with his hands as they too turn green, becoming the leaves as a few more leaves sprout from his body. Finally, the kids have vanished and two beautiful plants are standing in front of the freshly dug holes, ready to be planted.<br />
<br />
You look at Keith, “well, that was fun,” you say, “how long will they stay plants? And what should we do next?”</p>
