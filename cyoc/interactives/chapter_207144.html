<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you woke up, you were surrounded by nurses and quite a few doctors. &quot;Did... did it work?&quot; You asked, hazily. &quot;Oh, the operation isn&#39;t an issue, we got that one down to a T. Your father has even been awake for a while. He&#39;s already looking himself over in the mirror, trying to take it all in. Guess the body he&#39;s now in had an easier time metabolizing the drug that kept you under.&quot; One of the doctors said. <br />
<br />
After a barrage of questions about how you felt, poking you all over and explaining how the regular check ups would work, they left you alone. To &quot;Explore&quot; as they said. Told you that they had a huge mirror in the bathroom, if you wanted to look at yourself. The faster you started to grasp that you were truly someone else for the year, the better. You felt a bit weird about it. Knowing that your own father would stare back at you. But you did as they said. You entered the bathroom and as you saw yourself in the mirror, you started to laugh. Your father was indeed looking back at you. You were laughing because how absurd it felt. Like it was all a dream. But you knew it wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Your father, David, was slightly shorter than you were. He was also fatter and his hair a dark brown with grey in it, rather than your former blond. The blond hair, you got from your mother. But he still had the same blue eyes you did.  He was only 50 years of age, so all least you weren&#39;t some old man. Just a middle aged man... In a way, it was like looking at a older version of yourself, so you guessed that would make things a bit easier, with seeing yourself in the mirror at least. You had up to now still felt a bit woozy from being down under for god knows how long. But as you and your body started to wake up, you noticed something you did not expect. The gown you had been wearing was now sporting a slight tent. You were erect! This part was not something you felt all that good about, you realized. You would have to look and touch your father&#39;s penis for the coming year. Would be hard not to, imagine trying to aim at the toilet? Hell, imagine the smell if you didn&#39;t clean yourself down there for a year? You&#39;d be attracting vultures looking for a dead animal. Had your father had the same problem when he woke up? A thought you tried to dismiss. You didn&#39;t want to think about your dad looking at your erect penis. Although it was inevitable. For both of you. Morning wood would make sure of that.<br />
<br />
So, maybe jumping into the deep end was the best way to deal with this? You decided to get out of the gown. Your father&#39;s naked body was a lot hairier than yours. You decided to look further down. There it was. Your penis for the coming year. Your father&#39;s former dick. Your father kept himself surprisingly clean shaved down there. Why not shave the chest while he was at it, you thought. Your new dick was quite a lot smaller than your old one. Of course, you had been hung. You measured yourself once, sporting a good 9 inches erect. Your new penis was probably something like 6 inches. Wait! Why were you comparing dick sizes with your own father? You felt yourself get a bit nauseas. What made it worse was that your father had probably realized he was hung now. You wouldn&#39;t have to wonder for too long, it turned out. A knock on the door was heard and you put back your gown. Your erection had started to die down, so the tent wasn&#39;t as obvious. <br />
<br />
The person on the other side of the door was you. Your body, that is. &quot;Hi dad&quot; You said. &quot;Hi John... How&#39;s it hanging?&quot; He asked. But before you had time to answer, Your father said &quot;Never knew you were so... much bigger than me&quot;. You gave a weak smile. He knew and he had already compared them in his head as well.  &quot;So, how does it feel?&quot; He asked, but yet again, he interrupted you as you were about to answer. &quot;It feels weird, being young again. So full of energy, you know?&quot; he said. Clearly not going to let you speak. This kept going for probably 5 minutes. He&#39;d ask you a question, then interrupt you and answer it himself instead. &quot;You know, this is going to be quite exciting, isn&#39;t it? Being someone else, being young? Being... hung?&quot; He said, clearly talking to himself at this point. You didn&#39;t want to know what he was thinking about but couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit uneasy. He seemed very excited about the fact he was now in your body. Any doubt he had prior was now blown away, utterly and completely.<br />
<br />
You were saved by the bell as the doctors came into your room. Your mother was here and you were apparently ready to be released. Your father would be sent away to live alone and you would be sent away to live with your mother. Before you knew it, you were dressed in your father&#39;s clothes and in a car on your way to your temporary home. Your mother next to you. It was an incredibly awkward trip. You usually didn&#39;t have a problem talking with your mother - you actually got along quite well, you thought. But right now, you only kept looking over at the other person as if to say something. But having no clue what to say. Eventually your mother, May, broke the silence. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a weird year, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She said. You smiled and said &quot;Yeah, It is&quot; as you both started laughing. Your mother grew silent again and then said &quot;They told me... why they&#39;re doing it this way. Apparently it is to see if being.... Your own father... will make you... um.... attracted to me?&quot;. You blushed. You hoped they hadn&#39;t told her why. You were also surprised at how your mother had put it. It felt really weird knowing that was part of the reason you were to live with your mother. After that, the both of you sat in silence the rest of the way, clearly embarrassed the both of you.</p>
