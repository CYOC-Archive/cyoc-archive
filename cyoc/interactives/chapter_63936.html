<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last day of the trials had arrived to poor Matt, the House. As usual Matt woke up before the guards came <br />
to take him, and met Jack on the can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Matt boy, guess what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember your buddy Tony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I found him yesterday and guess what? He is going to be with you today in the House.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he want you to payback his services.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fat chance. If that fucker believes I'm gonna do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don't kill the messenger. I just love to tease you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right ninnies. Matt Surname, come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
On the chamber where all his dreadful transformations took place. A movie started to play again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings,...&quot; began the narrator &quot;...this is your first time in the House. Now the House is actually a way <br />
for you, the inmate, to pay your debt with society and improve yourself. The house is both a school and a <br />
restaurant, and you will attend to classes and waiter the tables. Since you will be working alongside civils a <br />
subliminal command will be engraved in your brain as to protect both customers and yourself. Remember you are <br />
in constant trial and any misdemeanor in this area will most likely end up in Lifetime sentence.&quot;<br />
<br />
The video was actually informative for once, now at least he new that he better avoid any confrontation in <br />
there, not that he actually wanted to create trouble unless they provoke him, at least he was going to have a <br />
little more freedom. The projector disappeared like the last times, and the machine began to function. Matt <br />
was by now used to it, but he found it hard to believe he was about to be transformed again, specially if he <br />
was a bout to meet civilians. But the doubts cleared when he felt that his jaw was closing involuntarily and <br />
his teeth fused together forcing his face to smile. His hair began to grow until it was barely past his <br />
shoulders and taking a white-blond color. Soon his crotch and chest felt funny. His chest began to sprout a <br />
pair of well rounded bobbies, until he got a B-cup. The change of his crotch was a little more unpleasant <br />
since his balls retracted into his body and his skin folded and transformed. By the end s/he was by all uses a <br />
ever-smiling hermaphrodite, a little more on the XX side.<br />
<br />
A guard came to took her/him into the House. This part of the facility looked more like a Luxury hotel than <br />
part of a prison. The guard made her/him walk as he barked the choirs schedule.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, listen Bimbo. You are to report to the kitchen at 08:45 am for your shift in the restaurant. The <br />
customers start to come at 09:30 am, in the mean time you're under the orders of the Ma&icirc;tre d', cleaning <br />
tables, dishes or whatever; at all times in the restaurant you're to wear your provided apron, but only inside <br />
the restaurant. Your shift ends at 02:50 pm and then lunch break until 03:10 pm where you're to report to <br />
class on the second floor, that includes cooking, etiquette, art, tailoring, mechanics and computer basics. <br />
Classes ends at 07:00 pm. Then is back to your cell. Oh and one more thing see those statues.&quot; said pointing <br />
to the numerous marble statues depicting men, women and children naked across the halls. &quot;In this section all <br />
good points are more valuable and all misdeeds are punished harder, try not ending up like decoration.&quot; Matt <br />
would have gasped if not for his clench jaw. Forever trapped in marble were the Lifetimes inmates in the <br />
House.<br />
<br />
Matt was appointed into the kitchen, the apron they made him/her wear only covered the genitals leaving his <br />
breasts and buttocks ready available for the perverted costumers of the restaurant to grope about. Despite the <br />
slight molestation he was subject to the House wasn't nearly as bad as the other areas in Thornback, he <br />
actually enjoyed his classes, up until he was made to model for the rest of the class, apparently a tradition <br />
for newcomers. <br />
<br />
His shift was almost over, when someone grabbed him/her from behind and shove him/her into a broom closet. His  <br />
jaw was already meld to make no noise and his arms were grabbed behind his back. S/he tried to fight back, <br />
turn around a punch whoever was attacking him/her when s/he felt something shoving inside his ass. Violently <br />
thrusting it's way up and down, holding, both his arms with one hand and caressing his breast with other.<br />
<br />
A guard was taking advantage of him/her, was his thought, the man clenching his half-formed genitals, all the <br />
way, the subject doesn't even making a sound. When it felt something on his back, a pair of naked breasts. It <br />
wasn't a guard it was an inmate, the attack continued until a blow of semen shove up Matt's ass. He had been <br />
raped, not sooner that had ended when the doors was knock out and several guards came rushing to separate both <br />
hermaphrodites. The situation was obvious and the attacker was beaten while they took Matt to a place where he <br />
could recover. The rest of the classes were canceled for him.<br />
<br />
When his time in the House was up he was lead back to the chamber when he noticed a new statue on the halls, <br />
it was ob a boy, about thirteen, mopey hair and a fig leaf to protect his modesty, when he recognized the <br />
face... it was Tony. He had been made a lifetime inmate in the House. And too soon Matt filled the blanks and <br />
all compassion for him was washed away.<br />
<br />
<br />
That night he cried to sleep much to the annoyance of Jack, his collar was finally retired and tomorrow his <br />
programed sentence will began. It didn't matter where he end up, he knew his time on Thornback would be hell.</p>
