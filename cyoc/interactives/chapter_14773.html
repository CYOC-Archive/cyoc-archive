<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shake the man's hand in a greeting while knowing he plans to doom your future. Your head turns as hearing the delighted whinny of the Lippizzaner stallion as it is turned out to pasture.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a happy one I must say!&quot; remarks Doctor Thule as he continues without a look backward and marches up the marble steps.<br />
<br />
The stallion a one time woman is prancing about as if showing off his vim and vigger. He hasn't yet caught sight or the scent as he is not alone in that pasture. From where you stand the sight of three horses grazing near the center of his pasture are most likely mares.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do continue up to the porch, you can watch the stallion become a stud quite well from up there.&quot; suggests the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Again like climbing a white marble mountain the steps raise you ever higher and as your sure the Doctor thinks he's in Heaven your feeling like its all down to Hell.<br />
<br />
Winded at last you reach the large and long porch which fronts the mansion of this great and rich Doctor. He's all set with two deck chairs a round table as what looks like iced tea and cookies.<br />
<br />
He sits and then you as from the houses front door comes a man looking like the butler from the Adam's family reruns. He gives the Doctor his cel phone and gives you a dirty look.<br />
<br />
One might have ignored that look but it was his pointed ears which made you double take. As he turns to walk back to the house the Doctor spies your interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;They all are you know, all my employees that is...!&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you ask as wondering what he's talking about?<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe in being very careful as any of those who work here might tell all they know or have seen to the media. Therefore I induce a minor amount of the D.N.A Reformation Process drug into their bodies when they come here to work. It's dorment as long as they take one pill a day. Then the changes is kept to soft tissue only like ears, penis, and such. Yet be they foolish and leave without being given authorization the drug will spread its effects making them inside a month whatever type of injection I used. Oh you saw the driver, he's tried to leave after just learning what I do here and the drug began to change him to a very handsome Gazelle. As he came back rather unwillingly I put a stay on his change based on his working here long term as one might say. I think although the drug is still working on him as he often pleasures himself with local deer, goats, and any other Gazelle we do produce.&quot; explains life the Doctor does as you watch a lady turned stallion mount her first.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what of me, am I to be a Gazelle or fish or what?&quot; said boldly as your question gets a squinting eye from the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will talk about it since you discover the process in a odd sort of way. I feel no anger toward you or even the Wells and since I don't the choice will be yours to make. Now do have some ice tea nad those nice butter cookies, they are my favorite!&quot; says the Doctor as you reach for the glass of tea.<br />
<br />
Sipping the tea you pick up a cookie which tastes really well flavored as loaded with butter. Munching the third cookie you happen to note Doctor Thule eyeing you with some increased amount of interest.<br />
<br />
A sip more of the brisk flavored tea has you asking, &quot;What ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then you see and things begin to fall into place, Doctor Thule is not eating his favorite cookies, he's not drunk a sip of the tea either? &quot;Its in the cookies or is it the tea?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both actually, as the tea is liquid it prepares the bodies system for the shock of a small amount of regenerative chemical. It is the cookies which has the prime ingredients that begin the body to effect those soft tissue changes I mentioned earlier. As no final set pattern is inserted your mutation should be minor. This will keep you here just like those employees and also you have maybe a week to look around and consider which is a worthy form and lifestyle.&quot; explains the Doc as your forth cookie is retuned to the plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner is served, Doctor!&quot; says the Butler in his very low toned voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes do come we are having some of my real favorites, Beefalo Steak for dinner. It is the cross of an Aberdeen Angus with an American Bison making the best of meat.&quot; says Doctor as he rushes past you to enter the grand mansion and feast some subject of his work.<br />
<br />
A quick look back and now the stallion is mounted over the rump of his second mare. One can see his pelvic thrusts, the force he is enjoying and maybe his mare remembers who she was too?<br />
<br />
Dinner, a feast of all kinds of food is set before the two of you as Doctor gorges his loving meat down slice after juicy slice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your not enjoying the steak!&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Actually your thoughts are on who you might be eating and not that reality of it being now a slab of meat cooked.<br />
<br />
Looking at the Doctor as tears of fears and disgust well up in eyes one blurts out the passioned feelings. &quot;Who was he, the steak, the Beefalo, who was he before he matured to slaughter?&quot; you bluntly ask the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Doctor Thule puts down his fork and knife, removes his napkin from under his third chin, moves his chair back from the table and taking a deep breath he sighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now in being here one must detach the thoughts of who the animals were as for them their lives and memories are soon erased by intincts and sexual drives.&quot; The Doctor gets up and walks over to stand by the fireplace.<br />
<br />
There are very many who we accept in and the names mean nothing to me as I don't want to know who they were but that their transformation is suited to my needs. If I got all emotional and wrapped up in those peoples lives I might never do what has to be done! Believe me when I say the only ones who are greeted as you be those who come here willingly, or in your case as part of keeping this place secure. So as you are soon to be as one of my animals it would please me that you accept what is to be or I can be rather forceful too.&quot; warns the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what of Mister Jefferys?&quot; you change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jefferys, Jefferys, oh you mean that nice young man you sat next to on the plane! He is a volunteer, young fool, idealistic to the grim! He has the idea we are to make him into an Angora Buck bunny. As well i might but one so shrunken down don't often live through the process. He will be preped as you are now, his memory needs be moved from the brain's outer lobes and placed on a small compact computer memory chip. I had a plan to do as he was told but with a rush order my plans have to bend with the flow of orders. Now we need a male Bulldog of fair size and with the mental aspects of a Canine Einstein. A protector of a disabled child will he be but keeping his memory only adjusted so language is understood while to obey as a good Dog. His will, the human rational will be limited. His body should have the same sensations of a Bulldog and with added patterns of canine instinst written into the chip he will make a fine stud too. The chip inserted into the smaller brain of a dog is increased by the compressed memory on the chip giving us our Canine Einstein. As he enters his new life the only human thrills he would still enjoy is companionship, that is what was ordered.&quot; explains all does the Doctor of Mister jeffery and his new life ahead.</p>
