<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, Mark had begun his workout at the gym. Now that he had the Chronivac, he didn&#39;t actually need to lift weights anymore. Honestly, he was there just to show off his new bod, check out the other guys, and see how many stares he&#39;d get. Which was plenty, so far. In his short gym shorts and tight tank top, he looked like the picture of sexy masculinity. Mark was doing squats right now, using the most weight he&#39;d ever used before. He squatted deep and low, showing off his perfectly round muscular ass. As he squatted, the bands of his jockstrap could clearly be seen straining against the fabric of his gym shorts. With his godly 6 foot 5 frame, enormous bulge, and furry body, Mark exuded confidence and he smirked at all the second glances he was getting from both men and women.<br />
<br />
Mark headed over to the free weights. His hairy chest was matted with sweat and his beard was dripping as well. Suddenly, he felt a tingle. He was about to grab some weights when someone commented, &quot;Hey bro, nice ink!&quot; It was another gym goer. Mark was confused, &quot;Huh?&quot; he asked. Mark didn&#39;t have tattoos...<br />
But when he looked up at the mirror, his mouth opened in surprise. Both of his arms were covered in full sleeves, colorful designs that snaked their way from his shoulders down to his wrists. &quot;What the---&quot; Mark muttered, running his hands over his biceps and forearms to make sure the tattoos were really there. &quot;Aiden was using the Chronivac!&quot; he realized suddenly.<br />
<br />
Mark grew hot with panic. What other changes would Aiden make? He looked around and made his way to the men&#39;s locker room as quickly and calmly as he could. Mark had just made it to the bathroom mirror when the next wave of changes took place. He stared at his new reflection. Mark was older! There were new wrinkles and care lines in his face. Whereas before he appeared to be in his thirties, he was now clearly in his forties. His hairstyle had remained the same, a short, almost buzzcut style. But now his dark hair had become salt and pepper. Gone also was his full beard. Instead, his upper lip was completely covered by a dense, bushy moustache. It was still mostly dark but was also peppered with silver hairs. Mark felt his cheeks and chin. The rest of his face sported a course stubble that was grayer on his chin. It was like the beginnings of a beard, maybe a week&#39;s growth at least, but shaved short so that his moustache was clearly the star of the show. Mark admitted that it looked pretty hot. He leaned forwards and wiggled his upper lip, causing his moustache to dance like a fuzzy caterpillar.<br />
<br />
He looked down. Mark&#39;s body was still huge and muscular, with boulder-like shoulders and biceps covered with hair. But now the stubble from his neck connected with the silvery tufts of chest hair that spilled over the neck of his tank top. Mark yanked the shirt up and off. He could see that his build was mostly unchanged, most the body hair that covered his stomache and pecs was still dark, but gray hairs were creeping in, especially at the top of his chest and shoulders. He still had a muscle gut, one where the impression of abs could just be seen under a thick treasure trail when he flexed. He turned a bit, trying to get a look at his back. It was hairy, wide and V-shaped still, but now his full sleeve tattoos covered his shoulder blades. Mark turned back around. His pecs looked massive and heavy. His areolas looked really big, but it was hard to notice under his furry pelt. The nipples though, were still prominent and poked out from his chest. Mark felt a sudden tingle, and two heavy steel rings threaded themselves through his nipples. He had piercings! Mark reached up to the feel the big rings as they dangled. They were definitely going to be visible through his clothes and if anything, they made his nipples stand out even more! He tugged on one of the rings gently, sending a jolt of pleasure through his body and down to his cock.<br />
<br />
His cock! Mark pulled the waistband of his jock forward and sighed in relief. The boys were all still intact. His balls were like fuzzy lemons hanging under his thick, veiny dick, which was still massive but now circumcized. Gone was his foreskin, and now visible was the plump, reddish-purple mushroom head of his penis. All surrounded by a thick bush. His cock twitched and began to lengthen. Mark was obviously a bit excited by these changes. He let the waistband snap closed and quickly tried to think of something else. Otherwise, his cock would quickly snake its way out of the pouch of his jock and down the leg of his gym shorts. Mark was a little impressed with Aiden&#39;s preferences. He was looking like a true muscle Daddy now!</p>
