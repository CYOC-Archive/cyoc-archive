<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Axel whined, tucking his tail between his legs as he sat down into his seat. His ears flopped over as Jeremy takes the seat to his right, and Austin sat to his left. Try as he might, Axel&#39;s thick rod bobbed with need, poking out several inches from below his desk, the red rocket easily seen by the entire class. He looked up to see the disapproving glare of his father, his own cock lazily out of its sheathe at half-chub.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Huff began his lesson, Axel was subjected to the torment of his bullies. Jeremy pretended to pass a note to Austin on the other side of the young wolf. He leaned forward and purposefully smacked the back of his hand against the wolf&#39;s shaft, eliciting a low yelp from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, watch it, freak,&quot; Jeremy grunted, flicking the strand of pre-seed that adhered to his hand into Axel&#39;s face. As if by instinct, the wolf brought out his tongue and lapped the liquid off his snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, that&#39;s fuckin&#39; gross, Axe-hole,&quot; Austin guffawed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sick,&quot; Jeremy added with disgust. All Axel could do was whine and lower himself into his seat. He hunched over and buried his head in his paws.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Axel&#39;s heightened hearing picked up a peculiar sound. He looked up to see his dad picking on one of the girls seated in the front row, berating her on how stupid she must be to not know about the Krebs cycle. But that wasn&#39;t what he was hearing. No, it almost sounded like fabric stretching.<br />
<br />
His eyes went wide as he looked over to his side to see Jeremy glaring at him, his pupils like slits. A low rumble emanates from the bully&#39;s mouth as his teeth sharpen. Axel gulps as he turns away, only to be greeted with Austin looking the same. The other bully&#39;s chest bursted out of his letter jacket, mounds of muscle packing onto his frame, the sleeves of the jacket straining as they almost failed to contain Austin&#39;s new mass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Axe,&quot; a deep rumble came from behind. Axel gulped and slowly turned around. He whimpered as he heard Jeremy&#39;s sleeves rip, his eyes going wide as tufts of white fur busted out along his biceps. He looked past the transforming jock&#39;s thick chest to watch as Jeremy&#39;s frame widened as his height matched his own. The jock licked his lips, his new fangs glinting in the afternoon light as a faint snapping of bone rang through the air; his face contorted as his mouth and nose reconfigured into a snout. Fur burst out from Jeremy&#39;s skin as his change was complete. Axel was looking at a monstrously built white wolf. He tried not to glance down, but it was impossible not to see Jeremy&#39;s large, swollen member also bobbing underneath his desk.<br />
<br />
He looked to his other side to see another buff reddish-brown wolf sitting where Austin was. While he wasn&#39;t nearly as large as Jeremy was, he was impressive in his own right. This one was actively stroking himself underneath his desk. He glared back at Axel, a wolfish grin plastered on his handsome muzzle.<br />
<br />
Axel felt his heartbeat quicken, a tense fear creeping up his chest. Oh God, what were his bullies going to do to him now?! As if on cue, he heard a deep growl coming from his right. The screech of rubber on linoleum rang through the air as Jeremy&#39;s immense bulk dragged his chair and desk along the floor as he stood. Axel looked around in a panic, but it seemed the rest of the class barely paid it any attention.<br />
<br />
The young wolf whined as he watched the hulking white canine literally pick up the chair and desk, complete with the student, in front of his own and shoved it aside. A bead of sweat ran down Axel&#39;s temple as Jeremy glared at him, the big jock getting onto his knees as he took Axel&#39;s huge shaft into his paws.<br />
<br />
Axel huffed lowly. As rough as Jeremy looked, rugged and masculine, a paragon of wolf-kind, his paws were nice and soft. Axel couldn&#39;t help but shift about, the pleasure so intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, stop squirming, Axe,&quot; Jeremy growled as he leaned down and took a cursory lick at the pointed tip of Axel&#39;s cock, the white wolf greedily slurping up the wave of pre-seed he got to jettison out of the cockhead. The huge jock glared up into Axel&#39;s eyes. &quot;Can&#39;t believe a dork like you is our Alpha,&quot; the white wolf snarled before stroking at the darker wolf&#39;s red length. &quot;If I was as hung as you, I&#39;d be commanding my Betas around to suck my dick,&quot; he hissed under his voice before he went down on Axel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, show some initiative, brah,&quot; Austin chuckled. The red wolf leaned over and pinched at Axel&#39;s nipple, causing the young pup to yowl in delight. &quot;Hell yeah, look at that monster jump in yer mouth, Jeremy!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true, as monstrously hung as the white and red wolf were, both easily members of the double-digit club, Axel was at least half again as large, in both length and girth, as the two of them! Jeremy almost choked as a flood of blood shot through Axel&#39;s dick, the girth temporarily growing so much that it blocked off the white wolf&#39;s airway.<br />
<br />
Axel&#39;s tongue lolled out as Jeremy sucked him off, the young wolf even getting into a rhythm as he rocked in his desk before he tensed up. Axel&#39;s howl thundered through the room, Austin joining in. Axel could even hear what sounded like a couple of howls coming all the way from the gymnasium join too. As his orgasm ripped through him, Axel reached over the desk and grabbed at Jeremy&#39;s head behind the ears and roughly shoved his fellow wolf down further up his cock. Jeremy didn&#39;t protest, in fact, it seemed like he liked it. The white wolf unleashed his own load all over Axel&#39;s hindpaws as he ravenously slurped up Axel&#39;s loads.<br />
<br />
A satisfying pop rang through the air as Jeremy pulled off of Axel&#39;s cock, a few lazy spurts sputtered out onto his muzzle, and some even oozed out of Jeremy&#39;s nostrils. The white wolf growled as he brushed past another student who was clearly engrossed in the public display of lupine bonding.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you lookin&#39; at, human? We&#39;re just doing pack business. Don&#39;t get any ideas,&quot; Jeremy snorted, giving the student a hard shove, sending their seat a good foot away. &quot;Besides, you wouldn&#39;t survive Axel&#39;s load. Unlike a beast like me!&quot; To emphasize his point, as the white behemoth sat down, his own chair groaning under his enhanced weight, he brought an arm up and gave it a good flex. The rest of the sleeve disintegrated across his huge bicep. &quot;Thanks for your protein, sir, gonna put it to good use in the weight room,&quot; Jeremy snickered, bouncing his pecs playfully. To Axel&#39;s surprise, Jeremy leaned over and gave him a lick on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I get dibs on you next, Axe,&quot; Austin called out, his tail audibly swishing behind him. The red wolf took Axel&#39;s chin in his paw and turned it to him, the handsome red canine giving him a knee-melting wink.<br />
<br />
As if to save him the embarrassment, the bell rang, signaling the end of the period. Thankfully, properly spent, Axel&#39;s dick had finally started to retreat into his sheathe. With a sigh of relief, the young wolf picked up his things and bolted out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re goin&#39;, Axe-hole?&quot; Jeremy snarled from behind him, his massive paw shot out the door and stopped the &#39;Alpha&#39; wolf in his tracks. Axel gulped as he watched the huge white wolf squeeze his way out of the door, his devilish grin joined by Austin&#39;s from behind.</p>
