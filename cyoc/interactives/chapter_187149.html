<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wearing higher heels actually had its benefits. Henry was taller again, he had not fully regained his pre-honeymoon height but the 3 extra inches must have made him 5’11, halfway there! The negatives out weighed that positive though, he had stumbled and twisted his ankle even before leaving the suite, however it seemed no permanent damage was done. <br />
<br />
He felt he had to hurry and find Alicia, so had no time to do anything else but open the door and leave the suite making sure he had his room key in the handbag now hanging from his shoulder. Henry walked carefully down the carpeted corridor. He made sure with each step that he had firm contact with the ground before lifting his back leg. Progress was slow but steady.<br />
<br />
In her note Alicia had said she was ‘Heading back to the bar’ Henry assumed she meant the bar overlooking the golf-course they had eaten at, not the much closer pool bar. He resisted the temptation to visit the pool bar on the way, just to see whether his assumption was wrong, that would take precious minutes at the speed he was walking, that he could not afford. <br />
<br />
Henry was walking more competently by the time he came to the reception area. But now he was no longer alone. There were a numerous people with suitcases apparently waiting for service. Henry assumed they must be checking in. Although he was concentrating on every step he could not help but feel the eyes looking at him and overheard the comment. “Hooly Dooly! We are in heaven, check it out!” Henry paused. And slowly turned around. The voice had come from a group of 3 men in their early 20’s. Remembering Alicia’s advice, he gave a smile at the men, and noticed one of them looking very sheepish, before turning and continuing in the direction of the bar. He couldn’t help but take it as a compliment when he heard a different voice say “Out of your league man. Out of your league” Henry walked on praying that he wouldn’t stumble.<br />
<br />
He managed to get to the bar, by now walking much more competently, He had only stumbled once between reception and the bar entrance and fortunately no-one else was around to notice. He had become aware of how his bum wiggled with each step, was that due to the heels somehow?<br />
<br />
Henry entered the bar and was relieved to immediately spot Alicia, very grateful that his search was over. She was in her ‘Look at me’ brown dress seated on a lounge chair by a table. 3 men are also seated around that table, all in individual lounge chairs. Henry immediately recognised Alex as one of them and had to tell himself ‘Don’t be jealous. Alicia loves you, she just enjoys attention’<br />
<br />
Alicia must have noticed Henry walk in. She waved him over. Henry gritted his teeth and walked across, hoping he won’t stumble. The three men with Alicia as well as everyone else in the bar seem to be watching him intently. Remembering he is meant to be Alicia’s mute sister, all Henry can do is smile at his admirers as he concentrated on each step.<br />
<br />
The men all stand up as he approaches. Alicia says “Gentlemen, meet my sister Rachel who I was telling you about. Rachel this is Terry and Richard and you already know Alex” All Henry could do was smile, &#39;Rachel&#39; was meant to be mute.<br />
<br />
“Lovely to meet you Rachel. Take this seat” said the man Alicia had just introduced as Richard “I’ll fetch another seat for myself”<br />
<br />
“Would you like a drink Rachel?” asked Alex. “Perhaps a Whiskey? Or would you like a cocktail?” Henry’s eyes noticed an almost empty yellow drink on the table nearest to Alicia. The men appeared to each have beers. <br />
<br />
Henry was in the process of sitting down on the seat Richard had offered him. He had to concentrate on his footwork as he twisted to sit down. He hoped he was not making a fool of himself. Once in place he mimicked the way Alicia had crossed her long legs.<br />
<br />
Alicia answered Alex’s question on behalf of Henry. “I’m sure Rachel would love a Mai Tai” All Henry could do was smile. <br />
<br />
“Let me get that, it’s my shout” said Terry. “Everyone else ready for another round?”<br />
<br />
Richard returned with another chair which he positioned it beside Henry then sat on it. He turned to Henry and spoke. “I heard you two are budding golfers. You should come across and play a round at my course”<br />
<br />
Henry had to stay silent. He was supposed to be a mute female. He smiled. Once more Alicia answered for him “Rachel is only here until Saturday morning” <br />
<br />
“That gives you two days. It’s a lovely course. The club is up in the mountains. Very different to here. We have just re-opened last weekend after expanding to 18 holes, designed by Greg Norman”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’ve been meaning to go there and check out the finished product. Are you totally up and running now?” said Alex who was listening in.<br />
<br />
“Yep. We have the official opening Saturday week. You should be getting an invitation. But the course is actually playable now. We are just completing the pro-shop renovations” <br />
<br />
“I was going to take the ladies up to Hoomaluhia tomorrow afternoon. Any chance we could stop by?”<br />
<br />
Just then Terry returned with a tray of drinks. An orange drink with cherry’s, pineapple and lime was placed in front of him. Alicia was given an identical drink.<br />
<br />
“You can more than stop by. How long have you got?”<br />
<br />
“We were meeting here for lunch at 1. Then..” he looked at Alicia for confirmation “All afternoon … and possibly the evening. Do you have anything else on your agenda tomorrow Alicia?”<br />
<br />
“No just lunch and the promise of visiting some spots that only the locals know about”<br />
<br />
“Well drop in. I’m owed time. We could have a round. If you had the time stay for dinner. We have just opened a new restaurant at the resort. I haven’t tried it yet. How about you Terry? Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?”<br />
<br />
“Count me out. Some of us have to work for a living, not just bash little white balls around”<br />
<br />
“What do you think Alex? Maybe a round of alternate?”<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” asked Alicia, being ignorant of the golf jargon.<br />
<br />
“We play in teams. Taking it in turns to take the stroke. I could play with you and Richard and Rachel would team up”<br />
<br />
Henry was in the process of sipping his cocktail. <br />
<br />
Alicia once more answered on behalf of Henry “Sounds wonderful”</p>
