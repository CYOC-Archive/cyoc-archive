<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You followed Rose's mom to the library. Once inside she checks to see if any one is there then closes and locks the door. She turns to Corrine and asks &quot;What did you need to tell us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already started on reversing Lilly's curse&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you have started reversing the curse?&quot; Rose asked. &quot;You just found out about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've known about it for a couple of years&quot; Corrine said. &quot;You don't remember it since I blocked that memory from your minds for now so as not to scare Lilly more than she already is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Rose's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should sit down before I tell you&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
You sit down in a comfy leather chair and wait for Corrine to continue. After a few moments where she seemed to be gathering her thoughts she said &quot;Your memories will return as I tell you this. At least the two of you will regain your memories. I'm not sure about Lilly though. I hope she will regain her memories but she may not. First off you should know that I was the one who put the spell on the shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You cursed my daughter!&quot; Rose's mom said outraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not curse her&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why couldn't we get them off?&quot; Rose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They needed to stay on until Lilly was returned to her body&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I haven't been returned to my body&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you have, you just don't know it yet&quot; Corrine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to know that myself&quot; Rose's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilly was cursed two years ago&quot; Corrine said. &quot;She had picked out a costume for the school costume party. She thought it would be fun going as an adult man. Unfortunately the costume she picked was cursed. When she was done transforming she disappeared. I have been searching for her since then. I finally found her in an alternate reality a couple days ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't think to tell me this!&quot; Rose's mom said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't sure if I could get her back here and I didn't want to give you false hope&quot; Corrine said. &quot;In retrospect I should have told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on&quot; Rose's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously I was able to bring her back to this reality&quot; Corrine said. &quot;I made the park across from the mall appear in that reality and when Lilly walked into it she was transported back to this reality. I was hoping that she would notice the mall and go in which she did. She then went into the costume store where Rose helped her. I knew that there was a possibility that she wouldn't pick a costume that would start her transformation back to herself so I placed a bag where she would slip on it and pull the necessary costume off it's hanger. After that she would of course need shoes to go with it and I knew which ones Rose would pick out for her. I put an additional spell on those shoes but Rose didn't go right to them. I had to do something so I acted like I was casting a spell and hoped that Lilly would see me. She did and chased me down the isles with the shoes. She lost me and Rose picked out the shoes I knew she would. The spell I had placed on them returned her fully to her original body. Now you know what has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you make us forget that Lilly was cursed two years ago?&quot; Rose's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it best to minimize the trauma to Lilly&quot; Corrine said. &quot;As it was she freaked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Corrine was talking your memories did indeed come back. You remember your life as an adult man. A couple years ago you had woken from a nap with the certain knowledge that something was wrong. You couldn't put your finger on it then and it quickly faded but you never forgot it. Now Corrine's words explain it. You look at her and say &quot;I've regained the memories you blocked but nothing of my life as Lilly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was afraid of this&quot; Corrine said. &quot;The curse is stronger than I thought. At least you have your body back and you're with your family. As long as nothing else happens I should be able to break down the barriers to your memories. It may take some time but I'm confident I can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll start remembering now that I'm back&quot; you said thinking of some amnesia cases where people regained their memories by being in familiar surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be&quot; Corrine said thoughtfully. &quot;The one who cursed you might have seen a flaw in the curse and that's why you were sent to an alternate reality. If you can remember even one tiny little memory I can use that to break down the barriers. Now I need to get ready to change your father back. I think that I might be able to completely reverse it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why's that?&quot; your mom asked in a hopeful voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there may be a flaw in that curse&quot; Corrine said. &quot;Now I think that the reason I've been able to change him every year is because the curse was more or less tailored to Lilly. I've been under the assumption that it was a general curse but now it seems like it was tailored to Lilly. With this I may be able to counter it at last.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great!&quot; your mom said. &quot;Get to it then please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Corrine said and started to leave. Your mom got up and unlocked the library door.<br />
<br />
Your mom then turns to you and says &quot;Go on up to your room. Maybe you'll find something there that will jog your memory. Show her where her room is Rose, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Rose said.<br />
<br />
On the way up to your room Rose said &quot;I noticed that you said 'Mom'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I now know that you are my family&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What changed your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two years ago I woke up from a nap with the certain knowledge that something was wrong. Now I know what was wrong. I just hope that I can regain my memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I.&quot;</p>
