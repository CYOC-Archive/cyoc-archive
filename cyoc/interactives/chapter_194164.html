<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanya heard the sound of feet as someone ran down the hall. Curious to know who it was running about, she peeked out of the bathroom and caught a brief glimpse of a little girl as she tore downstairs. Startled by this, unable to wrap her mind around what she saw, it took her a moment before she realised that her brother had not only turned himself back into a girl, like she’d suggested he do, but had gone a step further and become a little girl, even as she furrowed her brow at the memories she had that conflicted with one another.<br />
<br />
	She could still recall that she had a brother, though that was starting to fade away. She was certain his name was Christopher, that he was fourteen years old, and shared her lover for basketball. Yet, these were being stripped away from, replaced by memories that insisted she actually had a younger sister, Christine, who was eight, and didn’t care one whit about basketball. That she was more interested in dolls, playing dress-up, the cartoons she loved to watch that had talking pastel-coloured horses, among other interests, which all seem contradictory to vague memories that still lingered about Christine at age fourteen, who had none of those interests, but more of those shared by Tanya.<br />
<br />
	“Is this more of reality being altered by the amulet?” the teenage girl asked herself as she stepped back into the bathroom to finish getting ready, but found she couldn’t.<br />
<br />
	Thoughts on the necklace, she wondered what Christine had done with it after her latest transformation. Thinking back to when they’d first encountered the amulet, and the agreement they’d made, she went over whether she’d still be made to keep her end of it as she set her brush down on the sink and exited the bathroom. Slipping quietly down the hall, she stepped into the room that had been her brother’s and stopped.<br />
<br />
	Signs that the magick had already began to change the room could already be seen and Tanya took in the plush that now lay on the bed, the white walls with rainbows, unicorns, and winged horses painted on them, as well as that the wall-to-wall carpet had been replaced by two surface rugs. Certain that if she were to come back later, she see either more changes or that the room would look fully like it belong to a little girl, that the last vestiges of it ever being inhabited by a teenage boy would be fully gone, much like it had transformed to accommodate a girl of fourteen, she stepped closer to the bed, where she saw the Amulet of Zulo still laying. Picking it up, careful not to touch any of her sister’s plush whilst she did so, she toyed with what she should do with it as she turned, left the room and headed for her bedroom.<br />
<br />
	Secretly, she hoped her sister would forget about the necklace. As she shut her bedroom door, Tanya wondered if this was a mean thing. Thinking it didn’t seem mean, “Especially if he is now happy,” she reasoned, she headed toward her closet and took from within a set of clothes she’d bought when the whole mess had started. Mindful to make sure they didn’t touch the Amulet of Zulo, she set the slacks, underwear, and shirt on her bed and wondered what she should do with them and the necklace.<br />
<br />
	On one hand, she thought she should at least honour the agreement she’d originally made. There was a small part of her that felt she should, as well as was curious about what it would be like to be a guy. Yet, for the most part, she was happy as a girl, with the only thing she found she could really do without, at the moment, was her monthlies, the confusion of puberty, and how tiring it could be to sometimes keep up with everything that was expected of being a teenage girl. On the flip side of this, Tanya thought the pact she and Chris had made was no longer valid, as Chris had become Christine, become Christopher again, but then became Christine, but younger.<br />
<br />
	“Does this mean the agreement is now void? Or am I still bound to hold to it?” she asked herself as she looked from the necklace to the clothes and back.<br />
<br />
	Minutes slipped by and Tanya knew her mother would soon be up to see what was keeping her, that she still had to get ready for school, and that she needed the extra time to make herself look presentable for school pictures. A glance at the underwear, a white pair with dinosaurs printed on them, and she wasn’t sure what had possessed her to even purchase something that would fit a nine or ten year old, why she hadn’t bought clothes for a guy her age. Looking at the slacks and shirt, she considered that if she did use the amulet, she could always wear those to school, as they would be nice enough for class pictures.<br />
<br />
	Conflicted about what she should do, Tanya sat down on her bed. Hands clenched firmly around the Amulet of Zulo, she rested them in her lap. Gazing down at the way her chest pushed out in almost a C cup, the tight tank top and the shorts she’d slept in, she thought about bras and panties, which she didn’t have on underneath her sleepwear. After a bit, she found she didn’t really have too big of an issue with wearing panties, as she was a girl, and so long as she didn’t mess them, like she somethings did, accidentally, when on her period, it was okay that she wore them. The bras however, she found she did have a problem with, as they always need to be adjusted how they sat on her shoulders and across her back, the cups never fit quite right, sometimes the underwire was just too uncomfortable, and it could get annoying how they seemed to only force attention to her chest area.<br />
<br />
	“But you have to wear them,” she told herself.<br />
<br />
	Thoughts on what her mother had told her when she’d gotten her breast buds, Tanya huffed, “And they seem to be the only one of two thing guys are interested in looking at. As if there is nothing about me, except my boobs and my butt.”<br />
<br />
	Nettled by this, she glanced over at the clothes and asked her, “If I became a boy, would I act the same way? Or could I find some way to keep myself from such behaviours?”<br />
<br />
	Unable to answer these questions, Tanya stood and marched across her room toward the windows. There, she opened one of them, took out the screen, and toyed with the idea of tossing the necklace out the window and forgetting about it and what it could do. Instead, she turned away from the window and stared at her bed. Her thoughts going back and forth on what she should do, she was startled when she heard a knock on her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
	Irked by the interruption, she called out, “Yeah?” And from the other side of the door, she heard her mother inquire, “Are you up?”&#8232;&#8232;	Again, Tanya said, “Yeah.”<br />
<br />
	“Well, hurry up. If you don’t come down soon, you’re not going to get breakfast,” her mother told her from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
	Glad her mom had at least this time respected her wishes and not come in, Tanya answered, “All right. I’ll be down in a minute,” as she stole silently across her room and placed her ear to the door.<br />
<br />
	Not able to hear anyone on the other side, she opened the door a crack and watched her mother head down the hallway. Closing the door, the teenage girl turned her attention back to the issue she still hadn’t found a resolve to. Thinking on whether it was fair that Chris had become a child again, Tanya tried to recall things of her own childhood, and whether it would be as good if she became a boy, or if she instead used the necklace to regress her age back to when she’d been ten.<br />
<br />
	“Maybe younger,” she considered as she toyed with the idea of letting Chris being the older sibling and she be the younger this time as she glanced at her alarm clock.<br />
<br />
	The time telling her she had less then half an hour before she’d have to head for school, Tanya huffed in exasperation. She knew if she wanted to still get ready, she would just barely have enough time, and heading for her closet, she almost took out a skirt and top to wear. But, at the last second, she stopped and went over instead for her bed. About to reach for the underwear, she told herself, “I shouldn’t,” and she turned away and headed for the closet.<br />
<br />
	Back and forth she went, never seeming to be able to make up her mind. A couple times, she had gone to the window and almost chucked the amulet out, but had always changed her mind. After doing this for the umpteenth time, Tanya stopped in front of her bed and stared down at the articles of clothing. Telling herself, “Shit, or get off the pot,” she crossed her arms across her torso, just below her breasts, and after a moment muttered, “I’ll probably regret this,” even as she felt she wouldn’t and reaching down, she grabbed with her free hand the underwear.<br />
<br />
	With a series of deep breaths, she touched them to the Amulet of Zulo. Sure that the two came in contact with some part of her hand, she shivered when electrical charge went through her. Dropping the underwear on the bed, she looked down and not seeing any change, though she did note her clit suddenly felt even more sensitive than it usually did, she turned away from the bed.<br />
<br />
	Her stride purposeful, she marched across her bedroom. And before she could change her mind, or talk herself out of what she was about to do, Tanya hucked the Amulet of Zulo out the window. Shutting it, she turned away, peered down at herself, moved over to her mirror and looked at her reflection. Still seeing her usual self, unaware that her transformation would be a slow one that would occur in leaps and bounds, she pulled off her tank top, studied her exposed breasts, and didn’t find anything different. Taking off her sleeper shorts, she looked at the thatch of public hair for a moment before she pulled over the chair in front of her vanity, sat down on it, spread her legs and stared at her genitals.<br />
<br />
	Except for being sensitive in a specific area, Tanya found that nothing seemed different at first. Using her fingers to spread her lips, a noise that was part gasp, part moan of pleasure escaping her when she brushed her hand against her clit, and seeing the usual, she pulled her hand away and sat up right.<br />
<br />
	Yet, even as she did this, she found that it didn’t feel proper and after a moment of adjusting how it was she sat, Tanya settled with her legs spread a little ways. Thinking that it was appropriate to sit this way, oblivious that it was the magick already at work on her, she groused, “Probably shan’t even do anything like it did with Chris,” and standing, she pushed the chair back in front of her vanity, scooped up the boy’s underwear and without a thought of what she was doing, pulled them on, as her clit and clit hood merged together and extended outward, whilst inside her body, her ovaries had started to pump out androgens.<br />
<br />
	Unaware of the few changes her body had already undergone, Tanya set about to get ready for her day. Thoughts on what she needed to bring with her to school, she soon forgot the amulet, though would briefly remember it when people started to call her Jonathon, her discovery in a day’s time that she had a penis, but would soon forget it completely as she continued to change from a sixteen year old girl to a boy of ten.<br />
<br />
	Outside, the Amulet of Zulo struck the roof, bounced off, and rolled a bit over the ground before it stopped. Sunshine twinkled off it surface for a moment before, with a brief flare, it was gone.</p>
