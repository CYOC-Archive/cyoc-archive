<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You do make a fine looking poodle, Chad. But you would probably bite, if I gave you the chance. So I&#39;m not going to give you the chance.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s mind was reeling. He was actually becoming a dog. All his memories were shifting from words to pictures and smells.  Karen was talking but the sounds were just sounds. He had to focus to understand her words. His changing snout, shrinking body, and the explosion of smells were totally distracting him from her words. <br />
<br />
The poodle blinked. It tried to bark, but while he was changing, Karen had fitted him with a muzzle and harness. Chad felt control returning to his legs. He tried to bolt to escape, but Karen was holding the lead on his halter tight.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to be anyone&#39;s dog. Even if Karen was a hottie.  He turned his head to look at her. He sniffed. What had he seen in her? Chad was thinking how hot the neighbor&#39;s bitch dog crystal was by comparison.  He now understood why his dog Bounder was always trying to mount her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be difficult, are you?&quot; Karen complained as Chad dug his paws in.<br />
<br />
Karen shrugged. Grunted and picked up her 90lb poodle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget Chad, you&#39;re not big man on campus anymore.  You just went on a crash diet. So I can carry you to your crate.&quot;<br />
<br />
And she did just that. Chad whimpered, and tried to squirm out of her grasp, but he must be 100 lbs lighter than he was before. She unceremoniously thrust him into the waiting animal crate. It wasn&#39;t new. It reeked of Goliath. Damn, that beast was at least Chad&#39;s size now. It&#39;s strong masculine scent intimidated him. <br />
<br />
Chad spun around in the crate as he heard the latch closing.  If Chad the man had a short attention span before, Chad the dog&#39;s short attention span was on steroids. He had totally let himself be distracted by the absent animal&#39;s scent.<br />
<br />
He pressed his maw up against the grating in the door, and whined.<br />
<br />
Karen cackled. Chad leapt back with a start. His new canine hearing was more sensitive to her high pitched laugh.  But he suddenly thought of her as the witch in fairy tales. Was he the prince in the frog prince, only hope to be kissed by a princess to escape his curse? Or was he Hansel in the witch&#39;s cage waiting to be thrust in the oven? There was no Gretel around to rescue him today. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my pretty boy, are you scared?&quot; Karen asked in a cloying tone. Suddenly, she seemed a lot more like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz. She snapped, &quot;Well, you should be. I&#39;ve painstakingly worked out your training regimen with Brad. When he is through with you, you&#39;ll be as obedient as you can be. You&#39;ll be the perfect Prom King to my Prom Queen. You won&#39;t even want to look at over women. And I won&#39;t even have to have you neutered, if Brad trains you as well as he claims he can. &quot;<br />
<br />
Chad whimpered at the word neutered.<br />
<br />
Karen pulled the handle up out of the crate. Chad tumbled into the back wall of the crate as she tilted the travel crate on its back wheels and rolled he naked prisoner out of the field house to her waiting van.<br />
<br />
Karen had the door open, and was awkwardly trying to manhandle the crate containing Chad inside, but it was too heavy and cumbersome for Karen to manage with poodle Chad in the crate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, need some help?&quot; Rick asked. He was on his way back from the practice field to the locker room when he saw Karen in the parking lot struggling with the crate. He made a beeline over like a sweaty shirtless knight rescuing a damsel in distress.<br />
<br />
Chad suddenly thought it humorous that he was the damsel in distress, and the knight errant was helping the witch instead. He made an odd noise, the sound of a muzzled dog trying to bark a laugh. No one noticed.<br />
<br />
Rick had hefted the crate effortlessly into Karen&#39;s van.<br />
<br />
She drove away without securing the crate. So Chad was a nervous wreck from the crate sliding around the back of the van. <br />
<br />
He felt her leave the pavement.  Gravel ratatatattted against the undercarriage of the van. She was driving him up the gravel road to Brad&#39;s kennels.<br />
<br />
She parked. Chad ran frantically in circles trying to escape his tiny prison.<br />
<br />
His brother seemed to have grown into a giant when the van door opened and he loomed over the crate.<br />
<br />
Brutus yapped excitedly and jumped around with his red conical erection unsheathed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whats with your dog?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I guess, Brutus is just excited to have some new meat. My guess is he smells your dog&#39;s fear. Kind of an aphrodisiac for Brutus,&quot;  Brad explained as he leaned into open the crate. He said in a commanding voice, &quot;Heel, Brutus!&quot; The dog instantly stopped yelping, and assumed the position that he had been trained to take.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impressive.  You can do that to Chad?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
Brutus barked when she said Chad&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. Oh, I get it. It&#39;s your dog&#39;s name. My brother Chad was Brutus&#39; original owner, but that dog was always trying to hump Chad, so he gave it to me. Brutus recognized Chad&#39;s name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dog wants to hump your brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brutus wants to hump everything.  He is key to my training program. Brutus establishes himself as alpha dog, then the trainee pup. In your case, Chad has to be broken to assume a subservient place in Brutus&#39; pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Is that your patented secret training method?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of it,&quot; Brad answered. &quot;You&#39;ve already signed all the paperwork and paid the tuition, so you can go. I will go introduce Chad to the pack, and begin his training.&quot; He yanked Chad&#39;s lead. Then he dragged the muzzled dog out of the van, and toward Stalag Brad- hell on earth for dogs.<br />
<br />
Karen harumphed. She hated being dismissed, but then again she thought dog training would be tedious.  So she got in her van and drove off.</p>
