<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Our first night of Lamaze classes and in our private time, Molly and I were soon practicing the techniques that Jennifer Litt had gotten us started on. The technique was intended to help pregnant women prepare to physically give birth, and with twin cubs on the way, Molly and I were intent on making sure that we were ready. Molly practiced the breathing techniques that we were started on, and I did my best to practice the coaching techniques that I was given to help Molly go through labor. And as her pregnancy progressed and her summer due date grew closer and as her womb had grown larger, dealing with the physical process of giving birth, labor, began to dwell on my mind.<br />
<br />
According to everything we had researched on line, or through talks with my mother, Officer Jenkins, or Tabby... basically people who had gone through labor before that we knew, giving birth could take around twenty hours. Somewhat more if it was a new mother's first child or a subsequent child. My folks had even asked Jacki how long she had been in labor for reference. Jacki's answer was that she'd been in the hospital for twenty four hours straight by the time that her third triplet was born. That meant that even if our cubs would be physically smaller then a human newborn, the time taken for Molly to give birth to them would roughly the same as it would take a human woman to give birth to one baby.<br />
<br />
And that made me somewhat nervous over how things would go. Would Molly be okay? Could she take drugs that would dull the pain and not harm our cubs? And of late there was also some concern about whether or not I would even be there for the birth of my cubs. Among mundane tigers, that wasn't an issue. Males tigers for the most part played no role in raising their offspring beyond conception. But as an Animal Person, I did many things that a mundane tiger did not do... or any other mundane animal for that matter. And being there for when Molly would be in labor was a big issue for me.<br />
<br />
And for the moment, that was where the shadow of Grabar and Larceny's wave of burglaries still hung over Molly's and my future. Their crimes had crossed state boundaries and they even crossed into Canada, according to some of the things that Agent Heer had suspected. But because the location their trial would be in Washington State and the fact that it was a Federal case, there was the prospect that I could be called to testify in their trial and calling me away from Columbia Falls when Molly went into labor. I couldn't really get away from that. The one major hope in that direction came from the fact that their actual trial hadn't started yet, partially as Agent Heer was trying to figure out where the two thieves had pawned those things that weren't cash or money.<br />
<br />
Part of me hoped that some of that process would go on until after Molly gave birth, but I couldn't escape that prospect, and so on one evening after work, I decided to do something that Molly would have a familiar face to help her. And as a result, Joseph Patten answered his door shortly after I knocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening, Officer Wayne,&quot; he said politely and formally, &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a very formal response, which I chocked up to the fact that I was still in uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but it isn't business related, I got off duty about ten minutes ago,&quot; I said slowly with a sigh, &quot;but I have a bit of a favor to ask of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this have to do with Molly? Your children?&quot; Patten asked as he let me in.<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded, &quot;Mostly to make sure someone is there in case I'm called to testify before she goes into labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patten didn't immediately answer as we moved into his living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem with it is that we don't know for sure when they'll have the trial set up and ready to go in Washington State,&quot; I gave a sigh, &quot;and since it's a Federal case because of what Grabar and Larceny did in their little &quot;adventure&quot;... I can not be sure they would agree to grant me a personal allowance to stay here for Molly's birth... especially if the judge or the Federal DA decide to have the trial go as quickly as they can...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid I'm not real skilled in many legal aspects in terms of how a judge would run his or her court beyond what would be common sense and the basic parts of procedure that can be researched,&quot; Patten advised, &quot;and I do not have any personal influence in Washington State to use to influence judges there. To be honest, I'm not also not real influential here, either... at least when it comes to these things of getting judicial affairs arranged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not looking to have you interfere in the trial's proceedings,&quot; I assured him, &quot;I intend to try every legal loophole I can to allow me to stay here so that I'm where when Molly gives birth. But if there ends up being nothing that can be done in that regard... I want to make sure that someone is there for Molly...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to help your wife deliver?&quot; Patten gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can't be there,&quot; I nodded, &quot;you work with her every day and see her and talk with her... While Officer Jenkins and Tabby Choir may have personal experience in delivering babies... you're familiar enough with Molly to be able to help her with everything and the things that will be unique to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid I'm not any more familiar with Lamaze and the techniques used to make giving birth easier,&quot; Patten said carefully, &quot;then I would be on influencing judges outside of Montana...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that there shouldn't be any trouble,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Molly and I are expecting my parents to come out for a week or so when she's ready to give birth. I'm sure that if I can't be there they will be involved in helping Molly get through labor... but, I still will need your help as I'm sure you're more familiar some personal things that my parents won't know because they are in Peoria and we are here... and if worst comes to worst, it might be best for Molly to see someone she knows and works with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do what I can,&quot; Patten said slowly, &quot;I'm not sure how much good I'd really do, but I'd do my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all I can ask for,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;and thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patten then nodded. I then got up and went back toward the door as my prime business with Mr. Patten was handled for the moment. It wouldn't truly help my situation, as neither Patten nor I could influence the decisions of a Judge's schedule in Washington State. I was certain that I would be called to testify, but this would would insure that Molly would have a close friend there should I be unable to be there. And that would be the big thing. Making sure that those who would be there would be people Molly trusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; I then stopped as I reached the front door on my way out, &quot;please tell Clemens congratulations on his engagement for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patten nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Things were relatively quiet when I made it back to the Cabin that Molly and I shared. I felt relatively confident in my decision to have Mr. Patten be a sort of &quot;second&quot; should I be called away and there was no way to get the Washington State judge or courts to allow me to remain in Columbia Falls until after Molly gave birth. Patten would be able to insure that Molly would have someone who was familiar with Molly's quirks and likes and dislikes that he could be there to help my parents should I be called away. I was prepared to tell Molly this as I came in, but I couldn't ear any sign of her being downstairs.<br />
<br />
I could hear our dinner cooking in the kitchen. It did smell good, and I assumed that Molly might be looking out our back window into our backyard at the moment. I slowly made my way to the kitchen and looked in to find that there was no one there. I spotted that she'd set a couple of timers and found that they'd only just been set. So, she'd just started cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly!&quot; I called out, hoping to get a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm upstairs, George!&quot; came Molly's reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha doing up there?&quot; I asked curiously as I moved back to the stairs and began to go up them.<br />
<br />
If she was upstairs, I'd tell her about my meeting with Joseph Patten while I changed into something more comfortable then my uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm putting a few things away,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and checking over a few things.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went up the stairs and entered our bedroom to see Molly placing some of her normal clothes in their drawer, or was putting the latest delivery from Rathik and Mugdha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the rest of our order for maternity clothes?&quot; I asked as I sat on the bed and began to take off my uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... these are my normal clothes,&quot; Molly said with a sigh, &quot;clothes I'm presently too fat to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't fat,&quot; I told her firmly, &quot;you're pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly's womb had grown a bit more since its growth had begun to make it obvious that she would need to switch to her maternity wear full time. By now, she was probably ready to make that switch and that was the issue that was occupying her mind. I got up and approached and gave a reassuring hug, nuzzling the back of her neck. I then slowly ran one paw over her womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Within you are our cubs,&quot; I told her, &quot;nothing to be ashamed of. And besides we both knew that you would have to switch full time to your maternity clothes eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Molly sighed, turned her head and returned my nuzzle with one of her own, &quot;but... I guess I just got the sensation that I'd never be able wear my clothes again...&quot;<br />
<br />
I guessed that meant it was a &quot;hormones&quot; thing rather then anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will,&quot; I told her assuringly, &quot;you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then released Molly from the hug and began to change from my uniform and put on one of my normal pieces of clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you don't... I'll put on another couple hundred pounds and we can wear matching muumuus,&quot; I joked.<br />
<br />
That made Molly feel better and she snickered at the joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay as you are, George,&quot; Molly chuckled, &quot;I'm not sure the world is ready to see you in a muumuu.&quot;<br />
<br />
I chuckled a bit at that. After a few moments I then began to talk with Molly about my visit with Mr. Patten. She had not left our bedroom as I changed out of my uniform and put the things that couldn't be washed on the top of our dresser.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need a small safe for your gun when the cubs are born,&quot; Molly commented as I hung my belt up.<br />
<br />
I glanced to it and then to the specially built firearm that had been built for my fingers. I then slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can check for something like that after your next appointment with Doctor Wainwright in a couple of weeks,&quot; I agreed.<br />
<br />
Even if there was no chance of our cubs finding my gun and playing with it, there would still be the possibility of some other child, like Veronica or Megan, who had visited Bandhavgarh in the summer to swim, could find it if it was on a day that I had off... and if not them... there would always be a chance of an accident happening if my gun was left out. Molly did agree to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, I have something else to update you on,&quot; I said to her as I pulled on my shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something else?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I talked with Mr. Patten today,&quot; I told her, &quot;it's nothing super big... a just in case sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just in case?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;in case I get called to testify before you give birth and can't get back in time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly then gave a nervous groan. She didn't like that prospect any more then I did.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens... if they don't grant me the time to be her with you, I've asked him to be there and help you while you're in labor,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, he doesn't have any children... I don't think he even has a girlfriend,&quot; Molly said slowly, &quot;he's devoted the vast bulk of his time to looking after the kids in the school district here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but he knows you and fairly well,&quot; I told her, &quot;my parents can probably help with all the breathing and positioning type things... but if you need something brought from here... or recovered from your desk at school... or have some specific cut of meat brought to you... he will know how you like it and where to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly was silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it's only I can't be there,&quot; I finished, &quot;if you have to other needs... he could help you when it comes to dealing with the pain of labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, George,&quot; Molly said slowly.<br />
<br />
She was about to say more, but her timers then went off downstairs and we were soon on our way to either finish up dinner or flip the steaks while in the process of cooking it.</p>
