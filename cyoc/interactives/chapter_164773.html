<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon woke up from his nightmare with cold sweat dripping across his toned back, his hand flew to his forehead, gripping with fear of the new reality the Chronivac had created for John and him. It wasn’t meant to turn out this way, John was supposed to turn into the child, and Simon would ground him for a change…<br />
<br />
But now John wasn’t even the father anymore, but the <I>older</I> brother with a cougar wife, a bodybuilding competitor, and he couldn’t stand for it. He raked his brain hoping to remember where the Chronivac could have been, much less, the remote he had used to create the entire reality-<br />
<br />
The more time was being spent in this reality, the more he would have to get used to this new older brother, his new sister in law, and… Didn’t he have a sister? Once? Simon felt his mind spinning as he attempted to try and refashion his memories of what was life like before the changes. He was Simon Sanderson, his father never understood him… His brother was a bodybuilding champion- No, no, that wasn’t right, his father… John was once his father. He was… young, very young, and he received something in the mail. That was what started it all, he thought, the damned remote! And now he couldn’t find the blasted thing, meanwhile John was living the best life he could possibly living, flexing those big, muscular peaks and getting groped by his wife, owned the new modern house with luxurious furnishings and…<br />
<br />
Simon shook his head, getting wrapped up in jealousy and anger wouldn’t find the remote, and he wasn’t going to let that get to him. As soon as he could, he’d simply just reset everything back to the way it was, and get his way once more.<br />
<br />
“Yo! Bro!” A familiar deep voice called out, and Simon snapped to attention as he heard the rap against his door. Groaning, he pulled himself out of bed, noting but not surprised that his original cartoon posters and toys were replaced with a study desk and various male products fit for a fitness champion’s brother. Simon opened the door and beheld John once more in his cocky might, his chest handsomely displayed in his large stringer black tank top, and wore grey short shorts that eagerly brought attention to his bulging thighs. He hadn’t shaved, not that it would matter to Kim since she was beginning to crave his rejuvenated youth.<br />
<br />
John smirked, as if knowing Simon was on edge and spoke quite cautiously,<br />
<br />
“Heh, sorry man, loud night again…?”<br />
<br />
Simon sighed, rubbing his eyes.<br />
<br />
“When are you two ever not, John?”<br />
<br />
John looked down, a little somber, but quickly righted his mood as he looked back at Simon with a cheerful demeanor.<br />
<br />
“You wanna, uh, go workout with me? I was thinking, maybe me and you could go grab something to drink or hang out today. Last time I was a little… Well, you know me-“<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, if you got it, flaunt it. I <I>know</I>.” Simon huffed, he didn’t need this from John, and he certainly didn’t need to go to the… The gym! There was the last he had the remote, it could still be there! Unaware that the remote was still in John’s room, Simon quickly formed a plan as John was taken aback.<br />
<br />
“I- Bro, I know we don’t have dad with us, or mom, but, you’re my bro, and I love ya. I know this isn’t what you wanted but, between me and you, I don’t want me and my best bro to fight when we’ve always had each other’s backs. …Kim and I were talking and we thought, you know, maybe we could bond a bit more, you and me. I wanna get closer to you, Simon.“ John clarified, he had clasped his big hands together, and for a moment, Simon’s ears perked up at what could have been his father speaking to him man to man, well, musclebound brute to man. Simon trained his gaze on John, it seemed like he really meant it, though, from the way he had held his hands Simon knew it was also a way for his older brother to show of his engorged biceps Kim and others were so huge on.<br />
<br />
“Uh… sure, let’s go workout da- John. I think that’s a… Good idea.” Simon brushed his hair aside, trying not to let his brother catch on to his awkward feelings. John smiled, chuckling as he went down the stairs yelling about how he was gonna make his “bodybuilder special” omelets for the two of them. Simon sighed, moving himself and falling into his bed staring at his ceiling. What even was he supposed to do when his father was his brother, his mother a sister in law, he was 27 and pretty damn hot, and now we was concerned on whether or not he could change things to his advantage or just… Keep things the way they were. John seemed nicer, he wanted to get to know him more. His old father would never want to do that, he thought, no one ever understood him back then, even his mother.<br />
<br />
What did he want? Did he want to be bigger and stronger than his dad? Did he want to be the one in charge with the job and the one to bring home the bacon this time? <br />
<br />
He smelled the omelets and felt his stomach growl with want as he sent himself to the bathroom to freshen up. His eyes laid on the clock and knew to himself it was going to be a long day, grabbing a pair of shorts and a grey active t shirt. In the distant room, the faint hum of the Chronivac was inaudible to either men as it began to heat up, Simon’s previous inputs were glossed over by John’s and at this point, it would still need to continue…<br />
<br />
______________<br />
<br />
John was an absolute beast in the gym, sure he brought crowds to his workouts, but with more people watching, he felt even more thrown into the exercises as he belted out grunts that made the cameraman of his YouTube channel burn bright red. Simon had tried his best to be as supportive as possible, helping spot him and had been promised that if he messed up, John would only edit the best possible looks he found. In a way, the gym was both a testing and proving ground for him. He faintly remembered a father figure in both their lives, old, bit portly, Simon hated him, said he never saw eye to eye with him. That wasn’t John, though, John built himself up by his own hands all for himself and Simon, he remembered when he first was dating Kim, how she had asked for the cutest fitness trainer and how his gruff hands made her into putty during their first time… <br />
<br />
John tried to register any old memories of this father he had, but couldn’t think of any without making his head hurt. Why was that? Even the word made him feel odd, wasn’t he one? Sure, if you asked who was supporting Simon, yeah, he was like a father to him. John finished his last rep on the bench press, gasping for breath as Simon counted 21, he looked at the camera without even flinching and bounced his large pecs for the viewers at home eagerly waiting for his workout video to be uploaded. Simon even done his own workouts, getting into the swing of it as John pointed out his form and posture to make sure he was absolutely maximizing each rep. He felt a bit more complete as he and Simon finished up their time at the gym, both feeling energized as they were chatting about life and their thoughts with things.<br />
<br />
John drove the way out, laughing as he regaled how Simon blushed hard when he pointed out a girl in pink yoga pants looked a bit too familiar to Amy, the neighbor girl who both had AND made a pass at. John thumped his chest, he felt sore but even thicker than usual, and Simon laughed claiming it was because he was a real meathead to spend all his time at the gym. They decided to go to grab a quick bite to eat at the local restaurant to end off their brotherly bonding “day”. Simon had sat in the booth with John and after devouring food, he felt himself let loosen up as he winked at the waitress who took their orders and passed him a happy hour drink on the house. John made some random comment about how he had a type, and he laughed as if it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard, before taking stock of his surroundings and noticed that he was feeling quite warmer than usual. He looked downward and noticed his grey shirt had felt tighter, his chest becoming more larger as it now created a sensual v-neck into his shirt. His shoulders rounded out, pushing outwards as the sleeves loosened to accommodate his new size. Simon grimaced, confused as he distinctly remembered walking into the gym with a regular grey shirt.<br />
<br />
“You good, bro?” John rumbled from across the table, sipping on some coke so he could drive them home.<br />
<br />
“Uh… Fuck, yeah, I’m good bro-“ Simon croaked, before realizing the foreign word in his vocabulary.<br />
<br />
John nodded, waving over the waitress to receive their check, and soon enough the two were on their way home as Simon fought his stupor as he was trying to collect himself. John helped him inside and said a curt hello to Kim, who was once again watching her soaps. John clapped his meaty hand across his shoulders, telling him how awesome his bro-day was and how much he loved working out with him, Simon nodded through it and watched John wiggle his eyebrows as he pointed towards the bedroom. Thank god Simon would sleep through the future noise, throwing himself into his room and groaning as he felt his head ache and found himself fighting off sleep.<br />
<br />
He turned to the large dresser to change and gasped, as he noticed how much he had changed in the mirror...</p>
