<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you want to see something on stream?&quot; Bradley asked Ryan while he turned the TV on. &quot;I&#39;m in the mood for a superheroes movie, you know I feel like one now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, anything is fine.&quot; Ryan replied while he sat on an armchair, he still seemed uncomfortable of his new body and a constant anxiety was growing inside him. &quot;I think I&#39;m going for a drink, do you want something?&quot;<br />
&quot;A coke can, please.&quot; Bradley told him while he was laying on a couch, he seemed way more comfortable with himself than Ryan. &quot;If you bring some pizza it&#39;ll be excellent! I&#39;m starving!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan opened the fridge and, although he saw several coke cans, his sight was focused on the beer ones on top. He was older, it won&#39;t be wrong if he tried one, he thought. However, at the same time he was thinking on how he was still adapting to his new age.<br />
He decided to stop thinking about it for a while and focusing on the pizza. Fortunately, there were a lot of frozen pizza to choose, so he took several ones and put them in the microwave.<br />
Judging by the sound, the movie had already started and Bradley was completely focused on the muscle guys on lycra fighting demons or monsters, whatever.<br />
When the pizzas were ready, he opened the fridge again and, without thinking too much about, he took two beer cans and walked back to the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bring some pizza.&quot; Ryan said as he put the pizzas on a small table in front of them.<br />
&quot;Oh great!&quot; Bradley smiled and took a slice almost immediately. &quot;And the drinks?&quot; Ryan stared at how wildly was Bradley eating. He remembered that his friend used to be more polite than that. &quot;Uh?&quot; Bradley noticed that Ryan was watching him eating and he just smiled before he swallowed another slice. &quot;Where is the coke?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Ryan apologized for being distracted. &quot;I thought that now that we&#39;re adults we could try these ones.&quot; He put the beer cans on the table.<br />
&quot;Beer? Oh wow! Great idea!&quot; Bradley cheered. &quot;My father and uncles use to drink a lot in parties, so I&#39;ve been curious about it!&quot;<br />
Ryan gave him a slight grin before he took a can and opened it. Bradley did the same but they didn&#39;t drink it immediately.<br />
&quot;Well, here we go!&quot; Ryan said before he took a big sip. At first it tasted awful but as he was going on the taste was becoming more and more comfortable until he realized he had finished it.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really a new experience!!&quot; Bradley shouted a short moment after he finished his own can. &quot;There is more?&quot;<br />
&quot;The freezer is full.&quot; Ryan grinned before they literally raced to the kitchen. None of them cared for the movie anymore nor even turning off the TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, do you want some pizza?&quot; Vivian said while she came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. &quot;I&#39;m a little... what&#39;s going on here?!&quot; She yelled when she saw dozens of empty cand on the kitchen&#39;s ground. &quot;Have you been drinking beer?!&quot; She asked to the drunk men sitting around the table.<br />
&quot;Ooh, yesss!&quot; Ryan replied before he burped. Bradley didn&#39;t even answer, he fell to the ground instead.<br />
&quot;Oh my god! You&#39;re very drunk!&quot; Vivian said while she stared at the almost naked guy on the floor.<br />
&quot;Calm down, babe!&quot; Ryan grinned. &quot;We can handle it, we&#39;re men now, remember?&quot; He flexed his left arm, exposing his big bicep and the thick bush of hair in his armpit.<br />
&quot;Ugh, no!&quot; She replied. &quot;I see you&#39;re still kids in mind. You can&#39;t handle this, you&#39;re drunk!&quot;<br />
&quot;shshshhh!!&quot; Ryan hushed her. &quot;Come here, babe! I know you are upset because you want a little bit of this.&quot; He put his hands over his chest and began to massage his hairy nipples. A brief moment later he tried to stand up but,  being drunk and still unknown of his own size,  he fell on the ground almost identically like Bradley.<br />
&quot;Bla, bla, bla...&quot; Vivian said before she left the kitchen. &quot;Disgusting drunks.&quot; Then, she sat on the couch and watched some TV before she went to sleep.<br />
Ryan and Bradley stood on the kitchen floor for the rest of the night until the next day.<br />
<br />
&quot;My head is spinning..&quot; Ryan said while he was awakening. He felt so dizzy that he needed several minutes to stand up. &quot;What happened?&quot; He looked around and he immediately noticed all the beer cans on the kitchen&#39;s floor. &quot;Holy shit! We really got drunk!&quot; He put a hand on his head and quickly realized something else. &quot;Wait a minute..&quot; He stared at his hand and then at his arm. &quot;What the...&quot; He looked at himself and yelled. &quot;I&#39;M A KID AGAIN!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, shut up!&quot; Bradley said while he woke up. &quot;Don&#39;t yell, my head hurts!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Ryan yelled again. &quot;You too!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhm,  what?&quot; Bradley said still half asleep.<br />
&quot;Wake up, Bradley!!&quot; Ryan shook his shoulders. &quot;We&#39;ve returned to our original ages! We&#39;re kids!!&quot;<br />
&quot;What, wait!&quot; Bradley shouted when he realized what was Ryan saying. &quot;Oh no! I liked to be a grown up!&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; Ryan said. &quot;What are we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, Vivian who had slept in her bedroom entered in the kitchen.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that scandal?!&quot; She said a second before she saw the kids. &quot;Ohohoooh! Look at the big boys that were drinking beer all night! They still don&#39;t have hair down there and they think they can grown ups&#39; stuff!! Hahahaha!!&quot;<br />
Both boys stared at each other and immediately realized that the previously tight boxers now were too baggy that they felt and their puny boyhoods were on display. Obviously, they had reduced in size, length and girth, and all the pubes had vanished like if they had never been there in first place. After having such big mammoths, those things looked pathetic in comparison. They felt really ashamed and quickly ran to their room to look for some clothes to wear.<br />
&quot;Ha! Those kids are really funny!&quot; Vivian said before she started to make her breakfast. &quot;This will be an interesting experiment.&quot;</p>
