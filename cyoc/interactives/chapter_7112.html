<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff Benson followed the instructions in his acceptance letter.  They seemed a little odd, but for $11,850 plus room and board, well he'd do it.  Mr. Tanner his landlord was only to happy to put Jeff's personal stuff down in the basement, and sublet his apartment with his furniture for the summer.  Tanner could get an extra $300 per month for furnished summer rentals. <br />
<br />
Jeff arrived at the night delivery entrance of the NRF and pushed the button.  A couple seconds later the door buzzed, and Jeff entered with only a single suitcase.  A man in a white lab coat waved to him from down the corridor, and Jeff went toward him.  He was escorted into a room with a metal table and chairs to sign the final paperwork.  The young guy seemed about Jeff's age, he identified himself as Steve Carmichael. He was a tense nervous fellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, you've made arrangements with your friends and family and personal affairs, since you'll be incommunicado for the next three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, arranged for everything just like Dr. Norton's letter instructed.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nervous chuckle, and Steve seemed to sigh in relief, &quot;Great.  You'd be surprised how often experiments are delayed because the subject didn't follow directions.  Now if you'll just sign these waivers, I'll get the videocamera ready to record your agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Videocamera?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's standard with all our contract work,&quot; Steve answered dismissively, as he adjusted the videocamera on its tripod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm ready for my close up!&quot; Jeff put his pen down.<br />
<br />
Steve just smirked, the idiot had just signed his life away literally, but said, &quot;You Geoffrey William Benson volunatarily agree to the terms and risks outlined in the documents you just read and signed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure.  I agree to the terms of the experiment.  You'll reactive dormant genes in my body that correspond to active genes in gorillas, to gain insight into early man, and commonalities between gorillas and humans.  The process is new, but has been previously tested, and is fully reversable.  The intent of the study is find treatments to successfully reduce agressive behavior among prisoners in the nation's overcrowded prison system,&quot; Jeff parrotted back the prospectus that Steve had given him.  It sounded good thought Steve, if only it was true.  He'd edit out the details later, all he needed was the sentence that Jeff agreed to the terms of the experiment.  His signature was on the boiler plate pages which would be integrated with the real paperwork later, if necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great,&quot; Steve said turning off the camera, &quot;Now if you could just strip, I have to make sure you're shaved and clean before we can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaved?&quot; Jeff asked as he pulled his shirt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, your hormones will be surging as soon as the first injection takes affect, and you'll sprout hair from places you didn't ever grow hair before.  Don't worry it's reversable,&quot; silently Steve added, except in your case.<br />
<br />
Steve led the now naked Jeff Benson down the hall.  He felt very vulnerable walking down the cold linoleum tiled corridor in his bare feet with his hands over his crotch.  He had expected some humiliation, but this was almost too much.  Still Jeff reassured himself that all the other subjects were receiving the same treatment.<br />
<br />
Yessir, the scholarship will be mine in the Fall, thought Steve,  I can't believe that this idiot beat me out for the Master's Scholarship.  Well, it'll be mine when he doesn't show up to collect it.<br />
<br />
Jeff lathered up with the special liquid disinfectant soap that Steve provided.  The tiled shower was an open affair, but Steve had left to get the shaving equipment, so he had some privacy.  At least so he thought.<br />
<br />
Derek Haines smiled as he watched Jeff lathering up through the one way mirror.  He massaged his crotch in anticipation of his upcoming revenge on the little asshole who broke up his marriage.  The first injection had made him really horny, and Derek was itching all over as his muscular construction worker's body became hirsuit. He had known   that his soon to be exwife was screwing a grad student who was up for the prestigious Master's Scholarship.  Then last week he'd seen Jeff Benson's photo in the school paper, and put a face with his humiliation.  His wife Alice had said there was more to sex than a big dick.  He was just lucky that he had met Steve while visiting Alice at work one day, the guy was a solid dude giving Derek the chance to get back at the man who ruined his marriage.  He'd signed Alice's divorce settlement paperwork, it would be effective in six months if he didn't contest it, but with his rival out of the way, he was sure that Alice would reconcile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, hon, I miss you, too, but you know I have to work late tonight....So, Derek signed the papers, well we can celebrate tonight at 11pm when I get home...Uh huh, Jeff Benson, a high school chum, uh, no can't say I've heard of him, say he applied for a job here as a guinea pig...well, I'll take care of him, if he shows up.  Really have to go now, Kisses,&quot; Steve Carmichael hung up he would get the girl, the scholarship, and $20,000 to boot when he delivered the pair of breeding apes to the zoo.<br />
<br />
Jeff jumped with a start as he felt the razor scrape across his wet skin.  In a matter of fifteen minutes, he was professionally shorn of all his head and body hair even his eyebrows.  He rinsed under the shower once more, towelled off and followed Steve through a door into an adjoining room.  There was another really hairy skinhead muscleman standing naked in the middle of the room when they entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, this is Derek, he's another participant in the study, he already had one injection, about an hour ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jeff, should warn you this stuff not only makes you hairy, it makes you horny, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, that you're acquainted, how about having a seat, and filling out this intelligence test.  You'll receive similar exams after your transformation,&quot; Steve glanced at his watch 7:45pm.  He would be home by 10pm at this rate.  He patted the tranquilizer dart guns in his coat pocket. Can never be too cautious.<br />
<br />
The smell of disinfectant pervaded the room.  But Derek thought he caught a whiff of Alice as Steve and Jeff passed him.  That was all the confirmation he needed.  He grinned at quickly sat down to conceal his huge boner.  He grimmaced as his cockhead oozed against the underside of the tabletop, absently wondering what the janitorial staff might find there later.  He looked down at the exam paper, and started marking answers. He was embarrassed that he didn't know who Charlemagne and Tesla were.  He'd always thought Tesla was just the name of a band.<br />
<br />
Jeff winced as Steve plunged the needle deep into his abdomen, and the stinging liquid spread through out his organs and muscles.  At 8:30pm, Steve collected the tests and administered the second injection to his two subjects.  <br />
<br />
Derek was hairier and hornier than ever.  His forearms and chest looked bigger than they had before.  Jeff was hairy, too.  But his sex drive had diminished if anything.  His genitals had shrunken to be practically invisible under his now bushy thatch of pubic hair.  Both men's noses looked broader and flatter, and their skin tones had significantly darkened, while Steve had been doing legitimate paperwork for his job.<br />
<br />
He could tell Derek was having trouble forming words, and was really anxious to teach Jeff his lesson.  Jeff just seemed dazed and confused, answering questions slowly as if in a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last part of the experiment will be conducted in cages for your own protection, the final transformations can be pretty violent,&quot; Steve explained, as he led them to a pair of steel cages with a common wall/door between the cages.<br />
<br />
Derek frowned seeing the separate cages, then grinned showing his two enlarged canines as he perceived the purpose of the door/wall between the cages.  Jeff wouldn't be expecting it, and wouldn't be able to escape.  Derek screamed an inhuman scream when Steve injected him with the final serum.  The first one stung, this one burned like acid.<br />
<br />
Jeff whimpered and edged away from Steve into the back of the cage.  He could hear Derek screaming and rattling on the otherside of the cage's partition.  He took the injection, bracing for the pain which he knew would follow.</p>
