<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will hesitated and looked at the panties that were partway up her legs. They were incredibly pink, lacey, and looked a little on the skimpy side. She couldn't believe how uncomfortable she felt putting on the sexy underwear of her best friend.<br />
<br />
She looked up pleadingly at Jennifer. Noticing the bemused grin on her face, Will knew Jennifer wouldn't let her back out of this.<br />
 <br />
Will gritted her teeth and continued guiding the panties up her legs. The further the panties slid up, the more her worries and nervousness seemed to fade away. When they reached her waist, she wondered why she had gotten so worked up earlier. The panties were kind of 'cheeky', they were cut up kind of high on her rear, revealing her cheeks. The panties weren't a perfect fit though. They were a little loose. Sure, Will's hips were larger than when she was boy but they were still smaller than Jennifer's curvaceous hips and rear.<br />
<br />
Will was surprised to find that she liked wearing the panties. They were so silky. They actually made her feel kind of sexy, which was kind of a strange but nice feeling. She also felt a little naughty wearing someone else's panties, but she liked it.<br />
<br />
She reached over and picked up the matching pink bra and started to put it on. She didn't feel nervous or hesitant at all this time. Actually if anything she felt a little excited. After  getting the bra on she fumbled with the latches, she never had much experience with that.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was about to help her, when Will finally got it. The bra was too big; a good cup size larger than what her good sized breasts needed. When it came down to it she just didn't have the curves like Jennifer has.<br />
<br />
Will started to fumble with the straps of the bra to see if she could cinch it in a little, when a large finger brushed one of her hands away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't bother, you are about to change anyhow.&quot; said Jennifer with a grin. &quot;Transform so you have my build.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you didn't say the curse. I don't think it will...&quot; Will was interrupted by a tingling sensation flowing through her body.<br />
<br />
Her shoulders and ribs shifted a little while her hips flared out shaping her frame into Jennifer's. The tingling sensation focused more on her breasts, hips, and buttocks as they started to swell. Her ass grew full and round, eliminating the slight gap in her panties. Her growing rump stretched the fabric eliminating any wrinkles until panties fit perfectly. Her breasts swelled and quickly started to fill out the cups of the pink bra. Within moments her boobs were quite large and firm and fit snuggly in the bra.<br />
<br />
Will stared at her body in the mirror near Jennifer, speechless. She couldn't believe how much her figure looked like Jennifer’s. They could have been body doubles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I look... just so... so... how did that work without you saying the curse words?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is part of the transformation you gave me. I can keep making changes to you for a full 15 minutes before I need to pass the curse to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked Will over. &quot;Let's see... what should we do first?&quot;<br />
She cocked her large head to one side and thought a moment.<br />
&quot;Will, I dare you to be more outgoing and forward with everything you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will felt a small tingle in head and for some reason Jennifer's dare made a lot of sense. She really should be out there doing more, taking life by the horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, I also dare you to become bored more easily. You will always need something to do. When you focus on something you will keep your focus, but when something isn't demanding attention your boredom will help fuel your desire to be more outgoing. That should help push the last dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will felt another tingle; she felt herself start to get a little antsy. She couldn't wait for the next dare or transformation that Jennifer was going to give her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finally,&quot; continued Jennifer. &quot;I dare you to never regret anything you do, due to the previous dares. That should prevent future problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the last dare took effect Will couldn't hold back any longer.<br />
&quot;So… are we done with all the dares? I can't wait to see what you got in mind next!&quot; said Will excitedly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer grinned at Will; this was going to be fun. She stepped directly in front of Will.<br />
&quot;Yep, here we go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer started making transformation after transformation; a lot of little details, a lot of little changes. She would try one out, see how it looked, fix it if it needed it, and then do another.<br />
<br />
The transformations swept over Will’s body, adding to her curiosity and excitement. She could feel her body growing, shrinking, reshaping. She could see some of the changes, but her view was limited. She needed to see the whole. She tried to look in the mirror but Jennifer was blocking it. She leaned a little to one side and Jennifer shifted to block it. Will tried the other side and was blocked again. She looked up at Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled down on her. &quot;Nope. Not yet. You can't look until we are all done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on! Pleease? Pretty please?&quot; asked Will in the cutest voice she could muster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; grinned Jennifer. &quot;Nice puppy dog eyes though. Just hold on, it will be done in a moment.&quot; Jennifer continued making more changes to Will.<br />
<br />
As the changes progressed Will continued to get more anxious to see the changes. She stayed still, but she started to fidget more and more. Jennifer had to admit that it was pretty cute. She had never seen Will more excited, animated, and into something before.<br />
<br />
Will spun around towards the door to check herself out real quick in the bathroom mirror. When a large trunk wrapped around her waist and her feet left the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on there, squirrelly girl!&quot; laughed Jennifer as she picked up her smaller friend and dropped her down on the bed into a large pile of throw pillows that were on the bed. Will laughed and scrambled up to a sitting position among the pillow. &quot;Just a little more...&quot;<br />
<br />
Will gave a cute faux pout. &quot;I can be patient. I just don't want to be.&quot; she grinned.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes Jennifer started to slow down on the changes and then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;All done! You look great! Go check it out.&quot; said Jennifer while stepping aside.<br />
<br />
Will jumped off the bed and bee-lined to the mirror. She stopped in front of the mirror and her jaw dropped. Will marveled at her reflection. Was it really her?<br />
<br />
Standing before her was the most beautiful girl she had ever seen.<br />
Her hair was a light blond, so light it was almost white. Her hair went halfway down her back. On each side of her face was a long braid. Each strand of the braid was a different color; aqua, jungle green, and magenta.<br />
<br />
Her skin had a golden tan all over, no tan lines anywhere.<br />
<br />
Will's eyebrows were incredibly thin and almost-white blond like her hair.<br />
<br />
Her eyelashes were long, full, dark, and nicely curled.<br />
<br />
Her irises had flecks of aqua, jungle green, and magenta in them, that seemed to flow and blend like a kalediscope.<br />
<br />
She had a cute pixie-like nose and a pink cupid's bow lips.<br />
<br />
Will's chest ached and it was obvious as to why. Her breasts were nearly a cup larger and were straining against the now too small bra. Her breasts were billowing over the top of the bra and creating a mountain of cleavage. She was tempted to take it off, but she needed it on if she was going to be able to transform Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Her waist narrowed down to less than 18 inches, which was contrasted by her wide hips and round bottom which gave her a nice wasp waist.<br />
<br />
Will stared at her own butt. She couldn't believe how large and round it was. It was stretching out the panties so much it looked like they were painted on. She playfully slapped her ass and watched as it jiggled and swayed.<br />
<br />
She looked at her arms and legs, she noticed they were quite muscular although they were still petite.<br />
<br />
The only hair on her on her body, other than on her head, was a soft downy white-blonde patch between her legs.<br />
<br />
Her fingernails and toenails looked like they had french manicures with aqua colored tips.<br />
<br />
Will turned away from the mirror and looked up at Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow!&quot; gushed Will. &quot;I look great! Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Will rushed over and hugged the elephant girl. Jennifer hugged her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcomed,” said Jennifer. “See? I know what you like. It was worth the wait wasn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will nodded and Jennifer ran her fingers through Will's fine white hair, then stepped back a step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, times up. And the best part of transformation is coming up. Ready for your T or D?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; asked Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, from now on whenever you wear woman's underwear you will turn into your current form with all the transformations and dares you have had so far. The next time you wear men's underwear you will turn back into your normal self.&quot; intoned Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Will felt a tingle come over her body and in the back of her mind she realized the transformation came true and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Will!&quot; Smiled Jennifer. &quot;It is your turn. What do you want to do?&quot;</p>
