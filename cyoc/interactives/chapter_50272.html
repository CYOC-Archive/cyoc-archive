<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra knew all too well that she didn't have much time left before her mermaid tail would show. The itchy feeling on her legs were becoming worse and worse so this was a sign that she would have to hurry. Kendra thought that the girls locker room showers was the perfect place. She knew that the showers were located at the other side of the school though so Kendra darted as soon as she got out of her lesson.<br />
<br />
Kendra found the stairs leading toward the ground floor and she started descending them. A few people passed her on the stairs but she pushed past them knowing her fate. They yelled at her but she didn't care. The outside of the building was in sights and the itch kept on getting worse.<br />
<br />
Kendra barged the doors open and reached outside. The weather was nice and there was nobody around. That was a good sign as she didn't want to be caught running by the teachers. With a small amount of time left and a long way to go until she would reach the lockers, Kendra sprinted as fast as she could. All of a sudden though, Kendra's legs stopped itching but her breasts started receiving a huge amount of pain. &quot;Oh no not now!!!&quot; Kendra thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Her breasts started pulsing with pain and started vibrating. Kendra did not like this sign as she knew this was the start of her transformation. Her breasts were growing, bigger and bigger they grew from an average C cup to a whopping G cup, ripping her small bra and blouse at the same time. It had reveled the giant naked breasts but they started turning blue at the front and the blue started protruding out wards in the shape of 2 seashells. She was growing a blue bra. It covered quite a bit of her breasts when it stopped. Lastly on her breasts, a strap grew around the back so the breasts had support. Kendra had tried before but her bra could never come off until she turned back into a human. Kendra kept running but she couldn't see past her breasts. With knowledge of her next stage she had barely little time left.<br />
<br />
She was getting closer and closer to the locker room but she had a feeling she was not going to make it. Kendra ran past a building when suddenly Kendra's feet started pulsing with pain. &quot;Please not now&quot; Kendra thought. Her feet was beginning it's transformation. Kendra's feet were getting tighter and tighter inside her shoes as they started growing. Kendra kept trying to run as she was but with the pain she decided to take off her shoes. With a desperate attempt, Kendra ripped off her shoes revealing her growing feet. Kendra then started running for the lockers again. It had grown more and more harder to run with her feet but she tried her hardest to make it before it was too late. Her feet grew to a massive 3 foot wide 5 foot long monstrosity.<br />
<br />
Her feet though wasn't stopping, they turned into a gold color and was gaining fish scales from her ankles to her toes. Kendra kept running as fast as her big feet could carry her even as her feet started fanning out and were becoming flatter. Kendra's feet looked like fans when they finished transforming but Kendra was so close, she used her big flippers to walk to the locker room nearly tripping over all the time.<br />
<br />
Kendra felt like she was running on frogs feet or something. She couldn't help but cry as she saw her feet through her boobs. It was just around the corner until she would reach the showers but then her legs started pulsing with pain. She never wore trousers because she thought about if she turned back into human at least she still had a skirt to use. Kendra had no time to lose as her legs started turning gold like her feet. Kendra tripped over her fins and fell over with a thud.The building with the showers was in sights but Kendra could not make it. Kendra looked back at her legs as they were transforming. Within seconds, Kendra's legs formed together from her waist to her fins. Lastly, her legs started becoming bumpy and scaly. Kendra could not help but cry but that wasn't all. Kendra's hair was forming from a small red hair style to a very long blond mess which ran from her head to her waist. Kendra was outside her needed building but luckily no one was around still. Kendra looked at her watch and it was about 5 minutes until the next classes started. Kendra wondered what to do next</p>
