<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty&#39;s dreams were very wet indeed. She was fucked over and over in ways her waking mind couldn&#39;t even describe. And when she woke, her sheets were soaked with more femcum than she realised she could produce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teehee,&quot; came a somewhat familiar voice from the door. Ty looked up from her stained sheets to see Vala standing there, still naked and unashamed in her purple silks. &quot;Look at all that cum! You do the &#39;vixenslut&#39; name proud, sweetie! Though the laundry girls will get mad at this rate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vala?&quot; Ty responded groggily, her nap more of an appetiser than actually sating her need to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to get you up for supper. Come on! It&#39;ll be worth it, promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyana groaned, but reluctantly she slid out of the soft covers, and stood up. She tottered a bit, once again having to get used to her paws and the heavy weight on her chest. Weight that she drowsily examined with her hands, memories blurring with fragments of dreams. Anxiety over her loss of freedom and how much she enjoyed it also wormed its way into her stomach once again, further muddling her thoughts -- and turning her on.<br />
<br />
Vala laughed as the sleepy vixen pleasured herself. Retrieving some silks from a chest of drawers, she helped her new sister &quot;dress&quot; in the erotic strips of fabric. In the process Ty was fully roused -- in more ways than one -- by Vala&#39;s teasing touch; and the two vixens set off for the harem&#39;s dining hall. As they walked, the voluble Vala gave Ty pointers on further refining her natural sway to make her gait irresistible.<br />
<br />
Arriving, Ty found the entire harem gathered around a table already set with porcelain and silver, several platters and bowls of expensive viands set out. The smell was so tantalising to Ty -- who had not eaten since her capture -- that it temporarily drove sex from her mind. Soft strumming filled the air, a gentle melody, though Ty did not immediately see who was playing, so enraptured was she by the food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again, sister,&quot; greeted Rhea warmly from the head of the table. &quot;I hope you rested well?&quot; Ty nodded. &quot;Ah, good. Now please choose a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty did not have to be told twice. She took a moment to marvel at the beauty of the table furnishings, from the carved chairs (designed to accommodate their brushes) to the flower-broidered tablecloth to the ornate stems of her goblet.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fingerbowl is for washing your hands, should you wish,&quot; Rhea told her, indicating the porcelain bowls of rosewater besides their plates; &quot;and cleansing them between courses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Courses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm, our suppers are usually light, but this is a special occasion, so I arranged for a full meal, with appetiser, main course, and dessert. But before we begin, we take a few moments to affirm our love and gratitude for Mistress Luma.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several of the vixens praised their Mistress&#39;s kindness and her body. Ty blushed at the lewd frankness, but found herself nodding. When all eyes turned to her, she added her thoughts in soft feminine voice. &quot;It felt wonderful when I submitted to her. She rutted me so hard... I can&#39;t even remember what it was like to be male. I... I&#39;m not sure I... want to.&quot; The others nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how you feel,&quot; said Alessa, and Marie nodded shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not 100% sure I ever <i>was</i> male,&quot; chimed in Vala. &quot;I don&#39;t remember a thing before the Game!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not worth remembering,&quot; said Sardonica dismissively, and they all agreed. Then Rhea folded her hands to conclude the little ceremony.<br />
<br />
&quot;So let us praise our Mistress and bless her,&quot; she said with sincere ritual. &quot;And may we service her forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May we service her forever!&quot; They all echoed, Ty included.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last thing before we sup.&quot; Rhea&#39;s voice was rather amused. &quot;You have not seemed to notice our new bard.&quot; She gestured to one side of the table, where a horned, red-skinned figure stood by a table laden with its own food and drink, strumming a lute with skilled fingers. Ty started as she recognised the naked musician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph!?&quot;<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
<i>Steph had been flush from several kinds of success. She had been banged by more men in one afternoon than in her entire life on Earth. It still paled to Ty using her as an onahole... but, as kinky as that was, she much preferred proper sex as a succubus tiefling. She had also made more money than she had seen in her life. The fact that she had to give it all up did not trouble her at all -- for now, her lute and her pussy were all that she wanted. The money was, as she had once read, &quot;just a way to keep score.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, too, with the many liquors she had sampled, some with a stronger sexual kick than mere alcohol. With their help, she was still sailing with a full head of steam, and more than ready for the orgy she was to &quot;assist&quot; in with Mistress&#39; harem.<br />
<br />
Still, even for her, hunger eventually overtook lust. After another slave relayed the order that she was to attend the harem this evening, she got directions (the Palace was <i>huge,</I> after all) and left the main brothel to return to Luma&#39;s high hall. Upon entering the harem, she was conducted by a brown-furred vixen to a three-tailed, golden Kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you must be Stephanie,&quot; greeted Rhea with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish. And you may call me Rhea, or revered sister or elder sister. While we are all slaves, we concubines hold a special place -- and you, especially, have been set aside for our service. Not that most of us will insist on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
So saying, she embraced the tiefling with arms and tails. It was the first intimate touch Steph had felt from another woman -- apart from Mistress -- and despite her experience caught her a little by surprise with the feeling of boob on boob, soft fur sliding and compressing on soft skin; the mix of matronly love and self-assured lust radiating from Rhea.<br />
<br />
&quot;For tonight, I would like you to play while we eat; we will have a little table set up so you may refresh yourself between pieces. And after we finish, you may have your fill -- all the food here is of high quality, of course, but the finest dainties are reserved for us and Mistress Luma herself. You will not always have to eat separately from us, but the girls have been craving our own personal bard for years; and this is also a special night for your friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, is that her nickname?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a boy,&quot; observed the brown vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she <b>was</b> a boy.&quot; This drew laughter from the vixens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of us were,&quot; offered a white-furred vixen with eight breasts. &quot;Rhea is the only one of us born female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now Rhea is the only one with a cock,&quot; said the brown girl with mock envy.<br />
<br />
But Steph had already observed that the others deferred to Rhea with love and respect. So she laughed with them, and looked forward to seeing how that cock felt for herself.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, silly,&quot; she greeted Ty, still playing her lute. &quot;You sound so surprised -- Mistress said I&#39;d be sharing the harem with you, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess she did.&quot; Ty blushed a little, not wanting to admit that she was finding it hard to keep her memories straight.<br />
<br />
She found the dinner somewhat surreal. She was a naked vixen, surrounded by naked vixens; where she still felt self-conscious, they flaunted themselves to each other, exulting in their vulnerability. Other slaves of lower rank waited on them, serving them in turn the soup and salad; meats in strange sauces; and finally, to Ty&#39;s surprised delight, hot fudge sundaes. Her best friend was playing music for her entertainment, as if she&#39;d always existed as Ty&#39;s inferior.<br />
<br />
Yet throughout the conversation was fairly normal -- &quot;How&#39;s that book you&#39;re reading?&quot; &quot;Did you hear what so-and-so is doing?&quot; &quot;You looked amazing on stage this morning!&quot; &quot;Are they kicking yet, Lessie?&quot; Even the comments on how handsome a stud this or that client was did not seem overly odd. The only things to disturb her comfort were a few queries into her own feelings -- Ty was not yet sure how she felt, so could not answer. But they did not press, merely offering a sympathetic comment and steering elsewhere.<br />
<br />
So by the end, Ty&#39;s anxiety was quelled, at least for the moment. Also her hunger was sated as never before -- and her arousal was rampant. Unbeknownst to her, their food was laced with aphrodisiacs. They were mild, as much for their own pleasure as for their use in servicing Mistress and customer, but Ty was still very much in heat and emotional turmoil, which made her far more susceptible.<br />
<br />
The cushion upon which she sat was soaked, and she scooted uncomfortably on it, apologising with ears dipped in shame as they all rose to adjourn to the common room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; comforted Sardonica, ruffling her hair. &quot;We&#39;ve all been in heat before. You&#39;re just adding to the perfume.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just before they left, Ty saw Steph set her lute aside and sit down at her own little table as the servers cleared the main one. This reminded her of something. &quot;What about -- Kitty? Doesn&#39;t she, er, he get to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically,&quot; answered Sardonica, &quot;Kitty doesn&#39;t need to &#39;eat&#39; -- he magically derives sustenance from milk and sexual fluids. But, if you&#39;d like, you can take some scraps to put in his bowl. He enjoys the flavour, and the kindness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty decided to do that, and Kitty was overjoyed to see her. She still felt a little odd with the living sex doll... but she was also starting to feel at home, with family and her best friend; and Kitty really was like an oversized (not to mention oversexed) pet. So she stroked him and let him nuzzle and suckle her boobs, ramping up her excitement a bit more before she felt Mistress approaching, and Rhea called for her.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
While Ty had dreamed of her, Luma had wined and dined with her selected guests; and danced for and fucked them. Most thought of the Pleasure Palace as a place where horny males took advantage of yielding female flesh; but many a male also liked to be dominated, whether by cock or pussy, and this was the service Luma provided, both to bottoms and to voyeurs who just liked watching her work.<br />
<br />
Her performance was spiced with danger, for all who submitted to her knew she could well push them that little extra distance, and make them beg for her collar, being transformed from paying guest to gold-earning slave.<br />
<br />
Then she had retired to her private chambers. After parting with Ty she had only taken a quick shower, but with her entertainment done she soaked in a scented bath, as much as to relax as to freshen herself for tonight&#39;s orgy. She gently worked her hands over her body, teasing out knotted fur, admiring her curves, and murmuring spells to replenish her seed and stamina, which she had nearly spent on her customers.<br />
<br />
She herself supped light after, attended by a single -- relatively clothed -- slave girl. Following her own philtre-spiced meal, she cast a final sexual restoration spell on herself. Now her balls hung full and heavy between her thighs, and her beloved vulpine cock was growing slick with readiness. She groaned in appreciation, fondling a milky breast, and bade her Orcish serving maid to have a taste of her pre, before sending her to bed in one of the servants&#39; dormitories; and departing herself for the harem.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
And Pearl supped aboard ship, departing for Celephais on the evening tide. She had long since washed, dressed, packed and applied a glamour to hide her slave collar. Now she practiced with her dual curved daggers, her nimble body adjusting easily to the motion of the ship.<br />
<br />
She wondered how many hot chicks and strong dudes this &quot;Guild&quot; had. How easy it would be to infiltrate them. And if she would really find the coveted Tome for her Mistress.</p>
