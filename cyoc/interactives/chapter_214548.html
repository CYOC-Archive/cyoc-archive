<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">However, before you and Heather had a chance to go shopping you received a text from Amy&#39;s mom. You knew it was her from the photo ID showing her picture as well as the subtle hint of the contact name saying &quot;mom&quot;.<br />
<br />
The text simply read, [Can&#39;t wait to see you at lunch today, are we still on for 11?]<br />
<br />
Had Amy scheduled lunch with her mother? Was this another surprise like Heather taking you out last night? It dawned on you that Amy had never discussed when you were supposed to leave her body, though it probably wasn&#39;t going to happen any time soon.<br />
<br />
You showed Heather the phone. &quot;Now what?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
Heather shrugged. &quot;Amy may have wanted you to go as her to see her mom. For all we know, she could be in on it like I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
You remember that Amy&#39;s mom was cool, but was she cool enough to include in a fetish experience like this? &quot;You think her mom knows I crawled into her daughter&#39;s skin and that you took me out for a threesome last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe she didn&#39;t tell her mom everything, but she may have said something about not being quite herself.&quot;  Heather offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That....might be true. She probably doesn&#39;t know the more explicit details but she could be expecting something.&quot; You chewed on your lip. &quot;How should we handle this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked you up and down, noticeably pausing at your breasts (and it was weird to think that you would be keeping them for awhile). &quot;I say we take the middle of the road approach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I have no idea what you mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t do anything to confirm that Amy&#39;s body has a new pilot, but we don&#39;t necessarily deny it either.&quot; Again her eyes zoomed in on your breasts. &quot;We should put shopping and your new look off for now. Go in her stapple goth attire, the dog collar, the boots, and makeup. You will definitely want to shower and get new underwear and clothes though. When we get there, don&#39;t say anything too obvious about being someone else. I&#39;d avoid confirming that you are the real Amy until we know what she knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I supposed not confirm I&#39;m Amy?&quot; You threw your hands up, which caused some jiggling that you weren&#39;t used to. <br />
<br />
Heather rolled her eyes. &quot;Well it isn&#39;t like most people ask someone they recognize who they are. Besides, we already agreed you&#39;d answer to Amy until we get you out....well that was before we lost the zipper but Amy wanted it that way and we will try to go with her wishes the best we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought about it. &quot;Okay, well if I&#39;m going to try and look like she does, I guess no spy glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll wear those.&quot; Heather assured you.<br />
<br />
Your brain stopped for a moment and rewound the conversation. You remembered she said &#39;when we get there&#39;.. &quot;Wait, you&#39;re coming to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t just abandon you. Besides, between you and me I think Amy wouldn&#39;t want to miss the part where you can&#39;t get out of her, if....when we separate you from her body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather corrected the slip but you knew what she was thinking. While you kept saying that you would be stuck for awhile, it could be forever. You had to do something to distract yourself from that possibility. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but Amy&#39;s mom probably isn&#39;t expecting you. Have you met her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of times. She knows I&#39;m a lesbian.&quot; Heather looked nervous. &quot;Maybe we could say I&#39;m your new girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart started to beat quickly. You liked Heather but had been trying not to get attached since this was supposed to end with you returning to the male side of the equation and Heather losing interest when your dick came back.<br />
<br />
Now, your best friend was basically comatose as long as you were in her body, your dick could be lost to you forever, your old identity was apparently erased and if nothing changed you were going to learn the joys of the menstrual cycle at 19. More time with Heather was probably the only silver lining in this situation. <br />
<br />
You noticed Heather was waiting, getting more nervous. You stepped forward and put yourself up on your toes to reach. Cupping both sides of her cheecks you pulled her down into a kiss. Heather wrapped her arms around you and ran her hands up and down your back. One hand rested the back of your head and the other found its way to your derriere. <br />
<br />
Breaking the kiss, you let yourself drop back to your heels. &quot;I think Amy&#39;s mom will be very happy when I announce that I&#39;m bi.&quot; Heather gave you a look and you shrugged. &quot;Amy has a reputation that makes being a lesbian hard to believe. Besides she will probably still be into guys when we get her back.&quot; You reminded Heather of the end goal. You weren&#39;t ready to give up on her, and regaining your manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, it&#39;s after 10. You take a shower and I&#39;ll pick out your clothes. Afterwards I&#39;ll help you with your makeup and we can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Showering as a girl was a novel experience. Especially since the only time that you saw Amy naked was in a poorly let room while having a threesome. You were more interested in the lady bits that weren&#39;t attached to you at that time.<br />
<br />
Now however, it was hard to not notice the curves that you were lathering with soap. You didn&#39;t get a chance to examine yourself before Heather showed up and unfortunately you didn&#39;t have time here either. Eventually, you promised yourself. <br />
<br />
Rinsing off you found the new underwear Heather left for you. Both top and bottom were black with a red lace trim. You dressed in tight black leather pants and red crop top.<br />
<br />
Heather made sure your face was properly gothed out and the dog collar was in place before donning the spy glasses. Their were butterflies fluttering in your stomachache, and they were only slightly calmed by a reassuring kiss from your new girlfriend. <br />
<br />
The two of you were ready as you went to meet Amy&#39;s mom, who you needed to get used to calling your mom.</p>
