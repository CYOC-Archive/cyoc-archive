<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie panicked and left the changing cubicle which given her state was not the best of ideas.  Looking down she knew the tent in her skirt her erection was still making and the cum stain from where Tiff had masturbated her were to noticeable. He hand moved to cover her embarrassment. This time she was able to touch her erection through her skirt and she tried to push the erection to the side to get rid of the tent in her skirt. Unfortunately this was so uncomfortable, she had to hunch over to keep moving, drawing unnecessary attention to herself.<br />
&quot; Are you ok sweetie?&quot;, asked a passer by. Katie stiffened up and lost grip on her erection making it ping the front of her skirt out again.<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot;, she answered a bit louder than she intended. As she fumbled with her skirt to push her erection down again and scuttled off, the shopper looked as if she had noticed.<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot;, katie thought,&quot; I've gotta hide this up&quot;.<br />
She passed a rack of coats and had an idea. She took a full length bulky one off its hanger, folding it over her arm and letting it drape over her tented skirt. The bulk hid the tent well and she could stand up and walk calmly. She could make for her home like this no one would notice.<br />
<br />
Just as she cleared the store doors, she felt a firm hand on her shoulder and a deep voice saying, &quot;Excuse me Miss, have you paid for that?&quot;, the security man who had stopped her pointed at the coat.<br />
Katie freaked at this point. She pulled away and hurried off calling, &quot;please, I'll come back and pay for it, I just have to go sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
The security guard was having none of it and soon he and another guard caught up with her and grabbed her only a few yards further on. As they grabbed her arms and took the coat, Katie's erection sprang out in her skirt and the cum stained tent was exposed inthe busy street. She reacted without thinking and tried to pull away from teh guards to cover herself up. Unfortunately the guards took this attempt to struggle as an excuse to restrain her and they pushed her to her knees and held her arms behind her back. Katie then went cold at the shocking realisation as she felt the cold metal of hancuffs being locked onto her wrists. How could she hide herself now?<br />
They stood her up and marched her back to the store. This drew the crowds attention and Katie watch the eyes of the shoppers in the crowded store turn towards her to see what was going on. She saw as their eyes first looked at her face, then dropped to her skirt to see the unusual bulging and staining. handcuffed and led away, she was unable to hide herself up. She felt dismal.<br />
<br />
She was relieved when they eventually got back to a back room and sat her down. The chief security guard who had stopped Katie told the other guy to get back on duty. He then turned to her.<br />
&quot;I'm afraid your in a lot of trouble Miss&quot;, he said.<br />
&quot;Please, I had no choice I had to get back home quick, I'll pay for the coat. I'll pay extra&quot;, Katie cried. Had this guy noticed her predicament? <br />
&quot;Yep you're gonna pay. I have to say, you are one of the best looking tranny's I've ever seen, but you can't come in here to get some cheap thrills in our changing rooms&quot;, he told her.<br />
&quot;It's not like that&quot;, replied Katie, and she went on the explain what had happened from being fed the yellow penis shaped fruit.<br />
&quot;That's one hell of a story. I don't believe one word of it. But if you are looking for a way out of this then I'll let you pay for the coat, but you have to agree to something else first. I won't tell you what, but once I'm done, you'll be able to walk out of here free. You won't get hurt.&quot;<br />
Katie had no choice. She could be carted off to jail like she was.<br />
&quot;Ok&quot;, she replied, &quot;but please, I'm scared what I'm agreeing to. Please don't hurt me.&quot;<br />
&quot;You won't like it. Actually, maybe you will, but you won't get hurt&quot;<br />
<br />
The guard led Katie down a corridor and into a room he kept locked. Inside was a boilder room with pipes down the walls and along the ceiling. He undid her handcuffs from one hand and raised her arm up to a pipe junction in the middle on the room. Helocked the free cuff around the pipe. Then he got another pair of cuffs and attached it to her free wrist. The other cuff he locked onto another pipe junction about 1 yard along the ceiling. Katie had to stand on tip toes to reach. When he was finished Katie sttoed their on tip toes with her arms locked and spread out.<br />
The guard looked at her for a minute. He looked at her bulging skirt and put his hand on it giving it a stroke. Although she was repelled at what he was doing, her erect penis couldn't help twitching in response giving away her excitement at his touch.<br />
&quot; Let's see how many times you can cum in an hour? If you make 3, I'll let you go!&quot;, he said.<br />
With that, he moved around her back, took her erection in his hand through her skirts and started to rub it.</p>
