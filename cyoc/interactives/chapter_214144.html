<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Did Roger&#39;s real voice really sound like that? He had never realised how deep his voice was. He was handed the blue panties. They were satin, with a lace pattern on them. He stepped into them. He stopped pulling them up when they were just below his groin. Looking past his now filled bra he could see he now had vaginal crease. His former penis was just visible at the closer end of the lips. He realised he now was a woman. He pulled the panties all the way up. They fit very snuggly over the front of his flat groin, though his now wider hips apparently still had some filling out to do.<br />
 <br />
Liz was buttoning up the shirt Roger had been wearing. She already had his trousers on. She told Roger ‘Hurry up and get dressed. I’ll help zip you up. We will have to be quick as the plane will start boarding very soon.<br />
<br />
Roger pulled the slip over his head. He had observed Maureen getting dressed many times and knew how to put it on. ‘Do I need to wear the panty hose?’ he asked. His voice was now totally feminine. He recognised Liz’s voice.<br />
<br />
‘I suggest so. They will help to avoid DVT and the boots will fell scratchy without them’<br />
<br />
Roger had seen Maureen putting the pantyhose plenty of times as well. He had no bed to sit on though and had difficulty. He wasn’t used to the long fingernails he now possessed. He clearly took longer than Liz expected. ‘Careful you don’t put a ladder in them’ He found himself lifted bodily by Liz and placed so he was sitting on the baby change table. Liz then proceeded to roll the pantyhose up his legs.<br />
<br />
Liz was completely dressed by now except for Roger’s sports jacket. She took over the dressing of Roger. She had him step into the dress then pulled it up over his torso and zipped him up at the back. It was knee length and had sleeves that reached to his elbows. It hugged the contours of his body. The material was soft and slightly stretchy.<br />
<br />
‘It’s a cotton blend, comfortable isn’t it?’<br />
<br />
Liz opened the door once more. ‘There is a queue out here. Are you nearly ready?’ <br />
<br />
Maureen was looking at Roger. Liz answered. ‘Just need to put her shoes on. Then you can take her to the ladies and fix her make-up’<br />
<br />
Liz helped Roger into the long boots. They zipped up. She then gathered her jewellery into her handbag. She made Roger put the bag over his shoulder. Then they left the room. <br />
<br />
There were at least two mothers with toddlers eager to have access to the change room. They gave Roger a disgusted look as they pushed past him.<br />
<br />
Maureen giggled when she saw her husband in Liz’s green and blue patterned dress. ‘They think you two were having sex in there. They wanted to call security’<br />
<br />
‘Take her to the ladies and fix her jewellery and make-up. I’ll wait outside with the carry-on bags’ Roger wasn’t sure he liked Liz to call him by the feminine pronouns but then he glanced down at his body. It was appropriate.<br />
<br />
Maureen hustled Roger into the lady’s toilets. He had trouble walking in the heeled boots. They had heels of about 2 and a half inches. At least the heels were broad. Maureen must have realised his problem. ‘Land on your heel first and take smaller steps. You will learn in no time’<br />
<br />
They went to the far end of the toilets where there was a free space near the mirrors. The bathroom was crowded but they were the only people using the mirrors for make-up.<br />
<br />
Roger looked at his reflection and saw Liz looking back at him. He was 100% Liz, with every one of Liz’s feminine curves on full display. The medallions changes were apparently complete.<br />
<br />
Maureen found Liz’s bracelets, one for each hand and the necklace she had been wearing. Not the medallion that had caused Roger’s problems but a silver locket on a chain. She passed them to Roger, assuming he could put these on himself. She put Liz’s earring in. Roger now for the first time in his life had pierced ears. He flinched as Maureen put the pins through his holes. ‘Do I really need to. Don’t they cause problems going through security?’<br />
<br />
‘They are silver. They don’t set of the alarms. If you have to walk through a scanner perhaps take off the necklace but the earrings and bracelets should be fine’ <br />
<br />
Maureen then set about reapplying make-up to Roger’s face. Roger felt embarrassed standing still in the toilets, as an apparently grown woman getting make-up put on by someone else, but Maureen didn’t seem the least bit concerned. She kept telling him to “Keep still’ and made him pout while she applied Liz’s red lipstick. <br />
<br />
Maureen didn’t even warn Roger before spraying the new woman with Liz’s distinctive scent. Lastly, she found a brush and fixed Roger’s hair.<br />
<br />
‘Okay. You look good now. I’d suggest we find a cubicle here as it’s much easier than on the plane. Empty your bladder and bowels if you can and don’t forget to wipe’ Roger hoped none of the other occupants were listening.<br />
<br />
That took a while. Maureen hadn’t given Roger any instructions about wiping the seat before he sat, but he did anyway. It was easy enough to pull down the panties and hitch up his dress. The pee didn’t come straight away but Roger did find he needed to void his bowels. At least that worked in the exact way he was used to. When the urine finally arrived it came as a bit of a burst. He used some toilet tissue to wipe.<br />
Maureen was waiting at the basin for him. He washed Liz’s hands then followed Maureen back to where Liz was waiting. <br />
<br />
‘We need to hurry. They just called our flight’</p>
