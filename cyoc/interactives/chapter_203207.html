<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared was still in disbelief about this. This was actually working. He could have whatever he wanted.....<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot;<br />
As the monkey butler, who Jared renamed Buttface, cleaned, he got an idea and went back to his room. He began typing away....<br />
<br />
Meanwhile a girl with hair in a brown ponytail and beautiful green eyes was in her bedroom reading a book she had to finish for school. It was Mindy Ferris, the most popular girl in Jared&#39;s grade. Not only was she pretty, but she was also one of the most intelligent girls of the school. Her intelligence bordered on AI levels of intelligence. However she wasn&#39;t the kindest person. In fact she was rather passive-aggressive towards most people, and she tended to pick on Jared and even bully him, despite him having the biggest crush on her. She was also taken.<br />
She&#39;d taken her makeup off, making her look tired and her acne was showing as she wore comfortable and baggy clothes. She was a bit overweight, but it was mostly due to a genetic condition that made it difficult for her to lose weight, meaning that while she did indulge in a little treat every now and then, she stuck to a pretty healthy diet and tried to get in at least a ten-minute walk each day. Sometimes she&#39;d have enough freetime where she was able to go to the gym. Sleep, however, was her kryptonite. She had chronic insomnia, which was likely why she was always so mean to people. However, it wouldn&#39;t last for long.<br />
As she read, she began to change. Her figure became slightly hourglass-shaped while her slightly-noticeable facial asymmetry was completely corrected. Her breasts became perfect d-cups and her butt expanded to a noticeable size. Meanwhile her eyes became bigger and the color became a beautiful sparkling pink; her hair dropped from its ponytail, turning a soft bubblegum pink, one that would never have a bad hair day. The bags under her eyes were healed and her acne disappeared entirely, giving her skin a soft, porcelain appearance. Her lips also increased in size just slightly that she would look adorable when she pouted. Her nose slimmed down slightly as well and color flushed to her cheeks. Her baggy clothing turned into a typical school uniform that one would find in anime with just a bit of the top unbuttoned to hint at her cleavage. Her eyesight worsened and prescription glasses appeared on her face. <br />
Mindy also began to change mentally as well as her health. Her memories and personality were changed. She remembered being born in Kagawa Prefecture in Japan as Mineko Tazawa to a noble family. They decided to move to the U.S. to give their daughter the chance to get an education. She was homeschooled at first, but then was enrolled in public high school. She was practically worshipped by everyone, but she managed to maintain humility. <br />
Her personality became softer; she was shy with most people, but with her loved ones, she was very sweet, affectionate, and caring. She also gained skills such as cooking, cleaning, makeup, increased info retention, mechanics, martial arts, katakana, poetry, origami, poise, grace, charisma, engineering, anthropology, physics, philosophy, budgeting, mathematics, economics, sewing, etiquette, photography, eloquence, public speaking, traditional dancing, singing, languages, the works. She also became impervious to diseases such as cancer. Her weight condition also eased up, making it easier for her to lose weight. Her insomnia also cleared away. She became fluent in Japanese and proficient in English.<br />
But another thing she remembered was the devotion she felt to her boyfriend, Jared.<br />
&quot;Shi ha kare ni kai i ni iku hitsuyou ga ari masu, (&quot;I need to go see him&quot;)&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Kare haa so ko de kodoku o kanji tei runi chigainai. Tai tte&#65281;Shi ha saisho ni ano tame ni yaku hitsuyou ga ari masu&#65281;(He must be feeling lonely over there. Wait! I must bake for him first!&quot;)&quot;<br />
Immediately she went over to the kitchen and whipped up delicious treats for her boyfriend before heading off to his house.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jared smirked as the program kicked in. All he had to do now was wait.</p>
