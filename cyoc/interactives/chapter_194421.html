<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric shut the door to the communications room behind him, the party was winding down but he felt he had one last piece of business to do tonight. He had asked Tom to wait for him, but he felt he needed to do this alone. Clyde had told him to take all the time he needed and would be waiting at home. He adjusted the straps of his formal harness, making the bells jingle softly as he looked over the monitors. The place looked like a NASA control room from a movie, but Rudy has said the phones here could call outside. He had laughed when Eric asked permission to use them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on the team, you have full access to the workshop other than the Claus&#39; private rooms. Just don&#39;t linger on the workshop floor, the elves get testy if we get in the way.&quot; Rudy showed him the way, then went back to the winding down party, bemoaning he had to be the last one to leave.<br />
<br />
Eric sat down at one of the phones and picked it up, dialing a familiar number. Sure it was after midnight here, but where he was calling it was probably still early afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, mom, it&#39;s Eric.&quot; He leaned back in one of the chairs, he had been running this conversation in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sweetie! How&#39;s everything going? You sound a little hoarse. Did you get a cold?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. Probably just a weird connection. It&#39;s great, I love it up here.&quot; He went through the pleasantries, telling her what sort of amenities were up here, and how nice the &#39;people&#39; were. Even that Tom had showed up but he&#39;d let him update her on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you didn&#39;t stay up this late for what&#39;s probably an expensive long distance call just to chat my ear off. You need to tell me something, I can hear it in your voice, Eric. You know I know.&quot; She always did know. He could never hide anything as a kid, and even now it was hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, got a job offer up here actually.&quot; He tapped the desktop, hearing silence for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;A job? Does it pay well? Doing what?&quot; She actually sounded excited, and a weight lifted off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s good, definitely more than enough to live on. It&#39;s in, um.. transportation logistics.&quot; He furrowed his brow, not really being able to tell her the jo and that just sort of popped out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric. What do you know about that? You haven&#39;t even gone to college. Is this with the resort? Not to sound disparaging, but are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I apparently have a knack for it. They want to put me on their lead team, train on the job sort of thing. Not the resort, it&#39;s a, uh, affiliated company. It&#39;s kind of why I called. I want to take it, but Christmas is their busy time so I&#39;d need to be here to learn. But I&#39;d like to come home after New Years for a visit.&quot; The other end was silence for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I want for you is what you want for you. If this is what you want, just, maybe take some online classes while you work. I want you to have a degree, too. And of course you&#39;re welcome to visit.&quot; He could hear she wasn&#39;t completely happy, not that he&#39;d be away, certainly, but she was already prepping for him to go to college next fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s okay, I might bring someone with me.&quot; Eric said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A job and a someone. Is he cute?&quot; She laughed brightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve uh..&quot; He couldn&#39;t tell him mom they were essentially engaged after a week. She would flip. &quot;Had a few dates, been spending most of our time up here together. I really like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like? I know that tone. My little baby is in love. Well, it&#39;s late over there and you probably want to sleep. Good night, sweetie. And tell your brother to call me. It&#39;s been three months. Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Eric stepped back into the house from the snowy lane. Flakes had started drifting down from the sky, and it was nice to walk alone for while to be with his thoughts. He put a hand on the door frame. Not the house, not Clyde&#39;s house, this was going to be their house. His new home. He added shipping some items up here to the list of thing to do when he finally visited home. At least clothes would be off that list.<br />
<br />
He came up the stairs and opened the door to the bedroom. The human on the bed lowered the book he was reading and grinned at Eric. Completely nude, well muscled, with a thick chest hair, and a strong square face with just a few days worth of stubble. He was also completely naked. &quot;Clyde? What are you doing?&quot; Eric couldn&#39;t help but laugh a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting used to being like this a bit more, I&#39;m going back with you when you visit your folks, right?&quot; He held up and arm, showing a shiny metal bracelet on his arm. &quot;And I&#39;m trying out one of your gifts, see if they work. Couldn&#39;t even will myself back right now.&quot; Clyde set his book aside and scooted to the end of the bed as Eric stepped closer. &quot;I also wanted to see something.&quot; He added softly as he began to undo the buckles on Eric&#39;s harness.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Eric said as he leaned in, pressing his nose into Clyde&#39;s hair. Even as a human he smelled like him, just the slightest hint of his spruce scented fur shampoo mixing with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What it was like for you those first days.&quot; Clyde stood and helped Eric out of the harness, hanging it carefully from a bed post. &quot;Hitto, I think you might be bigger than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked Clyde up and down, then laughed. Clyde did not make a small human, in fact he was pretty tall and muscled, but no reindeer was small and Eric did indeed have a couple inches and probably a handful of pounds on human Clyde. &quot;Oh well, it&#39;ll make it easier to ride you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. what?&quot; Eric asked a bit stunned as Clyde pressed against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, fur on skin does feel nice.&quot; Clyde snuggled into his chest which made his cock start to stir, he could already feel Clyde&#39;s trapped between them. &quot;Ride you.&quot; He said after a moment. &quot;I want to switch it up, tonight. What? Have you never? Don&#39;t like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shook his head. &quot;No, I&#39;ve just always.. um..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you know until you try it? Just because I prefer a nice squash.&quot; He mumbled as he squeezed Eric&#39;s ass. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want a juicy carrot now and then.&quot; And at that he felt fingers wrap around his cock. He pushed Eric onto the bed and climbed on top of him, he may be wanting to bottom, but he was still taking the lead, which let Eric relax a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just compare me to food?&quot; Eric laughed softly, as Clyde straddled his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;It did sound better in my head, in Finnish.&quot; Clyde admitted before leaning in to kiss Eric on the muzzle. &quot;I just want to know what you felt. Why you picked me.&quot; Eric grabbed Clyde around the waist, helping him guide himself onto Eric&#39;s cock. Clyde let out a deep moan while Eric shivered. He had expected it to feel like a tight blow job, but it was so much better.<br />
<br />
Clyde began to slide up and down Eric&#39;s shaft, the tight warmth of him feeling unlike anything Eric had ever done before. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be bad to switch it up once in a while. And it was strange being the bigger one, like he had lost a favorite blanket. But all those thoughts blew away as Clyde&#39;s hands pressed against his chest, massaging the muscles as he rose up and down. Eric wrapped thick fingers around Clyde&#39;s shaft and stroke him in time with the bucking of his hips.<br />
<br />
He came first, teeth gritted as he shot his seed into his soon to be mate. Warm globs of Clyde&#39;s own seed landed in his fur, though neither paid it any mind as Clyde collapsed to the bed next to him, head on his chest, Eric&#39;s arm under him. &quot;Do you mind if we spend the night like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
When Eric said, &quot;Not at all.&quot; Clyde snuggled up against him with a yawn. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was worth staying up for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know.&quot; Eric said, resting his chin on Clyde&#39;s hair. &quot;I picked you because you&#39;re handsome, sweet, and have a really big..&quot; <br />
<br />
Clyde nudged him in the side before he could finish. &quot;Don&#39;t ruin the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to say antlers, nothing dirty.&quot; Eric felt Clyde laugh softly, then slowly drift off snuggled up to him.</p>
