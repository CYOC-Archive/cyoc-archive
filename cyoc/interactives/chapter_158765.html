<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gratefully, you accept the offer, after the dirty tunnels it feels wonderful to have the clean, cool water running down your throat. &quot;So what happened here anyway? I didn&#39;t know there was a whole beastman kingdom, much less this many of you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv took a seat on one of the stones, brushing some dirt off his fur. &quot;There wasn&#39;t until about two years ago when Riefclaw showed up. I don&#39;t know where he go the curse, but he infected a few commanders of the knights and the guard and got a rebellion going once they were turned.&quot; The stag leans back and you can feel his eyes lingering on you. &quot;Had the local lord executed, rounded up all the men, had the women and children exiled since the curse wouldn&#39;t work on them, then converted all the men and declared himself king.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all the men were just.. fine with this?&quot; You take another sip of water then pour a little over your hands to clean them, your nails look absolutely filthy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The curse changes you. Most don&#39;t care about their old lives, those that did ended up in hard labor jobs, or have to live on the outskirts like me.&quot; Yuriv leans forward, watching what you are doing.<br />
<br />
No, not filthy, they&#39;re just darker and harder. You sigh. &quot;And so you&#39;re helping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because anything to piss off Riefclaw. It&#39;s a past time of mine.&quot; Yuriv smiles brightly and you find yourself melting, you want to press your mouth against that muzzle and feel your tongue dance against his. You shake your head, trying to clear your thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just leave then?&quot; You stopper the water skin and hold it back out towards Yuriv.<br />
<br />
&quot;And do what? Go live in a human kingdom? I&#39;m finding it hard enough to control myself around you. I go live among humans and the curse will be spreading in no time. I know Riefclaw will get bored with his little kingdom here eventually and try to expand, but I&#39;d rather not speed up the process.&quot; Yuriv shakes his head. &quot;No, I&#39;m pretty much stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s too late for me, now.&quot; You say dismally as you look down at yourself. The hair on your chest is definitely thicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;d say you have about three days before the curse is complete, we could still get to my wizard friend.&quot; Yuriv shrugs. &quot;Besides, the knights don&#39;t know you&#39;re infected. Keeping you away from them will continue to annoy them. So I still win.&quot; He gets to his hooves, slings his pack over his shoulder, and motions you to follow. &quot;C&#39;mon.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not sure how good deer eyesight is in the dark, but you don&#39;t really have a choice but to follow after him, or going running back to the knights, though you half feel their going to track you down anyway. Besides, you do like the sight of him from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Yuriv&#39;s question catches you off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, why are you here. Hell, you haven&#39;t even told me your name.&quot; The stag looks over his shoulder and smiles at you. So you tell him, your name, the fact you found yourself out here because you wanted to be an adventuring hero and heard strange rumors. &quot;See, you should be a thief, like me. Easier life. Just gotta worry about yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re trying to save me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That shuts him up for a moment, until he speaks up again. &quot;Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.&quot; He looks around. &quot;This should be the place.&quot; And he scampers off the trial and into the trees. You manage to follow his bobbing antlers through the brush, and then you see his head and arm pop up, waving you over.<br />
<br />
You venture off the trail after him, and just in time to see him disappear behind a rock. As you get there yourself, you notice a crack in the rock and follow him in, squeezing through until you find yourself in a cavern, a split in the top allowing in some moon light to illuminate the space. The ground is covered in soft ferns and mosses. &quot;We can spend the night here.&quot;  e turns to smile at you and you just can&#39;t help yourself.<br />
<br />
Your body seems to move on its own and you are suddenly pressed up against him, your lips pressed against his muzzle. He seems shocked at first and then melts into the kiss. This close you can smell his musk, deep and earthy. It smells even stronger than before, and you don&#39;t know if that&#39;s from all the running away the two of you have been doing, or because your sense of smell is getting stronger.<br />
<br />
Turning about, he presses your back up against one of the cave walls. His mouth leaves yours and he begins to explore your body, sniffing your pits, giving a quick nibble at your nipple, and running his tongue across your sweaty, furry chest. Every touch sends a shiver up your spine. His explorations continue southwards, until his nose is pressed up against the crotch of your trousers, the front straining to hold your cock back, a damp stain spreading from your arousal. He licks at the fabric then pulls down your pants, freeing your cock.<br />
<br />
At first you worry what it&#39;s going to look like, but to your surprise, it is still definitely human looking, though maybe a bit bigger than you remember it being. He opens his mouth and takes your whole length into his muzzle, his nose buried in your much thicker than it used to be pubic hair. You feel his tongue running along the base of your shaft, and teasing the slit. You have to steady yourself against the wall to keep your knees from buckling. Hours of pent up horniness suddenly finding release after a few minutes of suckling from the stag.<br />
<br />
He eagerly drinks up your seed, a deep moan passing from your throat as your orgasm washes through you. But soon, Yuriv is on his feet and moving to another part of the cave. He drops his shorts, and you get a good view of his long, extremely rigid cock as he begins to furiously pump away at it. You take a few steps towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; He barks the order at you, bringing you up short as his own orgasm paints the wall of the cave with his seed. &quot;Oh.. fuck.&quot; He gasps for breath and looks over at you. &quot;Damn it, Nate, if I got any of that on you, you&#39;d be changed in a matter of minutes. What were you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at the smear of stag cum covering the wall and the idea of licking some up only briefly passes through your mind. &quot;Me? You didn&#39;t seem to fight it very hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriv just looks annoyed for a moment, but you&#39;re having trouble keeping your eyes on his face and not his cock, which is now flaccid but still surprisingly long, hanging halfway down his thighs, with a nice pair of plump balls behind. You find yourself wanting to bend over, and let him have his way with you. He roughly tugs up his shorts, cutting off your view and finds a place to lay down. &quot;We should probably sleep on opposite sides, so we&#39;re not.. tempted to do anything in the middle of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You find it odd that you feel a bit hurt as he turns his back on you as he settles in. You pull your pants back up and decide the spot where you are is good enough. You tamp down a stray thought lamenting the fact you didn&#39;t grab Yuriv&#39;s cloak before you ran, it&#39;d make a good blanket, and it smelled like him.  You scrub at your face angrily, why were you acting like this? Was it the curse or something else..</p>
