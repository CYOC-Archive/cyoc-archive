<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And these are your hormone levels,&quot; Dr Ansi said indicating to a section of the printed out of information. &quot;Over the course of me seeing you, your androgen levels have dropped, whilst your oestrogen and progesterone levels have risen, all to the point where, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d swear I was looking at the normal, healthy hormone levels of a girl of fifteen. It&#39;s my opinion this explains part of the reason why you are witnessing more female characteristics, such as breast growth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s causing it?&quot; Mrs Parker inquired. &quot;I mean, so far as I know, it&#39;s not possible for a boy to undergo as much change as Jon has, not unless their body is normally like this or they are taking something, such as hormones.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shake of her head, Dr Ansi affirmed, &quot;No, what we&#39;ve seen wouldn&#39;t be possible, unless there is an outside source, as it&#39;s already been determined nothing about Jon would lead to such things as we&#39;ve witnessed. Jon would either have to have been born female, or be on a monitored hormone dose for an extended period of time. As the shift is recent, and Jon hasn’t been taking anything, we wouldn’t see the amount of change witnessed. And then there&#39;s the loss of height, as Jon&#39;s records indicate they were almost five-six five months ago, and they now stand five-one. Hormones and puberty blockers would not be able to account for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
From where he sat, Madison listened to all this, and couldn&#39;t help himself as he bristled every time the doctor called him by his male name. He didn&#39;t want to respond the way he kept doing so, and did his best to hide anything to indicate how he felt. But ever since he&#39;d started using a girl&#39;s name, it was as if something he didn&#39;t want to give up had been lost, and now he couldn&#39;t stand it whenever anyone called him by his male name. Trying to reason it was who he was, and was the name he&#39;d been given by parents who he hadn&#39;t seen in almost three years, Madison couldn&#39;t bring himself to except he was Jon, as it no longer felt right to think of himself by a boy&#39;s name. Wishing he had never started using a girl&#39;s name, but seeing he had had no choice, he wondered how much longer it would be before he self-identified as a girl as he tuned back into what his foster mother and the doctor were talking about.<br />
<br />
Not understand a lot of what Dr Ansi was saying, he reached for the print out after a bit and pretended to read it. Having been seeing the doctor for a little almost two months now, the most he could get out of the visits was he was healthy for a girl, and there seemed to be nothing to explain why what was happening to him was happening. The visits turning more and more into physicals to make sure he was healthy, he was soon frustrated by them, especially as it meant Dr Ansi wanted to examine certain areas, poke and prod him, as well as the take different samples, including, but not limited to blood and urine. And of course, as his breasts had developed, she taken an interest in them and began to inspect them every time he went to see her, leaving him to learn, as she made sure there were no lumps or anything off, he didn&#39;t like sitting in an unfamiliar room, naked from the waist up, all whilst someone checked him over. Feeling exposed, he had tried on a couple of times the same tactic which kept her, so far, from inspecting his privates, but it hadn&#39;t worked.<br />
<br />
Dr Ansi had instead made a solid argument of why he should remove his shirt and bra, then, to emphasis her point, had brought in Mrs Parker, who&#39;d sided with the doctor. The whole thing ending with both saying things along the lines of, &quot;We just want to make sure you&#39;re healthy,&quot; and, &quot;We&#39;ll work up to when you are comfortable with a full-body physical, okay?&quot; Madison had begrudgingly relented.<br />
<br />
Of course there were things he wanted to ask, more so than before. But, still unsure about his body, if it&#39;d be okay, Madison kept silent, knowing, eventually it&#39;d have to talked about. Setting back down the print out, trying to not think about the latest change her body had undergone, she listened as the doctor, pointing to things on a computer screen, commented, &quot;This is also something I have never seen. When Jon first started to see me, and I asked for specific samples, I started to monitor a number of things. Among the specific lab results, I wanted to check on something and make sure Jon was genetically male, feeling if he wasn&#39;t, this might give us a clue as to what was happening. And the test results which came back, they confirmed, as you can see here,&quot; she pointed at a number of things, &quot;by these genetic markers, Jon was male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean he was male?&quot; Mrs Parker inquired, and Jon wondered the same thing.<br />
<br />
With a series of clicks, Dr Ansi cycled forward though information, elucidating as she did, &quot;I have been keeping tabs on Jon&#39;s data, and have noticed, between this visit, the last few a change which I cannot explain. Here, you can see these markers I&#39;ve highlighted, which indicate the individual these results are for are male. But these,&quot; and she moved the information further forward, &quot;these indicate the individual is female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stunned silence greeted this, and as Mrs Parker fumbled with something to say, Madison&#39;s mind leapt to the recent change her body had made. A sinking feeling coming over him, he couldn&#39;t help himself as he thought, &quot;No, no, no. I am not a girl. I don&#39;t want to be,&quot; but couldn&#39;t finish the train of thought, as, like so many things he tried to convince himself about, he could bring himself to accept or believe it. Hugging himself, Madison stared at the computer screen and the area Dr Ansi had been directing their attention to, and unable to make sense of what he saw, he whispered, &quot;There has to be some mistake. The data or results or whatever has to be off. I mean, it&#39;s not even possible, is it?&quot; and before the doctor could respond, Madison leapt up and raced out of the room.<br />
<br />
Not paying attention to where he was going, Madison slowed after some time. Dr Ansi&#39;s words echoing inside his head, he wandered for a bit before turning around. Deciding to head back to the waiting room and wait for Mrs Parker, he stopped when he passed a bathroom. Seeing it was one the type for a single occupant, Madison knocked, and when no one answered, entered. Closing and locking the door, the light automatically coming on the instant he entered, he approached the sink. Peering into the mirror above it, seeing a teenage girl looking back at him, the words, &quot;Normal, healthy hormone levels,&quot; and &quot;the individual is female,&quot; raced about his head.<br />
<br />
Muddled up, not sure which he wanted to be true, to be a girl or to be a guy, his focus shifted when he saw there was a second mirror in the bathroom. Turning to face it, the reflective surface large enough to show his full reflection, Madison self-consciously adjusted the top he had on and the jean jacket he had on over it. Thinking about the other thing bothering him, he ran a hand over the skirt he was wearing and, before he could change his mind, he reached up it. Without pushing the skirt up, he gripped the waistband of the thong he had on and rolled it down until he was able to step out of it.<br />
<br />
Panties set on the sink’s edge, then shucking off his jacket, he hung his outer wear on the back of the bathroom door. Top and bra coming off next to be hung on the door, Madison stepped back in front of the mirror. Staring at the girl he saw reflected back, he reached around to his left side and unzipped the hidden zipper. Letting the garment drop, he caught it before it hit the floor, and stepping out of it, he set it on the sink, removed his footwear and stepped back in front of the mirror. Seeing his reflection, what Dr Ansi had said still heavy on his mind, Madison cupped his breasts. Feeling the soft skin, the way his nipples pressed into the palms of his hands, how sensitive the B cup mounds were to touch, he started to lower a hand as he gazed at his crotch, then stopped. Having never touched himself down there since the transformation had started, except when washing himself and after using the bathroom, Madison hesitated before spreading his legs.<br />
<br />
Hand placed flat against his abdomen, he stared at the lack of anything visible between his legs. Knowing there was something there, just not what he normally saw, he again thought, &quot;Individual is female,&quot; as he stared at the one thing he was keeping from Dr Ansi, Dr Deks, the Parkers, even Lucy.<br />
<br />
Over the course of a week and a half to two weeks, Madison had watched and observed as the last thing which stated he was still male shrank and pulled tighter and tighter against the area betwixt his legs. Not wanting it to go, but unsure what he could do to stop it, he&#39;d been confronted by the biggest discomfort he&#39;d ever felt since he&#39;d begun becoming a girl as inside his groin and abdomen, he was overcome with a pressure which seemed to wax and wane, and sometimes got so bad, it reminded him of the handful of times he&#39;d gotten kicked in the nuts. By the third of October, it had passed, and he was now female down there. Staring at the area, thinking of what he saw when he’d used a hand mirror to look at his vulva, still put off to think he had such a thing, he dropped his hand lower. Brushing it over the soft pubic hair covering his groin, still thinking about how the tests said he was a girl, he touched his female genitals. Unsure of what he was doing, exploring anyway, still cupping one of his breasts as he did, Madison began to massage the lump of flesh in a clumsy manner as he for the first time touched his vulva, his clit, for reasons beyond how he usually touched the area down there.<br />
<br />
Flushed, getting aroused, Madison thought he ought to stop. But then, as he started getting wet, slick, he found he didn&#39;t want to. And when he slipped a finger back along his pussy, into his vagina, he gasped, then moaned silently as he did. Squatting down, he worked the area until he felt himself climax and cum. Feeling as if something shifted, but not caring as what she was feeling was the greatest thing she’d experienced since turning in a girl, as well as if was able to go on, Madison continued to breath heavily as she masturbated for the first time as a girl.<br />
<br />
Turned on, hornier than she&#39;d ever thought possible, she climaxed a few more times before, feeling as she was done, she straightened and walked over to the sink. Hands placed on the sink, she gazed at her reflection and after a few moments whispered, &quot;I am a girl. I am Madison McKenna,&quot; and liking how it sounded to say this, to admit it, feeling as if she was being truthful with herself, as if a weight had been lifted, she repeated it a little louder before smiling. Turning on the tap, she reached toward the soap dispenser, for some paper towels, and cleaning herself up, she debated on whether she ought to tell of what she no longer had down below and who.</p>
