<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wondering what she would be, Janet decided she was tired of being a loser. Instead...she could be a star! A famous pop idol, beloved by fans all across the world! Her cheerful personality and incredible talent would ensure not only her popularity and success but also her happiness as well. That would be her ticket out of this dreary life.  She imagined herself as a pop idol she wished to be, and suddenly the amulet began to shine!<br />
<br />
Janet was a little surprised. She wasn&#39;t an idol just yet! However, she had definitely changed a little bit. She became a little bit thinner, and her stockings and shoes changed. They looked like part of a costume or something. Her hair also changed color a little bit, and got longer as well. “Well, the amulet was working...” she said in glee, as she couldn&#39;t wait to be a pop idol!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s shirt turned black. She felt it get a little bit shorter, and then noticed that it was much tighter than before. She felt around, and realized her breasts had gotten slightly bigger! Meanwhile, her hair changed color, getting a little bit darker. While she was a little embarrassed, she had to admit she didn&#39;t mind having a little bit bigger breasts...<br />
<br />
Janet began to change much more now! Her shirt disappeared, leaving only her bra, which showed that her breasts had gotten bigger again! Her hair changed colors yet again, becoming a light gray. Her skirt changed, becoming black and blue and looking incredibly frilly. Her face became thinner and more beautiful, while her eyes changed, becoming a brilliant blue. She was embarrassed to see herself nearly naked...but she couldn&#39;t help but think she was really pretty! “This is wonderful!” she said as she sees the changes in the mirror, “I’m liking this direction so much.  In fact, I feel so happy I could...sing?”  Rubbing her throat, she could tell that it sounded a little older, but there was a bit of a synthesized feel to it.  It was almost like it sounded a bit robotic but with emotion.<br />
<br />
An intricate black and blue shirt appeared on Janet, fully open and still exposing her bra. Still, she felt more comfortable that way. Her hair got a little bit longer, and changed colors yet again, becoming a light purple this time. She couldn&#39;t help but feel happy now! She was famous after all...right? She completed a small little dance, and then made a cute pose. It felt so natural, almost like she got the moves down without missing a beat.  But she knows how to dance and sing since she really was an idol, wasn&#39;t she!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s hair turned a striking blue, and grew even longer! Her shirt began to button itself up, though it still exposed her midriff. Long, intricate sleeves appeared on her arms, as well as black gloves. She was truly dancing in happiness now; she had a big concert to prepare for! She loved going on stage, it was so much fun! She couldn&#39;t help but smile. Still, she had a dress rehearsal today, so she had to finish getting dressed!<br />
<br />
Janet was now fully dressed! Janet felt great in her full idol costume! She had a lot, but this one was her favorite. Her clothes felt surprisingly comfortable, despite being frilly and complex. Her hair was little bit lighter now, and was made into two long braids. She loved putting her hair in those braids; it made it easier to dance and crowds loved it. She put on her headset and microphone and tests it to see if it works.  “Testing, testing, 1 2 3.”  Hearing her own voice, it sounded too artificial, yet lovely.  A small black hat appeared on her head, and she thought it looked perfect! Yet looking at the mirror, she noticed that her attire looked incredibly familiar.  “Huh…  That’s weird…” she said in her vocalized voice, “I sound and look just like Hatsune Miku’s friends when I head to the concert.”<br />
<br />
It was a known fact that Janet was a big fan of Hatsune Miku and the vast characters of Vocaloid.  It was her favorite music to help get away from life in the outside world.  In fact, when she was visualizing herself as a pop idol, she visions herself as a Vocaloid with the name of Jay Jay and specializes in pop and dance.  Looking to herself, she could tell that she was turning into her own character.  Almost like a dream come true.<br />
<br />
As she was looking to herself, the world around her swirled and altered to fit her new life.  She could even feel herself getting digitized and felt like she’s in virtual reality.  As soon as the world finished altering, she realized that she on the stage with a live band around her.  She could even feel herself projected on a glass wall and was shown in front of a large audience within a huge stadium.<br />
<br />
“Jay Jay!  Jay Jay!  Jay Jay!  Jay Jay!”<br />
<br />
She could hear the audience chanting her name as the band started to play.  A smile came up to Jay Jay’s face as she was living her dream, her life.  She’s now the pop star she wanted to be.  Opening her mouth, she took a deep breath and began to sing.</p>
