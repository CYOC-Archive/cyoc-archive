<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick and Cameron were walking back toward the counselor cabins from the activity they had been supervising, an arts-and-crafts lesson where they taught some of the older kids all about figure drawing. Naturally, Cameron had been the model, striking all the goofiest poses he could think of for the little critters to draw, while Patrick had done his best to keep everyone focused and working their hardest. It had been tough, since neither of them were the greatest artists in the world, but the kids could tell they were trying their hardest and didn’t give them too much trouble.<br />
<br />
On the way back, they spotted two campers sitting on the playground, which was empty except for them. Patrick recognized the tabby who he’d talked to earlier, and took a wild guess and assumed the skunk next to him was the person he’d admitted to having a crush on. They were gently swinging back and forth on the swings, chatting happily and getting to know each other in the short break they had before dinnertime. However, as Patrick looked closer, there was something about the skunk that seemed familiar as well… something that filled him with a deep sense of regret, like he’d hurt the poor kid sometime in the past.<br />
<br />
“Looks like what you said before helped, Pat,” Cameron murmured to his roommate, breaking his concentration. “You’re a regular cupid, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, I guess… Just don’t say it like that. I was just doing the adult thing and offering some advice,” Patrick said, despite feeling really happy for the little cat. He tried to shake off the feeling of regret he felt about the skunk boy, then grabbed Cameron’s hand and pulled him down the path toward their cabin. “Come on, let’s give them a little privacy.”<br />
<br />
Elliot and Liam watched the two counselors jog off into the distance, and the two boys let off a sigh of relief. All they had been doing was having a friendly chat about Liam’s basketball experience; he’d been playing on a local team for a couple months, and was hoping he could make it onto the school team once he got into high school next fall. However, even this innocent conversation felt so intimate to the two new friends, and they had clammed up whenever they saw anyone coming near.<br />
<br />
But, for now they were all alone.<br />
<br />
Sensing his chance, Elliot took the plunge and did the filthiest, dirtiest thing his newly innocent self could think of; he reached out and gently grabbed Liam’s paw in his own. “Umm… Liam? I’ve been seeing you around the camp, and I really do think you’re cute…” he said. The old Ellen would have already started with the come-ons and flirting, but all little Elliot could do was speak his honest feelings. “I-I guess I already said that, huh? Sorry.”<br />
<br />
Liam smiled and tightened his grip on Elliot’s paw, his big tail wagging happily behind him. “It’s okay, I think you’re cute, too,” he said, then he had a sudden flashback to a vague memory of some other boys laughing at him on the bus, unable to tell exactly who they were or even when it had happened. He felt his breath catch in his throat, feeling suddenly ashamed of holding onto another boys’ hand and nearly pulling away.<br />
<br />
Elliot could tell that something was bothering Liam and wanted to help. He licked his lips, then he nervously leaned over and lightly kissed the skunk on the cheek, more chaste and innocent than any kiss Ellen had ever given in her life. “Liam, I really like you. If you get onto the basketball team next year, I’ll be your biggest fan in the world, I promise,” he said. “Umm… if you want, I could ask my big brother to have his friends give you some pointers? They play basketball at college, and they’re really good!”<br />
<br />
Liam felt himself starting to tear up in happiness hearing that. Even when he’d been a star batter in college, he’d never really had a fan before. But, the cute tabby holding his hand obviously adored him. Who gave a shit what the other guys thought? He had the best, cutest fan in the world, and that’s all that mattered to him.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Elliot! I’d love that!” he said, then he took the plunge as well and leaned over and planted a kiss right on Elliot’s lips, making a sudden purr rise up in the embarrassed boy’s chest. Elliot’s tail stood on end for a few seconds before relaxing.<br />
<br />
Elliot blushed, but continued to hold on tight to Liam’s paw. “Umm… W-we should probably get to dinner,” he suggested. “My big brother’s running the line today, and he promised he’d sneak me a special treat from the kitchen when nobody was looking… Want to meet him?”<br />
<br />
Liam grinned and nodded, and together the two boys ran off toward the mess hall as the sun started to set over the camp, and a warm breeze blew past them, through Soren&#39;s office, then finally into the cabin where Patrick and Cameron were relaxing before dinner.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Cameron was laying down on the bunk, while Patrick was taking a chance to fix himself up in the mirror before dinner. The gentle breeze blew through the curtains, and Patrick could almost swear that he heard the words, ‘<i>not bad, keep going</i>’ on the air.<br />
<br />
He frowned, then turned back to the mirror before suddenly feeling disoriented, like the floor was falling out from beneath him. He blinked his eyes a couple times, feeling like his head was spinning, and could swear he looked a little… taller? Maybe only a few inches, but still a noticeable gain. And he wasn’t just taller, but a little stronger as well. His arms and legs were still skinny and slim, but they had suddenly become strong with lean muscles, giving him the slim physique of a dancer or a gymnast. His ass was still fantastic, of course, but looked even better with his powerful legs to complement it. Even his hair looked more handsome, having restyled itself into a trendier, layered medium-length crop that was pulled back into a cute little ponytail. Finally, his glasses had been swapped out with a designer brand, and the prescription seemed a little less strong, making his eyes look much cuter behind them.<br />
<br />
Earlier that day, his look had wavered between ‘twink’ and ‘nerd’, but with the new changes he definitely fell into the ‘twink’ category, and a really cute one at that. As he gaped at his new look, experimentally running a slender paw over his more powerful arm, he almost thought heard another whisper on the wind.<br />
<br />
<i>Enjoy. Don’t make me regret it.</i></p>
