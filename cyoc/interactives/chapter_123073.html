<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jill&#39;Lith did her best to monitor things with regard to the meme she&#39;d been urged to spread. The new world was one that was rather interesting, mostly in the contrasts. While she couldn&#39;t personally say she liked the Baby Furs, from what she&#39;d been able to find out about them based on the news programs that reported on their &quot;advances&quot; was interesting in how creatures so like the Imps of her world could operate in such away and survive. The humans in her world had resisted Princess during her rise, and many paid dearly for doing so. In this, every Imp understood that any open attack would invite a violent response, likely in fear.<br />
<br />
Yet, the Baby Furs had seemed to get around this in a way that was most unlike the Imps in their world. In their world, the Imps were simply able to heal and delighted more violent actions, which in turn spread their corruption of that world under Princess. However, the Baby Furs simply seemed to be immune to violent acts. Weapons of war or even terrors of nature seemed to unnaturally become harmless and while Baby Furs did seem to maintain a police and military force, their equipment wasn&#39;t much more than a super soaker. They&#39;d never kill anything or anyone that way, but yet they&#39;d continued to expand their domain and their presence was creating a barrier that Princess had felt when her own powers had stretched out to feel into the existence of the other worlds. <br />
<br />
The Baby Fur&#39;s world had provided a very tempting target, and one to try new tricks. But the problem was the Baby Furs, themselves, their mere presence was magical in nature, just as the Imps were, and that presence was actually fortifying the barriers between the Baby Fur&#39;s world and the Imp&#39;s world. Princess had noticed this, particularly as when this world was discovered, the Imps had been in middle of what amounted to a &quot;birthday party&quot; for Princess, though it wasn&#39;t her actual birthday, merely just another holiday where Princess delighted in her Imps giving her things and beating them if they didn&#39;t. However, Princess did get around to looking into a new world to corrupt, not even her powers could easily open a portal to it. Something was fortifying that world, and ultimately it had taken nearly all of the Imp&#39;s combining their powers with Princess just to get a portal big enough for Jill&#39;Lith to slip through.<br />
<br />
Once in the new world, Jill&#39;Lith learned many things. Some were by observation while others were by trial and error. The first thing was the existence of the Baby Furs and that as their population spread, their magic seemed to radiate out across the planet. They hadn&#39;t converted the whole planet, only about 25% of the US, 15% of the Caribbean, 15% of Mexico and the Latin American states, 7.5% of Canada, 17% of South America, 19% of Europe, 10% of Africa, 12% of Asia, and 5% of Australia. And most of the areas they hadn&#39;t gotten to was more due to the inhospitable natures of the regions and that Baby Furs generally clung to the same towns they&#39;d lived in before. Most of their &quot;travel&quot; and thus the source of their spreading was simply the desire for a friend or that they had been on vacation in the area where the Baby Furs first appeared and returned home. Regardless of how they spread, Jill&#39;Lith could feel the baseline magical energy that the Baby Furs gave off, and it felt as the same energy that Princess had discovered was blocking her attempt to send her hordes in to corrupt the planet. In this, it was clear that the Baby Furs WERE the barrier, and Jill&#39;Lith figured while most Baby Furs didn&#39;t realize they carried a low baseline magical signature, they DID serve as that barrier and that SOMEONE had to have consciously created them. Nothing in Princess&#39;s world went right by accident.<br />
<br />
However, much of what Jill&#39;Lith knew about the Baby Furs was based on what she could see on the news. There was some things that she could sense, but that didn&#39;t tell everything. She had needed some form of information gathering that would allow her to learn more about the Baby Furs and their world. The best source had so far been the televised news which seemed to cover the activities of Baby Furs almost constantly, some fearful, some perplexed, some sensational, and rare ones that were sort of neutral. In getting to the ranch house that she was presently watching the television news at, she had also come across other factors that really had the potential to be the problem for the Imps.  That was something that Jill&#39;Lith knew that Princess wouldn&#39;t like.<br />
<br />
The big thing was that Princess&#39;s world and the Baby Fur&#39;s world seemed to be totally different versions of the same world, but as a result, many of the things that were possible and easy in one world likely wouldn&#39;t work in the other. She&#39;d found that she was able to directly to kill a horse and turn it into a gaunt puppet that had carried her to the ranch house, which in a sense made sense. That was a standard part of the powers that any Imp wielded, but she&#39;d found that it ONLY worked in direct contact and one at a time. In Princess&#39;s world, she could have done that to a whole herd of horses from as much as a mile away. The &quot;innocent malice&quot; that governed Princesses&#39; world allowed for that extensive amount of corruption. Here, however, if she were to do that, she HAD to get close enough to make physical contact and could only do it to one at a time... and something in her senses seemed to indicate that that ability would grow weaker as more and more Baby Furs were created.<br />
<br />
This knowledge made Jill&#39;Lith realize that some of Princess&#39;s plans for &quot;conquest&quot; weren&#39;t going to be practical. There was too much of a universe difference that simply wouldn&#39;t allow a lone Imp to really get the ball rolling. Perhaps if there were many Imps, but again, the barrier was growing stronger, and while it&#39;s strength wasn&#39;t growing as quickly, it was still growing here and there. That left her with two options, one would be to try and put another of the sort of corruption spells into something that the humans of the Baby Fur&#39;s world would respond to and would be corrupted by it, thus becoming Imps and throwing enough local Imps into the picture that the world difference would be negated and fully open the door for Princess to invade and the other was try her tactics with people and one at a time corrupt them, just as she had the horse.<br />
<br />
She had wanted to try the first when she first rode up to the ranch house. It was small and on a remote piece of land surrounded by cactus and other desert plans, though a lot of it looked like it was deliberately planted. She paid no worry to that and walked right into the home through its backdoor. Unfortunately, she&#39;d found no one to be home. The home was furnished with a television, phones, a computer, and the internet, but no one was there when she arrived. Either the owner was at work or for some reason was otherwise away from home. Regardless, she&#39;d made herself at home and then set about the second option with the planned meme prank.<br />
<br />
The idea was pretty standard, and fit with what had worked elsewhere. It would curb the movement of the Baby Furs and thus stop their expansion and might even fuel the negative feelings that would help Princess cross over. This, however, had only been a small portion of the tests Jill&#39;Lith wished to run. Attached to the meme was a set of specialized curses that had worked in Princess&#39;s world. Jill&#39;Lith was a bit skeptical, as many other elements of her powers didn&#39;t work in the Baby Fur&#39;s world... or at least not in the way that would be expected, but she did have to test and see what the limits of her power were. So, she&#39;d set up the meme as a means to block the Baby Furs and hopefully and transform the humans into Imps and then moved to watch the news. If her plan worked, the news would rapidly report on the appearance of Imps and how they were different from the Baby Furs and likely how they were working together, which would further Princess&#39;s plans. If not, there wouldn&#39;t be that many other options...<br />
<br />
As she watched the news through the day, her meme was reported on as having some successes in stopping the advances of the Baby Furs, which made her smile in that the chief aim of the prank was working. However, that seemed to be about the only thing that was working. She didn&#39;t feel any great increase in negative energy that would indicate someone becoming an Imp and neither did the new report on it. That wasn&#39;t so good, and gave Jill&#39;Lith the impression that the plans and tactics intended to corrupt large groups on masse wasn&#39;t going to work, likely as the Baby Fur&#39;s world wasn&#39;t going to allow it because of its difference from Princess&#39;s. Maybe they could corrupt someone one at a time, but that would still be a limitation on her, and so long as more Baby Furs kept appearing, even that loop hole that she could exploit in this world might not last long before it was also lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real question... is whether or not to tell Princess,&quot; Jill&#39;Lith thought to herself.</p>
