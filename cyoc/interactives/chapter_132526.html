<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
As you reached for the door handle, about to enter Daryl&#39;s Gen&#39;ril Store, two scruffy-looking young boys racing down the sidewalk suddenly crash right into you, nearly knocking you off your feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry &#39;bout that, Mister,&quot; the older one shouts with a heavy farm accent, grabbing ahold of your arm with his dirty hand.  &quot;Me and Cody was jus&#39; racin&#39; outta the holler an&#39;, an&#39; I&#39;s done beat &#39;em, again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you din&#39;t!&quot; the younger kid--obviously his brother--whines, looking up at you with his dull gray eyes and puppy-dog expression.  &quot;I calls inner-ference, Chuck!  Y&#39;ain&#39;t no fair ya dang cheater-skeeter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s okay,&quot; you say, chuckling from the two young kid&#39;s ratty appearance and accents.  You pull your arm out of the older kid&#39;s grip and take a few steps back to avoid smelling them.  They both radiate a strong sweaty and dirty stink you&#39;d rather avoid.  &quot;I&#39;m thinking you two were tied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tole ya&#39; so, Chuck,&quot; the younger one says, moving right beside you and snaking his arm under your&#39;s.  &quot;Ma says y&#39;always bein&#39; a dang cheater-skeeter!  Jus&#39; cause you is almos&#39; a year&#39;s older an&#39; bigger &#39;n me don&#39;t rightly mean you&#39;s smarter n&#39; me!  Ain&#39;t I right, Mister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, ya, sure,&quot; you say, unsuccessfully trying to pull your arm from the young kid&#39;s sweaty hold.  &quot;If that&#39;s what your Ma says, then ... yeah, she must be right I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the kid latched onto your arm, you suddenly have a thought.  You were in fact in this part of the state to research the bizarre tale you&#39;d overheard the cute blonde guy in your history class talking about. You&#39;d listened to Scott Jones&#39; intriguing story about his missing younger brother, Colby or Colin-something, and their farming family&#39;s weird neighbor-lady practicing Witchcraft or Black Magic spells to summon her family back from the dead.<br />
<br />
But you could sure use her help to hook you up with the straight hunky blonde guy at school.<br />
<br />
You were also writing your required college thesis about Witchcraft in Modern America: The Farmland Connection, but after a full month of hearing refusal after refusal from the farmers in town, you were feeling desperate to learn something about her.<br />
<br />
Maybe these two skinny farm kids knew something and could help you figure it out so you could get back to your dorm room.<br />
<br />
You needed to finish your thesis before your parents found out you&#39;d skipped a full semester of classes to find out what had really happened to that cute straight blonde guy&#39;s little brother Colin, while investigating some farmers for your thesis.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, your parents were at one of their lakeside villas in Europe, so your tuition was paid up until the next semester&#39;s bill arrived sometime around your 21st birthday, in January.  They wouldn&#39;t even notice you had skipped a semester of classes for several months, or until the November or December holidays, if at all.<br />
<br />
You studied the two lanky boys, guessing them at 10 and 11-years-old, at most.  The younger boy clinging onto your arm was slightly cleaner smelling than the thin taller kid, but it still made you cringe when he&#39;d pressed his sweaty head beneath your arm.  You were a bit of a clean freak, keeping your hair washed and neatly styled, showering at least twice a day, routinely brushing your teeth after every meal.<br />
<br />
Dirty, and especially sweaty people, severely creeped you out.  And these two boys were dirty and sweaty, and they both smelled funny.<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t matter that they appeared to be inbred, with somewhat oversized ears protruding a little too far out from the sides of their head&#39;s, sporting equally shaggy mops of thick coal black hair that looked much too long and dirty to be acceptable.<br />
<br />
Whenever they spoke their accents made the words sound barely understandable, each sentence coming from spittle spraying mouth&#39;s that were too small, with big crooked teeth and goofy smiles that gave their dull gray eyes an almost vacant, dim-witted stare.<br />
<br />
But maybe they knew something about that Witchcraft lady.<br />
<br />
Maybe they could find that magic spell lady for you, and she could cast a permanent magic love spell for you on Scott Jones, or brew up some magical love potion for him to drink so he could become your boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; you began, and glanced down at the younger boy who was still holding your arm around his shoulder.  &quot;Maybe one or both of you boys can um, help me.  I&#39;ve been looking for information about a family that lives near here, well, about a woman really.  See.  She&#39;s alone now, since her husband, sister, and youngest child died, and her two oldest children went off to college.  Well, it just so happens one of her kids might be this dreamy blonde guy I want--I mean, a blonde guy I know who goes to my college.  He ah ... he has a 16-year-old little brother named Colin, who suddenly went missing right after he wrote all about this lady&#39;s magic all over the internet.  Seems like he and one of his friends found something a few months ago, but they&#39;ve both disappeared and haven&#39;t been seen or heard from since.  Maybe you two heard something about it?  Or maybe one of you saw them?  Colin&#39;s friend was Jesse Sampson no ... Jesse Sanderson, I think.  He was either 16 or 17, with bright reddish-orange hair.  And Colin&#39;s well, he probably looks like his older brother, blonde, muscular, real beefy-looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you spoke you&#39;d watched their blank and clueless expressions, but you&#39;d said your peace and asked both boys your questions anyway.  Judging their silence, you weren&#39;t even sure they understood your questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;askin&#39; &#39;bout that Maggie lady, right?&quot; the older boy asked, scratching and brushing oily black bangs up off his sweaty forehead.  He pressed his fingers under his runny nose, apparently sniffing them.  &quot;Ya, me and Cody knows someone named Maggie.  &#39;Cept nobody talks &#39;bout nobody else n&#39;less y&#39;all be talkin&#39; private like.  Folks &#39;round here says it ain&#39;t real neighbor-like talkin&#39; ta&#39; strangers n&#39; public, Mister.  Do ya&#39; likes swimmin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Umm, no, not really!&quot; you say, struggling to free your arm from the tighter grip of the young boy&#39;s hand.  His fingers had grasped onto your arm more firmly when you&#39;d mentioned Colin&#39;s name.  You leaned down closer to the kid, and asked, &quot;Do you know where I might find her, or maybe speak to her?  Look.  It&#39;s Cody, right?  I&#39;ll level with you.  I&#39;m writing my thesis, that&#39;s a term paper, and well, I need this Maggie to sorta do something for me, well, something for Colin&#39;s older brother, Scott and me.  Then I&#39;ll go and finish up my thesis before I start next semester&#39;s classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I know!&quot; the older boy exclaimed, and pressed his face closer to your chest.  He lowered his voice.  &quot;Me an&#39; Cody can take you there!  We don&#39;t know if&#39;n mama Maggie teaches too much &#39;bouts writin&#39; a thee-sissies, we ain&#39;t never had no proper schoolin&#39; an&#39; such, but we might rightly know whatever alls you&#39;re wantin&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, follow us,&quot; the younger boy Cody said, tugging at your arm as he grabbed his older brother&#39;s hand.  &quot;Y&#39;all needs only whatever mama Maggie says she needs an&#39; wants y&#39;all to have.  I knowed &#39;bout that collar, Chuck.  She gonna reward me soons we gets one more &#39;cause she knows I wants a dog.  Mama Maggie knows what you an&#39; me wants an&#39; needs the most.  That&#39;s why she gots to give me the first one we gone bring, Chuck.  An&#39; &#39;cause I still were the youngest, n&#39; she know I gone need some&#39;in, someone to pro-tict an&#39; watch over me forever n&#39; ever, Chuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you mind what he sayin&#39; none,&quot; said Chuck, slowing down and pressing himself awkwardly against you.  He&#39;d glanced down at your clean white Nike Air Jordan&#39;s, loudly clucking spit between his cheek and jaw.  &quot;Them sure are real purr-dee shoes you is wearin&#39;, Mister.  Me n&#39; Cody ain&#39;t never worn us no Nike before.  Maybe I&#39;d likes gettin&#39; me a purr-dee one or two of &#39;em, too, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, yeah,&quot; you say, trying unsuccessfully to turn away from the boy&#39;s overpowering sweaty stink.  You didn&#39;t like how he had suddenly stopped and was now gawking down the front of your new CK sweats.  &quot;These Nike&#39;s aren&#39;t the one&#39;s you could buy at Daryl&#39;s Gen&#39;ril Store, Chuck.  They&#39;re specialty ordered ... whoa!  Where in the ... where in the heck are we?  Guess I wasn&#39;t watching where we were going.  What&#39;s that down there?  It looks like it&#39;s a swimmin&#39; pond!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to ignore the older boy&#39;s almost obscene crotch stare, you glanced left and right at the dual mountainous ridge line of tall green forest rising up on both sides of the dirt path you&#39;d obviously been following with the two boys, suddenly realizing you were now completely turned around and entirely lost in a deep valley, walking toward some tiny little swampy pond.<br />
<br />
&quot;If&#39;n you wants to meets mama Maggie,&quot; the older boy Chuck, stated, reaching down and tugging the shoelaces of your Jordan&#39;s, &quot;then you&#39;s gone need to let me an&#39; Cody wear them purr-dee Nike ones for a spell, Mister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Wait!&quot; you shout, lifting up your left foot to stop the kid from tugging harder on your shoelace.  &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy growled, pulling off your shoe.  &quot;Aww, &#39;tain&#39;t like we&#39;s gonna run off on ya.  We&#39;s right here, Mister.  &#39;Sides.  You gots them stockin&#39;s on, &#39;course ... I never seen them funny squiggle-things drawed on no stockin&#39;s neither.  Lemme try puttin&#39; one a them squiggle things on ... oh!  That&#39;s one a them sticky sticker kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no they&#39;re ... ahhh!&quot; you shout, losing your balance and knocked off your feet as the boy lifted your leg and forcefully peeled off the Nike sock from your foot.  &quot;Hold up, yo&#39;, I-I didn&#39;t say--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wants me the other one!&quot; interrupted Cody, grabbing your right foot and peeling off both your right shoe and sock together.<br />
<br />
You struggled to stop the dirty little boy from putting your sock on his filthy foot.  But he&#39;d backed away and slid it on his foot so quickly--inside out and upside down--you knew it was too late as his older brother Chuck stepped in front of you and flashed his big crooked yellowed teeth, drooling cables of spit onto your upraised arm.  Damn, you thought.  The kid was drooling and growling at you like a feral wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, back off there, Killer!&quot; you shout, flicking the kid&#39;s splashing drool off your arm and pantleg.  &quot;Damn!  That was ... hey, come on.  You&#39;re spraying your spit all over me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mister,&quot; the boy cackled, wiping his arm across his mouth as another ropy string sprayed out his mouth and almost hit your bare foot.  &quot;I-I can&#39;t helps it if&#39;n I sometimes feel like I&#39;m still a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush up, ya&#39; dang blabber-jaw,&quot; shouted the younger boy, chuckling.  &quot;We should make &#39;im trade us all a his own purr-dee git-ups, Chuck.  I calls that nice n&#39; clean OneD top he gots on, &#39;cause I know them singin&#39; song words you learnt me, Chuck.  An&#39; ma done found yer own One Direction pick-sure book.  Hey, Mister?  Do you knowed all five a them famous purr-dee singer boys?  I like to be wishin&#39; I were famous.  A&#39;course, you can buy yer-self a &#39;nuther one of them 1-D shirts you&#39;s wearin&#39; if&#39;n you was ta&#39; like lemme wear that top you got on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ... you want my shirt?&quot; you question, shaking your head in disbelief.  Something was obviously very strange about these two young boys, and you were starting to feel like you were duped into following them, walking miles out of the town&#39;s center and lead to the middle of nowhere so they could try and steal your clothes.  &quot;If I were to let you borrow my shirt, are you going to bring me to this Maggie lady, or were you boys just tricking me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ain&#39;t trickin&#39; you none, Mister,&quot; the taller kid Chuck said, retying the shoelace of your stolen Nike.  &quot;We knows mama Maggie.  An&#39; if&#39;n you wanna meet her, alls you got to do is trade us them purr-dee git-ups you got on yer-self.  Me n&#39; Cody don&#39;t git ta wear such nice n&#39; clean things, &#39;cept &#39;n for a fune-a-rull, &#39;n maybe sometime we goes n&#39; use our sun&#39;nay fineries if&#39;n mama Maggie ain&#39;t likely ta sees us snickin&#39; out with &#39;em.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could barely understand the kid&#39;s heavily accented words, but you&#39;d figured out some of what he was saying, hoping you&#39;d be able to get your shirt back from the little kid if he didn&#39;t ruin it.  You were a closet-fan of the talented boy band One Direction, and a bigger closet case for cute boy band members, from the curly locks of Harry Styles&#39;s, to Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne&#39;s longer hair days, to Zayn Malik and the cute preppy-boy you looked so very much like, Niall Horan.  And when you&#39;d heard about One-D breaking up some years ago, you ran out and purchased several OneD baseball caps, sweatshirts, tanks and T-shirt&#39;s, including the Tee you&#39;d been wearing since you woke up this morning.  It was unusual for you to wear a shirt for more than half-a-day once you&#39;d been sweating or getting dusty and dirty like you were now getting around these two sweaty farm boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you&#39;ll give me back my T-shirt,&quot; you said, awkwardly pulling up your T-shirt.  &quot;I guess it&#39;d be okay if I were to let you wear it for a little while.  I know you&#39;ll be careful, right?  I just hope I don&#39;t burn too quick from the sun, since I ... well, I sorta get sunburned super easy without wearing a shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before you had even pulled your T-shirt off completely, the little kid was grabbing for it, pulling it down off  of your arm and nearly strangling you with it as he tried squirming right into the same occupied sleeve your arm was still tangled and caught inside.<br />
<br />
Laughing from how oversized your T-shirt fit the young kid&#39;s thin scrawny form, you only just then noticed the older boy&#39;s struggle to get out of his overalls, exposing his naked, and surprisingly erect uncut 4&quot; long prick pointing upright from his hairless uncovered groin.  The boy obviously didn&#39;t wear underpants beneath his dirty overalls, and then you suddenly realized why he was actually removing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; you mumble, shocked from the kid&#39;s outrageous thinking.  You know he expects you to wear those filthy overalls he was removing because he wants to wear your sweatpants.  Or maybe worse.  He thinks you&#39;ll go naked!  &quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gimme them clean sweeter pants,&quot; the boy stated, and actually extended his overalls as if you&#39;d already agreed to wear them.  &quot;I&#39;s got a light red n&#39; a yeller one of them same kinds a sweeter pants at home.  &#39;Course, mine got a few wore rips n&#39; tears on both knees on the dull yeller ones I got.  Go on, take &#39;em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait, wait!&quot; you grumble, backing away from the outstretched arm of the boy.  You looked up at the naked kid thinking, no way, Jose!  That&#39;s not happening, and said, &quot;I can&#39;t wear those.  They&#39;re way too small for me.  They won&#39;t fit, Chuck.  But um, yeah, thank&#39;s anyways, but no, no thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knows they&#39;ll fit ya real good,&quot; Chuck said, and tossed his overalls at you.  &quot;Go on and put &#39;em on, Mister.  Then you&#39;ll feels good if&#39;n you does.  You still gots to meet mama Maggie, an&#39; I&#39;d git me a &#39;nother one of them sweeter pants, even if they&#39;s all purr-dee n&#39; ain&#39;t got no stain n&#39; no holes in &#39;em.  I knows you done wants to wear &#39;em now I reckon, holdin&#39; mine n&#39; all.  You likely gone be wantin&#39; to wear &#39;em without any undies, too, so if&#39;n you wants, Mister, I don&#39;t mind wearin&#39; &#39;em for ya for a spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You done jus&#39; made up a funny, Chuck,&quot; the younger boy Cody said, wildly giggling.  &quot;You says, what was it now, oh yeah, &#39;I don&#39;t mind wearin&#39; &#39;em for ya ... for a spell.&#39;  &#39;N he done wants a spell from mama Maggie, &#39;cause she can make spells, git it?  Spells?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck growled at Cody, drool spilling heavily from his mouth and over his chin.  &quot;Cody!  Hush your mouth!  It&#39;s already ... see it?  It&#39;s already doin&#39; somethin&#39; an&#39; he don&#39;t even knows it!  He&#39;s likely to fer&#39;git his-self sooner if&#39;n he jus&#39; goes n&#39; wears &#39;em.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt disgusted when the kid first threw his filthy overalls to you, but standing there holding onto them had a completely different effect.  You looked at them with a strange new thought about how good it might be wearing them yourself, that they might actually fit you.  Before you&#39;d realized it, you were handing your sweatpants and briefs over to Chuck and eagerly sliding his overalls on without caring that you had just stripped in front of these little kids and were putting them on without underwear, or even worrying about their filthy condition.<br />
<br />
As you&#39;d initially pulled them on you saw your bare ankles when the short pantlegs rose upward, but by the time they reached your thighs they felt larger and fit you much better.  As you buttoned the clasp at the waist, and zipped the zipper, even the built-in suspenders settled over your bared shoulders easily.<br />
<br />
Watching Chuck pulling on your underpants, tucking his large upright boner into them, you saw he now had a wild bushy nest of black pubes surrounding an uncut 7&quot; cock, and it turned you on when he began rubbing the noticeable bulging shape at the front of his crotch as he put your black sweats on.  You popped a boner looking at Chuck&#39;s stiffened hard-on and muscular slender teenage body, noticing he was obviously checking yours out from his own newfound arousal and ravenous teenage hormones.<br />
<br />
Both of you were now suffering from a bad case of raging teenage puberty.<br />
<br />
No!  Wait a minute, you thought, shaking your head, trying to remember something important.  You were a student in college!  You were almost 21-years-old!  Fuck!  You weren&#39;t no ... 16-year-old horny boy teenager!  What was going on?  You still remembered what had happened to your best friend and fuck-buddy Jesse Sanderson a couple of months back when you wrote a story on the internet about your crazy neighbor, mama Maggie Cooper, the evil magic witch lady.  She&#39;d caught both of you peaking into her window one night, and saying some big funny-like word at him right before your 17-year-old boyfriend Jesse starts grunting and snorting all wild and animal-like before he&#39;d turned into a stinky half-boy, half-bull looking beasty thing she still had penned up inside her barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!  Lookie, Chuck!&quot; Cody hollered, cackling like a coondog huntin&#39; possum.  The 10-year-old boy squeezing himself against you seemed more familiar now, playfully rufflin&#39; his fingers through your hair.  &quot;He done looks i-dern-tickle as you were when I took that collar off a you!  Even his hair is turnin&#39; all dirty milky white n&#39; such as your&#39;s was when you were Colin, Chuck!  Feels just like it, too, Chuck, like them soft n&#39; silky broked open cotton bolls out in&#39;na fields.&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard what Cody was yelling about, but you were unaware mama Maggie&#39;s magic spell on Chuck Cooper&#39;s overalls had already started to alter your memories and physical characteristics, changing your previous intelligence and personality into Colin&#39;s.  It had also recreated every aspect of Colin Jones&#39; original traits and prior physical condition onto your new 16-year-old perspiring dirty body.<br />
<br />
Unknowingly, and unexpectedly, Maggie&#39;s spell had also replaced Colin&#39;s teenage soul with your 20-year-old soul, and it&#39;d somehow accelerated Chuck&#39;s aging process, turning him into a 13-year-old teenager. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell&#39;s goin&#39; on?&quot; you shout, staring at the thin and unfamiliar arm you were extending to push Cody&#39;s hand away.  It now had a faint dusting of light blonde hairs on it, and you didn&#39;t know how or why your voice sounded so different.  But it definitely sounded younger and higher-pitched.  &quot;W-what happened to my arm and ... and to my voice?  It&#39;s ... different now!  It feels all funny.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even mama Maggie wasn&#39;t aware the slight spell changes she&#39;d made to their replacement overalls instilled soul-switching effects for each of her boy&#39;s first victim.  And she didn&#39;t know it had already caused her second oldest son and his victim to trade souls, aging Chuck so they would both have to remain on her farm forever, locked in a state of permanent adolescent puberty together.<br />
<br />
Cody&#39;s first victim would suffer an even stranger fate, gaining or losing years to be the other&#39;s 10-year-old obedient playmate and protective companion, in whatever form or type of creature--real or mythical--that Cody wanted his new twin and pet to be permanently changed into.<br />
<br />
What the Jiminy-Christmas-cringles was Cody telling Chuck about now, you wondered, reaching up and pushing away the younger boy&#39;s snotty fingers from out of your hair.  He was always funnin&#39; with you about sharing or wiping slimy boogers on you ever since you had met both of &#39;em years ago.<br />
<br />
No, that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on, you thought.  I shouldn&#39;t know both of them!  But I know them, and they&#39;ve known me for a long time, too.  Reaching up to fix your hair, you felt the different style and texture of it.  Wait!  How come my hair feels so dirty and spiky now?  And how come it looks so ... so white?<br />
<br />
Another memory invaded.  You knew that you and Chuck had been fooling around a lot because mama Maggie asked if you were willing to do all of them private teenage boy things with Chuck since he was always popping boners and discharging cum in his bed at night like a leaky faucet.  She&#39;s said she knew he was also one of them sissy-boy boys like you, too, and knew he&#39;d been fantasizing about all of them purr-dee famous singer boys he drooled over in that stained picture book she&#39;d found hid beneath his pillow.  But she also said she didn&#39;t mind if Chuck had sexual interests for boys instead of girls, especially since it was you he could learn it from.  Besides, she&#39;d explained, there weren&#39;t many young purr-dee girls available near her bull studding farm, so he really needed a willing and equally horny friend that could satisfy her growing boy.<br />
<br />
But you were more than surprised by the constant arousal and eagerness Chuck had ever since you and Jesse snuck into mama Maggie&#39;s barn and taught Chuck how to make each other&#39;s one-eyed snake feel like it were invincible.  And both you and Chuck had been equally experienced pleasin&#39; Jesse&#39;s bullish monster whenever he needed, and you and Chuck had spent many nights sleepin&#39; in each other&#39;s arms.  Course, Cody was always with you, too, sleeping right beside you two.  But he&#39;d quickly joined in once he learned how exciting a pumping hand made you and Chuck willing to surrender to almost all of his playful antics.  And then Chuck would always wind up beggin&#39; Cody for yet another sloppy and messy go around, again and again, sometimes endlessly throughout the night.<br />
<br />
Course, 10-year-old Cody was always the one instigating most of the other fun things you ended up doing with or without Chuck or Jesse even being there.  Cody was more interested in what came out of your one-eyed snake since his 3-inch peanut still only got thicker and stiffer without spurting anything.  But you were scared what mama Maggie might think about what you all were doing, terrified if she even knew what you were doing to the spoiled breeding cow she talked and sang to as if it was her missing slut daughter that she said left for college.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he gots buckets full a mama Maggie&#39;s magic inside &#39;im from your overalls, Chuck,&quot; Cody shrieked in an excited yelping scream, interrupting your memory flashback.  &quot;An&#39; it sure is lookin&#39; to be turnin&#39; him d&#39;rectly into the i-dern-tickle horny twin brother of Colin Jones, Chuck.  C&#39;ain&#39;t you sees it, Chuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sees it, I sees it!&quot; Chuck replied, his voice noticeably deeper, and sexier.  &quot;Jus&#39; let &#39;im be, Cody!  He&#39;s jus&#39; now gettin&#39; to feel it, too.  He don&#39;t rightly knows what&#39;s makin&#39; &#39;im get one, but it sure is makin&#39; &#39;im get a nice big stiffie for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An&#39; for me, too,&quot; shouted Cody, pressing his head against your chest and peering down into the overalls Chuck had you put on.  &quot;His snake&#39;s growin fatter n&#39; longer, too, Chuck.  I can see&#39;s it still growin&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
Completely aroused by the swelling boner you were now popping, Cody&#39;s mention of him seeing it made you even hornier.  That&#39;s when everything felt different somehow.  You didn&#39;t know what exactly was different, but you were definitely much hornier now.  And 13-year-old Chuck looked sexy in them sleek black sweeter pants he wore, &#39;specially with his long scruffy black hair.  You felt so dang horny now it didn&#39;t even matter that 10-year-old Cody was still peeking inside your overalls, watching your boner swelling painfully harder.<br />
<br />
And why was Cody saying you looked like Colin Jones&#39; twin brother when you were Colin Jones!  You didn&#39;t have a twin brother.  You had a 22-year-old older brother, Scott.  But why did your hair look so white, and why was it sticking up into spiky barbs as if it&#39;d become like some crazed porcupine&#39;s?  You wanted to see it better, and glancing towards the watering hole, you&#39;d realized how you could see it for yourself.<br />
<br />
Pulling away from Cody, you raced over to the water&#39;s edge and peered down at the surface, at the reflection of the young muscular sweaty blonde teenager with prickly white blonde hair peering back at you.  Gosh dang!  You looked unbelievably sexy now!  You were even sexier looking than your older jock brother Scott!  He was off at college, on some fancy wrestlin&#39; school-er-ship for basketball or some-such thing, so&#39;s he could get all a them hot lady girlfriends he was always bringin&#39; home with him.  This was even better than being .... uh, were you somehow an older teenager before?  You tried to remember but something else seemed sorta ... different, too.<br />
<br />
No, wait!  That&#39;s not right.  You weren&#39;t Colin Jones!  Your name was ... was, oh no!  Now you couldn&#39;t even remember your name!  But you knew you were almost 21.  You were in college, not a 16-year-old teenager!<br />
<br />
Turning back to look at Chuck, you saw the dark shadow flyin&#39; through the air an instant before it plowed into you, realizing as you splashed into the water that the shadow you&#39;d seen was Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the heck&quot; you cried out, rising up out of the showers of splashing water raining back down all around and over you.  Was, was your voice different now?  &quot;Ya&#39; dang gots ... me all ... wet!  What&#39;d ya&#39; do that fer, Chuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
And standing up, you groaned as your boner grew even stiffer inside your soaked overalls.  Glancing down inside them you saw your wet pubic hair suddenly changing from light blonde to the same bushy black jungle as Chuck&#39;s.  And as your swollen boner curved painfully upwards, it disappeared inside the new 7&quot; foreskin sheath that began sliding upwards around its smaller mushroom head.  Your muscular chest and abs were also changing, replicating Chuck&#39;s leaner 13-year-old body and muscle.  Oh heck no, you thought, shivering with arousal as longer dripping strands of wet coal black hair identical to Chuck&#39;s drooped downwards and over your forehead, settling onto your shoulders and the sides of your neck.  Looking over at Chuck, you realized you were now turned into his same own i-dern-tickle 13-year-old twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeepers-creepers, Chuck!&quot; you shouted, chuckling from the sound of your voice.  It could of been Chuck talking your voice sounded so young ... just like his.  &quot;Look what ya gone n&#39; done!  I ... I looks like you now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren&#39;t me!  I-I din&#39;t do nuthin&#39;, Colin!&quot; Chuck yelled, his dull gray eyes starin&#39; at you all eager like.  &quot;I were jus&#39; havin&#39; fun is all!  But I kinda likes it, havin&#39; me a-a i-dern-tickle twin!  Heck!  Don&#39;t ya wanna be i-dern-tickle twins no more, Colin?  I knows you&#39;s likes havin&#39; the same juicy tube a skin jus&#39; like mine down there!  You always likes it makin&#39; you hornier with the same stiffie boner as me!<br />
<br />
Glancing down to where Chuck was starin&#39; at himself, you certainly liked the upward curving uncut boner he had freed from them black sweeter pants.  His cock looked huge on such a slender young body, and peeling down the suspenders on your overalls, freeing your own duplicate uncut cock, you shuddered as precum oozed up out of its wrinkly puckered spout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Course I like us bein&#39; i-dern-tickle twins, Chuck,&quot; you said, giggling happily.  You especially liked all the same things Chuck liked to do when you&#39;s were both poppin&#39; stiffie boners.  &quot;You knowed ma said we gotta please &#39;em whenever we can so they keeps on squirtin&#39;, Chuck.  But I could sure use me a squirtin&#39; now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ain&#39;t no time for sharin&#39;, yet,&quot; Chuck said, tucking his boner back inside his sweeter pants.  &quot;You n&#39; me gots  more im-poor-tint stuff mama Maggie needs us to do &#39;fore that, Colin.  You knowed we gotta find Cody a new pet first, n&#39; maybe fine all of us a bran&#39; new daddy, too!  A&#39;course, I think mama Maggie is really wantin&#39; more n&#39; jus&#39; a daddy fer us, if&#39;n ya knows what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I knowed she does,&quot; you giggled, stroking your upwards curving penis several times before tucking it back into your overalls.  Soon as you n&#39; Chuck got all your chores done, you knew what you&#39;d be doin&#39;.  Then your&#39;s an&#39; Chuck&#39;s i-dern-tickle boner&#39;s might finally stop hurtin&#39;.  &quot;I&#39;mma callin&#39; firsties soon as we done finished all of our dang chores, Chuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine by me,&quot; Chuck chuckled, rubbing the bulge at his crotch.  &quot;S&#39;long as you be sharin&#39; I ain&#39;t got no matter if&#39;n I gotta does it first or last, Colin.  I&#39;mma guessin&#39; we&#39;s both gonna needs it more n&#39; once, anyhow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More n&#39; that dang horny bull gits it,&quot; snickered Cody, scratching at his unruly long hair.  &quot;N&#39; you knows mama Maggie ain&#39;t gonna want none a her boys left outta doin&#39; it neither, Colin, so, jus&#39; &#39;cause you two likes to be playin&#39; with them leakin&#39; boners together, you an&#39; Chuck better not fer-git about us all playin&#39; rubsies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t, Cody,&quot; Chuck said, and shivered with arousal.  &quot;Unless&#39;n a course, we goes n&#39; fines you&#39;s a bran&#39; new o-bee-dient pet fer yer-self to plays with t&#39;night, Cody.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Chuck hoped Cody could have a new pet later on tonight so he an&#39; his twin could play rubsies without Cody&#39;s influences joinin&#39; in.  It would get a lot messier, and a lot more fun once all of that college age guy&#39;s prior pleasures merged with Colin&#39;s weird perversions.  Chuck remembered being Colin before, and the effects it gave him becoming Cody&#39;s perverted dog.  He was still constantly aroused from it, and knew the older guy would even remember his prior life, eventually.  Not that it would matter any.  Colin&#39;s lusts would feel overpowering once they were transferred fully to his altered memories.  Then he would have all their combined effects, the dog&#39;s, Colin&#39;s, even Chuck&#39;s own newfound teenage horniness would all get rolled into Colin&#39;s thoughts, forcing him to suffer all them same i-dern-tickle cravings Chuck constantly had from a seemingly endless feeling of arousal.<br />
<br />
You giggled with almost uncontrollable excitement.  You and Chuck were now indistinguishable.  From both your oversized yellowed teeth, and your thick and unruly lengthy coal black mops of hair upon your head&#39;s, to even that pungent and sweaty boyishly ripe smell you both now permanently radiated.<br />
<br />
Strangely, you felt even hornier being Chuck&#39;s i-dern-tickle twin than you did as Colin Jones.  You knowed mama Maggie&#39;s magical gifts made you i-dern-tickle to Chuck.  You couldn&#39;t imagine being without him, or not being just like your 13-year-old twin brother.  Nothing would ever change that now, you knew.  You and him had become permanent relations for each other since mama Maggie wanted it, and so did you, too.  It were like magical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; You said, giggling at your strange new farm boy accent and new thoughts.  &quot;I sure does like havin&#39; me a same i-dern-tickle twin, Chuck.  Mama Maggie&#39;s done sure knowed jus&#39; what we both wants n&#39; needed, an&#39; I&#39;mma thinkin&#39; we y&#39;all should git Cody his-self a good ole pet soon so we can all have us a fine goes around laters tonite, Chuck.  I&#39;s reckin&#39; I&#39;s right, Chuck, right?&quot;</p>
