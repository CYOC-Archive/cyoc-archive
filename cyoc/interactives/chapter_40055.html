<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I must of dozed off. Where am I? Yeah, right, an other night of cleaning at UPS. Almost ten. Time to get my cleaning cart.<br />
<br />
Just an other night, just like the past twenty years. Clean the offices. Clean the restrooms. Sweep out the loading docks as all of the packages going in and out are processed. Shoot, I do not even have to think much while going about my rounds.<br />
<br />
After the shift, I am shooting shit with the others while waiting for my bus ride home. It is a good thing the route starts at UPS, there is always a seat. I have a hard time walking at the end off the shift. As always, I sit alone. Because of my big-ass ass, no one else has room to sit. And it takes me an hour to get home.<br />
<br />
Dinner, as usual is a frozen pizza. And I get my shower done jst in time for The Price Is Right. It took me a little while to get used to Drew Carey but now, I dream of getting on stage with Drew instead of with Bob. I enjoy my six pack and bag of chips while playing along. And finally off to bed.<br />
<br />
I notice that one of the creepy white supervisors keeps staring at me at the end of my shifts. I did not know that he was into big black women like myself, especially when he is going out with one of the skinny white women who works as a driver.<br />
<br />
Finally, the white boy asks me if I would like to go out on an off night. If an uptight white boy wants to get his freak on with me, who am I to say no. Sully says he will pick me up on Saturday.<br />
<br />
I actually dress up for this date. A big &quot;little black dress&quot; in order to show off all of tits and ass. I am giving him something that his skinny girlfriend does not have, a big ole booty.<br />
<br />
When Sully comes to pick me up, he keeps complimenting me about my huge tits and my big ole ass. He keeps telling me how amazed that a BBW like me can just keep moving and grooving while at work. I do not bother telling him that it is not so easy. It is just so nice to have someone call me pretty, even if it is just an other uptight white fatty chaser.<br />
<br />
We first stop off at an Italian restaurant where they had an all you can eat spaghetti deal. Sully insisted that I keep eating until I was full. I ate five full plates and drank two bottles of wine. The entire time, Sully looked so very pleased.<br />
<br />
A fine night of food and drink got very strange once the plates were cleared away and Sully and I were sharing one more bottle of wine. Well, the entire night, he only hade a couple of glasses. I drank the rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beulah, I will not go to bed with you tonight because I have already completely fucked you over.&quot; He is laughing as he says this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say whaaa...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to see what kind of stupid fat sow you have become. Damn but my aunt does great work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through my happy drunken stupor I could only ask,&quot;What the fuck you talkin about!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it, lard ass. Why would I be bedding you when I have my own fine girlfriend. You really did like her. After all all, you did go out with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You motha fucka, I never gone out with any skanky assed girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you do not remember Susan Paxon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan Paxon? Memories of sex and good times come flooding in. Only I am not the man in my memories. I am a very fat middle aged woman. And I am that man. I shake my head and mutter, &quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the the stupid pig still does not understand? Let me spell it out. The was a spell placed on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, bits of a different life comes in. One in which I am young, skinny, white, male and I have a girl friend. &quot;Susan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry. Susan is quite happy with me. And you seem to be content as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
I find myself too befuddled to say much of anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
I do remember. I nod my head yes and my heavy breasts are quivering because of my shortness of breath and by my body shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beulah, I have to say. I have never seen boobs shake like that before. That is simply the frosting on the cake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so fucking sweet. Here is the story. You were a man and you were going out with Susan. We were a couple before you started working as a driver after you graduated from college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait, I did not even get through high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;She broke up with me and started going out with you. One day, I was talking with my aunt about the three of us. She told me she had a way to make it so your old self never entered my life. But I wanted it so that I knew where you were at and that you knew what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember the delivery to Kim's Salon? She is my aunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am nodding my head so hard that my entire body is shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! While I am not turned on be all that fat, there is an enjoyment in watching your form shake. But back to the story. My aunt changed you. She added twenty years to your age. She shrank you down from five ten to five two. She gave you the gift of two hundred and seventy extra pound. And she made you black as midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
I now could remember the manicure and watching the mirror as I became me.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fun part was making you into a woman who would stay as a simple cleaning woman for twenty plus years. You are nowhere near as smart as you used to be. You were made functionally illiterate. That way you would never get through school and never pass a driver's test. You love to eat and to drink. It is easy to see how a person like you can end up being fat slob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; I whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about your life now. How many jobs are you qualified for? Now many men find you attractive enough to take as a wife. You cannot drive. You have to sound out your words like a six year old. You love to drink. You are the type who gave her all to hold on to her humble little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; I repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are not very bright anymore. I wanted Susan back. And because I never liked you, I wanted to have fun with you. With you being a big black bitch, I have all the revenge I could want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; not being able to think of anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I want you to know what you once had. Because I enjoyed coming to work with Susan on my arms, looking over at the old fat maid and knowing I have won. I watched you for the last week and never once did it occur to you that there was more for you. You are simple and content as you now are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I will become me again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sully sneered. &quot;Beulah Brown, how are you going to do this. You can hardly read and write. You cannot drive. Susan will never look at you twice. Aunt Kim will never change you back. And no one will ever believe that this stupid fat pig was ever a college boy. Who you now are is all you are able to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I had dreams...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And tell me what you most want right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quietly, I say &quot;To be on The Price Is Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sully smiled and said,&quot;I think we can get you tickets for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite my anger and confusion about who I was and who I now am, I am existed by the offer. I heaved myself to my feet and give Sully an ample bear hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mean it! You can get me on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, this promise over rode my desire to get my old life back.</p>
