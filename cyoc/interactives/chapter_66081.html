<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl strode over to the sock, and picked him up. He throws himself into Jeff's bed as he has hundreds of times <br />
before, but this time it's more special, as this time Jeff knows about it. Hell, Jeff can feel it.  Carl's <br />
cock strains against Jeff's face and Jeff's hands seem to squeeze Carl's butt as Carl bounces on the bed. <br />
Slimy precum stains the blue briefs, barely the size of a fingertip.  Jeff is revolted, but is unable resist <br />
greedily absorbing it. He wouldn't admit it, but it whet his appetite for a full load.  Then to his utter <br />
disappointment, Carl lifts his waist band and slips the cum sock down over his 19 year old manhood, and snaps <br />
the waistband back into place. Then he grips the sock clad cock through his tight briefs and begins <br />
masturbating.<br />
<br />
To Jeff, it's so surreal.  His body is bending and stretching in ways it shouldn't.  He tastes the dirty <br />
cotton of the sock.  It's almost like Carl is wearing the sock while he rapes Jeff's face.  But it's more than <br />
that, it's like Jeff is participating in Carl's masturbation.  He is repulsed and intrigued as his fingers <br />
seem to tighten and then release around Carl's tight ass, as the fabric of his pouch is drawn tight and <br />
released pulling the fabric from the back forward. Carl's glands begin secreting oils and scents along with <br />
sweat. Jeff finds the sensations intoxicating. He's getting drunk on Carl.<br />
<br />
Carl notices Jeff's room flicker as he jacks off.  Carl had set the reality modifications, such that Jeff <br />
would remain his underwear for two weeks before changing back, but he had reset Jeff's default form too.  Jeff <br />
was now permanently underwear which would change into a human named Jeff.  Jeff's mind retained all his <br />
memories, but other people would remember Jeff slightly differently - after all Jeff was no longer a real 18 <br />
year old man, he was now Carl's underwear masquerading as an 18 year old man.  Jeff's parents and siblings <br />
felt an odd pang of emptiness.  They still remembered Jeff as their son and brother, but his importance seemed <br />
less, as the Chronivac made their memories of Jeff phony, since Jeff had always been underwear in the new <br />
reality. Carly, Jeff's on-again off-again girlfriend, suddenly felt less enamored with Jeff.  After all, a <br />
person cannot feel the same way about underwear as they do a person.  Well, most people couldn't.  Max had <br />
always had a thing about men's underwear. His fetish had caused him to steal more than two dozen briefs, <br />
boxers, boxer briefs and jockstraps from the locker room.  He'd have taken more if he could have gotten away <br />
with it.  He had been in Jeff and Carl's class and lived in the house between them.  He had hung out with them <br />
a few times, but now in the new reality of Jeff as underwear, his memories shifted. He developed an <br />
inexplicable crush on Jeff that he had seemed to have had for years.  He recalled unsuccessfully trying to <br />
steal Carl's special blue briefs from his locker, while Carl showered. He didn't know Jeff was the briefs, but <br />
his obsession with Carl's briefs - the ones he wore every day for as long as anyone could now remember-except <br />
Jeff.<br />
<br />
Carl blew his load into the sock. Jeff could taste some of the filtered dampness.  He felt cheated. Sock got <br />
all the good stuff.  Then Carl ambled over to Jeff's bathroom.  The formerly wet sink, shower and toothbrush <br />
were now bone dry.  Carl had programmed the Chronivac reality to be that Jeff had been transformed into <br />
underwear after graduation.  Carl even found himself remembering both the false and true memories of that day.  <br />
In the true memory, he and Jeff had tipped back beers behind the gym after the ceremony.  In the false memory,  <br />
Jeff had been naked under his graduation gown, then Jeff had collapsed into his &quot;true&quot; form afterward behind <br />
the gym, and Carl who had been naked under his graduation gown too put the blue briefs on. He had worn Jeff <br />
ever since, except for brief periods while he washed and dried Jeff before putting him back on. <br />
<br />
Jeff was experiencing the false memories too, but his mind was pushing them aside.  He knew what had really <br />
happened, though subconsciously his sense of self was shifting.  How could it not?  He himself was now and had <br />
always been Carl's underwear in this revised reality, even if Jeff knew it wasn't. The old reality was the <br />
false reality as far as the Chronivac and the world were now concerned.  In time maybe Jeff and Carl would <br />
believe it too.  False memories are insidious things.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Carl tucked Jeff's waistband under is balls, raised the toilet seat and began to piss. Jeff <br />
could hear, see and smell the piss. He could feel it coursing through Carl's body and into his cock.  He could <br />
hear Carl's heart beat as blood coursed through Carl's veins and arteries. Carl shook himself dry, and snapped <br />
his pouch back over his manhood. The last drops of piss soaked into Jeff. He had never tasted another man's <br />
piss before, and he was disgusted.  But he also remembered vividly tasting Carl's piss for years, for as long <br />
as Jeff could remember.  No! His mind screamed.  That never happened!  Except it had happened, another part of <br />
his mind said softly, I've always been Carl's underwear.  In the twisted reality, Carl had gotten Jeff and <br />
Chronivac on his first day at his new high school.  Of course, he had known Jeff since they were in grade <br />
school, and he had considered starting Jeff out as Underroos or Power Ranger briefs, and changing him to fit <br />
as Carl grew bigger, but the Chronivac had age restrictions, and so instead he set it for the beginning of <br />
high school with false memories for everything prior. Jeff was his best friend in high school.  Jeff had in <br />
reality been his best friend since grade school, but now those were false memories.  All of it was false - but <br />
some were false memories of false memories and others were just false memories.  It was so complicated and <br />
confusing that Jeff's cotton mind was reeling.<br />
<br />
Jeff had only been underwear for less than an hour and he already felt like he had always been Carl's. Damn, <br />
he realized the bastard had had his mother embroider Carl's name into Jeff's body - er, waistband. Well, he <br />
was Carl's underwear, came the unbidden thought. It had only been an hour, he couldn't take this for two <br />
weeks?<br />
<br />
Carl stretched, and climbed under Jeff's covers with his half hard crotch buried in Jeff's mattress.  It had <br />
been a long day. He woke up humping Jeff's mattress. Jeff was excited.  For several hours he had been buried <br />
in darkness. Carl would move a bit every now and then, but it was so boring. Jeff tried to sleep, but he <br />
couldn't.  He wondered could underwear ever sleep or would he be conscious of his condition 24/7?  At last <br />
there was movement.  Carl's cock had softened earlier, but now it hardened, and Carl began to hump Jeff's bed. <br />
There were flashes of light, as Carl's body raised the blanket and sheets. The springs clanged.  To Jeff it <br />
seemed oddly reminiscent of a thunderstorm with lightning flashes, the sound of rain and thunder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, Jeff, you're soaked.  I haven't had a wet dream in ages. Guess, I'll be having more of them since I'm <br />
wearing you to bed from now on. I, mean, like I always have, brief boy!&quot; he laughed patting the wet spot on <br />
the front of his briefs.  He was amazed at how quickly the spot seemed to be drying and shrinking. Then he <br />
realized Jeff was absorbing it, and chuckled again, &quot;That's it brief boy eat it all up and maybe you'll grow <br />
big and strong or at least be Jeff again for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl dressed and went downstairs.  Jeff's family was just finishing breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Carl, did you sleep over again last night?&quot; Jeff's mother asked as she got up and went over to the <br />
toaster, &quot;Would you like toast and eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you make it a sandwich to go?  I have to meet Jeff at the gym later.  He wanted to go for an early run, <br />
and I wanted to sleep in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he missed breakfast again,&quot; growled Jeff's father.  The statement was more reflexive than anything, in <br />
this reality he had only one son.<br />
<br />
Henry, Jeff's older brother, caught himself staring at the bit of blue fabric sticking out above Carl's jeans.  <br />
Yeah, Jeff was out for a run, right.  Carl didn't know it, but Henry had known for years that Jeff was Carl's <br />
lucky briefs.  He had actually seen the transformation more than once.  At first, he was furious that Jeff <br />
would allow Carl to do that to him. After all, he believed Jeff was his brother, even if that was a false <br />
memory of a formerly true memory.  But after a while, Henry or Hank, as he was often called, grew jealous of <br />
Jeff's relationship with Carl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd think with all the time Jeff spends running and working out at the gym that he'd be more of jock by <br />
now,&quot; Henry blurted out.  He thought he'd like to be Carl's jockstrap at least once, while Carl and Jeff <br />
worked out at the gym. <br />
<br />
Carl shrugged, and thought of the appropriateness of the word jock in Jeff's case.  He suppressed a laugh, it <br />
came out as a snort.  &quot;Yeah, I guess, you're right, Hank, he should be more of jock.&quot;  He took the egg <br />
sandwich from Jeff's mother. He said, &quot;Thanks,&quot; as he took a bite and headed out the door. He nodded at Max, <br />
who was out in his backyard trimming the hedge, as he exited Jeff's yard.  Max stared at the blue patch <br />
flashing above Carl's jeans as Carl walked and his shirt moved up.</p>
