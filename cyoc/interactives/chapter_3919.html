<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And not noticing trips over the changed Johnny lying unconscious on the floor. He reaches out with his hands and manages to catch hold of the bed, his hands brush against some women's lingerie that had been strewn there. It gave him a massive shock, ignoring it he turned round to see what he fell over. 'Why is a grown man lying unconscious on the floor wearing small boys underwear', he thought to himself.<br />
As he wandered over to investigate, he began to feel a little strange, very light headed, almost passing out. His shoes felt loose and the could swear everything looked a little taller than when he came in, almost like he was shrinking from his 6 foot 2 inch stature. This was confirmed when he stepped out of his shoes as he moved and almost tripped over his pant legs, which were starting to pool up around his feet, the waist was also too loose and a few more steps and they had dropped round his ankles along with his boxer shorts, he stepped out of them too worried about what was happening to care about modesty.<br />
He was now too preoccupied with what was happening to himself, than the man on the floor, so wandered over to a full length mirror next to a large antique wardrobe. Ryan stared shocked at his reflection, he had lost at least six inches in height and was still getting shorter, but what shocked him most was his loss of bulk, he had spent years doing weights and working out daily to build up a strong muscular physique and they now just appeared to be withering away.  He ripped off his shirt to get a better look. Arms and legs becoming more slender, his six-pack was gone, just a tiny tummy in it's place, he was now very slim and waif like. All his body and facial hair had gone and his skin had become soft and silky. <br />
He had a niggling thought in the back of his mind of what was happening to him, as he stood there naked observing the changes in the mirror, because as well as the other changes, he noticed his hips now seemed much wider and more rounded than he was used to, and his butt much larger and more pert. His facial features started to change, becoming softer and more delicate, his hair spilled out of his head at an alarming rate, until it was down past his shoulders and touching his back. Then he felt a tingling centered around his nipples as they grew much larger and mounds of flesh started to develop underneath them, until  he eventually had at least C-cup breasts. A sudden quick sharp tug at his groin almost as if it were being turned inside out and the changes where over. There stood facing the mirror a most beautiful, petite, vision of female loveliness.  Not a trace of who he once was, was left, he.....now she was quite petite, barely five foot and very slender and graceful, it made him feel very weak, light, and vulnerable.<br />
The sound of other people clattering about in other rooms bought him out of his trance, and reminded him of his modesty, especially in this female form.  He tried to put his old clothes back on but they were so large and ill fitting on his changed body that they just kept falling off. He tried to open the wardrobe, but it was locked, no sign of a key anywhere. Then he noticed some garments on the bed, he wandered over, with a feminine sway to his hips, unnerved by the alien sensation of the flesh on his chest bouncing and tugging with every step. He reached down to see what had been left out, and was a bit dismayed to find there wasn't much there and what there was was very girly and feminine (a lacy pink bra, some matching panties and a pastel pink satin nightdress).  "They'll have to do", he said to himself, shocked at the high sweet sound of his own voice, but afraid of getting caught naked and a girl. He picked up the panties, what a nice sensation, he absently thought as the cool silk caressed his soft, smooth, silky feminine legs, they fit snugly against his altered crotch and they rested higher up his hips than his male underwear. He attempted the bra, but gave up on that after a few failed attempts and then slipped on the satin nightdress over his head, it felt much nicer on his skin and especially his now very sensitive nipples then when he had tried to put back on his old male clothes.<br />
<br />
Ryan suddenly remembering why he, fell over, walks over to the man on the floor. Then it dawns on him, it must be Johnny. He shakes him and tries to move him a bit, but he's too heavy for Ryan to move more than an inch or so, in his delicate female form. He resorts to slapping him round the face to try and wake him up. While also glancing down noticing how his body has changed, he has a physique even more muscular and fit than even Ryan's used to be. He is unnerved when while slapping him thoughts pop into his head about how handsome he looks, a rugged manly face and powerful muscular body, how he'd like to be held by those strong arms to just........and then.........."No, I won't think that", Ryan says a quiver in his voice. His body giving off  other signals, his nipples hard and a warm moistness building up at his new vagina.<br />
He spots a vase, takes out the flowers and splashes the contents all over Johnny's face.</p>
