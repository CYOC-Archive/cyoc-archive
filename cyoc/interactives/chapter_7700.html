<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stan could think of nothing more to say and with an affectionate hug given to Frank, Rachel and he walked outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stan I'm free, Frank took my place and you are....&quot; Rachel stammered out the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget what just happened, I can't yet believe it, yet we must get away from here before anything else comes true.&quot; said Stan as he urged her along.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile backstage Madame' was going over her plans for having the new French Percheron team sold to the Park's Hotel Limo service. It was maybe then when he new playmate Donkey wandered over.<br />
<br />
Nudge, went Frank's muzzle against Madame's tender hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to the corral and stay with the others, Donkey!&quot; she ordered but Frank continued to nudge.<br />
<br />
Turning to him she passed her hands over his tall ears and commanded him to speak his piece.<br />
<br />
Clearing his rasping throat the new Donkey could for this moment speak. &quot;Please Madame, I was almost this donkey once today, but an antidote brought me back. I offered myself as part of your show out of pity for Rachel, she was always a good kid!  I ask but for one thing and if you grant it I would agree to remain my whole life long at your side. I would show my gratitude by being far more willing while much more alert. If it would please Madame' spell me, curse me, do how you wish, but allow me to be a stallion proud and true! I plead that change me to a human minded and willing servant as an Arabian horse.&quot; begged Frank to be delivered from Donkeydom.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would make him more aluring to the audience!&quot; chimmed in Stephen.<br />
<br />
Madame' thought for a few moments as Frank stood hopeful and quiet. &quot;Willing I might understand, but alert, for what say?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taller and alert to danger's from where you might not expect, let alone the fact that I being of animal form would not be suspect as a guard over your safety.&quot; bargined Frank. &quot;One other fact come to mind, Madame', if I be an Arabian stallion proud and true the stud fee would be ten times that of a ruddy Donkey!&quot; again bargined Frank as his desire for rich sexual pleasures now made excellent sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree!&quot; said Madame' Illusia.<br />
<br />
Again she called upon the powers of darkness to do her bidding. A swirl of green mist whirled and roared louder than before as Stephen covered his ears and turned away from these powers.<br />
<br />
The mist suddenly flew in all directions as before Madame' stood a perfect and sound Arabian stallion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wowie!&quot; is all Stephen could say.<br />
<br />
The Madame' smiled at her most perfect Arabian stud. She walked around the 15 hand high horse. A flick of his still nervous tail and shaking the flowing mane Frank stretched his head forward to let loose a loud whinny of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Rachel and Stan sat on a bench at the rear of the paddlewheel ferry. &quot;Rachel, I want you to know that I never gave you up as drowned or lost. It was mostly Frank who planned our coming here as I did not have a car. I know for a fact though that if it were offered in any way he would have greatfully accepted being one of the Donkeys or animals kept here in the Park. Frank hated his life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel was in tears of thankful appreciation for Stan's coming and her breaking away. She hugged her brother as the ferry churned along.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can we do for Michael?&quot; asked Rachel. &quot;The Madame' told me that Mike was finally sold by Cedius after he'd tired of Mike and looked for newer pleasures. She said he was sold to the P.I.A.F.!&quot; asked Rachel.<br />
<br />
Michael, Stan had not planned on him in his rescue.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a goat, Stan, a big and hardy muscled male goat used for breeding more goats at the Pleasure Island Amusement Farm!&quot; stated Rachel sounding determined to go see her boyfriend again.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, but let's get out of here first and once on the road we'll talk of him.&quot; suggested Stan now worried about their escape.<br />
<br />
Rachel sat very quiet the rest of the trip to shore. Stan sat feeling the lake breeze and thinking of excuses for her home coming and Frank's disappearance.<br />
<br />
At last a possible excuse hit Stan's worried mind. He would plant Frank's clothes and some trappings along the lake frontage were they had planned to swim. If he told the Park Ranger that Frank drowned, it might work. The lake had a current running down to an electric dam project. A drowned body would be drawn in and ground up under the turbine blades never to be found again, it might work, it had to work! Oops, but what if after seven years Frank comes home being released from his Donkey duties, what then? Well he'd have to cross that bridge when and if it came, thought Stan.<br />
<br />
As the Ferry docked and those allowed to leave the Park disembarked, Stan and Rachel watched from above the long line of Donkeys, cattle, swine, and goats which were unloaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's the keys to Franks car, it's bright red and has two black testicles tied over the rearview mirror, you can't miss it! I'll go and ask about where the farm is and you pick me up over there, OK?&quot; asked Stan as Rachel gave a soft yes.<br />
<br />
Stan jogged to the corrals and sitting on the fence was the wrangler who he'd had words with earlier that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made it out! I'm surprised and sorry, I was of fond hope to have you in a corral tonight. I wanted to make your life a fun time, like what you caused me with yelling those stupid words to the Donkeys.&quot; grumbled the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, it won't happen again now that my brother is a goat! He was in the load sent just before this one and I'd been planning to buy him away from the Farm. Please can you give me the address, and I will go there and make the purchase.&quot; asked Stan.<br />
<br />
An evil grin spread the man's lips as he wrote down the address and map as how to get to the farm. Even as Stan stood watching the man write a nanny goat wandered near and nibbled at Stan's hand.<br />
<br />
Stan jerked his hand up, as the man laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, she's new at being a goat and her sensual feelings made her wish for companionship. In time she will welcome the bucks, but for now she would love it if you jumped the fence and fucked her plum nuts.&quot; suggested the wrangler.<br />
<br />
Stan felt Madame's curse of his body begin to effect both body and mind. A tenting of his pants front and then his shirt made the wrangler laugh all the more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, you didn't escape all the ways and means of your friendly Park. Go ahead, go on jump the fence I won't tell!&quot; beconed the wrangler.<br />
<br />
The nanny bleated as Stan became more and more uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;You might as well go in there your head is almost changed to total goat now!&quot; chidded the wrangler.<br />
<br />
Stan could stand the feeling nolonger as he leaped the fence in a single bound. The surge of beastial desire sent him into full satyr passion and with the laughter and jeering from the wrangler and his friends they watched Stan hump his first nanny.<br />
<br />
It was more than an hour later when the car door opened and Rachel let out a scream. In climbed Stan, his full goat head still atop his shoulders as thick ribbed horns curved and wrapped around his long and pointed ears. His shirt torn off and gone too, left a goat wool covered chest and back to be in plain sight of all near by. Lucky to have his jeans still the swaying long shaft of billy goat's pleasure poked out from under his belt. A part of his goat sheath snuck just passed the beltsline. Rachel sat and stared, Stan turned to his Sister and said, &quot;DRIVE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither people or Guards stopped the young lady driving the red car with a Satyr goat as passenger. Stan showed the address to Rachel and pointed the direction on his state map. So off they drove as the breeze calmed his passions and the human form returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do back there?&quot; asked Rachel after she'd driven many a mile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I went sex crazy and humped my first nanny goat!&quot; said Stan sounding rather upset.<br />
<br />
Rachel knowing herself the passions which rode over her and Michael just two years ago needed to ask nothing more. She drove the car with a vengence and in two hours turned into the Pleasure Island Amusement Farm entrance.</p>
