<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn’s jaw dropped when a handsome panda man walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Todd was buff as hell, torso perfectly formed into a ‘V’ shape, each muscle chiseled and defined, yet softened by the coat of black and white fur. It flared into a bubble butt at the waist and then continued down in what had to be equally impressive legs. A large bulge pressed tightly against the crotch of his jeans.<br />
<br />
Finn stared at Todd, who was scowling, one tooth poking from his lower lip, and began to giggle. He was <I>perfect</I>! <br />
<br />
“No fucking way! It worked!” Finn held a hooflet to his muzzle, trying to stifle laughter.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Jeff?” Todd growled, placing his hands on his hips. <br />
<br />
“What’s the hurry?” Finn asked, gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
“I’ve…got someone I wanna meet.” Todd looked away.<br />
<br />
“You want my dad to fuck you, huh?” Finn smirked.<br />
<br />
“And?” Todd adjusted himself. <br />
<br />
“Nothing. He’s single and lonely since mom died.” Finn smiled. “I’m sure he’ll be happy to have another man around the house.”<br />
<br />
“You think? Mike was acting weird about it.” Todd replied, and paused at how strangely familiar and informal he was being.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s because you’re Jeff’s friend. Hold on.” Finn punched in a few numbers. “There, now you’re Mike’s friend. Jeff should be out in a few minutes.”<br />
<br />
Todd shivered, his facial fur growing, giving him a short white beard. His muscles thickened and a bit of flab covered his body, softening his form and giving him the beginnings of a beer belly. With a gasp and a sigh, his anal ring loosened from years of being plowed by a big-dicked ram. The thirty-something, bulky panda shifted in place, expression growing more stern and mature.<br />
<br />
“Jeff said you guys have a Chronivac.” Todd said flatly. “Where is it?”<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“Your father and I are just worried you might mess with things too much. I work at Transdem, and these devices can really screw things up.” Todd said, expression and body softening as a gold wedding band appeared on his finger. The thirty-something became a forty-something, gut swelling into a small beer belly as the years took their toll. “We both love you Finn.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a little too weird.” Finn muttered under his breath, checking the settings. “Obviously, the end-goal, but this is way too fast.”<br />
<br />
“Whatcha got there kiddo?” The panda ambled over to Finn and rubbed his head vigorously, making his ears flop. “The Chronivac, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Knock it off, dad!” Finn grumbled, crossing his huge arms in front of him.<br />
<br />
He froze. Did he just call Todd dad? He glanced up at the panda and stared as memories of them hanging out all the time, Todd comforting him after his mom died. He was just a great guy to be around. <br />
<br />
No! Shit, that wasn’t real!<br />
<br />
“Hey, uh, dad…how would you undo a change once you’ve inputted it?” Finn asked, trying to sound casual and inwardly cringing when he called his step-dad...called Todd &#39;dad&#39;.<br />
<br />
“Err, I’m in R&D, not user interface, but you should just be able to click on a profile and there should be a drop-down menu with a ‘restore to default’ option.” The older panda scratched his beard. <br />
<br />
Jeff chose that moment to exit the bathroom completely naked. A cloud of body-wash smelling steam wafted out with him. Finn and Todd both looked over at the muscular young tiger. Jeff blinked at the two of them, an expression of confusion crossing his muzzle for just an instant. And then he relaxed and smiled, shaking his muscular ass and winking at the older panda.<br />
<br />
&quot;How ya doin&#39; big panda daddy?&quot; Jeff purred and walked over to his bed and picked up his clothes.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey pal.” Todd smiled at Jeff, eyeing his naked body in open appreciation. “I was just telling Finn here about the Chronivac.”<br />
<br />
“That’s…why I called you.” Jeff nodded, though something about this felt off. “For a minute there, I thought you were on our football team. Weird, right?”<br />
<br />
“I’m the assistant coach, so…spot on, I guess?” Todd grinned and patted his beer belly. “Gotta keep in shape so I don’t end up a tub of guts like Dave, heh. You guys messed with the Chronivac?”<br />
<br />
“A little.” Jeff nodded. “My dad wanted to be a tiger, so I turned him into one. Then I turned into one, too! Why’d that happen?”<br />
<br />
“Did he now?” Todd stroked his beard. “Can you bring up the log?”<br />
<br />
“Log?” Finn asked, a worried expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay, Finn?” Jeff saw the slightly panicked expression on his boyfriend’s face. “You didn’t do anything while I was showering, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, lay off him, Jeff!” Todd said, hugging the young ram tight. “He’s just as tempted as anyone else! What’d you do, give yourself a bigger cock to play with?”<br />
<br />
“No…not exactly…” Finn said slowly and pressed the ‘undo last change’ button. “I guess you’re about to find out.”<br />
<br />
“No we won’t. You have reality shift enabled.” Todd pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Lucky me.” Finn grinned.<br />
<br />
The panda tapped his foot impatiently, not noticing his body regress, fat melting from his abdomen, muscles reducing in mass. Soon, he was a young, fit panda again.<br />
<br />
“Lucky you?” Todd demanded. “I came all the way here with, like, half a gallon in my tank. Are you going to compensate me for it?”<br />
<br />
“Finn, lay off him.” Jeff crossed his arms. “Just turn off the reality alteration and change him. We both know it works.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Finn smirked and redid the original transformation, this time with awareness set to ON for the three boys.<br />
<br />
Todd swelled with muscle, spine popping as he grew taller. His clothes shifted again, showing off all his goods. The boy stared down at himself, flexing and watching his muscles pop into definition with each movement in fascination.<br />
<br />
“Good choice, bae.” Jeff nodded approvingly.<br />
<br />
Finn smirked.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I’m ripped!” Todd ran around the room and stopped in front of a mirror, running his paws over his torso. He paused. “But I remember being older. And…with Dave.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve always been young, I aged you up with mental shift on.” <br />
<br />
“Finn!” Jeff scolded. “That’s fucked up!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, okay! I didn’t even think it would work.”<br />
<br />
“Huh…so it was all just…fake.” Todd muttered, eyes sad and distant.<br />
<br />
“You okay?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“No. It was like…real to me, man.” Todd sat down on the bed. “I was so proud of Finn. And I was coaching your team…and we’re going to state! And…Dave…”<br />
<br />
“Bummer, bro.” Finn rolled his eyes. “Okay, so let’s start planning out next changes. Who else do we know or knew and want on the team?”<br />
<br />
“My friends. Chuck and Greg.” Todd said instantly.<br />
<br />
“Jeff?”<br />
<br />
Jeff paused, the white tiger’s tail flicked back and forth in agitation. “I’m not sure.”<br />
<br />
“You guys go pick them up and bring them in range.” Todd tossed them his keys. “I’ll stay here and make sure no one does anything weird.”<br />
<br />
“How are we supposed to trust you?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Because I know how it actually works. You guys did some real damage here.” Todd placed his paws on his hips. “You’re lucky.”<br />
<br />
“Lucky?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a <I>prototype</I>, Finn. It has bugs. This is product testing.” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“We could have….”<br />
<br />
“All turned into cockroaches or cats or god knows what.” Todd said. “Now hurry up and go. Does anyone else know about this thing?”<br />
<br />
“My dad. And he might have told Dave.” Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
“I’ll talk to them.” Todd assured him.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Finn took off. Todd waited for them to leave and then went downstairs. Mike and Dave were watching the game. It was almost half time. Dave looked up and grinned, the one that made Todd’s heart flutter in his chest. The one that made him marry…no. That was a fake life.<br />
<br />
“Where’d your friends go?” The meaty ram asked.<br />
<br />
“Going to pick up some new teammates.” Todd said, cock already hardening. <br />
<br />
“You…sure you’re okay with this?” Mike questioned, the muscular tiger looking uncomfortable. “I mean…”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Mike, stop being a stick in the mud.” Dave growled, annoyed.<br />
<br />
Mike sighed and shook his head. “I’m gonna go drop the kids off at the pool.”<br />
<br />
Mike got up and left.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with Mike?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, he’s just jealous.” Dave glanced to the hall. “Not much love in his life since his wife left him when she found out his…preferences.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” <br />
<br />
Dave grinned and patted the couch next to him. <br />
<br />
Todd smiled and plopped down next to the big ram. Dave immediately started feeling Todd up, hooflets running over the hills and valleys of Todd&#39;s muscular form. Todd rubbed the ram’s belly and made his way down to his thigh, rubbing the ram’s thick cock gently. They kissed, Todd’s cock twitching, a spot of pre blooming in his pants. God, Dave was so hot!<br />
<br />
Dave broke the kiss, the ram smirking and running his hooflets down to Todd’s groin. His cock sprung out of his pants, the ram unbuttoning him quicker than Todd thought possible. Dave stared at the throbbing ebony shaft, practically drooling. <br />
<br />
The panda felt the ram’s warm, moist mouth engulf his member and gently suckle on it. He moaned, paws curling into the carpet. Dave’s head game was on point. He leaned back and let the ram do his work.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Dave.” Todd moaned, like he’d done a thousand times when they were married.<br />
<br />
Dave pulled his muzzle off Todd’s cock quick. “What?”<br />
<br />
“Um...” Todd blinked, confused. “Did I say something wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you should wait for your friends back upstairs.” Dave shifted over to the other side of the couch. “Or maybe go home for the night.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand?” Todd asked, feeling hurt, his cock wilting.<br />
<br />
“He’s not interested in dating a kid, dumbass.” Mike growled, coming back into the room.<br />
<br />
Tod looked between the two, wondering what the hell was going on. It felt like the whole thing was a setup. Had…had his crush betrayed him?<br />
<br />
“Were you waiting in the hall?” Todd asked, getting angry. “The fuck?”<br />
<br />
“Out.” Mike pointed to the door. “I’m not in the mood to deal with teenagers.”<br />
<br />
“But Jeff-”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell him you had an emergency.” Mike scowled and grabbed Todd’s arm and pulled him to his feet. “Now get.”<br />
<br />
Fuck this.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay!” Todd ripped his arm out of the tiger’s grasp with great effort, shooting Dave a forlorn glance. The ram wasn’t looking at him. What the fuck was going on?<br />
<br />
He pretended to go for his shoes and put them on and then juked up the stairs, running as fast as he could. Mike shouted behind him, and Todd knew he wouldn’t have much time. He ran into Jeff’s room and slammed the door, shoving the chair under the knob.<br />
<br />
There was a pounding at the door.<br />
<br />
Pulling up his profile, Todd executed the last transformation Finn had done on him, making sure his memory of his old life would be intact. He set the duration for 1 day and hit execute.</p>
