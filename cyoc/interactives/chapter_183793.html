<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate’s perspective: <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe dad’s machine fucked up and now I have his body and his junk for an indeterminate amount of time. Can’t wait to get this dad pussy pounded,” He thought, getting ready to proposition Mr. Johnson for sex.<br />
<br />
He put on grey sweatpants with no underwear to fully show off his big cock. Finishing his basic but horny look was a mono color neon green t-shirt and a pair of grey sneakers.<br />
<br />
Hardly believing what he was about to do, Nate headed over to the Johnson house next door. He rung the doorbell.<br />
<br />
“Uh hi, what can I do for you,” asked the teenage boy who answered the door.<br />
<br />
Nate recognized him as a being Derrick Johnson, a man a couple grades younger than himself (16y/o sophomore). With how horny Nate was in his father’s body, even Derrick Johnson was looking like a snack. Derrick was 6’ tall and lean muscular from doing dance classes. He had dark black hair, a bit of acne, but a very handsome face.<br />
<br />
“Hi I’m Tom from next door, is your dad home?” Asked Nate.<br />
<br />
“He’s off on a cruise this month. Can I take a message,” asked Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Well if he’s off on a cruise then you must be a little lonely, huh Derrick?” Asked Nate, shamelessly being a horn dog.<br />
<br />
“You know my name?” Asked Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you go to school with my son Nate, a senior. He told me you’re really cute like your dad. Now I see he wasn’t lying,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
“Is this really happening? A dilf like you is coming on to me?” Asked Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we make use of your dad’s empty bed?” Asked Nate. He knew that Mr. Johnson was an only parent.<br />
<br />
Derrick should’ve been more cautious about inviting his neighbor in, but his hormones clearly ruled over his common sense. He led Nate through the house up to the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
Nate went up to the bed and felt a spot that was still warm from body heat. “Ohh, someone’s been using this bed anyway.”<br />
<br />
“Uh...yeah...It’s kind of hard to explain but I find it comforting when my dad is gone,” said Derrick, blushing at having been found out.<br />
<br />
“No need to explain,” said Nate, picking up a pair of Mr. Johnson’s used briefs off of the floor and taking a big whiff from the crotch of it, “Who doesn’t love the smell of man?” Nate offered the fragrant briefs to Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, I shouldn’t...He’s my dad,” said Derrick, who looked very tempted to bury his face in the briefs as Nate just had.<br />
<br />
“Come on, I’ve smelled my dad’s underwear before. What he doesn’t know can’t hurt him, like you sleeping in his bed when he’s gone,” said Nate. The irony was that not only had Nate sniffed his dad’s underwear before but he was now literally hijacking his dad’s body and Derrick had no idea.<br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right, it couldn’t hurt him,” said Derrick, who caved and took the underwear from Nate. He proceeded to bury his face in the crotch and inhale deeply.<br />
<br />
“See your dad smells great, probably why you like to spend time in his bed,” Nate teased. “I bed your cock and balls smell just as good.”<br />
<br />
Derrick blushed, “Well you don’t just have to wonder...”<br />
<br />
Nate took his cue and knelt down before the standing Derrick. He pressed his face into Derrick’s gym shorts clad crotch and breathed in the nice smell of male pheromones. He grabbed Derrick’s butt cheeks on the other side and massaged them while the teen ran one hands through Nates hair. The other hand was still holding his dad’s briefs to his face. Suffice to say his dad’s scent was more than a slight aphrodisiac for him.<br />
<br />
Nate got up and got on the bed, “Do you wanna fuck?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve never bottomed before...” said Derrick, assuming that the muscle god before him would want to top, and with that cartoonishly big cock that was visible through his sweats.<br />
<br />
“That’s not a problem,” said Nate, flipping over and showing his big manly ass. He took off the sweats and t-shirt he was wearing and started playing with his hole.<br />
<br />
Derrick couldn’t believe his luck. Not only did his hot af neighbor want to have sex with him, he wanted to bottom for him?? And that hairy hole/bubble butt combo he was presenting was perfection. <br />
<br />
Derrick mounted Nate, finding his hole to already be lubed from Nate’s first excursion in his dad’s body. Penetration wasn’t hard, as Derricks four and a half inch boner was smaller than the dildo which Nate had played with an hour ago. But it being flesh and blood made it so much better than that dildo. Nate could feel Derrick’s heartbeat  through his penis, and his length was still good enough to hit Nate’s prostate, which he began doing rhythmically.<br />
<br />
They switched from doggie style to missionary so that they could make out while fucking. <br />
<br />
Derrick was still intermittently inhaling through the crotch of his dad’s briefs as he fucked Nate on his dad’s bed. Probably imagining it was his father that he was pumping. The thought turned Nate on even more.<br />
<br />
A half an hour later, Nate started cumming. He rubbed his big hands all over Derrick’s smooth muscular chest and enjoyed his first orgasm in his dad’s body.<br />
<br />
Tom’s Pov:<br />
<br />
He worked as quickly as he could, not only repairing the swap machine, but making it so that it would work on former participants without them even being present.<br />
<br />
He had to stop Nate from using his body for gay sex. I mean, once wouldn’t be the end of the world, but what if Mr. Johnson started to expect it, or even worse, what if Nate started a relationship with Mr. Johnson, or another man? Little did he know, Nate hadn’t been able to get with Mr. Johnson and had settled for his son Derrick. They were headed upstairs together about now.<br />
<br />
A half an hour later, the genius Tom had finished the repairs/upgrade. He put in former swap mates as the targets and performed a consciousness swap remotely.<br />
<br />
Instantly Tom was back in his body, a bit dazed. He felt something slimy on his stomach. Was it his own cum? And what was that feeling inside him? Like a pressure going in and out. It felt so good a moan slipped out from Tom’s mouth, surprising himself.<br />
<br />
He looked up and saw someone who looked like the tall neighbor boy moving his hips back and forth. Why would he be doing that shirtless in front of Tom? His vision finally correct and saw what was going on. The neighbor boy was in his ass, fucking him! Clearly Tom had already cum and yet his dick was hard from the stimulation that he was receiving from the young man.<br />
<br />
 He was about to explain himself, and tell the teenager that he needed to remove himself from his ass when all of the sudden, the boy’s facial expression changed. Tom felt the young man’s hot splooge coat his insides, and Tom’s body orgasmed again, shooting a blank but feeling so good.<br />
<br />
Derrick went in for a kiss while still inside of Tom’s athletic ass. Tom didn’t know why, but he let the young man kiss him. Nate was in so much trouble.</p>
