<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the baseball game, Randy had taken Jared out for a nice long run around the neighbourhood.  He'd gotten a chance to meet some of the kids that lived there.  They played with him by throwing a tennis ball around.  It was surprisingly enjoyble to give chase to it and bring it back in his jaws.  But the fun and games did not last forever, despite his seemingly limitless reserve of energy.  He was brought back inside and left to his own devices while Randy made several telephone calls.  He listened in of course, and could hear that the policeman was setting up his registration and tags.  They'd all be waiting for him tomorrow at the K-9 training centre, as well as with a proper collar.  When Randy ws asked to give a name for the dog for the tags, he chose &quot;Sammy&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Sammy.  That was to be Jared's new name.  His dog name.  After Randy had gotten off the phone, he found his partner looking up at him curiously. &quot;What do you think of Sammy for a name, boy?&quot; he asked, leaning down and patting him between the ears.  Jared could not help but wag at the petting.  It could have been much worse after all.  Sammy.
<br />

<br />
Randy laughed and kept petting him, &quot;Oh like being Sammy!&quot; Randy chortled pleasantly.  Jared, to his own surprise, found himself rolling over onto his back, exposing his belly to the policeman, his paws sticking up in the air.  Randy laughed again and began to scratch at his chest and belly, a very pleasant feeling.  Jared let his tongue loll from his mouth as he panted, feeling quite content just then.
<br />

<br />
But it was not to last forever, soon afterwards, Randy went to his desk and studied over what looked like a case file.  He turned the computer on, and typed away at it for a while too.  Jared, with nothing else to do, explored the house for a while, but then came back and lay down in the doorway to the policeman's den.  His dark eyes kept a watch on the man.  
<br />

<br />
Eventually, Randy had his own dinner, some hot dogs, and he even gave a few morsels to his new dog.  This was followed by more TV, and then sleep.  Jared was glad when he was invited up onto the bed with his partner.  Randy had a double, so it was large enough for them both.  It was the best night sleep that Jared had had since becoming a German Shepherd, and he felt so comfortable, he had no desire to get up that next morning.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come on, Sammy!&quot; Randy's exuberant voice called. &quot;Time ot get up and go for a walk.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Jared climbed off the bed, feeling a rush of energy fill him as the new day dawned.  It was early, but not terribly so.  The sun was just risen, and the air was brisk, but carrying the promise of warmth.  Once Randy had him on the leash, they jogged along the neighbourhood.  A few other people were up, taking out the trash, or collecting their morning paper.  Jared glanced at them for a moment, but saw none of the kids he'd played with the other day.
<br />

<br />
It was invigorating to be outside and running.  But when a familiar urge came over him, he blanched.  In the pound, he'd become accustomed to doing his business outdoors, but there was something different here.  This time, his partner Randy would be watching him.
<br />

<br />
But there was nothing for it.  He stepped off into the grass, and hunched over, lifting his tail high.  Randy saw it and stopped, stretching his arms a little bit to get more feeling into them.  Jared felt a great sigh heave up from his chestas he felt his waste deposit behind him.  Stepping forward, he gave his legs a few good kicks to make sure nothing was clinging to his rump, and then came back to stand at Randy's side.
<br />

<br />
Officer Kempe gave his dog a good firm pat on the head. &quot;Good boy, Sammy!  Glad to see you are housebroken already.  You all finished up?&quot;  The answer was no, as Jared had to lift his leg another house down.  
<br />

<br />
When they got back, Kempe had some coffee, and gave Jared a milkbone to scarf down.  He did so, waiting for the trip to the K-9 training centre.  There was little else he could do.  Jared had never really understood how boring most of a dog's life was.  There was little for him to do except to lay around.  There weren't even any other dogs for him to compete with, as odd as that thought was.
<br />

<br />
But it didn't take long for Randy to get dressed in uniform and ushed Jared into the car.  They drove back through town to police headquarters, a large office building with several wings.  Randy parked and attached Jared's leash once more.  He was led inside past several other policemen.  Some of them even had their own K-9 partners.  Jared's nose followed the other dogs trying to sniff at them, but none of the humans allowed them any time to greet.
<br />

<br />
Randy finally stopped at a tan receptionsit desk, and turned to him, &quot;Sit, Sammy!&quot;  Jared di so, licking his jowls and staring up at Randy.  This was it, when he'd get his tags.  RAndy spoke for several moments with the receptionsit, and soon, she passed him a few items, including a slip of paper.  Randy smiled and knelt down, holding a brand new collar, as well as a little badge with the word &quot;Sammy&quot; printed on the front, with a series of numbers underneath it.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Here's your badge, Sammy!  Let's get this on you.&quot; Randy removed the old collar and slipped the new one on.  Jared sighed inwardly at that, his new identity being plaed upon him.  If somehow he got lost, anyone who found him would call Randy to come get him.  He was now legally Randy's dog, his property in fact.  And Randy was his master.
<br />

<br />
The officer smiled brightly and scritched him between the ears, &quot;Good boy, Sammy!&quot; Jared wasn't sure how to feel though, a part of him was sad, another excited.  And a third just wished to enjoy the scritching.  
<br />

<br />
But it did not last long, and soon, Randy was leading him away towards a larger gym-sized room.  Several other officers were there with their K-9 companions.  Randy went over to talk to one of his friends, and Jared and the other German Shepherd sniffed at each other.
<br />

<br />
One thing that Jared had learned was that dgos do not communicate in words the same way that humans do.  Instead, the things they have to say to each other dealt with dominance, pack position, of their place in things, and how they were feeling, and sometimes, what they wanted.  No higher concepts, just simple things that could be conveyed with body language and a few sounds like barks, growls, and whines.  This other German Shepherd was merely curious, and a bit eager to assert his dominance.  Jared stood his ground, keeping his tail high.  
<br />

<br />
When the two officers saw what their dogs were doing, they were pulled apart.  Jared was told to sit and stay nd he did so.  The other officer had to hold his back. &quot;Wow, you've already got your dog trained some, Randy,&quot; the other man said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, Sammy's a good boy.  Picke him up from the pound yesterday.  Not sure who he belonged to before, but he wasn't missed.  But Sammy is well trained.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;He's going to get through this easily then.  I'm going to be here a while I'm afrid.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sure it won't be that long,&quot; Randy said, laughing a bit.
<br />

<br />
But their conversation was cut short as anothe rofficer announced that the time for training had begun.  Jared felt himself tense.  The sooner he could be properly trained, the sooner he might get that medallion.  Then he wouldn't have to be Sammy anymore.  It felt  shame to have to hurt this nice man who was now his owner, but if he could beome a boy again....</p>
