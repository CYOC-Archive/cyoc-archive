<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miranda was sitting in a chair in the hospital waiting room shaking her leg up and down worriedly. Amara noticed this and put a hand to her back and gently rubbed her girlfriend&#39;s back as Miranda looked over at her girlfriend and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Miles is going to be okay, he&#39;s just getting some stitches is all.&quot; Amara said reassuring her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m worried about.&quot; Miranda replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Well, then what....&quot; Before Amara could finish, Miranda&#39;s parents, Miguel and Gabrielle came through the hospital doors in a hurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hija!&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed to Miranda as she ran over to her and gave her a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do you have a fever?&quot; Gabrielle asked worriedly holding her hand over her daughter&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá, I&#39;m fine, really. It&#39;s actually Miles who&#39;s hurt. So this is why I didn&#39;t want Mrs. Moreland to tell you on the phone what happened. Miles and some of our other friends got into a fight and now Miles is getting about twenty stitches across his chest.&quot; Miranda explained to her mother as she gave her a meek smile while her shoulders drooped.<br />
<br />
Gabrielle seemed to suddenly have a thousand yard stare as Miguel waved his hand in front of his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;¿Querida?&quot; Miguel asked his wife as Gabrielle&#39;s face now became bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;¡¡¡¡¿Qué?!!!!&quot; Gabrielle shouted as she now rambled off into a rant in Spanish. Miranda dreaded this moment and tried to argue back with her mother but Gabrielle cut her off multiple times until they all saw Miles emerge from surgery.<br />
<br />
&quot;¡Mi dulce bebé!&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed as she ran over and gave Miles a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá, careful, I just got my stitches done.&quot; Miles said as Gabrielle looked at her son, then at her daughter and took a deep breath then pulled her son next to Miranda and she sat the two of them down next to each other in chairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá....&quot; Miles and Miranda both groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silencio! Your father and I want the truth from both of you, now.&quot; Gabrielle said crossing her arms. The two opened their mouths but were stopped by Gabrielle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want the real truth, from both of you. You do not want me to go full Mexican mother on either of you.&quot; Gabrielle said narrowing her eyes at her children as they both gulped.<br />
<br />
Miles started to go first, he told them about the Moreland family and what they did and how they had been dealing with supernatural foes. During his latest outing, one of them had slashed Miles across the chest. Miranda then gave her own story as she slumped in her chair and told her parents that she was a magical girl sometimes like a Japanese like superhero.<br />
<br />
Miguel and Gabrielle looked at each other, then back at their kids raising their eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá, Papá, please, we&#39;re not lying about this. We really are telling the truth.&quot; Miranda insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Desoto? I&#39;m Nina Moreland, this is my brother in-law, Rick. We can explain all this to you a little better.&quot; Nina Moreland said as she came over to the two of them and Rick and Nina took the Desoto parents aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, see? This is all going to go well. Mrs. Moreland will explain everything to them and things will turn out well.&quot; Amara said trying to reassure Miranda and Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amara, you really don&#39;t know our parents after all this time, do you? We have essentially been keeping secrets from them for months and now our friends mom and his uncle are explaining this whole supernatural business to our parents.&quot; Miranda said eyeing the four of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just lucky, they didn&#39;t have to explain this to Abuela, she would be furious with us for basically lying like this to her.&quot; Miles said as Miranda rolled her head thinking about that conversation.<br />
<br />
About ten minutes later, Rick and Nina came back over with Miguel and Gabrielle who looked to be taken everything in still but took a deep breath before speaking with the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miles, Miguel, we&#39;re very disappointed that you&#39;ve kept this a secret from us for so long, but we both understand why you had to do it.&quot; Miguel said to his children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, unless there&#39;s anything else related to all of this you have to tell us, then everything should be fine.&quot; Gabrielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....&quot; Miranda thought to herself. &quot;Jenna actually has similar powers to me too, actually, I think she actually got her powers before me and....oh, mierda.&quot; Miranda said as Gabrielle seemed to be breathing very heavily and looked very angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I are going to make a call. Ahora.&quot; Gabrielle said as Miranda stood up. Miranda knew that her cousin, Jenna, was about to get a mouthful from her own mother.<br />
<br />
While they went to make a phone call, Miguel, sat down next to his son who looked him ashamed at what his father would have to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mi hijo, unlike your mother, I&#39;m not that mad at you. I&#39;m just...a little disappointed that neither of you came to us sooner about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Papá, but really, we never really knew how to tell you about all this stuff. I mean, both of our girlfriends are...well, let&#39;s just say they&#39;re part of the supernatural community in their own way. We&#39;ve really just been helping each other out and looking out for each other. Amara has really helped Miranda be more open now. Did you notice she&#39;s not even wearing her hair in front of her eyes a whole lot these last few months?&quot; Miles explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did notice that. But like I said, your mother and I, we trust you that you&#39;ll both be safe doing all of this stuff with your friends. You can still also come to us and ask us about anything else. How are....how are you and that Chenoa girl doing?&quot; Miguel asked putting a reassuring hand on his son&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s amazing papá, really. She&#39;s just been a little distant because she lost her parents earlier this year and now she&#39;s living with her godparents. I talk to her, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s helping any.&quot; Miles said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, you talking to her is helping her enough.&quot; Miguel said as he gave his son a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you....OW! OW! OW! MAMÁ!&quot; Miles said to his mother as she grabbed him by his ear while holding Miranda with her other hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miles, because of your injuries, and because you kept the truth from your father and I, you are going to be grounded for....a month at least. While you, Miranda are going to be grounded for two weeks. I just got a mouthful from your aunt about Jenna and she&#39;s equally disappointed in her. We&#39;re going home, now.&quot; Gabrielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mamá, can&#39;t we stay and....Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay!&quot; Miranda tried to argue but Gabrielle tugged at Miles and Miranda&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, say goodbye to your friends before we go.&quot; Gabrielle said letting go of their ears.<br />
<br />
Miranda gave Amara a kiss goodbye and Miles and Miranda said goodbye to the rest of their friends there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabrielle, look, if you&#39;d like to talk more, you can come over to my sister in-law&#39;s house. Mine&#39;s still being rebuilt due to....circumstances before all this.&quot; Nina offered as Gabrielle gave Nina a reassuring smile and nodded as they exchanged phone numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....mamá, maybe we can come to an arrangement instead on getting out of being grounded sooner?&quot; Miles asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make me get your abuela on the phone.&quot; Gabrielle warned her son as they headed out the doors of the hospital.</p>
