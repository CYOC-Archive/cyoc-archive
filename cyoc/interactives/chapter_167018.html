<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Excited to be writing my first story on this site after reading from the shadows for years.<br/>
Hope yall enjoy what I have in store for these guys.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;100 Gold Pieces!&quot; You see a thin elk yell out the first bid for your servitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;120!&quot; An eager fox calls from another end of the crowd immediately followed up by a tiger raising his paws up placing a hire bid. You stood there and watched as your price shot up and up: 150, 175, 190, 200, 240. Your heart thumping partially from embarrassment at being completely exposed but mostly from nervous anticipation as to who was going to be your new owner, stripped away of your freedoms. Your life as you knew it over just like the man before you who you manage to spot further back in the crowd. His new snow leopard owner was showing him off to a panther and otter, teasing the man by lifting up his thin loincloth and making lewd gestures at him. That was going to be him soon enough, just another possession to show off.<br />
<br />
The snow leopard turned and looked directly at you, his fangs poking out of a mischievous grin as he noticed you looking towards his new property. His long tail swished from side to side and ears perked up in interest. He wasn’t particularly buff but was at the very least well sculpted behind the thick layer of light-gray almost white fur. His piercing eyes studying you over which sends chills run down your spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;400 Gold Pieces!&quot; The snow leopard enters the bidding ring, the jangling of his other slave’s chain ringing out as he puts his paw in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back off Malik! You already got your slave!&quot; A rather angry wolf barked at the snow leopard&#39;s intrusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you don&#39;t need any more for your kinky play! Save some for the rest of us!&quot; A bearded dragon protested as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you&#39;re gonna have to outbid me like everyone else boys,&quot; The snow leopard, whose name you presume is Malik, smirked before the bidding resumed again. Any bid that was made was immediately countered by the feline giving no chance for the other bidders to counter his seemingly massive wealth. 400 became 500, then 600, 700 with the snow leopard seemingly unfazed by the soaring prices as he gazed solely upon you, his eyes seemingly scanning every inch of your body and his tail still as if he&#39;s a predator hunting his prey. It was obvious who was going to be your new owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going once...twice...SOLD, 880 Gold Pieces to the snow leopard!&quot; The fox auctioneer slammed his gavel down making you jump a bit. A few growls and frustrated yelling erupted from the crowd but the feline remained unfazed with a cheeky grin as he walked towards the stage, his other slave in hand looking towards you in fear and embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky you, getting two slaves all to yourself,&quot; The lion who was holding onto your leash up until this point hands the chain over to your new owner as he finishes counting his Gold Pieces for the fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say. He had a look in his eye that I couldn’t ignore,&quot; The snow leopard said coyly, running his rough padded paw down your chest before giving your crotch a pass over sending a jolt of pleasure that makes you gasp nervously. He chuckled at your reaction, &quot;When a cat gets curious we just have to follow our instincts. Now come along you two, we’ve gotta break you in right.”<br />
<br />
With that Malik turned around and tugged on both of your leashes causing you to stumble forward a bit before catching yourselves and following  your new master out of the public square. He seemed to walk with a bit of a skip, his long fluffy tail swaying happily from his recent purchases. As for you and the other slave you both looked to each other in shocked silence as you wandered the medieval looking cobble streets and marketplaces.<br />
<br />
Eventually you arrived at a large home towards the center of the city with a sign outside reading Malik’s Alkahestral Remedies. Walking inside it was a rather large house with plenty of fine artifacts decorating the halls indicating your owner was someone with a decent amount of wealth. You notice a room off to the side filled with different plants and bottles of different powders and liquids set up almost like a storefront with work tables in the back.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to your new home my little pets,” The snow leopard exclaimed as he hung his thin jacket on the coat rack and tugged on your leashes, “I’m going to be your new master, Malik. You are to refer to me as Master or Master Malik exclusively, understood.”<br />
<br />
“Y-You can’t do this to us,” The other slave protested, “We’ve got lives outside of this place.”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s your mistake for leaving there now isn’t it my precious boy,” Malik yanked on his leash pulling the man closer towards him where he proceeded to run his paws across the man’s body. He gasped as the cat ran his paw up his member, his tail also curling around him making sure the slave knew he was the snow leopard’s possession.<br />
<br />
“Please...just let us go,” You beg the snow leopard, “We promise we won’t ever trespass here again.”<br />
<br />
“Oh but where’s the fun in that,” It was your turn to be inspected as he grabbed onto your sides and pulled you closer, his paws making sure to explore every inch of your body, “I paid good money for the both of you and I’m gonna make sure I get my money’s worth. You especially cost me a pretty penny so you’d better be ready to perform,” He groped your ass as he said this causing you to jump nervously.<br />
<br />
“You’re gonna be a fun one to break,” Malik toyed as he stepped away, his tail taking its time snaking around your form before he turned to face the two of you yet again, “You two will be serving me for life as my sexy little toys who will do whatever I desire. In your off time feel free to pleasure yourselves as you see fit though remember Master’s pleasure comes first. Finally you’re getting new and more fitting names: Kit and Cat,” He pointed to the other man and then yourself.<br />
<br />
Outraged you speak up, “You can’t do this! I have a name already!”<br />
<br />
“All irrelevant the moment I bought you. If you continue to misbehave I have ways of disciplining my pets,” Malik brings his claws close up to your neck and stares you right in the eyes, tugging on your leash to make sure you can’t run, “Do I make myself clear Cat.”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes,” You reply back nervously staring into his fierce eyes.<br />
<br />
“Yes who?” The feline presses a claw tip against your neck, he smiles seeing the fear in your eyes.<br />
<br />
“Yes...Master.”<br />
<br />
“Very good,” He releases his grip on your collar and retracts his claws before turning towards the stairs, “Now that that’s out of the way let’s get you two broken in shall we.”<br />
<br />
He goes up the stairs with you and Kit in tow both of you scared for your new lives in sexual servitude.</p>
