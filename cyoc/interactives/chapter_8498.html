<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin was shaking some from fear but mostly from expectation. A lifelong dream of being changed from man to animal seemed to be in his grasp.<br />
<br />
The Madame' stood looking at her prize and seeing a 6'7&quot; tall man weighing in at more than 245 pounds was having second thoughts about him joining her goat herd. &quot;Your rather large to be shrunk down into a goat's form, maybe another form might be more appropriate?&quot; suggested Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;A billy goat would be fine!&quot; replied Kevin, his eyes wide with wild hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my young man size matters quite a bit less I the spell caster wishes to drain my powers to force the change. You are broad of shoulders, heavy of chest, no doubt an athlete in years past?&quot; asked the Madame DeOgge.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kevin felt as if this conversation was some sort of big joke being played on a dumb American. He got up and stood facing the elderly woman. &quot;I'm a fool alright, thinking that out of all the world I should fall in with a person of enough knowledge and power to make my form different!&quot; said Kevin as he turned to walk back to the Land Rover and leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; hollered the Madame'.<br />
<br />
Yet Kevin paid her no mind and continued to put his cameras into the back seat of the vehicle and was ready to get inside. A quick and longing look back to the old woman he had now only angered feelings about his hope dashed.<br />
<br />
The old woman waved her hand as the herd of goats charged from their standing nearby. Stunned Kevin watched till one big gray goat butted his knee and knocked Kevin to the ground.<br />
<br />
A new realm of fear no doubt came over Kevin as he laid on the black volcanic ground and looked into the blue eyes of a man made to goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue eyes, blue eyes, goat's have yellow eyes not blue!&quot; said Kevin in a shaky voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;True young man, unless they were men before being goat! He was not quite as big like you but I had to make him something or he might have raped my Niece. A quick sprinkle of cursing powder and the gray hairs sprouted like spring grass. Soon he was on his way to be this very hardy male buck. The girl saw her error of such ways as the powder touched her as well. He became this big buck and for the past eight years has performed well as the prime stud. I let the Niece change almost to a nanny goat and when her fear of such life was at it's peak I ripped her from it and back to humanity. Oh to be sure that she kept her promise on virgin birth I left her privates covered in coarse goaty wool till she was wed.&quot; said the laughing woman to a hopeful man.<br />
<br />
Kevin looked into the Madame's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now young man and stand on the mat of change!&quot; offered the Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;The, the mat of change?&quot; asked Kevin still filled with wild hopes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may undress now to whatever state of nakedness you would be comfortable being, then walk to the yonder tree.&quot; said the Madame as she walked back to her dark and shack like house.<br />
<br />
Kevin stripped down and was standing on the woven mat below the spreading limbs of the old and great tree.<br />
<br />
Madame DeOgge walked out her house with a clay jar and one long peacock feather. Stepping up to the totally naked man she began her chant and tossed white powder over Kevin.<br />
<br />
The Baaing of goats almost drowned out the strange words of Madame as she called to the spirit world. At last Kevin stood well dusted with powder and all was suddenly silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion, Medallion!&quot; called the Madame' to her silver prize.<br />
<br />
&quot;A prize be this man to stand ready, may he feel your power in the change to come! He is strong as a man, bold of chest, hardy in strength, may he be gifted this too in his life and form! Medallion, Medallion warm thy power and grant this man his wish to live here in Brazil as one of our fine male Oxen!&quot; charged Madame'.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, a goat, a horse, a, a, a....but not a Ox!&quot; cried Kevin but all too late as he watched his hands meld into dark tan lumps. A dun colored hair sprang like Spring grass as his skin changed to animal hide.<br />
<br />
Ears jolted out into large bovine shape and began to flick about as the nervous man became one solid male Ox. Closing his eyes in a wrenching pain he felt both agony and the straining of his skull in growth. A moan, then another but as each moan came it was in itself sounding more of bovine lowing than human cries of pain.<br />
<br />
Kevin's manly chest was under attack as the growing of animal muscle and beastly size bones gave new understanding to Kevin. In his pain of change he realized that this was not meant to be, he as some before him had gone through Hell to lose what nature had granted them from birth.<br />
<br />
As tail and huge hind quarters grew to Ox size the human mind was now under attack by the Spirits. Little did Kevin realize that as an animal instincts govern and not human reasoning. He would need to rely on bestial thought patterns and instinctive movement if he were to live and survive as an Ox.<br />
<br />
At last standing on all fours, his weight shifted about and Kevin looked his new huge body over as best an Ox could. A slow walking turn round and around his balls swung, his sheath jiggled, ears flopped and a boney long tail swung as it brushed the bubbled lips of his now bovine ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Spirits are true, they know just what is right and perfect! Young one you are the finest Ox I have ever seen! You will stay here and learn the simple animal things such as grazing. Then when market time comes in the village down below we take you there to be sold and then live the life of true beast, won't you just love it?&quot; beckoned the Madame.<br />
<br />
Kevin stood feeling the air flow about his huge form and felt flies gather to seek out his big ass end. A sudden need to urinate brought on a fair size puddle as then the flies jumped for his shaky sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore the flies or find joy in their tickling of your privates, I say you have little to fear!&quot; chided the Madame as she motioned for the goats to come near.</p>
