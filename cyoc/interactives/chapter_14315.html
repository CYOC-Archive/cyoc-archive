<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This really grossed him out.  <br />
<br />
The thought of clipping his fathers back hair was a little more than he could handle for the moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much do you weight, dad?&quot; Andrew asked casually as his father got the razor out of the cabinet. With his back turned to him, Andrew had a full view of the forest of hair that covered his father's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I dunno son, but I’ve definitely gained some since last night, and... So have you, ya know&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ... well, how much did you weight?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Me? oh probably around 220, but now I, I just don’t know.&quot; Butch looked down at his burly body. Admiring his new size and muscularity, But the sheer amount of body hair was still overwhelming to his eyes. It had spread up over his shoulders, all around his neck and down his back, spreading out from the thickest sections along the middle of his back. The hair now circled Butch’s entire body, connecting on his side to his stomach hair and, in total, his body hair was completely connected: all the way from his head down all the way to his fat, hair-covered toes. <br />
<br />
Butch bent over, stretching the tight jeans he had on, searching for a little razor in the drawers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha!&quot; Butch exclaimed upon finding a sack of disposable razors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, now, while i clip my beard, you put this on my back&quot; Butch said, handing Andrew some shaving cream and the disposable razor. <br />
<br />
Andrew began putting the shaving cream on his dad's back. He could feel the thick hair rub against his fingers as he spread it around. Shaving his fathers back hair was not going to be a fun experience. It was just too disgusting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, can I not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, you do this favor for me and I'll make sure you'll have plenty of money to go find some good new clothes, and gas for the rest of the month... now how about you start shaving? My backs getting cold&quot; His father replied sharply.  Butch needed this one favor, even he couldn’t stand the prospect of having such a hairy back when his wife got back into town. What would she say? Butch was a hairy man to begin with, but this was just too much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, well...&quot; and with that Andrew began to shave the thick hair on his dads back. Meanwhile his dad was busy clipping his bushy beard back into shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; He cried and flinched. &quot;Be careful son! A little slower, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
And they continued on, Butch soon finished, but Andrew worked on, there was a lot to shave. Butch looked back into the mirror. His beard was nice and well groomed again, no longer wild, and all that remained was the trim back the thick hair on his neck. Butch grabbed the electric razor and turned it on.<br />
<br />
Andrew was getting down to his dad's Lower back and was to disgust by the whole thing he could barely contain himself. He shut his eyes a little as he moved the razor down to the top of Butch's jeans. 'Oh good' he thought.  No more... <br />
<br />
As he removed the razor and cleaned off the area with a towel his dad barked at him: &quot;Not done yet, are you? What about my neck?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah! ok ok&quot; Andrew replied hastily. Butch leaned and stooped a bit to make it easier for his son. Soon the razor had cleaned up the unsightly hair that had taken over the base of his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok son! Now for your beard!&quot; Butch cried enthusiastically &quot;Oh, its sounds great to say those words!&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew made a face, &quot;Well, when you have a son, you'll understand what I mean!&quot; Butch replied. &quot;Now stand still&quot; And with that Butch began to clip back Andrews thick beard. &quot;This is going to take a while, and I suggest you watch yourself in the mirror, be careful, don’t cut yourself.&quot; He said, handing off the clippers to his son.<br />
<br />
Butch stood there and watched his son clip it down and down, slowly, until a very short uneven beard had emerged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good good&quot; Butch said. &quot;Now here is the razor... sooner or later you were going to have to learn how to shave...&quot; Butch proceeded to carefully show his son the procedure of shaving.<br />
<br />
Within moments the youthful face of Andrew had re-emerged out from under a thick beard, and his father stood pleased. &quot;Good to go, my son!&quot; Andrew's face had returned to its previous appearance... almost. He could tell something made him look a little different, maybe, older? he couldn’t put his finger on it. Andrew stepped out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Andrew checked the time on the clock in the hallway: 8:14<br />
<br />
He hadn’t eaten breakfast and was feeling unusually hungry. His school had already started. &quot;So what do you want to do now?&quot; His father asked as they stepped into the living room. Andrew couldn’t help feel his freshly-shaven cheeks and neck. It felt so odd to him; He could still feel the hairs, now nice and trim, even though they were no longer clearly visible. How odd it felt, his first shave. <br />
<br />
&quot;So? Hungry?&quot; Butch asked as he walked into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no, no, I think I’ll wait...&quot; Andrew replied. He didn’t want to eat his fathers cooking when he could go out for breakfast...<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that clothes shopping?&quot; he asked. &quot;These aren’t going to do too well for long&quot; he said, pointing at his sweat pants. &quot;And nothing else fits me anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, ok, well if you want to do that now, that ok by me&quot; his father said calmly &quot;And thanks for the shave... here ya go..&quot; Butch plowed his fingers through his wallet, good thing he had passed by the Bank yesterday. <br />
<br />
This was perfect, Andrew thought, he could go to the mall without the risk of seeing anyone he knew... they were all in school! Plus he could finally get some fitting clothes, as he couldn’t go around wearing his only pair of sweat pants for too long...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey 'drew, how big are you now anyway? Did you weigh yourself?&quot; His father asked, &quot;Uh, about 200 pounds&quot;. Andrew replied. Butch nodded his head and handed his son well over 200 dollars for some new clothes Andrew thanks his dad for the money grabbed his keys on the dining room table and made his way out the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like 200&quot; Butch quietly muttered under his breath. He couldn’t believe his son's new size, he had completely transformed from a skinny young man into a big kid, bulky and very muscular for a 17 year old.<br />
<br />
Andrew got into his car. The car bounced a little as Andrew jumped into his little Honda. There appeared to him that there was much less room in his seat as he turned on the ignition. It wasn’t terribly cramp, but it was noticeably less room to move around. Andrew, still starving, planned to swing by a place for breakfast before going to the mall.... Andrew drove out of the driveway and sped down his street, turned his signal on, and made his way onto the main road...</p>
