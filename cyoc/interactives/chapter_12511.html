<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky trying to clear some space in her closet, tried on her blouses, shirts, tanks, pants, skirts, and dresses trying to decide on what to keep and what no longer fit, or was out of style.<br />
<br />
Now with a bag full of clothes Vicky stood back and looked at the closet which was now less then 2/3 full of her clothes. Plenty of room she thought as she closed the closet doors and then went over to the dresser to clean out a few drawers. <br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later as the door bell rang Vicky had three drawers of the eight empty and the bag was now filled with sweatpants, sweaters, sweatshirts, jeans along with some of the clothes from the closet. Meanwhile the garbage next to the dresser had some old lingerie that Vicky no longer wore or was embarrassed to let Brian see.<br />
<br />
Vicky ran down the steps to the front door and opened it. Dan was standing on the doorstep. &quot;Thank god your here I don't have much time&quot; Vicky stated.<br />
<br />
Dan stepped into the house &quot;What time is Brian coming home&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In an hour at the latest, so we have to rush a little. But you don't mind do you?&quot; Vicky asked as her nose scrunched up in her cute little way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I would help Vicky if I have to sweat a little, oh well that what friends are for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dan, your so sweet&quot; Vicky replied as she turned around leaving  Dan with the view of backside. &quot;Follow me&quot; he heard Vicky say as he closed the door and followed her up the stairs noticing her tight round butt in blank pants and remembering all the times he had that ass in his hands. Dan also noticed the back of the white short sleeve blouse as his thoughts changed form the butt to the blouse especially what was sticking out of the blouse, the C cup breasts which looked even bigger on her short little body. Dan couldn't help but think about all the times he had his hands and mouth on those globes. Dan's mind went off of the breasts and on to the hair as his eyes drifted off of the blouse and on to the shiny, healthy, blond hair that was cut to shoulder length. The hair that which each step she took moved from side to side on her white blouse. The hair that he used to love to run his hands through. Yeah Dan thought to himself as Vicky made it to the top of the steps and headed down the hallway , she is a perfect woman and I let her slip away. <br />
<br />
When they both were in  Vicky's bedroom Vicky began discussing her plans &quot;I want the dresser over here, the night stand on the other side of the bed, that picture down and that bag of clothes to be given away to charity and as for the other rooms I want.&quot; However Vicky noticed the concerned look Dan was giving her. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure your ready for this, maybe you two should talk it over first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I want to surprise him. I want to show him I want him in my life all the time just like the way he showed me when he asked me to marry him. Now I know your still concerned about our ages, and how we're too young to get married but we feel were both ready for it, and we both want it more then anything in the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just worried that your rushing things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been dating five months and engaged twenty days, I know thats a bit rushed but I want to spend every minute I can with Brian! Don't you feel the same way about Carol?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been only dating two months&quot; Dan stated as his mind drifted to the night he met Carol, the worst night of his life. It was the night when Brian informed him that he was planning on asking Vicky to marry him and what did he think? He wanted to say that he shouldn't ask her, that Vicky hated his guts however his reply was that she would love it, and he knew she would. So after telling Brian that he only had one option, get drunk and score, and that he did with Carol. Sure Carol had a decent butt, good size breasts but she didn't have blond hair, and she definitely was no Vicky. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe in time you'll feel the same way about her or another woman&quot; Vicky stated. <br />
<br />
I already do Dan wanted to say but instead the words &quot;I hope so&quot; came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;So can we get started I really want to get done before Brian get's home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Dan said reluctantly &quot;I can see how much this means to you so lets get it done before Brain gets home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky's face brightened and a smile formed as they began doing the tasks she stated that needed to be done in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Dan couldn't help but think how did he let Vicky slip away. His mind went back to the night they broke up. The night where Vicky said she loved him, that she loved him like a brother, not a boyfriend. She loved the conversation and spending time with him shopping or exercising, however she just didn't feel that spark. So what did he think about just being friends she asked him with hope in her face? <br />
<br />
Dan couldn't even think for a second about hurting that face or her, so his answer was yes. However he wished he answered no. He wished that he told her that he wanted her to be his girlfriend, his wife, since he loved her more than anything in this world and would do anything for her. Instead he let another man tell her that. He let another man take his place and he would be in that place for life. Thus it will no longer be visiting Vicky, it will be visiting Brian and Vicky.<br />
<br />
Dan worked furiously, building up a sweat in the process as they rushed through the different tasks Vicky had in mind. <br />
<br />
They both were on the way to Dan's car with Vicky carrying Dan's keys and Dan carrying the bag of clothes Vicky was donating to charity. It was now 5:15 p.m. exactly fifty minutes since Dan stepped out of his car and about twelve minutes before Brain was due to arrive and all the tasks were completed. Vicky put the keys into the lock and noticed the ring on her finger the one that Dan bought her, she forgot all about it. Dan tossed the bag of clothes in the trunk and Vicky closed the trunk when the bag landed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was so rushed with getting everything done that I forgot to show you what I found today&quot; Vicky said as she held up her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your engagement ring I already saw you engagement ring&quot; Dan replied as his anger grew at the sight of the big rock on her hand, one he never could afford.<br />
<br />
&quot;No silly just above it&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan noticed the ring, the ring that she begged him to buy for her at the fair. The ring that he bought for her only to have her break up with him a week later. &quot;Oh yeah the ring I bought for you at the fair. I haven't noticed you wearing it in awhile did you lose it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was in the pocket of one of my pants that I haven't worn in awhile.&quot; Vicky replied quickly with the first thing that popped into her head trying to hide the fact that she felt bad for making Dan spend his money on a ring, especially one that after a day she wondered who in their right mind would want it. Which is why she stuffed it into that purse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to give that to charity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What! No way, this ring is a bond of our friendship. I would never give it up.&quot; Vicky stated as she felt bad about the ring and having to lie once again to Dan's face because she knew it would go right back into a place where she didn't have to look at it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose I better get going before Brian comes home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't let my best friend get away without giving a proper thank you. Vicky moved closer to Dan and extended her arms up and out. &quot;I'm the luckiest girl in the world, I have the best fiance and the best friend anyone could have&quot; Dan heard Vicky say as he bent down and their arms wrapped around each other as Vicky's breasts pressed into him. However instead of a feeling of joy, they both felt a jolt of pain and the reflexes caused their eyes to close. <br />
<br />
Dan felt different after the jolt quickly feeling his chest being squashed and his arms reaching up instead of downward and something brushing against his ears as his eyes opened. Meanwhile Vicky noticed that instead of feeling her breasts being squashed, she felt like she was squashing something, she could also feel her arms which were now extending down and the slight pain in her back from bending. Not to mention her perfume filled her nose usually she couldn't even smell it, now it was intoxicating she thought to herself as she opened her eyes. <br />
<br />
Dan noticed he was now looking at the sky while Vicky noticed she was now looking at the cement and the back of a white blouse and black pants. The both broke the hug instantly and stepped back.<br />
<br />
The shocked expression on their faces never changed as Dan was the first to say anything &quot; How, How did this happen?&quot; he said as he noticed Vicky's voice coming out as he talked.<br />
<br />
Dan looked at his old body for an answer and all he saw was a shocked expression and all he got was a &quot;I don't know&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are we going to do?&quot; Dan pleaded from Vicky's body.<br />
<br />
All Vicky did from his body was reply &quot;I don't know&quot; as her expression of shock remained frozen on her face.</p>
