<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Julie woke up the next morning, she felt refreshed.  Like she'd gotten a full nights sleep instead of having sex all through the night.  She didn't even feel hungry, then again she'd probably eaten enough cum to fill a jar of jam.  Getting up out of bed she grabbed her bra off the ground and her thong off the nightstand.  Sliding them back on she turned them back to her tank top and skirt and buckled her sword on her waist.  She started to finger herself, thinking of all the things they'd done last night, and wondered if Cel'thas had left any of the women around.  Seeing Kenan wasn't going anywhere, Julie decided to turn back to a human.  Her horns, tail, and wings retracted back into her body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly it all hit her, she had just had wild sex with a guy.  A guy she used to call her friend.  She had sucked his dick.  The taste of his cum was still in her mouth.  The thought made her nauseous and she threw up.  Her retching woke Kenan up, who squinted against the light, and he laughed at her predicament.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter?  Got an upset stomach from to much sweets?&quot; Kenan asked impishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a bastard Kenan.  I promise you that the moment I figure it out, I am so going to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what are your thoughts of last night then?&quot; Kenan asked curiously.  He removed his blanket and Julie saw his boner.  Julie looked at it hungrily.  &quot;You forced me, Kenan.  I had no choice, I needed your cock, Kenan.  I needed it in me.  Even now I fantasize about you shoving it into me and I'd welcome every minute of it.  You made me like it and now I'd do it again and again till you dropped from exhaustion.  Just because I need that though, doesn't mean I like you.  It's just another thing I need to figure out.&quot;  Julie's pussy was wet and dripping and her demonic features pushed out again.  &quot;You don't think we have time for another round do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie realized what she had said and stepped back, regretting it but she knew that if Kenan said yes that she wouldn't be able to resist her compulsion.  She pulled back her demonic features and she felt an uncomfortable feeling over her body, as if she was wearing a full body suit and it was all a little to tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Julie, we had enough fun for now.  It's time we got back to collecting those artifacts to increase my power. I know it seems impressive right now but it has its limits.  Your first mission is to visit the kingdom of Merlon and demand their unconditional surrender.  In the royal treasury is the Invisibility Cloak and the Shade Stone.  Tell them that if they give you these artifacts as a sign of their agreement then I will not destroy them but they will become a part of my empire.  If they do not accept the terms then I want you to steal the artifacts, enlist the local brigands, and assassinate the royalty.  When you return I will send in my army and we shall go after our next target.  Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded, &quot;I understand the plan but this has to do with last night.  You said 'this demonic form', what did you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simply that you have a variety of forms.  After all, your going to have to do more then have sex with the enemy.&quot; Julie groaned at that, &quot;You'll also need to run away from them and occasionally kill them in large numbers.  You should naturally change to the suitable form whenever the situation arises.  Each of your forms has a little surprise for you in them.  I hope you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you going to do while I'm taking care of all that?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does any dark wizard do after capturing a town?  I'll transform the children into proper minions and then back to the tower for the women.  Would you like to see what I have planned?&quot;<br />
Kenan finally got up and found his robes and put them on, bringing out a sigh of disappointment from Julie.  &quot;Sure.&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
Kenan went to the door and told his guards to send up one of the children and one of the women to his room.  The lizard men bowed deeply before going off on their errand.  Julie didn't have long to wait before the two slaves were brought to the room.  Julie had to admit that the woman was pretty in her blue dress, now torn and dirtied but her eyes had some spirit in them.  The child was a little boy of about 7 or 8 with dirty blond hair and the same eyes as the woman.  Julie guessed that the two were mother and son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll not beg.&quot; the woman said, cutting off Kenan before he could speak.  The act infuriated Kenan and he motioned to the guard.  The creature grabbed the woman's arm and snapped the forearm so she looked like she had another elbow.  The woman cried out from the pain and the kid cried, &quot;Mommy, Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
While all this was going on Kenan waved his wand at the two, mumbling to himself.  When he stopped he seemed satisfied and said,&quot;Shut Up.&quot; and the room was deathly quiet.  &quot;Just for that I think I'll do the boy first.  Look closely now, your not going to like what you're going to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenan waved his wand at the boy and his skin started to turn green and his blond hair fell off his head.  His ears grew out till they were long and pointy and his teeth changed till they were all pointy.  His blue eyes turned golden and the whites turned black.  Then his arms grew slightly longer till his hands touched the floor with out bending over and his fingers grew longer and seemed to have another joint.  His nails became black claws.  Then the child's skinny frame started to bulge out and then harden into thick corded muscles.<br />
<br />
At the sight of her boy being turned into a monster, the woman wept, &quot;Oh Krispin, what has he done to you?&quot;  The boy turned monster cocked its head quizzically at his mother before a wicked leer appeared on its face and the creature's drool started dangling from its fangs.  It got close to the woman and the woman wrapped her arms around the creature's leg and wept.  Julie watched in horror as the boy started tearing at the woman's cloths, giggling maniacally.  Realizing what was about to happen, the woman let go and tried to pull away but she couldn't break free of the monster's vice like grip.<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, Kenan stopped the monster, &quot;Much I'd like to see this, I have a very busy day in front of me.  Have to turn all the children into these little goblinkin.  I'll make you a promise though, you can see this boy's first litter in three weeks.  Help name them even, though I don't know how much interest you'll have in him by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The goblinkin stepped away from its former mother as Kenan began waving his wand again and pointed at the woman.  At first the woman had blond hair with blue eyes and a pretty face, the tatters of her blue dress hanging from her.  Then those tatters fell away from her and her small breasts began to expand until they were larger then Julie's and the hair on her crotch and legs fell away.  The woman's skin from her neck down turned an azure blue and a became scaly.  Beautiful patterns in green and yellow then traced themselves along her skin.  The woman's eyes then turned yellow and the pupils were black slits.  Her hair then changed to a dark blue to match her skin.  &quot;Now for the best part, dance slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman's eyes narrowed dangerously and she strode toward Kenan with such animosity that Julie's protective urge almost had her tackling the nude slave. Without a hint of self-consciousness, the woman's breast jiggled as her hips swayed from side to side.  Julie could only explain it as slithering vertically, when the woman stopped in front of Kenan then began to move her belly back and forth very quickly.  At first Julie thought the woman was like any belly dancer until she saw the dancer twist her left arm 360 degrees while her right hand had been placed behind her back and rested easily on her left shoulder.  Julie was amazed by the flexibility of the slave and stared as the woman ended her dance by slithering across the floor and presenting her rear invitingly.  Julie almost jumped her right there she was so aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm going to have fun playing around with the colors and I think the real selling point is she is pratically boneless.  I'm sure the troops will just love them.  What was your name slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman prostrated herself before Kenan and her voice came out in a hiss,&quot;Sssara.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's not fitting at all.  Your new name will be Azure.  You will be the Head Concubine for my harem.  Your duties will be to go through all the women that I change and mate with them.  Those you like the best are to go to the harem while all others are to be sent to the barracks to service the troops.  If you find someone you think will please me more than you then you will give them the title of Head Concubine.  Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake woman didn't even raise her head, &quot;Yess Masster.  I am Asssure.  Only thosse I deem worthy will have the pleassure of sserving the  Masster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenan nodded, &quot;Have fun on your mission Julie and if you complete it to my satisfaction then I'll let you have Azure all to yourself for a whole day.  Merlon is about a two day's ride to the north from here.  Grab a horse and tell them of me.  If you need to talk to me then feel free to use the stone I gave you earlier.&quot;  Kenan then turned to Azure,&quot;Now let me show you what I like.&quot;  Taking that as a dismissal, Julie left the room and prepared for her journey.  She would have to be careful as it was unlikely for this kingdom to just accept what had happened here at Facile Victum.  Julie knew the village would only entertain Kenan for a week before he decided to go conquer somewhere else.  It would probably even be Merlon.<br />
<br />
Julie picked up her horse and saw the Slave boy Krispin that had been changed into a goblinkin kneeling next to a boulder as big as he was.  She was impressed when the creature easily hefted it up and set it next to a pile of other stones.  Then it placed its hands on the rock, its black claws scraping the stone, and the pile of stones turned black and the cracks started to fade away as the stones fused together.  Julie idly wondered if this was the beginning of the wall or the fortress the goblinkin was creating.  Curious she came up next to the stone and punched it with all her might.  Julie felt a brief flare as her hand broke and not a crack appeared in the stone.  Julie was impressed as she shook her hand and the bones realigned and reset themselves.  Julie nodded before shaking the reigns on her horse and started her journey Merlon.</p>
