<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Udoca told me where the mall was and I was surprised to find that it was located in the warehouse district. As I made my way there 
what seemed to be memories began to bubble up in my mind. An image of a white room with many people came to my mind. More 
images followed of me as a 37 year old guy being transformed into the daughter of a god and going to a magic school. The last images 
that came was me and another with a baby girl facing two gods then blackness before my dream. They had a dream like quality but with 
what I was told I was more inclined to believe that they were memories of who I was.</p>
<p>Coming out of the woods I see the mall. It was five stories tall and took up the whole warehouse district and extended into the lake. 
I wondered how this could be until I remembered that this was the Nexus and things didn't follow the normal rules. I made my way 
around the outside of the mall looking for Ansley figuring that he would be outside the mall if he looked like a homeless person. At the 
back I saw the docks but there was just a bit of land and no way for trucks to back up to them. Of course this was the Nexus so they 
probably just popped into place when they were needed. After looking around the outside of the mall and not finding anyone I decide to 
go into the mall. The first thing that I see is the food court and looking around I noticed that many of the people were in the process of 
transforming and by the looks on their faces I'd say many of them were unaware that they were transforming. I didn't see any sign of 
Ansley though so I continued my search.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," a woman said tapping on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said turning around to face her. She appeared to be in her late teens early twenties.</p>
<p>"I was wondering if you could help me," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Depends on what it is," I said with a shrug.</p>
<p>"Well I was wondering if you would pretend to be my girlfriend so my boyfriend will get the hint that it's over," she said with a slight 
blush.</p>
<p>"I don't think that will work," I said shaking my head. "I'm not old enough to be your girlfriend. Your boyfriend wouldn't believe it."
</p>
<p>"Well we can take care of that with a trip to one of the stores," the woman said holding out her hand.</p>
<p>"Ok lead the way," I said gesturing for her to do just that.</p>
<p>As she led me through the mall towards the stores I wondered at the wisdom of following this woman when I didn't know her name. 
I was about to ask her name when some guy shouted, "Begone, Jaundoco. She is not to become your pet or any part of your sick little 
game."</p>
<p>Jaundoco swiftly twirls around and spits, "She is mine by way of her decision Ansley. You cost me one already and you will not cost 
me this one."</p>
<p>Jaundoco grabbed me by the arm as Ansley said, "She made her decision long before she came here. Now let her go."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Jaundoco said narrowing her eyes and tightening her grip on my arm.</p>
<p>"What's going on here?" I asked trying to wrench my arm free.</p>
<p>"Jaundoco transforms people into animals to be sold as pets and livestock," Ansley said.</p>
<p>"That doesn't go against the rules of our people but interfering does," Jaundoco said pulling me close.</p>
<p>"I didn't agree to be transformed into an animal," I said looking daggers at Jaundoco.</p>
<p>"You just have to agree to a transformation," Jaundoco said with a wicked smile. "Since you did you're mine."</p>
<p>"She's already made her choice Jaundoco," Ansley said. "She has a different destiny."</p>
<p>"Destinies can be changed by the decisions people make," Jaundoco said her voice starting to drip with venom. "I let the last one go 
but this one is mine. She said she was willing to be transformed and that is going to happen."</p>
<p>"What were you going to transform me into?" I asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>"A female foal," Jaundoco said.</p>
<p>"You will not be transforming her," Ansley said. "The deal isn't sealed until she is and thus she has time to back out."</p>
<p>"Then I don't want to be transformed by you," I said to Jaundoco trying to pull my arm away again.</p>
<p>"Oh you will be transformed," Jaundoco hissed at me.</p>
<p>"Oh I will transform but I don't think you'll like it," I said as I reached up and pressed the ruby. My body tingled as the mall faded 
from view to be replaced by the warehouse district. As soon as the tingling stopped I turned into mist to get out of Jaundoco's grip.</p>
<p>"How?" Jaundoco asked looking wide eyed at the warehouses and my empty clothes.</p>
<p>I reformed into the demon from my dream behind her and hissed in her ear, "You don't mess with a demon."</p>
<p>Jaundoco screamed and ran away so fast I could hardly believe it. Giggling I concentrated on returning to my body. My skin became 
lighter until it was the normal color of my skin, my hair grew back out, my breasts shrank down to my breast buds, my horns, wings, and 
tail were reabsorbed into my body, my hands and feet became normal again, and my tongue and teeth became normal again. As I put 
my clothes back on I wondered if I should go back to the Nexus and find Ansley or just go home.</p></p>
