<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chirping noises finally pulled Dave out of his sleep and dreams of what happened on the couch last night. Not birds, electronic chirping, his phone emitting the soft chimes from where he left it on the dresser. He lay naked on top of the sheets. Stretching out, he felt fantastic. The last few years he would wake up feeling stiff or sore, but today he felt wonderful. Faint light streamed in from the window, more from it overlooking a tight alley than the day being dim. Something else shared his excitement, he could feel it sticking out from his groin, hard and proud.<br />
<br />
He let his hand trail down his stomach, fingers running along the fuzz on his gut before wrapping around his cock, already slick from pre. He shivered as he gave his member a few solid tugs. It felt larger in his hand than he remembered, but stroking himself off felt too good to worry about that small oddity for now.<br />
<br />
Dave didn&#39;t bother trying to push away the thoughts of Todd that lingered in his mind as he jerked himself off. Not that he was gay or anything, nothing like that. Maybe Todd was his one. Isn&#39;t that how it was, every straight guy had that one guy they would go gay for? It must be that. Todd was just special.<br />
<br />
He bucked his hips against his hand as he remembered last night&#39;s blow job. He arched his back, hips coming off the bed as he came, globs of warm cum splattering across his stomach and chest. He dropped back down to the sheets with a sigh, basking in the aftermath of his orgasm. Even jerking off felt better than it had in years. He got to his feet and padded over to the dresser, he grabbed a sock from the dirty pile of laundry to clean himself off a little, then picked up his phone.<br />
<br />
There were two messages from Cherise, one telling him to come pick up the rest of his stuff today, another threatening to throw it out on the curb if he didn&#39;t. He sighed and sent back a text he&#39;d ne there in few hours. He didn&#39;t have much, he had sold pretty much all his furniture when he moved in with her, and he never had much to begin with. No doubt she had a few boxes packed and waiting for him, claiming anything they bought together was hers. Annoyed, he dug for his towel, tossed it over his shoulder and strode out of the room, he needed a shower.<br />
<br />
Stepping out into the apartment he was greeted with a whistle. &quot;Looking good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave started and looked over to the small table near the kitchen where Todd sat shirtless eating a bowl of cereal. He was looking at Dave over his phone, which he had been tapping away on again.<br />
<br />
Dave blushed a little and pulled the towel off his shoulder, wrapping it around his waist. &quot;Sorry, old habits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I didn&#39;t see last night.&quot; Todd said with a grin as he stood up and picked up his bowl. With a shock, Dave noticed Todd was naked as well. Cock bobbing between his thighs as he walked to the sink. Though Dave found his eyes lingering on that perfectly rounded rear. He wanted to walk right over there, push Todd up against the counter, and slide his cock right between those cheeks. He felt his cock hardening again, pushing against the towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not.&quot; Still, Dave tore his eyes away from the sight and rushed into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He went over to the sink and braced himself on it with his hands. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself. He needed to find another place to stay. He couldn&#39;t keep having those thoughts. He opened his eyes and looked at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him wasn&#39;t the tired, worn out husk he had grown used to seeing in the mirror. It was his face, sure, if another face had been staring back at him he would have freaked, but a small part of him expected it. No, he just looked, fresher was the only word he could think of. The creases of forming wrinkles had smoothed out a bit leaving only  few fine lines at the corners of his eyes. His hair and stubble had lost almost all of the gray that had been peppered in, back to being mostly black. Even his hairline seemed to have moved forward a bit. He still looked rough, his hair messed and the stubble untamed, but he didn&#39;t look worn out like he had. He would have chalked it up to a good night&#39;s rest, but sleep didn&#39;t fix gray hairs.<br />
<br />
He touched the hair one his head almost tentatively. It even felt thicker, then ran a hand on his jaw. He then rifled through the drawers, finding an unused razor and some shaving cream. Readying the razor he looked at himself in the mirror, then changed his mind. He was going to shave clean, but instead he started taming the stubble. Evening it out on his cheeks, cleaning up his neck. He wiped the rest of the shaving cream clean and admired his work. The stubbly beard looked good on him, and he nodded in satisfaction. He was his own man again and bucking Cherise&#39;s insistence he be clean shaven seemed a good way to start.<br />
<br />
He even brushed his fingers along the too long stubble he had let grow in on his chest. It seemed to cover more than he remembered, but he had been shaving it for years, probably just his imagination. Still, that wasn&#39;t the biggest oddity. His chest actually had muscle. Yesterday morning he swore it had been flat over his small gut, but now a pair of pectorals sat proudly above a slightly reduced stomach, his nipples a bit larger and more prominent. Even his arms looked a little thicker as they flexed and unflexed while his hands explored his body. Something was happening to him and he knew it should worry him, but it didn&#39;t. It felt right.<br />
<br />
He hopped in the shower and lathered up. The body wash smelled like Todd, which probably shouldn&#39;t be surprising considering it was his bathroom, but it still brought unbidden images into Dave&#39;s head. Todd laying naked on top of him, their cocks pressed together, lips meeting in a hungry kiss. He felt a stirring and it wasn&#39;t long before he had a soapy hand around his cock and was pumping furiously. He felt like he had the libido of a teenager and his cock definitely was thicker. With a growl deep in his throat he came, splattering the tile wall with a generous load of his cum. He quickly wiped it free and down the drain before finishing his shower.<br />
<br />
After toweling off he stepped ack into the apartment proper, Todd had vanished, probably back to his bedroom to get dressed. Dave followed suit and headed to his new cubby hole. He wondered if his clothes would even fit right. The changes to his body weren&#39;t drastic but they were noticeable. He briefs stretched fine, though his jeans hugged his rear a bit tighter they still fit. The tee he pulled on was an odder experience. A bit tight across the chest and even the sleeves hugged his upper arms in a way it had never done before. He flexed one arm and felt the fabric stretch a little around his bicep. He had biceps. His arms didn&#39;t have much tone, but they had bulked up, much like his chest. He finished getting dressed and left the room.<br />
<br />
Todd was back out, sitting on the couch in skinny jeans and a pink polo unbuttoned at the chest. The clothes did little to hide his physique and Dave felt that familiar sensation rising between his legs. He was not going to jerk off three times this morning. He tried to think of something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plans today?&quot; Todd asked, looking over the back of the couch at Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just gonna get a couple of boxes of my stuff from the apartment before Cher decides to toss it in a fit.&quot; Dave was already heading to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want company?&quot; Todd asked, but Dave just shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I want to handle her alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, just wait a sec.&quot; Todd got to his feet and walked into the kitchen, he produced a pair of twenties from his wallet on the counter and held them out to Dave. &quot;Stop by the store and pick up some beers on the way home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave walked over and took the bills from Todd. &quot;Sure thing.&quot; Then as if it was the most natural thing in the world, and indeed was something he had done with exes in the past when given an errand to run and on his way out, he leaned in and kissed Todd right on the lips. It was a quick peck, reflexive, but he blushed deeply once he noticed what he did. &quot;Sorry.. I..&quot; He gulped and pointed at the door, making for it with quick strides.<br />
<br />
Todd said nothing, only smiling as he watched Dave leave.</p>
