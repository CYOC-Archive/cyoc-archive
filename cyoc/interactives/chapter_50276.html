<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: Sorry about the absurd lateness compared to my original clipped pace. Been under <br />
stress lately. And I've been finding myself double guessing myself a lot lately too. And I've <br />
been having attacks of indecision.)<br />
<br />
&quot;speaking of being careful.&quot; Mr. P spoke up, &quot;I think Master you should be fixing the front <br />
gate.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;It can't have kitten so I'd say it's fixed already.&quot; Jensen laughed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious Master.&quot; Mr. P said, &quot;That gate needs to be seriously upgraded if you want the <br />
pack and the pups to be safe! We can't have humans wandering in tralala anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That gate always worked before and it can work now.&quot; Jensen replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was before we were hiding, what, thirty wolves here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty six counting you.&quot; Jenny corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty nine once we bring my family to be part of the pack.&quot; Fran said enjoying the image <br />
of her family as part of the pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is, we have a lot of wolves living on the grounds now, not to mention the deer <br />
we're going to have breeding in our backyard. We really should have it upgraded so it <br />
obscures more of the few inside...&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked at Jensen who nodded, &quot;I'll order the construction crew tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart said, &quot;The she wolves and males can likely get it done faster with sheer muscle <br />
power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True but this'll require a professional touch,&quot; Jenny said, &quot;If need be we can just dare the <br />
contractor to head the operation then forget about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;If he choses transform then we'd have another she-wolf on our hands, as <br />
lovely as that would be I'd rather have Fran's family be the only new additions we'll be <br />
having.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Jenny nodded. &quot;I understand. We'll just have the grotesques, keep a silent <br />
unmoving eye on them then in case someone realizes there -shouldn't- be wolf people <br />
walking around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin meanwhile just watched entertained as Alice balanced herself on Mr. P's <br />
back as Darla and Martha did their hardest to cease Alice's antics.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also,&quot; Mr. P said not worrying in the least of the glass Alice dancing on his back, <br />
&quot;Something I've been meaning to bring up since you brought me into the pack yesterday.&nbsp; I <br />
think there's something off about that one called Zackery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone off?&quot; Hope asked curious.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;He seem relatively fine to me this morning considering.&quot; Isabelle said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think there's something wrong with him?&quot; Grace asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the way he's acting,&quot; Mr. P said, &quot;He doesn't seem to act quite like the rest. He never <br />
addresses you as 'Master' Master, and his attitude seems to have more to it than at first <br />
glance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen laughed, &quot;Well, Zylphia was my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was our friend too.&quot; Grace said, &quot;We all looked out for each other. You could have <br />
picked out anyone for your friends Master, but you picked us, you could have picked other <br />
friends but you didn't Master, we were always grateful for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee said nothing, slightly annoyed at her 'chair' having opinions of their own. But then <br />
thought of something, &quot;It shouldn't be possible for them to be different. After all, <br />
everyone in the pack was given the clause to be loyal to Master and the pack. Zack should <br />
be no different from anyone.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I theory yes.&quot; Mr P said. &quot;But you can't deny what I just said. He -does- act differently <br />
from any of the other males from what I've seen, AND he doesn't address Master as <br />
'Master' ever.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is odd...&quot; Jensen tried to think back to the exact wording of the Transform or Dare <br />
that had been used on his former inner circle of friends. It was hard, there had been so <br />
many, so many now that had been transformed into either part of the pack or servants of <br />
the pack that it had become a salad of words to mentally track down the precise wording <br />
of each.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may be so bold Master.&quot; Fran said.<br />
<br />
This actually distracted Darla for a moment since she had been focused on Alice she <br />
hadn't noticed her twin come up with something. She accidently bumped into Martha and <br />
both ended up falling on their tales. 'Ugh... the sooner Samantha and Abbey are pups and <br />
we divide them among the three of us the better.' <br />
<br />
Fran thought the same but continued, &quot;It is perfectly possible that we overlooked <br />
something when Alexandra spoke the Dare to your clink. We -had- by that point <br />
converted the entire mansion's staff and your family into loyal members of the Big Bad wolf <br />
pack. Following that, it's perfectly possible that the wording might have been sloppy in <br />
hindsight. When a criminal begins to succeed on a spree of crimes, they tend to get over <br />
confident, becoming more reckless and arrogant in their actions. That's normally how you <br />
catch such criminals, by them being over confident once they've caught up a string of <br />
wins.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen didn't like being explain this in such a manner by one of his mates, but at the same <br />
time he couldn't exactly deny the logic of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you're saying we -might- have missed something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Fran and Darla both bowed, allow Alice to use Darla as a gymnastic bar and <br />
leap over her as Martha did a ill fated jumping skid to try and match her, Marcy and Kevin <br />
wondering how long this could go on. One of Martha's heads bumped into a wall the other <br />
head then gently licking the right head's sore nose. <br />
<br />
Kaylee said, &quot;But if he wasn't effected, why wouldn't his parents have called the police? Or <br />
why hasn't he called the police himself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't say I didn't find the set up you had here enticing even before you had us play the <br />
game Master.&quot; Hope said. <br />
<br />
Grace then said, &quot;I think Zylphia said her parents were going to be out of town for a while, <br />
apparently her parents trust her to look after himself in that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't prove that he ISN'T forgotten or that he ISN'T loyal to the pack or Master.&quot; <br />
Kaylee pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;It merits an investigation though.&quot; Said the two former police officers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say so.&quot; Mr. P said. <br />
<br />
&quot;And don't forget.&quot; Fran added, &quot;Unlike the other males, well, until Roger and Lawrence got <br />
their back I guess from Margot's upgrade, Zackery still has his turn he can use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen didn't like that combination one bit at all. The idea of someone within his pack that <br />
wasn't bound to use the game only to further the pack didn't sit well with him at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grace, Hope, 'Belle, ten-hut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Kaylee's chair dispersed, causing the Alpha Female to nearly fall on her tail <br />
in surprise.<br />
<br />
The three she wolves with doubles of Kaylee's body stood at attention perfectly with their <br />
arms at their sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to keep an eye on Zackery, if he does, or says anything suspicious, report it to <br />
me, -at once!-  Also, Hope, get Alexandra and see if she can remember the precise <br />
wording of the Transform used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The three said together like well trained troopers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while you're at it, brainstorm to see if any of you can remember the exact wording.&quot; <br />
Kaylee said behind, only sorry he didn't have her stick and helmet. <br />
<br />
The clink turned around at once and replied, &quot;Yes Alpha Female!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Said one FBI Agent to another who had both had the bad luck of getting stuck with <br />
double shifts that day, about a thousand miles from Glendale. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Said his work buddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't believe whose calling again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UFO nut who made it somehow through the screening or full of himself CIA agent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, vague question, remember the woman from day before yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wanted to know why we weren't doing more to rescue her daughter held by a drug <br />
lord in Mexico?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No the other one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one we had to explain to twice that the cost guard handled people lost at sea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no, the OTHER other one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The old lady who-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. The woman married to the cop out in the boonies who thought we had hired <br />
her husband to go to Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... that one... what about her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's calling us again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrific.&quot; Groaned the second FBI agent, having to deal with the twelfth agitated person <br />
who had never read one word on what the FBI actually did since this morning....<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Marcine said to the new buck, &quot;Smell our scene Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smell our scent Eve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I smell your scent... Marcine.&quot; Replied the buck, the concept of 'name' rather than just <br />
scent swimming in his simplistic animal brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I smell your scent... Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the scent of our herd, with this scent... we'll gather the herd... And your scent will <br />
help gather it as well.&quot; Said Jack, &quot;And we shall provide for the Big Bad Wolf Pack, as is our <br />
honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wolves?&quot; Eve now said in clear alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;As is our honor, our duty, our purpose.&quot; Said Jack nuzzling Eve, his own mind now <br />
having swam in and having dissolved into a sea that was the game as Marcine's had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Duty? Purpose?&quot; Adam asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duty. What we must do. Purpose. What we exist to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Purpose...&quot; Eve repeated the concept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duty...&quot; Adam repeated.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
When Beatrice came in for a later morning snack, what she hadn't expected to find was <br />
Pearl with several empty glass bottles around her. Looking totally blasted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl?&quot; The plain green she wolf so the pearl wolf and fellow errand girl to Alpha Female, <br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm just PEACHY! Really! Just peachy!&quot; Pearl said smiling and with slightly dull eyes. <br />
&quot;Wanna sit down and have a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Pearl... if this is about mating with Zack before finding out what kind of wolf he was... I <br />
really really REALLY think this is REALLY overboard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't be a party pooper! I'm just enjoying myself! Maybe if I'm lose enough the Master <br />
will take ME next!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think Master really likes that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we know? What do we know about Master other than he used to be Jenny Smith <br />
and that of course that he is Master? Come on, have a drink with me, it'll make for a <br />
amusing sub scene while the stuff with the main plot gets under way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said would you like to share a drink Miss Buttersworth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My last name wasn't Miss Buttersworth...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, the author never gave you one!&quot; Pearl then spun on the chair a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are completely blasted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to have the mother of all hang overs later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's going to NOT be pleasant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We I guess-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna get married-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?! NO! I MEANT LIKE FAMILY! Like we all are now!&quot; Beatrice took a few steps back <br />
and put the table between herself and Pearl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're now fun.&quot; Pearl pouted.<br />
<br />
Beatrice thought, maybe she could have a few drink (and count how many just to be on <br />
the safe side) if only to keep an eye on Pearl until the poison in Pearl system ran it's <br />
course.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's my plan for removing Lawrence from the equation.&quot; Said June hanging onto <br />
Zackery's back, once again in the bathroom with the shower curtain meant just to keep <br />
the steam from ruining the wooden floors without a door in the way. &quot;We can do Roger too <br />
if you'd like, and maybe Ulysses for good measure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no point to Ulysses. And with Roger's sister, I'd have to agree with what you said <br />
Pearl said about it might damage cause and effect or the she wolves sense of plausible <br />
denial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it when you speak like that, you sound just like Master.&quot; June whispered in one of <br />
his ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you DO want me to go through with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep your voice down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Zackery dear... but... why?! Lawrence and Roger's upgrades means the she wolves <br />
have no -need- to let what happened before slide!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have bent the rules more than once, but I don't cheat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pst. Typical male ego.&quot; June said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious, besides, what happens if something goes wrong? I could end up a busty <br />
Asian fountain in the front yard. If this is found out.&quot; Jackery thought, Jensen at his core <br />
was still Jennifer in theory... but her personality seemed enlarged, and made... well, <br />
badder. Then again, she WAS the Big Bad Wolf now... what did Zackery expect? <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay dear.&quot; June said in a calm passive voice, in her heard balancing on weather or not to <br />
go ahead for Zackery's sake with or without his approval. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I was sure he was going to be carried off the field on a stretcher... &quot; Ulysses said, the <br />
purple wolf watching the end of the film. <br />
<br />
Sarah looked at him and smiled and rubbed his head fur, &quot;Not every story based in the <br />
'real world' needs to have an unhappy ending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it's kinda based on a true story.&quot; Jasmine injected, the sea green wolf being the <br />
big fan of the film present.<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked and looked at her fellow she wolf, &quot;Really? Which parts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah chose not to press the matter in case it turned out to be a unhappy ending for <br />
Ulysses. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to what?&quot; Caroline asked sounding surprised at Nicole's request.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to petition Master to have me use one of the rooms or part of the back or front <br />
yard to start training the she-wolves and Ulysses in self defense. My senshi said I was a <br />
natural and prodigy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you're NOT a licensed martial arts instructor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? You're not a licensed contractor... and I know enough to teach you and everyone <br />
else the basics without dislocating your own arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dark blue furred she wolf sigh, &quot;Okay, I'll ask Master. ....&quot; Caroline looked at the <br />
various she wolves, the vast majority now gathered around stroking the new and improved <br />
Roger and Lawrence. Maxine and Margot both trying to ride Lawrence's shoulders. &quot;THis is <br />
us now isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is us now. Our clothes, IDs, and others memories of us are all ashes or never were. <br />
We've remade the house from the inside out to accommodate for our new sizes. And now <br />
you're thinking of starting a karate club... this is us now. The Big Bad pack. We're in for <br />
the long haul, a life time haul. This is our present and future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole said with absolute confidence she was known for. &quot;You bet it is. Nothing is going to <br />
change that now. I'm sure of it.&quot;</p>
