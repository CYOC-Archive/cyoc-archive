<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Really, it was all just one big blur. Stuck in a giant fish-tank for days on end, the irregular feedings, the even less frequent cleanings. The endless boredom, the lack of new surroundings or any sort of intellectual or social stimulation, being denied even the basic pleasure of jacking off when he was finally left in private. (And oh how he tried, but nothing worked. Rubbing his groin where his dick used to be, he only felt plain fish-scales. Playing with his own nipples only led to horniness and frustration without release. Eventually, Chad just gave up on trying altogether.)<br />
<br />
But Chad did take notice the day his tank was covered over and loaded onto a truck. He was acutely aware of every moment that he was left in the dark, then haplessly sloshed around, and increasingly terrified of what was to become of him. The helplessness of not being able to control his own fate, or even to breathe air long enough to make his voice heard, had long since set in and become a fixture of his sorry excuse for a life. But now, that constant helplessness and hopelessness was mingled with abject fear.<br />
<br />
When rumbling of the truck stopped, Chad was not surprised to feel his tank being moved off the truck and set down somewhere else. He was, however, surprised when the cover lifted off—immediately blinding him with the brightness of the midday sun, a sun he hadn&#39;t seen in, what, was it weeks or months now? he couldn&#39;t tell—and the side of his tank was simultaneously flung open, spilling Chad and all of his filthy fish-water into a much larger pool.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was a pool—an immense swimming pool, lined with bright blue-green walls, but filled with a pure, fresh, beautifully breathable salt-water (and not some chlorinated chemical concoction). It was a balm to his skin and scales and gills, and Chad immediately perked up and took stock of his surroundings. The pool was huge, and it had some kind of fountain built into the center of it, a statue of a godly stone Poseidon rising just above the surface, trident in hand, while two tailed tritons coiled at his feet and blew conch shells. Salt-water spilled from this fountain into the pool, and beyond that, Chad could see, much to his great astonishment, that channels cut into the ground led to yet more swimming pools connected to this one. It was an entire complex of pools that he could now explore! Compared to the confines of the fish-tank, it was a fucking paradise.<br />
<br />
But, still, where exactly was he? On all sides, the pools were surrounded by paved or tiled walkways, along with lots of ornate and expensive-looking deck-furniture: stone tables and benches, more statues and sculptures, lots of urns and vessels in a very Grecian style, and everywhere a plethora of deck-chairs, umbrellas, and other conveniences for swimmers. Only, there was nobody here. The place was deserted, except for the workmen who were now taking the tank away. <br />
<br />
Chad swam up to the edge of the pool, sucked some water into his mouth, and pushed with his arms, lifting his torso out of the water. He could see that the whole yard where the pools were, and it was truly vast, was surrounded by a high hedge (he could catch glimpses of iron gates and fencing here and there), and in one direction, rising above the hedge, stood an enormous mansion. So that was it, then, he realized. He was in some other filthy-rich fuck&#39;s back-yard, and it just so happened that THIS backyard was a gilded cage ideally suited to confining a sea-creature.<br />
<br />
Fan-fucking-tastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, you&#39;re fantastic!&quot; said a husky, feminine voice from somewhere inside the nearest stretch of hedge. Chad turned and saw, standing in an open gateway, a woman who was probably twice his age. She was attractive enough in a MILFy sort of way, if you could get past the bleach-blonde hair and the obvious signs of plastic surgery. At least she didn&#39;t have a bad orange spray-tan. But she was wearing expensive clothing (white capris pants and sheer white blouse with a lacy black bra visible underneath), expensive sunglasses and sun-hat, expensive shoes, expensive jewelry, and carrying an expensive little lap-dog in her expensive purse. And Chad could already tell that she carried herself like someone always got her way.<br />
<br />
Chad wanted to reply, but the best he could do was burble up a sputter of artificial seawater and slide back down into the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, don&#39;t go!&quot; said the woman, running up to the poolside. &quot;Please, I just want to introduce myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad remained on the surface, careful to keep his mouth and gills submerged, so that his nose was just at the surface of the water and his eyes were above it. He cast a dark and angry glare up at the woman, blew some bubbles through his nose, and pointed insistently at his gills while also making angry &quot;glub-glub&quot; noises with his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you speak English?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glub.&quot; Chad nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can&#39;t you talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GLUB-BLUB.&quot; Accompanied by another angry glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t breathe air!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad allowed his expression to soften, and he nodded again.<br />
<br />
The woman put her hands on her hips and muttered to herself, &quot;Well, that just won&#39;t do at all. I paid good money to have my lifelong merman fantasy fulfilled, God damn it, and it simply won&#39;t work out between us if you can only breathe water and I can only breathe air!&quot; Spinning on a very expensive high-heeled shoe, she started fast-marching for the gate in the hedge. Over her shoulder to Chad, she called back, &quot;Now you wait right there, honey, and I&#39;ll be back with something to help, and also wearing something a little bit more comfortable!&quot; Then, with a girlish squeal of excitement, she disappeared.<br />
<br />
And Chad was left in the pool, thinking to himself, what in the actual fuck . . . ?<br />
<br />
*          *          *          *          *          *          *          *          *<br />
<br />
It was only half an hour later when the woman reappeared, now minus the dog and purse and high-heels and instead wearing expensive-looking sandals and a downright scandalous string-bikini in seafoam-green that left nothing of her finely sculpted figure to the imagination. Chad groaned internally: the woman may have been in her forties, but she was undeniably hot, and Chad hadn&#39;t laid eyes on anything this sexy in he-didn&#39;t-know how long. It was both a damn shame and a real pain that there was nothing at all he could do to act on the stirrings of lust he was now experiencing in spite of himself.<br />
<br />
The woman kicked off her sandals, took off her hat and sunglasses and some of her more dangly bracelets and necklaces, and set them aside; then she knelt by the lip of the pool and called out, &quot;Oh Mr. Merman, come here please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad surfaced and looked at her questioningly.<br />
<br />
The woman looked as if she desperately wanted to touch Chad, or to jump into the pool and simply embrace him, but she held herself back. &quot;You aren&#39;t . . . ferocious, are you? You won&#39;t hurt me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad stared blankly.<br />
<br />
The woman seemed to take that as some kind of confirmation, and so she reached out a hand, and Chad could see that she was clutching something in it: a piece of jewelry, a little seashell on a gold chain. &quot;There&#39;s a good boy, now. Or, man . . . or fish-man. Whatever. Go on, take it and put it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was not about to be decorated like some rich cunt&#39;s plaything, so he answered by splashing her in the face. She jumped up to her feet and huffed and &quot;ooh&#39;d&quot; angrily and stamped one foot like a child. &quot;Ooh, naughty fish-boy! Bad merman! The necklace is magic, it will help you breathe air!&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing that, Chad&#39;s eyes widened, and he dove for the trinket and quickly slipped it over his head. He then rose to the surface and took a big gasp of air, and was pleased to discover that he felt perfectly fine. His gills weren&#39;t drying out!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now there!&quot; said the woman, half annoyed and half pleased with herself. Smug, really, was the best way to describe how she sounded. &quot;Isn&#39;t that so much better? Now,&quot; she sat down on the edge of the pool, dangling her legs in the water, and patted the spot next to her, &quot;why don&#39;t you take a seat next to me, and we can get to know each other better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was all too happy to oblige now. After all, he hadn&#39;t been able to breathe air or say more than a handful of words to anyone since this whole fiasco started, so a bit of conversation sounded like the best thing ever. Plus, he had questions—lots of questions.<br />
<br />
Only, to his great astonishment and anger, when he tried to speak, Chad found that he still could not speak. He couldn&#39;t utter a single word! The necklace was allowing him to breathe air, but it also robbed him of his voice!<br />
<br />
Still, being able to get out of the water was better than being stuck under it, so Chad pulled himself out of the pool and sat down next to his—benefactor? Captor? Owner? He tried speaking, but could only open and close his mouth and gesture at his neck and at the necklace.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked the woman. &quot;Still shy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wild gesticulation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. So you can&#39;t talk after all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angry glares and pointing.<br />
<br />
The woman sighed. &quot;Well, we&#39;ll just have to work on that. The necklace was the best I could do on short notice. It&#39;s a surprisingly complicated bit of witchcraft, if I do say so myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad froze. He pointed at the woman, and then did his best to mime a pointy hat, a warty nose, and flying on a broomstick, followed by a questioning gaze. [You&#39;re a witch!?] he seemed to be saying.<br />
<br />
She laughed (and, yes, it did sound a bit like a cackle). &quot;Yes, I&#39;m a witch. My name is Vanessa. Vanessa Bishop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another blank stare from Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;My foremother was the first woman executed at the Salem Trials in 1692.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s face falls. [Oh.]<br />
<br />
&quot;There, now, don&#39;t look sad,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;It&#39;s ancient history. And we Bishops have done pretty well for ourselves in the last couple of centuries. Now I can call myself a rich witch-bitch!&quot; she giggled. &quot;And I can buy whatever I can&#39;t get with may magic. Like my brand-new, handsome pet merman. Now, let&#39;s see, what will I call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad tried to say his own name, and when that didn&#39;t work, he tried spelling it out with sign-language, but for whatever reason, he just couldn&#39;t make the shapes with his hands. Some charm in the necklace was preventing him from even making a simple &quot;C&quot; shape, as if it was scrambling his ability to communicate in human language!<br />
<br />
But Vanessa, clearly not understanding the gestures, interrupted him by deciding, &quot;Let&#39;s just keep it simple. I&#39;ll call you Neptune, like a proper sea-god.&quot; She ran a hand over Chad&#39;s muscular chest and sighed contentedly. &quot;Yes, indeed. You&#39;ll do, very nicely. Better than anything I could have created with any charms of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, she stood up and said, &quot;So, let&#39;s start with some ground rules, capisce?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad froze. Uh-oh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Number one: you&#39;re mine. You&#39;ll do what I say, when I say it, no complaints, and in return, I&#39;ll do nice things for you, like giving you that magic necklace so you can breathe above water. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad responded by trying to take the necklace off, only to find (much to his horror) that he couldn&#39;t. The enchantment on the necklace also meant that it wouldn&#39;t allow itself to be removed! Vanessa cackled again when Chad finally stopped trying to pry away the cursed jewelry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re funny, fishboy. Did you really think that would work with an enchanted talisman? Oh, silly Neptune.&quot; She grinned wide, and while she thought about her next commandment, she tapped her cheek with a green-painted fingernail. &quot;Hm, let&#39;s see now, number two, number two. Ah; yes! Rule number two is fidelity. You&#39;re my little fishy boy-toy now, which means, no playing with the pool-girl or any of the other servants. If you try to cheat on me, there will be consequences. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hah, thought Chad to himself. Cheat, how? He didn&#39;t have a dick. Vanessa was bound to be disappointed when she found out that little caveat. And from the way she was behaving, Chad was pretty sure she didn&#39;t know. So he didn&#39;t make any griping or complaining gestures; he just folded his arms and nodded his tacit agreement.<br />
<br />
Vanessa smiled, pleased. &quot;Good. Well, I&#39;ve got some business to attend to, so I&#39;m going to leave you for a little while now, and you can get to know your new home. Go on; explore. But I&#39;ll be back later tonight, so we can have dinner together and really get to know each other. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad kept his expression neutral as he slid back into the pool. What was tonight going to bring?</p>
