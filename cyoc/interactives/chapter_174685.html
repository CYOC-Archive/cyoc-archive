<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sacrora chuckles as you continue to gaze in horror at Kate in her reduced state.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, she’s still there, if only barely,” she reassures as she moves a hand to give the breast with Kate’s face on it a squeeze.  Kate’s eyes unfocus and she lets out a soft moan as the breast deforms within her grip in a rubbery manner.<br />
<br />
“I make sure I keep just enough mass essence in all of my trophies so that they don’t fully lose themselves even after I devour their forms.  However, I’ve found that humans don’t think too well in this state.  It must be a side effect of being altered so much, being brought to the brink of latex devolution.  Occasionally I still lost a few to full crossover and had to consume or release them, but that hasn’t happened in a feeding cycle or two,” Sacrora explains with a reptilian smile.<br />
<br />
“You’re a monster!” you scream without thought.  You wish Tex was here to give you some advice, but she seems to have dash off behind you before Sacrora got too close.<br />
<br />
“Aw, you’re too kind,” Sacrora laughs.  “It’s only fitting that prey should be afraid of predator.  But don’t worry, I promise it’s not as bad as you think.  You’ll find out for yourself before too long.  I’ll even make sure to keep you next to your friend here.  But in the meantime, I think there’s another way you can be together…”<br />
<br />
She trails of in focus while the hand holding Kate’s breast pulls it downwards.  As it does, the breast moves down Sacrora’s back, the other face-breasts moving around to make room for it during it’s journey.  Before long, Kate’s breast is at the bottom right corner of Sacrora’s back, facing you.  She moves closer to you, putting Kate’s face uncomfortably close to your crotch.<br />
<br />
“It’s a bit cliché, at least for me, but I might as well start off this feast with the classics.  What do you say?  One last suck for the road?  It’s probably your last chance after all,” Sacrora says with a wicked grin.<br />
<br />
You open your mouth to speak, but you can’t even find the words.  You’re a mixture of surprised, confused, and disgusted.  But also, you wouldn’t even be able to take her up on her offer anyway, though you don’t think explaining that would help matters.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, not quite sure how to respond?  That’s the reaction they normally had in cycles past.  Though most allegedly high-minded humans eventually took my offer up once they fully came to appreciate their predicament.  Here, maybe you don’t like it like that and this would help.”<br />
<br />
She presses a finger against the middle of Kate’s breast where her nose would normally be.  Slowly, the finger sinks in as that region of breast liquefies around it.  Kate’s eyes roll back as her mouth goes slack.  As Sacrora withdraws her finger, the liquid latex slowly shifts and solidifies, taking the form of a pair of labia with an opening between them in the middle of the breast.<br />
<br />
Finally, you pull yourself together.<br />
<br />
“That’s… That’s horrible.  I would never…  Not like this.  You might as well just let me go or eat me now.  I’m not playing your sick games!” you shout.  Despite the brave face you put on, your heartbeat still thuds in your ears in the face of this terrifying creature.<br />
<br />
“Aw, still playing the hero, are we?” Sacrora grins.  “It’s always more fun when they require some convincing.  Who knows, maybe you’ll be the rare one who doesn’t give in.  Those are always the most fun to play with.  But are you sure you don’t want this?  Maybe a bit of encouragement would help.”<br />
<br />
One of the lowest arms of her snakes around toward your crotch.<br />
<br />
“Humans are still animals after all, and there are certain things all animals want.  That they need.  Are you sure you don’t want this?  Even if I…  Wait, what’s this?” she asks in confusion as her hand touches your smooth crotch.<br />
<br />
Her whole body shifts at once with shocking speed to put her face close to your crotch as she examines it intently.<br />
<br />
“What the-” she starts in surprise.  “Normally, it’s an extremity or facial feature that’s consumed first by the lower ones.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone who lost just this from a chance encounter with a beast or puddle.  I wonder…”<br />
<br />
Her reptilian tongue flicks outward and brushes your crotch, sending shivers throughout your body.  You try as best you can not to let the sensation arouse you.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t just normal essence consumption.  You already came in contact with one of the higher ones, maybe even a latex entity of deific status, didn’t you?” she asks, in between swipes of her tongue across the latex patch of your crotch.<br />
<br />
“It—was—Lascivia.” you manager to stammer out in between grunts as her tongue teases you, unable to concentrate on anything else.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh, that <i>would</i> make sense,” she says, still flitting her tongue in and out against you.  “She always played too much with her food, even for my tastes.  At least I do the decent thing of eating them properly when I’m done.  But taking this piece in particular away from you seems out of character for her.  I’d think she’d at least--”<br />
<br />
As she says this, the sensations become too much, and you find yourself getting aroused.  At once, the sinking feeling spreads throughout your body, accompanied by a warming tingle that makes your skin feel excitable to touch.  With your attempts to hold it back, it seems to come on even stronger, and it’s all to much for you to focus on a single part as your various features are subsumed by the latex flesh that spreads out to cover you.  Within moments, Sacrora’s tongue is flicking against your restored member, though the sensation isn’t quite enough to fully get you off.<br />
<br />
“Ah, this seems more on-brand for her,” you hear Sacrora say.  “Though I’m curious how exactly she managed this.  Normally I can taste the inner workings of essence re-fabrications, but the flavor of this is too complex.”<br />
<br />
With the lust overpowering logical thought, you can’t help but do much more than thrust against her tongue as it inspects you.  It doesn’t help.<br />
<br />
“Hmm.  I’d like to play with your more, but I have to admit, this has gotten a different kind of appetite up in me.  The only way to fully understand would be…”<br />
<br />
Her tongue wraps around you.  You feel yourself lifted into the air and something warm and rubbery begin to surround you.  A part of you is worried about what’s happening, but it’s overwhelmed by the all-encompassing lust this form imbues in you.  You find yourself writhing helplessly for release as you’re devoured.<br />
<br />
Soon, the latex is pressing against you from all sides.  You feel the vague hints of something pulling at you wherever it makes contact, but it can’t quite make purchase, like a grip just barely slipping off when it begins to tug at you.  The pressure increases.  You try to squirm as best you can as you seek release, and though you can find some friction from the surface pressing against you, it’s difficult to move enough to make use of it.<br />
<br />
Slowly, as pressure increases, you feel something starting to give...</p>
