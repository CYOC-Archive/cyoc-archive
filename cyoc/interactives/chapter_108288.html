<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s mind reeled at the possibilities. Imagine the job prospects for someone who doesn’t need equipment – who can move earth and lay concrete with their bare hands, or weld metal, or even fuse carbon. Jeff could make himself a human power-plant and provide energy for the world! And he’d get all the credit for such great skills, because he would have the properties of those objects whilst still looking completely human, completely like himself. Amazing!<br />
Jeff scrolled past option after option, leaning closer and closer into the screen as the opportunities blossomed in his mind. <br />
However, whatever Jeff found just didn&#39;t seem enough. He wanted to be a fantastic asset to the world, beloved by all. It would take a very special kind of object.<br />
That&#39;s when it hit him. What do we need most in the entire world? The world itself! Mother Earth gives us everything we need for life. Jeff decided he would replace the Earth, as a human planet. <br />
The boy entered in the details in to the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
He would become as large as the Earth but remain essentially human, conforming to the &quot;function but not form&quot; programme.<br />
In addition, he would replace the real Earth.<br />
The transformation would last for one week, and reality would shift around it so that nobody would notice the change and panic. Only he would remain aware. He did hope, however, that people would call him Father Earth rather than Mother Earth.<br />
With the perameters set, Jeff hit &quot;confirm&quot; and waited.<br />
<br />
After a moment when the programme loaded, Jeff suddenly felt a rush. His whole body became energised. His muscles felt like they were buzzing and his bones ached in a strangely pleasent way. With a grunt, Jeff grew a few feet taller, straining his clothes. After a moment of rest, Jeff burst out of his tight clothing and hit his head on the ceiling. His hardening cock flopped out of his ripping underwear in the process.  Jeff had never felt more alive, more powerful, and there was more to come. He pressed his hands to the ceiling and gave it a shove. At the same time, his body expanded yet again. His powerful hands pushed the ceiling and roof apart above him, making way for his head. With a creak, he felt his expanding ass fall through the floor. He was now sitting in the living room with his head poking out of the roof and his knees had each burst into his parents room and brothers room. Jeff moaned as he felt something wedge into his ass from the fall. It must be the sofa. His rectal muscles were naturally flexing and pulling it in.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;&#39;s brother, who was downstairs watching TV, never knew what hit him. By the time the ringing in his ears from the loud bang of the giant ass coming through the ceiling had stopped, he and the whole sofa seemed to be in a warm, slightly damp place and he couldn&#39;t fathom why or how. Jeff&#39;s sister found this hilarious, until he shifted his weight and his giant balls plopped down on her.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;&#39;s growth didn&#39;t stop there of course. The boy expanded more and more. Soon he was sitting on the whole estate. He took a deep breath, the air getting thin and moist clouds close to his head. Evidently, reality hadn&#39;t caught up yet, as people were running around screaming and pointing up at the giant naked boy. Jeff however just felt powerful, and leaned back on one elbow which crushed his school, and started jerking off his gigantic cock.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Jeff started seeing stars, and clouds were softly raining onto his skin. It was around this time that people below heard a roar before being pelted by giant globules of semen. Jeff felt so empowered - he could wash away a whole city just by orgasming.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled over and hugged the Earth. He was the right size to wrap his body around it, his knees sinking into the oceans and his hands pressed into the land. The Earth felt so soft from here, like a huge pillow. Jeff&#39;&#39;s growth slowed from here, giving him time to give his dick a brief rinse in the ocean so he wouldn&#39;t have to spend the week with it covered in dry cum. <br />
<br />
As Jeff reached his full size, the Earth started to glow. It seemed to dissolve right before Jeff&#39;s eyes. That&#39;s when Jeff realised that he was somehow still breathing. What had once been the Earth was now Jeff&#39;&#39;s own atmosphere and Jeff was now the Earth. <br />
As reality shifted, Jeff took Earth&#39;s orbital position. <br />
<br />
Jeff marvelled at the view. Stars as far as the eye could see. The sun glaring through his atmosphere. Satalites orbiting his body. The moon currently hanging far, far above his left hip. He was the most powerful being in the solar system, and all of humanity needed him. <br />
Looking down at himself, Jeff saw nets of lights shining from the parts of him that were in shadow. Even as he moved to see them and his chin cast a shadow on his chest, lights appeared there. They were cities!<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t even see the people, they were so small to him now.<br />
It dawned on Jeff that he was starting to get itchy in places. If he scratched, he&#39;d murder thousands. The itching came from all of the activity now happening on his epidermis. Loggers were cutting down his bodyhairs, miners were boaring into his skin, contractors were damming some of his sweat-pools, spelunkers were exploring his bellybutton and rectum. Animals were burrowing into him, farms were being established almost everywhere, large portions of his soft, supple skin were being paved over. It itched and itched. Factories and cars were starting to turn his air stale and bitter. Jeff tried not to think about it. He was here for everyone now. His body was their resource.<br />
On his surface, life went on as normal for the people of Earth. Those who had been crushed by Jeff&#39;s  growth had been restored like nothing had happened, because Jeff was always a planet to them. Nobody had noticed a change, though some of history had been altered accordingly.</p>
