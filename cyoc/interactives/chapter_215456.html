<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So the twins waited for their friends to turn up, before 8pm when they were expecting their friends, Max and Ricky got changed into their pyjamas, Max was wearing a white t-shirt and brown pyjama pants while Ricky was wearing a black hoodie and matching pair of black shorts.<br />
<br />
At 20:05, the first one of their friends arrived, it was Stanley, he’s your average nerdy kid, he was top of most of his classes due to his intellect, him and Max would spend hours playing video games together, he was well verse on nerdy and geeky culture.<br />
<br />
Max and Stanley have been friends since the third grade, Stanley is 5’5 with short brown hair, he was already wearing his pyjamas which consisted of a red pair of pyjama pants and matching stripy red and white shirt with red sliders.<br />
<br />
Ricky has known and been around Stanley since he’s been best friends with Max, Ricky can’t stand Stanley he thought of him as an annoying nerd.<br />
<br />
Max and Stanley done their signature handshake that looked cool to them but Ricky thought it was the lamest thing ever “hey Max, hi Ricky, tonight is gonna be a bomb” said Stanley sounding excited,<br />
<br />
“Yeah when other people get here” muttered Ricky under his breath while Max was more nice to his friend than his brother was “dude tonight is gonna be one to remember, I got something I have to show everyone”<br />
<br />
The three then headed to the twins bedroom, the whole time Stanley tried to guess what Max’s surprise was, Ricky was sick of the guesses while Max just kept dodging the question.<br />
<br />
The next person arrived at 20:12, it was Sam, Sam was a stereotypical tomboy, she had short hair, didn’t wear makeup, only had guy friends and was seen as one of the boys in her friend group, she either wore gender natural or masculine clothes, her and her mom would get in constant arguments around her personality and her tomboyishness.<br />
<br />
Sam and Ricky became good friends after the two would spend a lot of time in detention with each other, Sam is 5’4 with messy dirty blonde hair and a boyish look to her body, she was wearing a pair of mens grey sweatpants and grey t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Sam and Max were friends too, they weren’t as close Ricky and her were but they were friends.<br />
<br />
They opened the door to see Sam standing there in her pjs and white sneakers, she had her skateboard in one hand and a energy drink in the other “yo what’s up” she said as she let herself in.<br />
<br />
Her and Ricky bumped fists “I thought you would be fashionably late as always” said Ricky.<br />
<br />
She smirked “this ain’t Math, I don’t actually mind turning up here”<br />
<br />
“You ain’t even fashionably late to Math, you just never turn up” Max joked as the three laughed.<br />
<br />
Sam throw off her sneakers and dropped her skateboard on the floor carelessly before taking a swig of her energy drink, that’s when she spotted Stanley.<br />
<br />
The two locked eyes as Stanley gulped, he was one of the nerds that Sam liked to torment at school, there was even one embarrassing moment when she pantsed him in front of the whole class.<br />
<br />
Sam came up to him and gave him a big pat on the back “hey Stan the man, do you still wear those superhero undies” she teased, Stanley went bright red, Sam and Ricky both laughed Max was about to stick up for his friend when suddenly they heard a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
At 20:18, Rebecca was knocking on the door, Rebecca was a sweet and kind girl who knew how to stick up for herself, labelled ‘Mary Sue’ by her jealous classmates as she was smart, musically and artistically talented, she also had a nerdy side as she loved sci-fi and fantasy, she would also play video games with Max and Stanley.<br />
<br />
Max had been friends with Rebecca since 1st grade, the two were so close they would consider themselves move as family than friends, Rebecca was 5’3 and had shoulder length curly brown hair, she didn’t offend wear makeup or stay up to date with fashion trends, her face had few freckles and she was pale, Rebecca was wearing a purple baggy t-shirt with a pair of white pj pants, she was also wearing some brown slippers as she was dropped to the front door by her dad.<br />
<br />
Rebecca and Ricky didn’t get along, she would often stand up to him when he would tease Stanley, the two would often argue and they got to the point where they just stopped speaking to each other.<br />
<br />
Max and Rebecca hugged at the door “hiya Max” she came through the front door and waved at Stanley “hey Stanley, I love pjs” <br />
<br />
Stanley blushed “thanks Rebecca” it was painfully obvious to everyone but Rebecca that he had a crush on her, Max tried to convince him to tell her but he was always too shy.<br />
<br />
Ricky snd Rebecca locked eyes “Ricky” she said as she rolled her eyes as she walked past him, Ricky just ignored her.<br />
<br />
Sam and Rebecca have never met before so they introduced themselves, the five teens then went into the kitchen to grab some snacks while they waited for their final member of the sleepover.<br />
<br />
He arrived 20 minutes later at 20:40, it was Lucas, Ricky and Lucas have been friends since kindergarten, they’ve done everything together they are both on the same soccer team, Ricky has been on many trips with Lucas and his family, the two always hung out together, Lucas was like Ricky’s other twin.<br />
<br />
Lucas was 5’7 and had short blonde hair, he was in great shape and was very popular with the girls, his parents were wealthy so he was usually wearing the latest high fashion brand, he was into street wear and sports, he wasn’t as mean to other kids like Sam and Ricky were but he liked to crack jokes at other peoples expense, Lucas was wearing a designer white t-shirt with a matching of white shorts and he was noticeably wearing no shoes he was walking around in his socks.<br />
<br />
Max snd Lucas got on well, he was always in their house so Max was use to being around Lucas.<br />
<br />
Ricky and Lucas done their signature handshake which wasn’t much different than Max’s and Stanley’s but in Ricky’s head it was a lot cooler “how’s it going bro, I knew you would be late” said Ricky as he let Lucas in,<br />
<br />
“I’m not late, everyone else was just early” said Lucas, he raffled Max’s hair “Maxy boy, thanks for the invite”<br />
<br />
Sam and Lucas then bumped firsts “Everyone thought I was the one who was gonna be late” Sam said, even though she would never admit it to herself or Lucas, she had a slight crush on him, it was strange emotion for her to deal with as he was her first and only crush.<br />
<br />
“Come on Sam you’re getting as bad as Mr. Hives” Lucas liked Sam, he saw her as one of the boys.<br />
<br />
Rebecca and Lucas than head nodded at each other “Damn we got big brain here too, it’s going to be a wild night” big brain was Lucas’ nickname for Rebecca, the two became unlikely friends when they started sitting next to each other in science class.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure it will be, Lucas” she said in a dismissive tone before lightly laughing, Rebecca knew every girl in her grade had a crush on Lucas but she never got the hype around him.<br />
<br />
Than Lucas spotted Stanley “oh you’re that dude with superhero underpants” Stanley just blushed and wished the ground would swallow him up.<br />
<br />
With everyone finally at the sleepover, the twins took everyone up to their room.<br />
<br />
“So Max, what was that surprise, you can finally tell us” said Stanley who was very eager to find out.<br />
<br />
“It’s this” he said as he pulled out the Chronivac from his drawer, everyone looked confused expect for Rebecca.<br />
<br />
“That’s the Chronivac, it’s supposed to be able to change anyones body including their  age, gender and even species, but there’s no way it actually works” said Rebecca.<br />
<br />
Sam and Lucas were sceptical, Rebecca was fascinated while Stanley was blown away.<br />
<br />
Sam scuffed as she finished her energy drink can and she pulled out another one “no way something like that actually works” she said before burping.<br />
<br />
Ricky stepped in “honesty I thought it was a bunch of crap too until I saw it change Max’s shirt”<br />
<br />
“Alright than let’s see it work, what don’t you change something about all of us” said Lucas smugly.<br />
<br />
Max accepted the challenge, he opened up everyone’s tab: <br />

But before Max could make his change, his parents opened the door, Lauren and Geoffrey were the twins parents.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys we hope you all have fun” said Lauren softly.<br />
<br />
“But not too much fun, we knew their are girls here, so no funny business” said Geoffrey who was more stern than his wife.<br />
<br />
Max and Ricky were mortified that their parents would think something like that was gonna happen “you guys are so embarrassing” the twins whined in unison.<br />
<br />
Lauren ignored their whining “but we know we got some sensible boys and girls here” she said as she smiled at both Lucas and Rebecca but her face dropped slightly seeing Sam trying to force Stanley to drink her energy drink.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have fun for sure, thanks so much for having me Mr and Mrs E” said Lucas before winking at Lauren smoothly, she winked back.<br />
<br />
Their parents finally left, Ricky scrunched up his face “hey did you wink at my mom” said Ricky who was slightly pissed.<br />
<br />
“Hey forget about that, it’s time to prove that the Chronivac works” said Max.<br />
<br />
Max decided to</p>
