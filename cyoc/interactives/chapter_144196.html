<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily watched herself move across the lawn in a graceful dance and found she had to suppress a smile. The whole scene rather amusing, she wished that that it was actually her going out with Michael. Hoping Jacob didn&#39;t mess up her date too badly, she resisted the urge to wave goodbye as the two drove away.<br />
<br />
Alone, standing on what had been moments ago her front lawn, Emily looked down at her now pudgy fifteen-year-old male form. Her eyes drifting to the thing Kaitlyn had dug up, she tried again to get it to change her back. Finding she wasn&#39;t successful, she frowned and tried to remember what he sister had called the thing. Unable to recall, but thinking it was something like Toridor of Transformation, she huffed and shuffled over to the front steps.<br />
<br />
Her body now being heavier and the weight distribution being in different places than what she was used to, Emily started to sit down, but then started to pace back and forth. Trying to get used to moving about in Jay&#39;s body, unsure how long she would be stuck as a boy, she jumped, kicked, punched and did a couple other movements that eventually left her breathing heavily. Running her hand through her hair, much the same way Jacob did, Emily sat down on the steps and stared at the thing that had changed her. Shifting about, as she found sitting as Jay weird, she eventually settled on what she thought was an unflattering look.<br />
<br />
Legs spread, much in the same way Michael and the other boys he hung around sat, she leaned back, thinking. The Tubidor had some how made Jacob her and she him, she reasoned. Trying to sort how it had done so, Emily figured that if she could figure how then she could figure out the way to switch them back. Unable to do that, she eventually snapped, &quot;Stupid Kaitlyn. This all her fault. Her and her stupid,&quot; and trailing off, Emily glanced behind her.<br />
<br />
An idea coming to her, she muttered, &quot;Duh. Kaitlyn. This her stupid Tudor thingy. She would know how it works,&quot; and standing, she hefted herself up the couple steps, across the porch, started to let herself in, but stopped when she caught sight of her reflection and instead knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
A minute or two passed before the door opened and Emily found herself staring at her mom. Suddenly overcome, she almost cried out for her mom to help. But, certain that wouldn&#39;t go over too well, she tried to maintain an air of coolness as she said, Hey, Mrs Johnson. Um, is Kaitlyn available. I, um, need her assistance with something. Plus, she said she would help, which is why I, um, well, had originally came over, but, um, er, got side-tracked talking to myse-emily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom, not even catching what she&#39;d almost said at the end, smiled and told her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jacob. But Kaitlyn has a lot of homework too do. Maybe when she is done I could send her over. All right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Emily whispered as her mom bid her good day and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Turning away, Emily breathed deeply, trying to figure out why she&#39;d been holding her breath, but happy that she&#39;d been able to talk to her mom without giving anything away. Thinking how astute her mom was, amazed that she had caught wind that something was up, Emily ran her hand through her greasy hair and walked back across the porch. Wondering what she was too do until she could talk to Kaitlyn, she glanced in the direction of Jay&#39;s house and wondered if she could chill there until then.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts going to how she and Jacob used to such close friends until the point where they had simply drifted off into different interests, she walked down the steps and ambled up the walk. Deciding that going to Jay&#39;s house would be akin to him snooping through her private things, Emily wondered what she was to do while she waited. A noise from around the side of the house distracting her, Emily moved as quickly as she could over to it. Finding she was getting used to a heavier frame and the proper way to place her feet as she rounded the house, Emily was taken back when she saw her sister climbing down the trellis. And before she could stop herself, she stated, &quot;Mom says you&#39;re supposed to be doing your homework. You&#39;re going to be so busted when she find&#39;s you&#39;ve snuck out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn, giving her a sour look, studied her for a moment before saying, &quot;Who are you, my sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Emily barked and upon hearing her own masculine voice, she remembered what happened and tried to correct herself by stating, &quot;Er, um, well, never mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn, her face scrunched up in a look of scrutiny, didn&#39;t say anything. Emily, starting to feel uncomfortable, shifted from one foot to the other before finally exclaiming, &quot;Okay, fine. I&#39;m Emily. Your stupid, whatever, switched me and Jacob. Now he&#39;s in my body and I am in his. And it&#39;s all because of this thing that I cannot even figure out how to work,&quot; and thrusting out her hand, she showed Kaitlyn the Toroid of Transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You found it,&quot; Kaitlyn squealed and before Emily could stop her, her sister snatched it out of her hand.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, Emily grumbled, &quot;No. Jay found it. And he somehow activated the thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn, not at all paying attention, examined the piece of metal. Turning it over and over in her hand, she thought all that she could do with it, what she wanted to do with it and the properties of how it worked. Distracted when Jacob, who she was still having problems believing was Emily, snapped, &quot;So. Can you explain how it works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t I show you,&quot; Kaitlyn said and looking at the fifteen-year-old boy, she let one thought cross her mind.<br />
<br />
Again, there was no flash of light or puff of smoke or anything to herald that anything had happened. Looking at her sister, Emily was suddenly disorientated when she suddenly found herself looking at Jacob. Suddenly realising what had happened, she was caught off guard when Jacob stated, &quot;Wow. Did not expect it to happen that fast,&quot; and before Emily could stop him, he snatched the piece of metal back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Emily squeaked out in Kaitlyn voice. &quot;I didn&#39;t say for you to switch with me. Change back. I don&#39;t want to be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlyn, now in Jacob&#39;s body, flexed his fingers and shifted in place. Finding the boy&#39;s frame to bigger and slightly more difficult to move, she considered that it would be once she got used to it. Ignoring her sister, who she had always found to be a bit of stuck up air-heard obsessed with clothes and boys and her body and other trivial matters, she stuffed the Toroid into her pocket. Wanting to further explore with the thing, and figuring she got the better deal by becoming Jacob, which she decided meant she didn&#39;t have to deal with being teased at school for her breast size, have to deal with fluids leaking out of parts of her body she couldn&#39;t see, listen to her mom complain about how many problems she caused and didn&#39;t have to deal with all the other problems she faced, she looked her former self and said, &quot;Later,&quot; before turning and heading in the direction of Jacob&#39;s house, her mind on all the things she was going to try out.<br />
<br />
Outraged, unable to believe what had just happened, Emily stopped her foot and screamed, &quot;Get back here. Get back here and change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Emily&#39;s surprise, it wasn&#39;t her sister who responded, but instead her mother, who abruptly opened a nearby window and hollered, Kaitlyn Johnson. I thought I told you to get in the house and start your homework. Young lady, you&#39;re grounded for another week. Now, get in her and do as I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her head dropping, Emily wanted to cry. Knowing her mother meant business and that if she didn&#39;t do as she was told, her mom would drag her into the house, Emily hung her head and shuffled around to the back of the house. As she let herself in through the back door, and her mother directed her to the kitchen table where she would be watched, Emily wondered what she was going to tell the real Jay when he came home later on.</p>
