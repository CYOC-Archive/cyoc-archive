<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally found herself sitting nervously on a plastic chair nervously following the officers collecting evidence regarding the attempted kidnapping. It was all of the worst things that she had endured since the incident. The registration laws weren&#39;t necessarily that bad and she figured that that was all a honest reaction to something that had been long hidden. The real problem was the hatred and actions that those who hated werewolves were willing to do. The coworkers she&#39;d had at the school had been willing to bully her verbally and even encouraged the confrontation that ultimately left her with a black eye as if to start a fight. At times she was more than willing to confront them, as her instincts seemed to respond to that as a sort of challenge, but she also knew such an action wouldn&#39;t help her in the slightest and that they knew it as well. It left her feeling weak with regard to the whole situation.<br />
<br />
In her wolven form, she was strong enough to go toe to toe with a mundane lion, tiger, or grizzly and stand a relatively good chance of winning, but she wasn&#39;t a mundane animal and she had to function in the human world as well. And in the human world, her wolf form&#39;s strengths counted for little. Trying to treat the situation the way her instincts saw it would only make it worse. And it was that fact that scared her and made her feel weak. The police seemed to never have a suspect in who started the confrontation that ultimately gave her a black eye, and the hatred from that confrontation made her nervous about someone trying it again. It was that that sent her to Karl and Alice, her closest friends, the closest thing she had to a pack that would protect and stand by her. Though that wasn&#39;t entirely something she could avoid having to face, as she did have work and Karl and Alice couldn&#39;t be with her all the time. And today, two Glenwood Springs lunatics came up with the clear intent of kidnapping her and possibly killing her. It made her tremble a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will be fine,&quot; came Danielle&#39;s voice from beside her.<br />
<br />
She looked up to see the other werewolf standing next to her. Danielle looked far calmer than Sally did and even had a confident smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot; Sally asked, &quot;I got assaulted and I identified all of the attackers to the police... and all they did was ask around. This is a small town and pretty much everyone knows everyone. And they did nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle sighed. She could tell that the blond woman was frightened and frustrated. Sally Yeller had largely been alone and with only two people, at least, to protect and support her as most of the rest of her life went wrong after the incident. Her attempts to deal with that issue were clear, and one didn&#39;t need a werewolf&#39;s senses to know it. The day&#39;s incident didn&#39;t make things better. The only thing that made the overall position better was the fact that unlike the burning of a group of werewolves, this attack hadn&#39;t resulted in anyone being killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Danielle said slowly, &quot;Today is probably a bit different from the past incidents you might have had. You say you were bullied and attacked...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just outside my home... neighbors, coworkers, and even some &quot;strangers&quot; surrounded me, threw taunts... and then began to push me around,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;when I tried to get away, I got punched...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And was it caught on camera?&quot; Danielle asked, and waited patiently for Sally to shake her head. Once Sally shook her head, Danielle continued, &quot;So the only thing you have is your word. If those that attacked you deny it, how do you prove they did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, the situation is different,&quot; Danielle assured her, &quot;the security cameras and the fact that your coworkers came to your help present a different picture. It isn&#39;t your word versus theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only sighed, but she did nod. She didn&#39;t like the job, but she did have to respect her present employer for actually protecting her. She gave a weak smile, hoping that things would turn right. The sound of footsteps then made Sally turn her head. She turned to see the officer who was the leading officer in the present investigation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Yeller, are you alright?&quot; Officer Ramsey asked as he approached, his tone polite and professional.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than two lunatics wanting to kill me, I&#39;m just fine,&quot; Sally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were trying to kill you,&quot; Officer Ramsey said, &quot;can you describe what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only sighed and looked up to the officer. He looked calm but still very firm as she began to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were scheduled to have a delivery today, and much of my job here is to make sure nothing is rotten,&quot; Sally explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this had you outside when the truck arrived?&quot; Officer Ramsey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;I&#39;d just finished the inspection of the delivery when a Jeep Cherokee came screaming up... and two of the DeFranks came running out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Ramsey&#39;s face didn&#39;t changed. His talk with Robert Coleman hadn&#39;t got into the details of who the attackers were, but he had overheard some of the other grocery employees commenting on it. The DeFrank family lived like modern day mountain men. They lived well outside of town, weren&#39;t the most clean-shaven of men, and were known hunting enthusiasts. Sally continued with her statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was Earl and Bubba,&quot; Sally continued, &quot;they pulled out some rifle, claimed they had silver tipped ammunition, and demanded I go with them or they&#39;d shoot me. They only retreated Mr. Coleman fired a warning shot and demanded they leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Ramsey nodded, &quot;and what reason do you think they had for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact that I&#39;m a werewolf,&quot; Sally answered, holding up an arm to show the bracelet she wore that identified her as a werewolf, &quot;just like the mob that decided to bully me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Officer Ramsey said calmly and glanced to Danielle, &quot;and you are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danielle Schvett, I am the truck driver,&quot; Danielle answered, &quot;I was talking with Ms. Yeller when they drove up in a Jeep Cherokee... they did threaten us with silver bullets and demanded that we go with them. From there, things went as Ms. Yeller described. Her employer stepped into the open, fired a warning shot and they fled in their Jeep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Officer Ramsey answered, &quot;Ms. Yeller, I trust your contact information has not changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has not,&quot; Sally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Officer Ramsey answered, &quot;we will watch the  CCTV footage and go from there. If the DeFranks did as you say, they will be in trouble, just as you know that you will be in trouble if it turns out you are lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only nodded while Officer Ramsey turned to Danielle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Schvett, in accordance with the various registration laws regarding werewolves, I will require that you remain here in Glenwood Springs with Ms. Yeller until we are certain of what happened here,&quot; Officer Ramsey spoke, &quot;we will also require your contact information for the purposes of the trial should they require your testimony for the prosecution or defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle nodded, &quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
