<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craning his longer neck to the side so his horns didn&#39;t scrape roof of the van again, James leaned towards his sister to get her attention. The entire van leaned with him. James froze as the van quickly began veering to the left of the rural Kansas road, until his father accommodated his movements and re-centered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful...&quot; he said mildly to James, without so much as a glance through the rear-view mirror. James only responded by remaining frozen in his lean. Eventually however, James decided to continue with his plan to get his sister&#39;s attention. He didn&#39;t know if he could speak yet, but a sharp poke from his new claws would easily be enough of a surprise to get her attention. Slowly, he reached out towards his sister with a sleek, black claw. Immediately, he recoiled in shock. As the van began to veer quickly to the right, James quickly craned his head towards his father in concern. With only a sigh, his father simply re-centered the van again. After a moment, he quickly whipped his head back to his sister and almost recoiled again. When he poked her, she snapped her head to face him with an unnatural speed. Now, On her face was a look that could only be described as surprised. He expected her to start screaming and prepared for the worst of it.<br />
<br />
In the intense quiet, James grimaced as his sister remained completely locked in her look of surprise; he was expecting some sort of freak-out. Her continued stillness became increasingly awkward. Eventually, James decided to end the unbearable silence and try to speak one more time. As he opened his maw to finally break the silence, her nose and mouth suddenly pushed forward. Quickly, a dragonic maw of  her own formed as the hair on her scalp rapidly pulled in. James watched in stunned silence as a pair of horns pushed out above her ears, bright and clean in their ivory color. Her ears themselves thinned out into fin-like appendages, which seemed to flutter randomly. James gasped as her head and neck shot outward towards him, over five times longer than his, bright yellow scales replacing&#8203; the stretching skin. At this point, James realized something different was happening to her than what had happened to him. Her head squished flatter, becoming even more dragon looking than his own, and her neck shifted to connect from behind her skull as opposed to below. This caused her to involuntarily look up and break eye-contact with James. Quickly, she craned her head down to continue looking directly at him head-on.<br />
<br />
At that moment, her body began to dramatically alter even more so than James had just minutes earlier. Her chest began to barrel outwards, absorbing the shape of her breasts as her body became more like a cylinder.  Unexpectedly, she unbuckled herself and began moving towards James in a hunched over pose, never breaking her intense gaze. The seat groaned as she moved around in it, seemingly unable to take her weight. Nevertheless, she eventually maneuvered herself out of it and into the middle isle despite her still expanding torso. At this point, her blouse gave in to her size and audibly tore at her back before landed on the ground around her hands. She was on her knees, and her own arm shook at her increased weight while she used the other to fold the seat down, despite her still expanding torso getting in the way. Eventually she was successful and on top of the newly folded seat. Stomach first, her feet jutted out to the back of the van, into the luggage. James sat bewildered at her entire performance along with her rapidly increasing body size.<br />
<br />
Eventually, her body stopped growing. To James, she looked a little bigger than a horse, which was completely too large for the van. Still, her body continued to shift. Her arms and legs quickly slid under her barrel-chested torso, doing in her already struggling jeans and panties, which just as audibly as her blouse rip away and pool below her. Her feet stretched as her thighs grew wider. All at once, she was a quadruped. Her hands retained their basic shape, but became more accustomed for walking as opposed to grabbing. Her feet completely changed, becoming multi-jointed, her thick thighs capable of supporting her new body and weight. Suddenly, she extended her long neck forward and pecked James on the side of his maw with her own. Understandably, James recoiled back at the sudden movement. His horns hit the glass of the car door hard with a sharp clack, reminding him that they still exist. To save the glass, he finally broke eye-contact and turned his head sideways, toward the back of the van. He caught sight of a glistening yellow tail slither out among the luggage. Its tip lightly slapped against the floor. His maw slowly begins to hang open as he followed the tail upward and eventually to his sister&#39;s new body. Not a trace of her looked similar! She was a complete dragon. Not standing like him either, but a complete four-legged serpent.<br />
<br />
&quot;James,&quot; a voice rings out into the silence, &quot;Don&#39;t move so much!&quot; James turns his head to face the voice, scraping his horns along the glass. The screech of horns on glass finally coaxes his father into taking his eyes off the road and into the back of the van. His eyes silently drifted to along the scene happening in the back, from the frozen green dragon man to the actual yellow dragon. He sighs before facing the road again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry James. I didn&#39;t realize it was Danielle.&quot; After a few seconds, he continues, &quot;Danielle? Please clean up? The van&#39;s getting repairs as soon as we return.&quot; With that, he began to idly surf the radio stations again, looking for anything not static. James sat there, flabbergasted. Next to him, the yellow dragon that was his sister made an excited noise and happily extended her neck to the floor below him. His mind was awash in confusion, wonder, and still a little afterglow from earlier. He poked his sister, and she became a dragon. Not like him either, but a fully-fledged feral dragon that took up almost the entire back of the van. He looked behind him again, careful to avoid scraping the roof. Her saw body turned inward similar to a cat to allow her body to fit. He eyes naturally drifted down her body. He frowned heavily as he couldn&#39;t help but see the area between her legs. Specifically, aher loins and their obvious arousal.<br />
<br />
James gave an audible yelp as he felt a tugging against the tip of his member. Turning as fast as his green horned head would let him, he looked down. Below him, the floor was somehow clean from all his ejaculate from earlier. In it&#39;s place was the head of a yellow dragon with blue serpentine eyes. Her forked tongue coiled  lazily around his member, trying to catch the remaining fluids dribbling from his penis. James blushed hard bared his sharp teeth as he pushed his sister&#39;s dragon head from his groin. He didn&#39;t stop until her head was back on her side of the van, which leaned accordingly. He noticed his ripped clothing was gone, and he didn&#39;t even realize that his sister&#39;s clothing vanished too. Turning his head to look back and ignoring his sister&#39;s needs, he looked for luggage. From the four he had loaded in Colorado, only two remained. He guessed he didn&#39;t wear clothes anymore. Obviously his sister didn&#39;t anymore, being a hulking lizard barely containable by an SUV.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, he shifted in his seat uncomfortably, not used to having to sit with a tail. From the returning buildings, the motel wasn&#39;t far away. He gulped, unsure what his sister would be like when she wasn&#39;t cooped up. The figures and insignia on his amulet now painted a very clear image as to what might happen. Wait-- the amulet! Maybe he could fix this! Quickly, he grabbed the amulet and lifted it over his head with some difficulty. The chain didn&#39;t accommodate his muzzle or horns, so it took some yanking and pulling. Finally however, he pulled the ruby amulet from his person.<br />
<br />
He sat expectantly for a few seconds, waiting for something to happen. He waited for his sister to become his sister again, and not some sort of lover. He waited for the scales on his body to go away. He waited for his tail to shrink back. Of course, nothing happened. He looked to his right. His dragon sister had curled her head and closed her eyes. Her nostrils flared as she exhaled. His semen lingered around her jaws. James squeezed the amulet with his claws in frustration before he eventually raised his arm to throw it when he noticed something. The motion of almost throwing the amulet shaked the vehicle again, eliciting an angry groan from James&#39;s father. James ignored him however, reading the new information in the back of the amulet. The roman numeral for one now adorned the other side of the ruby. The new information was vague, and James suddenly felt all the ire leave him for silent resignation on the situation He let the amulet fall with his hand to the arm rest. He considered what he could do once they reached the hotel. He refused to touch or even bother his parents, unsure of what else might happen in the next ten minutes.</p>
