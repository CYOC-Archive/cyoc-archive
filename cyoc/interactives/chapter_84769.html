++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The plane came in for a relatively soft landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Inside one of the Janace transport planes, which were built specifically to carry Kats waited for the plane to come to a stop. Once they did so they found that the plane was soon hooked up to one of the airport&#39;s terminals. Apparently most of the planes that were supposed to be there had carried those that were able to escape the outbreak in the US capital to wherever the outbreak wasn&#39;t going. The result of this was that the entire place seemed to be a practical ghost town. According to what they got from the plane&#39;s pilots there wasn&#39;t even a response from the air traffic control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t there be anyone to greet us?&quot; Francine wondered as they made their way down the path into the terminal.<br />
<br />
&quot;There probably will be someone, but they&#39;ll be part of whatever teams are already here,&quot; Charlie commented, &quot;with these things, those who could escape were bound to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole and Luna nodded as well. They, after all had seen things like this before in Sydney, in Rio de Janeiro, and in other places. This was the first time Francine had been directly involved in such a mission. Even after hir transformation, Francine had remained in France and in Paris, mostly to play hir role in France&#39;s government. As such, Francine was getting hir first taste of what the &quot;Kat Kops&quot; went through. They eventually came into one of the larger rooms where passengers normally waited to find a small group of men in black suits waiting. They were quick to notice them and approached Charlie, as shi was in front.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the team from Janace?&quot; the first man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am Charlie Wise, this is my mother, Nikole, my soughter Luna, and my mother-in-law Francine,&quot; Charlie introduced the group.<br />
<br />
The men&#39;s eyes widened the mention of Francine&#39;s name. They obviously recognized the Kieen of France.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re here to talk with the President?&quot; the man asked, &quot;I&#39;m afraid he leading members of the government went to Colorado... to get in contact with the Kat Kops and get their help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not here to talk to the President,&quot; Francine answered, &quot;I&#39;m here to help my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men, obviously Secret Service agents all shrugged Eventually the leading man spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ll be grateful for it,&quot; the man spoke, &quot;as there is a lot to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of Kats are we facing?&quot; Nikole asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve only been Chakats,&quot; the Secret Service told them, &quot;Seemingly lust filled and wild... it would have been one thing if the present President&#39;s predecessor was still in office. Shi would be immune to all this... but shi&#39;d served two years before Fee City, two years after Fee City, won reelection and served four years for hir second term...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And from there shi had to step down,&quot; Charlie nodded, &quot;but even if shi were here... unless she&#39;d gotten the new vaccine, shi might not be immune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully it does work,&quot; a different secret service agent commented, &quot;though we&#39;ve only had units either surrounding the city or the major government buildings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could stand to have more darts,&quot; the leading secret service agent spoke, &quot;the best we can do right now if we run out would be to dart them and restrain them until we can get more vaccines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But in dealing with lust filled Kats the vaccine is kept in darts,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;We only use syringes if the Kat has already burned through the lust phase of the virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These are tranquilizer darts though,&quot; the secret service agent answered, &quot;we dart them, they fall asleep, we restrain them before they get the wake up and try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Kats all nodded. That was a way to get around Kats and their lust if there was a shortage of any vaccine. It would certainly work better then killing them, though it was probably due to the fact that the US had greater contact with Maurice, Snowy, and Jess in Janace that they knew what types of tranquilizers would work and how much they would need to keep a Kat asleep for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got some vehicles, we&#39;ll take you to the command bunker under the White House,&quot; the secret service agent then finished.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As with many other outbreaks, national guard, police, and other military units were rapidly brought up in the effort to contain the outbreak. They at first formed a ring around the city, mostly forming whatever sort of barricades and gates that normally kept any insurrection or protest group at bay. Though, like with Fee City, it didn&#39;t look as though the Kats didn&#39;t seem to have much interest in in anything more than mating with each other or turning any human they could catch in America&#39;s capital that hadn&#39;t escaped. As they went the secret service agent explained how the outbreak began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a missile,&quot; the secret service agent explained, &quot;it came from the sea... our radar picked it up  and that&#39;s when we got the President and government leaders out of the city and called the Maryland and Virginia National Guard to respond... we initially thought it would be a nuclear weapon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it contained the gas form of the virus,&quot; Nikole surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the secret service agent nodded as he drove around a corner, &quot;Thankfully with the earlier warning, we could contain the city and since the vaccines are now rapidly becoming standard issue... the city was contained  and we could then protect the major government buildings. Those that tested the boundaries or attempted to cross into Maryland or into Virginia were vaccinated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there are many that are mindlessly mating, I take it?&quot; Francine asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;And may try to mate with you, but you all were vaccinated?&quot; the secret service asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only that...&quot; Charlie gave a confident smirk and brandished hir tail, &quot;I AM the vaccine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Modesty, Charlie, modesty,&quot; Nikole chided hir soughter, &quot;but Charlie is right. The new vaccine is hir &quot;venom&quot; which means that Charlie can&#39;t run out completely... though shi can run dry for a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long would it take to refill?&quot; the secret service agent questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a few hours,&quot; Charlie admitted, &quot;but this will really be the first real field test and I&#39;ll still be using a dart gun as much as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is you plan?&quot; the secret service agent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much of the vaccine do you presently have?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not enough for everyone in the city, but we do have enough tranquilizers,&quot; the secret service agent answered, &quot;so if need be we can secure everyone if they come into the open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie traded glances to the others. He looked closest to Luna, who had once seen hir own parents killed in the Paris outbreak when the French army and police fired on them in fear. Luna had grown up under Charlie and Sally&#39;s care, and they took great pride in Luna&#39;s marriage with Lia, even if Lia was Luna&#39;s biological cousin, as well as in Luna becoming mother with Lia. Their love was strong and no one could deny that, and that gave Charlie a great deal of pride in Luna, and as a parent that pride also made Charlie concerned for the feelings and thoughts of one she loved and raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as we don&#39;t have to kill anyone,&quot; Luna spoke and held hir father&#39;s hand, &quot;that should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The secret service agent nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll then move from the north and move toward the Potomac river,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;Your men can then follow behind us and any Kat that isn&#39;t vaccinated will be caught if they try to flee across the river.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if they attack you? Try to rape you?&quot; the secret service agent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie and Francine are already pregnant,&quot; Luna spoke, &quot;and neither Nikole or I are in heat... so at worst... they get vaccinated in a different way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One we try to avoid, but shi is right,&quot; Nikole added when shi saw the secret service agent asked.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
They were driven and posted at different points along the northern end of Washington DC. Teams of soldiers, policemen, and even a few FBI and secret service agents were eager to get the support of the UN groups that even before the outbreaks in Sydney, Cairo, and Hong Kong many years before were known as the Kat Kops. To Francine this was somewhat of a surprise and rather new. These teams though were fairly professional agreed to follow the plan to pin the non-vaccinated Kats against the Potomac River. That was more than good enough for Francine. Shi gripped the dart gun given to hir and began to make hir way into into the city.<br />
<br />
The scenes shi walked into startled hir in many ways. The cries of lust filled Kats mating with one thing that echoed through the air. They were cries of pleasure, and Francine knew shi had given many similar cries whenever shi mounted Justin or whenever Justin mounted hir. The slight rounding of hir womb was even proof of that. But the cries that echoed through air were strangle to hir. It was odd to hir, but it did feel strange. The cries shi gave shi when mated with Justin were commonly joined with hir declaring that shi loved Justin and Justin declaring hir love for Francine. Here, the cries were nothing but lust and there was no love there. And as hir patrols, either through the streets or through the buildings, the sights reinforced that. Total strangers mounting one another and their sexual fluids making a mess of either the lawns or the halls of these buildings.<br />
<br />
However, dealing with them was easy enough. One quick dart and the mating Kats soon came back to their senses. That then lead to what was the biggest single problem that Francine found while being in America, especially when they figured who shi was.<br />
<br />
&quot;EEEEEEEEEKKKK!&quot; came the cry from one who was wearing a necklace and then came running.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy!&quot; hir partner came running as as Francine found the Kat shi&#39;d darted hugged hir and began to bounce up and down.<br />
<br />
Francine nervously lifted hir head back as the Kat naked fur covered breasts bounced against Francine&#39;s vest. This Amy seemed to be the sort that took a great &quot;fandom&quot; of those that were considered celebrities. Francine didn&#39;t think that fandom included foreign royalty, but it appeared that shi was wrong. Shi did wonder how this Kat recognized hir though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can  you believe it?!&quot; Amy called to hir partner, &quot;This is one of the Kieens of France! Here right in front of us! I&#39;m hugging royalty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; hir friend and apparent mate asked, &quot;Our upstairs neighbors are bot Serval based Chakats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they have such pretty flowers on their vests? Are they pregnant?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
The other Kat admitted some defeat at that and only shrugged. Amy continued to hug Francine and bounce up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got raped and changed and the first thing you think of once you get your mind back is to hug some country&#39;s ruler like some giddy fan-girl?&quot; hir mate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you wouldn&#39;t jump up and down if this was one of the Redskins,&quot; Amy shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;They play football,&quot; Amy&#39;s mate argued, &quot;Not sit on velvet cushions all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, Amy was distracted by hir argument, and the distraction allowed Francine to bring hir arms up and pull hirself out of Amy&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not wish to be involved in your argument, but I have work that I must do to stop all of this from spreading,&quot;  Francine told them and too a few steps back, &quot;the national guard gave me a few extra dart guns and a few clips of the vaccine darts with the new vaccine with  them. If you want to help, I would appreciate it... if not... I need you to return to your home and apartment and not cause any trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Amy asked, resuming hir bouncing up and down, even if not being able to hug Francine, &quot;Ralph and I would love to help royalty? What do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine turned on hir waist and pulled two dart guns from bags that hung over hir taur back and then handed them to the two new Kats, Amy and Ralph. After that shi handed them several clips of darts with the Wise Vaccine in them. The dart guns came from the National Guard, but the darts themselves came from the team when they had come to Janace. Each team, when they left Janace had as much of the Wise Vaccine as they could carry with them. It might handle the cities, but a lot of it would be dependent on the outbreaks being contained. So far though, things were going well. And even if they ran out of vaccine in the dart guns, they did have Charlie and shi could vaccinate them naturally.<br />
<br />
The path through Washington largely followed the same path as hir run in with Ralph and Amy did. Not everyone that was transformed decided to help, but those that did were enthusiastic, and talks with the National Guard gave the indication that Luna, Nikole, and Charlie were getting the same sort of help. One apparently made an overly lust driven comment at Luna when two Kats that Luna had vaccinated jumped the Kat and held it down. By the time that they began to reach the Potomac river on Washington DC&#39;s south edge, they actually had gathered an army of volunteers, and made the final securing of the city to be relatively easy, with casualties being at a minimum and only injuries, resulting from when the outbreak started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that went easy,&quot; Nikole commented with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Controlling the outbreak was,&quot; Charlie commented, &quot;but we may need to talk with any military personnel on what they saw in terms of the cause of the outbreak...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The secret service guy said it was a missile,&quot; Luna commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but launched by whom? From where?&quot; Charlie asked back, &quot;it may be one of the few clues we have at putting an end to all these outbreaks and allowing us to live in peace...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The military won&#39;t share secrets with regard to things it will consider an act of war,&quot; Nikole spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not talking about stopping them,&quot; Charlie sighed, &quot;I&#39;m talking about making sure that whatever comes doesn&#39;t allow for more trouble to come after this... Jess... Sally, you... me... Maurice... Snowy... we thought it would end when we moved to Janace and started the ranch... but Ronnie in his attempt to &quot;save&quot; Maurice unwittingly helped Li Sang start all the outbreaks leading up to Houston and New Orleans. We thought Li Sang&#39;s capture would be the end of it, and then came the outbreaks in Russia. The one in Moscow that Danna, Mikkie, Angel, and Demon vaccinated with their own natural equipment and then in St. Petersberg that went off as a back up or in a way similar to the initial start of the Moscow outbreak. We thought it was over when Li Sang&#39;s lieutenants got their names revealed and the &quot;heat&quot; put on them... yet after six years they hit the Vatican with a strain that has forced us to retool everything and now this, which is bigger than ANY of the previous outbreaks and has to be for a purpose bigger than cover for bank robberies and far more sinister then ending war and disease. We need to know if all the big wigs are going to be in the country that launched this attack... so that we can help end the threat of these outbreaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie then looked to hir mother and pulled Nikole into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want the world to be safe for my soughters,&quot; Charlie spoke, &quot;Where Sally and I can have our soughters and raise them in peace and where Janice, Pinkie, Fluffy, Mary, Reca, Diamond and every Kat we&#39;ve rescued isn&#39;t faced with this sort of thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole only hugged Charlie back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dear,&quot; Nikole purred, &quot;You&#39;re just being  a good mother... concerned for the welfare of hir babies. And believe me, I know.&quot;</p>
