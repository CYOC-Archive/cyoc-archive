<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate walked into the locker room, feeling won out. Wrestling practice had been brutal and he was really feeling it.  He was especially feeling the hard throbbing of his dick beneath the silver spandex of the singlet he was wearing. Nate was gay but he didn’t want anybody on the team to know but last night his roommate and fellow team member had walked in on him getting a blowjob from one of the guys in their dorm.  His roommate Seth hadn’t said anything about it since then but today in practice Seth took every opportunity he had to grab Nate though the singlet and work his cock into an erection.<br />
 <br />
Every guy on the team had gotten a boner at some point during practice before but this was different.  Seth kept playing with him, grabbing his package, or thrusting against him every time he pinned him to the mat. In fact Nate had the distinct impression that Seth was trying to make him cum. Eventually he couldn’t take it anymore and left the practice room early.<br />
 <br />
Now as he sat in front of his locker his throbbing manhood was demanding attention and there was an unmistakable musk that hung in the air that made his need feel that much stronger. The smell was more potent in front of his locker and when he opened it up he was greeted by a waterfall of sticky white come splashing all down the front of his singlet and several large and very realistic looking dildos.<br />
  <br />
At first he thought that Seth had played a prank on him but he couldn’t figure out how he would have managed to fill his locker so full of cum. His cock was demanding attention, now more than ever and he pealed the spunk covered singlet down off his chiseled body.  He grabbed his manhood and started working the shaft, his grip easily lubed by some of the seed that was still covering his skin.<br />
 <br />
He continued to jerk himself off when a thought struck him. He picked up one of the dildos and found it to be soft and warm, again feeling very much like a real cock. He started to rub the cock against his ass as he masturbated when suddenly he found it stuck there. He tried pulling it away from his skin but found that it was impossibly attached to his body just above his crack. In fact it looked like he had a cock for a tail. Unbelievably the cock started to stiffen and Nate felt himself moan aloud as he could feel his blood bounding into the new prick until it stood out stiffly from his rear.  He stroked his front and rear cock and felt his pleasure double.<br />
 <br />
He couldn’t stop himself as he reached down and picked up another phallus off the floor and started to rub it over his chest. Without warning  this cock suckered on to his left nipple and quickly attached itself. Nate nearly fainted as his new cock nipple hardened until it stood proudly out on his chest. He had to have more! He selected another cock and pressed it against his right nipple and it behaved just like the first one attaching to his body and rapidly surging to full mast.<br />
 <br />
Nate’s entire body felt like it was on fire and he took turns rubbing each of his cocks one and two at a time. His chest heaved as his massive pecs  supported the large heavy pricks hanging from them, and he found if he shook his ass from side to side his hard tail boner would slap against his firm round buttocks.<br />
 <br />
Eventually he selected one of the three remaining cocks and lifted it to his lips. He licked along the length of the cock, slurping off some of the thick salty cum tat still clung to it. He could feel it pulse in response as he ran his tongue over the attached set of balls when they immediately stuck there. He gasped in pleasure as he sucked the balls into his mouth and the massive swelling cock soon replaced his tongue all together.<br />
 <br />
The stimulation was too much and was starting to overload the rest of his body. All of his cocks were leaking enormous amounts of slippery clear pre, creating small waterfalls that ran down across his abs, ass and chin.  He furiously beat at as many of the cocks as possible and he was just about to cum when he heard the locker room door swing open.</p>
