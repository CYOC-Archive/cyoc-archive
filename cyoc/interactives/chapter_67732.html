<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking the next block and a half home, glad that her cousin has taken off ahead of her, Brenda was left to her thoughts, which kept going back to the costume jewelry that Brian had found and insisted that it was more than just some piece of junk. A twinging sensation in her abdomen caused her to absently rub at her stomach as her thoughts shifted to her monthly.<br />
<br />
As she wondered if was possible for her to get her period at least a week to a week and a half earlier than what she had come to expect, Brenda walked up the front walk of the house shared by her mom, her aunt Carter and Uncle Joseph. Stepping through the door, the bloated feeling in her abdomen shifting lower, she slammed the door and dropped her book bag in frustration at what she thought of as Brian's stupidity and the way she was suddenly feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't slam the door,&quot; her aunt Carter called out as she passed by, stopped and then added, &quot;Brian will you please empty the trash bins?&quot; as she looked directly at Brenda.<br />
<br />
Confused, Brenda blinked a moment as her aunt disappeared and after a moment, she called out, &quot;But. Why do I have to do it?&quot; and starting to follow her aunt, she stopped after a couple feet as her uncle's voice called out from the living room, &quot;Brian. Stop arguing with your mother and do as she told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what was going, thinking that there was some great big hoax being played at her expense, Brenda huffed in frustration as the bloated feeling settled into her groin area.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, Brenda kicked off her shoes and hung up her jacket, her thoughts on taking a shower and slipping into her favourite pair of sweats and shirt occupying her mind as she headed up the stairs and to her room. Noticing that the light to her room was on, she paused for a moment and running a hand across her abdomen and groin, she decided that she would also take something for the discomfort, just as soon as she figured out why her bedroom light was on.<br />
<br />
Pushing open the door, she gazed around the room and then stopped when she saw Brian sitting in front of her vanity, a dazed look upon his face. But it wasn't so much the look on his face, but the fact that he was wearing her favourite pair of pink pants and her purple shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you...&quot; Brenda began, but then immediately stopped as a bout of cramps nearly caused her to double up in pain.<br />
<br />
Peering over at his cousin, the look of confusion deepening, Brian shrugged and commented, &quot;I don't know. I came home a couple seconds before you and without thinking about, came up here and changed into what I thought was something to relax in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another bout of cramps washed through Brenda's groin and abdomen and then she felt something push first against her underwear, than push past her underwear as what felt like something exited her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand it,&quot; Brian continued. &quot;Suddenly I want to wear these pink, cotton pants. Like to wear them. And I think this purple shirt goes well and shows off just the right amount of cleavage. Which is strange in and of itself as I don't have cleavage, but for some reason I know that I wear a C cup size bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring her cousin's rambling, Brenda turned about and hurried out of the room and towards the bathroom, aware that for some reason her stance and the way she walked had for some reason changed. Closing the door, she pulled up on the skirt she was wearing and gazed down, a sense of dread welling up in her as she took in the oddity that was now thrusting its way past her underwear and down a couple inches her leg.<br />
<br />
Gingerly she touched it, all too aware what a penis looked like and then drew back her hand at how sensitive it felt, especially around the head. Reaching up, she grasped the hem of her underwear and pulled down as the thought about how perverted she was for wearing girl's underwear came to mind.<br />
<br />
As she gazed at what was clearly a penis and set of testicles that now took up the area that only moments ago was smooth and flat, Brenda asked herself, &quot;How is this possible,&quot; as she let go of her dress and then began to fidget with it as it could be clearly seen that she had a set of male reproduction and genitalia that poked just past the edge of her skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is intolerable,&quot; Brenda thought as she quit fidgeting and decided that what she needed was something better than a skirt, &quot;Which only a pervert would wear,&quot; she figured, and exiting the bathroom, she headed back down the hallway.<br />
<br />
But instead of heading toward her room, she instead walked into Brian's room, comfortable with everything around her as she headed for the dresser and took out a pair of boxer briefs, a pair of sweat pants and a t-shirt. Dressing, comfortable with what she was wearing, Brenda suddenly remembered her cousin and then, realising where she was and what she was wearing, she stopped for a moment, picked up the clothes she had just been wearing and headed out of what she was starting to think of as her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got a problem,&quot; Brian announced as way of greeting Brenda as she entered the room and dumped the clothes she was carrying onto the bed.<br />
<br />
Glancing at her cousin, she asked, &quot;You've got a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Brian and standing, without further explanation, he pulled down the pants he was wearing, exposing himself from the waist down as he said, &quot;I cannot find my penis and testicles. But at the same time, I know that I have a vulva and my reproductive organs are up inside my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling uncomfortable, mostly at the fact that her cousin was exposing himself, &quot;Or would it be herself?&quot; Brenda wondered, (s)he turned away, telling Brian, &quot;Ugh. Pull up your pants,&quot; in the process.<br />
<br />
Complying, Brian sat back down and after a moment asked, &quot;Why is this happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Brenda replied. &quot;But we have to find out why and reverse it. I, for one, do not really like the idea of become a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian, looking down, made no response and standing Brenda began to walk back in forth, trying to sort out the what and why of what was happening. &quot;This has to be some sort of spell,&quot; she finally announced, to which Brian made a whimpering noise and when Brenda told him to focus, he whispered, &quot;My chest feels weird,&quot; as he stood and moved toward the bed.<br />
<br />
Watching Brian climb into the bed, Brenda wanted to do something to snap her cousin out of whatever had suddenly come over him. Unable to think of anything, (s)he finally said, &quot;I'll be in my room,&quot; and turning about, she marched out of what had once been her room and into the room that had once belonged to her cousin, positive that it was her room and had always been her room. Booting up the computer in the corner, she silently cursed her cousin and his unhelpful attitude and deciding to deal with him at a later point, she began her search for ways a girl could turn into a man and vice versa.</p>
