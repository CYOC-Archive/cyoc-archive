<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie had immediately flown out with Jason but Derrick wasn&#39;t ready to stand up yet. The magical elixir was still doing its thing and leaving him occasionally orgasming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm guys, I can think of three problems off the top of my head.&quot; Derrick said as blood rushed to his face and then back down to his 9 inch penis. <br />
<br />
All the gods looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to find my dad who looks, acts, and talks, nothing like I remember. He&#39;s in a place, I don&quot;t know how to fi-Ohhh goddd.&quot; Derrick orgasmed again. Des smirked. &quot;Find!&quot; Derrick finished forcefully. &quot;And even if I do find it, they will throw me out as soon as I step inside, I&#39;m not old enough to be in a bar.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I do find the right bar, get in, find him, realize its him, how do I get him to come with me?&quot; Derrick asked, looking at his empty glass beginning to feel hopeless. &quot;He doesn&#39;t even remember that I exist, so he wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told him the truth, let alone be interested in coming back to be a dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
What Derrick didn&#39;t notice was the vibrant exchange of glances and gestures between the gods as they already solved his problems shortly after he finished listing the obstacles.<br />
<br />
Derrick looked up as Ganymede set two drinks and a shot in front of him and he looked to the others confused. <br />
<br />
The Erotes crowded around him to explain, &quot;We can&#39;t go into a bar, well, a populated bar, but only when we don&#39;t want someone to hook up... like now.&quot; Des rambled, Amor cut in. &quot;We can get you to the bar, Des&#39; familiar with all bars, I rarely frequent them. But you will have to go in without us, Ganymede can help you with that and describe your father&#39;s current form to you.&quot; Amor gestured to the beverages. Logan interjected, &quot;You will need to seduce your father and bring him back so the curses can be undone, for this I will give you my blessing,&quot; Logan picked up the shot and spat in it. &quot;Whatever you say once you drink that will be extremely well received by any mortal. Be careful.&quot; Logan looked quite solemn setting the drink back down.<br />
<br />
Derrick was taken aback but he had a real chance to fix his family, so he took it. He grabbed one of the large drinks and took a swig, nearly gagging. It wasn&#39;t nearly as good as the Panacea. &quot;Oh God, that&#39;s awful.&quot; He grimaced and saw he had two mugs to go through.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll put hair on your chest!&quot;, Des remarked jokingly. &quot;It&#39;ll get easier as you go. You need to overwhelm the negation effects of the Panacea before it will take effect, then you need enough to get you into the bar. So drink up&quot; Des continued. <br />
<br />
Amor took over as Derrick took three large gulps, &quot;The shot is to ensure you are completely straight. Once you are an adult you will be susceptible to our powers as you have been in our presence more than most mortals. Even though you will immediately leave, love will be looking for you, we don&#39;t want you to be the one undoing of your parents&#39; marriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick was now half way done with the first drink and took another two gulps, there weren&#39;t side any effects yet. &quot;Hey just a thought guys. If I&#39;m going to be growing, I need different clothes to go out. I can run to my hotel room and borrow some of my dad&#39;s clothes. Ill be back in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s right, His dad&#39;s a twink so he&#39;s going to be a confident bodybuilder type of guy by the time the drink is done with him. Though his body and personality will change drastically to be the perfect man for his father, he will remember who he was, and that shot will keep him straight.&quot; Ganymede said sounding sad.<br />
<br />
With that he bolted up to the room and raided his dad&#39;s suitcase grabbing shorts, shoes, a belt and an XL t-shirt. He honestly couldn&#39;t imagine filling out these clothes within the next decade, let alone in the next few minutes, but trusted his new friends that he was changing. He couldn&#39;t help himself, he went to the bathroom mirror and examined himself closely, no changes. He changed from his size 28 shorts to his dads size 38 shorts and cinched the belt as tight as it would go. His cock and balls were still a well endowed, adult sized, though not as grotesquely huge, and come to think of it, Derrick hadn&#39;t uncontrollably orgasmed or felt them shrink in the last 5 minutes. It must be working.<br />
<br />
Derrick hobbled slowly back downstairs to the bar holding his shorts up the entire way and looking pathetically comical in the extremely oversized shirt. He nearly tripped several times in the adult shoes and got a weird look or two from other guests, the hotel staff however seemed completely unsurprised. &quot;Alright guys, I think its about to start working, its been about 10 minutes and I haven&#39;t felt my junk shrink anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick sat down and dutifully began chugging the drink, after unhitching his belt. Finishing the first brew, he let out a belch and asked, &quot;is It worKINg&quot; in a cracking voice.<br />
<br />
All the gods gave their affirming nods and &quot;yeps.&quot; They were watching intently as the mortal before them changed. Most gods have shape changing abilities, but for most they have to will themselves to change, or it happens instinctively. Watching mortals involuntarily change throughout their whole lives is fascinating, but slow. This is immensely engrossing to them, every time. <br />
<br />
Derrick picked up the next drink and took a few gulps. &quot;Ooh, You&#39;re right, This does taste better now.&quot; Derrick said in a rich baritone voice, repositioning  in his chair.<br />
<br />
He now looked to be around 18. Sitting on the bar stool he had grown enough to rest his feet on the ground instead of the footrest. A dark stubble crept down his sidburns and across the bottom of his jaw working its way up. There were a few patches where hair didn&#39;t come in yet but that was filling in as the changes continued and he aged. A few times he shook his head as the mental changes intruded.<br />
<br />
Derrick himself paused to appreciate the changes, as he had to reposition again. Hair now covered his body, his legs kept getting more and more muscular. He grabbed his arms and felt his pecs as they ballooned with muscle. &quot;God, I feel small, when was the last time I hit the gym?&quot; he mumbled to himself getting momentarily swept up in the mental changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boys, you look like you enjoy my body as much as I do. Shall I take you for a spin?&quot; Derrick asked the staring gods leaning back to show off his endowment as he entered his early 20&#39;s, his brash attitude matching his high testosterone bodybuilding physique.<br />
<br />
The Erotes glared daggers at Ganymede. &quot;Hey, you know how my drinks work, he needs to finish the transformation, until then, he&#39;s in the throws of it.&quot; Ganymede said defensively. &quot;And he will be gay until he drinks the shot you blessed. You remember what happened last time a mortal had a drink I &#39;just whipped up&#39;, it took weeks to fix.&quot; he said staring at Logan. &quot;Once the transformation completes he will remember his real life and the fake one, the shot will help him with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick took a few more swigs and Ganymede took the last quarter of the drink away, he had completed a full drink from when he said the Panacea had been nullified.<br />
<br />
As Derrick entered his mid twenties he became much more subdued, to the love gods he suddenly reeked of heartbreak and loss. Des instinctively moved to grab him, sensing he was in desperate need of a rebound or even a pity fuck. Amor, luckily grabbed Des before he made contact, which made Des realize what he was about to do.<br />
<br />
Derrick stared solemnly at the shot before him, in his mind he had just gotten out of a bad relationship where the man he loved hated his own body and was envious of Derricks. He would be petty and throw cutting words but Derrick loved him and was more than willing to help him. He wasn&#39;t ready. He didn&#39;t want to be Derrick&#39;s twink any more but worse yet, he acted as though Derrick was emotionally abusive throughout the relationship which he wasn&#39;t. His ex only knew how to be a victim and Derrick empowering and encouraging him took him too far out of his comfort zone. The whole thing was sad and Derrick should feel angry but he just felt heartbroken. He saw where they could have gotten but his ex pulled the plug on everything they had built. The potion just primed him to be able to stare across the bar and find his next perfect gay lover, who is currently at another bar.<br />
<br />
With an empty sigh, Derrick, now barely clinging to his mid 20&#39;s, took down the shot before him. recalling he had already had a couple of drinks and now a shot he stood up to leave and the world spinned. He sat back down, not before his shorts fell, and the other patrons of the bar rushed to ask if he was okay.<br />
<br />
They seemed familiar but the thought was far away. It felt like his brain flushed the toilet and the fog on his mind was swept away suddenly. He was a 26 year old gay man who just went through a terrible break up and a 15 year old kid looking for his father. Looking at the men around him he thought he would find them attractive, especially Ganymede, but he didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Derrick collected his shorts and realized he was approximately a 34 waist and the belt was very much a necessity. The shoes now fit and he was very familiar with the gay hot spots around town, but couldn&#39;t recall any of the barkeepers names. He knew he would find his father to be very interesting to his new personality, and will just have to lead him on, long enough to get him here. With Logan&#39;s blessing, anyone who hears his voice will be under his spell.</p>
