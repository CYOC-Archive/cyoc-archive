<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On a beautiful summer day, Brandon was outside his home. The bored ten-year-old passed the time with one of his favorite activities: killing bugs. He watched with amusement as he drowned a mound of ants in his driveway with a water hose. The tiny black creatures were running around frantically, trying to flee the immense currents from which they were powerless to escape.<br />
<br />
While Brandon was enjoying himself, he suddenly felt nauseous as the world started spinning around him. He fell to his knees, his heartbeat increasing as his body began to shrink. His limbs gradually morphed, bending at awkward angles all over his body, with his fingers long gone. Two additional arms now protruded from the sides of his body.<br />
<br />
When the dizziness passed, he came through and realized he was on a blacktop. Tens, if not hundreds, of other people were scurrying around him. He was shocked to see that not only were they all naked, but they were crawling around with extra arms. They were like ants with ant-like legs but with human skin and mostly humanoid heads. Looking at his own body, he realized he was just like them. <br />
<br />
After inspecting his new appendages and trying to make sense of it all, he called out for help to the other people scurrying past him. Though he couldn&#39;t utter a single noise despite how much he tried. A thunderous earthquake, far greater than anything he had ever felt, interrupted him from his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Brandon turned around to see two enormous dark yellow pillars that extended far into the sky. He craned his neck to see the columns merge into a pink object. As he did so, he noticed something even more terrifying. Far above him was a giant cricket head, hundreds of times his size. Its large, black, compound eyes looked down at him, its massive antennae twitching slightly.<br />
<br />
It finally clicked when Brandon realized that the two enormous pillars were the cricket&#39;s legs. The pink object above it was the cricket&#39;s shorts, and the objects at the base of them must have been its shoes, flip-flops from the looks of it. The cricket was not only taller than him, it was human-like, with only two arms. As Brandon trembled with fear, too frightened to even think, the cricket moved its mouth.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ooh guys there&#39;s some over here.&quot; the monstrous cricket spoke in a feminine voice, booming loudly to the minuscule Brandon. The earthquakes intensified as Brandon looked around and saw four more giant, dark pillars approaching. He tilted his head up to see the huge head of an ant and one of a fly. The ant wore a pink shirt, black shorts, and red flip-flops, while the fly wore a white shirt, black shorts, and black sandals. The monstrous bipedal insects turned their heads downward as they surrounded him. The fly appeared to be holding a phone in one of its hands. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; the fly spoke, also in a feminine voice. &quot;Today I&#39;m with Cassy and Amy, and we&#39;ll be doing the human challenge!&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;Human challenge?&quot; Brandon thought as he tried to process those words. The fly pointed the phone at him as if to record something.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So as you can see, there&#39;s a large human hill in my driveway and-&quot; The fly uttered before a loud bang came crashing down near Brandon, knocking him off his feet. Suddenly, a swarm of people were running around faster than before. <br />
<br />
As Brandon regained his composure, he realized that the ant&#39;s enormous foot had landed mere inches from him. After it came back up off the ground, Brandon nearly collapsed and vomited at the morbid sight. On the sole of the foam flip-flop were the crushed and mangled remains of several people, their lives gone in an instant. Brandon didn&#39;t have enough time to process the gravity of the situation as more loud booms went off. <br />
<br />
All around him, the ant&#39;s enormous feet kept crashing down as it stomped around. In the distance, he briefly caught a glimpse of the massive cricket hunched over, smashing the ground with its flip-flop. It was clear to Brandon that his life was in danger, and he had to make a run for it. All the while, giggles and laughter emanated from the massive insects above. <br />
 <br />
Brandon continued to run for his life, dodging as many attacks as he could, but couldn&#39;t escape the sphere of the ant. There wasn&#39;t an opening to break free, as the ant crushed in random directions. Trying to keep up as best he could, Brandon unexpectedly didn&#39;t see her foot come crashing down on him, pressing him briefly against the ground before lifting off of him. <br />
<br />
He lay on the ground in great pain, unable to move, his vision blurred. He could only hear the laughter and giggles from above and wondered how heartless they could be. As he reflected on his life during his last few minutes, he regretted torturing all those insects. But he learned his lesson far too late. Eventually, his vision faded, but he still lived through immense pain. After a few minutes, though it felt like an eternity, he heard voices.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Alright, thanks for watching. Recommend other challenges in the comments!&quot; a voice boomed above. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Gross! Look at my flip flops!&quot; another said, followed by joint laughter. The voices faded as Brandon lay alone in pain, with the ambient sounds of the outside world in the background. Eventually, his hearing faded as well, and he waited for death to come, which came hours later. <br />
 <br />
The fly would later upload the video to YouTube, where hundreds of other insects would be amused by watching the slaughter. But, in the insect world, nothing of importance was lost.</p>
