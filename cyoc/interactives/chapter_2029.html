<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby felt hungry, and since he happened to be near the mall, decided to drop by the food court for a bite. 
<br />
    He didn't need much, and decided to go by Hot Dogs N More, and grab a couple of corn dogs. He'd always felt that the girls that worked there looked pretty silly in their multi colored outfits and tall hats. Looking at the 23 year old college student behind the counter who was in the process of taking his order, he just couldn't help thinking that the outfit would look better on a six year old. 
<br />
    As Stephanie took his order and began to fill it, she noticed that her clothes felt a little larger than usual.
<br />
    &quot;That's strange,&quot;she thought to herself as she tucked a few of her light brown curls back under her hat,&quot; these clothes fit just fine earlier. Well, it has been quite a long shift. It's nice being eighteen and able to hold down a job outside of school though.&quot;
<br />
     She finished up Bobby's order, and handed it to him.&quot;Here you go dude,&quot; she said smiling at him.&quot;Like, did you want a lemonade with that?&quot;the fifteen year old asked. 
<br />
     &quot;Oh shit,&quot;he thought to himself,&quot;this thing really does work!&quot;
<br />
     &quot;Yeah, you can get me a large lemonade to go with it.&quot;
<br />
     He watched her get even younger as she completed his order, and couldn't help thinking that the other two girls working with her also seemed like children of the same age in those silly uniforms. 
<br />
     &quot;Here you go sir,&quot; came the voice of the now flat chested 11 year old girl, just able to reach the counter.&quot;You want anything else, or you okay? I's just helpin out my older sisters for awhile, you know?&quot;
<br />
     &quot;Sure thing, I think that's really great of you. No, I'll be fine, thanks.&quot;
<br />
     &quot;Okay mister, have a real good day,&quot; the nine year old said as he headed over to a table to enjoy the food. 
<br />
     &quot;Hey, like Stephanie, who was that totally hot guy,&quot;asked a now 16 year old fellow worker named Deena. 
<br />
     &quot;Ooooh, that was just some silly boy,&quot;replied the eight year old. &quot;I wish these clothes fit better too.&quot;
<br />
     &quot;Us, too,&quot;replied the other two girls, who were also looking slightly confused about their increasingly baggy clothing. 
<br />
      Bobby blissfully ate his lunch, forgetting Merlin's warning about having ten minutes to share the extra years with others.
<br />
      Finishing up his lunch about ten minutes later, he headed down the mall to the bookstore.
<br />
      On the way, he passed by the Victoria's Secret, where he checked out an outfit or two he might like to see his girlfriend in. 
<br />
       A woman of about five foot nine,well proportioned with he'd say a well endowed C cup, happened to be checking out bras close by. 
<br />
        Unfortunately for her,the 10 minutes ran out about this time. 
<br />
        &quot;Looking for something for a special someone?&quot; the woman asked him.
<br />
      &quot;Hmmm?&quot;he replied,as he looked up to see a lady with jet black tight curly long hair down to her waist, with an orange halter top and a black leather mini skirt.&quot;Oh, sorry about that. I thought that I'd step in for a second and check out the place, see if there were something my girlfriend might like.&quot;
<br />
       &quot;Oh, what a sweetey,&quot;she replied,&quot; she's a lucky girl. By the way, my name's Monique.&quot;
<br />
        About this time,Bobby noticed the first hints of grey around her temples, as well as a few assorted grey curls.
<br />
        &quot;Ahh, I just remebered, I have to meet a friend at the bookstore,&quot;he stammered as he attempted to get out of the store as fast as possible.
<br />
         &quot;My name's Bobby, and I don't mean to be rude but I really did promise them...&quot;
<br />
         &quot;Oh, that's fine dear,&quot; said the woman as she passed  
<br />
fifty five, and her face started to show some wrinkles,and more and more grey hairs showed, giving it a salt and pepper look.&quot;Such     
<br />
good manners in a boy your age.
<br />
           Dear, if you have some free time this evening, I'm having my thirtieth birthday at the TGI Fridays, and I'd love to see you there. &quot;
<br />
          &quot;Believe me, it's a lot more than 30,&quot;he mumbled, as               she passed 70, starting to appear a bit weathered.
<br />
          &quot;What was that dear, you need to speak up.&quot;
<br />
          &quot;I said that there is nothing to worry about, I don't see why not.&quot;
<br />
          &quot;Honey, can you help me over to that bench outside, I really need to take these pumps off for a few seconds.Maybe I'll stop by the shoe store and pick up something a bit more comfortable.
<br />
          Bobby helped her over to the bench, thanked her for the invite, and quickly headed to the bookstore. Before he left though, he made sure that her mental adjustment was such that she didn't freak out upon seeing an eighty one year old woman in the mirror. However, he made it so that she still dressed the same, and that she felt she was still quite the hipster.
<br />
          As he looked back, a grey and white haired woman winked  at him and blew him a kiss. 
<br />
           Remembering his sister's upcoming birthday, he went next into the Hallmark store. 
<br />
           As he perused the various cards, he noticed that there were a couple of girls who he went to school with.
<br />
           &quot;Hey Bobby, what's the haps?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Oh, just hanging out. I'm actually on my way to the bookstore,and then I happened to recall my sis' B'day, so I dropped in here to pick up a card.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Yeah,&quot;Jeanine,the short and petite girl, with shoulder length frizzy blonde hair told him,&quot;Stacey and I are here to pick up a card for her sister's 21st birthday. It'd be great if we could actually go out to the bars with them, but were just 19.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Tell you what, are you really serious about wanting to go?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Duh, of course we are,&quot;answered Stacey, as she flipped back her long ,straight, red hair,&quot;why, what'd you have in mind?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Would you like to be older?&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Yeah right,go ahead and make me 55 and Jeanine 65,if you can.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Stacey, are you nuts?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;C'mon Jeanine, do you think he can actually pull it off? Think of it this way, if he really does it,no one will think of carding us. Besides, mabe then Bobby can meet us and have some fun with the rest of the group as well, so we don't stand out so much.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Are you sure this is okay with you?&quot; Bobby asked on last time. 
<br />
            &quot;Take your best shot,&quot;Jeanine shot back.
<br />
            &quot;Okay,&quot; Bobby answered,&quot;Jeanine first.&quot;
<br />
            And with that, Jeanine began to change, as she passed into her twenties and then early thirties, putting on a pound or two and starting to look more matronly.
<br />
            &quot;You really weren't kidding, were you? Oh well, as long as you meet us later, and there are a few available men my age, I'll forgive you.&quot;
<br />
             She kept aging, going through middle age and hitting her late forties. Her hair showed more and more faded blonde, with white hairs creeping in more and more.Her cheeks looked a bit more hollow, and some light wrinkles had begun to show.
<br />
             It kept going, until she hit 65.Her hair showed mainly white now with hints of blonde here and there. 
<br />
             &quot;Well,&quot; she said taking out a compact and checking her appearance,&quot;I look pretty decent for a senior citizen, don't ya think Stacey dear?&quot;
<br />
             &quot;Oh, you're wonderful,&quot;Stacey smiled,&quot;and you can make me 65 as well. I wouldn't let my buddy face this alone now, would I?
<br />
             So, Bobby did the same to Stacey, leaving her a slightly withered woman with faded red her, and a white streak in her bangs. 
<br />
            They proceeded to finish getting their cards, with the girls bidding him a farewell, and telling him where to meet them later. 
<br />
            &quot;By the way,&quot; Stacey remarked,&quot;this can be reversed can't it?&quot; 
<br />
          &quot;Well, maybe not reversed,&quot;Bobby answered,&quot;but transfered.Look, don't worry, I'll make sure to make you younger later.Just remember though, you were the ones that asked for it.&quot;
<br />
          &quot;Teach us to take him more seriously,&quot;Jeanine said to her friend as they wandered away.&quot;Let's stop by the Walmart before the party tonight, I need to pick up some reading glasses in order to figure out the drink menu.&quot;
<br />
           As Bobby made his way further down the mall, he saw a fifty year old woman, and made her nineteen, while aging a couple in their twenties to middle age. 
<br />
           He did a few more unconscious changes, and by the time he made it to the bookstore, he had quite the trail of babies, middle aged and old ladies in his wake.
<br />
       &quot;Woah, talk about powerful stuff,&quot; I'll have to be more careful.&quot;
<br />
         He headed into the bookstore,deciding to try and be more aware of his thoughts instead of letting his mind wander quite so much.</p>
