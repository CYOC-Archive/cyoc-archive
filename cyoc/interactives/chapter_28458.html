<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can I go home now?&quot; Charlene said. &quot;Please? Can I? I'm lucky if my e-mail <br />
account isn't erased, whose to say if I can get my job back! My family likely <br />
thinks I'm dead!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still want to go?&quot; Janice asked, -again-, someone else was leaving. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the more so -because- of those reason, I have to do a lot to get my life <br />
back on track! The sooner I get started the better!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She's not trying to be harsh Janice.&quot; Barbera said standing near Charlene <br />
which made Janice guess what Barbera's decision had been. &quot;I know <br />
because I feel the exact same way. I love all of you, but I have a family back <br />
home that's waiting for me, worried about me, maybe they've moved on, <br />
maybe they haven't, but I just can't pretend I don't know them anymore. I'm <br />
sure Charlene feels the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene said nothing, she just pouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you guys all find what you're looking for, and hope that you Janice, <br />
and Luna and Erica you too, do beat that bastard Karther into the ground so <br />
hard he comes up off the coast of Australia. But my family is -my- <br />
responsibility too. Please don't think me a coward for this. If I didn't have a <br />
family waiting back home, I'd join you in this but... I just can't go into a battle <br />
with abandon with my family never having a clue what happened to me. I'm <br />
sorry, but that's just how I feel.&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlene tried to find works that matched Barbera. In the end she just had to <br />
settle for. &quot;I'm just tired of this. I don't care that much about the absolute and <br />
total violation of my body anymore, I just want to get on with my life, my -real- <br />
life. Just let me cut my loses and let me -go home-.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If that's your choice Charlene, I'm not going to ask you to change it.&quot; Viki said <br />
reminding everyone she was there. &quot;But do NOT pretend that you're not going <br />
to miss us. Don't pretend you won't ever think of us. Don't pretend, that we <br />
don't mean anything to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlene closed her eyes, not wanting to look anything in the eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Visit the land of the rising sun sometime.&quot; Anna injected, &quot;Maybe you'll be <br />
unlucky, I mean fortunate enough to run into me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore her, she's just trying to spook you.&quot; Keiko added. &quot;I think.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna stay in my home town.&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I've <br />
had enough interesting times to last two lifetimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa meanwhile, looked at Erica and Luna, then Keiko and Anna, and finally <br />
Barbera and Charlene. She then stole a glance at Viki, who was keeping an <br />
equal distance from all three group. Lisa inched towards her. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we're alive when this is all over, mind if I stop for a visit?&quot; Erica asked. <br />
<br />
Tabra shook her head, she was afraid they didn't still quite get it, she just <br />
hoped they did soon enough, their choices had been made, they couldn't be <br />
taken back anymore than a baby could be put back into their womb. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure how the landlords might feel about divine entities looking like <br />
something off an internet site...&quot; Charlene said, though this time a little less <br />
heartedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won't be listening in.&quot; Tabra said. &quot;If you change your mind and decide you <br />
want to fight later, or ditch your old life for a new one, I won't be in a position to <br />
hear you. I won't be able to help you guys for a while win or lose. If you decide <br />
to come back to Israel, you'll have to do it the old fashioned way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Barbera nodded. &quot;I still hope you guys win, even if I'm not there <br />
with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; Charlene said. &quot;Save Lucy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We will.&quot; Erica replied, her voice carrying purpose and will all it's own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's get started.&quot; The senior angel fox said stepping right up to Barbera <br />
first. Tebra didn't bother with a pretense, she decided she'd just do a quick <br />
watch and learn for Janice. <br />
<br />
<br />
Barbera started as Janice/Tabra kissed on her the forehead, it felt like the skin <br />
her lips had touched were on fire for a few moment before settling down, <br />
when she felt her forehead, she didn't feel any damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang.&quot; The senior angel fox said shaking her head. &quot;Those always make me <br />
dizzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Barbera asked wondering if Janice had become lesbian. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark of truth, what it does basically is makes sure that your family and friends <br />
will recognize you for -you- when you meet them. I'm normally supposed to <br />
give out those only in extreme circumstances since they're bending the rules, <br />
but I figured you lot deserve it. You've had enough to endure without your <br />
parents, girlfriend, and employer screaming at the site of you and calling <br />
animal control.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Barbera asked her next question carefully. &quot;Will they remember me as I used <br />
to be? Or as I am right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's your choice, but once you make it, you can't undo it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You've been saying that a lot lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I've been saying it for a long long time. What's the point of a decision <br />
if there are any consequences to it? There is no point to cause if there is no <br />
effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see anything.&quot; Charlene said skeptically. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that kind of mark.&quot; The senior angel fox said. 'Janice, can you do <br />
Charlene? Don't be scared, just play through my recent memory.'<br />
<br />
Janice wasn't sure about this, being currently female, she wasn't too thrilled at <br />
kissing another female. 'Isn't there another way to do it?'<br />
<br />
'Haven't you ever heard of platonic feelings? This is your good-bye kiss. Is <br />
she your sister or not? Don't pretend there's a middle ground where she can <br />
be 'sorte' your sister when you feel like it. And it's not that at all anyway... you <br />
can't put off saying good-bye, you'll only make it worse the longer you hold it <br />
off.' <br />
<br />
Janice surrendered, and planted the kiss on Charlene's forehead, feeling a bit <br />
like Glinda of the North from Wizard of Oz. <br />
<br />
'Where do you think they got the inspiration?' Tabra injected. <br />
<br />
Janice played through what Tabra had done, feeling the divine aura leaving <br />
behind a mark that created a minor aura of truth around the person who it <br />
held, so that truth could never be mistaken for a lie. <br />
<br />
What the four normal vixens couldn't see was the symbol of Truth left behind <br />
on the forehead of Charlene and Barbera, visible as plain as day. <br />
<br />
Barbera thought of something gastly. &quot;You aren't going to erase our memories <br />
of all this are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice managed to be sync long enough to say together. &quot;I'd die <br />
before doing that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's just that you told us how the super natural has been carefully hidden <br />
from innocent people under the pretense of somehow protecting them, so I <br />
was scared that-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I've hated it since day one and refused to be any part of that, it screws <br />
with people's choices, I could never be a part of that.&quot; Tabra said keeping an <br />
amazing amount of self control. This was the breaking up of a family, he knew <br />
better than to let out his frustration at the world here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should get a name tag for which one of you is speaking.&quot; Julio <br />
said, everyone looked at him, &quot;I'll be quite a bit longer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now comes the relatively simple part, Keiko, Anna, would you mind as a <br />
practice run of your new talents and free Barbera and Charlene of their sand <br />
armor?&quot; <br />
<br />
The two kitesune looked at each other, nodded, then walked around the two <br />
vixens, calmly brushes their collection of tails against the humanoid foxes. <br />
The kitesune magic undid the kitesune magic and the sand armor fell apart. <br />
Julio took a very big hint and turned around and didn't even think of looking <br />
back, the angel foxes had been out of his line of sight thankfully before now. <br />
(not that they would have found themselves minding all that much) Though he <br />
did have to dodge a spear thrown at him. <br />
<br />
'I've got this one Janice, creating mundane clothing is an ability you already <br />
have down pat.' Tabra put a hand one each of the in the fur vixens' shoulders. <br />
Tabra calmly pulled out the proto-matter out of it's subspace pocket and <br />
altered it's base structure into something practical for the two ladies to wear. <br />
He left some base instruction in the proto-matter and let it do the work as it <br />
scanned their surface thoughts and altered themselves to what they found. <br />
Both vixen were surprised by what they were wearing. <br />
Charlene was now in a jacket, shirt and tie and matching black pants. While <br />
Barbera wore blue jeans and a 'Top of the Food Chain' shirt. <br />
&quot;Impossible.&quot; Said Barbera looking at her clothes in awe.  &quot;I was wearing this <br />
shirt the day Karther kidnapped me.&quot; <br />
&quot;But Karther destroyed these.&quot; Charlene added. She check her pockets to find <br />
her photo ID (a bit altered) her keys and the change she had had on her at the <br />
time. Barbera did the same finding a photo of her family just where she <br />
always kept it. <br />
<br />
&quot;He did.&quot; Tabra explained. &quot;I just used a little trick to make these things into a <br />
reasonable fact-similarly of the clothes you were wearing before Karther <br />
kidnapped you. With some modifications for your changed body shape and <br />
extra appendage of course. Sorry, shoes don't exactly fit those feet. Before <br />
you go through, we aren't quite done.&quot; She turned towards Viki and Lisa. &quot;That <br />
leaves just you two, have you decided?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa took a step back, clearly meaning that she was submitting to Viki's <br />
choice, or wanted to be dead last. <br />
<br />
Viki looked at Lisa, not knowing weather to be surprised or not by her putting <br />
off the question again. <br />
She also looked at her sisters and at each of their choices. She thought of <br />
Lucy and Natalie, and knew she only had one real choice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me join you, as a solider of heaven then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra sighed, even as Janice felt a internal leap of joy. Sure, she knew that <br />
this meant Viki would be in danger but... at least she wouldn't lose another <br />
sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't some sport club you can join, do your thing and drop out of, and this <br />
isn't some weekend getaway you can just do as a part time job Viki.&quot; Tabra <br />
warned. &quot;This is a lifetime commitment. You're sealing your fate if you make <br />
this choice, you will continue to exist as a Messenger even after your body <br />
dies. Though I can promise you, this won't make death any more pleasant!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As everyone has pointed out, I'm the oldest sister here... where that bound <br />
was created by Karther's slavery is meaningless, Lucy and Natalie are also <br />
my responsibility. I won't abandon them. As a cop I was taught to always look <br />
after your partner. Or partners in this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a decent change you'll be killed before this whole mess is finally <br />
resolved.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a New York city cop! Tell me something I don't know!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All right then.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Why are you so reserved against my sisters joining us?' Janice asked. 'I <br />
thought you'd enjoy the company of your own kind.' <br />
<br />
'OUR kind: Because I know the weight that comes with this duty more than <br />
any human could. You've seen my memories, you know this job isn't a game. <br />
Anyone who goes onto the battle field has to understand that.'   <br />
<br />
'I'm sure they do.'<br />
<br />
'I hope so.' <br />
<br />
Tabra put her hands on Viki's shoulder, as she had with Eric and Luna. She <br />
didn't bother telling her that this was going to hurt, she knew that already. 'All <br />
yours Janice.'<br />
<br />
Janice carefully undid the lock on Viki, then undid the lock on herself, and she <br />
felt the angelic essence rush out of her, and rush into Viki. <br />
<br />
Viki screamed as the incredible amount of power crashed into her body, filling <br />
it utterly, she felt the very foundation of her spirit be rebuilt, then was amazed <br />
that she could actually -feel- her spirit at all. The white flash filled the room for <br />
the third time.<br />
Lisa noticed how like the two other times, there was now a small glass <br />
impression in the same from where Viki was standing. The sand armor she <br />
had been wearing was obliterated as she was transfigured. <br />
The intense pain in every cell in Viki body vanished in an instant, and she <br />
blinked as the universe came back into a clearer focus than she could ever <br />
remember it having before. <br />
<br />
Tabra nearly stumbled backwards from the essence transfer, but kept her <br />
balance, while her power would regenerate faster, it didn't make this part any <br />
easier, in particular when doing it three times in a row! <br />
<br />
'We can take a break, hold this off till tomorrow.' Janice said automatically <br />
hoping Lisa would be joining them too.<br />
<br />
'No. My, our body can take it. Besides, we need to puts this to rest and move <br />
on Janice.'<br />
<br />
'Just don't fade from existence on me.'<br />
<br />
'Heh.. so you do care.'<br />
<br />
'Huh? Oh! Well, you -did- save my life, and that of my sisters.' <br />
<br />
'Thanks for not saying 'if you hadn't interfered then Tammy wouldn't be <br />
Tamthis right now.' '<br />
<br />
'I'd be a will less pleasure toy of Karther still if not for you. Or a clone of poor <br />
Tammy.'<br />
<br />
'Thank you.' <br />
<br />
'Why are you thanking me?'<br />
<br />
'Because gratitude from the people I work with isn't something I normally get.' <br />
<br />
Viki meanwhile stretched the muscles in her new wings, feeling the blood <br />
flowing into them. Everything was more attune with her, everything around her <br />
made more sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the family big sister.&quot; Luna let out a kind hearted laugh. <br />
<br />
Viki made a small jump upwards and was lifted off the ground for a few <br />
seconds, her wings, her material wings, didn't move a muscle, her -real- <br />
wings, the ones she could see on herself and her sisters who had chosen this <br />
path but could before, where what lifted her. <br />
<br />
Most didn't think the color brown could be beautiful, most would consider this <br />
an oxymoron, but Viki's new brown fur was beautiful, as beautiful as a sunrise. <br />
It shined as she stayed still, and shifted between shades and tones as she <br />
moved, yet always maintaining it's harmony. The feathers on Viki's mundane <br />
wings carried this effect to the next step, every feather being an ever shifting <br />
combination of different shades and tones as they moved, somehow always <br />
keeping the balance with each other. She had no gem stone, but her eyes <br />
were the most intense color of amber imaginable, you felt you could lose <br />
yourself in those eyes and you wouldn't mind the visit. Her hair been granted <br />
the same nature flowing naturally in an unseen breeze almost.  She still had <br />
Tabra's crucifix around her neck. <br />
Her motions held a presence that made every last one of her sisters pay <br />
attention to her and made sure they didn't miss a word she said or a thing she <br />
did if she wished it. <br />
Instead of thanking Tabra or embracing her transmuted sisters however, her <br />
first words were as an angel were, &quot;Lisa, you have a choice to make, <br />
whatever it is, no one will think less of you for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Lisa felt weak looking into Viki's new eyes, her knees almost gave out, but <br />
those eyes held her. <br />
She looked at the divine forms of her four sisters and said, &quot;I've already made <br />
choice. I want to be like you, I want to be with you. Let me be with all of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa actually walked up to Tabra/Janice without waiting for the angel to do so, <br />
and actually took Tabra's hands and put them on her own shoulders. &quot;Please, <br />
I know what you've been saying this whole time, but please, do this -before- I <br />
can change my mind! Please!&quot; <br />
<br />
'Tabra, are you sure you still have the strength to-.'<br />
<br />
'Watch me! Or rather, watch her.' <br />
<br />
'No, 'get out while you can speech' for her?'<br />
<br />
'I've seen this kind of resolve before, it's best to grant it's request.'<br />
<br />
This time Tabra undid the locks, but Janice felt the 'blood/organ/self <br />
transference all the same. <br />
<br />
Lisa screamed, and tears came down her face. She felt such pain! The pain <br />
was incredible! She didn't know it was possible to feel this sort of pain! If <br />
Tabra wasn't holding her up she'd have collapsed to the new glassy floor. The <br />
sand armor shattered. Lisa felt two new appendages grow from her back, and <br />
again felt two grow from her spirit. And realized she could feel her spirit as a <br />
separate part of herself, or rather, felt her spirit -as- herself, and that body was <br />
just a body, nothing more, nothing less, something that in the long run held no <br />
true meaning. The confusion and dismay she had felt over losing her species <br />
and gender was washed away, and she could see them for the transient <br />
elements they were. She felt at peace, somehow whole, complete, more than <br />
she ever was before. <br />
She didn't even realize the pain had stopped, the pain had actually stopped <br />
mattering a short bit ago.<br />
<br />
Lisa was like a vision, a peeking Julio too conceded this fact. <br />
Sandy beige fur covered her body and tail consistently, her mundane wings <br />
spread fully. A red gem stone stone in her forehead, shaped like a tear. Her <br />
eyes were slightly disturbing, they were like pools of blood. While she didn't <br />
command the same presence that Viki did, she moved as gracefully and <br />
smoothly as any of them. With childlike curiosity she examined every inch of <br />
her body, every last one of her wings, and looked at herself in the glass at her <br />
feet. <br />
Julio was expecting her to shrink at her own appearance. She did no such <br />
thing, she just accepted her appearance as such, and knew she was <br />
beautiful. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm happy to have you with us little sister!&quot; Lisa suddenly said in a hug and <br />
wrapped her mundane wings around her, this was quickly joined in by Erica <br />
and finally Luna. <br />
<br />
 'I was half expecting one of us to turn blue.' Janice thought. <br />
<br />
'We can't all be Krystal from Star Fox, sorry.' <br />
<br />
'Isn't red supposed to be an evil color?'<br />
<br />
'You're thinking too Hollywood. And to note, in some cultures white is evil and <br />
black is good. And remember, Opposite Number was the single most beautiful <br />
angel in Heaven, really charismatic too.'<br />
<br />
'Looks can -still- be deceiving, got it.'  <br />
<br />
<br />
Viki asked. &quot;Lisa... why did you chose to become like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I well... to be honest, I wanted to stay with the largest group who was going to <br />
stick together. I didn't care which one. But... I'm very VERY happy that I chose <br />
this one.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So am I.&quot; Janice said calmly. 'No words Tabra?'<br />
<br />
'She's not the first to make a life changing decision based on family, and she <br />
won't be the last.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we're all decided and everything has been done.&quot; Tabra said, &quot;It's <br />
time to say good-bye.&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlene seemed relieved, she was scared they were going to try and press <br />
gang her into this winged group. Barbera felt a slight bang of regret at what <br />
she just missed out on, see the five angels just, well, together, but she had <br />
already made her choice, and thinking of her family at home was all she <br />
needed to cement that choice. <br />
<br />
Anna seemed eager to get started on her new career choice. While Keiko <br />
looked slightly hesitant to leave. <br />
<br />
Julio watched amazed as the angels moved among their sisters, flowing like <br />
the wind, whispering words of love and endearment and promises to <br />
someday meet again. <br />
The two kitsune and vixens shuddered with the intensity of the moment, and <br />
again wondered for a moment, just a moment, if they had made the right <br />
choice, but there was no turning back now. <br />
The eight way good-bye lasted well over an hour, with various words of 'good-<br />
bye' and 'see you again.' <br />
The angel's heart felt, the vixen's approachable, and the kitesune's up beat <br />
fair wells becoming the mix the which of that Julio in his two thousand plus life <br />
had never seen, and likely wasn't to see again. He was sure to memorize <br />
every detail. <br />
<br />
Finally, everything that could be said, was said, and all that was left was the <br />
departing. <br />
<br />
'Janice, this one is all yours.' <br />
<br />
'Eh?'<br />
<br />
'Forgive me, but you need the practice... you can teleport them with you one at <br />
a time.'<br />
<br />
'From down here?! Across the planet?'<br />
<br />
'You're still thinking like a human.'<br />
<br />
'I am a ....' She looked at herself,  'okay, maybe not.' <br />
<br />
'The mass is the only really thing that matters, distance is almost meaningless, <br />
you'd half to go across a solar system before it started to matter.' <br />
<br />
'You sound like you've tried it before.'<br />
<br />
'There's more in the universe than just Earth girl. You humans find out Earth's <br />
not the center of the cosmos and you still think it's the only spot in creation <br />
worth while. Okay Janice, to be fair, we'll do this systematically.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Anna.&quot; Tabra said, the fox looked at her, &quot;You're first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitesune nodded and moved to the angel fox. <br />
<br />
'Now, look into my memories, then picture this place, now draw a line in your <br />
mind between those two points you see. Now shrink the line down, until there <br />
is no straight line, until the two locations overlap, that's it, don't force it, let it. <br />
You don't need to be touching Anna but it'll make things easier.' <br />
<br />
Janice picked up Anna in her arms, her five tails getting everywhere. <br />
<br />
'Now step across the room, not this room, but the room you see within your <br />
mind's eye and your spirit will do the rest. No! Not out of our body, take it with <br />
you, and ... and... that's it!' <br />
<br />
Janice's mundane wings glowed bright white, solid white, and she enclosed <br />
herself and Anna, and in a flash, they were gone. <br />
<br />
They were here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Behold, on the border between modern technology and the middle ages. <br />
They know what antibiotics are, and they know the Earth goes around the <br />
sun, but you don't any Playstation in this small home town.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were on a hill over looking a village sill covered in the morning mist as <br />
the sun rose. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's funny, it still feels like I'm going home.&quot; Anna said, &quot;I guess it's this new <br />
body, but I really can't bring myself to care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're waiting for you Anna, they're waiting for -you-.&quot; 'In a warped way, <br />
Project Return continues after all.' Tabra thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keiko gonna be nearby?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a town a few miles away, maybe you'll end up with a joint place of <br />
worship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... I'd like that.&quot; Then with just a quick, &quot;See ya!&quot; Anna turned invisible to <br />
mundane eyes and skipped and jumped towards the waiting, unsuspecting, <br />
hapless village below. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you kinda helping a rival religion?&quot; Janice said forgetting to speak <br />
mentally for a moment. <br />
<br />
'Not quite, if Operation Return is allowed to go foreword, they won't be able to <br />
KEEP our kind from acting in the open... heh... the atheists will sure have an <br />
interesting day.' Tabra expected some kind of retort from Janice, she got <br />
none, not even a feeling of negative emotion. <br />
<br />
'Okay, let's go get back Keiko, good-bye Anna.' With Tabra's instructions, <br />
Janice teleported again. <br />
<br />
Everyone asked if everyone had gone all right, Janice answered the best she <br />
could. Soon enough though, it was Keiko's turn. The kitesune gave her sisters <br />
all one finally good-bye, and hugged Janice the best she could. Still kneeling <br />
in the huge, Janice closed her mundane wings around them, and carried <br />
them instantly to Keiko's new home. <br />
<br />
She asked about Anna of course, she seemed kinda scared she'd in this <br />
alone, but Tabra told her how with what she knew, she had little to worry <br />
about. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you'll made a good village kami Keiko.&quot; Janice encouraged. <br />
<br />
Keiko accepted these words, and kindly saying saying that they'd meet again <br />
next couple centuries, and amazing herself at how calmly she said that, she <br />
entered her waiting new hometown much as Anna had. <br />
<br />
'If that's the way kitesune are supposed to be. Then why is Karther humanoid <br />
along with all his slaves?'<br />
<br />
'Because he's a perverted deviant who fell in love with the human form. Only <br />
one leader has ever been Perfect Janice, and Karther isn't him. However he <br />
was the stronger magic user of the oldest of the kitesune families so the job <br />
automatically fell on him. Hopefully when Karther is removed the next kitsune <br />
will be a lot more sane.'<br />
<br />
Janice realized something. 'You're hoping it's Keiko aren't you?'<br />
<br />
'Why not? She's a full fledge kitesune now, she knows what it's like to be a <br />
slave, she's not likely to force transformations on people, mental changes <br />
even less so!'<br />
<br />
'But, she's not exactly the most confident sorts, I remember even when she <br />
and I were Karther's brainwashed slaves, she somehow managed to be <br />
meeker than the rest of us.'<br />
<br />
'She has a friend with her, she won't be able to keep Anna away, and maybe <br />
being a guardian will build up the confidence she needs. We'll see... if we get <br />
out of this alive and sane... that's when the real work will begin. But hopefully <br />
this will be the end of the exciting part.' <br />
<br />
'So do I. I just hope the clean up crew doesn't decide my solution isn't quite <br />
good enough.' Tabra said. <br />
<br />
'Meaning?' Janice asked.<br />
<br />
'Stop being scared of looking into my memories, and stop trying to hide yours.'<br />
<br />
'It's the only privacy I have left, just cause we're going to become one person <br />
doesn't mean I have to pretend we already are.'<br />
<br />
'Granted. But back to your original question, if the clean up crew thinks me <br />
giving some of the vixens a chance to start their lives over wasn't good <br />
enough. They'll alter history or perhaps just the perception of reality, so those <br />
who chose the option of becoming Kitesune had been born that way and <br />
have been acting as guardians for those backwater towns and villages for <br />
centuries.' <br />
<br />
'You said hopefully.'<br />
<br />
'Yeah. It all depends if Operation Return is allowed to continue or not. Karther <br />
royally screwed things up. A lot like someone else I used to think I knew. If <br />
Operation Return is given the green light, they'll be no -need- for memory <br />
rewrites anymore... happy day.' <br />
<br />
After watching the sunrise for a bit more, they teleported away. <br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, were angels feared to tread and nobody likes to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mourning Star, what are our orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to sit back, relax, and -watch- this train wreck happen, there's no <br />
need for us to be get directly involved. They'll be plenty for to us salvage out of <br />
the wreckage.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Charlene was eager to be next, unlike the others, though she did make sure <br />
to tell the others that, yeah, like it or not, she -would- miss them. <br />
Janice respected Charlene's personal space, and merely touched her to <br />
make the teleport easier. <br />
<br />
In a flash, having looked in Charlen's memory Janice teleported them to her <br />
family's apartment. Her only hope was that they hadn't moved away. <br />
<br />
Janice wondered for a moment if they were still Japan in the morning, all the <br />
fog everywhere... until she heard some big chimes and saw a familiar giant <br />
clock tower. Big Ben. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't sound British.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karther stole a LOT from me.&quot; Charlene said with finality. &quot;He thought the way <br />
I spoke was annoying.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene said nothing to that, she merely looked at the door on the side of the <br />
building that held her home. Time to find out weather or not his family even <br />
still lived there. <br />
<br />
Tabra wondered if Charlene knew much courage this actually took. All the <br />
same, the fox woman walked up the -thankfully- deserted stairway, and <br />
walked across the open balcony, she finally came to one particular door, and <br />
knocked on it. <br />
<br />
Three minutes and nothing, Charlene however didn't move an inch, neither <br />
did the angel fox. <br />
<br />
Then Charlene's heart skipped a beat, she heard a lock being undone, and <br />
slowing it opened, and Charlene did her best not to shake. <br />
<br />
A late forties woman said a hopeful and desperate look in her eyes. &quot;Charles <br />
my boy is that really you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlene mere nodded, broke down, and a second later the two women were <br />
in tears of joy hugging each other. <br />
<br />
'Mark of truth?'<br />
<br />
'You already know the answer.' They teleported back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Last one.&quot; Janice said not sound at all happy about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Barbera replied. &quot;I'm ready.&quot; She said simply. <br />
<br />
There was nothing left to say, everything had been said, the door had already <br />
been closed. <br />
Janice couldn't hold it in, and hugged Barbera as they teleported, this time <br />
Tabra had to take control to keep them from ended up in the planet's crust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home.&quot; Tabra said surprisingly kind. <br />
<br />
The noise, the stink, the people who just ran this way and that, always in a <br />
hurry, never taking in the sites, power lines, phone lines, and trolly lines all <br />
hanging dangerous low overhead with bobbing hills as far as the eye could <br />
see. This could only be, <br />
<br />
&quot;San Francisco.&quot; Tabra observed for Janice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Barbera replied. &quot;Look, can you please, just go? I don't want to sound <br />
cold but, I just wanna see my family.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As Barbera or as your original self?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't decided yet.&quot; Barbera admitted. &quot;I'll figure something out before I get <br />
there, I always do...Janice, Tabra, thank you so much. I wouldn't be here, back <br />
home, if it weren't you. ... heh...see you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barbera slowly turned around, and began to walk through the city streets. Of <br />
course she got a lot of stares, most told themselves it was just a costume, or <br />
some cos-player who didn't know how to keep it in the convention centers. <br />
This -was- San Francisco after all. But her family wouldn't make such an <br />
assumption, they'd see the truth. <br />
<br />
'Shouldn't we be worried about her?'<br />
<br />
'Don't worry.' Tabra said, 'she's kept all the basic combat knowledge she was <br />
given when Karther made her into a warrior to try and kill me. Worry about any <br />
mugger who tries to attack her.'<br />
<br />
'I thought that part was removed.'<br />
<br />
'Karther's -mark- on her was removed, she's her own person, but she still has <br />
the fighting talent, I figured it was the least I could do, seriously, I mean it, stop <br />
trying to not listen in on my thoughts, it'll save us all a lot of misery.' <br />
<br />
'Maybe.' <br />
<br />
'Let's go to our home.'<br />
<br />
When Janice teleported back, her four sisters, those who had chosen to <br />
remain all looked at her. Waiting for what was to come next. <br />
Janice and Viki looked at each other and stepped closer. Finally they hugged <br />
each other, covering each other in their mundane wings, comforting one <br />
another. True, their four other sisters weren't dead. But they had chosen their <br />
paths, and those paths had now separated. <br />
<br />
All of Julio's previous encounters with angels had each been one on one <br />
affairs. To be here among five, even if four of them were only recently 'born' <br />
was a slightly humbling experience. Though he still felt more than a little <br />
uncomfortable that these all used to be male humans, like him, he admitted, <br />
they did look beautiful. The fact that four of them were nude was enough to <br />
almost give him a nose bleed, if such things actually happened when men got <br />
excited. <br />
<br />
Much later, it was finally Luna who broke the silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;So that's now just leave the question, what do we do about those we have <br />
who are still under Karther's brainwashing? Alexandra? Gene? Lucy? <br />
Natalie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice spoke at the same time through the same mouth. &quot;We save <br />
them, that's what.&quot;</p>
