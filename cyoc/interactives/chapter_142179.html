<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up in bed as I did every single other day. My windows were opened just a crack, letting in a fine freeze that rustled my curtains and flashed light into my eyes. The faint beeping of my neighbor&#39;s alarm clock from the other side of the wall told me it was 6:30-ish. My allergies were acting up again, as they did every spring. Everything else was normal, but I had a distinct feeling that something was wrong about this morning. Reaching for my phone, I pressed the power button to read the date: April 16th.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s odd...&quot; I said to myself. &quot;It was the 14th yesterday... Or, when I slept.&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, it&#39;s not uncommon I&#39;d sleep through an entire day. Being an adult is fifty times harder than I thought it would be. Stress got to me a lot, and sometimes, I&#39;d just crash from it. Normally when this happens, however, I&#39;d be starving the next morning. Today, however, I was not. In fact, I felt oddly full. Maybe there was something wrong with my phone? Yeah, that had to be it.<br />
<br />
Shedding my lovely blanket, I hopped out of bed and walked up to my mirror. I looked perfect, or at least, I didn&#39;t look different.  My long black hair was in a massive tangle that would take a good half hour to get managed. My face was still cute and feminine. My body, unfortunately, was as underdeveloped as usual. That&#39;s not to say I had NO curves, because I did. But if it weren&#39;t for my height, I&#39;d probably be mistaken for a freshmen in highschool, when I was in my third year of college.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until I got to the bathroom that I discovered the watch.<br />
<br />
I hadn&#39;t owned the watch the previous night, and in terms of watches, it was pretty standard. It appeared to be made of silver, or more likely, stainless steel. The face was black with silver hands and silver Roman numerals. It seemed to be perfectly sized to my wrist, like it wouldn&#39;t fit anyone else&#39;s wrist at all. Also, the time was way off. My phone&#39;s clock said it was 6:42 AM, but the watch read 8:15 PM. I&#39;d have to reset the watch at a later time, but I had to take a shower now. I stripped off my pajamas and my underwear, and I tried to take off the watch, but I couldn&#39;t. The latch was stuck, and I couldn&#39;t pull it off past my hands. I&#39;d just have to hope it&#39;s waterproof.<br />
<br />
After my shower, I decided that, since it was the weekend, I&#39;d just sit at home and watch TV all day. I turned on the TV in the living room, and it was already tuned to the news. I went to change it when I noticed that, in the bottom right corner, it also read Feb. 16th. So, it wasn&#39;t my phone&#39;s fault. It really was the 16th. So I had slept through the 15th? But then, where did the watch come from? What happened last night that I didn&#39;t remember?<br />
<br />
I&#39;d find out later, but right now, I had it her issues to worry about. Like a faint buzzing coming from my new watch.<br />
<br />
-on the other side of America-<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;re getting a signal from subject M-14.&quot; Said one employee of OTSE, which stood for Online Transformation Services Enterprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, Hamil!&quot; Said a woman sitting at the front of the huge crowd. &quot;Now that we&#39;ve connected, we can begin configuring her for the tasks ahead. Jensen, send her a simple submissive frequency to start her off.&quot;<br />
<br />
-in another room of the OTSE facility-<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen!&quot; Spoke a cheesy narrator&#39;s voice, which was playing over footage of Hallie, the girl with the silver watch. &quot;Boy, do we have a treat for you fine folks. We&#39;ve just recently picked up a new subject, and she&#39;s prime for the taking! Bidding on the girl&#39;s transformations will begin shortly, but right now, you can vote on what we make the girl do to herself. Get your clicking fingers ready, because voting will start shortly!&quot;<br />
<br />
A series of 5 different commands popped up on the screen, and people began clicking on which one they wanted to to happen to Hallie.<br />
<br />
-back at Hallie&#39;s apartment-<br />
<br />
The buzzing wasn&#39;t noticeable froma normal distance, but when placed directly up to my ear, it was loud and clear. A piercing buzzing that seemed to work it&#39;s way into my head. I wanted to pull the watch away, but something just made me unable to do it. I just sat there and listened to the buzzing. My mind started to become weak and fuzzy, but oh so good! I just wanted to sit there and listen to the buzzing. It was so calming and serene, that I just had to keep listening, even if it hurt my wrist to hold it up to my ears. I though about nothing else but the buzz of the watch. It took over my brain, and made me weak. It made me dull. It made me feel subservient to the time piece. Looking back, I&#39;m stunned by how I actually allowed myself to get brainwashed by the hypnotic tones of a simple watch, but I did. And it haunts me to this day.<br />
<br />
-In the OTSE gameroom-<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty, folks, I&#39;m getting word from our tech department that the girl is now fully submissive. I think we could tell her to kill herself, and she&#39;d do it in a heartbeat.&quot; Despite the grim tone of the line, a laugh track was played. &quot;And it seems that voting is now over. We have a decision on what we&#39;ll be making our little toy do, and that decision is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Text shot up on the screen to reveal what the audience had chose. It was a landslide victory.<br />
<br />
-in Hallie&#39;s Apartment-<br />
<br />
I was there, listening to the tones of the watch, when they stopped abruptly. My mind didn&#39;t stop buzzing, but the watch did. It turned over to a voice. A voice that I would have to listen to until the end of time. It spoke thus:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hallie Mills, I command you to go into your bath tub, unscrew the shower head from the hose, place the hose in your ass, and inflate your stomach until it&#39;s full.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had two consciouses at that point: the one that said what a terrible idea that was, and the one that was already in the tub, naked, unscrewing the shower head.<br />
<br />
Before I could actually grasp what I was really doing, I had shoved the hose as far up my ass as I could physically go. Then I reached around at the faucet, pulled up the tab, and started a slow stream if water into me.<br />
<br />
What came next was a blur of pain, pleasure, embarrassment, and a small bit of lust. I distinctly remember the first gush of water. It plunged through my asshole and into my gut. I was able to move the hose even further into my ass because of this. I remember I felt full in less than a minute&#39;s time, but then came a gurgle, and i was filling up again. Then it happened again. I thought I was at my capacity, but I heard a gurgle, and I was filled a little bit more. I eventually reached my size limit when I threw up a stream of pure water. I ended up yanking out the hose so fast it hurt. Another little voice came from the watch. &quot;Don&#39;t let any water out. Shove something up your ass if you have to.&quot; The next thing I knew, I had a bar of soap up my ass, plugging it up and preventing the large cascade if water from exiting.<br />
<br />
-back in the OTSE game room-<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Talk about a blimp! She got huge for a first timer. Don&#39;t worry folks, the first transformation bid is coming up shortly, but first: how long do your think this bitch can keep that belly of hers? Place your bets now!&quot;</p>
