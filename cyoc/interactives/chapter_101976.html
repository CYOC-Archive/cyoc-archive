<br />
While Eric and Spencer continued their night time chat, Nate was having his own with Kenya. He’d slipped out of the house, after saying a quick goodbye to his parents. He assured them he’d be home before eleven. <br />
<br />
Nate strode out into the woods, the sun setting behind him. He only had to go a little ways before he caught Kenya’s scent. He followed it further and further into the forest, and found her perched atop a branch in her panthress form. Nate took a moment to admire her, gazing at the sunset, the light highlighting her usually hidden spots. <br />
<br />
“Enjoying yourself up there?” Nate asked, setting his backpack down. Kenya turned around, and smiled upon seeing her boyfriend/fiancee. <br />
<br />
“You could join me.” she said, patting the branch. <br />
<br />
“How? Werewolves aren’t known for our ability to climb trees you know.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Get a running start. Come on, you have to put in a little extra leg work to get the prize.” Kenya said, mimicking the iconic leg cross from “Basic Instinct”. Which gave Nate more than enough of an incentive to try.<br />
<br />
After stripping and shifting into his werewolf form, Nate walked back a few steps. Then ran towards the tree, and leapt up. He was surprised at how high up he went. He grabbed the nearest branch, but was left swinging from it. <br />
<br />
“Never was any good at pull ups in gym.” he said with an embarrassed smile on his face. Kenya laughed, as Nate hung from the tree branch. <br />
<br />
He planted his feet on the side of the trunk, and tried to sort of climb up. It worked, until the branch snapped under his weight and Nate fell. Thankfully for him, it was only a foot or so drop back to the ground. <br />
<br />
“Ow.” Nate said, landing on his tail. <br />
<br />
“Come on, don’t quit on my now.” Kenya said between laughs. Nate gave her a cheeky look, and tried again. <br />
<br />
He positioned himself further away from the tree before taking a run at it. And this time knew that he’d better pull himself up quickly. Nate only took three long strides before he jumped at the tree. This time his paws found a much sturdier limb, and he hoisted himself up. Or half of himself that is. Nate’s legs still hung in the air, but his chest was at least on the branch. <br />
<br />
“A little help please.” he said, out of breath. Kenya took pity on him, and carefully crawled over to him. <br />
<br />
“It takes practice.” Kenya said. <br />
<br />
“Really? How would you know, you’re designed to climb trees.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“That’s the only way you can get good at anything. Practice, practice, practice. But don’t worry. I’ll love you even if you make a complete fool out of yourself trying. It’s quite a sight, a werewolf swinging from the trees like a monkey.” Kenya laughed again. <br />
<br />
Nate rolled his eyes and gave her a kiss on her cheek. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad you get such a kick out of it. But how about we do something on the ground now?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Lead the way.” Kenya said, a slight purr to her voice. <br />
<br />

<br />
Earlier in the Twist house…<br />
<br />
Francis and Samantha were cuddled up together on their couch, watching TV. They’d already had their dinner and dessert (wink), and were still in their fursonas. They would have just gone straight to bed, but they were waiting up for Ben, who had yet to return from Alex’s. <br />
<br />
“Eventful day…” Francis said, teasing her wife’s ears. Samantha purred and sighed in the same breath. <br />
<br />
“I hope that’s all the excitement around here for the next year.” she said.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think for you it will be. But things on my end are probably going to get pretty interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Oh? How so?” Samantha asked. <br />
<br />
“Just some interesting developments with a couple of patients.” Francis said. She couldn’t discuss the details, confidentiality rules. But she knew Samantha already knew about some of her patients’ personal lives. <br />
<br />
William referred Harry and Jenny to her, since Harry was having some serious stress issues regarding his telling his parents about the existence of weres, his becoming a werefox, and his getting married. Now there was the added stress related to his breaking the news of Jenny’s pregnancy. Francis was surprised the poor boy hadn’t started losing clumps of hair or fur yet. <br />
<br />
And then Francis was going to start seeing Spencer on Monday. That was going to prove to be quite the challenge, since Spencer was about as much an open book as a Francis was into men. <br />
<br />
“Never a dull moment around here…” Samantha muttered. <br />
<br />
“I’m home!” Ben announced his entrance into the house only a few seconds later. He gave his moms a hug before going into the kitchen to get something to eat. <br />
<br />
“Have a good day?” Francis asked, turning around to watch Ben scavenge. Samantha turned the TV off, and also moved around to face her son. <br />
<br />
“Ya. I’m just gonna grab a snack and go to bed. Gotta get up early tomorrow for the game” Ben said excitedly. <br />
<br />
While neither of his mothers were big football fans, they were glad Ben was enjoying himself. After giving up soccer, he’d been so bored during the fall until he tried out for the football team. It wasn’t Ben’s favorite sport, but he certainly liked having something active to do. <br />
<br />
“What time should we be there?” <br />
<br />
“The earlier the better. Game doesn’t start until noon, but I’m guessing parking is going to be tricky.” Ben said, putting together a sandwich from cold cuts he found. <br />
<br />
“When are you going over?” Francis asked. <br />
<br />
“Around ten. Are Nate and Eric still going?”<br />
<br />
“As far as I know, why? Did they say something to you?” Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
“No, but I just assumed since they’ve both got girlfriends now…” <br />
<br />
“Nate has a girlfriend?” Both Francis and Samantha asked. They knew Nate was seeing someone, but they didn’t know it had gotten that serious. <br />
<br />
“That happened almost as quickly as Eric and Spencer’s hook up (so to speak).” Francis thought. <br />
<br />
“Ya, sort of. He didn’t give me many details, but she’ll be joining the Andersons for dinner tomorrow night. We’ll get to meet her then. And of course Eric’s with Spencer, who can’t leave the house during the day. I just assumed he’d be at her place.” Ben said. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, maybe not. Maggie said they were going over to Elle’s house to spend the morning with her parents.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“Huh, alright. Well, I’m going to bed. Night.” Ben said, popping the last of his sandwich in his mouth and walking into his bedroom. Francis and Samantha waved, and then looked at each other with the same expression on their furry faces. <br />
<br />
“It would appear love is in the air.” Francis said. <br />
<br />
“I agree. Even Ben’s been affected, though he’s not showing it.”<br />
<br />
“You think so?”<br />
<br />
“He’s been spending a lot more time with Alex recently. They’ve been going out for what, a year now? And I know they haven’t really gotten serious, they mostly go out on casual dates or hang out. But I can see them together for the foreseeable future.”  <br />
<br />
“That’d be nice. Alex’s a great catch, and his family is wonderful.” <br />
<br />
“And with Ben going off to college in a few years…” Samantha really purred this time. She straddled Francis, and started grinding against her stomach. Francis purred too, as the fur on her torso became wet from Samantha’s fluids. <br />
<br />
“We’ll have the house all to ourselves.” Samantha crooned, leaning in to kiss Francis.</p>
