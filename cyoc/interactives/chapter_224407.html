<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Y-yes. Is that bad?&quot; Chris questioned, feeling a touch uneasy from the change as well. An unease that she could tell was coming from her own transformation beginning to draw to a close.<br />
<br />
Anne brought a dainty gloved hand to her face, tapping her chin thoughtfully. &quot;Hmm... Nay, Lady Charlotte. I do say it does indeed feel normal. Oh and it does sound most lovely! But I wonder If I can utilize mine own -er, rather, my- uh... oh, yes. Hmm, speaking in my former common tongue seems too difficult now. I believe even your own words do not seem any the lesser than the sound of my own!&quot; Anne shook her head, trying her best to remove those thoughts, those ideas, to speak normally. It was useless. As she tried harder and harder to find her normal speech pattern, the more the regal mannerisms dug in, seemingly cemented into her mind. Even just imagining not using her &quot;royal voice&quot; was difficult, if not impossible. This is how she was expected to speak. This is how she should speak. She had to accept it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, her brain, the very fabric that made her the person she was, continued rewiring. Ideas about herself began to change. Things that used to bother her no longer did, and other things, trivial matters, things that seemed to be trivial mattered a whole lot. What used to be important to her no longer really applied. She was a princess, and would be expected to think and act a certain way. The most important things to her now were the colour of her lips, how she wore her hair, and if she wore a shiny jewel or a pretty necklace to show herself off. In short, she thought about superficial things, but they weren&#39;t superficial to her. A girl had to look good, after all.<br />
<br />
Anne&#39;s memories remained. It&#39;s not like they had been erased or had her brain totally reprogrammed to reflect that of a princess. However, certain things had shifted around. People&#39;s names had been changed to reflect their proper titles, their home town became a royal city in her mind, her daily routine involved taking time for her appearance and standing up straight. She felt, in her soul, that it had always been this way, that she had always been Princess Anastasia Alexandra Eleanora Couperrier of Dauphine. Even her own name had changed, along with her outlook and perception of the world.<br />
<br />
For Chris, it was much the same, her world rearranged and the role of a proper princess fitted over her mind and soul, like an ill-fitting wig or coat, loose and barely remaining. While for her dear Anne, now Anastasia, being a proper princess was what was always meant to be, for the new Princess Charlotte Stephanie Morgana Rose Guillard of Dauphine, this was not the case. This wasn&#39;t how she was raised. This was something alien. No more was she the confident and jubilant Christopher Giles. Now, she was another lady of the court, the perfect princess and next in line for the throne to the grandest of lands, Dauphine. At least, that&#39;s what it felt like to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anne...? No, Princess... Princess Anastasia of...&quot; Chris groaned and held her forehead as the pain of finding that one word came crashing down into her. How was she even pronouncing the name? &quot;Anastasia!&quot; Chris cried, the realization finally dawning on her.<br />
&quot;Milady, for you, I can simply be Anastasia. Leave the formalities aside, now, would you not agree?&quot; Princess Anastasia asked, tilting her head and giving a cute smile.<br />
<br />
The other princess clasped her hands together in a bout of surprised glee, &quot;Oh, Princess Anastasia!&quot; she replied, seemingly unable to drop the honorific, &quot;Those pills! They truly have changed us have they not? We are indeed regal, the perfect pair of princesses!&quot;<br />
&quot;It would indeed seem that we are, milady,&quot; Princess Anastasia sighed as she sat once again on the bed, her large gown rustling as she rested on it. It was difficult not using titles. Those were the rules of etiquette for her new persona, and they were written into her very being. &quot;How does it compare, dear Princess Charlotte? To your native male body? I must say, you do seem awfully composed for someone who just transformed into a lovely young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess Charlotte blushed at the compliment, &quot;Oh why thank you Lady Anastasia! While I can say that the change in looks and anatomy is interesting to say the least, what is indeed more peculiar is my train of thoughts. I suppose the pill has truly done a thorough job in overwriting my mind, has it not. All these silly concerns of etiquette are ones of a truly prim and proper lady. I can see why they would seem so bothersome when in comparison to the concern of one&#39;s beauty. Though I must remark on how well the transformation has eased me into this new state of being! What of you, my dear, Anastasia of Dauphine. How was your transformation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh simply marvelous! As for what I can say for my own experiences, the effects of the pill have done wonders with my train of thoughts.&quot; Princess Anastasia sighed and ran her gloved hands along her skirts. &quot;My mind is indeed not so different from how it has always been, though perhaps more of my memories and concerns have shifted, to be more regal in nature, though there does appear to be more surface level matters than what I once cared to focus upon. Such as my clothes! It does appear as though my gown has transformed alongside myself. And it appears the same has applied to yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess Charlotte nodded, &quot;Yes, it would appear as such. A most regal change indeed! The craftsmanship of this gown is superb! I feel as if it has been woven from the finest fabrics in all of the land and crafted by the greatest seamstress in all the realm. Surely, these are the threads that have been worn by the likes of the divine and royal princesses of yore!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would most certainly agree, milady! Such finery should be worn by the divine! Though I do believe that the princesses of Dauphine are regal enough to be able to wear such exquisite garments. Perhaps we are closer to the divine than we believe?&quot; Princess Anastasia chuckled.<br />
&quot;Yes, I would most certainly agree with you, dearest Princess Anastasia! But tell me, what do you make of the other effects? Of the... changes to our bodies?&quot; Princess Charlotte inquired, &quot;I would most certainly like to know what you think of my own transformation. After all, we are both princesses and should be able to share such intimate details of ourselves, would you not agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, milady! We are of the highest station and should be able to share anything with one another, as is the way of nobility.&quot; Princess Anastasia smiled. &quot;Well, in my humble opinion, I would most certainly say that the change in body is quite agreeable. To have the figure and curves of a princess is a most lovely thing, indeed. Not only that, but the softness of my skin, and the shine of my hair and eyes! Truly, I feel as though I am more radiant than ever before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess Charlotte nodded in agreement, &quot;Yes, I must say, you do indeed look much more radiant than ever before, dearest Princess Anastasia. You are indeed a sight to behold! If I were not already so fond of you, I would say I have fallen in love at first sight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Princess Charlotte, that is so kind of you to say!&quot; Anastasia giggled. &quot;You are indeed most radiant as well! Your luscious locks and clear complexion are divine! I feel as though I could simply stare at your face for hours and never get bored! Truly, you are a beauty beyond words!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anastasia&#39;s words rang true. However, the two couldn&#39;t help but notice that their attraction to one another was not the same as it once was. Before, they were a romantic couple. Chris and Anne. Boyfriend and girlfriend. But now…?</p>
