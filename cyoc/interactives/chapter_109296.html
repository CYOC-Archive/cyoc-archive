<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily looked at all four generations of women all lined up in a row and wondered what to do with them. After much thinking, she came up with a really good idea. She turned to the audience and begins explaining what she’s going to do. “Ladies and gentlemen, what you see on stage is four generations of women. Despite the toddler being born two years ago, the other three women lived through many types of history. So here’s what I’m going to do. Using this hall of mirrors,  I’m going to let them all watch themselves live through all parts of history both in body and mind until Wendy reached the point where she was a newborn baby. The catch? Once each one hits their twenties, they cross through a series of rooms to see their reflections continue the process none the wiser. Leaving us with four generations of a family tree condensed into four young women from progressively younger age groups living radically different lives, Now that sounds like a show! But first, I need to know when each of them were born.”<br />
<br />
She approached Jane and started to talk to her. “Jane,” she said, “can you hear me?” Jane, who was still in her hypnotic trance, responded, “Yes…” Lesily smiled and said, “Good. Now you told me before that your baby girl is two years old. Does that mean that she was born two years ago?” And to that, Jane said in her sleepish state, “Yes. Katie was born in 2009 when I was thirty. I was planning to be pregnant when I reach that age after marriage.” Lesily listened in and was delighted by the sound of it. “Ah… Planned pregnancy.” she said, “When you know you are ready to raise a child. Now tell me, when were you born?” Jane answered, “I was born in 1979.” “Good.” Lesily said with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
She then walked to Michelle and asked the same thing. “Now Michelle,” she started, “I know your name but I don’t know how old you are. What is your age?” Just like Jane, Michelle was in a complete trance and said, “I’m 68 years old.” “And how old were you when you gave birth to your daughter?” asked Lesily. “I gave birth to Jane when I was 36.” Michelle answered, “I had a late pregnancy and I tried constantly to have a baby.” Lesily rubbed her chin and find that completely intriguing. “Very interesting…” she said, “And what year you were born.” To that, Michelle told the woman, “1943.”<br />
<br />
Soon after she said that, Lesily headed to the eldest of the group and told her what she told the others. “Wendy, how old are you now?” Wendy was half asleep too as she blurted out, “95 deary…” Lesily’s eyes were wide and couldn’t believe that. “95?” she said, “Wow, you must be so old! I bet you lived a very long life.” Wendy smiled and responded, “Oh yes deary, I sure did. And all this time living were the happiest years of my life.” Lesily smiled and could tell this was going to be good. “So tell me Wendy, how old were you when you gave birth to Michelle?” she asked in curiosity. “Oh deary, I brought Michelle into this world in 1943.” said Wendy, “I was 27 at the time and was a rowdy woman back then.” “So I see…” said Lesily out of interest, “And when were you born.?” In her sleepless state, Wendy said, “1916”.<br />
<br />
Listening to all of the women, Lesily approached the stage and told the audience about them. “As you can see, all four generations lasted almost a hundred years, meaning they went through all types of historical events. It’s now time for them to relive their history lesson.” She stepped aside just to let the audience watch the show and started to talk to all the women. “Now ladies,” she started, “It’s time to take you back in time. What I’ll do make you all remember back to any points of time, from there you will stop until I continue. Do you understand?” All three women nodded in unison as the baby stared blankly while wiggling her arms and legs. Smiling, Lesily began the show. “All right ladies, let’s begin. First, I&#39;m going to take Katie behind the mirror while the three of you think back to 2009, back before Katie was born, alright?”<br />
<br />
The baby girl was placed into the lefthand side of the hall of mirrors as a smaller reflection of Katie appeared by Jane&#39;s own. The Jane in the mirror reached out to the diapered newborn as it continued to shrink.  As she was regressing, the other women’s clothes continued to change over the months. As the baby reached newborn status, Jane’s dress vanished and she was completely naked. Just then, she was lying on a hospital bed design to push and give birth to babies. But now she was going to give birth in reverse. As she was lying on the bed, and umbilical cord grew out of Katie’s belly button and wormed its way to Jane’s vagina. Once it plunged through and was connected, the cord pulled Katie further and further into her mother’s lower region. Jane continued to take deep breaths as she could feel the reverse contractions. Within minutes, Katie’s feet plunged deep into her mother’s pussy and then her legs and body. The moment the vagina reached her head, Katie got one last look at the light before the squishy walls closed around her and was surrounded by darkness. Meanwhile, Katie continued and push backwards and backwards until her baby daughter reached her womb, blowing up her stomach. Once that was over with, the hospital bed disappeared and Jane was standing up with a 9-month belly and wearing a maternity dress. But that didn’t stop there.<br />
<br />
Behind the mirror, the Toddler began to grow older as it watched her embryonic self deflate through the months. Slowly, Jane&#39;s reflected pregnancy was going back to eight, then seven, then six, and so on while the Katie in the mirror continues to get undeveloped.  The moment she reached conception, Jane was once again naked and was developing sweat. Immediately, she collapsed on the floor and started to pleasure herself. What she was actually doing was having a reverse orgasm while Katie was nonexistent. The moment she reached self-pleasure, her hips buckled and seaman oozed out of her pussy. The Katie in the mirror was deconcieved while the real Katie in the hall of mirrors had turned six-and-a-half, leaving toddlerhood behind.<br />
<br />
After her having sex in reverse, Jane got up and new clothes appeared consisting of a consecutive business blouse, a tight business skirt that goes down to below the knees, pantyhose, and a pair of 3 inch black heels. Lesily expect that she was working at a professional job during that time. She looked at the remaining three women and could tell that nothing else had changed with the exception of Jane. For she use have faint lines around her eye and mouth and there was a sprinkle of gray strands on her dull brown hair. Now her lines were fainter and there was less gray on her hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! So, let&#39;s check in with cute little Katie, say Hi, little girl!&quot; The now older Katie stepped out of the hall of mirrors to reveal a young early elementary aged child with brown hair and a pink dress shirt. &quot;Uh... Hi?&quot; She brushed her baby blue skirt as she walked over to the three elder generations with Lesily running up to her. &quot;Picture this, 2009, before you were born, three generations of strong-spirited women!&quot;  The two first went to Jane and said, “Jane, what year is it today?” The moment she asked that, Jane said in a hypnotic state, “2009.” “And what are you going to be doing today?” asked Lesily. “Well, after I get through with my job, my husband and I are going to celebrate our third anniversary together and then end it with a little love making.” Jane said in eager anticipation, “I promised myself that when I reach thirty, I’m going to have a baby. Let’s hope that I will make one on the first go.” Lesily smiled, knowing that it would actually happen. &quot;My mommy said I was made by a promise...&quot; Katie shyly asked to her former mother and Jane sheepishly ruffled Katie&#39;s hair, blissfully unaware of the fact that she would have given birth to her. &quot;Well then...She must be very proud of you.&quot; Katie smiled. <br />
<br />
The two then walked to Michelle and ask her something as well. “Michelle, today is 2009. How old are you now.” “66 years old.” said Michelle feeling like she’s in a deep dream. “And what are you planning to do today?” the performer asked. Michelle then smiled and said, “Oh… Just going to meet up with some friends and play some cards. Spending my time in retirement is very relaxing.” Lesily nodded and decided to ask one more thing. “So, your daughter wants to have a baby at thirty. How do you feel about that?” Michelle smiled about that thought and said, “Oh, that would be incredible. Having to be a grandmother for my daughter’s baby would be an amazing thing in my life.” After talking to her, Lesily got Katie to ask Michelle something. &quot;My grandmother&#39;s nice, especially when I hafta stay overnight!&quot; Jane smiled and pinched Katie&#39;s cheeks. &quot;That is a wonderful idea, child!&quot; <br />
<br />
Satisfied with Jane&#39;s comments, the two then went to Wendy and asked her the same thing. “Wendy…” she started, “How old were you and what are you going to do today.” “I’m 93 years old deary.” Wendy said, “And I’m going to be at the retirement center enjoying the remainder of my time there. I lived a long life and I don’t know if there’s anything else to accomplish.” “What about being a great grandmother?” Lesily then blurted out, “Would it be nice that you would have a great grandchild, being that Jane would want one at thirty.” A smile came up to her face as Wendy said, “Why, that would be the final chapter of my life. Living long enough to see another child of the family will be my finest feat yet.” Katie hugged Wendy, held her tight, this indicated the loss of a loved one who had lived almost as long as she did, if not even older. So Wendy hugged Katie back as it only seemed fitting. With all that said, Lesily smiled and backed away from the three, continuing with her show. “Now ladies, time is moving backwards. Go back to the year 2000, the new millennia, where it’s a few seconds after midnight and everyone is celebrating. Think back to where you were and how were you celebrating it.”</p>
