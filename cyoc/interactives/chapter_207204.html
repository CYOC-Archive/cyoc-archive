<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan planned to leave before Kat party started, but their parents caught him before he could. He tried telling his parents what Kat had done, but words failed him or he said something else unrelated to Kat spell. Neither of his parents noticed, as they were busy preparing for Kat party. Dan became fearful as he now knew that spell was real. He tried to be excused from the party, but they denied him that reprieve. <br />
<br />
So when the party started, he kept his distance from Kat. He didn&#39;t want to spelled again. He doesnt even what other spell she cast on him. The whole party was disaster free. So whatever spell Kat did was unrelated to the party or at least didnt activate yet. Dan took the first opportunity he had to go to his room and stay there. <br />
<br />
Unknown to Kat or Dan, the wormhole/portal spell connected Dan mouth to a fleshlight belonging to Kats boyfriend, Jace. The reason the spell hadn&#39;t activated was the fact Jace was at the party. Jace spent the time celebrating his girlfriend and getting to know her family and friends. Jace loves Kat and her family. He would do anything for them. <br />
<br />
Dan was able to stay in his room. Even as the party died down late at night. The only time he left was to use the bathroom and get ready for bed. He also made a point to politely say good night to his family that came for the party before heading to bed. He didnt want to seem rude to his aunt, uncles, cousins, and nieces and nephews that came into town from far and wide. So as the party closed, Dan had already fallen asleep. <br />
<br />
After the party, Jace went home happy and a bit horny. Kat had been teasing him every opportunity she could. Jace had spent the whole party trying not to let his boner show. Kat had laughed amused at him and contiued to do it. So once Jace got home, he took a quick shower and said goodnight to his parents. <br />
<br />
Then went to his room and locked the door. Making sure no one would interrupt him, he went to his closet and pulled down a box with his stash of sex toys and porn magazines. He pulled out a fleshlight with a mouth on it. He grabbed a lube then went to bed. He moved his pillows and blankets around until he found a comfortable position. Once ready, he started to imagine Kat below him about to give him a blowjob, which she had done before. <br />
<br />
Jace rubbed his cock with the lube as he used the lips of the toy to rub his tip. He wanted to take his time visualizing Kat. &quot;Thats it, love. Just like that&quot; Jace says with a soft moan. Dan has his mouth open in his sleep and hasnt registered the phantom touches and taste on his lips yet. <br />
<br />
Jace spent a moment just teasing his own tip and length before putting the lube away. He holds the toy steady as he starts to enter it. He moans at the feeling of warm texture of the mouth taking more and more of his cock in. He isnt processing that the last time he used the toy, it hadnt felt like this. He was lost in his pleasure and imagination. <br />
<br />
Dan frowned as he started to feel something entering his mouth. He tried to spit it out or push it out, but it wouldn&#39;t budge. He woke up when the pressure went into his throat. He didnt gag and could still breath, but he did feel something in his mouth filling him up. Dan was still half asleep and thought he was dreaming at first. <br />
<br />
Jace kept pushing his cock into the mouth toy until he was fully inside. He wouldn&#39;t do this to the real Kat, they havent gone that deep yet. But Jace could dream and imagine all he wants. His toys are perfect for those fantasies. He stayed in place to catch his breath and enjoy how the toy hugged his cock. <br />
<br />
Dan couldn&#39;t close his mouth as some tears started to fall and he woke up more. Whatever was in his mouth stayed in place deep in his throat. He started to remember the spell Kat had done and its just been activated. Dan was scared unaware of what was happening exactly. <br />
<br />
After a moment, Jace started to move the toy in and out. Slow at first and sped up at random times. Even mashing his balls into the lips as he imagined Kat face and how it would look stuffed with his cock. That image aroused him more. <br />
<br />
Dan felt the things start moving and even started to taste something he hadnt noticed at first. Something minty mixed with something salty. Dan couldn&#39;t even make a proper sound with something his mouth. He felt as the thing would go slow then fast, soft then hard, and even mashing into his lips. Dan whined around it. <br />
<br />
Jace kept going until he felt his climax getting closer. So his thrusts became even more harsh as he chased his release. Jace still imaging Kat face and moaned. He held the toy tight against his crotch as he finally cummed. He was built up from Kat teasing. He panted and kept it in place. Now that he had cum, he was falling asleep. He had been up late the night before so he was tired. He didnt even have the time of mental capacity to remove his toy as he fell asleep. <br />
<br />
Dan gagged a bit and groaned as the motion became more relentless. He gripped his pillow and hoped it would stop soon. His wish came true as he tasted something thing shoot down his throat and into his stomach. Dan could only swallow and cry as he finally recognized what he was tasting. He wanted the thing out of his mouth. But instead of that, the thing remained where it was. Eventually Dan fell asleep, cockwarming Jace cock in their sleep. <br />
<br />
Randomly through out the night, Jace would harden and cum into his toy from wet dreams. Dan swallowed it all in his sleep. Even when Jace turned his body and the fleshlight was between the bed and Jace body, Dan had no choice even if it meant waking up to swallow again. The night felt long to Dan, while Jace slept peacefully. </p>
