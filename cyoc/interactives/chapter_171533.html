<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brick slid back into his jar shrinking and becoming incorporeal as he went. He wanted to scream but couldn&#39;t bring himself to fearing he may disturb his master.  Brick watched Jared return to normal size, become magically cleaned up, and tucked into his covers. Brick&#39;s heart leapt with joy as he saw a smile cross his master&#39;s face and then Brick was back in his jar and the lid magically sealed itself so he could &quot;recharge&quot; but unfortunately, that also meant the time warp was activated and Brick had a literal eternity between each breath his slumbering master takes.<br />
<br />
This time was different however. Brick had proven that he has powers, and although confined, should be able to use them how he see&#39;s fit within the jar... Possibly to make the jar less jar-like. He began by shrinking down to the size of a grain of sand and suddenly had a vast wealth of space to work with.<br />
<br />
Drawing inspiration from movies, places, and things he&#39;d seen or imagined he began creating his own eco-scape levels including a beach, forest, and mountain. He found that he could include creatures and on each and soon decided to shrink down even smaller to make the worlds truly expansive. Next he added a level for a city and populated it as a scale model of his home town, which was a vague enough wish that even the things he didn&#39;t know popped in correctly. At this point he realized he was running out of cool ideas, and his home town probably isn&#39;t all that cool to begin with so he did what he knew how to do, wished for a computer that would work like he was connected to the internet...<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long (in Jared&#39;s time) that Brick had learned to multiply himself to do multiple things at once. Initially this was to to try every dialog option in the RPG he was playing but it soon expanded exponentially to play every game simultaneously, then he wanted to try playing with and against himself, then he thought it would be funny to have a version of him learn another language to cuss himself out in... but why stop there? <br />
<br />
He learned history, language, physics, biology, politics, psychology and every other skill he could think of. His hometown was soon filled with duplicates made to look and play the part with tiny cars, and tiny lives. Families would take vacations to the other biomes which now included Paris, Las Vegas and Disney World and many more. Perceiving existence from all perspectives of every interaction made him a god.<br />
<br />
He was the hermit who built the log cabin in the forest and spent his afternoon&#39;s fishing on the lake. He was the man teaching his son to hunt and the boy who didn&#39;t want to hurt anything, he was the young woman learning to sew from her grandma and the grandmother teaching her slow witted granddaughter... <br />
<br />
Millenia passed, buildings were torn down, erected, and torn down again. Population grew and shrank. Brick had experienced death countless times over in all forms, accidents, illness, murder. He released several plagues on the lands decimating the population just for funsies... but he eventually magically restored everything...  most notable were zombies, bloodthirsty werewolves, vampires, and a disease that turned people completely into chickens within 2 hours of the first symptoms... the chickening actually caused the most panic.<br />
<br />
Brick also created celestial objects just to see if it would break the jar, a black hole, a star, an entire galaxy. Because he could, he rammed the black hole into the side of the jar to see if that could tip it over, the jar was unphased and the black hole disappeared. He attacked the lid with extra vigor, trying to dent it or unscrew it, but he was truly trapped. Well, as trapped as one could be in an infinite universe that bows to your every whim.<br />
<br />
After playing with the celestial objects Brick went back to his mini society and began testing new regimes like making it impossible to lie, or removing the concept of marriage, just to see what would happen. He was busy experimenting with a world that fostered and supported human genetic engineering when the lid suddenly opened and Jared was there.<br />
<br />
Immediately Brick was outside and looking upon Jared with an understanding only a god could possess. &quot;What is your bidding master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re different again.&quot; Jared commented sounding scared.<br />
<br />
Brick conjured a full length mirror to examine himself in and noticed the ethereal part of his lower half was now a black void with nebulae and galaxies swirling within it, his torso had grown to Herculean proportions, his eyes were white and radiating light. &quot;I believe I have ascended, I have borne witness to the rise and fall of empires, seen the birth and death of galaxies, brought death and destruction to the lands, and experienced countless lives and a million times as many lifetimes.&quot; Brick conjured an image of his long forgotten form and took it as his own, legs and all. &quot;Is this form less disconcerting master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so...&quot; Jared said shakily, unsure if his bully is more comforting than a seemingly trans dimensional, laser eyed muscle half man...<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, in what way can I make your wishes come true?&quot; Brick asked earnestly curious, nothing Jared could ask for would ever come close to the power Brick had and to top it off Brick was immortal! A request for wealth, power, good looks or sex was all nothing compared to controlling the universe with your mind and being able to remember countless lifetime&#39;s of information at the same time. Brick genuinely wanted to know if Jared could make himself happy with wishes and how many it would take. He could easily twist each wish to destroy Jared but he didn&#39;t want to, instead he would grant each wish as intended and see where it leads.</p>
