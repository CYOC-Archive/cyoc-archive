<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve was thankful that he’d invested in a pair of nice speakers in addition to his headset.  With his ears now on top of his head, he had no idea how he’d manage to communicate if he was relying on his headset for both hearing and speaking.  But with his sound already routed through the speakers, Steve draped the headset across his neck, then moved the mic up to his mouth.<br />
<br />
His eyes scanned over the Riscord app.  He couldn’t read anything on the screen anymore, but he still recognized all of the icons just fine.  He knew that none of his gamer buds would be of much use here, not that he would want to get any of them involved in this anyways, so he opened up the one server where the app might be appreciated: Xandal’s Birthing Bin.<br />
<br />
As the name implied, Xandal’s birthing bin was a small server focused on furry pregnancy and birth art that was run by Steve’s good friend Xandal.  Xandal, for his part, lived nearby and was someone that Steve trusted – not that Xandal was his real name, but the two had met online and Steve had just always called him that, even in real life.  <br />
<br />
There were a few other people on the server who also lived within driving distance of Steve’s apartment, but when Steve saw Xandal’s avatar sitting in voice chat, a relieving warmth spread out from the area beneath his breasts.  As much as the other people on this server could help him, a lot of them were… creepy.<br />
<br />
Steve shook his head – he’d never thought of any of them that way before.  Everyone on this server was a friend who he shared porn and played video games with.  He liked talking to them and didn’t care what they looked like in real life.  But something inside of him now felt repulsed by the fact that they were all… fat, or skinny or just… well, Steve had met a lot of them in real life before, and only Xandal was physically fit.<br />
<br />
“Hrnnn…” Steve tried to push the thought out of his mind, but no matter how hard he tried, there was something very comforting about talking to someone with Xandal’s… physical appearance.  Previously, the dudes on this Riscord server had all been his bros that he just hung out with because they were cool.  But now, he felt… unsafe to be around them.  Except, of course, for Xandal.  Every time Steve thought of Xandal, there was the faint feeling of ghostly arms wrapping around his back that made him feel like nothing bad could happen to him – almost like when Leon had…<br />
<br />
Steve hopped into the channel and tried to put on the deepest, most manly sounding voice that he could, but what ended coming out was the sniffling half sobs of a scared skunk girl, “Xandal… *sniffle*... I need you to come over to my… *sniffle* apartment right now.”<br />
<br />
“Steve?” came a bewildered reply, “are you crying dude?  And what’s up with your voice?”<br />
<br />
“I… Xandal please just come over and I’ll... *sniffle* explain!”<br />
<br />
A laugh came through the speakers, passed through Steve’s ears, then pierced straight into his heart – how could Xandal laugh at him, how could Xandal not take him seriously?  Steve didn’t have time to ponder that before Xandal spoke again, “come on dude, did you put your girlfriend on?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Steve pleaded, “Xandal, I…”<br />
<br />
Steve’s sniffling response was cut off by a blade of sarcasm that cut through the Riscord channel, “ok, ‘Steve’, is this some sort of invitation to a threesome?”<br />
<br />
“No! Xandal… *sniffle*… listen do you… do you remember that old story about an app that could change reality?  The one where the guy was changing everyone into pregnant anthros…”<br />
<br />
“Ya?”<br />
<br />
“Xandal… *sniffle*… its… its real.  Or kind of, ok?  It doesn’t work like in that story.  Reality changes but it doesn’t.  And I…”<br />
<br />
Xandal’s tone shifted as a kernel of curiosity burrowed into his voice, “and you?”<br />
<br />
“I…” Steve knew what he should say – that he had changed himself into a pregnant anthro skunk, that his new body was so stupid that he couldn’t read a goddamned thing on the phone, that he needed help, and that Xandal was now his only hope – but as Steve tried to process the whirlpool of emotions surrounding his currently expectant circumstances, a lance of fire shot down his spine.<br />
<br />
Just as had happened many times before, the birthing center of Steve’s brain had sent an electric impulse down into his stomach.  The impulse passed through the muscles lining his womb, then continued down through his cervix and opened every synapse along the walls of his vagina.  The relative peace that Steve had been blessed with vanished as every muscle from his cunt to his ovaries went into overdrive, painfully slamming the dragon’s snout down into his cervix.<br />
<br />
Fire, pain, and unimaginable pressure consumed Steve’s mind as another false contraction forced his body into an involuntary practice run for the labor that was rapidly approaching.  The brief pause that Steve had taken to deal with the emotional burden that his body had imposed on him turned into a cacophony of pain as Steve cried out, “nnnggghhh… oh… oh god!  Xandal… I… aarrrhhh…! I…”<br />
<br />
“Steve?” Xandal still wasn’t sure to make of what he was hearing on Riscord, but agony seemed to ooze from the cries of what increasingly sounded like a legitimately expectant mother on the other end of the voice chat.  “Steve are you really…?  You want me to come over?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a fal-aaaugggh…” Steve panted as the word choked in the back of his throat.  “fal-nnnrggghh…” once again, Steve choked on the word.  Gripping his belly as tightly as he could, Steve tried to steady his breathing against the storm that raged inside of his belly.  Eyes closed; he made one last effort: “it’s a false contrac-aaaahhhnnnn…  I… god ple-ssssrrrrgggnnn… plea-aaahhhh… please Xandal… please come ov-aaaahhhhh!”</p>
