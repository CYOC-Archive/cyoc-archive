<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day proved to be exhausting, thanks to the myriad amount of prep work that had to be conducted. Tissue samples had to be taken for both Alex and Susie in order to start programming the genetic modifications; extensive measurements were needed to get the ultimate proportions exactly right; hormone and chemical levels had to be determined and analyzed; and with the extra mental conditioning that had been requested, both women needed a series of brain scans to begin preparing for what would ultimately be the most delicate part of the whole procedure.<br />
<br />
After the wrap-up to all these tests and samples, al-Zawahi once again sat down with both of them, explaining how the rest of the process would go. It would take a bit longer than usual, both to modify the usual templates they used for creating a Dorse, and more importantly, for the work of installing the appropriate cybernetics. These implants would need to go in first, and the sooner the better - the longer they had before the final Queen&#39;s Stallion procedure, the better the chances of catching any issues and correcting them before Susie became a biological clusterfuck. The future Dorse was honestly a little surprised - for a company that implemented such radical and arguably grotesque changes to their clients, they were extraordinarily concerned with the safety and welfare of those they worked on.<br />
<br />
While great care had to be taken, Alex was ponying up some major cash to expedite things - thus they were scheduled for the first surgey to install the cybernetics one week later. It would prove to be the longest week of anticipation in Susie&#39;s entire life; with every passing day she was more and more giddy, more and more lost in fantasizing about how incredible it would be once the implants were installed and their mind link was established. She had always striven to be an obedient and submissive lover to her adoring wife - but now? Now she would have no choice. Now she would be robbed, at least partially, of her free will, of her ability to resist her beloved&#39;s commands. The thought had her wet almost for the entire week straight - certainly for most of the hours actually leading up to the operation.<br />
<br />
Finally, the day came, both women returning to the lab for their final preparations. Heads shaved on one side each to allow access to the brain, pre-surgery supplements given that would assist their bodies in accepting the new artificial components. They were able to enjoy one last meal together before being carted off to different operating rooms. Deep down, perhaps Susie felt some trepidation at the irreversible path she was about to go down... but as she was brought into the OR and the sedative entered her system, she felt a new wave of reassurance. She would never regret this - and she couldn&#39;t wait to truly become helpless before the mercy of her soulmate.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
There was a general sense of foginess when Susie finally opened her eyes. Awareness was slow to return, coming at a leisurely pace. The blurs over her slowly became shapes, figures, people; the white emptiness of her surroundings took their sweet time morphing into a hospital room. The next thing that followed the return of her sight was awareness of a dull pain in the right side of her head - she reached up after what felt like hours to touch it, only for her hand to be gently stopped by the grasp of a warm, delicate set of fingers. She looked up to find Dr. al-Zawahi, smiling down at her in a set of hospital scrubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, dear. The pain will pass; need to be very ginger until then.&quot; She did, however, help Susie to satisfy her curiousity by carefully bringing the woman&#39;s hand up, letting her fingers brush against the shaved skin until she found a small patch of metal and polymer. &quot;That&#39;s the dataport, in case we need physical access. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll have options to cover it up.&quot; She guided Susie&#39;s hand back down to her side, turning to look over her shoulder. &quot;She&#39;s ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
Susie&#39;s heart leaped as she saw Alex walking towards her, still donned in a hospital gown and leaning on an IV stand. &quot;Hey there, gorgeous,&quot; she said with a faint smile, leaning in to kiss her wife once she was at the other woman&#39;s bedside. &quot;How&#39;re you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; Susie replied, simply and quietly. &quot;Real weird. But happy to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your brain adjusting to havng its processing shunted through the implant,&quot; the doctor explained as she grabbed a couple of cables and inserted ends into each of the two women&#39;s dataports. &quot;We&#39;ve already run some diagnostics - now we just need to do a few tests, to make sure that there hasn&#39;t been any serious damage to sensory processing or higher functions.&quot; Susie and Alex both complied as the doctor started running them through a series of basic exercises, carefully monitoring the results and taking notes on their responses as she tested out different senses. Smell, touch, feel, sight, hearing, plus a battery of historical and mathematical questions - and a few questions about personal details they had shared, in order to verify the integrity of their memories. <br />
<br />
The results seemed to please al-Zawahi. &quot;Alright, everything is looking good so far. If you&#39;d like, we can proceed with testing some of the condi-&quot; Before she could even finish, she found herself pausing at the sight of Alex sticking two fingers under Susie&#39;s gown, straight to the woman&#39;s groin. &quot;-tioning. Right.&quot; She sighed, but still smiled. &quot;Alright, first up, the alterations to your nervous system to prevent unpermitted sexual release. You should be unable to reach orgasm until Alex explicitly allows it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Susie nodded, but she was already going insane. Her wife knew exactly how to touch her to drive her wild, and soon she was starting to thrash on the bed, forcing a nurse to restrain her. Every second of ministration by Alex was torture, the fire growing... but god, no explosion. She was soon desperate, writhing and crying out, begging to be allowed to enjoy climax - but the pressure only continued to build. It was a living nightmare, and within her bucking shell of orgasmic denial, Susie was certain that she had never in her life been happier than she was right at this moment.</p>
