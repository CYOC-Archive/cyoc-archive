<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa Stovall came in to check on her daughter. Julie was already wearing her nightgown and in bed, but the light was still on and she was laying in such a way that she could see her mother come into the room.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Melissa Stovall said, while sitting on the bed next to her daughter.<br />
&quot;Eric thinks so too,&quot; said Julie, before telling her mother about their internet chat.<br />
&quot;<i>Jewel of my love</i>?&quot; said Melissa with a smile, to which Julie&#39;s only response was to blush.<br />
&quot;Eric might need a few romance lessons but believe me, I am truly happy for you honey. When I was a normal human, it took me ten years to figure out your father was my soul mate. If I only knew then what I know now. I can&#39;t help thinking about all the extra time we could of had together if only I was as smart as you, Eric, or your father,&quot; said her mother.<br />
&quot;But dad&#39;s always said he would have waited, no matter how long it took, and you two are together now,&quot; Julie reminded her.<br />
&quot;All the more reason for me to love him. But even weres can have regrets. Now then, what did you want to talk about?&quot; asked her mother, giving her daughter both a more serious look and tone of voice.<br />
&quot;Well, since me, you, and dad talked last about sex and romance; I&#39;ve made sure I have my were-mermaid birth control pills always available and are taking them daily like I&#39;m supposed to. Since we just recently renewed it for another month, I&#39;ve still got about three weeks left in the current bottle, and I&#39;ve done plenty of serious research,&quot; began Julie, looking at her intently. &quot;But no matter how much I look, there are two questions that I still can&#39;t find a definitive answer to.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first of all, when the time comes, will it hurt?&quot; asked Julie. &quot;Not every source I&#39;ve checked agrees that it will, let alone to what degree,&quot; she added, worried about the big moment.<br />
Melissa Stovall took a good look at her daughter, trying her best to keep from crying, as she spoke in a matter of fact tone. &quot;Fear, and the perception of how you look at a situation, can be contributing factors. You&#39;re a very smart girl and we&#39;re having this conversation now because you can&#39;t find the answers you need and are obviously worried, which is perfectly normal,&quot; she said, while trying to give Julie a reassuring smile. &quot;A girl&#39;s sexual introduction into womanhood is one of the major milestone&#39;s within a woman&#39;s life. Remember how panicky you got during your first period? Even after I took you to the doctor, it still took you another day or so to come to terms with it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom, that <i>was</i> scary,&quot; said Julie, somewhat defensively.<br />
&quot;And understandably so. My first period wasn&#39;t much fun either. Now then, if you mean will there be any physical pain when you and Eric are physically united, I have to be totally honest with you and admit that it will hurt, to a point,&quot; to which her daughter&#39;s response was a sharp intake of breath.<br />
&quot;You see, every girl is different, weres and normals alike; and so all their hymens are different too,&quot; began her mother, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Despite past beliefs, a hymen doesn&#39;t completely block the opening to your vagina. It is physically attached to your... interior, but only restricts the access to some extent. Otherwise, you&#39;d never be able to urinate or have your period. Understand?&quot;<br />
Julie thought about that for a moment, and then simply nodded her head in agreement.<br />
&quot;Some physical activities, like bicycle riding, sports, and horseback riding, do have an effect on a girl&#39;s hymen too. So some hymens are not as complete as others when the big moment comes.&quot;<br />
Then Melissa Stovall lowered her head and whispered in her daughter&#39;s ear, &quot;But I can also tell you, from personal experience, that it only hurts for a couple of moments during the very first time. After that, sex can be very pleasurable with the right person, especially if done right.&quot;<br />
Julie turned her head to look at her mother and whispered, &quot;I know Eric is the right person, but how will I know if we&#39;re doing it right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Trust me. You <i>will</i> know,&quot; Melissa replied with a smile, before kissing her daughter&#39;s forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, speaking as someone with past experience, would you like me to share a few tips with you?&quot; mother asked daughter, while keeping her head next to Julie and her voice low.<br />
Julie eagerly nodded her head and said, &quot;Yes. Please.&quot;<br />
&quot;Whenever and wherever it does happen, the key words to your very first time are slow and gentle,&quot; began Melissa. &quot;Towards the end, you both will feel a great... urgency to finish, but start off slow and gentle. It will help if somehow you can manage to be on top for the first time. At least when you actually start to... unite your bodies,&quot; said her mother, finding it difficult to stay unemotional during their conversation. &quot;Then you can control the pace of Eric&#39;s... entry into manhood to help lessen at least your fear and perception, if not the actual physical pain factor. But remember, this will be the first time for both of you,&quot; her mom pointed out. &quot;Eric will have his own worries and concerns at that time too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
&quot;You mean besides the fact he will be experiencing his first transformation into a were-merman immediately afterward? Eric will be worried about how he&#39;s treating you, whether or not he&#39;s doing his part right, whether or not you&#39;re happy, and all kinds of other things from a guy&#39;s perspective.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is there anything I can do to... help with that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides taking it slow and gentle? Tell Eric how you feel along the way. Encourage him on the positive things that bring you both pleasure, and be patient while carefully explaining if something&#39;s wrong so you both can figure out how to correct it, together.&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a lot to learn about all of this, isn&#39;t there?&quot; realized Julie.<br />
&quot;For both of you,&quot; agreed her mother. &quot;Perhaps if you can find a subtle way to... hint to Eric to ask his father for advice, if he hasn&#39;t already.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; promised Julie. &quot;But you heard dad. Besides knowing how I feel about Eric, and how he feels about me, seeing Eric&#39;s eyes change color means we&#39;re not only truly each other&#39;s soul mate, but we&#39;re destined to be together.&quot; <i><b>FOREVER!</b></i> she thought happily.<br />
&quot;I know dear, and I&#39;m happy for you both,&quot; said her mother with a smile, before kissing Julie on the forehead again. <i>You may be a very smart 14 year old girl, but you&#39;re still a 14 year old girl,</i> thought Melissa, while staring at her daughter again. <i>It may be different for weres, but you&#39;re still my baby.</i> <br />
<br />
Then she went back to her sitting position on the bed and asked, &quot;What was your other question?&quot;<br />
&quot;How will I know when the <i>right</i> time is?&quot;<br />
Mother looked at daughter and admitted, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s a lot more complicated, and part of it&#39;s going to depend on Eric too.&quot;<br />
&quot;My dreams are starting to skew all over the place now when I think about it,&quot; revealed Julie. &quot;I&#39;d be surprised if either of us even makes it to our <i>15th</i> birthdays next year. Eric&#39;s parents were hoping we&#39;d make it to our <i>16th</i> birthdays, and dad&#39;s been back and forth all over the calendar on this.&quot;<br />
Considering what her husband told her privately earlier about not knowing how long Eric would last, since he was still a normal human at the moment, Melissa was trying to decide what to say to her daughter when Martin Stovall walked into the bedroom.<br />
&quot;Hey, how are my wonderful ladies doing?&quot; he asked with a smile.<br />
&quot;We were in the middle of—&quot; Melissa started to say, when her husband&#39;s cellphone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who could it be at this hour?&quot; he asked, concerned, while taking it out of his pants&#39; pocket. A quick look at the display screen, and Martin said, &quot;Hello Fred. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
Julie started to whisper, &quot;Why is Uncle Fred—&quot;, when her father exclaimed, &quot;WHAT? Is she all right?&quot;<br />
Unfortunately, a were-mer&#39;s hearing is not as acute as some species, so the ladies had to wait until Martin finished his phone call. But when he said, &quot;Okay. Do what you can. I&#39;ll be there by tomorrow night,&quot; they knew something wasn&#39;t right.<br />
&quot;Everything okay?&quot; asked Melissa, as she saw her husband&#39;s face turn pale.<br />
&quot;Sometimes I wonder about that woman,&quot; was all he said, and both ladies instantly knew Martin was referring to his mother.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with Grandma?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
&quot;She&#39;s over 200 as a were-mermaid, which barely puts her into her 40s if she was a normal human, and she decided to go rollerblading. Fred says she had an accident and broke her leg. Didn&#39;t know about it until she missed her dinner date with his family and he went looking for her. He helped her get to the hospital and they&#39;re in the emergency room now. The doctor will probably keep her there overnight for observation before sending Grandma home. She&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Martin reassured his daughter, &quot;but Grandma&#39;s leg will be in a cast for at least a few days, and Fred wants me to come down and help out, at least over the weekend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does that mean—&quot; began Julie, to which Melissa quickly turned to her daughter and put a finger over her own mouth, indicating Julie should be quiet for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I contact the deputy mayor and a couple of other people, I&#39;ll drive down to California first thing in the morning,&quot; he revealed, never noticing the gesture between mother and daughter. &quot;Can you and Julie come too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie has school and I have that major computer overhaul Friday,&quot; Melissa reminded him, not mentioning that the computer overhaul was at the high school because Friday was actually a Teachers In Service Day for the school district.<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Martin, too worried about his mother to realize the mistake. &quot;You know those meetings we mentioned having tomorrow? Do you think you can handle mine too?&quot;<br />
Melissa recalled that Martin was going to talk to William Anderson, while she talked to Martha Anderson, letting Eric&#39;s parents know about their children being destined soul mates, which would lead to Eric becoming a were-merman sooner than anyone expected, although exactly when remained unknown.<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll take care of it,&quot; promised his wife, but Julie saw that her mother had one hand behind her back and her fingers crossed! &quot;Now you better go on to our room and start taking care of things. I&#39;ll finish up in here and be there to help as soon as I can.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks dear,&quot; replied Martin Stovall, giving his wife a quick kiss before going to their bedroom.<br />
<br />
After Melissa Stovall heard the bedroom door close, she turned to look at her daughter as a confused Julie asked, &quot;Mom, what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fate dear,&quot; replied Melissa, as she hugged her daughter. &quot;Fate. Kismet. Destiny. Whatever you care to call it. I certainly didn&#39;t want Grandma to get hurt in the process, but there is no way I&#39;m going to see my daughter have to wait ten years to know her true love and happiness.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean—&quot; realized Julie, as her eyes turned a brighter shade of sea blue as she began to smile.<br />
&quot;Friday starts a three day weekend for you kids. If all goes well, by the time I come home from work, there will be a new were-merman in Moon Lake and the Jewel Of His Love will be <b>very</b> happy,&quot; she said, still hugging her daughter and no longer able to keep herself from crying.<br />
