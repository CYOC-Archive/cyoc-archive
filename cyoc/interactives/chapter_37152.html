<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At one side he felt the idea very compelling but on the other side it made Mark uncomfortable. Without wanting it he felt a dizziness overcome him and he fainted. His body nearly hit the smaller Mary. <br />
<br />
“Mark! Are you alright?” she shrieked, she thought quickly and began to inhale making her bigger. Soon she was her relative normal size and tried get the fainted Mark up. <br />
<br />
However, she couldn’t move him a inch. She realized why, she was made from rubber now and had become too light. She wondered what to do. <br />
Suddenly a shaft of sunlight entered the room and let the vials shimmer. <br />
<br />
“What one should I take?” she wondered , there were so many different ones . <br />
<br />
She decided to go with the vial with the skunk pictured on it, she giggled at the thought of him being a rubber skunk. <br />
She opened Mark’s mouth and carefully let the light-blue liquid slide down his throat. <br />
<br />
At first she didn’t see anything happen but then she saw how the hairs on his arms fell off and began to have a unnatural shine. His skin began to darken as it began to look less and less organic. <br />
<br />
On his face the changes were the most drastic at first. His rubber nose began to reshape itself and connected with his mouth. His nose was triangle shaped now and had pushed out slightly, his mouth became a obvious jaw. <br />
<br />
Curious as she was she poked his nose and felt how easy she could push it inwards. <br />
<br />
It was then that she noticed something else happening, when his ears were reshaping he began to shrink too. At first she thought it was because she pushed the nose but he kept shrinking, although very slowly. <br />
<br />
As the white began to appear on his face she noticed his head became rounder and younger looking. His clothes began slowly to consume him as the changes continued.<br />
<br />
One finger began to shrink and vanished in his hand where the others became a bit broader. With a soft pop pads appeared on his hands. <br />
Suddenly Mary looked confused as Mark began to rise on his own. <br />
<br />
However, when she saw how a large bulb began to form at his backside it became clear what was happening. <br />
<br />
When mary removed his pants to release the huge rubbery tail she noticed he had become genderless, where his manhood was supposed to be was now only shimmering skin. <br />
<br />
He still was getting younger, fifteen became fourteen, fourteen went by and thirteen came. Twelve was already there as eleven took it’s place.  She had took all his clothes and held him in her rubbery arms.  Ten became as she began to stroke his belly and began to play with his navel. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t deny he did look insanely cute. He stopped getting smaller and younger when he looked to be around seven years old. <br />
“Wake up Mark” she whispered in his big round ears that had snuck to the top of his head. When she repeated it a couple of times he began to squirm. <br />
<br />
With her one hand she took the vial and looked closer. <br />
“Skunk kid” was under the picture. That explained a lot to her. <br />
She began to rub his chest and belly and Mark began to open his eyes. He felt really good. He began to stretch his whole body and he giggled when she started to tickle him. <br />
<br />
“Haha, stop it-stop it” he rubbery legs and arms bounced back and forth as they hit her without doing any pain. <br />
<br />
When she stopped he realized how high his voice was and that he was held by Mary. And then he remembered why he had fainted. And after all those thoughts he noticed his own black skin. <br />
<br />
“Hey, wha-what happened to me” he began to panick slightly. He wanted out of her arms but she firmed her grip and even slightly squeezed him. <br />
“Shh, relax. I took one of those vials because you were too heavy to pick up. And it seems you have become a adorable little skunk” <br />
<br />
He began to relax and when she noticed that she planted his head between her huge breasts and hugged him. The feeling of stroking rubber was unbelievable. <br />
<br />
Even if he didn’t had any sexual equipment anymore it felt so incredible good he suddenly didn’t complain anymore to be made from rubber.</p>
