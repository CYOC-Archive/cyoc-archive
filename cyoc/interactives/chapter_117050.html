<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was mortified. How was she supposed to handle all of this? She was a total freak now and there were still more changes to come.<br />
She gritted her teeth. That was all Kyle Perkin&#39;s fault! Once she&#39;d see him, she&#39;d definitely make him pay for that. Even if she wouldn&#39;t be able to ever turn normal again, she&#39;d still try to get her revenge on that bastard. That would probably be the only thing then to make her feel a little better at least. Well, at least she hoped that it would make her feel better.<br />
She lowered her arms again and looked back at the teacher, her trying to somehow still try to act as normal as possible whilst she took deep breaths. Don&#39;t worry, she thought in order to calm herself down, Everyone thinks of you as normal to look like that, Jen... <br />
Though, her gaze then wandered to her arms again and she noticed something odd. Well, more odd than the fact that they were covered in dark brown fur. Did they always manage to reach over the table&#39;s edge that much? She knew that she managed to that with the tips of her fingers when she stretched, but by just sitting normally, she was pretty sure that she didn&#39;t manage to reach over it with her whole hand by just having them placed on the table normally.<br />
And that was when she was now pretty sure, another change was definitely to come now and she was quick to raise her hand and ask the teacher if she could go to the restroom really quick whilst she felt even more mortified when everyone looked at her. Once she got the allowance to go there, she got up as fast as possible and then left the classroom. When she was in the hallway, Jen looked down at her body and noticed almost right away that her shirt seemed to be a little shorter than before. Did that mean she was increasing in height? She bit her lip and made a run to the restroom.<br />
When she arrived there, Jen placed her hands on the edge of the sink and squinted her eyes shut tightly. Damn it, now she even felt pain whenever she seemed to increase in height. <br />
Not only that, but she also felt her clothes tightening the taller she became and soon enough, her shirt barely managed to cover up her breasts and her the straps of her bra seemed to be tearing into her skin as her shoulders also began to broaden. Her pants were so tight, it hurt whenever she tried to moved her legs and when she turned around, she saw half of her hairy ass being able to seen by then and she found herself turning red out of complete embarressment, though, it wasn&#39;t able to be seen thanks to her fur.<br />
&quot;Calm down, Jen... Calm down. You&#39;re just taller and... hairy..&quot;, she tried to first calm herself down before she then felt another rush of pain going through her and started to grow once more. Now neither her shirt managed to still cover up her boobs nor were her pants still able to cover up her ass. She was now pretty much just standing there in her underwear and even there she could see that her bra wouldn&#39;t be able to hold on any longer because the more her shoulders broadened due to the change, the straps of it began to tear into her skin. <br />
With wide eyes, the now at least 8 feet or so tall Jennifer tried to loosen the straps as best as she could, her letting out a sigh of relief as she managed to do so. Then she looked back at her reflection and swallowed.<br />
Great, now was she not only covered in fur, but also taller than any guy at this school. And the only clothes that still managed to fit her were her bra, panties, socks and shoes. That was just horrible...<br />
Jennifer bit her lip harshly and took off her way too small pants and shirt as she then still tried to cover herself somehow up with them. There was no way she could stay in school today anymore. Not when she looked like that and especially not in her underwear. <br />
Just when she was about to turn and try to sneak out the restroom&#39;s door somehow though, she suddenly tripped when she felt a painful sensation in her feet and fell onto the ground. &quot;What the..?&quot;, her eyes widened as she sat up to take a look at what other change was ocurring and was shocked to see her small and still slender feet now change to fit her tall body as her shoes began to feel tigther and tighter on them before she soon enough happened to tear a hole into them so that her toes could poke out. But her feet weren&#39;t done growing yet. She watched in horror as they looked more like the feet of a male and was even more terrified to see her toes fusing together until there were only three thick blocks left on each fot. She was so shocked by the change at her feet, she failed to notice that the same changes were happening to her hands.<br />
Jen took notice of them though when she stood up quickly as tears filled her eyes and was just about to throw the door opening. Now she couldn&#39;t hold in a scream of pure terror anymore before she then threw the door open and ran out the school crying furiously, her wanting nothing else than to just get home now...</p>
