<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christina woke covered in the muck.  It felt warm and soothing on her skin.  She felt drowsy, and began to drift back to sleep when she heard the witch calling to her. Christina rose out of the muck, but if felt too cool outside of the mud.  She quickly slid back into the warm mud, and began to drift through it towards the witch.<br />
<br />
The witch had set up a trough at the edge of her pen, and was filling it with all kinds of refuse.  The scraps of food looked disgusting, but smelled wonderful for some reason.  Christina felt her mouth water in spite of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know you must be hungry, so very hungry.  Now be good, my little pet, and eat up, &quot; said the witch.  She brought the remains of an apple right in front of Christina&#39;s face.  Christina could no longer contain her hunger, and gobbled the food up out of the witch&#39;s hand.  She rapidly devoured it, but it only seemed to make her more hungry.  She began to greedily eat all of the food in the trough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good, &quot; said the witch soothingly.  &quot;Soon you will be big and strong. Eat and grow, my little pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina didn&#39;t like the sound of that.  The witch was planning something, and she doubted it was anything good.  But right now, she was just so hungry  all she could concentrate on was filling her belly.  Christina continued to eat, even after the witch left.  She decided to try to escape after she had a full stomach.  But after she was finished eating, she felt incredibly sleepy.  She found herself deep asleep in the mud before she had made it halfway across the pen.<br />
<br />
And this was how it continued for several days. Christina was always sleepy and tired, only having enough energy to drag herself through the mud to eat.  She would then rapidly drift back to sleep, only awakening for another meal.<br />
<br />
Until one day, the witch came to her pen without food.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come, my little pet.  Come to me.  It is time. I want to see how big you have gotten, &quot; said the witch.  <br />
<br />
Christina eyed her lazily.  She was hungry, but also very tired.  If the witch didn&#39;t have food, then she didn&#39;t see the point in moving.  She eyed the witch, and was surprised to see that she looked more tired than usual.  She must have been working hard on something, and whatever it was had taken a toll on her.  <br />
<br />
Maybe now is my chance, thought Christina.  If she is that weak, maybe I can get away.<br />
<br />
She turned in the mud, and rolled her large body.  She tried to stand, but found it difficult to lift her massive weight.  Instead, she crawled through the mud on her hands and feet towards the edge of the pen.  When she reached the edge of the mud pit, she used the incline to help her stand up on her hind legs.  Her bulky weight made her unsteady, and she had to lean against the fence for support.  The witch stood below her, and Christina was surprised at how much smaller the witch looked.  Then she realized it was not  the witch that was smaller, but her that was bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my pet.  You have grown nicely.  You will serve me well, &quot; said the witch happily.<br />
<br />
Christina&#39;s eyes went wide.  &quot;Serve you? &quot; she said in a deep husky voice, marked by several grunts. &quot;Are you going to eat me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch cackled.  &quot;Oh my no!&quot; said the witch.  &quot;That would be such a terrible waste of such powerful magic.  No, you will serve me in other ways.  Here have a look at yourself.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The witch brought forth a mirror, and Christina gasped when she saw her reflection.  She had been so consumed with sleep and hunger that she hadn&#39;t noticed the changes.  She had the face of a pig, but two very large sharp tusks protruded from her lower lip.  She reached up and touched her hair, which was now a spiked mane that extended down her back.  She looked at her hands, which had three thick fingers ending in hooves.  Her skin was covered by a fine short brown fur.  She looked down and saw a massive belly, that caused her to teeter dangerously forward, almost failing to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; she grunted, as she continued to stare at her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I have improved you, my pet.  You see, a witch has many enemies.  And I am afraid magic can only provide so much protection.  Sometimes, a little muscle is needed.  So, I modified my spell a little bit so I could make myself some bodyguards,&quot; said the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am no bodyguard, &quot; grunted Christina, as she dropped the mirror and pointed to her wobbly belly.<br />
<br />
The witch laughed.  &quot;Of course not!  But you will be the mother of my bodyguards.  The Eve to a new species of boar warriors who will serve me loyally. Ah, here comes your Adam now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina turned, and slipped to the ground. She saw a large hybrid pig-man approaching her.  He was not as large a her, but he was much more fit and lean. Christina struggled to stand, but her massive belly made it difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you don&#39;t have to do this, &quot; she pleaded.  &quot;You don&#39;t need to breed me.  Just use your magic to turn more people into pigs!&quot;<br />
<br />
The witched sighed, and looked tired.  &quot;I wish I could.  It is easy to turn people into pigs. And even easier to turn pigs into men. But you - you are something special.  It was exhausting creating you.  It nearly used up all of my magic, and it will take me quite a while to recover.  But you should be honored.  You will be the mother of a new breed of creature, an Eve  to a whole new species.  Your name will be legend, and you will be revered as a Queen among your kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina grunted, and flailed about.  She could not find her footing in the mud, and the small pig-man was rapidly approaching her with lust in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun, my little pet.  I am afraid this is something you will have to do alone.  It is not quite to my taste.  I will bring your afternoon meal a little later.  I am sure you will have worked up quite the appetite.  After all, you will be eating for more than one, &quot; said the witch with a smile, as she walked away.</p>
