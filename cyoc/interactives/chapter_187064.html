<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing that Jeff had finished changing into Carl´s new underwear, Carl stood up and quickly collected both the Jeff-boxers and the masturbation-sock from their respective piles and returned to the computer. “You turned out perfect, Jeff. Just a last thing to do now before I put you on.”<br />
Carl had something planned for a replacement, that hadn´t been a lie. But he had decided on a small connection between the original Jeff and the replacement. He would also add another connection, between Jeff and any other clothes he would get, over the sock. Carl would give them all some kind of tattoo for that. And therefore, he needed both Jeff and the sock on the desk, right next to his old clothes.<br />
Suddenly, Jeff mentally screamed in pain. Something was stabbing him continually in his lips. Focusing his sight inside, he watched in horror as a small needle flow through him, quickly embroidering his name “Jeffrey” with a red thread on the front-inside. When that was finished, the needle switched to the back, while the thread turned white. Just as quickly as before, the needle stitched “Owned by Carl Turner” into his waistband.<br />
At the same time something similar happened to the old sock. It also felt the needle penetrate its skin, adding the same “Owned by Carl Turner” into its top. Because the thread was also white, it wasn´t really visible afterwards, but it had the effect Carl had wanted it to have. Jeff and the sock-twin could hear each other again. Carl let the chronivac enable a chat-program, which would show him their conversations if he wanted to, but right now he had other plans to finish.<br />
Into his own old, grey underwear, the needle also embroidered Jeffrey in red thread, but added his surname Brown and suddenly, Jeff felt the connection to the still lifeless underwear.<br />
When the embroidering was finished in all three pieces of clothing, Carl stood up and put the Jeff-boxers on slowly. “You are really comfortable there, Jeff” he said, enjoying the soft fabric gliding up his legs and into position. With a snap, Carl let Jeff´s waistband close around his waist, giving Jeff a first-row-seat onto his cock and balls. Grinning, Carl started his premade changes for his old underwear, after tossing it over to Jeff´s bed.<br />
As he watched, the underwear started to grow bigger, slowly gaining a more humanoid form. Opposite to how Jeff turned into boxer-shorts, the underwear´s holders split open, growing into more cylindrical shapes to the sides of the growing body, soon to be arms and legs. While the former front-side rose up into a ball-like shape, the former back-side split into the replacement’s ass, cock and balls.<br />
Out of the cylindrical legs grew feet, knees formed in their middle, while similar things happened to the arms, growing in hands and elbows. The ball-shaped head gained features quickly, growing ears and a nose, gaining eyes and a mouth, quickly covering on top with brown hair. The overall grey color had already turned into human skin-color at that point.<br />
With a shudder, the replacement for Jeff, Carl´s former underwear, came alive as the old fabric turned into flesh. The new Jeff opened his eyes, looking down first, then at Carl in shock. “Why am I naked Carl? What have you done?”<br />
Carl laughed at that. “Nothing Jeff. I had fun seeing you change into underwear, but as you see, I also turned you back without wearing you. Don´t worry, I won´t do it again, and your clothes are still on the ground where you shrunk out of them.”<br />
The new Jeff was quickly putting the clothes on. “Okay, thanks for not putting me on. The thought alone is weird.”<br />
The original Jeff was confused by now. Why thought the replacement it was him? Jeff had no idea that Carl had just copied over slightly edited memories to the new Jeff. He remembered everything like Jeff, just not as royal-blue boxers, but simple, grey underwear. To him, he had only been underwear for about five minutes, in which Carl took him to the desk, did something small, then tossed him onto his bed and changed him back. But Carl had made the new Jeff more submissive to him, and Jeff would easily accept what Carl told him. To this Jeff, the chronivac belonged to Carl, and he would never change anything without asking him.<br />
Also, his new tattoo, his own name in bright red ink, spiraled around his cock, but only clearly readable if he was fully erect. But even if he saw it, he would simply ignore it. The tattoo enabled the original Jeff to watch out of the new Jeff´s eyes, even reading his thoughts, but had no way of influencing him.<br />
The embroidered threads each had a function in this. The “Owned by Carl Turner” would connect each of the changed new clothes over the old masturbation sock, giving them the option of talking to each other. The first name would enable a connection between the original and the replacement, but the surname would make it one-way. So, the original would be able to see through the replacement with the surname, but the replacement would not feel the connection, only being the sender of everything.<br />
When the new Jeff had finished putting his clothes back on, he sat down on his bed, looking over at Carl a bit angry. “That wasn´t nice, Carl. I really feared you would keep me as underwear and wear me.”<br />
Carl grinned at him. “I thought about putting you on, but I wanted it to be a prank, and putting you on would have been a bit too much. How does it feel being a part of clothing?”<br />
Jeff thought about it. “Weird. I was unable to move, but could feel everything. I felt helpless as I couldn´t escape you when you lifted me up or have thrown me onto my bed. Not something I want to repeat.”<br />
Carl nodded. “Okay, I won´t change you into clothes again, or something inanimate for that matter. Only if you ask me to do it. I´m sorry that you couldn´t enjoy the little prank.”<br />
The Jeff-boxers cursed at Carl. He would whole-heartily agree with his replacement, only he was the original and still an inanimate part of clothing. And what was worse, Carl was wearing him. But he could do nothing to turn back, could he?</p>
