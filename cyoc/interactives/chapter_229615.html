<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The time difference between Heiya Island and Dino City made following the Year of the Dragon contest rather complicated for those that were there, at least with any sort of live viewing. There were options to watch the events later, as Animalia made sure they were then posted on the internet shortly after. And since Heiya Island was officially part of Japan, many of the restrictions to certain sites and things that were present in North Korea or the People&#39;s Republic of China were not present. It was a case where anyone representing those countries on the island would have to &quot;self-sensor&quot; the material if they wanted to abide by their home country&#39;s laws. Though, for some, it also presented an escape from those sorts of restrictions, as was the case for a small family of Korean Water Deer that had moved to the island.<br />
<br />
For Hyun, things had started as part of a scheme from the North Korean government to provide for an army of Animalian super soldiers that would be able to subsist on less than what the average Human needed, would be stronger than the average Human, would have the reflexes needed to avoid most threats on the battlefield and potentially have the senses and nimbleness to go through minefields without triggering them. It was all part of an idea that, if taken to its conclusion, would enable the end to the division of Korea and the rule from the North, as had been the goal going all the way back to the Korean War. And with the previous American President quickly and easily caving to these sorts of things as part of policies that were clearly aimed at American retreats, Hyun had felt there was an opportunity. <br />
<br />
But with Ling&#39;s uplifting and trying to get other answers from Horizon and the various law enforcement agencies in Lyre/Animalia, Hyun began to get some sense that a lot of the plan was a fool&#39;s errand to begin with. Ling may have accepted certain criticisms Hyun had of the West, but she never showed any real desire to be aggressive. And despite all his attempts at censorship of information to her in Lyre/Animalia, Hyun found that difficult and that in turn only raised questions and debates, both with Ling and with others. And at the same time, Hyun also found himself falling into some of the same traps that had befallen spies and agents before him... he found himself accepting the different ways of life that were there. He also found himself personally caring for Ling and NOT wanting her to be abused or exploited. For even if she wouldn&#39;t have been a super soldier, and Hyun presently suspected that the only Animalians that might willing go to war right now would be Ukrainians defending their country, Hyun was also well aware that his government would ultimately enslave her to get SOMETHING out of a failed investment. That was something that Hyun couldn&#39;t allow... particularly as he began to emotionally fall in love with Ling.<br />
<br />
By that time, the American President his government had manipulated had lost power and the new American President was trying to rework the agreements and support for Japan and South Korea and other Western partners. It killed a lot of the plans that had been there and provided some window and cover for Hyun to then convert and marry Ling... even while confronting another man that had become a Korean Water Deer as well. After all, the situation would represent a case for diplomacy and the cover of being &quot;unable to escape.&quot; Hyun liked that, as it did allow that blossoming love to grow firmer. However, he also noted that the man his government had essentially bullied was still active in leading the opposition to the US government and was also unhinged enough that Hyun also had the sense that things in America would not be safe for the long term, particularly if and when any official statement of &quot;defection&quot; was made, which is ultimately what brought Hyun and Ling to Heiya Island. As the two watched the start of the last races in the Year of the Dragon contest on their television, Hyun let his mind drift back to that...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it here, Hyun,&quot; Ling said to him in what was their apartment.<br />
<br />
Given that North Korea and the US had rather tense relations that went back to the 1950s, even with the previous President&#39;s willingness to make deals, even with autocrats who had no good will to the US, there weren&#39;t many facilities for him that would be official. And given that Lyre/Animalia was a relatively small town in northwestern Nevada, even if such facilities were available in the US, they wouldn&#39;t be available in Lyre/Animalia because of its size. At first, Hyun had simply used a hotel room that was provided, but after his conversion and other things became ever more likely, he&#39;d settled for an apartment, and starting with sort of ambassadorial role to Animalia on the behalf of his government. There were technicalities and an officer of the US State Department often came in for official meetings, but Hyun had also found himself with barely any contact with his country&#39;s orders and things almost stood as a state of abandonment.<br />
<br />
However, the new US government was extremely unpopular and the chaos that followed democracies everywhere seemed to be at a level that presented an even greater risk. Particularly as the man that his government had hoped to bully into allowing for Animalian super soldiers was claiming credit for the Republicans gaining a narrow majority in the US House of Representatives. Hyun was certain that a lot of what was there had little to do with what was being pontificated, but he could see it as a threat... to Ling. For the man making the claims wanted Animalian super soldiers every bit as much as his own government had wanted them, and while Hyun was sure that the US could provide better protection when the official declaration of &quot;defection&quot; was to be made, he seriously doubted the instability of democracy would leave the Americans willing to do so, as his government made a lot of gains during the previous President&#39;s tenure and the previous President also sought to appease any strong man that flattered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Hyun answered, &quot;but things are also chaotic here. This state&#39;s new governor is a loyalist to the former President... the rhetoric and actions of his followers continue to be wild. Everything that I would say represents the core problems with the West. Their chaos and proclivity to violence across the board. And... it&#39;s not safe for you. Not in the long term.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they aren&#39;t going after Animalians,&quot; Ling pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;They will if and when they find that I&#39;m not abiding by the will of their leader, who will effectively cave to the people the Americans &quot;say&quot; are enemies,&quot; Hyun spoke, &quot;and it won&#39;t entirely be as though we&#39;d be going somewhere bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heiya Island?&quot; Ling asked, &quot;but that&#39;s Japan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Hyun answered, &quot;but their democracy is not as unstable as America, and if need be... we could get the options to look at some measure of protection from when things get bad here... and you will be safe. Safe to start a family...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to get Ling to raise her ears in surprise and then smile.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Hyun and Ling watched as the herm Dakotaraptor Dinotopian won the race up Zodiac Mountain for the crown for herms. Neither truly understood the psychological concepts that lead to many converted Animalians taking on that herm gene, but both understood enough about science that the gene was real and did work, no matter how much some tried to twist things. Though, at the same time, that result really wasn&#39;t the biggest thing for the two Korean Water Dear. And to a degree, the broadcast on the Year of the Dragon Contest also wasn&#39;t the biggest thing for them. It was fun to watch, even if it wasn&#39;t entirely what traditional for the celebration of the Lunar New Year, but it wasn&#39;t the most important thing for Hyun or Ling. The most important thing provided a reminder to Hyun by pushing out one leg and catching him in the side.<br />
<br />
Ling blinked when she heard Hyun give a surprised grunt and then turned to look down and see their fawn stretching between them. That made Ling smile, as the fawn was something she dearly wanted, particularly once Hyun accepted that she loved him and became her mate. He may worry more about what his former masters or their Communist Chinese allies may do and the move to Heiya Island came with worries over the growing political chaos in the US as followers of the former president did everything possible to stoke fear and division, while blaming their opposition for the division they, themselves, caused, but that was always something that went over Ling&#39;s head. She was no politician and all she wanted was to be happy and have her mate by her side... so that they may have a family. And looking to the little fawn stretching between them, that only brought a smile to her muzzle.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
January 2023 came quickly... but as Ling made her way through the halls of the Japanese embassy on Heiya Island, there was something she was desperate to share. That thing was presently on a piece of paper that she had clutched in her hands as she was looking for Hyun. The move was relatively easy, largely as there wasn&#39;t much too move from Lyre/Animalia and Hyun noted that with the defection from North Korea to Japan, it was going to be unlikely that he&#39;d get anything that he owned in North Korea back. That was all as good as gone, and he accepted that. And with the move to Heiya Island and the formal defection to Japan... or at least as a place of exile, Ling and Hyun had been able to start on many new things. The representative of the Japanese government did note that the People&#39;s Republic of China did have offices on Heiya Island and it wouldn&#39;t be impossible for their agents to infiltrate the island... but Hyun was determined and made the point that &quot;this was best for Ling&#39;s safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the safety hadn&#39;t been all of it. In December of the previous year, Ling had come into season and two of them had their romantic time together, and now Ling was looking through the Japanese embassy to find her husband to confirm on what they&#39;d been hoping for. He&#39;d gotten a minor job as a clerk that left him shuffling papers on those who came to Heiya Island for conversions or possible cases of immigration to Japan to reside on Heiya Island. A lot of Hyun&#39;s work was supervised, as the Japanese government had every reason to be suspicious of a North Korea... particularly one who was critical of many elements of the West and with North Kora firing rockets over Japan again. But as Hyun showed calmness and tolerance, Ling was sure that their suspicions would change, just as Hyun had dropped his desire to be involved in his home country&#39;s geopolitical games. She found him at a water cooler drinking from a glass and looking quite good in the grey business suit he&#39;d gotten to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hyun!&quot; Ling gave a happy cheer as she leaped into his arms, barely giving him time to set the glass down on top of the water cooler. She hung on his neck for a few moments before nuzzling her muzzle to his and making sure not to accidentally impale herself on his tusks. &quot;I have wonderful news...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful news...&quot; Hyun said slowly, &quot;You mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun set Ling down and she presented the paper she&#39;d been carrying. It was a bit wrinkled now from being pressed into Hyun&#39;s back in the course of the hug, but Ling didn&#39;t care and she was sure that when Hyun read the full report, he would not care either. Ling watched as Hyun read through the medical report. This included the stated hormone levels and included notes from Horizon where things stood for Animalians having both Human and Animal traits, but as Hyun got to the end of the report, the last line brought about a real smile. &quot;That based on the available data, it can be confirmed that Ling Hyun in pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to have a family,&quot; Hyun said slowly after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a new start,&quot; Ling smiled, &quot;and one where you and I will be free...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The line &quot;free&quot; would be the best part,&quot; Hyun smiled and lifted Ling up into a hug and kissed her.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And to a degree, Ling had been happy with her pregnancy. It had its moments that created some anxiety and frustration, particularly as her fawn grew inside her. She&#39;d started thin and trim and as the nine months passed, her middle gradually got bigger and bigger. A part of her was surprised it went for as long as it did, as her species normally didn&#39;t carry its young for that long, but the doctors said that was likely a part of what came with being an Animalian, and that certain things wouldn&#39;t entirely cross over exactly. Human women delivered after nine months to a fully developed baby, and since deer of all species generally also delivered fully developed young, that nine month span for Humans carried over to Animalians. The only ones that had at least the potential for a shorter period of pregnancy were those mammals that typically carried their children for a shorter period of time and naturally gave birth to &quot;premature young,&quot; or those that laid eggs. Korean Water Deer didn&#39;t fall into that category, and thus Ling was pregnant for nine months.<br />
<br />
And as she felt her fawn grow inside her, Ling was happy. And when the fawn was strong enough to kick in Ling&#39;s womb, Ling was happy to show Hyun where the activity was and it made both of them happy. Of course, by the nineth month and the fawn, now found to be a girl, was getting big, that made Ling feel overly big and bloated. Thankfully, Hyun took all her pregnancy hormones in stride and was especially helpful when it came time to give birth in September 2023. Of course, that hurt, and Ling didn&#39;t want to dwell on that. Particularly as she also gave a lot of Korean curse words for the Japanese doctors to learn, that were mostly aimed at Hyun. But once their daughter was born, that didn&#39;t matter and she apologized to Hyun. Hyun told her that it was only the pain of labor and that she didn&#39;t need to be sorry.<br />
<br />
And looking down to the fawn, who looked up with big dark eyes and downy coat of black hair on her head, Ling could only smile. Her daughter had hair like her father. A part of her looked forward to brushing it to make her daughter beautiful and to light up the world. And as the television broadcast Sophie&#39;s second place finish in the race for the females to the top of Zodiac Mountain, which allowed her to jump up to first in the overall standings, Ling lowered one hand down her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eun-Woo Hyun, are you kicking your father again?&quot; Ling asked down to her daughter.<br />
<br />
The fawn took Ling&#39;s finger, only to get her check nuzzled by her father and gave a squeal of delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just my turn,&quot; Hyun said to her, &quot;besides... I can&#39;t be mad at someone who is so cute.&quot;</p>
