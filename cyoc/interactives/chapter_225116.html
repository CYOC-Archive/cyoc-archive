<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tod&#39;s brother, Alex, is a very nice and playful 10-year-old boy who loves to invent games with action figures. So, as they were still on their camping trip, Tod thought it was not a bad idea to try his power to grow people on him.  After all, they always got along together. <br />
<br />
That day, The kid seem to be bored, so he naturally came to Tod asking him to play or do cool stuff with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Bro, I&#39;ll be delight to, you know that! So what do you have in mind?&quot;, asked Tod with a very nice smile.<br />
<br />
Giving a long hug to his big bro, Alex said that he&#39;d love to play some games with his action figures in the woods like they were some kind of Scouters or explorers.  Yeah, but when Tod asked him if he&#39;d rather be a giant and play with tiny guys like he does with his action figures, he giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so it looks like you&#39;d find it funny then! Cool prepare yourself to have the fun of your life!&quot;, Tod replied with a very friendly smile.<br />
<br />
He told him to stand up, which he did, so concentrated on his awesome little bro to make him grow to a giant size. It was a good thing that the entire family was dressed in camouflage pants and shirts, in Alex&#39;s scenario, the tiny guys were explorers after all. <br />
<br />
To our 15-year-old size fetish boy, his dream came to reality. His cute little boy was actually growing to a giant size, he made him go on until he was around 10 times bigger than he was. Young Alex was confused to see that everything and everyone seemed to diminish around him. He felt lightheaded too, like being in a too fast elevator, so he almost lost his balance. It was very convenient that his clothes grew with him. But we have to say that the kid was not to far away from his puberty, he was growing a little before, and his camouflage camping pants pants were a a little too short and tight. Because he was doing lots of sports, including soccer and swimming, he was quite fit. <br />
<br />
Tod was looking up at him in awe as he stood upright between his giant hiking boots, realizing how quite muscled his bro&#39;s legs were. Sure the fact his pants were way too tight,  both his legs forms were very well displayed, including his groin.  His mom and sister ran away screaming, but his dad was also looking up in total disbelief.  There was also a middle-aged dad camping with his twin sons who tried to hide behind trees, but looking at the giant boy with some fear in their eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;WOW Tod, you were not joking! But how have you been able to grow me to that cool size?&quot;, the amused boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39; not sure,  I just heard a voice that told me I was able to shrink people, and to also restore theirs original size. So I did a few test, then I thought it was cool to grow you.&quot; He replied with a very enthusiasm tone.<br />
<br />
Their dad was not so happy that it scarred his wife and daughter to death. So he tried to reason with his sons. Tod replied:<br />
<br />
&quot;We are just playing, Dad. Have you not always told me to be nice to Alex and to play with him because he was still a little shy to make new friends?&quot;, said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Giant Alex loved to look at his tiny dad and older brother. from his point of view, he saw his dad&#39;s back because he was facing Tod as they talked.  The man did not pay attention to to kid who was squatting, too busy to try to understand why he had been up-sized by Tod. He knew it was him, he heard Tod when asked the boy about how cool it could be to be a giant. For the huge young guy, the temptation to play around with his dad was too great to resist. So as he always did with his action figures, he grabbed his dad by his middle section to lift him closer to his face.  Tod was amazed to see that man so easily been taken like a simple toy. His penis rose at a very high speed, his erection was so obvious, he had to reposition his cock upwards.  Daddy was squirming a little but Tod said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dad, he wont hurt you, he just want to play!&quot;<br />
<br />
Waving up at Alex, he expected to be taken too. It was not very long before he felt his brother&#39;s soft and warm hands taking him as well. As he loved both his dad and bro, he rubbed them against his cheeks and snuggled. He obviously had no idea that by doing so, his dad and bro&#39;s bulges were both stimulated, as he stroked them against his face.  The middle-aged dad and his twin sons were looking at the scene with less fear. From the corner of his eye, Alex saw them. Turning his head, he looked down at them, smiled and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you guys want to play with me too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Normal people would probably go too close to a giant boy.  But it ended up that the young teen twin boys were gay and their dad was a bit bisexual. To Alex&#39;s great pleasure, they left their hiding place to meet the giant boy. The big kid was giggling with happiness. He crossed his legs, seated like an Indian like they say. He put his dad on his left knee, Tod on his right one. As the other man and his sons came to his reach, he began by picking up the teens he then put near his crotch while he picked up their dad. Tod was amazed to see as fast the boys leaning against these soft genital forms and obviously comfortable for the back. Alex was curious about the man&#39;s body because he was able to feel the muscles under his clothes with his hands. So, without embarrassment as if he were holding one of his action figures, He pulled off the tiny shirt to then pulled down the tiny trousers or the tiny dad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what are you doing, son? Don&#39;t undress that man, it&#39;s wrong!&quot;,  Alex&#39;s dad with a tone of disapproval.<br />
<br />
But the man in the giant boy&#39;s hand said: &quot;It&#39;s Okay, your kid is just curious and I am fine with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
The tiny man was just wearing light blue brief underwear. Alex said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have more body hair than my dad has, more muscular too. I bet you go a lot to the gym&quot;, said smiling.<br />
<br />
The man smiled and thanked the boy. For sure he was such a stud, and from Tod&#39;s point of view, he saw that this man had a big erection, a huge bulge. Then, out of the blue, Alex gently put the man on his left thigh and picked up his dad. Yip, he has been undressed too. But it was not what disturbed his dad the most. Nope, he was held in his son&#39;s left fist and the other man was picked up in the right one. The silly kid was holding them next to each other to compare their bodies.  But for Tod, it was such an amazing view. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bro, what about you compare me with those nice twin boys?&quot;, he said with a very wide smile.<br />
<br />
Giggling, Alex put the man on his left knee and his dad on this right one. The twins seem to have understood what was next, so they pull off their hiking shoes and stood up. Without waiting, Alex picked up a first one and pulled off his clothes. But that teen has no underwear, he was almost bare naked beside his socks. He took the other one and same there, no underwear. hose young guy has very toned bodies, like swimmers. Also they both has erection. Tod was very happy that it was finally his turn. Effortless, his giant bro undressed him. He then laid him on his left thigh, and the twins together on his right one. <br />
<br />
What do you want to do next bro? Asked Tod...</p>
