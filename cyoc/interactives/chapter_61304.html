<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Change me back, now!&quot; Juan pleaded while cowering at Ty's feet. &quot;Pleeeease!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to your steroid ridden body? Fat chance. Earn it the normal way.&quot; Ty sighed, shrugging off Juan's pleas<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't! I used them to help...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's a lame excuse, you know there's other ways. Steroids are bad for you, they'll be the end of you too. <br />
Why not just ask for me to buff you out if you're that desperate?&quot; Ty said, feeling sorry for Juan now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care. I'd rather be dead than weak. Give me back my old body. No, wait, you owe me, make it even <br />
better! Like years after training!&quot; Juan demanded, grabbing a hold of Ty and looking him square in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but you won't like it. I'll age you to 24, 7 years of extremely heavy duty steroid use.&quot; Ty gave in, <br />
he'd have to show Juan the hard way.<br />
<br />
Juan felt it, the surge of energy he once had. The surge he'd get whenever he juiced up or pumped iron, <br />
coursing through his veins, filling every fiber of his being with its power. His testicles shrank back useless raisins, now permanently shut off due to the years of steroid usage. Juan's body started from the inside out, <br />
causing his bones to elongate and thicken to support an extremely heavy body. Juan grew back to 6 feet tall, <br />
while his face broadened and became masculine, his Adams Apple also grew in size, helping to make his voice as <br />
deep and smooth as it once was. The veins he once had pushed their way to the surface of his skin, brining hundreds of new veiny friends with them. At this point, his heart was pumping at 115 beats per minute, his <br />
veins pulsating with each thump of his heart.<br />
<br />
The flab he had melted away, almost down to 0%, while his muscles exploded, fighting for space on his body. He <br />
looked down, but his view was quickly obscured by his protruding chest. He tried to bend over to look at his <br />
legs, but his new back muscles made it slightly difficult. Still, he saw his legs, now as thick as tree <br />
trunks. He totally ignored his member, which now looked laughably small compared to the rest of him. He looked <br />
over at his arms and flexed, his jaw dropping as he saw a muscle hill become a mountain on top of a mountain. <br />
He ran his hands over his abdomen, shocked by how far they were protruding. He found it even weirder that they <br />
were growing outward... No, his stomach was, and he felt like his insides were being tightened. The truth was, <br />
his intestines were growing, giving him a large roid gut. It looked like he was 3 months pregnant now, just <br />
with 8 cobblestone abs on his stomach. His arms now grew too large to touch the top of his head, while his <br />
neck was so thick that it hurt to look left or right. <br />
<br />
Now his heart was beating faster and faster, the juice coursing through his veins causing him to become feral. <br />
The veins were now ridiculous in size and number, and they appeared to be having trouble pumping blood throughout his system now, despite his heart beating so fast. He was sporting an erection, now, which was <br />
nothing to really be proud of. He punched in lockers, crushed them flat like they were soda cans, then turned <br />
around to see Ty standing there. The more he crushed, the larger his gut got, his organs growing in size due <br />
to the steroids, being crushed against his muscles and bone. The rush kept him from realizing the pain, as he <br />
had another painful urge to satisfy... Down below. He ran for Ty, ready to &quot;relieve&quot; one of his beastly urges <br />
only to find pain stop him dead in his tracks. His right arm went completely numb, while his entire torso <br />
screamed in agony. His heart was beating erratically. Basically, his organs were too big for him to be doing <br />
any &quot;rough&quot; activities safely, and he was also having a sever heart attack. He was roaring in agony, tears <br />
rolling down his handsome face, sweat rolling over his incredibly strong body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help...&quot; He weakly mouthed, slowly crawling towards Ty. He couldn't make it and went belly-up, as if he were <br />
a fish.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Years of severe steroid abuse. I thought you were smarter than that. Yeah you're the strongest man, but <br />
now you're also dying.&quot; Ty said, shaking his head. He walked towards the enormous man and knelt by his side. <br />
He took his hand and put it over Juan's spastic heart, causing it to beat slower and with a more rhythmic pace <br />
until it was finally at a safer 100 beats per minute. Ty also made it so all Juan's muscles would relax so his <br />
internal organs wouldn't be crushed too much. He wiped the tears from Juan's eyes. &quot;That's why I shrunk you <br />
down in the first place. Yeah I'm mad at you too, but I didn't want to picture my friend DYING a few years <br />
from now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juan just stared at Ty, expressionless. Ty didn't know what to expect, until he felt a giant, warm, solid mass <br />
pull him closer towards Juan's chest. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Juan said, giving Ty a tiny squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay. You can stay this way, but I can't guarantee you won't get another heart attack. And you can't do <br />
much because of that whole roid gut thing. Do you want to stay like this? I'd rather you didn't. I could just <br />
make it so you're big without steroids, so you'd be super healthy instead of... Like this. I can do a lot of <br />
things to help make you happy.&quot; Ty sincerely said, trying to wrap his arms around Juan's chest. Though, it was <br />
too wide, so it looked like he'd have to settle with spreading his arms over Juan's large chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don't want to be weak. But I guess there has to be a limit.&quot; Juan toyed with a few ideas in his head <br />
until he found one he absolutely was sure about. Now he just wanted to word it properly so Ty wouldn't make <br />
any mistakes.</p>
