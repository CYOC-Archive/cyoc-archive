<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
*That’ll be one of Gavin’s friends for the sleepover.* Mary, Gavin’s mum thought, and stopped her work on her laptop to quickly head over to the front door. She was glad things were seemingly getting back to normal for her son. Well, as normal as it could get for a boy now considered property of a pharmaceutical company. This was the first time in two years that Gavin could spend time with his friends without the continual lawsuits looming over them. The results may not have been anything ideal, but at least it was over now. After almost two months being back at school, Mary had agreed to let Gavin have a sleepover party with some friends, under supervision, she didn’t have to remind him of the consequences of the last unsupervised one.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to get the first guest, Mary was met with Gavin’s friend Phil, completely naked on the doorstep, with his overnight bag hanging over one shoulder. Her eyes immediately dropped to the poor boy’s gargantuan testicles and very well endowed penis, before awkwardly bouncing back to the teen’s eyes. After two years, Mary was used to seeing Gavin naked both at home and in public and with his oversized testicles. But she hadn’t seen many of his classmates since the incident. This was one of Gavin’s close friends, who Mary had met many times before and even knew his mother, so to see him like this, nude for all to see, was definitely something she had trouble with processing in a timely way. Phil’s balls were not the cause of her staring really, rather the size of his penis, which apparently wasn’t a side effect but completely natural or so the gossip between some of the mothers had said. Feeling her eye’s on him, Phil moved his other hand slightly in front of his exposed cock, as a failed attempt to hide the curiosity of his member. Embarrassed, they both politely greeted each other and Mary sent Phil down to where Gavin had set up the beds in the basement. Phil headed off in that direction, his walk more of a weird shuffle now, just like Gavin, due to his heavy massive testicles dragging behind his thighs, preventing any easy movement.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later the doorbell rang again. Mary welcomed in the very polite Roy, naked as expected, but only slightly larger testicles than a normal teen’s, like the majority of the boys affected. His body however, unlike the rest, was slightly chubby around his waist. Mary wouldn’t have even noticed other than the fact that she knew the pills had made all the boys&#39; metabolisms almost impossible to put on fat. Then she noticed the purplish patch of skin along his slight belly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Roy, were you hurt? Do you need something for that nasty bruise?”<br />
Roy was first confused, then realized. “Oh, no, no. Don’t worry it is nothing, honest.”<br />
“It certainly doesn’t look like ‘nothing’!” Mary retorted, her motherly instincts kicking in. “Did something hit you on the way here? I have arnica you can take for the bruising.”<br />
“No, haha, it’s actually from school.” Roy explained. “We were at cooking class this week, and the teacher supposedly ran out of blueberries, so had me volunteer to replicate the missing ingredients. Basically Genodyne had a new formula they wanted to test and he thought this was appropriate given the situation. Now my body continuously produces some sort of juice, and I kinda swell if I don’t remove the excess.”<br />
“You have to be kidding me?!” Mary said before sighing. “Well I guess the experimental procedures on you all were allowed under that hack judge&#39;s ruling. Are you ok now?”<br />
“Yes ma’am, it is easily dealt with. Mr Brackner and the class observed me throughout the day, without intervention my entire body swelled up like a balloon… well more like a giant beach ball, and the color of a blueberry. I felt like I was going to burst from all the juice inside me by the end of the day, but they had me… ah… Juiced- just in time for the class pies to be baked.”<br />
“Juiced?” Mary asked, almost lost from  the absurdity of what the poor boy was saying.<br />
“Removing the excess liquid through my nipples and… ah..” Roy stopped, suddenly very embarrassed to elaborate.<br />
Mary picked up on what he was implying and interrupted. “Oh yes, say no more. But will you be ok here for the night?” She asked with sympathy.<br />
<br />
Visibly relieved that Gavin’s mum saved him from having to talk about how he was effectively given a hand job by one of his classmates to ejaculate the juice into a tank while two others had to milk his bloated nipples to do the same, Roy turned and brought out a bucket from his pack. “Yes ma’am. Now as long as I juice myself into this bucket every time I feel a bit bloated then it’s no problem.” <br />
Horrified of the poor boy’s fate to be a seemingly endless source of blueberry juice all for nothing more than a school&#39;s baking assignment. <br />
<br />
She decided not to pry any further and directed him to where he will find Gavin and Phil. But she couldn’t shake the thought that sooner or later, her precious boy will have to participate in some sort of “learning demonstrations” more life altering than a prehensile penis, and there will be nothing she could do to prevent it.</p>
