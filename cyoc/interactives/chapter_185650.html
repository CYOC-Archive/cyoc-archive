<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door behind the throne room leads to a long, windowed hall where you can catch a glimpse of the forest outside the city, a final reminder of the life you would be losing once the King added you to his beastly harem. The sight shakes you from your hypnosis and you slow for a second before one of the guards roughly shoves you forward. Without the King staring at you with his crotch in your face, you were able to think clearly. You had to find a way out of here, but with the guards on high alert and the King’s ability to make anyone obedient, you really didn’t see how you would ever make it out of here. <br />
<br />
“Darin!” you whisper, trying to find the man who had been in the cell next to you. Maybe with a stronger partner like him, the two of you could find a way out. <br />
<br />
You get no response though, and as you peer through the crowd of bare flesh you soon see why. Poor Darin is standing directly behind the king, completely entranced by his magic and eagerly trotting along behind. The proud mercenary was reduced to a pitiful lapdog, and along with him went your farfetched hopes of escape. You decide to take one last look out of the tall gothic windows, resigning yourself to your fate. <br />
<br />
Distracted by the view, you didn’t notice the column of men come to a sudden stop. You blindly walk into the backside of the wolf guard who growls in annoyance and pushes you back into place before standing at attention again. You look up to see what was causing the holdup and notice a new beastman standing in the hall next to the King. This one appears to be an ocelot, much younger and leaner than the King; a strapping young man in his early to mid twenties by the look of him, about your age. He was short and lithely muscular, only coming up to the King’s shoulders, but he held himself with the same dignity and commanding presence, and the fact that he wears the same regal-looking cloak as the lion, you can guess at who he is. The King throws his arms up and smiles, breaking the stoic and grizzled demeanor you had seen just a moment ago.<br />
<br />
“Ah! My illustrious Son is back from the field!” The big lion embraces the ocelot lad, the two of them sharing a kiss that was much more than platonic. “See what your soldiers have brought home for me today? Truly they would be lost without your leadership and our city would be neither as populous nor as prosperous as it is!”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Father! I am glad that my efforts are pleasing to you.” He paused, taking a moment to inspect the group. “A fine group of humans to join our fair city. You are taking them to the ceremony then?”<br />
<br />
“Indeed, my boy, but don’t think that I’ve forgotten my promise to you!” The King stretched out his hand towards the group of men still staring at him in their trance. “You may take whichever one of these prisoners you wish. I’m pleased to see you’re finally taking an interest in starting your own harem. Hunting is fun, but a future king should not sully his hands with such indecencies unless he needs to. I promise you’ll be much happier here in the palace! Now, which of these humans tickles your fancy?”<br />
<br />
The Beast Prince strides along the assemblage with the eye of a predator. You can almost feel him analyzing each man, sizing them up and determining their worth in a glance. He passes up every single one of them, however, clearly not impressed with the showing. That is, until he comes to you. His gaze locks onto you, and despite your efforts to avoid eye contact, you are forced to meet his stare, just as you were with the King. Your defenses drop once more as you are subjected to the Prince’s powers. He has the same unnatural, piercing purple eyes as his father; eyes that seem to transfix you with comfort and desire. Eyes that seem to stare into your very soul. <br />
<br />
He is the most beautiful creature you had ever seen. Though he is not as imposing as the King, he still gives off an aura of authority, made all the more impactful by its unassuming package. Even though he is a full hand shorter than you, you feel as though you are looking up to him from the floor. His tousled head-fur gives a playful impression while his bare chest heaves gently with each breath, elaborating every muscle on his perfectly sculpted body. And, of course, you couldn’t ignore the hefty organ swinging between his legs; the only part of him that wasn’t smaller than his father, if anything maybe a bit bigger. He exuded an intoxicating musk from his exposed crotch, wafting up from his open cloak, and you wanted nothing more than to drop to your knees right there and pleasure him in every way imaginable, but you stayed still, fearing he wouldn’t pick you if you didn’t wait for his command. Wait, why did you want him to pick you? You weren’t sure, but you knew you needed him to. <br />
<br />
As he watches you, the Prince’s serious face breaks into an impish grin. “Well, hello there,” He says softly, playfully; his seductive voice making you shiver with need. “Aren’t you a little troublemaker?”<br />
<br />
“Have you found one you like, my Son?”<br />
<br />
The King has caught up with the Prince, staring at you with the same purple gaze, but for some reason you no longer feel an attraction to the old lion, your desires now firmly fixed on the young ocelot. The King gives you a slightly confused look, eyeing up his son’s choice against the multitude of stronger, more impressive looking men gathered around. <br />
<br />
“You’re sure this is the one you want to start your harem? He looks like he’d be more fitting as a stable boy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, I’m quite sure,” the Prince replied, lifting your chin up to inspect your face as he grinned, making you weak in the knees. “Yes, he’ll do nicely. I have plans in mind for this one.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, it is your choice. Guard!” he called over the bear. “Escort the Prince back to his chambers.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Father, but as Captain of the Hunt, I think I can handle one human by myself.”<br />
<br />
“Ho? I suppose you do have something special in mind for him then,” the King replied, his own mischievous smile matching his son’s. “Alright then, men, let’s teach the rest of these humans their place!”<br />
<br />
The guards cheered and the group of prisoners was led on out of the hall, following their new King to his bed chambers. You manage to break your gaze from the Prince long enough to watch the mob of hypnotized men disappear through another doorway, leaving the two of you in silence. For a long moment, you stand motionless, both terrified and excited for what he has in store for you. <br />
<br />
“Do you know how you do it?” he asked suddenly. <br />
<br />
“How I do what?” you ask, turning around and getting hit by another wave of lust for the sexy feline as soon as you met his gaze.<br />
<br />
“This, how you’re resisting my powers.”<br />
<br />
“I am?” you question, not feeling as though you were resisting all that well.<br />
<br />
“You are; more than the average human, at least. I noticed you were free of my Father’s grip when you walked into that guard.  I couldn’t risk him seeing your resistance, even if only momentarily, or he would have had you killed. But someone like you could be useful to me. Come, let us return to my chambers; we have much to discuss.”</p>
