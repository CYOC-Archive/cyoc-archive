<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Only about an hour or so had gone by before S.P.E.A.R. showed up to collect the Amberhills. In that time, Mary was keeping the werewolves secure while Jolie kept an eye on Trisha. Bob and Annie Pendragon were helping Lilith, Eliana, Rebecca, and Alyssa recover from their wounds and injuries. Connor breathed a great sigh of relief seeing the trucks and S.P.E.A.R. agents arrive to collect the werewolves. Battered and bruised, the hunter grunted, wincing in pain as he noticed his old friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, you certainly took your sweet time in getting here.&quot; Connor slightly joked as Nat MacGregor approached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was getting some of my best agents together to bring in the Amberhills.&quot; Nat MacGregor said motioning towards Tom Harris and his partner Alexa Ross who greeted Connor with a few nods as he nodded back.<br />
<br />
Tom and Alexa, along with other S.P.E.A.R. agents that had come with them were putting specially made hand cuffs so they wouldn&#39;t sheath their claws, as well as muzzles over the mouths of the werewolves. Tom had his magic at the ready should Henry try anything while Alexa was in her Nekomata holding tightly onto Effie Amberhill, who was a lot more resistant in her constraints.<br />
<br />
&quot;When my daughter and I make bail, vampire, we&#39;re going to....&quot; Henry began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make bail?! I don&#39;t think so asshole.&quot; Nat scoffed at that Henry&#39;s remark. &quot;S.P.E.A.R. has your ass on home invasion, attempted murder, and assault and battery.&quot; Nat glared at Henry as Tom and Alexa took Henry and Effie inside the vans to properly secure them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Nat, I just remembered: Amberhill sent Dark Garden to attack the other Solar Guardian members to keep them away from us.&quot; Lilith suddenly remembered in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about them. I got word in from the others, they&#39;re all fine, they had a little extra help.&quot; Nat reassured Lilith.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Princess Winery had arrived a little earlier to help Solar Guardian Mars and her husband, the Solar Sentinel against Sinister Carnation and the Dark Watchman. It had been quite a fight, but the Dark Garden members were aware when they were outmatched, especially when it was against a werewolf.<br />
<br />
After the fight, Martin and Marilyn O&#39;Toole were certainly exhausted. They would&#39;ve been even more exhausted in their older forms, but both agreed to stay in their younger forms for the rest after their fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for showing up when you did. I don&#39;t know why those two decided to attack us when they did.&quot; Marilyn said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;A werewolf criminal by the name of Henry Amberhill did this. He and I are going to have a long talk when I see him.&quot; Winery said hitting her fist into her hand.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Daydream Rose had come just in the nick of time to help Solar Guardian Mercury and Solar Guardian Sun against Malevolent Azalea and Sorrow Orchid. Daydream Rose managed to knock out Sorry Orchid first not long after she appeared.<br />
<br />
Malevolent Azalea went over to pick up her unconscious teammate before looking towards the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Missy said to her old friends as they all looked a little sad but understood that she didn&#39;t have much choice in the matter if she wanted to remain as a mole on the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Felicity smirked. &quot;Smacking around Sorrow Orchid is one of my favorite hobbies. Just keep yourself safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Poison Lotus was a phenomenal help Solar Guardian Neptune as she had managed to hold her own against both Void Dandelion and Bloody Dahlia. Poison Lotus had helped to turn the tide as she fought off Bloody Dahlia while Neptune took on Void Dandelion and knocked her unconscious as she reverted to her May Harring form. Now a fragile looking ebony haired woman lay where Void Dandelion stood. Slowly, May began to stir as she groaned in pain.<br />
<br />
Bloody Dahlia believed enough time had been wasted fighting these two and couldn&#39;t waste anymore time, even if it mean leaving Void Dandelion behind.<br />
<br />
Tess had changed back to her regular form as she held May while she was laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...? Oh...what...what happened? Tess? Oh no, did I....change again? I&#39;m so sorry if I hurt you.&quot; May apologized as Tess shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t blame you, you just thought you had gotten better.&quot; Tess reassured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, it seems you&#39;ll need to spend a little more time in counseling at S.P.E.A.R.&quot; Michelle said adjusting her glasses. &quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re okay May. I know there&#39;s struggles you&#39;ve had with Void Dandelion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Michelle and yeah, I guess I do. Tess, will you come support me? I could really use my best friend with me.&quot; May asked as Tess grew a wide smile on her face before grabbing May and pulling her into a hug which squeezed her into Tess&#39;s massive breasts<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course! You&#39;re my bestest friend in the whole world and I love you too much to see anything bad ever happen to you!&quot; Tess said happily as May could only pat Tess on the back as thanks.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Back at Eliana Hoti&#39;s home, Lilith smiled at Connor Moreland who came back over to talk with the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, I think I speak for everyone when I say this: thank you for coming when you did. How can we repay you for what you&#39;ve done for us tonight?&quot; Lilith asked as she finished taking care of Alyssa&#39;s injured leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of you have to worry about repaying me. My dad told me a long time ago: &#39;a hunter serves for others, not themselves&#39;. Just to see you all safe and alive is enough.&quot; Connor said with smile as Rebecca held tightly onto her mother who still ached all over her body but wanted to feel her daughter&#39;s arms around her. Lilith wrapped her arm around Alyssa&#39;s shoulders smiling at her daughter and gave her a kiss as Mary sat down beside Lilith and put a gentle hand on her daughter&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound just as sentimental as your father did once upon a time.&quot; Hailey Meyers said arriving on the scene to see the last of the werewolves being loaded into the S.P.E.A.R. vans as Tom and Alexa stood nearby Hailey and Nat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amberhill and his crew are well secured and ready for departure, director.&quot; Nat said nodding towards Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, have the men head back to headquarters, I&#39;ll finish speaking with the others here.&quot; Hailey said as Nat headed towards the vans.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to warn you all about another player out on the field.&quot; Hailey began to tell the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Director, is it really a good idea to tell them this now after everything they&#39;ve been through?&quot; Tom asked Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s better we tell them now than later.&quot; Hailey said taking a deep breath before speaking again. &quot;For the past 16 years now, S.P.E.A.R has been on the trail of essentially a super soldier. They&#39;ve killed many within the supernatural community and seem to think what they&#39;re doing is a righteous cause. Be on your guard and watch each other&#39;s backs.&quot; Hailey said to them all as she turned to leave.<br />
<br />
Connor turned to leave as well before Rebecca called out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Moreland, wait!&quot; Rebecca said as Connor turned around to find himself getting hugged by Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for saving my mom.&quot; Rebecca thanked Connor smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime.&quot; Connor replied. &quot;Now you all have a good night. I have a feeling I&#39;m in for an earful from my wife.&quot; Connor sighed with a smile shaking his head as he left the farm family alone as they all take a long deserved rest in their beds.</p>
