<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack turned to find that Elle gone.  Disappeared without a sound.  She was not one for playing hide-and-seek.  Jack was at a loss for an explanation.  The air-mattress seemed different.  Warily, Jack inched toward the bed.  Something odd was up.<br />
<br />
Jack placed his hand on the mattress.  It had changed.  Before it had been a simple camp accessory; tough cover over thick plastic air-bladder.  But now it was slick rubber; glossy all over and a rich light blue colour.  Under his hand the material felt cool and softly yielding but firm.  Jack could almost believe that it was filled with liquid instead of air.  It was so smooth he could almost imagine the mattress was no more than the top of a shallow tank filled with an oily fluid.  He should be looking for Elle instead of being so focused on this blow-up bed.<br />
<br />
Jack slapped the mattress for no other reason than to put an end to his distraction and to start his search for where Elle had sneaked off.  But that slap had caused a ripple to race across the bed.  Like a wave on a pond the ripple flowed to the edge and then rebounded.  Quickly the surface was a criss-crossed pattern of wave interactions.  The effect would have been hypnotic if it was not for as he watched a shape formed from the wave crests.  As the shape became more defined the rest of the surface became smooth once again.  The shape was that of a human female and it rose from the surface as if rising from the depths of a liquid filled tank.  When everything was once again still Jack was shocked when the eyes of the womanly shape opened.<br />
<br />
Frightened into immobility, Jack held his breath while he studied the figure.  It was certainly female; he could tell since it lacked clothes.  The woman was smooth, light-blue latex.  There was no other way to put it.  Every part of her was coated or made-of the same latex as the air-mattress.  Jack could see toes that seemed to be melded together; long legs that were toned; wide hips that led up to a very narrow waist by a flat, toned stomach; breasts that were round, large and proud.  Jack noted the small dainty hands at the ends of slim arms separated by narrow shoulders.  The most striking feature was her head.  It was bald.  She also seemed to be missing ears, though there were slight lumps where her ears would have been.  It was as if she was wearing a tight, smooth hood.<br />
<br />
When Jack's eyes finally met hers he noticed her face.  It was small and pleasing.  Her eyes were large and clear of the light-blue rubber.  They did not seem like human eyes but they did have characteristics that left no doubt that there was a mind behind them.  Later with some reflection Jack would liken them to the beautifully drawn eyes of an animated cartoon.  Detailed in the finest but not so much to pass over the comfort ridge of the uncanny-valley.  Between her eyes she lacked a proper nose.  There was a triangular, soft bump that suggested a nose but no holes for breathing could be seen.  Below that there were full, sexy lips that were covered with the same liquid coating that covered the rest of her body.  But Jack was brought back to her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; the creature said when she noticed Jack staring.  Her lips could open.  There was a hole behind them also, or at least a pocket.  How she could talk was only a lesser mystery than the fact that there was a talking rubber woman on his air-mattress.  But even the word 'on' did not fit correctly.  For indeed, she did not lay upon the bed but seemed to be melded with the bed.  Around her entire body there was a tiny curve where the material of her body became the material of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi,&quot; Jack said lamely.<br />
<br />
The woman rose a little so that she seemed to be leaning on her elbows.  As she did so, her legs seemed to sink deeper under the surface of the bed.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  She said looking deep into Jack's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Jack,&quot; he said watching her.  He suspected that he was about to be the first victim in a horror movie.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Jack's bed-friend,&quot; the slick, blue girl-shape said smiling.<br />
<br />
It was the smile that did it.  Jack knew that smile.  He had done everything in his power over the past two years to see that smile as often as he could.  He had kissed that smile so many times that he could not dare to even think of counting.  That was the smile Elle had given him when he had first asked her on a date.  Jack loved that smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  That is my name.&quot;  Her voice was familiar but somehow happy and breathy and full of youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elle, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.  Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll say it is.  You're inside of my air-mattress!&quot;  Jack was nearly in hysterics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, silly-Jack.  Where did you think a bed-friend would be?  In your desk?&quot;  At that she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is a bed-friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly, it's like a girl-friend.  I am the bed that you chose to have a close, personal relationship with.  Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack's head was spinning.  &quot;I think I need sit down for a minute and think this through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you come sit on me, Jack.&quot;  Elle said sweetly.</p>
