<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd decided that it would be a good idea to try socializing. So, he got up, hid the remote in his pocket, and <br />
walked over to the pair talking. He stood by them for a few moments, as they were engrossed in conversation. <br />
He tried getting attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls completely ignored him and kept talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey?&quot; Todd said again, louder this time.<br />
<br />
Still no luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; He said, louder than he hoped, and Sandy and Evie both gave him a annoyed look. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; muttered Sandy.<br />
<br />
Todd couldn't find any words to say. He had always been socially awkward to everyone, especially around hot <br />
girls.<br />
<br />
Evie butted in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you see we're talking here? Just tell us what you want, or leave...&quot; she said in a rude fashion.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, well... nothing really. Nevermind.&quot; said Todd nervously. <br />
<br />
Todd almost kicked himself for that. Failed again. He walked off feeling left out as the two girls watched him <br />
leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a loser...&quot; said Sandy bitterly behind his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no wonder he's all alone.&quot; added Evie. <br />
<br />
They both laughed and returned to conversation. Todd returned to his hiding spot and sulked. <br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I hate to admit it, they're right. I am a loser. I am alone. And I don't think that'll change...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Todd had a rather crazy idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, maybe I could... no Todd, you're not thinking straight. Think of your family, your life. You <br />
can't do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd sat back in the corner, knowing that nothing could be done. But then, he remembered something and his <br />
face brightened once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if I remember, I could program the remote to reverse changes too. It's a bit risky, and still very much <br />
experimental, but a test run wouldn't hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Todd pulled out the remote again. He tweaked some features and changed the mode once more. Then, he <br />
rushed out to the changing rooms down the corridor. This was going to be good.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
He arrived at the changing rooms a few minutes later, as they were near the end of the school. He entered and <br />
sat down on a bench. He then checked and double checked the settings, aimed it at his chest, and pressed the <br />
button.<br />
<br />
The changes were almost instantaneous. First, he started growing. He was a measly 5'2&quot;, but he started slowly <br />
getting taller. 5'5&quot;, 5'7&quot;. Still growing. 5'8&quot;, 5'11&quot;. He stopped at at around 6'3&quot;. He smiled to himself. <br />
All was going well so far. <br />
<br />
Next, his shoulders widened and broadened into powerful pecs, and his belly pushed into a solid six-pack. His <br />
complexion became more handsome, and his arms and legs began bulging with muscle. Soon enough, he was a six <br />
foot jock, and his clothes were strained tight against his much larger build.<br />
<br />
He flexed his arms and legs, showing off his new strength. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! I should have no problem talking to them now.&quot; He said out loud, and began walked across the <br />
changing room to the door. As he did though, his trouser leg caught on the remote and dragged it along the <br />
bench. Todd was oblivious to this, too soaked up in his new form. <br />
<br />
But everything has to come to an end sometime, as he was about to find out. The remote reached the end of the <br />
bench and fell, landing side down on the floor, and right on the buttons. The force of impact knocked around <br />
the electronics in the device, changing the mode and all the settings. The remote changed to the last preset <br />
and activated.<br />
<br />
Todd just noticed as the contraption beeped, but it was too late. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; he whispered with a certain amount of shock.<br />
<br />
He felt his body changing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no no no no no!&quot; shouted Todd as he body began to shrink once more and his muscles vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as it was getting go-&quot; <br />
<br />
Todd was interrupted abruptly as a striking pain coursed his body. He screamed as his body became more <br />
slender, even more than the skinny self he was originally. His waist cracked narrower, his ass blossomed <br />
rounder and larger, and two large round mounds virtually ballooned out of his chest. His hair kept the ginger <br />
colour he had had before, but grew longer and, much like Evie, stopped at his shoulders. <br />
<br />
His yell turned into a female scream, and he dropped to the floor. There he panted heavily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifted up, and almost fell back down in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck no!&quot;<br />
<br />
His large D-cup breasts were covering the view of his legs, and they were pushed together by his shirt, which <br />
was already very much strained by his new assets. Several buttons had also popped of the shirt, leaved lots of <br />
cleavage.<br />
<br />
His ass also felt tight, pressing against his trousers. He stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be... the remote, it backfired!&quot; said Todd in disbelief.<br />
<br />
He picked up the remote. It looked alright, but it needed a new battery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rolled up his trousers to the thigh to allow more flexibilty, revealing his silky smooth and curvy legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's look on the bright side: at least it didn't change me mentally...&quot;<br />
<br />
But now what could he possibly do? Return to the library? Find some new clothes? Run away? Or maybe give this <br />
body a check out before doing anything else? His mind was abuzz with options.</p>
