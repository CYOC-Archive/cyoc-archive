<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Zack put his hand in his crotch he instructed Tyler to suck his cock.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation Tyler obeyed the command even though he was revolted by the idea. Zack&#39;s cock was huge and it gagged Tyler since he was not use to the act but soon he got his rhythm down and was taking Zack balls deep.<br />
<br />
You did very well Zack tells Tyler. Almost like a pro. And we will see how expert you are tonight.<br />
<br />
Tonight ran through Tyler&#39;s head? What is happening tonight?<br />
<br />
As the day wore on and Tyler gave Zack a tongue bath cleaning up the stink that permeated Zack, gagging with each lick.<br />
<br />
When 8 pm rolled around there came a knock on the door. As instructed Tyler answered the door completely naked and there was a big man. Must have been 400 pounds of pure muscle. Blocking any view out the door. Tyler thanked the heavens that no one would be able to see his naked body except this behemoth. But it also blocked the six other men behind him with a smaller but similar build.<br />
<br />
Tyler beckoned them in and they sat down ignoring him like he was a piece of furniture.<br />
<br />
As they sat around the TV and Zack joined the party Tyler was instructed to get each one a beer and he swiftly got back to them with beers for all.<br />
<br />
After about half a dozen beers the biggest guy started to rise.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s up Zack asked?<br />
<br />
Need to drain the snake. <br />
<br />
Take care of that for him Tyler. Zack instructed.<br />
<br />
And without hesitation Tyler knelt in front of the man unzipping his pants and taking his thick cock in his mouth and the man began to pee like a racehorse. Tyler knew that he couldn&#39;t spill a drop but was revolted by what he was doing.<br />
<br />
As he finished with him he looked around and each one of the others was beckoning him to them.<br />
<br />
As he finished each one he felt bloated with each ones fill and was instructed to resume the service. Tyler groaned knowing that he was just refilling them for another round.<br />
<br />
A few hours in and serving them beer after beer and a full set of snacks one began to get up and Zack asked what was wrong? I got to go.<br />
<br />
Oh? You mean leave?<br />
<br />
No. I got to go take a shit.<br />
<br />
Oh well just a minute the bathroom isn&#39;t ready yet. Give me a second.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later Zack came out carrying something and sat it on the floor in the corner. Pulling off the cover There was a seat with a toilet seat and a hole in the center. There you go. Tyler assume the position.<br />
<br />
Tyler didn&#39;t need to be told what to do he just knew and was even more revolted than anything else he had done that day. He crawled under it and opened his mouth.<br />
<br />
As he finished with this one he would lick his lips clean and resume service and take his place at the toilet when required. The night wore on and Tyler was filled over and over with shit and piss and cum at both ends. As the night wore on and it got to about 3 and the party broke up Zack went to bed and told Tyler to sit in the corner till he came for him in the morning.<br />
<br />
And all that he was filled with weighed heavily in him.  He wanted to take a piss and he wanted to throw up every bit of that shit in him but he was instructed to sit there.<br />
<br />
When the morning came Zack came out and told Tyler to assume the position and he crawled under the seat and Zack took the biggest shit he had taken all night. Zack played with Tyler&#39;s extremely bloated belly. He looked like he was pregnant with triplets. Tyler has been digesting his fill and needed to evacuate and Tyler was instructed to use the bathroom. Zack had thought about having Tyler shit and eat his own shit but he liked that Tyler was only eating others shit and drinking their piss.<br />
<br />
You did well last night. That belly expanded well. A few more months and that belly will be able to take a full  bar night.<br />
<br />
Bar night Tyler thought. What is a full bar night Tyler asked?<br />
<br />
Well my friend at the Bear Nook needs a good toilet for a special event and I have volunteered your services. I told him I need to get you trained well before and this is what is happening now. That belly will expand greatly when filled and look like a deflated balloon when I let you empty it.<br />
<br />
Tyler had worked on his body all his life and the thought of having it destroyed really made him cry.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s ok Zack said. You will get use to it and eventually crave it.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked up at Zack and plead with him. Please don&#39;t<br />
<br />
Zack just had a devious grin on his face.</p>
