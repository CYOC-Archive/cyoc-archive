<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kylie straightened up her room, she began to wonder about what her life would be like now.  She hoped to be able to count on Jennifer, Liz, Trish, and Jamie.  She didn't care if she was popular, but that would be a nice bonus.  One thing she was determined not to change was the good points of Kyle's character.  Kyle had always been kind, generous, and intelligent.  That wouldn't change she decided.  Kyle had also been extremely shy.  She figured that while she could still be laid back, there was no harm in being more outgoing.  It would pretty much be required of her now anyway since she would be a cheerleader.  She also already had the advantage of seeing the bad sides of Jennifer's character.  The bossy, snobby attitude would not be hers.  Trish and Liz seemed to carry that to some extent too.  Trish also seemed to be overly proud of her body and her sexual conquests.  Now Kylie understood why she had heard some people call her a slut.  She decided that wouldn't be her either.  <br />
<br />
As she thought about what she had seen of the characters from the four girls, she couldn't find anything negative about Jamie.  She had shown Kylie to be kind, understanding, temperate, thoughtful, sweet, and quick on her wits.  She was also extremely beautiful.  Just thinking about her striptease was making Kylie feel extremely hot.  The way she moved, everything was erotic.  Then she had stuck her tongue in Kylie's pussy.  It felt soooo good, Kylie thought.  She began to reach her own hands down to her slit.  But suddenly she stopped herself.  What was she doing?  Did she have feelings for Jamie?  Was she still attracted to her now that she was female?  She had to sit down and think.  Did she still want to be attracted to girls?  &quot;Am I a lesbian?&quot; she said out loud.  Her mind was very confused.<br />
<br />
Jamie raced home in order to get back to Kylie's house as quickly as she could.  She had a sense for tact, and in this case she didn't want to upset Kylie's parents by returning to their house too late.  She ran into the house, and found her mother sitting in the kitchen, going over the day's mail.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Where've you been?&quot; her mother asked.  &quot;Shoot, I forgot to call,&quot; she responded.  &quot;Sorry, we were trying to get this cheer done and Kylie had a problem we were helping her with.&quot;  Her mother looked somewhat surprised at the last sentence.  Jamie feared that she wouldn't know who Kylie was.  Her mother said, &quot;That seems odd.  I thought she never had problems.  Gee, I'd figure Trish or Jenn would have had a problem.&quot;  Jamie breathed a huge sigh of relief internally.  The curse had worked fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here's the thing.  Kylie and I are both having some problems in math.  I wanted to stay over her house tonight if that was OK with you.  Her parents said they didn't have a problem with it if you didn't.&quot;  Her mother didn't look to pleased with her.  She probably wasn't happy that she hadn't called.  She asked, &quot;Do you really think it will help the both of you?&quot;  Jamie quickly answered, &quot;Definitely, Mom.  And this is the only class I'm really struggling with right now.&quot;  That was partially true.  Her mother said, &quot;Yea that's fine, then.  Just please call me to make sure you're there.&quot;  &quot;Sure thing,&quot; Jamie said.  She gave her mother a kiss on the cheek and went upstairs to gather a few things together.<br />
<br />
Jamie didn't mind her mother being a little overprotective like that, asking her to call.  She liked the fact that her mother took an interest in what she was doing.  There were too many kids who had parents that didn't really care.  Jamie was happy to say that her parents weren't like that.<br />
<br />
She looked around her room for what she needed.  She grabbed a change of clothes, some clothes to sleep in, her toothbrush, shampoo, and everything else she needed for school tomorrow.  She had some problems fitting everything into her backpack.  Looking down at what she had, she decided that maybe she didn't need to bring something to sleep in.  She remembered seeing that Kylie had lots of oversized T-shirts in one of her drawers.  Kylie would surely let her borrow one, she thought.<br />
<br />
Now that she thought about it even more, she wondered if she would need anything to sleep in.  She stopped dead in her tracks at that thought.  Where did that come from she wondered?  Was she attracted to Kylie?  She couldn't say for sure.  All she had to judge from was what happened earlier in the day.  She thought Kyle was getting a bad deal from Jennifer.  But he accepted his change to Kylie easily enough.  He also seemed to be shy and considerate, the kind of guy with which she knew she had good chemistry.  But was Kylie's personality the same?  It had seemed to be.  The thing that bothered Jamie most was how she had stuck her tongue directly into Kylie's pussy.  At the time she wasn't thinking about what she was doing.  She acted on instinct, because it seemed that Kylie was in need of release.  But now that she thought about it, she liked the experience.  &quot;Uuuuhhhhhhh,&quot; she felt like her head was going to explode.  OK, she thought.  There's only one way to find out for sure.  Is that why I asked to stay over in the first place?, she wondered to herself.  Jamie knew herself well enough to realize that was exactly why she asked to stay over.<br />
<br />
She hurriedly stuffed the rest of her things in her backpack, ran downstairs, said goodbye to her mother, and rushed out the door.  She lived about 15 minutes from Kylie, and she now wanted to get there as fast as she could.  <br />
<br />
At 9:30 she rang the doorbell at Kylie's house.  Kylie answered the door with a smile, and said, &quot;Come on in.&quot;  Kylie told her parents it was just Jamie at the door, and that they would be going to her room for the rest of the night.  Kylie's parents said OK and goodnight, and with that Kylie and Jamie ascended the stairs to see how the night would unfold.</p>
