<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas Soulfang, an anthro grey wolf furry was looking ragged; exhausted as his grand cubs Dusk and Dawn along with his twin cubs Oliver and Paul tore apart the backyard with a snowball fight. The older twins getting bested by their younger twin uncles along with their grandfather; their make shift snow fort breached, the charcoal grey furred wolf cub and his twin sister, a doe-deer cub trudged back inside soaked from the snow coating their fur. They had to brush as much of it off outside with their hand-paws before walking in. Their grandmother Rachael, an anthro lioness fury helped to dry them off with a simple magic spell that dries the fur; helping to eliminate the chill the two cubs are experiencing.<br />
“Diner is in a few minutes,” Rachael speaking as she watches the fraternal twins Dusk and Dawn head to the bathroom; “wash your paws when done.”<br />
<br />
“Same with you two,” Lucas doing his best to keep his overly energetic cubs in line; the two white furred wolf cubs, panting after a rigorous romp outside. Watching as the two barrel after their niece and nephew; their tails wagging once they two got dried off with the same magic spell.<br />
“You look exhausted,” Rachael handing her mate a hot cup of cider as he sat down at the kitchen table; “the cubs clearly put you through the ringer.”<br />
“I’m so worn out,” Lucas yawning before sipping the hot cider; “I’m not sure I have the strength to knot you before bed.”<br />
“Maybe the chili that has been cooking all afternoon will re-energize you,” Rachael staring at Lucas; making sure her legs are parted so the wolf fury could get a peek at her feline entrance. Seeing his lupine rod begin to peak out of its sheath, Rachael smirked; knowing that her mate will most definitely rail her in bed later on. The Lioness fury collects six bowls from the cupboard and passes them to Lucas; “if you can get an erection from seeing my fury cunt, you can amble to the dining room table and help set it up for supper.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Dawn was sitting on the toilet emptying her bladder while her twin brother was washing his paws; the doe cub always found it fascinating watching him pee while standing up. Seeing his undeveloped penis peeking out of its sheath to shoot forth a stream of yellow water into the porcelain bowl. Dawn being the curious six year old tried to pee standing up once; having to spread her legs and squatting slightly, the stream coming from her entrance spraying all over the place. Fortunately she was in the shower when that happened and was able to clean herself off; the laughter coming from her brother soured her desire to experiment further for the time being. Sensing her bladder empty, Dawn grabs some paper to wipe before flushing; she sneers at her brother as he shakes his head at her for not washing up.<br />
“I don’t need to touch my bits to pee,” Dawn sticking out her tongue; “unlike you brother.”<br />
“It’s still gross,” Dusk growling in return; “perhaps I’ll tell mom you don’t wash.”<br />
“Do that,” Dawn shoving her brother to get to the door; “and I’ll kick you in your fury sack.”<br />
<br />
As soon as Dawn opened the door, both Oliver and Paul came bull rushing in to use the washroom just as they did.<br />
“Need to pee,” Oliver looking at Dawn as he tried to maneuver around the doe cub; Paul also trotting as he had his paws on his crotch in a vain attempt to hold it in.<br />
“Let’s go sis,” Dusk pushing her out the door; “unless you want to help grandma clean up a whoopsie.”<br />
“Fine,” Dawn looking as the two cubs sighing as they both manage to make it to the toilet in time; mildly jealous that the two managed to aim their streams into the bowl just as she closed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“Did you wash up,” Lucas looking at the six year old cubs as they sat down at the dining table; the table comprising of a brass frame with a half inch thick tempered glass top. The place mats on top of the glass and several empty bowls with spoons already placed.<br />
“Yes,” Dawn glaring at her brother as her grandfather entered the kitchen; her stare indicating that he was within striking distance from one of her hooves if he dared to contradict her. She never had a chance to follow through as Oliver and Paul ran down the stairs and climbed onto the chairs sporting booster seats so they could reach to the table. Seeing the two looking confused Dawn couldn’t help herself playing a prank with the impressionable toddlers.<br />
“Your too late,” Dawn grinning; “dinner is all gone. No pudding for you.” <br />
<br />
The look Dawn got on their shocked faces as they began to whimper was worth the unamused growl coming from her grandmother as she carried a large pot of chili to the table; hearing what the doe cub said, Rachael made sure that Dawn’s bowl was the last to be filled with chili.<br />
“Don’t tease your uncles,” Rachael shaking her head in disappointment as Oliver and Paul started shoveling the savory meaty concoction into their lupine maws; their intense playing outside earlier showing how much of an appetite the two have,<br />
“Don’t start without me,” Lucas coming back with a bowl full of warm bread rolls; Placing one next to each bowl before putting the rest on the table.<br />
“The two bottomless pits already have,” Rachael chuckling as she watches Oliver and Paul already have half the bowl polished off; “hungry aren’t you.”<br />
<br />
Dusk seeing no issues, begins to spoon the chili from his bowl; the ground beef and kidney beans comprising his first bite, the second having a mushroom and a chunk of celery. He puts his spoon down to grab the bread roll and ripping of a chuck before dipping it into to chili and popping it into his mouth.<br />
“Anyone need any drinks,” Rachael putting the pot down next to the rolls; watching as Lucas take the time to cut his bread roll and buttering it before he takes a bite of chili.<br />
“Let me get the drinks,” Lucas getting up; heading into the kitchen he soon comes back out with a couple of glasses. Placing them on the table he heads back into the kitchen and comes out with a pitcher of juice; pouring it into the glasses he passes them to each of the cubs and to Rachael before pouring a glass for himself.<br />
<br />
“There is okra and some jalapeno peppers in the chili this time,” Rachael speaking in between the slurps coming from everyone; “I also cut back on the hatch chili’s to reduce the salt and make it less spicy.<br />
“I think the jalapenos made it a bit more spicy,” Lucas commenting as he put a small spoonful of chili on the bread roll before biting into it. “Did you add sugar because it has a sweet taste.”<br />
“I think that is the tomatoes,” Rachael noticing the sweetness; “canned and fresh.”<br />
“I like it,” Dusk chiming in; “but it could be spicier.”<br />
“That can be arranged,” Lucas smiling as he gets up; coming back from the kitchen he puts down a bottle of hot sauce featuring a mouth with flames coming out. “Spontaneous Combustion,” Lucas grinning as he pours a bit on his chili; “not for the faint of heart. If you want some,” Lucas looking at Dusk; “don’t go crying if it is too hot to handle.”<br />
“How hot could it be,” Dawn looking at the bottle; the graphics not impressing her as she watches her grandfather pour a small drop into Dusk’s bowl and then Dusk spooning the sauce around before taking a bite. His stunned reaction after a tiny drop forcing him to take a big swig of his juice helped imply how hot the sauce was.<br />
“It’s made from one of the hottest peppers in the world,” Lucas putting the bottle on the table; “the scotch bonnet.” Lucas looking at his sons and seeing the fear in their eyes; remembering the time the two tried the sauce with their tacos and having to spend hours comforting them as the bawled their eyes out from the searing pain they had to endure.<br />
<br />
“If Dusk can handle a little,” Dawn reaching and grabbing the bottle; “then so can I.” Before Lucas or Rachael could react, Dawn poured double what she saw her grandfather put in his chili and then took a big bite without mixing.<br />
“Sometimes a lesson need to be learned the hard way,” Lucas smirking as he watches Dawn bolt from the table to get water; seeing tears coming from her doe like eyes. “I better help her,” The wolf fury getting up; “before she starts running outside to use the snow to cool off the heat.”<br />
“How are you handling the heat,” Rachael looking at Dusk as he could be seen eating the chili a little slower than before; Noticing him taking large bites of bread between spoonful’s of his doctored chili.<br />
“I never expected it to be this hot,” Dusk pausing to take a sip of juice; “it wants to stick around.”<br />
“Milk and bread will help absorb the chemical that is making you feel the burn,” Rachael passing the bowl of bread rolls to Dusk; “have another roll and use it to soak up the broth.”</p>
