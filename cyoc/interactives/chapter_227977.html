<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hungover, exhausted, getting hungry and starting to feel the chill; Jimmy Proudhoof was looking worn out when he along with his brother Jake, along with Edward Heartpaw and their father Michael pulled up the restaurant. Jimmy groans when he saw that the snow was a good two feet over the back parking lot. Even Jake sighed as he stepped out of his dad’s Saab; the suspension making noise as four large furies climbed out of the pre 2000’s economy car. Pulling up behind them was Lucas Soulfang who insisted on lending a helping paw; after the four came over and made short work of his driveway as well as the driveways of several neighbors, the anthro wolf fury wanted to help pay it forward as best he could.<br />
<br />
“That is a lot of snow for a back alley parking lot,” Lucas stating after an obligatory wolf whistle; “just exactly is where all this getting shoveled too?” Lucas asking as he watched both Jimmy and Jake wade into the drift and stopping a few feet in; they both had an exhausted look as they noticed a depression in the snow and went for it. Shoveling the snow away they locate a storm drain and both smile as everyone joins them.<br />
“I recall the other day,” Jake shaking his head; “what Dawn said to me as I was shoveling the driveway. Can’t you just magic the snow away?”<br />
“Tried it,” Lucas smirking; “noticed that the water pooled by the road and would freeze if I didn’t get it to drain away.”<br />
“I get what you are thinking,” Jimmy crouching down and placing his hoof hands on the cold asphalt alleyway access; his runes glowing as the surrounding snow quickly melted, leaving a roughly circular clearing in the alley that is devoid of snow. “Not going to be able to do this by myself you know,” Jimmy looking at everyone; “the water will drain into the grate.”<br />
<br />
Jake smiles while Michael and Edward silently head towards the parking area while Lucas and Jake take spots close to the street. All crouch and place their paws on the ground and magically heat up the asphalt. The snow quickly melts and starts flowing to the storm grate; steam could be seen rising from the ground as the now hot asphalt causes some of the melt water to evaporate.<br />
“That had to have saved us a good two hours,” Jimmy smiling at his twin brother; the antho stag-deer getting up, his hooves on now dry asphalt that has begun to cool.<br />
“We need to be careful around that grate,” Michael looking at the cast iron slats; “that gap between the metal is big enough for our hooves to get trapped in.”<br />
“Deer hooves are smaller than horse hooves,” a fury with a shovel coming up to them.<br />
<br />
Michael turns around and laughs; the fury in question was Carlos; a shire horse fury who had a glossy black coat of fur with and ivory colored mane and tail. His hooves were also a light coloring, though more yellowish white than cream.<br />
“Didn’t you take Rose home,” Michael recalling how the Burmese python fury leaned on the well-endowed stallion as she left the party last night.<br />
“And she is still there,” Carlos smiling; “I only just managed to escape her vice like grip. We were rutting like mad the entire night,” Carlos grinning widely thorough his equine muzzle; “thought I might come to try and dig out her car while she sleeps.”<br />
“We just took care of the alleyway and back parking lot;” Michael Proudhoof grinning; “Her car isn’t an issue.” The anthro stag-deer grinning; “you think she is the one? Your mate?”<br />
<br />
Carlos doesn’t answer with words; he just smiles as he places a hoof hand on his large sac; cradling the testicles confined within as he feels them pulse, generating more seed to replace the spent swimmers now occupying Rose’s womb.<br />
“She made several screams and cries last night that this sac and my shaft are for her only,” Carlos watching his mottled equine phallus begin to peek out of his sheath; “So I bellowed just as I blew my load, your cunt is mine.”<br />
“Yeah,” Edward Heartpaw smiling; he recalls a similar agreement he made with Julian after he became a fury, “you two are mates. It’s only a matter of time before you have cubs,” Edward eyeing the massive phallus as Carlos lightly strokes it to full mast. “But you might want to hold off rubbing one out,” Edward looking at the Shire horse fury; “at least until after you come back with your mate’s vehicle.”<br />
“Enjoy the next few days off,” Michael giving his line cook a smile and a nod; “we’ll see you after Boxing Day.”<br />
<br />
With the exception of Lucas, everyone walks back and enters Michael’s car; the suspension creaking as the four furies sit. Watching as Carlos gets in Rose’s car; they all chuckle slightly as he has to adjust the seat in the small two seater vehicle. Jimmy yawns as he summons his phone to check his messages; the deer fury smiles as he sees a text from Alison.<br />
“Hot soup waiting for us,” Jimmy putting his phone away; “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m hungry.”<br />
“I’m not going to say no to soup,” Jake speaking; his stomach also rumbling, the chili he had earlier not enough to sustain him till supper. “Plus I bet Brittany is getting bored being stuck with Alison and Denise.”<br />
“They have cubs to keep an eye on,” Michael speaking up as he puts his Saab into gear and starts heading back to his son’s place. He stops and swears as he sees Denise’s car; forgetting that she came here last night with Brittany and Alison he parks the car and gets out. “Jimmy can you drive my car,” Michael asking as he gets out; “I got to collect Denise’s beater.”<br />
“Why can’t I drive,” Jake watching his brother climb out the back seat to get in the driver’s seat.<br />
“I still remember the time you borrowed my car,” Michael looking at his son; “you killed the engine, remember?”<br />
“I was eighteen,” Jake rolling his eyes as he remembers his more youthful indiscretions; “you can’t keep holding that over me.”<br />
“You hit a pot hole with your stunt driving piercing the oil pan,” Michael looking at his son; “causing the engine to seize minutes later. I may have forgiven, but not forgotten.”<br />
“Think I’ll join you,” Edward getting out of the vehicle; “don’t want to be a third wheel in some sibling squabble.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t going to do donuts in a parking lot,” Jake grumbling as his twin brother drives their father’s back to his home.<br />
“I know,” Jimmy answering; “you wouldn’t do something to risk Brittany in having to raise Dusk and Dawn by herself.”<br />
“Now that’s hitting things below the belt brother,” Jake looking at Jimmy; the two practically identical save that Jake’s antlers are trimmed to a manageable four points while Jimmy has his growing still. Currently at twelves points and a few of them scraping the roof of the car; the other difference between the twins was Jimmy’s eyes remained blue when he became and anthro stag-deer fury, while Jake’s became brown. “I stopped all that nonsense after mom died,” Jake shaking his head; “dad wasn’t the only one hurt with mom’s passing.”<br />
The rest of the drive past in silence as they rode through the plowed and salted roadway; making their way to the residential block where Jimmy and Alison resided. <br />
<br />
Jimmy parks his father’s car in the driveway as Lucas pulls up in his with Michael following behind in Denise’s. Everyone getting out, they all feel the chill as their hooves and paws land on the cold ground; all quickly rush towards Jimmy’s front door to get inside where it is warm.<br />
“I gets cold real quick when you are not working hard,” Jimmy wiping his hooves as he enters; he pauses as he sniffs the air to smell an enticing aroma of garlic, thyme, chicken and other assorted smells mingling in with the soup he is smelling. Picking up on another scent, one that was familiar and made his cervine phallus peek out of his sheath; Jimmy shook his head as he knew that smell was that of sex. Seeing his anthro cougar mate step out of the kitchen; her belly swollen with a baby growing within. He gives her a lewd smirk as he knew what he was sniffing in the air; some of that scent coming off of her as he approached her with the rest of the shoveling group quickly filing in.<br />
“I leave for a few hours and you are already bumping uglies, despite being preggers with my cub;” Jimmy giving his mate a kiss as he places a hoof on her belly.<br />
“It started with Brittany,” Alison returning the kiss; “then Denise joined in. I mostly watched playing with my milk bags,” Alison hefting her breasts; “as Brittany used a strap on to work Denise into a sex addled lather.”<br />
“Must have been something,” Jimmy following his mate to the kitchen; “where is Brittany and Denise?”<br />
“They decided to have a nap with Junior and Roxy,” Alison collecting bowls for the simmer soup; “they caught us having our little romp.”<br />
“I’ll go wake them up,” Jimmy spending a few more moments smelling the inviting soup in the large pot on the stove.</p>
