<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They cannot.<br />
<br />
It figures! Just as you're finally getting comfortable with being in this form (even if only for a while) it seems that the world Genie has transported you both to has other things in mind for you.<br />
<br />
The ground shakes, knocking the dinner table over as well as knocking everything on it to the ground where plates shatter the utensils clatter.<br />
<br />
Both you and Genie stand up (the act itself almost impossible due to the quake) in time to witness a large fissure tear the ground open between you two, creating a massive chasm.<br />
<br />
You watch something fly up from the depths of the chasm that for all you know stretches all the way to Hell itself. That thing gets bigger until it flies to the surface, the force of its movement knocking both you and Genie to the ground.<br />
<br />
The quake stops but a creature that looks like a mix between a demon and a dragon stands behind Genie. The monster is easily three stories tall, its dark red glowing eyes speak volumes of evil and you swear that even looking at it beckons images of death and sorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happiness is not permitted here,&quot; the monster says.<br />
<br />
Its breath is putrid, its voice echoes throughout the woods. The hate that could sow such a creature is beyond your comprehension, at least in the form you currently occupy.<br />
<br />
Just as the creature begins to lunge at Genie with long sword like claws dripping with blood and entrails, you grab a small rock and toss it at the creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behind you,&quot; you yell.<br />
<br />
Genie rolls to his right as the monsters stabs at him. He leaps over the chasm and stands beside you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that thing?&quot; you ask. &quot;What does it want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay behind me,&quot; Genie says as the creature swings it vicious looking sword claws at you both. Genie pushes you to the ground just in time to avoid the claws cutting you both in half and turning you into a meal for the foul creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I know, I can wish it away,&quot; you say. &quot;Or better yet, I hate meanies that always have to bully everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature stands tall, adding another story to its height.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I hate happiness!&quot; the monster says. &quot;Whenever I detect it, it must end! I may not be able to consume your souls or turn you both to stone -- oh I would if I could, I love making people miserable! Death, death, *death*!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; you say, anger brining back memories. &quot;*Fuck* this! I wish for us both to be young adults that have armour and weapons that can kill that mother fucker!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wishing for things does not that them so kiddo!&quot; the monster screams.<br />
<br />
Genie grins. &quot;Or perhaps it does...&quot;<br />
<br />
With a swift movement of his hands, Genie surrounds you both with blue/white energy. You feel yourself growing older, taller and stronger. Knowledge returns as does power.<br />
<br />
Both you and Genie watch as the demon thing swings at you. But, the spell changing you both has given you temporary protection. The monsters sword claws disintegrate as it touches you and Genie. Of course it re-generates them but seeing its temporary futile efforts is still somewhat fun.<br />
<br />
When the energy fades, you and Genie are young adult otter people armoured and armed with swords glowing with holy energy. Genie makes an gorgeous otter man and you a gorgeous otter woman. Right now, any sense of worry over being female is absent. You have a job to do.<br />
<br />
The monster laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think those can hurt me,&quot; it says. &quot;Whatever, let's see what you think you can do. I enjoy letting people think they have hope and then watching as it drains away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genie leaps at the monster. The monster reacts with some pain as Genie slices into the monster's thick hide but still manages to slice at Genie before breathing fire at you, scorching the ground and making you feel uncomfortably warm. Unfortunately, Genie goes flying as blood oozes from three wounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, since when can you do that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
The monster laughs. &quot;I love making people think I'm small and weak. Makes it that much more fun when I kill them when they least expect it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You leap over the chasm to attend to Genie but the monster reaches out with a hidden hand (amazingly without the razor claws!). He grabs you and holds you close to his vicious looking face. You try to look away but the monster will have none of that and uses a claw to force you to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I'm done with your boyfriend, I'll use my powers to change you into my mate, brainwash you and together we'll spread misery across the land,&quot; the monster says. &quot;Oh, the death and sadness we'll bring! We'll paint the ground red with blood!&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel Genie getting up. How you feel it, you don't know, but you know that at least Genie is still alive.<br />
<br />
The monster screams as Genie sends a stream of holy energy into the monsters hide, causing the monster to lose its grip on you. Gasping, you fall but manage to jam your sword into the monster's hide, swing over the sword and throw yourself to the ground just ahead of the chasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn't think he'd drop you, or at least, I hoped I could catch you if he did,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it. Are you okay?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Genie holds his wounds. &quot;If this were a game, I'd be down a fair but of hit points but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence! Silence! No banter! Nothing to lighten the mood! I will only permit misery and hopelessness,&quot; the monster yells.<br />
<br />
The monster kicks at you both with his large clawed feet, connecting with both of you, sending you both flying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for us both to be impervious to falls and running into stuff,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You both smash through trees and crash into the ground with incredible force. The monster is on top of you both in moments. He grabs your sword, rips it from his body and throws it to the ground before melting it with his fire breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What'cha gonna do now otter bitch?&quot; the monster asks.<br />
<br />
You look at Genie. &quot;Can I wish for this ass hole to be dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No can do, that's against the rules,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, can I wish for a Gatling gun that fires holy bullets or something?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I wish for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; the monster yells.<br />
<br />
The monster swings at both of you with his razor claws, cutting into your and Genie's armour. Pain courses through your body, making you feel like sick and dizzy. <br />
<br />
Somehow, you doubt the monster feels bad about that.<br />
<br />
You see you're right when the monster laughs and follows his attack with another kick that sends you both flying through the woods into a large rock, causing debris rain down on you both. The monster is at the site soon after. He sees you both bloody and covered in rocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;An almost flawless kill,&quot; it says. &quot;Oh well, I've tenderized them enough. I don't need to eat them, but seeing me do so will upset people, so why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the rocks begin to move as your forms move. The monster watches as you both stand and the rocks turn into a rocket launcher. He tries to melt the launcher with his fire breath, but by then you've already fired a warhead.  <br />
<br />
Fire the warhead connect, detonating the warhead, sending a massive wave of fiery death in all directions, including the monsters.<br />
<br />
The explosion tears incinerates the monster's body. Somehow, you have a feeling he enjoys it for even his own pain and death is still the pain and death he lives (or at least lived) for.<br />
<br />
When the fireball clears, there's nothing left of the monster except for a few smoking giblets and bone fragments.<br />
<br />
You and Genie on the other hand -- you were clever enough to wish for the explosion not to harm either of you.<br />
<br />
Standing in the crater where the monster stood moments earlier, you breath deep and look at Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what the hell was that all about?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
Genie tries to smile but it comes out as a grunt. &quot;Just as we attempted to bring pleasure, others seek to bring pain. It is the order of things I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can I make a couple more wishes then? First, I hate seeing you in pain and being in pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it you wish?&quot; Genie asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first of all, I wish for our wounds to heal,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Genie smiles, nods, waves his hands and in an instant you're both healed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I wish to clean up this mess and bring back any innocents that died in that explosion; except the monster of course (not that he was innocent!),&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Genie repeats his actions. The remains of the monster vanish, as does any evidence a battle occurred. Life returns to the area and once again, birds are chirping. Though you don't see it, the chasm closes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, I wish for our armour to vanish and for a nice big bed to appear,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
It's all a simple action for Genie now. You soon find yourself naked and standing before a comfortable looking bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you wish to couple?&quot; Genie asks.<br />
<br />
You nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;All this combat, not to mention surviving it is making me feel a little -- Genie, I've never felt like this before. This has taught me that the end can come at any time. If it's all right with you, I want to know what it's like to experience love physically as an otter lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I have not enjoyed the touch of another for some time. As you might say, I would welcome the chance,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
You smile. The idea of doing that as a female may have been a little freaky to you before but after what you've both been through, it's pretty minor. The only question now it seems is, top or bottom?</p>
