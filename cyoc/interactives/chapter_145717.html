<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay Lisa why don’t you start,” Kellie said. Lisa gaped at the girl in shock. “Me?Why?”<br />
<br />
“Well,”Kellie said. “You’ve already used the ring before, this isn’t too much different. Why don’t you focus on useing your magic on Mary.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa hold up,” Mary Elise exclaimed. “Why does it have to be me? Why can’t she test her magic on you.” <br />
<br />
“Because Mary,” Kellie stated. “I need to unchanged in case something goes wrong so I can fix it. And before you say why not Katie I’ll tell you. Katie has the second most experience with magic so I may need her help. Face it, your low man on the totem pole so your the test subject.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise groaned as she turned to face Lisa. While Kellies explanation made sense it didn’t mean she liked it, especially if it she was at her rivals mercy. “So what are you going do,” Mary said with gritted teeth. “Put me in diapers? Make me old and senile? Shrink me to doll size?”<br />
<br />
“What no,” Lisa exclaimed. “Look I want to try something, something I haven’t seen anyone do before. Just, don’t get angry with Okay? It’s not personal.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Mary Elise huffed. “But when this is done I want a favor.”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded as she looked Mary Elise over critically, she didn’t want to harm the girl (even though the two weren’t on the best of terms). Still, she wanted to try something no one had done yet. She wasn’t sure if it was possible but she had a sneaking suspicion it could be done. Touching her pendant Lisa now began to focus her power.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise waited patiently for some sign of magic beginning to affect her. As she looked her body over she was puzzled why nothing was happening. Usually whenever the girls performed magic they would begin to feel something. “Maybe she’s not good enough,” Mary Elise thought. “Maybe the great Lisa O’Toole isn’t up for the challenge.” Lowering her head, so as not to be seen, Mary Elise smirked. Finally she found something besides grades that she was better at than Lisa. Mary Elise paused though as she saw her sneakers.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gazed wide eyed as her sneakers began to untie themselves. As the shoes untied she stared in wide eyed shock as the shoes unlaced themselves. When the laces were finally clear, she noticed the laces appeared to shrivel up before vanishing. Gazing at her unlaced shoes Mary now noticed her shoes begin to go through the same transformation as her laces. The stitching appeared to be unraveling as the tongue of her sneakers rolled back, partially exposing her socks. Soon though the stitches on her shoes completely unraveled,  opening up and revealing her black and purple socks. Like Mary’s shoelaces once the stitching unraveled the material for her shoes shrank and vanished, leaving Mary standing in only her socks.<br />
<br />
“You made my shoes disappear,” she questioned. Lisa nodded, continueing to concentrate on completing her spell. Mary Elise looked down, letting out a small squeak as she stared at her socks. The auburn haired teen could see a small thread now pry itself loose from her socks. As this thread became longer Mary Elise could see her socks unraveling. Starting from her ankles the girl watched as the thread snaked it’s way down her feet until she found herself barefoot.<br />
<br />
“Black nail polish? Really,” Lisa asked. Mary Elise frowned as she tried to cover her exposed toes. “What I was bored,” she huffed. “You think I. Going to paint them some girly pink color or something?” Lisa said nothing as she continued to concentrate. Mary looked herself over, annoyed she was barefoot yet amazed at the magic Lisa was performing. Her amazement was short lived though as she noticed the hems of her jeans and cuffs of her long sleeved T-shirt begin to unravel.<br />
<br />
“What the hell,” Mary yelled as she danced in place, trying to figure out how to stop this. “Your making me naked!?!?!”<br />
<br />
“No, god,” Lisa exclaimed. “Will you just freaking relax. This is harder than it looks.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise grunted in frustration as she gazed at her arms and legs. The jeans and T-shirt were unraveling in the same way the her shoes and socks had only moments earlier. Mary Elise watched as her jeans stitching vanished, slowly inching their way up her pale legs. The T-shirt was no better as the unraveling traveled up her arms. Subconsciously the girl now turned her arms away from the others, not wanting them to see the scars on her wrists from a previous suicide attempt. Looking at her outfit the girl was shocked to see it appeared she was wearing a short sleeved T-shirt and denim shorts. A T-shirt and shorts that were becoming shorter as time wore on.<br />
<br />
“Why the hell are you messing with my clothes Lisa,” Mary Elise bellowed. Lisa shrugged as she continued to concentrate on her spell. “Will you relax,” she sighed. “We’re all girls here for one and two it’s not like we haven’t seen eachother in our underwear during gym class. Besides, I don’t know why your so self conscious you have an awesome body.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise frowned as she once again looked at the remnants of her outfit. The sleeves of her shirt had vanished completely, while her jeans looked more like denim underwear at this point. Blushing she now tried to cover herself. Despite what the others said she was self conscious of her body. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Mary Lisa wasn’t finished. Mary Elise watched as the denim jeans continued to unravel, moving further and further up her legs. Mary’s T-shirt on the other hand was now unraveling from the bottom. Slowly the bottom of the shirt now rose higher and higher on the girl, exposing more of her stomach than she was accustomed too. Blushing a shade of red she didn’t think possible Mary watched as the last remnants of her jeans and T-shirt finally unraveled, leaving the teen in her purple underwear in front of everyone. As the final strands vanished Lisa finished her spell, looking at Mary Elise with a small smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“Huh it worked,” she grinned. “Always wondered if we could do that. Just effect the clothes and not the person.”<br />
<br />
“So you put me in my underwear just to see if you could,”Mary Elise bellowed. “What the fuck! Why do I have to be in my underwear?!”<br />
<br />
“Mary Cmon,” Lisa said. “Look, I don’t want to admit it but you have an awesome body. I would kill to have curves like that okay. And the purple underwear is cute too. I mean seriously, I had no idea you looked that great. You should definitely buy a bikini for the summer. You have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, you look fantastic.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise furrowed her brow as she gazed over her underwear clad body. She had her of herself as attractive. As much as she wanted to think that Lisa was just making fun of her, something told her that the girl was being truthful. She didn’t want to believe it but Lisa, her biggest rival, was actually complimenting her. “Um thanks,” Mary Elise whispered. “I um, never thought of myself as attractive before.”<br />
<br />
“Well you are,” Lisa said kindly. “Trust me, I’m not bullshitting you. You really do look amazing.”<br />
<br />
“Well um Lisa,” Kellie stuttered. “That was..um...interesting. What made you decide to try that?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Lisa started. “Usually the magic you guys use affects a persons body. I wanted to see if I could do something to what the person was wearing. Don’t know how effective it would be but needed to see if I could.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded, smiling at her friends. Her friends were definitely trying to test themselves. Hopefully the rest of the lessons would help them continue to grow.</p>
