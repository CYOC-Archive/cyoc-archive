<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of crashing dishes filled the house as everyone turned and looked toward the kitchen. <br />
<br />
“Amanda?” inquired Monica who had been helping by setting up the table in a small dinning room, she reached the kitchen to find Amanda on the ground her back against a cabinet with some pots she had gotten out to make soup for everyone lying on the ground. <br />
“Amanda?” inquired Monica again as she came closer, as the rest of the girls arrived in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Sorry…I suddenly felt dizzy and I fell.” Said Amanda as she turned and looked at her friends, that is when they saw. Her dark eyes had changed color, it was no longer a deep brown but instead they where a deep dark purple which seamed to almost glow somehow. <br />
<br />
“Amanda…remain calm.” Reassured Rose as she moved forward, there was no point in trying to avoid infection, they all had it. “I think you are transforming.”<br />
<br />
“I feared as much God in his mercy protect me.” Prayed Amanda, as sweat poured down her face, soaking her shirt almost at once. Her breathing was heavy but stable.<br />
<br />
“I read it is easier to deal with the change undressed.” Stated Lisa “If wings or a tail come in or if the body grows.”<br />
“Alright…Amanda we need to undress you.” Said Rose “Lets get you to the living room.”<br />
<br />
Together they got her to the living room, closing the blinds as they pulled off Amanda’s top and her jeans. Amanda was the most sheltered of the girls having grown up in a very religious and conservative home. Amanda didn’t own a shirt that showed her shoulders or a skirt/shorts which didn’t stop at knee length or lower. The only thing she owned which would have passed as sexy was her one-piece swimsuit.<br />
<br />
All this was kind of funny considering among the women in the house, Amanda had the largest chest of everyone. Amanda’s shirt was so soaked that it looked like she had just gone though a wet T-shirt contest. <br />
<br />
“Just relax Amanda.” Reassured her roommate Stacy as before their eyes Amanda’s already thin body shrank a bit as her D cups expanded straining against the simple bra she wore. Amanda winced as one of the girls got a scissors and cut the bra freeing the breasts which where straining against the fabric. Amanda tried to cover herself, to be modest.<br />
<br />
“Amanda we are all women here, don’t worry.” Said Lisa as Amanda nodded a bit even as her breasts somehow pushed up and firmed up as if she had a bra even without one. They cut off the panties as well leaving Amanda totally nude on the couch, her body still dripping with sweat as her ears became pointed and pushed out a bit through her hairline. Her long dark hair turned into a deep dark purple. So far there had been no hint of what she was becoming, the ears could have been a nymph or a succubus. They had seen photos of both with ears like that. Then the aroma hit them. <br />
<br />
It smelled so sweet, so alluring, like the smell just after sex and it was turning everyone in the room on as they began to look at their friend who was now nude in a different way. In that moment, four horns, two on each side began to poke out of her dark hairline. They grew pointing upwards as they hardened, the color of lilac. <br />
<br />
They all knew it then, the choir girl, the girl who wouldn’t show her shoulder blades or even her thigh outside of a swimming pool was turning into a succubus a sex demon.   <br />
<br />
The changes then swept down Amanda’s body, her facial features becoming more elegant and any slight fault with her skin disappearing as it changed colors from it’s normal pink to deep lilac color, which popped against the purple of her hair. Her lips turned into a purple as well, same as her eyebrows. <br />
<br />
“No…no…” prayed Amanda then she let out a moan, a loud moan of pleasure showing new slightly longer pointed teeth in her mouth. “Please stop…Please…don’…please stop.”<br />
<br />
This confused the girls until they noticed that one of Amanda’s hands was trying to hold back a new limb. Somehow without any of them noticing a long graceful tail, with a spade at the end had grown and it was now rubbing against Amanda’s womanhood giving her pleasure even as the changes rushed down her body.  <br />
<br />
Amanda’s body stopped sweating as it changed from pink to deep lilac as she grew slightly taller and graceful even as her breasts grew larger and her ass filled out. Her toe and fingernails turned deep purple as did her nipples and her hair around her womanhood. Her arms and legs shapelier as well. She appeared to be fully transformed, the only question was would she get wings or not. Some succubus had wings others didn’t. <br />
<br />
“Am…am I done?” inquired Amanda, her voice sounding similar but yet somehow more sexy. <br />
<br />
“I think so but I am not sure.” Said Rose as Amanda sat up and blinked multiple times. Amanda was still breathing heavily even as her hair fell around her face passing around her new horns. <br />
<br />
“What…what am I?” inquired Amanda as she pulled her hair back. <br />
<br />
“A succubus.” Answered Lisa as she pulled a small makeup mirror out of nearby purse and showed Amanda what she had become.<br />
<br />
“My God in heaven…” said Amanda as she looked at herself, then noticing that she was nude blushed a deep red and pulled a nearby blanket over herself. “Being a monster is bad, but a sex demon…I think I would have liked the nature monster better.”<br />
<br />
“Well fate had other plans.” Countered Monica as everyone wondered who would be next and how transforming into a sex demon would effect Amanda.</p>
