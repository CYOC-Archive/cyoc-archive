<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan unlocked his phone, checking the pic that his best friend Gavin had sent him. <br />
The large thick cock staring back, jutting forward from the familiar abs looked to be about 9 or 10 inches.<br />
“Good photo shop skills Gazza! ;-)” <br />
<br />
You fired back. There was no way the large thick cock in the pic was of your mate Gazza. You knew he was only packing the standard 6 inches, and that was the sole reason the two of you had remained friends, despite your obvious intense desire for each other.<br />
The pitfalls of being a size queen.<br />
<br />
“Nah mate. It’s all real. You remember Jamie, right?”<br />
“You mean Jamie, the arrogant bastard from the gym who hassles all us gay guys and brags about shagging a different bird every night?”<br />
“Yeah that’s the one. I dicked him :-D”<br />
“Nah mate. That shit ain’t real. Be fucking hot if it was though.”<br />
“It is real. Just hard to find the real info.”<br />
“Even if it is true, how did you get him to agree to becoming your dick, mate.”<br />
<br />
Long story, but bear with me bruv.<br />
<br />
First of all. Jamie didn’t know I was gay, so never gave me no shit or nothin’.<br />
So last Saturday, we played some poker and downed some brews, and he showed me the prove that he actually does land a different bird every day. The Smug prick.<br />
I was running out of money and he tried to get me to bet my phone. <br />
I wasn’t having none of it, but we kept drinking and then he went to take a piss, mid hand and I swapped out a few cards. Jamie comes back, and tries it on more time about my phone. So I offer a counter bet, that if I win the hand, he has transform into part of me for 15 minutes.<br />
We joke around, and Jamie fucking offers to turn into my cock if I win, because his hand is ‘so fucking unbeatable’ and I would be able to feel like a real alpha male for a few minutes.<br />
So I reluctantly agree, pretending that I’m calling his bluff, and when we lay the cards down on the table, the blimey bastard only had three of a kind. <br />
Now I had set myself up for a straight flush and let me tell you. The look on his face was priceless.<br />
At first he just laughed, but when I touched the ring my grandfather left me, he just went POOF. His body turning into smoke leaving his clothes behind on the chair, and the smoked whirled around me, all fog like before disappearing.<br />
So pull my pants down, and low and behold, my cock is massive. I took a few pics, then tried to get it hard, but was too fucking drunk. So I’m stuck there fondling my balls for a bit before I turn him back.”<br />
<br />
“You turned him back?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t interrupt bruv. I’m getting to the good part.”<br />
<br />
“So I turn him back, his body materializing buck naked,  and show him the pics, and hes right spooked. Turns out the cock I had looked just like his, but it looked bigger on me.<br />
He heads off, and I don’t see him again until Friday.<br />
Now on Friday, Jamie comes around, we start all casually chatting, I find out he has nothing planned for the weekend, and then Jamie tells me he vaguely remembers how good it felt being transformed for a few minutes. Saying he would be keen to try it again but only if I give him two hundred quid for his gym membership and some protein powder.<br />
<br />
So, I give him the money and then transform him right there in my room.<br />
Now since neither of us are drink, we can hear each others ‘inner voice’ so start chatting away, and of course Jamie brags that since he’s no fag, he ain’t gonna get hard from a guy touching him. I laugh at him, not thinking as I get my two hundred quid back and telling him if he’s lucky we might score a tight wet hole tonight.<br />
<br />
Now Jamie starts to freak out a little. ‘Tonight mate? I didn’t think you were gonna keep me as your cock for more than an hour or two.’<br />
‘Don’t be daft mate. Two hundred quids a lotta money, I gotta get something outta the deal as well.’<br />
‘Well Gavin. I ain’t gonna get hard for you while I’m your cock, even if its to fuck the tightest cunt in all of Bristol mate!’<br />
<br />
So now I’m all pissed off, so I put my plan into play. I open the package sitting on my nightstand, and slide the metal cock ring and cage within over Jamie, locking him shut.<br />
He says he won’t get hard, then he won’t be able to get hard.<br />
Now I spend the next two days mocking him and going about my weekend, Jamie getting more and more desperate. You see, Jamie fucks a bird every night. Getting his end off 2 or 3 times. So 48 hours without cumming is fucking torture for his over productive balls.” <br />
<br />
“But isn’t it also torture for you? He your dick now and he can’t get hard!”<br />
<br />
“It is a bit of a tough pickle, isn’t it? But I can manage. You see, while hes begging to be let out and returned to his human form, I’m asking him about it feels to be a cock that can’t get hard, getting him to focus on those feelings and describe them to me.<br />
<br />
So Jamie spends most of the weekend pleading about how his balls are churning full, and his head is pressing against the end of the metal cage, unable to get any friction. How blood keeps rushing into his shaft but there’s no space for it so he can’t even get a semi. His mind is getting muddled with thoughts of shooting cum, of tight holes and wet tongues, and memories that aren’t his.<br />
He’s too muddled to figure out that he’s got my cocks memory of fucking guys arses.<br />
And today, he’s been leaking. The pleasing quieted down as he mainly just moaning, his ‘inner voice’ reduced to short instinctive bursts. Leaky. Need to get hard. Need to shoot. Feels good leaking, taste  good in my slit. Slit dripping. Wet. Good wet. Need to be hard. Need to shoot. Need to blow. Full, Horny, full.<br />
He&#39;s been slowly chanting away like some cocknotized zombie, mate. <br />
So Just before I texted you, I popped a Viagra and let him outta the cage. The prick immediately got hard, although all the blood into his head, gave him some of his thoughts back.<br />
<br />
‘Gazza. Please! Need to cum! So horny!  Please Touch! Jerk! Thrust! Buck! Fuck! PLEASE!’<br />
<br />
‘That’s still sounds like a good deal for you. Being cock meat and all, but what do I get out of it.’<br />
<br />
‘Cock meat? My name is Ja-Jay. Cock meat? I’m not just cock meat am I? I’m a person. I’m not just a hard, leaky, pulsing, dripping…. Oh please let me cum!’<br />
<br />
‘Alright, but on one condition. No more talk about being a person anymore. If you ever want to cum, you have to behave like a good cock. A cock that’s always getting hard when I want it to, nuts bursting full with thick creamy nut, ready top shoot again and again. Deal?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes! Shoot! Again and again and again and again and-…….’<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, Gazza, you got me so hard with that story, but you skipped the part where you cum. Shooting his brains all over the wall and keeping him as your cock permanently.”<br />
<br />
“Nah mate. Do you know why I went through all this trouble for?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Do you recognize the wall behind me in the pic?”<br />
<br />
“No….”  <br />
“Wait. Isn’t that the alley round the back?”<br />
“Yeah mate. I didn’t call you because leaky cock meat Gazza might get wise if he realizes that I’m about to make him shoot down a guys throat. I want to tell him as he goes over the point of no return, hear his mind as he realizes he just sold his freedom so he could spend his life as a faggots cock, getting sucked, jerked and fucking tight holes. Tight holes like yours. <br />
So come to the back door and drop to your knees. I know your mouth is watering right now mate. I’ve got several new inches of cock to introduce to you mate, and I’ve been building this load up ALL weekend. :-D”</p>
