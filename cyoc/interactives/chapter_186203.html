<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I really need you to do this now Henry. If the corset doesn’t work I’ll need to return to the shops this afternoon and find something else. If we delay I won’t have time” <br />
<br />
“But I will look ridiculous in a corset. I’m a man”<br />
<br />
“I know. But if I’m going to have your tummy I need to know whether or not I can make it look like a woman’s tummy”<br />
<br />
Henry had a thought “Maybe I will allow you, but only if you let me off the deal we had the other day about making me hit off the woman’s tee”<br />
<br />
“But if you continue to hit off the men’s tee, we would be breaking convention and you told me that is a no no”<br />
<br />
“Deal or no deal?”<br />
<br />
“Deal if you let me have use of your body for an hour to try things out on? And a warning. I’ve been told that putting a corset on can be painful. Just remember whatever you go through I will have to do the same when I have your tummy, only I will have to wear the corset all day”<br />
<br />
“An hour but not a minute longer. And absolutely no photo’s. Then when we are finished we go swimming. If the pool is still crowded we go to the beach”<br />
<br />
“Deal. If my hour has started there is no time to waste. Let’s get to it. Strip down to your boxers”<br />
<br />
Henry did so, as Alicia sorted out her purchases. Shortly afterwards she wrapped a white garment around his waist, fastening it with buttons on the front. It was quite loose. “It’s called an underbust corset” Alicia explained “I’ve never worn one, but the instructions are pretty clear. I’m going to start tying you up. Pull your tummy in as much as you can” <br />
<br />
Henry pulled his tummy in and felt Alicia fiddling with straps in the small of his back. After a minute she said “You can relax now. Let me have a look” Henry had relaxed 30 seconds earlier and felt guilty. “Hmm it hasn’t done much” <br />
<br />
“I sort of didn’t keep holding my stomach in. I didn’t know you needed me to keep it that way”<br />
<br />
“We’ll try again. This time hold it until I say you can relax”<br />
<br />
Henry did. This time he noticed Alicia was a bit firmer with her tugs. It seemed ages before she told him “You can relax now”<br />
<br />
Henry could certainly feel the corset was tight around his tummy. Alicia allowed him to move across to the mirror so he could see clearly what she was seeing. His waist was definitely narrower. It actually made him look reasonably fit. “It’s got rid of my belly” he stated.<br />
<br />
“But not enough. I need a waist. I’m going to need to make it tighter. I think I will have to be brutal. Now I don’t want to hear you whining”<br />
<br />
This time Alicia released then tightened the straps one at a time. Each time she tightened as hard as she could. Henry felt like gasping but managed to restrain himself. Alicia had Henry relax after each strap was tied, then pull his tummy in again when she began to work on the next. As Alicia progressed Henry observed that it looked like he was developing something of an hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
Alicia must have got to the final strap. She looked at Henry’s reflection from over his shoulder. “Yes that’s looking better. But that bulge down below spoils the effect” She reached down to feel Mister Marvellous who was tenting out Henry’s boxers. “I see you are enjoying this”<br />
<br />
“Not particularly” he replied in his very feminine voice. “It’s hard to breathe”<br />
<br />
“Now you know what our great grandmothers went through on a daily basis. Okay I need to see if that is enough. Step into this” She held out a garment to Henry. He recognised it as one of Alicia’s skirts. It was the skirt she had worn on the first day they had played golf. He didn’t take it from her. “Well go on. My time is ticking away”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Henry had to ask.<br />
<br />
“To see if it fits. If I can’t do up the skirt, I will have to tighten the corset further. Do it!” She sounded very assertive. Reluctantly Henry stepped into the skirt and pulled it up to his waist. He felt rather than saw Alicia pull up a zip. It didn’t go up all the way. “Sorry I’ll have to tighten it further. Don’t worry You will get your revenge when you get to tighten it on me” She unzipped the skirt and it fell to Henry’s feet.<br />
<br />
Henry had thought Alicia was trying last time now he felt it a lot more. She was obviously striving to get Henry’s waist as narrow as possible. He did find himself gasp with a very feminine sound on more than one occasion. Alicia’s only sympathy consisted of “Harden up girl”<br />
<br />
The effort was worth it as far as Alicia was concerned, when she was able to zip up the skirt over Henry’s now shapely waist. Henry whined “It’s too tight. I can barely breathe”<br />
<br />
“Walk around. I believe you get used to it”<br />
<br />
Henry walked around the room. Alicia watched carefully. He was actually standing very upright. It looked to her that wearing a corset was improving his posture. She was also delighted in the way the skirt swished as he stepped. The corset made it look like he had a bum.<br />
<br />
“Okay can you take it off now?” <br />
<br />
“I still have half an hour left. I need to try something else” Henry saw she was holding up a bra. A large flesh coloured bra<br />
.<br />
“What’s that for?”<br />
<br />
“I need to see if I can get realistic breasts when we do our chest swap and whether the blouse I bought is the right size. And unfortunately, you have to be the model once more”<br />
<br />
Henry couldn’t be bothered arguing. He was already humiliated enough. He held out his arms and Alicia put the bra on him.  At least it wasn’t too tight. Alicia was now stuffing some socks into the bra cups. “Hmm you look a little top heavy. Maybe I should have just gone with C-cups” Henry didn’t reply. He just wanted this done with.<br />
<br />
“Okay now for the blouse” Alicia held out the floral shirt he had seen her buy at the department store. At least Henry knew how to put a shirt on He did up the buttons. “Hmm looks okay but maybe tuck the shirt in.” Clearly she wanted Henry to do that himself. He had to undo the zip at the back of the skirt he was wearing, tuck the shirt in and do up the zip on the skirt once more.<br />
<br />
“Well are you satisfied?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I am actually. You look okay. A little top heavy but if I ignore your head you would certainly pass for a woman. I won’t need to go back to the shop. Aren’t you going to have a look?”<br />
<br />
Henry walked over to the mirror. Alicia came with him. She was correct, thought Henry. His shape was very womanly. His head was male and his legs were hairy but the bra had given him breasts, the corset had given him a waist and the combination of the corset and skirt gave the impression that he had womanly hips. He conceded to Alicia “Yes I look like a woman. Are you finished?” He was actually embarrassed that he had a stiffy once more. Amazing in a way, as how could blood actually get down to the lower part of his body?<br />
<br />
Alicia had noticed but decided to not tease him any more “Could I try the wig on you? It won’t take a second and I still have 15 minutes”<br />
<br />
“If you take the corset off. I will allow you to put the wig on me”<br />
<br />
It was a relief to get the corset off and breathe freely again. Henry took off the blouse and bra as Alicia undid the back of the corset. As the corset was removed he instantly became a chubby man once more.<br />
<br />
But Alicia wasn’t releasing him until she had tried out the wig. She allowed him to watch in the mirror as she put the blonde wig on his head. “If the hair swap comes with your sideburns than they will have to go, otherwise it fits okay, Just stay there for a minute. I’m going to get some scissors”<br />
<br />
“No you’re not cutting my hair!” Henry thought his voice sounded screechy <br />
<br />
“Calm down Missy. I wasn’t going to cut your hair. I’m just going to trim the wig so it matches my own style as much as possible”<br />
<br />
It seemed Alicia only had nail scissors. It took a good 5 minutes to trim 4 inches off the bottom of the wig. “That’s better. I wonder if I can put a wave in it though. If so it would be a really good match”<br />
<br />
“You can experiment with your curler when it is not on my head. You hour is almost up. We are going swimming” Henry tried to sound authoritative. He actually sounded like an irate girl.<br />
<br />
“I’m done. Ahead of time I hope you note. Let&#39;s go swimming&quot;</p>
