<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Now inside the house, you see that things are still not different from when you were in the car. Sure what you could see was definitely different and so were the smells and sounds, but the fact your senses were still picking them up was still of concern to you. That one thing, that simple and small thing was no different. You could see perfectly down the short hall you were standing in before the foyer. Even what you could see of the foyer was clear, pristine and perfect. Not really sure of what was going on, you hurry into the foyer, running up the master grand staircase, down the main hall and into your very large and spacious master bedroom. Curious about yourself, you run headlong into the master bath attached to your room, wanting to know if there were any other physical changes to your head that was allowing you to perceive everything that you were. Looking into the mirror, you see that everything was as it should be, everything except for the five o'clock shadow that you maintained. For some reason it hadn't thickened or grown out, nothing about that was off, except for having one, when you were sure a few hours ago you were completely clean shaven, with a face as smooth as a baby's butt. Checking everything out about your face, closely inspecting you ears, then your nose, then your mouth and teeth, just to be sure nothing was different about them. You knew that your sense of taste was directly linked to your sense of smell and for that reason, you justify to yourself that had to be sure.</br>
<br>Being very weirded out by all of this, but not trying to keep your mind on things, you walk out of the room, heading toward the kitchen because for some odd reason, just then, you were feeling completely famished. When you entered, the cook you had on staff was preparing the items for breakfast looked at you, finding it was strange you were up at this hour. You walk over to him, looking him over as if to intimidate him, checking him out to make sure he hadn't slipped you something in your last meal. Freaked out slightly, the cook stepped back just a bit, trying to add some space between you two.</br>
<br>The cook's eyebrow raised slightly, trying to figure out what he was doing. "Sir... are you feeling alright?"</br>
<br>"Yes Eric, I am doing fine thank you! Why do you ask?"</br>
<br>"To be honest sir, there is something not quite right about you this morning."</br>
<br>"Yes... I have come to find that out about myself as of late. I do say though Eric, what do you mean by this morning?"</br>
<br>"Well... it is four-thirty in the morning and you are usually asleep still. Typically I am the first one to be awake in the morning, then your butler Mark would be next and he would always grab a cup of coffee before he made himself ready to serve you for the day or until you were satisfied."</br>
<br>You look at him puzzled, thinking he must have been crazy, as it was only ten o'clock when you left Cardiff and that was only fifteen minutes drive between the mansion and home. Before saying anything though, Mark walks into the room, right on time at his usual appointment and heads toward the coffee maker, not even paying attention to the fact that you were awake. You realize then that you were the one who was mistaken, especially when you look at the time on the coffee maker, displaying a time of four-thiry-five. As Mark walked back to head to his area of the mansion, he realizes that there were too many people in the room, other than holidays, and look up to see you awake with a shadow developing. Startled, his eyes widen and he stands in attention before you like when he was going about his daily duties.</br>
<br>"Sir... you're awake!"</br>
<br>"Yes Mark, it would seem that I am."</br>
<br>"Is there something wrong? Is there anything I can get you right away?"</br>
<br>"No... I cannot say that there is. If I need anything for the moment it would be something to eat and I am very sure that Eric here can accommodate me for the moment."</br>
<br>You look over to Eric who nods in agreement, Mark sighing in relief.</br>
<br>"Alright then sir, I will get ready post haste and come back to serve you."</br>
<br>"You know Mark... why don't you take your time in getting ready this morning."</br>
<br>"Why thank you sir... it is a relief to be able to go about my personal business as usual while you would normally be sleeping still."</br>
<br>"You are welcome Mark. Also, don't wear your typical butler uniform. Why don't you dress casually cause I am thinking that it is time to lighten things up around here. I just feel that I have been too stuffy with you two since you both started working for me."</br>
<br>"Well thank you kindly sir, I will do just that then as you requested."</br>
<br>"I must also thank you sir, but if I may, I would like to remain how I am dressed now. I am very comfortable in my chef's clothing."</br>
<br>"As long as you are comfortable Eric. Mark, I don't want you to dress casually because I want you to. I want you to dress however you are comfortable with because YOU want to. I am not to hold your hand and dress you. Be who you are and be comfortable."</br>
<br>"Yes sir! I will be on my way then!"</br>
<br>Mark quickly relaxes and walks off, now more awake than any other typical morning, but this was definitely not a typical morning at all. You turn your attention back on your chef, Eric, you walk up to his side and observe his work. Feeling a bit crowded, he steps off to the side to get more space, but you step closely next to him again. Wondering what you were up to, you watch his eyebrow furl, while he doesn't say anything. You sniff the air deeply, smelling something you never have before, recognizing it to be something other than the spices he was using for a mix to add to your food later. It was something new, foreign and intriguing. Sniffing deeply again, this time in a somewhat animalistic way, you begin to recognize where the smell was coming from. When you finally realize what you were smelling that smelled so exotic, you back away awkwardly, trying not to bring more attention to yourself than you already had.</br>
<br>"Sir... are you feeling ok?"</br>
<br>"Yes... I think I will be fine Eric. I am going to head back up to my room for the moment. Since I just sent Mark to go about his business for the moment, could you be so kind to bring up my breakfast when it is ready?"</br>
<br>"I can surely do that for you sir. What would you like to eat this morning? Your usual or something different."</br>
<br>Since things were different all around for you, with your senses and loss of time, you decide to do something a bit different from your normal cuisine.</br>
<br>"Eric... if I could, I would like a T-Bone steak and nothing else. Also, I would like that very rare, slightly browned about a quarter inch down into the whole of the meat."</br>
<br>Concerned with your choice, he wonders if you were sure you wanted it that rare, but he remains silent. "Do you want my special spice rub on it then, or would you like it as it is?"</br>
<br>"You can go ahead and place the spices on it. With things how they are now, I am sure the flavor will be like an orgy in my mouth."</br>
<br>You both chuckle as you leave, walking back to your room, feeling hungrier than ever. You think to yourself <i>Boy I hope he hurries with that steak. I am sure starving!</i> Walking back into your room, you sit down on the large bed in the center of the room, taking your shoes and socks off before putting your feet up on the sheets. You grab the large remote on the nightstand beside the bed nearest to you, pushing the button for the television to come on. As the electricity flowed through everything and a picture was produced, you quickly realize that even that was shaper than before. Every line was sharp and crisp, every color was enhanced and much more vivid than you remember it being last night. Wondering what was going on with you, you ignore what was on the television and think.</br>
<br>Closing your eyes and relaxing, your memory brings you back to Cardiff and the mansion with all the animal statues. The image is clear in your mind, watching it on your eyelids as if you would be watching television on through the screen. You watch yourself go up to the bear, studying it and then touched the glass eye. You remember feeling the shock from it, finding that to be strange, and then just heading back to your car right after. Now reflecting on it, things seemed as though it was right after. Watching it play out in your mind, you realize that the moon was in a much different position than it was when you first touched the statue. Not knowing why you didn't pay attention to that detail was a mystery to you. The bigger mystery was what happened to the time between touching the statue, getting shocked and walking back to your car. Replaying the event in your mind, like a DVD, you realize the moon was different when you felt the shock, meaning that a lot of time passed between touching the statue and receiving the shock.</br>
<br>Satisfied by the answer you found, but dissatisfied at the same time by the new and more mysterious question of the time jumping, you open your eyes to see the sun coming up over the eastern horizon, dancing upon the canopy of the trees grouped together in the vastness of the forest beyond. As the light filled the room, you realize you had been sitting in the dark all this time, with only the television as a source of light. It was amazing to you that you saw the room as if it had been lit. Now with the light from the morning sun, you could see the room even clearer than before, your eyes catching the sharpness of every corner abound and line that was made by each and every item. Even the colors were more vivid and vibrant, being full of life, a life that you never even saw or noticed. A new smell wafted into your nostris, making your mouth salivate, it was a mix of things. One you could place your finger on as the rare steak with Eric's spice rub, but the other was something new and strong. You were sure you knew what the smell was, as it reminded you of something, but you couldn't place your finger on it.</br>
<br>Eric knocked on the door, announcing his presence to you, even though you knew he was already coming. You realize you could smell not only the food, but Eric's scent! It was now obvious to you that the bear statue activated the more animal and primal side of you. How was a question to ponder over later, for now you just wanted a taste of that delicious and awaiting piece of meat. Acknowledging his presence and that you were ready for him, Eric entered the room. The smell became more intense, of the food, but more so of Eric's scent. For some reason, you were now consumed with how he smelled rather than the food. Not knowing what you should do for the moment, both being hungry and curious about Eric, you direct him to place the food beside you and for him to sit on the other side of the food.</br>
<br>Eric was very curious about what you wanted, but he sat there anyway as he was told. You paid him so he did as you instructed at all times. You grab the tray placing it on your lap, then grabbed the meat with your hands and gnaw on the meat, eating it like a savage animal. Eric just watches you in both wonder and amazement. Amazed that you were actually eating a steak that was extremely rare, especially since it was typical of you to order any steak well done. He was also curious though, why you were eating the way you were, yet he remained silent, just observing.</br>
<br>As you finish, he watches as you run your tongue over your teeth, licking your lips to get every bit of flavor that you could. For an instant, when your lips were open and your tongue was not over your teeth, Eric peered into your mouth, wondering if he really saw what he saw. You look at him, eyebrow furled, wondering what he was looking at.</br>
<br>"Eric... what are you looking at?"</br>
<br>"Oh... uh... nuh... nothing sir."</br>
<br>"Ok, I am not stupid Eric, I know you were looking at something in my mouth. Also, please don't call me sir anymore. It just sounds too stuffy for me. Just call me Brian."</br>
<br>"Alright Brian... I will be honest with you then. I was looking at your teeth."</br>
<br>"Why were you looking at my teeth Eric?" Your eyebrow furled again.</br>
<br>"Well... it would seem to me that your four k-9s are sharper than normal. Honestly, they look like fangs!"</br>
<br>You run your tongue over the bottoms of both sets of teeth, realizing that he was right. They were sharper and longer than normal. Placing the silver tray up to your face, you see a skewed reflection, but you could see that they were indeed like fangs. Just to be one hundred percent sure of what you were seeing, you ran back into the bathroom, moving your lips out of the way and observe your new fangs!</br>
<br>You stand in the bathroom, staring at your open and exposed mouth, saliva running from your mouth and dripping on the counter below, pooling slightly. Looking out of the corner of the reflection in the mirror, you see Eric walking up to you, concerned about you.</br>
<br>"Well... this tops the cake with what I have been experiencing already today. First were my enhanced senses, now I have fangs where sharp human teeth should be."</br>
<br>"Sharpened senses you say... well I can definitely see your teeth and they are now fangs, but they still look somewhat human to me."</br>
<br>You realize he was right. They were human looking, just longer and sharper than normal. You let your lips return to their neutral position and just stare at your reflection as well as his. You see that your shadow remained a shadow, even though it should have been longer stubble by now. Questioning that, you realize you needed to check your auto razor to see what the settings were. Sure enough, just like you remembered setting, it was set to give you a clean shave. You turn it on and the hum was even more audible than normal. Hesitating to put it up to your cheeks, realizing you were comfortable with the look, making you feel less stuffy and more suitable to your new found liking to comfortability. You look over to Eric, not directly, but at his reflection for direction.</br>
<br>"Eric... what do you think about this look? Do you think I look better clean shaven or like this?"</br>
<br>"Do you still want my honest opinion Brian?"</br>
<br>"Yes of course! I don't want anything said just to please me. I always want the truth from you and Mark from now on."</br>
<br>"Alright then. I think you look fine like that Brian. I mean especially if you want to have this relaxed and less stuffiness about you."</br>
<br>"Yeah, you are right Eric. Thank you!"</br>
<br>"My pleasure Brian. Would there be anything else from me for the moment?"</br>
<br>"No, not at all. You have done enough for me and I appreciate it. Go ahead and relax as you will. If I need anything from you, I will either ask it myself or I will have Mark find you."</br>
<br>"Splendid... then I bid you adieu."</br>
<br>As Eric headed out of your room, Mark opened the door and walked in, as he had always done in the past. It didn't bother you that he did that as before you acquired your less stuffy attitude, he always came in when you were getting ready to go over your daily list of things to accomplish as well as your planner, reminding you of important things you needed accomplished in the day. Mark nodded at Eric, who was carrying the silver tray by his side, as they crossed paths. Still in the bathroom looking your reflection over again, admiring how you looked with the scruff, you sniffed the air again. You know that Eric was no longer in the room and that Mark was. You find that Mark's scent was even more intoxicating than Eric's. You smile in the mirror, showing off your new fangs, trying to get used to the fact of having them.</br>
<br>Unsure if you were still in the room, Mark spoke up a bit, slightly louder than normal. "Sir... are you in here?"</br>
<br>You speak up as well, but your voice echoing slightly from being in the bathroom. "Yes Mark, I am in the bathroom. Please come in and stand beside me."</br>
<br>As you finished speaking you saw Mark walking in the bathroom, coming into the reflection. You were amazed by how Mark was dressed, realizing that he was definitely comfortable. He was wearing a loose and vibrantly colored Hawaiian shirt with a cacophony of flowers hat looked so real, upon touching them you could have been transported to the scene of the shirt. He was also wearing a pair of khaki shorts, showing off his defined and hairy legs. Mark was also wearing a pair of sandals, allowing the hairs on the top of his feet and toes to breathe. You notice that he too sported a five o'clock shadow, that was dark like the rest of him. You quickly realize that he was definitely well built, which you knew before, but with him wearing the clothes he had on now, you definitely could see all of his masculinity. Mark's upper body was nicely muscled, defined yet soft. His dark brown hair covered his forearms nicely as well, from his wrists up to mid-bicep. What you could see of his exposed chest through his open shirt, he was also nicely covered in hair there, accenting his muscular chest. Another thing you noticed about him, which you never did before, was he had a very nice tan, which added to his overall appearance.</br>
<br>"Good morning to you sir. Is there anything I can do for you at the moment?"</br>
<br>"Yes, actually there is Mark. You can start by not calling me sir anymore."</br>
<br>You watch as a look of dread and worry come over his face within the reflection and before he could say anything, you continue. "Don't worry my good friend, I am not firing you. I think sir just makes me older than I am, not to mention it is still stuffy."</br>
<br>What looked to be a huge weight came off his shoulders and face simultaneously. Mark sighed and waited for you to finish.</br>
<br>"From now on Mark, I would like you to call me by my first name, which is Brian if you didn't know. Second, I would like it very much that you be honest with me from now on. No matter what I ask, I want the honest truth. Can you do that for me Mark?"</br>
<br>"Yes sir... I mean Brian. I can do that... it will just take me a while I think."</br>
<br>You smile, this time looking directly at him, your fangs also showing. Like Eric, Mark looked at you intently, ensuring he saw what he thought he saw.</br>
<br>"I honestly don't think you'll have a problem with it, Eric took to it right away. Oh... and I know you were looking at my teeth. To answer your question before you ask it... yes, I do have fangs."</br>
<br>Mark sighed again, feeling relieved that he wasn't seeing things. Nor did he ask how it happened, as it was no concern of his to do so.</br>
<br>"Well then Brian, is there anything else I can do for you?"</br>
<br>"Yes... I do believe so. I would like to get to know you better. You have been working for me for the past couple of years now and it seems as though I barely even know you. If you would like, I would like you to just hang out here with me, as friends would and just talk. How do you feel about that?"</br>
<br>"I am fine with it as long as you are ok with things not getting done around the house today."</br>
<br>"This place is huge and you clean all of it everyday, ensuring there isn't any dust or whatever around for me to see. Now that I feel like being less of a stuffy snob, I could care less if things aren't dusted for a day or two. Especially so we can get to know one another."</br>
<br>"Sweet... I mean OK Brian."</br>
<br>You smile again, showing off your fangs once more and this time Mark walks all the way to you in the bathroom. You notice that he is very curious about your fangs, almost to the point where you knew he wanted to ask how they happened. As he walked closer, his scent increased of course, and you enjoyed how close he was to you physically.</br>
<br>"You know something... I never compliment you on your appearance. It is obvious to me that you take great care and pride in how you look Mark. I would like to look as comfortable as you do now."</br>
<br>"Well... how about we go and get you out of those stuffy clothes and into something more comfortable and less stuffy, eh?"</br>
<br>You nod as you and Mark walk out of the bathroom, then toward your large walk-in closet. Going through your clothes like normal, Mark didn't find anything that looked as comfortable as his clothes did.</br>
<br>"Brian... do you have anything that could be considered as comfortable to you?"</br>
<br>"Well, the clothes I normally would wear was what I thought to be comfortable, but when you ask me that now... no, I guess I don't."</br>
<br>"How would you feel about wearing something of mine until we get you something like mine?"</br>
<br>"That would be OK with me!"</br>
<br>Mark nodded as they left the closet. You walk side-by-side through the massively wide hallways, while heading to Mark's area of your home. When you entered the room, letting Mark lead, you realize how comfortable of a guy he really was. The room was painted like a beach in Hawaii. The eastern half was a beach scene with the sun rising into the vividly colored sky, where the west half was the sun setting and kissing the seemingly endless ocean waters accompanied by beautiful hues of pinks and purples. You were in a state of awe at his room, where yours looked like an office. Things were definitely going to change for you now, but how much was still in question. Opening the door to his walk in closet, you could see that the left half of the room were several butler qualified outfits, complete with shiny shoes and all. The right side of his closet were clothes that screamed fun and relaxation. He had shirts of all types, from Hawaiian to sports Jerseys. You knew you could learn a lot from Mark at that point and you were very willing to do so.</br>
<br>"So Brian, what are you thinking?"</br>
<br>"I don't know Mark, there is so much to choose from. You seem to know how to be comfortable and you know me as well as I know myself. How about you pick for me?"</br>
<br>Mark shrugs his shoulders then looks you over. "Well... I know your style and your size. Your size wont matter because I am bigger than you are, obviously. As far as your style... I can't tell cause' you are usually in business attire."</br>
<br>"Well just pick for me. It doesn't matter what you pick... I will be fine with whatever. I just want out of these stuffy clothes, I just feel too confined."</br>
<br>Again Mark shrugs his shoulders and begins rummaging through he clothes he had hanging up. Quickly going through what he had, Mark picked out an outfit for you. He had a pair of dark blue, low hanging jean shorts to start. Then he found a pale beige shirt with lush green Hawaiian fronds from a Hawaiian palm. Not being ashamed undressing in front of him, especially since you have done it before, you bend over and untie your shoes. Slipping out of them, you pull your dress socks off, finally allowing your feet to breathe after such a long time of them being cooped up. Next, you undid your pants, letting them fall to the floor and step out of them. Then, you unbuttoned your shirt and let that fall to the floor, adding to the clump already there. He looks at you nonchalantly as you stand there momentarily almost naked. There was nothing wrong with your body, but you weren't anywhere like Mark. Yeah, you had body hair like any man, but it wasn't a forest like Mark's. You had an average body too, nothing special, just average. Before your new look on life, you could have cared less about such trivial things, but now you know you wanted to be muscular and having hair like Mark. He hands you the pair of jean shorts and you slip them on, leaving them unbuttoned. Then he tosses the shirt to you, putting it on and buttoning it all the way to the top, then the left over fabric into the shorts, then fasten them as well. You stand there and look at him, arms open, silently asking <i>well... how do I look?</i> Mark didn't say a word or even shake his head in disapproval, he simply walked up to you and pulled your shirt out of your shorts while unbuttoning the top button and popped the collar for a more relaxed look, allowing the top of your new shirt to display some chest skin. Mark backs away, looks you over and gives you a thumbs up. You smile, still showing your fangs as if there was something else you wanted without really realizing it.</br>
<br>"Well... that is definitely much more comfortable than what I normally wear!"</br>
<br>"I would definitely have to agree with you there!"</br>
<br>You both laugh and without realizing it, you scratch at your chest nonchalantly. Mark notices, but doesn't say anything to you and you don't even realize he noticed.</br>
<br>"So what would you like to do now Brian?"</br>
<br>"I don't really know. How about we just go to the courtyard and enjoy the sun and the fresh air?"</br>
<br>"Sounds good to me!"</br>
<br>The two of you walk out of the room together, talking and laughing along the way, realizing that you both had more in common than either of you knew, outside of tastes in clothes. A few times along the way to the courtyard, you nonchalantly scratch at your chest, not even realizing that it was beginning to itch, little by little. Once out in the courtyard, you both bask in the light of the sun coming through the glass covered ceiling. Feeling hungry once again, since it was a few hours later, you decide it was time to eat. Once in the kitchen, you find Eric watching the television you had installed there when he first started working for you, since you wanted him to be available at any time to cook for you. Hearing the two of you talking while you walked into the kitchen, he stands to greet you, a bit taken aback by your new attire.</br>
<br>"Well... I see that you have taken a liking to this new you then..."</br>
<br>"Definitely Eric! We are hungry and we were wondering if you wouldn't mind making something up for the both of us?"</br>
<br>"Of course I wouldn't mind! That is what you pay me for isn't it?"</br>
<br>"True enough, but remember... I don't want you to be uncomfortable cooking if you didn't feel like it."</br>
<br>"Well I must admit, that is quite nice of you to do, but I work for you. I get paid to cook, besides I love cooking for others, so it is never something I wouldn't feel like doing. The only time I wouldn't want to cook for someone would be in the middle of the night when I am sleeping... other than that, I live to cook!"</br>
<br>"Alright then, I want another steak like you made last time, just like you made it... but I am hungrier than before so I would like two."</br>
<br>Eric and Mark's eyes widened, a bit startled by the order as well as the quantity.</br>
<br>"Brian... I don't mean to question you, but you are aware you can get sick from eating too much undercooked beef... don't you?"</br>
<br>"I am well aware of that Eric. I don't know why, but that is what I am hungry for and I think I will be just fine."</br>
<br>"OK, it is what it is. How about you Mark?"</br>
<br>"I will have what Brian is having, just one and cook mine medium rare. I will leave whatever else you want to add up to you."</br>
<br>"Alright... where will you two be for me to bring this to you?"</br>
<br>Mark looked at you, trying to figure something fun to do while you guys waited. "Well, for a care-free day... we will be in the theater. How does that sound Brian?"</br>
<br>"Sounds good to me!"</br>
<br>Eric nodded in approval. You knew it wouldn't take too long for your meal, but Mark's would definitely take longer, so the theater was a fine choice. You and Mark headed out of the kitchen, down the long hallway, coming to the input system for the movies. None of the equipment was inside the theater room besides the speakers, projector and hydraulic screen. You look over the selection with Mark and realize you had a lot of movies, some of which you never saw before. Mark scanned the titles with his eyes and his attention perked at one in particular.</br>
<br>"How about we watch <u>An American Werewolf In London</u>?"</br>
<br>"Fine by me and to be honest... I never saw it. I thought it would be a good movie to have in my collection, but I never took the time to watch it."</br>
<br>"You have got to be kidding me! You never watched the best werewolf movie ever made?!?"</br>
<br>You shook your head no at him and Mark grabbed the box, took the DVD out and placed it in the player. Before the movie started without you, you both run into the theater and sit down in one of the custom and very comfortable chairs. As you both sat down, the screen began to lower while the lights dimmed. You watched the movie intently, paying huge attention to everything where Mark just enjoyed watching one of his favorite movies. Half way through, where David locked himself out of the nurses apartment, Eric walked in the room with the meals prepared, just as they asked. You sniff the air, delighted by all the smells confined in one area. Not only were you delighted by the food, but for some reason you were happy to have both Mark and Eric's scents filling the room. As you notice all of the different smells combining, you become slightly aroused paying attention only to Mark and Eric's scents. Eric had brought a steak and potatoes to enjoy after he brought their food to them. Leaving the movie paused while the three of you ate, you continue to enjoy the savory taste of your food and the scents of the men around you. Once the meal was over, Eric was about to leave and bring the dirty dishes back to the kitchen to be washed.</br>
<br>Not wanting Eric to leave, wanting to enjoy the company of both men who worked for you, you look over your right shoulder in Eric's direction.</br>
<br>"Hey... why don't you stay?"</br>
<br>"I have my responsibilities to deal with."</br>
<br>"Come on Eric... I haven't done anything I am supposed to do today! Why don't you stop being a prude and enjoy some time to yourself, so to speak, outside of the kitchen?"</br>
<br>Eric sighs, knowing Mark was right and placed the dishes on the cart he used to bring the food to you and Mark.</br>
<br>"I guess you are right! I can sit and enjoy a movie with you guys."</br>
<br>As Eric sat down on the other side of you, he looks at you and smiles. "You know, I don't know what got into you... but I am really taking a liking to it Brian! I think I am going to enjoy it while whatever it is lasts! Besides, I love this movie... especially this part!"</br>
<br>"Yeah, me too! I think you will enjoy it also Brian!"</br>
<br>"Why is that?" Not really knowing what was coming next.</br>
<br>Mark and Eric spoke together. "This is where David transforms into the werewolf!"</br>
<br>You nod and shrug your shoulders. You resume the movie with the controls built into the arm of the theater chair. As the movie continues, you see where the moon is full and David is forced to turn. For some reason, while he was transforming, you paid little attention to all else, getting into the movie deeply. It seemed to you that you needed that change, that you wanted to be the freed animal like David!</br>
<br>When the movie ended, all three of you were sad that it ended like it did. You, above all, wanted to see the werewolf make it. You wanted David to be able to continue on with his life as a werewolf, even though he was doomed to be a vicious and savage animal. The three of you walked out together, Eric continued on with his cart, returning the dishes to the kitchen. Much to your surprise as you headed back that way, Eric came back out, wanting to join up with you again to do something else, not even caring what it might have been. Mark looks at you with curiosity, wondering what you three could do.</br>
<br>"Well... what do you guys want to do?"</br>
<br>Mark and Eric look at you, not really knowing what to do or say, as they were completely stunned your care-free attitude continued even till then. You look at both of them for a second as they continue looking at you.</br>
<br>"How about we just relax back in the courtyard? We could watch the sky darken and turn to night, as it is almost sunset. We should even have another full moon tonight... in fact its the peak of the moon being full tonight."</br>
<br>"Sounds like a plan, but how do you know that Eric?"</br>
<br>"Well Brian, in the little time I spared myself when I wasn't supposed to be cooking for someone, I spent it watching the stars through my telescope. I am sort of big into astrology."</br>
<br>"That's cool Eric. I think that is a great idea, don't you Brian?"</br>
<br>"Sure do Mark. It is kind of fitting that we do it anyway. It was last night's full moon and touching that animal statue that gave me this care-free attitude in the first place."</br>
<br>Eric and Mark looked at each other, not too sure of what was going on, but they had some idea. Looking back at everything; the scruffy face, the raw meat and the fangs all made sense when put together.</br>
<br>"What kind of animal statue did you touch Brian?"</br>
<br>"Didn't I tell you guys... I touched a glassy eye of a bear statue that glinted off the light of the full moon last night. I got some sort of shock from it and I started being like I am now. Weird huh?"</br>
<br>Again, what you said made perfect sense to the two. Being care-free, friendly, showing what you had been showing all day, was the perfect profile for a bear. The only question was if you were going to change into something else. They looked at each other, slightly worried about what would happen next, but they knew they had to continue or else arise your suspicions. Since it was the only thing they could do, they walked with you to the courtyard in just enough time to see the sky darken and the stars being to poke through the veil of twilight.</br>
<br>The three of you sit in the lawn chairs, laying all the way back, almost to the point of being flat. The twilight faded as the night took over, while more and more stars began to shine in the night sky. Mark and Eric knew that the moon would be up soon and they would see what would happen afterward. As time progressed, the three of you chatted about unimportant things, getting to know one another better like you wanted in the first place. As the light of the moon shone through the glass, beaming down on you, you began feeling a bit weird. At first, you thought something was wrong with you, but other than being a bit more aroused than you had been with Mark and Eric around you, nothing else was out of place. You sniff the air, taking a deep whiff of something new floating around the three of you. You realize it was coming from you this time, being strong and strangely intoxicating, but in an arousing sense. You look over to Mark on your right and you notice he smelled something. Then looking to your left, where Eric was laying comfortably, and you saw that he too smelled it. As the moon showed itself over the glass courtyard, illuminating the whole area in it's light you felt a bit stranger, not really knowing what it was.</br>
<br>Looking around, nothing about the two guys were different, other than the tents that were forming in their pants. Both Mark and Eric were apparently turned on by your scent, which obviously didn't bother you at all. While looking at each guy on each side, you notice the tent increasing in size, blood obviously filling every inch of their packages that it could. You knew it had to be painful as even your own stirred. A tingle came over your body, like ants were crawling all over your skin, and you scratched at your chest. This time, when you did so, you realize that dark hair covered your chest and your stomach. Just as suddenly, you feel all of your muscles spasm, not painfully, but just in response to something going on inside of you. As the spasms and tingling continued, you watch as muscle began sliding all over your frame, adding to the little bit of muscle you already had. The muscle continued to grow, pushing the clothes that were given to you, to their limits. The fabric became so taught as the last bit of muscle filled your body that the seams of all the clothes burst open, leaving you almost naked. On top of that, your crotch swelled until it was painfully tight inside your underwear and you wanted to relieve it, but you had no idea how either Mark or Eric would feel about it.</br>
<br>You call out to them, startled by your voice which was deep and gruff. "Mark... Eric..."</br>
<br>Neither of them respond, but you knew then it wouldn't matter if you whipped your cock out, as they already had each of theirs out. Mark was huge already, being eight inches in length and as thick as a beercan, with a thick and equally fat, cut mushroom head, which was extremely impressive. Mark couldn't help but to slowly stroke his piece of meat, being extremely turned on by whatever you were producing into the air. You look over to Eric, who was doing the same things to his equally impressive cock. He was seven inches in length and slightly less thick than Mark was. Both had their cockheads coated in their precum, easing their strokes, while neither of them paid attention to you. Taking your cock out, you see that it had changed. Before the previous night, your cock was a meager six inches cut, as thick as a can of Red Bull. Now things were different, it was nine inches and as thick as a beercan and three quarters more! You want to stroke yours to relieve the pressure, but the changes continue, making you wait. You watch as your hands and fingers grow slightly in length, each thickening up to the size of a hot-dog. Your fingernails lengthen as well, growing to a point while turning as black as a light-less night. Still watching your hands, thick pads develop on top of your palms. Not even realizing it, but when you look toward your feet, they too went through a similar change, changing into paws. Fur, thick dark brown fur spouted covering your paws, moving up your arms and legs, covering your crotch and balls, leaving your cock hairless. As the fur moved up your torso, the darker fur sprouted upward toward your still human head, meeting with your shoulders, while lighter brown fur sprouted over the bear belly that developed over your abs and up your chest muscles, meeting with the darker fur that already sprouted there. As the fur encroached on your head, you feel your face push forward, forming a bear-like muzzle, teeth sharpening and tongue flattening out, nose growing black, leathery and wet. The fur continued to follow the change, a light beige forming on just your muzzle, your head hair remaining human in appearance, fur continuing to sprout, covering your ears as they moved to the top of your head, while rounding out into a bears'. Feeling a wave of ecstasy induced euphoria overwhelmed you as your cock throbbed with blood, pushing it to grow much larger. You look at your straight and human looking cock grew to nine inches in length and thickened to the size of a forty ounce beer bottle. When your cock was done, your balls ballooned to the size of grapefruits. Wave after wave of intense arousal hit your cock as your short, stubby tail pushed out from the base of you butt.</br>
<br>As the transformation subsided, you looked at yourself in disbelief. Then you hear Mark and Eric moan, still stroking themselves but unable to cum. You felt your own balls churn with raging werebear seed, while knowing somehow that you were in control of their orgasms. You look at Mark lustfully, who was already a bear of a man, and quickly glance at your precum spewing cock. He knew exactly what you wanted, but was unsure if he could. Mark brought his mouth to your cockhead and began kissing it, coating his lips in your precum. You take a paw finger and wipe a gob of the clear, stringy fluid and place it in your mouth, tasting how sweet like honey it tasted. You repeat the process, only this time coating your bear finger completely in it and bring it to Mark's hungry mouth. Opening up for you, he tasted all of it, licking your finger and his lips clean. Suddenly, he began to moan and you watch as his body began changing like yours did, only adding to his already muscled, big cocked, hairy body. Knowing that it wouldn't be long before he was like you, you gave Eric a taste the same way you did with Mark. Eric was like you were, average, except for his cock and soon he too would be like you.</br>
<br>When they finished changing, you knew it was time to play! Mark wanted your cock bad, opening his muzzle to allow you entrance. Eric whimpered, wanting a taste himself, but you had something else in mind. You moved over to the grassy area, Mark still on your cock, you lay down and take his into your mouth. Eric still whimpering, you point to your tail hole and he eagerly begins rimming your ass. Sucking down Mark's cock was the best, as his was even bigger than yours. He was ten inches in length with a girth of eleven inches around. Slowly, you sucked him, enjoying every spurt of sweet pre that you received, keeping his orgasm from exploding till you couldn't hold your own huge load of cum back. Mark was licking so slowly, taking his time to each and every sensitive nerve, making you edge several times. Mark knew he was close to his prize as well as his own release, he went down even slower, sucking harder than he had been, till he was at the base and was beginning to pull back up, you lost your hold on yourself and your two bear companions. You opened your cum gates, emptying two gallons of cum into Mark as he emptied three gallons into you. You felt Eric cum all over you and himself, spraying all over his chest and your back, soaking your fur with the sticky, white, flavor filled juice.</br>
<br>Slowly letting yourselves come down off your sexual highs, the three of you lick your chops, getting every bit of cum on your tongues as possible. Eric just enjoyed himself cleaning his own spunk off your back. When the hunger was satisfied, the three of you stood up, looking one another over in all the bearman glory the three of you shared. You knew you had to have that statue and once you did, it would be time to give the world your gift, the gift of the bear!</br></p>
