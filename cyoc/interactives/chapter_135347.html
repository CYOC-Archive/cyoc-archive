<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Evan thought about giving into this persona, however, the spirit welled up inside him--warning him. Telling him that it would get its satisfaction one way or another, whether he helped it along or not--and so, it would be best for him if he simply cooperated. He looked over at Harry, who was now naked, and felt that familiar squeamishness rise up in his throat at the sight of him, like looking at naked men always seemed to do to him, like he was some fucking queer--and he hated it. He hated Harry, most of all, in that moment, and he thought of all the vile things he could do to him...but he held back and restrained himself. He couldn’t lose himself again, like before. Stay in control of himself, and maybe he could keep his wits about him.<br />
<br />
“You know, I just don’t think you have what it takes, Harry,” he said, the power twining out and around him--but not changing him yet, just...sliding a little bit of doubt and confusion into his mind.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about, Evan?” Harry asked him.<br />
<br />
“I mean, as far as recruits go--you’re a pretty sorry looking fucker, you know that? I mean, what are you, five foot five? 240 pounds? Decided to tuck into those doughnuts even before you got through the academy. Can’t fucking imagine how you managed to pass the physical tests with that sort of frame, but maybe the standards just aren’t quite what they used to be, back when I went through. They’ll let any short fat dumbfuck become a cop these days.”<br />
<br />
Harry tried to rebut him, but the spirit was too quick, warping him as Evan spoke, until the lean, muscled, veteran of the force had almost entirely disappeared. In his place was a short, stocky young cadet, fresh out of the academy, who had been given to Evan to train. The words...stung, but while Harry knew he should try and defend himself, and his honor...he couldn’t seem to make his brain work fast enough to come up with a retort.<br />
<br />
Evan just continued, feeling more confident, feeling his cock hardening in anticipation, “I did have a chat with Grant, though, about you. I always check in with him when I get a new cadet to train--and you know what he told me? Grant and I go way back you know--he paired me up with you for good reason, boy--he told me all about those special skills of yours you used to get through the academy. That sweet mouth and tight ass. See, we let the occasional faggot through, you know. Not many--they never make good cops, but they sure can make great bootlickers. You a good bootlicker, boy?”<br />
<br />
Evan put his booted foot up on the bench, and watched Harry’s eye go right to it. He knew what was expected of him--and he walked over, got down on his knees, and started shining his superior officer’s boot with his tongue--first one, and then the other, paying special attention to the bottom of the soles (where Evan reminded him he’d walked through dog shit earlier that day) and then shoved the young cub up against the lockers and fucked his tight ass, showing the boy what he could expect his proper place to be in this precinct--though he knew what he was signing up for, didn’t he? He’s fantasized about being a cop’s sex slave for as long as he could remember, which is why he signed up for Grant’s special recruitment program, after all. <br />
<br />
He came deep, pulled free, and made the cadet clean off his cock, before ordering him to get changed and out of his sight. Harry did as he was ordered, his own cock rock hard the entire time, and Evan knew he would be jacking off as soon as possible--these little faggot cadets were all the fucking same, after all. Evan went back to changing, and noticed that he had changed as well. No longer just a beat cop anymore--he was the captain in charge of this entire precinct--which is exactly why Grant had sent this pig here--he was just Evan’s type after all, and his last pig had finally broken down and quit a month ago. He wasn’t worried about them talking--they all wanted it, after all, even if the reality was always too much for them. Still, this one was...particularly eager--he might last longer than most, but Evan would grind him down eventually. That was his favorite part, after all.<br />
<br />
He was dressed in his street clothes, admiring his broad shoulders, silver hair and mustache, thinking about how nice it would be to get home for dinner...but something was nagging him. This wasn’t quite right, after all. He knew he should be remembering something...but he was so tired, and maybe it was easier to just finally forget. (will check 60%: success! The story goes on!) He did remember though--how could he forget? This wasn’t real, but his task was, at least, finished...and maybe he’d be able to avoid the same fate as before now, if he was careful when he changed back. If he changed back, that is.<br />
<br />
He...was important, now, after all. He had ambitions, and...needs. He could becomes someone even more important--he was attending a gala with the mayor and the commissioner in a few days, after all. But is that what he wanted? Thinking about Harry’s young hole...there were some young men in the neighborhood who could use his  If he changed back now...what if he did end up back with Robbie, or maybe even something worse? But what did he want, really?</p>
