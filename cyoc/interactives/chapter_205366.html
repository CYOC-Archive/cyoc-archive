<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;HOLY SHIT!&#39; you say in your mind, but before you can freak out, you raise your hand.<br />
&quot;Yes Evangeline?&quot; The teacher, Mr. A says.<br />
&quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; you ask, your commanding voice smooth and unwavering.<br />
&quot;Of course, go ahead,&quot; he says, before continuing, &quot;And then we can find the derivative...&quot;<br />
You rush over to the bathroom and hide in the handicap stall. (You know you shouldn&#39;t, but A. You&#39;re freaking the fuck out right now, and B. There&#39;s not a single handicapped person in this school, and you&#39;re on the 4th floor, where there&#39;s nothing but classes, so why would a handicapped person use this stall?) You pull out your phone, the latest model, and text your friends to come over to the bathroom you&#39;re in. You know that Ollive has gym class, and Rachel has a study, so they can come over and no one would care.<br />
Rachel arrives first, and knocks on the stall door. <br />
She doesn’t look any different than you remember. From her curly hair to her ambiguous skin colour, she’s still the best friend you remember<br />
“V?” she asks, and you wish she remembered the old timeline.<br />
“What the fuck?” she asks after a bit. “How?”<br />
“I don’t know!?! And I’m freaking the fuck out about it!!!” you say, before she grabs your shoulders.<br />
“Calm down, let’s think about this logically.”<br />
“Think about what logically?” Ollive asks. They also look the same. Deep brown hair, androginous body that could be either a femminine guy or a masculine girl. The whole shabang.<br />
You will them to remember, and like Rachel, they take a bit before going “What?”<br />
“I don’t know!” You exclaim, and say, “I just filled out these cards, and then, when I was done, I looked like this!”<br />
“Ok,” they say, “Let’s look at this logically. Did anyone else freak out?”<br />
“Just you two,” you say, “And I think I know why; there was this question near the end, it said ‘Who would you like to remember the old reality as well.’ I picked you two.”<br />
“Ok, first off, thanks, and second off, Do you think you can survive until tonight?” Ollive says, “We can figure this out later, at one of our houses.”<br />
“Can it be her’s?” Rachel asks, “No offence; but your house is crowded, and mine is too small. Also,” She says, turning to you, “I kinda want to explore it.”<br />
“Sure…” you say, calming down, “I hope you guys remember how?”<br />
“Of course,” Ollive says, “But I have a question.”<br />
“Ask away,” you say, standing up. “This is so weird. I’m so tall!” <br />
“Look at all this hair!” Rachel says, “It looks so much better than I remember. Olli, come take a look at this!” Rachel fawns over your hair for a bit, before Ollive clears their throat.<br />
“Do you want us to call you V, with She Her pronouns, or /bhjfbghjekrghjkrbfmhw,ahl\, with He Him pronouns?”<br />
“What was that second one?” you ask, “It sounded like white noise.”<br />
Both of them start saying… something at you. It sounds like nothing but white noise. You think back to your memories, and realise you can’t remember your name.<br />
“I… I can’t understand it. It sounds like white noise…” you say, “Just call me V.”<br />
“Alright. Are we going home with you, or?” Ollive asks, before Rachel pulls them over and whispers something in their ear.<br />
“Nevermind, does 3 work?”<br />
“Yeah,” you say confused. “But why not all go together?”<br />
“Don’t worry about that. Just survive this Friday.”<br />
You go back to your class, and spend the day waiting for school to end.<br />
What you don’t realise, is that Noelle, the sweet, sheltered girl, has a massive crush on you. You sit down for lunch, a nice sandwich with a boxed salad. Rachel and Ollive sit down with you, and you decide to not discuss your… predicament, at lunch. <br />
`Oh my god, she’s sitting at the next table over!’ Noelle thinks, staring at your ass. She catches herself, and thinks, ‘No no no, don’t think about that. Don’t think about it.’<br />
You leave the cafeteria afterwards, and head into science class, followed by Noelle. You two are sitting in the opposite corner of the room from each other, all the better for Noelle to sneak peeks at you when neither of you are paying attention. She always catches herself mid look, and completely denies ever doing it. Mostly to herself. <br />
The science class goes well enough. Miss De Vana, your science teacher, assigns a group project for 4 people. You and your friends get in a group together, but “You cannot have the group of only 3 people, even if one of you is excelentaes student…” according to Miss De Vana. She looks over her classroom, and sees all the smart students grouping up. All 5 of them. <br />
“No no no!” De Vana exclaims, “You cannot have the group with 5 people either. One of the 5 group will have to join the 3 group.”<br />
At everyone’s shock, Noelle stands up, and walks over to your group. “Um, uh… I’d like to change groups, if that’s available.” the thought ‘What am I doing?’ fills her head, as Miss De Vanna nods in agreement, and Noelle walks over. <br />
“Don’t worry, I got it,” You say, before fucking deadlifting a desk with one hand. You move it over to your group, and Noelle sits down. “T-t-thank y-y-you…” she stutters, her heart beating out of her chest.<br />
“Don’t worry,” you say, and your voice makes her even redder, even though you don’t realise it. “Helping cute girls is what I exercise for~” you tease, and she makes a weird noise.<br />
“V, dude, give the poor girl some space!” Rachel says, “The poor girl looks like she’s going to explode!”<br />
You look over to her, your piercing eyes examining her. Her soft, dark brown hair cascades down her shoulders, reaching mid-back. Her oval face is very pretty, a light smacking of freckles dot her pale cheeks, and her forest green eyes are wide in surprise. Her cheeks, ears, and button nose are bright red; you swear that, if you turned out the lights, her nose would glow. She has a very lithe body, from her frequent running. Her knit sweater, long sleeved blouse, and long skirt hide any ‘finer’ details, but her soft delicate hands go to hide her face.<br />
“She didn’t mean it literally,” Ollive says, and you start discussing the group project. You end up going with a mix of Rachel’s and Noelle’s ideas: a Dress… wait for it… With Pockets! <br />
“How revolutionary,” Ollive snarks, “I do admit, it may actually work. It’ll be better than baking soda volcanoes, or cardboard boats.”<br />
“So, um, how are we going to work on it?” Noelle asks.<br />
“Oh, right… You’re on the track team, right?” Rachel asks, “Do they have an event tonight?” The dismissal bell rings, and Noelle responds, “No, why?”<br />
“Oh, we were going to meet at V’s house tonight. I guess we could continue this conversation there.”<br />
There’s a pregnant pause, as you debate on the pros and cons. During this, Noelle is at war with herself. Half of her, the half that’s in control most of the time, the one that’s the prim and proper upper middle class christian pure girl, is saying no. That this would be improper, and that she needs to leave, being near you is giving her dangerous thoughts. The other half, the one fed by said dangerous thoughts, the one that she’s fought her entire life to hide, the one that begs her to be true to herself, is screaming YES! The one who’s saying to hug you, try to suck up all of that intoxicating honey orange smell you emit. The one who’s heard, and desperately wants to be true, the rumour that Marie, the only person that’s ever experienced your ministrations, has spread. The part of her that her Mom has tried her best to kill, and her dad has tried his best to save. The part that has a hidden romance novel, which to anyone else, would be the most cutesy, childish, “girls can like other girls” fluff, but to her, it’s as explicit as a porn mag.<br />
“Yeah sure, you can come over,” you say, unaware of the internal war that’s waging inside of Noelle. “So long as you can?”<br />
“Yes. Yes. I’ll go. Do that. Give me a second?” Noelle says, holding her phone. While you were debating the pros and cons, your other friends went home. They’ll be over in an hour.</p>
