<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The software was extremely versatile and tended to fill in the blanks where specifics were not given, so it was relatively quick to enter the new settings- Scott had barely finished his pipe.<br />
<br />
Scott said in his new, gruffer voice, &quot;Do you think it will hurt, me being awake this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it didn't hurt when you did it to me; it just felt funny, but somehow 'right' at the same time,&quot; replied Doug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, go ahead then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug clicked the button that would make the changes; he had configured it to take approximately twenty minutes for the transformation.  He didn't want it to be so quick that they couldn't enjoy the process, but was too eager to make it too slow..<br />
<br />
They stood a few feet apart from eachother, both of them inspecting Scott for the changes.  The cloned boy stood to the side, dazed and blank.<br />
<br />
A momentary pang of nausea filled Scott, as though he had eaten more than he should have by far.  Moments later the nausea waned into a feeling of sated hunger, a pleasant, calm feeling that made Scott feel as though he could use a nap.  Looking down he saw that his already farly substantial gut already looked a little larger, swelling with each breath he took.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes passed like this, and then the changes began to accelerate.  Scott's legs began to thicken with muscle, forcing him to widen his stance as a comfortable layer of soft meat encased his legs.  The legs were disproportionate to the rest of his body, and the two realized simultaneously that this was in preparation for the changes still to come.<br />
<br />
Abruptly, Scott began to grow.  His wider stance had at first made him appear shorter than he was, and Doug wondered, vaguely, whether this would be taken into account when he reached his final height.  He suspected that the program, being extremely flexible in its parameters, would arrange for Scott's height to reach 8 foot even after the wider stance was considered.  He realized that he may have underestimated the true girth to which Scott would grow.<br />
<br />
Scott's fairly hairy chest and arms began to extend and elongate, becoming thinner as the mass was distributed along their greater length.  The tree trunk legs grew longer as well, forcing his stance to be adjusted again, but they were even now growing wider.  He had surpassed 7 ft tall and was still growing.<br />
<br />
Scott began to take the shape of an ex-basketball player, his limbs and neck stretching ever longer, becoming leaner as his meat was spread along them.  His height was now beginning to near its final 8 ft mark, but his build, while still impressive, was disappointing given the girth the pair had expected.<br />
<br />
As the growth slowed to a stop, however, other changes began, and he began to expand.  Scott let out a deep groan as the feeling of stretching enveloped him.  His arms were the most noticable.  His biceps swelled up first as though he had a pump after a hard workout, and then further still, veins crawling over them in a frenzied attempt to feed blood to his extremities.  His forearms became as large as his enhanced calves had been before, and then some.  He flexed to test them and found that his movements were hindered somewhat by the muscle mass accumulating on his arms, and he wasn't able to fold his arm much further than 90 degrees.<br />
<br />
His attention being drawn by his arms, Scott had missed the activity on his chest, while Doug had been dutifully observing it.  His pecs had swollen up beyond what was reasonable, and was starting to block his view downward.  Although they had pushed outwards, the specifications of the program had intended him to be thick, and so his chest and back had mostly expanded to the sides, flaring out in an incredible display of power.  His arms were pushed up several degrees by the bulging mass.<br />
<br />
His neck had previously grown longer to contribute to his overall larger height, and had looked skinny compared to the rest of him.  Muscles, however, were now surging through it, making his neck look just as vascular and well-defined as the rest of his body.  Scott looked like a heavyweight bodybuilder as the changes slowed to a stop.<br />
<br />
Doug and Scott exchanged a look as the changes seemed to have stopped; silently, they acknowledged together that more was still to come.  Scott reached down absently to scratch his belly and discovered that it was, yet again, somewhat larger than before.  Placing his palm on his stomach he could feel it swelling to larger sizes even as it firmed and became a hard ball.<br />
<br />
Doug had a better view of this stage as he could see Scott's body in its entirety.  A thin layer of fat had begun to accumulate over Scott's entire body, but it was increasing by the second.  Within a minute, his cut chest had become a little padded, and the veins on his arms had been hidden by the extra padding.  His legs grew a little wider and softened a bit, and his stance was forced even lower.  Doug had thoguht Scott had been a touch over the 8 ft he'd specified.<br />
<br />
Scott's chest ballooned outwards and his once well-defined pectorals seemed to show a little more age, becoming saggy but still firm man tits.  The thickening of his arms had forced them even straighter, as his build went from Popeye to Bluto.  His chiseled calves became thick, softer pistons upon which his weight rested.  His neck lost its appearance of hypermusculature and took on the look of a football linebacker.<br />
<br />
The changes slowed again, as though the program were taking a deep breath for the next part, but it was clear that the most strenuous portion of the changes were done.  Scott took a few steps around in a circle, feeling his new heft, and discovering that despite his enhanced strength he was still forced by his sheer size into a slight waddle.  Nobody would mistake him, however, with his huge barrel chest, of being obese; he was simply a man who enjoyed his muscles and enjoyed his meals.<br />
<br />
The changes now were at once less physically dramatic andsomehow, more so.  His already fair covering of hair began to thicken impressively, his legs becoming a dark brown thicket of hair.  The hair on his stomach thickened and lengthened, and the skin of his chest was rapidly being hidden by the forest of hair curling over them. <br />
<br />
Hair progressed visibly down his massive arms, and Scott worried for a moment that he'd end up looking like an animal.  The growth stopped quickly, however, leaving him with a short but very thick coat of wiry hair.  His hands, which he had only just noticed had grown with the rest of him, sporting very thick meaty fingers, grew a coating of hair on their backs and at each knuckle, completing his body's look.<br />
<br />
There was an instanteous, dull moment of pain on his scalp, and Scott found that a substantial portion of his hair fell out, mid-step, being left behind him.  He took a meaty paw to his head and stroked it backward, clearing away the fallen hair, and leaving behind a shiny dome.  He was definitely balding, but his hairline came just short of the top of his head.  The surviving hair was surprisingly thin and wispy, in contrast to his body hair but fitting for his new look overall.<br />
<br />
He glanced in a nearby mirror, something he'd kept from doing to this point so he could experience the changes first hand, and decided that he liked the new look, though it made him look considerably older than he was.  That would soon change he realized.<br />
<br />
His brown moustache and beard retreated into his face almost instantly, leaving him suddenly bare in the face.  His alarm was misplaced however, as almost as soon as this was finished he watched his face begin to weather.  Very short bristles of stubble began to appear on his face, like a teenager's first attempts at a beard.<br />
<br />
They did not grow longer, but instead seemed to multiply on his face.  The whiskers spead down to his chest, filled in between the moustache and sideburns, and then grew up towards his eyes.  The stubble thickened bravely, and his face took on a darker shade, then became bluish grey with the tint of the stubble, then even darker.  Apparently satisfied with the density of his new beard, the program moved on to length, and his beard began to grow in earnest.<br />
<br />
For a few seconds scott looked, with his youngish face, like a model with designer stubble.  Then he looked like he had forgotten to shave for a couple days.  Then he looked like he'd taken a short vacation, and then a longer one.  Before long his beard was clearly no longer accidental and instead one grown with purpose.  It grew, completely hiding his face from view, until it was just about an inch long, then stopped.<br />
<br />
It seemed to Scott that the twenty minutes was up.  &quot;Is that it?&quot; he asked Doug.  &quot;I thought there was..&quot; his sentence was caught in his throat with sudden, strange feelings coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
Doug quickly asked, &quot;What's wrong?&quot; looking at the strange expression on his new friend's face.  Scott was unable to reply but Doug got his answer, as Scott's body began the march from late twenties to late forties.  Scott's hands grew calloused and rugged, his forehead became weathered and his scalp, white where his hair had fallen out, took a tan that matched the rest of his body, making it impossible to tell that he had only been bald for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
A few wrinkles appeared at his eyes, and his chest hair seemed to ruffle briefly as it became paler, then paler still, drifting towards a dark grey color, while the rest of his body hair maintained its dark black.<br />
<br />
His beard, which Doug now noticed was black rather than the brown it'd been before, paled only slightly all over.  Then, streaks of grey seemed to course through his moustache, which at this point hid his mouth from view, and his goatee.  Flecks of white began to pepper his beard, the individual hairs just suddenly flipping from black to white.<br />
<br />
His hairline crawled up a bit more, but not much; it seemed that this new Scott started balding early in life but wouldn't ever lose all his hair.  A splash of grey decorated his temples as the creases in his forehead became exaggerated.  Scott's stance sagged slightly as he reached his destination at 46 years old.<br />
<br />
Once again the changes coasted to a stop giving Doug and Scott a moment to appreciate the new look.  Doug said, &quot;You look great!  But this is only the physical.  There's a few things left..&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott just grinned and waited, but not for long.</p>
