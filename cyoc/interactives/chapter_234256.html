<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica Smith was the classic milf, thin waist, with wide hips and a large bust, she&#39;d aged gracefully, having worked hard to keep that shape. This said, her personality was as toxic as they come, spiteful and angry, she would nag at her family for any small indiscretion, she took disagreements as personal slights, and started drama at the office. All of this was calculated for Kayla&#39;s changes, and while Jessica wouldn&#39;t be a burden on her family, she was now Kayla&#39;s problem.<br />
<br />
Kayla was forced to walk out to the front of the house by the curse, then turned to face the two mothers talking on the porch. Time seemed to freeze as Jen walked onto the porch to watch the show, and in an instant Jessica and Jen were changed. The new Mrs. Smith, Cassandra, sat in the exact position that the old Mrs. Smith had been frozen in, Jen had grown a foot, and now had blonde hair with dark roots, an improvement over her bleach blonde look. Kayla looked down and saw that she was shorter, the body beneath her bustier than her old one, she reach up and cupped one of her new breasts when, like a hiccup, her body lurch up by a foot.<br />
<br />
Kayla felt as her body rapidly bounced with each hiccup motion, gaining a foot in height as it did, she felt the clothes she had dressed in quickly become very tight, not having the time to strip, they started to tear as she reached ten feet tall and continued to grow. She started to panic, trying to push herself off of the growing giantess she was fused to. Unable to get away as she hit sixteen feet she gave up on trying to push herself away and started pleading with the body to stop, whimpering as it continued to twenty feet, screaming as it hit twenty five with showing no signs of stopping, the curse piled on it&#39;s previous owners sins, making them Kayla&#39;s burden to bare.<br />
<br />
She watched as the ground got further and further away, she felt the ever growing body below in all it&#39;s glory, a light breeze sent a shiver up her backs, the growing finally stopped, Kayla hesitantly looked down and yelped. Her new milfy lower half was now thirty feet tall at the shoulder, while an astounding height, it wasn&#39;t as gigantic as she could have been, and she was now eye level with most of the eves of the second floor roofs of the houses around her, and eye level with the tops of telephone poles near her. Time started up again as Jen laughed and entered her house, leaving Kayla with a new giantess to deal with under her waist. She didn&#39;t have the time to do anything when her mother called her.<br />
<br />
“Kayla? Did you get the upper roof as well?” She shouted up to her.<br />
<br />
“I was just about to get that! I did the lower ones first!” Kayla shouted down, and found herself awkwardly walking over to the house, each foot fall was a thud, like a firework going off, but her trail leaving little damage to the earth but an imprint in the grass. She bent over to continue cleaning, her now massive lower half doing all the work, gently using one fingernail to scoop out the gutters and remove the dead leaves from the roof. When she got around back she was mocked by Jen.<br />
<br />
“It serves you right, now that&#39;s your bitch to deal with now! I&#39;m surprised your not like, fifty feet tall!” <br />
<br />
“Well,” Kayla responded nervously. “Your just jealous you don&#39;t look this hot!” She shook her massive bust in front of Jen&#39;s window. “And now I get to play with all of this!” She squeezed them in front of her. “And you get to know that I&#39;m playing with it!” <br />
<br />
This got a window slam, obviously making Jen uncomfortable, Kayla didn&#39;t like the new size of her lower half, but she would have to live with it from now on, unless she figured out how to use the curse to change it. She finished cleaning the back of the roof and made her way gently back to the front of the house, her movements careful as to not destroy anything around her, her new massive size making it a little more difficult. <br />
<br />
“Job&#39;s done.” Kayla shouted down.<br />
<br />
“Okay honey, I&#39;ll see you at home.” Her mom responded. Kayla wondered where home was and instantly was informed that they lived in a ranch that was once an abandoned factory area at the outskirts of town. Kayla started walking home, her fate sealed to be fused to a giantess, it was a strange sight.<br />
<br />
Her lower body perfectly proportioned, curvy, thin and busty, leading up to a very small, thin and pale male body riding on top of it where it&#39;s head should be. Kayla couldn&#39;t even see past her massive shoulders, they took up her view as she looked to her left and right. She also had a blind spot in front of her, her bust now naturally perky, having rejuvenated itself because of her age, it bounced heavily with every step. She groaned, at this point her fear of heights was in over drive, but she found herself able to ignore it with the thought that if she fell, it wouldn&#39;t even be that painful to her. <br />
<br />
She thought about how unrealistic her weight and size should be right now, she shouldn&#39;t be able to move, and as she walked she was given her new past history. A genetic defect that had made her a conjoined twin, and an even rarer defect that gave her a new form of gigantism, one that could affect the entire body, but also could affect one portion of it. Her health was astonishingly perfect, the doctors were amazed by how little she had trouble with her strange condition, and just like this morning when she was &#39;normal&#39; sized, people still treated her kindly. <br />
<br />
The giantess had taken a short cut, walking through an empty field when she suddenly felt it, she was getting horny. “Oh no.” Kayla gasped as she remembered the second part of her curse, she tried to fight it as her lower half stopped, fell to it&#39;s knees and started to touch itself. “STOP! NOT HERE!” Kayla yelled at the giantess, who ignored her and started to message her breasts, falling backwards, hitting the earth as her musings continued. Kayla did the only thing she could do, she gave in, knowing that there was nothing she could to to stop herself she started to message her male chest as the goddess continued, reaching down and deftly messaging her pussy, the hunger hitting harder now, Kayla moaned. She looked around and saw a large, round and worn pillar of stone, her giant hand reached over and grabbed it. “NO! WE DON&#39;T KNOW WHERE THAT&#39;S...!&#39; Kayla was cut off by a yelp and a moan as the stone was inserted into her giant pussy, her feet planted in the dirt, her pelvis presented as her body thrust upward and played with itself. <br />
<br />
Kayla had never felt ecstasy like this before, not just from a female masturbation, but from one that was scaled up by five times it&#39;s original size, she shuddered, drooling as the boy now girl felt heavenly bliss for the first time. She climaxed, screaming in pleasure as the goddess gave her the gift of her first orgasm, finally having satisfied itself, Kayla stretched out the legs of her lower body, pulling the stone out of her massive pussy. Moaning, tears in her eyes, not of pain or fear, but out of the afterglow of her first orgasm as a woman. She panted, was it always going to be like this, she couldn&#39;t just do this in the middle of town could she? <br />
<br />
Kayla got up after a while, legs still shaky, she stood, the stench of her sex in the field and on the stone pillar she had used, and was still holding, she gently set it back in it&#39;s place, as if she hadn&#39;t ripped it from it&#39;s resting spot and shakily walked the rest of the way home. Her mind was clearer than ever, she had played herself very badly and would have to deal with this life from now on, but looking down at the terrifying power of her massive lower half, she found that it wasn&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
Kayla found the new place that they called home, seeing not only a ranch house for her mother, but a large warehouse behind it.<br />
<br />
“That must be my home.” Kayla muttered. “Cause I can&#39;t fit in a regular house.” She continued to walk. “Well, let&#39;s see how this freak lives.” Kayla made her way to the warehouse and opened the door.</p>
