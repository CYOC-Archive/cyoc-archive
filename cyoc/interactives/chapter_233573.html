<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I actually think the eyes look kind cool.” Maddy said, calmly walking back into the room. Louis nodded casually… awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Maddy sat back down. She felt quite strange. A lot more flesh touching the chair than she was used to. And of course she was slightly higher up.<br />
She looked at Louis, who was still standing. His ass really stuck out like a sore-thumb. He clearly felt, and looked, pretty uncomfortable.<br />
“Why don’t you sit down?”<br />
“N-no… I’m okay.”<br />
“Just do it. I get it, we both got huge asses.”<br />
“WELL—” Louis yelled, but quickly stopped himself. He put his hands on his face, “this sucks.” He said to himself, “This really fucking sucks.”<br />
“Louis…”<br />
“I get it! You lost your tits or whatever, and I know you wanted them and stuff but jeez… I wasted a wish on trying to look fatter for a girl who doesn’t even know my god-damn name.”<br />
“Louis. I get it.”<br />
“I know you get it! That’s what’s pissing me off! You do all of this, trying to impress these girls who you don’t even like that much, all so they like you. And in like a year you’re never even gonna speak to them again.” He vented. He exhaled as he slumped back into the couch. Maddy noticed him reaction to the foreign feeling of his big ass hitting the seats, “and here I am, acting just like you. I’m meant to be the older one. The smarter one. The one who’s not in all this stupid cliques because I’m an adult.”<br />
“Who the hell said you were the smarter one? Or the better one. Or the one who’s meant to make yourself look better than me or whatever.” Maddy said, “you said that. Only you.”<br />
Louis stayed quiet.<br />
“Louis, I don’t care how you see yourself. I don’t care how anyone else sees you, because to me you’re just my stupid older brother who I argue with all the time for no actual reason other than we’re related. I’m stuck with you in my life, and that’s what I gotta accept.”<br />
<br />
Again, a few moments of silence before anyone did anything.<br />
Maddy took the initiative and stood up, approaching the table, selecting her two cards,<br />
“You’re my dumbass annoying sister.”<br />
“Yep.” Maddy said. <br />
Neither of them looked at each other; but they each had some kind of smile. And they both kind of knew that.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Now my Action Card says ‘Pick Up an Extra Change Card’.” She leant down and grabbed an extra change card, “and my change cards are, ‘Thick Eyebrows’. Great.”<br />
She’s felt the fibres of her eyebrows quite literally thicken, then the carefully plucked shape she’d spent hours on was replaced by a considerably thicker pair of eyebrows. And even more, the bridge between her eyebrows seemed to grew, causing a ruby coloured mono brow to spread. She lifted her finger up, feeling the thickness of each brow, and then touching the centre,<br />
“I don’t even wanna look.”<br />
“It’s not that bad…” Louis said, smirking a little. Maddy smirked back at the comment. She lifted the second change card up and read it,<br />
“Bovine Spots…”<br />
<br />
She looked down at her arm, and could feel a slightly change of the pigment in her skin. It was getting darker, in splotchy places, spreading all over her body. Several on her left arm, her right. She even felt it on her stomach, and her legs, her back. It travelled up her neck, until it touched her face. She felt a large area of change over her left eye. Then it stopped.<br />
“That’s not great…” she said to herself,<br />
“No… it’s not really that bad to be honest.”<br />
“O-okay… why don’t you take your turn while I check this out.” Maddy said, biting her lip. She quickly rushed over to the mirror in the hallway.<br />
<br />
Louis, wanting this to be over as fast as possible, quickly reached out and grabbed his two cards. He’d lost the somewhat excitement of the random card selection. He was now ready to be back to normal and throw this game away as quickly as he could.<br />
“‘Card Applies to Opposite Player’… and Change Card… ‘Maternal… Mammaries’.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Maddy looked at herself. She sighed. The spots looked… weird, but they really weren’t that big of a deal. The real culprit was the eyebrows. They were significantly worse than before, a lot thicker than she expected, and in no way did she ‘rock’ the Unibrow look. She was half-tempted to grab her tweezers from her bedroom upstairs.<br />
<br />
Then Maddy started to feel… a little weird. Like a tightness in her chest? No. A fullness. She placed her hand on her left boob, feeling it feel tighter and tighter. It almost felt like something in her breast was changing.<br />
They felt significantly more sensitive all of a sudden. And then she looked herself in the mirror, and noticed. They looked bigger! But not sexier bigger… they looked engorged. She put her hands on her chest, looking down to see her cleavage forming in a strange way.<br />
However they did start growing, and they got heavier too. They filled more and more, filling out her dress more. She could even see her nipples starting to poke through the now too-tight dress. Yet her nipples… they looked a little, thicker? She pulled at the side of her dress to look down, and her nipples were darker! Bigger, larger, everything!<br />
“FUCK!” She yelled, “d-did you make me lactate!?” <br />
And as if on cue, her she felt the warm sticky sensation of milk on her dress.<br />
She looked herself in the mirror, staring as dark milky patches appeared on her chest, growing as her breasts leaked more and more of her breastmilk.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“God I wish you did this on purpose so I can be so mad at you.”<br />
“I didn’t! I swear.”<br />
“I KNOW you didn’t do it. I’m just pissed anyway.” She shrugged, slumping into her seat. The force causing her breasts to convulse, which made her breasts ache, which made her more annoyed, “look at me suddenly becoming the human milk-machine.”</p>
