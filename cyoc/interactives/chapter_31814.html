<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">6:00AM Growth in the morning<br />
<br />
(With the permission of the author here is my version of what happened that morning.)<br />
<br />
	Allen had restored Peter to his normal form, but with an additional wish, that Peter would grow huge early in the morning.<br />
<br />
	When the clock displayed the time as 6:00AM, and Peter was still sound asleep in bed, while wearing just his jock, Allen's magic started to work on him.<br />
<br />
	With each breath Peter's chest started to expand as it filled up air. Unlike a balloon that needed air to pump it up, Peter's chest was being pumped full of muscle. His shoulders widened dramatically, and his arms grew into thick pythons of muscle which were hard as steel. His lower torso formed into powerful abs of rocks, which lined up neatly in rows and columns like tiles.<br />
 <br />
	Next, his legs widened and filled up into columns of rock-solid muscle. These were legs belonging to an athlete like a professional power lifter, with super-thick quads and calves to die for.<br />
<br />
The jock that Peter was wearing now looked small in comparison to the rest of his body. Even in Allen's minds eye he thought that everything should be bigger. The furrows on Allen's forehead deepened while he concentrated on the jock. At the same, the bulge under the jock began to expand outward. The jock strained to contain the growing bulge that now lay on top of Peter's thighs. The jock’s material began to change as it grew. The white cotton changed into black Lycra spandex. The cheek straps merged into one as it disappeared between Peters growing ass.<br />
<br />
	During all the growth Peter never woke up, but he had a huge smile on his face. Allen looked into Peter's mind to see what he was dreaming about. <br />
<br />
In Peter's dream world everything was perfect. Everyone loved his body because it was so perfect. His own paper-thin skin covered a network of veins that crisscrossed the striated muscles of his body. He was a fraction over seven feet tall with shoulders wider than most doorways. His chest was so thick that he could not see below them unless he bent forward. His had picture-perfect rock-hard abs. His thighs were the size of small tree-trunks. His family jewels were no less than perfect as well. His cock, which was about twelve inches long when it was soft, was as wide as a beer can and his balls were the size of tennis balls. Everything he wore showed off his magnificent bulge. He drew a large crowd of onlookers everywhere he went.<br />
<br />
 He strained to move his body through the thick crowds of admiring fans. He found it impossible to move despite his great strength.  It felt to him like his entire body had gone to sleep and that the &quot;pins and needles&quot;-feeling was making it hard to move any body-part. Then, suddenly the dream turned into a nightmare when he found himself strapped to an examination table in some sort of lab. The admiring fans had turned into doctors who were sticking him with hypodermic needles. <br />
<br />
Peter woke with a start from his nightmare. The feeling of immobility he had in his dream was still there. For some strange reason he was feeling bigger and heavier now! He raised his head to look down at his body, but all he saw was a mound of bedding material. To him it looked liked someone had covered him with an over-stuffed feather bed mattress. Peter struggled to move the seemingly heavy bedding material but all he found was a sheet. As soon as he had removed it, he found out that his chest was the mound that had blocked his view! He was bigger; much bigger than any pro bodybuilder; bigger than any Mr. Olympia. The bed creaked as he moved his feet to the floor to stand up, than he saw the bulge in his black Speedo. <br />
&quot;MY GOD I'M HUGE!&quot; He yelled with joy. <br />
<br />
	&quot;If you think you are big now,&quot; says a voice in Peter's head. ”Just wait until you see what’s coming next!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter began to feel his body with his hands. He stopped momentarily at his crotch. The black Y-back Speedo had one-inch sides but had plenty of room in the pouch area. As he looked at his crotch it showed how pleased he was with what he was given. The bulge began to increase in size stretching the shiny black material even thinner. It went from baseball size to softball within seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to the jock I was wearing last night?&quot; Peter said out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that a change of attire was in order for the body you have now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But today is year book picture day.&quot; Peter said into the air. &quot;None of my good clothes will fit me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax take a shower. You can go look in your closet later.&quot; The voice said. &quot;There has been a change in your 'good' clothes as well, thanks to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A nice hot shower would help me relax all these tense muscles I got last night.&quot; thought Peter. <br />
<br />
“Then to the shower with you.” Said the voice in Peter’s head.<br />
<br />
The next thing Peter knew he was in the bathroom. When he turned on the light and what he saw in the mirror surprised him, his dream body was staring back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’ve outdone yourself this time Allen.&quot; Peter said as he did a few poses. &quot;I may want to keep this body for awhile.&quot; <br />
<br />
Peter slipped the Speedo down over his bulge letting everything fall out. His semi-hard cock hung over his large balls. The head was now halfway to his knees. The quick five minute morning shower took longer, about thirty minutes longer. Once Peter started soaping his body he couldn't stop touching his rock hard muscles. It didn't take long, with all his caressing, for his cock to be effected. First it got longer as it headed towards the shower drain. Then it got fatter as it began to rise and point straight out from Peter’s groin. When it reached its full length of fourteen hard inches it rose pointing straight up between Peter's pecs. <br />
<br />
All the time that Peter's cock was growing his balls were filling up with his seed. The fleshy orbs drew up tighter to his body. He could almost see the thick liquid churning inside.<br />
<br />
While all this self-worship was having a pleasant effect on Peter, Allen was enjoying it as well in his own room miles away. The two were locked in mental contact so everything Peter felt Allen felt the same thing. When Peter moved his hands he thought he did it on his own. He had forgotten that Allen had full control over his body.  Allen moved Peter's hands where &quot;Allen&quot; wanted them to go and Allen wanted them to go for Peter's cock. Peter's hands began rubbing in the precum that had been flowing down his cock for the last five minutes. The pressure was so great that here was an audible &quot;Splat&quot; when Peter's cum escaped his cock and hit the top of the shower. It mixed with water from shower covering his body from head to toe. At the same time, a few miles away, Allen was having the same pleasurable experience. The pleasure was so great that Allen released his contact with Peter setting his lover free to be himself. Once the contact was broken Peter saw what time it was and hurried to get dress for school.<br />
<br />
He left the bathroom after his morning shower to get dressed for the day at school. He had to re-think how to walk with his new size. With a bodybuilders gant he walked to his bedroom. <br />
<br />
“I going to be late for picture day.&quot; Peter says seeing the alarm clock.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. I can teleport you there when you are dressed.”<br />
<br />
 &quot;Have it your way Allen.” Said Peter. “Now show me your idea of 'good clothes' is for picture day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The closet doors magically opened by itself. All the clothes that were inside were now made of form fitting material. There were dozens of “Under Armor” shirts of every imaginable color. There were long sleeve, short sleeve, no-sleeve and tank tops. There were a couple of leather vests hanging in his closet. Hanging next to all the shirts were pants made of leather, denim, cotton and workout pants made of Lycra spandex.<br />
<br />
Gone were all of his boxers and briefs from his dresser drawers. They were replaced with a variety of low riding bikini underwear, posing suits and sports jocks. All of them had pouches big enough to hold the biggest cocks around.<br />
<br />
“Now that you have your shower now for the clothes.” Says Allen <br />
All of sudden Peter was wearing pair of a red poser. “OH MAN! That’s tight” exclaimed Peter.<br />
<br />
“But they look good on you.” Said the voice in Peter’s head. “And you fill them out nicely.” <br />
<br />
The next thing to appear on Peter’s body was a blue sleeveless Under Amour shirt. The shirt was so form fitting it looked like the shirt was painted on.<br />
<br />
“Looking good.” Said Peter as he examined his body in the bedroom mirror.<br />
<br />
“You’ll look even better wearing these.”  A pair of form-fitting blue jean covered his tree trunk legs. The pants did little to hide how much Peter loved the clothes his lover had picked out for him. He was feeling a little like the guy from that show called “Smallville” today. All he was missing was a red cape and a big yellow “S”. <br />
“The red cape would be nice but a bit much right now but I like the “S” idea.” Said the voice in Peter’s head.<br />
<br />
A large golden “S” appeared on a change around Peter’s neck. <br />
Standing in front the mirror with his hands on his hips Peter says. “This was going to be memorable picture day.” With that said Peter’s room dissolves into the school quad.</p>
