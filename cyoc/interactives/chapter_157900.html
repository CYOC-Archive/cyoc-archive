<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ll keep this power”<br />
<br />
“Ok, stand up please!”<br />
<br />
I got out of the chair and everything disappeared. We were standing in the dark abyss again. <br />
<br />
“Take off your clothes except for your boxer briefs!”<br />
<br />
I did as I was told and took off my clothes. When I took my pants off, I wasn’t wearing my old boxer briefs. Instead, I was wearing what both felt and looked like cloth underwear.<br />
<br />
“That’ll be your diapers for a couple of years, so get used to it.” <br />
<br />
I looked around it and noticed there were safety pins that secured my diaper. Before I knew it, my body was shrinking. <br />
<br />
”This is my one and only goodbye. You&#39;ll be sent to a nice family in the countryside. You&#39;ll learn magic from your father while your mother works for the king. By the age of four, I recommend that you learn to use your power quickly.”<br />
<br />
By this point, I was the size of a toddler and realized I wasn&#39;t shrinking, I was becoming younger. <br />
<br />
”Farewell, and good luck!” I had become a newborn baby and was blinded by a bright light. <br />
<br />
The only thing I could hear was a woman scream in pain and another woman congratulating her as “the baby” was coming out.<br />
<br />
The pain I felt going out of the vagina was crazy, causing my baby body to start whining.<br />
<br />
“There there little one, everything is ok now. Let’s make sure you’re healthy before we give you to momma!”<br />
<br />
I could barely see what was happening, but I felt needles go into my body after the end of the walk. <br />
<br />
After the long and painful checkup, I could hear a door open as someone carried me somewhere. “He is a healthy baby boy, congratulations on the delivery Mrs Gapor!”<br />
<br />
I felt another person’s hands and felt contact with what I can assume was my mother. She was warm, and I could hear her heartbeat as she rocked me back and forth. It was calming to say the least.<br />
<br />
“Look, he has your big forehead.” A close female voice stated out. <br />
<br />
“Honey of course he has a big forehead, he is my son. That tiny brain right now will be big and full of knowledge on magic!” A male voice responded.<br />
<br />
“So you’ll teach him magic? Why not get a tutor?”<br />
<br />
“It’s better for me to teach him myself. I’ve been teaching for most of my life, so what’s one more student?”<br />
<br />
“Ok, but promise me that you’ll raise him into a nice boy. I’d hate to arrest our own son.”<br />
<br />
“I promise!”<br />
<br />
I listened to their conversation as I rested on my mother’s chest. What I could gather is that my father used to teach magic, and he quit for some reason. My mother had something to do with the law, and didn’t want to arrest me.<br />
<br />
Needles, arrest, and cloth diapers. These three things could help me figure out the current year, but it wasn’t enough. <br />
<br />
“Have you figured out a name for your little one?” An unfamiliar voice asked. <br />
<br />
“Thomas! Thomas Gapor!”<br />
<br />
“Thomas Gapor, born on June 25, 1800! He will have an interesting life with you two.”<br />
<br />
‘1800? That means I have to grow up in the crappy conditions of that time?’ I thought to myself.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to a few months, and I could see both my mother and father. <br />
<br />
My mother was an elegant woman, both in and out of her armor. She had blue eyes and very short brown hair. If you saw her in the 21st century, you’d think she was a boy. Her tan skin complimented her muscles, but only the places her skin was revealing was tan. The boobs of hers were almost pale white, practically blinding me when I was fed. <br />
<br />
My father looked like a man who’s an accountant by day, and Star Wars nerd by night. He had long blond hair and had green eyes. His glasses on his face had a thin outline, but I guess that’s how glasses were made in the 1800’s. He didn’t have tan skin, but it wasn’t pale white like my mother’s boobs. He also didn’t have the typical dad body, but more of a skinny millennial.<br />
<br />
I’ve only seen my mother naked, and I would hate to see my father’s parts.<br />
<br />
Six months have passed and I got used to the diapered lifestyle by now. My routine was simple: wake up, cry for food, cry for diaper change, be entertained by my parents, cry for food again, entertainment again, diaper change and food, then sleep. There are way more diaper changes in between, but too many to list. <br />
<br />
Listening to my parent’a conversation, something was happening soon.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you can’t stay here? You can set up shop in the town square and sell your goods!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry honey, but that village is the only good source of income for us. I am the only one who makes potions there, and the business is good.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, but please visit frequently. I’d hate to miss my child growing up!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I will!”<br />
<br />
The next day I could see that we weren’t home anymore. The sound of horses walking, the fresh smell of the countryside, the blue sky above me. I could already tell my diaper had been changed before waking up, and that it was just my father next to me. The carriage ride wasn’t too long, and the view above me wasn’t too bad.<br />
<br />
When we stopped, I could hear crowds of people, just like when I was walked through the kingdom’s sidewalks. <br />
<br />
“Welcome back Mr Gapor!” Is what I could mostly hear. Everyone that greeted were mostly female, and what I can assume were mothers based on my father’s job.<br />
<br />
I looked ahead and saw a store. The language was unfamiliar, but I’d soon learn it. Inside the store was rows upon rows of potions and remedies. My father owned a medieval pharmacy, and was good at it too. <br />
<br />
He opened another door and walked up some stairs. “Welcome Home Thomas!” I could barely see, but I knew the place around me had to be some kind of living room.<br />
<br />
My father grabbed me and held me out to see the room. It wasn’t just a living room, but a kitchen and dining room all together. There were other doors, but this place was just one large room.<br />
<br />
Living at home was different than where I lived before. Every morning my father fed me what tasted like cows milk. I had my diaper changed and I was carried downstairs, where my father worked.<br />
<br />
Most of the day I’d get compliments by mothers who needed a restoration potion for their child. Sometimes, a man my father knew would ask for something in a language only my father knew, and he’d provide him with a shot glass sided potion.<br />
<br />
When I became 1, that is when things start to go crazy. I had already learned how to walk, but I needed some form of support to do so. By now, cradles weren’t my bed anymore, and I slept with my father most of the time being.<br />
<br />
Talking and learning how to read came early for me. My father first taught me “dada” and “mama” but these words I already knew. <br />
<br />
The alphabet in this world is different than mine. It had 26 letters, but each one looked like a 5 year old tried to do cursive with the knowledge of the letters being “swiggly wiggly”. It took some time, but I was able to understand their version of ‘A’.<br />
<br />
Every now and then, my father and I would visit mother and surprise her at work. She’d treat me like any mother who missed her child, and even have presents for me. <br />
<br />
They were mostly clothes and toys, but what else could you get a baby.<br />
<br />
When I was two, that is when learning became a thing for me 24/7. I was told to stay in the downstairs living room while my dad works in the room next door, and I spent time learning on my own. Writing and understanding the letters became tiresome sometimes, but it paid off in the end. <br />
<br />
When I was three, my father decided to do his own version of potty train me, and it was hard. All he did was replace my diapers with something that looked like sweat pants. Half the time I had accidents due to the fact that the only toilet with running water was upstairs.<br />
<br />
When I was four, I had control of my bladder, enough to hold it sometimes. It was a good thing this world was basically the 1900s but 100 years off on the calendar, because running water and entertainment would be different in the actual 1800s.<br />
<br />
It was the year that I gained my power, and it was also the year my father claimed he’d teach me magic.<br />
<br />
My father and I slept in the same bed as usual. I wasn’t able to sleep, but I didn’t want to bother my father by telling him that.<br />
<br />
I was looking at the wall when suddenly, a white light appears, and the woman who sent me here four years ago came out of the light.<br />
<br />
“So, how’s my little guy? Did he activate his power yet?”<br />
<br />
I shook my head no. I wasn’t sure how to activate it, and I was kinda scared to activate it.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s a shame. I can tell you have some doubt in your capabilities, but it’s ok,” she hovered over and laid her hand on my forehead. <br />
<br />
“Now, you should fully understand your power, and other types of magic that can change ages of things.” She hovered back into the light, blew a kiss, and left.<br />
<br />
I laid in bed that night, and had finally asked my father to help me sleep. There were a few things he used to do when I was younger, and twirling his finger in my hair was one of them. He did that and it slowly got me to sleep.<br />
<br />
In the morning, that’s when things begin to start.</p>
