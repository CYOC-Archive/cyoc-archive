<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven, Samantha&#39;s Boyfriend woke up in the morning to a strange mix of smells. Getting up off the couch he made his way to the kitchen to make coffee for himself and Samantha. On his way he realized that the smells were coming from Samantha&#39;s room, but a quick look showed a blanket covered Samantha sleeping in her bed. Steven chose to search for the source of the smell after coffee and continued to the kitchen. <br />
Coffee was done soon and Steven returned to the bedroom with two cups in hand. When he entered the room he was surprised a just how strong the smell was. It was pungent and almost stung his nose to smell it. It was definitely a smell of sex but it was not the normal smell that he and Samantha ended with when they slept together. <br />
<br />
After approaching the bed Steven put the cups on the nightstand and tried to wake Samantha up. Her head was mostly buried in a plush pillow and her body was covered in a blanket so when Steven shook her shoulder to wake her he only got a sleepy grunt in response. Steve was about to try a little harder when her grunting continued and she started a strange humping movement under her blankets. This movement also came with a moist glooping sound and a strengthening of the strange smell. <br />
<br />
Mostly curious but slightly afraid of what he would see Steven threw back the blanket to expose Samanthas body. Samantha had taken 6 pills the night before with each one after the first taken too soon to not cause a mutation leaving Samanthas body to undergo 5 permanent mutations. <br />
1 Breast Expansion<br />
2 Hip and Ass Expansion<br />
3 Testical Growth and Added Penis Length Retention<br />
4 Further Breast an Nipple Expansion<br />
5 Erogenous Sweat Glands<br />
Steven stood in shock and had he still been holding the coffee he would have dropped them. Samantha who had previously been an adequately curvy girl that Steven felt extremely lucky to be dating was now seriously Thicc and sporting a pair of breasts that had to be the biggest in their school. The nipples were huge the size of ping-pong balls and their tip looked big enough to fit a finger into. The biggest shock though was the 9 in meat stick and tennis ball sized testicals now attached to her crotch. In the middle of the night her cock had reached a length of 18 inches with each pill causing 3 inches of growth but this growth was temporary and it was only the mutation&#39;s added length retention that left her with a cock easily twice Steven&#39;s below average specimen. <br />
As steven Stared Samantha&#39;s humping would grow slower as the lack of blanket cooled her body and she finally woke up properly. Samantha then saw Steven&#39;s shocked face and bolted up into a seated position asking Steven what was wrong. She answered her own question when the huge mass of tit flesh almost sent her tumbling as her boobs swayed about on her chest. There was a moment of silence between both of them as Samantha looked down at her new expanded bust that was broken by both of them asking each other what happened. There was a brief discussion about how neither of them knew how this happened, that was interrupted when Samantha looked between her legs and saw the thick cock and huge balls that she was now equipped with. Samantha screamed for a bit and started to get teary as she though that no one could love her now but seeing this caused Steven to quickly sit next to her and begin comforting her by saying that she was going to be ok and that they could get through this together. He then remembered and hypothesized that this must have been the work of the penis pills. Steven left the room for a bit to collect the package with the remaining pills to read their label. When he returned he found Samantha rubbing her cock and groaning. Samantha asked Steven to forgive her but it felt so good and she couldn&#39;t stop herself. She continued to massage her large cock with both of her hands but also began to cry as she was unable to control herself in front of her boyfriend. Steven quickly sat back by her side and put a hand on one of her&#39;s touch it and her cock. Samantha expected him to help her remove her hands from her cock but he instead began massaging her cock right along side her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t cry. I love you and nothing here is going to stop that&quot; said Steven with emotion in his voice <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank so much. I love you too&quot; answered Samantha who&#39;s tear were turned from sadness to joy as she began to kiss Steven. <br />
<br />
Together they sat there for more than a full minute kissing and rubbing Samantha&#39;s large cock until with a moan of pleasure Samantha stiffed up and her cock began to spurt thick white cum all over the place. After her orgasm ended and the kiss broke apart Samantha finally noticed the coffee that had been set on the nightstand. As she grabbed them she noticed that they had both gotten a sizable amount of her cum floating at the top of them. She commented in a sad tone that they were ruined and was about to go and toss them when Steven took his glass and downed the portion that had her cum floating in it. Steven then commented that it was delicious and that she could never ruin it.<br />
<br />
Soon after, the two showered and inspected exactly what had changed with Samantha&#39;s body finding that her armpits were extra sensitive and pleasureful for her. They also started discussing what should be done with the pills now that they knew what they could do. They decided that . . .</p>
