<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Catching the public bus to within a block of where he lived, Drake sat in silence, lost in thought, wondering something about his slow transformation. In a surreptitious manner, he glanced at Cecilia, thinking about how he felt about the girl and what a pervert he was for having such thoughts about a girl that was clearly younger than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But am I not supposedly the same age?&quot; he mentally asked himself as he looked out the window at the passing traffic and houses.<br />
<br />
Unable to come to a decision, a feeling of being conflicted settled over Drake. Thinking that if he was indeed turning into a teenage girl, that it just wasn't logical for a girl to love another girl and that they liked the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or do they?&quot; he thought, suddenly unsure about such a thought and struggling to remember, he tried to think of any time he might have seen a woman dating another woman.<br />
<br />
Drawing a blank as he had realised that he couldn't remember parts of his previous life, Drake blinked and wondered how it was that he could be forgetting his old life, but quickly figured that it must have something to do with the new memories he had been experiencing all day. Glancing at Cecilia in another surreptitious manner, Drake thought, &quot;I cannot really be feeling feelings of love for her because I haven't felt none of the normal ways my body tells me I am in love, including my penis getting hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
A squeal of air brakes breaks Drakes concentration and looking about, he realised that they were nearing the stop closet his house and glancing at Cecilia, he thought about asking her something, but instead changed his mind. When the bus drew closer to his house, Drake reached up and pulled the cord to signal a stop. As he did so, he found his mind returning to the question of how it was that he could possibly have feelings for the girl walking next to him. Approaching his house, Drake shifted his backpack and opening one of the pockets, he took out his house keys. As he zipped the pocket close, he thought about the Zulo's Necklace and wondering what he should do with it, Drake decided in the end to leave it stored in his backpack for the moment.<br />
<br />
Letting himself into the house, Drake heard Cecilia ask, &quot;Mind if I get something to drink?&quot; and nodding, his thoughts still troubled about how he felt for the teenage girl, Drake nodded in a distracted manner and replied, &quot;I'll meet you in the kitchen in a moment,&quot; and kicking off his shoes, he headed up to his room.<br />
<br />
There, he found that over the course of one day his room had completely changed into something more appropriate for a teenage girl and shrugging, figuring this was normal, Drake dropped his backpack on his bed. Turning to the fully-body mirror, he gazed at his reflection, noting that he still looked like a thirty six year old man. Locking his bedroom door, he began to undress before the mirror and when he had shed the last of his clothing, Drake stood nude before the reflective object, taking in his reflection.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was how thin he looked, but found it confusing because he still looked like he stood six foot one. Still examining how thin he had become, he let his eyes drift down, noting that his stomach had completely flattened out, and when he saw his genitals, he nearly let out a moan of alarm at what he had seen.<br />
<br />
Not a vain man to begin with, Drake could suddenly understand why some men were as he took in how small his penis and testicles were and how they hugged his body so closely, they were practically none existent. Touching his penis, which he remembered would normally elicit some sort of response, Drake wasn't the least bit surprised when nothing happened and instead took his hand away as thoughts about how it was wrong for a girl to be touching herself down there, unless she was showering or wiping herself after using the toilet, crossed his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to sit in order to pee,&quot; he muttered, as he realised that not only were his genitals were so small, but the mental reaction he had from touching them pretty much made sure that the only way to pee was to sit down.<br />
<br />
Fetching a robe, curious about something else, Drake pulled on the soft garment, liking how it pressed against his A cup breasts and the four extra nipples and brushed against his exposed skin. Thinking about how he felt for Cecilia, as well as his appearance, he slipped out of his room and headed for the bathroom, mentally going over way he knew would normally get a response from his body when he thought that way about someone he loved.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the only thing he really noted when he thought about Cecilia was that he had become slightly flushed and that his nipples had become hard.<br />
<br />
Still thinking, &quot;Is it possible for one girl to love another? Or is that just some type of weird perverted thoughts?&quot; Drake slipped into the bathroom and shedding his robe, he approached the bathroom scale and stepping on it, watched as the digital image flashed a couple numbers before finally settling on ninety-three pounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've lost nearly a hundred pounds?!?&quot; Drake thought, amazed that he could still look like a thirty-six year, six foot one man but weighed about what he figured a young teenage girl should weigh.<br />
<br />
Putting back on his robe, feeling both troubled and that what the readout from the scale said was true, Drake slipped out of the bathroom and back to his room. Inside, he locked the door and began to redress, his mind returning to the issue of how he felt toward Cecilia and how it just couldn't possibly be right and what he was feeling was surely because of how old he was and how it was a major time of change for a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be it,&quot; he told himself as he opened the top drawer of his dresser and began to pull out a pair of boxers, a pair of boy shorts and two bras, failing to realise that everything in his dresser was now for a teenage girl.<br />
<br />
Unpacking his backpack, he thought for a moment about his purchase and in the end, pulled the tags off and threw them into the laundry bin in the closet. Repacking his pack for the weekend, making sure that he had the necessary hygiene supplies, he exited his room and headed toward the kitchen. There he found Cecilia standing next to the counter, drink a glass of juice. As Drake headed for the fridge, deciding to get himself not only something to drink but also something to snack on, Cecilia set her glass down on the counter and approached Drake.<br />
<br />
As Drake took the container of juice out of the fridge, Cecilia asked him, &quot;You know how I have asking if everything is all right?&quot; to which Drake gave a nod, the feeling of affection he felt for the teenage girl suddenly stronger than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Cecilia started to stay and then faltered as Drake set the juice on the counter.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Cecilia opened her mouth, began to say something, closed her mouth and then suddenly blurted out, &quot;I think I know what it is and why you keep glancing at me and why it is the way I feel,&quot; and pushing herself toward Drake, she kissed him fully on the mouth, whispering, &quot;I've wanted to do that for some time,&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
As something in Drake's mind shifted, he found himself returning the kiss, whispering, &quot;Me too,&quot; as he did so.<br />
<br />
An understanding suddenly came to him and as he realised that two young women could love each other, he kissed Cecilia again as she clumsily hugged him closer. Kissing the teenage girl again, no longer feeling like a pervert, Drake understood how wrong he had been in trying to analyse his feelings for Cecilia and that what he felt for her was right as Cecilia returned his kiss.</p>
