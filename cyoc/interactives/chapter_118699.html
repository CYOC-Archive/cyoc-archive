<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Akane looked out over the gathered werefoxes and in the case of those who were honorary members, their mates. Despite many of the complications that the Skulk had at present, particularly in honoring its debts to Jennifer Harper and William Anderson being clawed by a rogue vixen. Akane noted that William Anderson seemed pleased with the fact that his bond formed to his wife and seemed to save his marriage from something personal, which Akane wouldn&#39;t delve into. That was good for the Skulk in that there wasn&#39;t that much to do to support him beyond a warm welcome and being friendly. The thing that presently had the most work was making sure Jennifer Harper and Harry Jenkins were secure in a happy marriage and their own happy ever after, and so far, the Skulk had worked with the city to put together a plan that would allow for it.<br />
<br />
And for the moment,  all that could be done on the wedding front was to wait, and in looking to Jenny smile at the encouragement given to her from the mated werefoxes, and apparently William Anderson&#39;s congratulatory remarks very much so, Akane felt some confident that Jenny would be fine. All she needed was the security to make sure this Dieter Wilhelm caused no further lasting trouble, and that was arranged. For the moment, the Skulk only had to conclude its meeting and be continue on, and that seemed to be going swimmingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am greatly pleased by all the ideas offered for Halloween, including the new ideas we&#39;ve gotten,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure they will ALL provide Moon Lake with plenty of fun for the holiday, and I will leave it up to the individual Den Leaders to coordinate the execution of the ideas we&#39;ve all agreed on. I will also remind everyone that any private pranks will need to follow the same rules for the Skulk&#39;s official pranks and the Skulk will not defend those that go beyond the rules we&#39;ve all agreed to. Because games are only fun when ALL laugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
At the Wood Street Den&#39;s table, things rapidly moved into much of the implication of things agreed to. Julian and Diane Wyre were quick to get things focused, as was their responsibility as the Wood Street Den leaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll start with looking toward what we can and cannot do in our den,&quot; Diane said slowly, &quot;First does anyone have any denning work that they have?&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple at the table raised their hands, though William and Martha kept their hands down. William because he figured there wasn&#39;t anything official that he or Martha had at home, as while they did have children, Nate and Eric were old enough that they didn&#39;t need be at home all the time to care for them or take them trick or treating. Martha kept her hand down as she was a bit perplexed on words &quot;denning work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She means if you have any pressing home business on Halloween night,&quot; Dawn Hale whispered into Martha&#39;s ear, &quot;sick children, trick or treating, and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Martha nodded softly and looked on.<br />
<br />
Not many responded that they had pressing denning duties to handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then,&quot; Julian commented as the check for who had pressing den work to do was handled, &quot;Those who have their own den work do will be excused, but that will leave the rest of us to make sure that Halloween on Wood Street has plenty of fun and the appropriate amount of mischief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As well as our responsibilities for other Moon Lake events,&quot; Diane finished for her husband and looked to Dawn and Douglas Hale, &quot;Dawn, Douglas... do you wish to continue to serve as our den&#39;s chaperones for the Halloween Dance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Douglas answered, &quot;it&#39;s fun, and I think Dawn still takes a great deal of pride in seeing how well kids she had her class turned out as they made it to High School.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always a teacher,&quot; Julian smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a proud one,&quot; Dawn smiled back, &quot;and Martha will be joining the Elementary School staff next year too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You teach?&quot; Diane asked looking to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;I taught before I got married,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and am presently working to get my certification updated so that it&#39;ll be valid in the state of Washington and meeting the specific requirements for Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully things go well,&quot; Diane smiled, &quot;though, for the moment... we have Halloween to prepare for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha and William both nodded. They then noticed that the den leaders then turned to them specifically. This had them both blink a bit, but they did pay attention. They hoped they hadn&#39;t done or said anything wrong. Eventually, Julian gave a smile which relieved some of their fears, but left them curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;With your idea to reverse things being adopted,&quot; Diane said to Martha, &quot;we would like you and your husband to help with the reversing things idea. It is something new, and you both can make sure it&#39;s done right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha and William both blinked and then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; William answered, holding Martha&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Julian smiled, &quot;we&#39;ll meet at the point where Wood Street meets up with Moon Lake College at nine, when most of trick or treaters are over.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Things were a bit different at the desk for the  Lycaon Drive Den. Taro and Keiko Tachibana both handled the same assignments that the other den leaders did, but made a pointed effort to make sure that Harry and Jenny were free to do what they wished for Halloween and the rest of the weekend. It was something that made sense in that Harry and Jenny were engaged and would be having their wedding the next morning. Jenny figured that they were giving them the freedom to prepare things and be ready for the inevitable happiness at being Mrs. Harry Jenkins, regardless of whatever her parents may try to pull at the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Keiko said with a small smile, &quot;I think that does take care of everything, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything official,&quot; Taro answered, grateful that things had been quiet enough at the hospital today that he wasn&#39;t called in on emergency or on a specified requirement, &quot;though there is the further congratulations to give to young Harry and Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys don&#39;t have to,&quot; Jenny spoke, hoping her cream colored fur hid her blush, &quot;you&#39;ve all done so much for me and been so kind...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in a way Moon Lake operates,&quot; Keiko said softly to both Harry and Jenny, &quot;Were society has had its fair share of ups and downs and has had it&#39;s fair share of differences, just as normal human society has had its fair share of differences... but Moon Lake... it&#39;s a first in that weres of all kinds managed come together and put together a town with weres of all kinds. In that, it&#39;s made Moon Lake special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the Skulk,&quot; Taro spoke, &quot;it&#39;s also necessary as it shows to you that we aren&#39;t all like the rogue who clawed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded with a small smile at that. They weren&#39;t all like Yvette Smith, who from what Jenny could remember seemed to be a bit too promiscuous even for a were when the school year started. She vaguely remembered seeing Yvette approach William Anderson at the desk and presentation area in the classroom. Jenny didn&#39;t hear what was said, but it certainly looked like a proposition of sorts was being made. And maybe Yvette was responding to a were&#39;s libido, but since Jenny had adapted to being a were, herself, she found that while she could be aroused easier than before, it was controllable and she didn&#39;t have the urge to just look for random people to have sex with. There were even plenty of times when she and Harry, after they had bonded to each other as werefoxes, had simply cuddled and so on. Being a were did not mean one was a nymphomaniac. And the other werefoxes present showed that as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And again, thank you,&quot; Jenny said to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both deserve it,&quot; another werefox at their table said to Jenny and Harry, &quot;you both deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harry said with a smile and a nod and wrapped one arm around Jenny, glad to see that she was happy and felt welcome. Her happiness made him happy, and while some things might involve some difficulty in handling them, Harry personally looked forward to a long and happy future with Jenny. He would do all he could to protect that future and make Jenny as happy as she could possibly be.</p>
