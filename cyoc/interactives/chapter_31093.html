<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P> “I don’t know if she is going to stay like this or not,” Lucy said as she walked toward Ginger, “but she is so cute!” Lucy reached under Ginger’s arms and picked her up. She lifted her much short friend right off the bench and into the air. “Wow, Ginger, you are a lot lighter. You much have lost a lot of weight in your thighs.” Lucy giggled and swung her friend around in her arms.

<P>Ginger was less than amused, but even so, she was not all that angry. “Oh ha-ha, very funny,” she retorted in a sarcastic tone. “Can you just put me down? Have I ever made fun of anyone’s weight? Out of all the things I ever said, I never crossed the line by mocking another girl’s weight.” 

<P> “Oh come on, be a sport. You are so cute,” Lucy said as she then tossed her friend in the air. “Wow! Look how light you are,” she giggled as she caught her friend and tossed her back up again. Ginger was less than phased and actually bit her lip to stop from smiling, but it was getting harder and harder. After a few tosses into the air she lost control and started to giggle. She was quickly laughing uncontrollably. “See! You love it!”

<P>Heather was watching all this from the smile with a small smirk across her face. It was funny to see the always cynical and sarcastic Ginger in such a state. She watched Lucy having her fun for a moment before chiming in with her opinion, “you know something. I think Ginger lost more weight than just her legs?” 

<P> “What do you mean?” Ginger as she came back to Lucy’s arms only to go back into the air. 

<P> “I mean, look at you, you can’t weight more than twenty pounds. How else could Lucy be tossing you that high. You are practically hitting the ceiling!” Heather told the girls. 

<P>Michelle meanwhile was standing silently watching behind them. She was wearing lingerie from the same collection and she pulled the tag off same as Ginger did. She knew she was going to transform next. She wondered if she could stop it by stripping quickly, but something was nagging her in the back of the mind. She felt conflicted. It was most likely the unnatural calm she felt. The calm kept them from freaking out watching Ginger transform. Michelle had no fear of what would happen to her. She actually felt a little bit of anticipation. In the back of her mind, she had a growing feeling that she wanted to be next. She felt her pussy tingle as she waited for her turn. It felt weird, so she stayed back and did not say anything. Hoping her friend would not think she was a freak for her new feelings. 

<P> “I guess I didn’t think of it like that,” Lucy said a little confused, but kept tossing her friend into the air. “Ginger, do you feel any different?”

<P> “I don’t know… it is hard to get my bearings when you keep tossing me int…” cut off as Lucy missed a catch and Ginger fell right to the ground. She gave off a surreal puffy plop. After hitting the ground bottom first, she fell back onto her back. “Dam it Lucy, be more careful next time.”

<P> “Oh, I am so sorry,” Lucy asked as she looked down at her friend. “Well it wasn’t really my fault. You’re the one who let your arms disappear,” Lucy pointed to Ginger’s arms. Like her legs before them, they had shrunk back into her shoulders. They were practically gone by then. As soon they too shrunk back into her shoulders and the areas changed as well. Soon her shoulders were simply round, surrounded with frills, and had a big bow in the center. Her enter outfit has changed a little. It was now a solid green, still with lace designs, but no longer sheer. Her pussy had moved to the outside of her outfit, but the lips were simpler. Just two simple mounds that were green and part of what was once her lingerie outfit surrounded by two frills. She had frills going up her side and two small green bows had appeared where her nipples were as well as two more in her hair. “It is kind of weird, and stylish…” Lucy commented after the change was done.

<P> “She does look pretty… A little less sexy, but pretty,” Heather said as she reached down to pick up her friend. Without realizing what she had done, she squeezed her friend, but Ginger’s body simply gave to her hands. “That’s funny,” Heather said as she kept squeezing different parts. “She is like… soft… and squishy.”

<P>Lucy joined in and reached over, squeezing Ginger’s chest, “yea… and her skin feels like fabric. Really soft fabric,” she soon stopped squeezing and started rubbing her hand across Ginger’s bust line. 

<P>“Her teddy feels the same way,” Heather said as she took a step forward and put Ginger down on the bench. She backed away and stared on with Lucy. Ginger was motionless, with a smile on her face and blank eyes that just stared ahead. “I think she is a pillow. Ginger turned into a pillow.”</p>
