<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Look, man, I seriously stuck my neck out to even get you this chance at joining the frat <br />
in the first place. You’ve seen what other frats do for hazing. You should thank me!”<br />
<br />
Chris looked dubiously at the jockstrap and tube socks. His rich black hair was cut back <br />
into a fade on the sides to expose the glasses that sat firmly on his nose. “Look, Jack, I know you <br />
want to be able to hang out more, but this—”<br />
<br />
“Is easy compared to what I had to deal with,” Jack said seriously. His blond stubble and <br />
blocky face had only become more prominent and masculine over the last year since he joined <br />
the frat. “Nu Phi Lambda’s seriously cool, man. They accept anyone, so long as they pass the <br />
test. You wear it to the party, hang with some of the guys for a while, meet the pres, and there <br />
you go!”<br />
<br />
“And the reason they’re being so easy on me is because…?”<br />
<br />
Jack rolled his eyes. “Because I asked them to. That, and I may have said this was the <br />
most embarrassing thing you’ll ever have to endure.”<br />
<br />
“So, you lied for me?”<br />
“You’re saying you won’t be uncomfortable wearing just that underneath your clothes?”<br />
“… Point.”<br />
Jack smirked. “See? I’ve still got those mad debate skills.”<br />
Chris rolled his eyes. “Sure, you do.”<br />
“Oh, and one more thing. They’re gonna be checking to make sure you’re actually <br />
wearing it, so be ready for some bros to give you a wedgie.” He chuckled. “Well, to try, <br />
anyway.”<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“It’s hazing, man. What’d you expect?”<br />
“Something that isn’t so immature?”<br />
Jack chuckled. “I’ll see you at the party, ‘little bro.’ Don’t be late,” he sang as he left the <br />
room.<br />
<br />
Chris groaned as he looked at the two articles of clothing. “The things I do for <br />
friendship,” he muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
Well, Jack hadn’t been wrong. The discomfort was definitely there. Every step Chris took<br />
brushed the fabric of his jeans against parts of his body that weren’t used to such exposure, and the straps of the strap would rub occasionally against his skin. He was confident he’d likely <br />
develop a rash by the end of the night. Or at the very least, chafe marks. He would have worn <br />
boxers over the gear to mitigate the situation, were it not for the warning Jack gave.<br />
<br />
Chris had only experienced a wedgie once before, when he was swimming in an old <br />
childhood friend’s pool. The yelp he’d given when he was lifted bodily in the water had echoed <br />
through the neighborhood, and he still winced whenever he thought back on the old memory. <br />
The tube socks he wore now encompassed his feet in a thick cocoon that pressed slightly against <br />
the walls of his shoes and sent a strange tingling sensation up the soles of his feet with every <br />
step. It wasn’t like he was being tickled, but it was certainly distracting.<br />
<br />
“Chris!” Jack grinned as he shouldered through the crowd of upperclassmen to reach his <br />
friend. “Glad you made it, bro!” The man had become the embodiment of the frat bro stereotype <br />
from the backwards snapback to the tight tank and shorts marked with the frat’s logo. Tanned <br />
and swollen arms nearly consumed the would-be-pledge in a bear hug that would break a lesser <br />
man. This was soon followed by a loud snap.<br />
<br />
Chris stiffened like a board as his eyes widened and he gaped disbelievingly at his friend.<br />
“Just checking.” Jack grinned. “Good on you for not bringing boxers.”<br />
“Jack….”<br />
“Oh, calm down, man. One night of immature revelry won’t kill you.” Jack rolled his <br />
eyes. “Come on. Pres is waiting.”<br />
<br />
The party had yet to get fully underway, so it was easy to weave or shoulder through <br />
people without consequence. Tall thick border hedges provided all the privacy the event would <br />
need, if not noise protection. As for what antics might come that night as a result of said <br />
privacy…. Chris didn’t want to think about it. The inside of the frat house was more like a <br />
mansion than a house, with rich dark wood floors and a brighter reddish paneling for the walls. <br />
Jack guided him to the left, where a pair of doors opened into a broad study lined with ornate <br />
bookshelves, complete with the moveable ladder. It was the picture of a Victorian manor study. <br />
And there, behind the desk, stood the tallest, broadest, and most imposing man Chris had ever <br />
laid eyes on.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Kyle! I brought him,” Jack announced. His face split into a broad grin. “Told you <br />
I’d get him here.”<br />
<br />
Kyle was a burly man with naturally wavy brown hair and thick eyebrows. His arms were <br />
nearly twice the size of Jack’s, and his green eyes were highlighted with a golden outline. Darker <br />
hairs stood out on the backs of his hands and along his arms before slipping under the tight <br />
sleeves of his polo. When the behemoth leaned onto the desk, Chris had the impression of staring <br />
down a gorilla, rather than a man.<br />
<br />
“So, this is the one you told me about, huh?” His voice was deep and gruff with just a <br />
hint of a growl that carried in the undertow. A heavy smack to the back sent Chris catapulting onto the desk. He braced for all he was worth to avoid accidentally knocking heads with the man that presumably would be the one to <br />
decide whether he was worthy of joining the organization in the first place.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t look like much,” Kyle continued bluntly.<br />
Jack folded his arms. “Neither did I when I pledged. Look at me now.”<br />
Kyle didn’t bother looking at Jack. His focus was on the man who couldn’t hold a gaze <br />
for a few seconds before looking away. “You wearing your gear?”<br />
“If you mean the jockstrap and socks, yes.” Chris’ cheeks felt like they were on fire as his <br />
voice hushed. “Are you guys seriously going to give me wedgies?”<br />
<br />
Kyle rose to his full height and folded his vascular arms. “Part of the deal. You could say <br />
that strap is more for protection than it is a test. Do right by it and you’ll fit in, no problem.” He <br />
strode around the table and extended a hand. “It’s tradition for the leader to welcome guests, <br />
even if they don’t pass snuff.”<br />
<br />
Chris’ whole hand was swallowed in the fist as Kyle shook with gentle controlled <br />
movements. The man probably could have broken his arm, if he’d been so inclined. A few <br />
second later, the familiar snap of spandex rang through the room. Chris yelped and jumped <br />
briefly. Kyle smiled. “Watch yourself tonight, pledge. Part of the fun is facing a challenge.”<br />
Chris glared at the man. “And here I thought I was actually going to like you.”<br />
Kyle huffed a chuckle. “You still might by the end of the night. Go on. Have fun. This <br />
party’s meant for more than just pranking. I want to see just how well you rush. Good luck.”</p>
