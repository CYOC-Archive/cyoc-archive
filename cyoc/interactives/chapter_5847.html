<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred had one hell of a battle keeping his mind from wandering off into the lusty desires of the beast. Even as he watched his Father walk back to the house he wanted to call out and begged to talk. Yet the sounds and scents around him caught a young mind off guard and soon he stood doing and acting the part of a bull.<br />
<br />
Although a bull can't tell time or even care about the utter thought of time, a teenager can. It was bad enough that his senses were so acqute, all of which made the beastial form a true distraction from thinking rational thoughts. Then too, the boredom of nothing to do but follow the strange sensations of those distractions.<br />
<br />
First a cold drink from the water trough and a choking as he had never tried to drink or swallow as a bull might. Lowering his head to gasp for air and cough as best a bull's form would allow made him want to be a boy very much.<br />
<br />
Time clicked by as the early morning finally went to midday. The sun warmed his black hairy hide and made him all too comfortable. The occasional sighting of his Father walking to and from the stables made Jarred perk up. The look on his Dad's face was definate not one of a pleased man. Indeed the young bull pleaded for food in the normal way a bull might, he lowed and bellowed his desires.<br />
<br />
At last his Mother came to the rescue and a quarter bale of hay was tossed over the fence for a bovine to relish. &quot;There beast you can be quiet! I have no idea what Jarred was thinking, why was a bull calf in my son's bedroom at five in the morning I don't know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jarred having been the only child was rather spoiled by his parents. The delight of gifts and presents, money and what have you were less then a thrill. So as the youth walked about now he had time to think about all those wonderful treasures.<br />
<br />
The heat of the day drove the bull part of Jarred to seek shade, but there was little to find in the open corral. A continued walk back to the trough had brought about his first true bodily need, a good pee. A boney tail rose to the occasion, as he turned his head to the right he heard a flood of splashing. The gaze of his right eye down to see what he barely had noticed. The rush of a hot stream from his sheath's end was in the business of making a small lake on the ground.<br />
<br />
The smell was raw and had a stinch like nothing he had ever been so close to sniff. Now though his nostrils picked up the scent and even as his human thoughts told him of the stink, the bullish mentality suggested one of peace a correlation with the word, home.<br />
<br />
Now somewhere in his thoughts Jarred began to realize he was rapidly losing his boyish rational thoughts. The word instinct was being given new meaning as each happening of the day passed him by. He had grazed on a quarter bale of hay and enjoyed it! He had learned to drink from a water trough as a beast, and rather enjoyed it now! The warmth of the sun on his black hairy hide offered a content feeling like nothing he'd thought to enjoy as a boy, but now he enjoyed it! The taking of a pee was always something to make fun about or just do, now he relished in the scent of his urine and loved the odd deeling of contentment he enjoyed. This being naked to the world at large was also a thrill. The hot or cold breezes flowed over the hair and tickled him as nothing he's even thought to try. All these strange and yet very neat feelings had made his first day of fond recollection.<br />
<br />
As a Police car drove into the driveway Jarred's human thought patterns jumped to attention. The wandering of his thoughts now made a reminder that he was missing and only a bull calf was found. He watched intently from the corral as the Policemen talked first with his Father and then Mom. They pointed toward him and he wishing to tell them how this happened began to bellar like a bull.<br />
<br />
The four grownup went into the house and after a long time and three drinks at the trough they came out again. Jarred watched intently but not one of the grown people took any notice or even a friendly gaze in his direction.<br />
<br />
As a quarter bale of hay dropped into the middle of the corral Jarred's bull self yelled, &quot;DINNER!&quot; and he dove' into the meal. Ears flicked as he munched the sweet morsels. The sound of his Father's voice was less than a distraction, but he lifted his head and continued to munch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Bull, you must be from the Killingsworth Farm!&quot; A thought that even Jarred had earlier in the day as that was the only farm in the county which bred Angus cattle.<br />
<br />
As the Celphone tinkled Jarred's Father grabbed it and began to talk. &quot;Hi John, yea I got one of your bull calves over here, must have wandered from your place somehow?&quot; Oh! Say again, he did well that explains why the bull is here but Jarred seems to have vanished! Yea, I'll hold him here till your truck comes over, and if you see Jarred tell him to come home or at least call, thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Jarred's Mother ran from the house no doubt in hope of a friendly call from the Police. &quot;Did they find him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No not yet, but the reason for the bull seems to be somewhat reasonable though! I just recieved a call from John Killingsworth. He tells me that Jarred had entered the 4-H club and was planning to enter a pet Aberdeen Angus calf in the ribbon contest, believe it! John said that Jarred has been coming over early in the mornings to ride and learn to rope cattle. Seems the calf bull there is his 4-H pet!  John will send word to his line shack and check if Jarred had stayed there overnight. This is some wild story and I'm sure Jarred will be surprised when he discovers we know of the big plans.&quot; explained Jarred's Father.<br />
<br />
Jarred stood munching on dinner but listening to all that transpired. The fact of his change from teenager to Angus bull made no sense when the odd stroy his Father recounted to the Misses. Somehow the Silver Buckle had changed history to match Jarred's disappearance? &quot;Wow!&quot; and then back to the dinner at hand.</p>
