<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wyatt sighed, a solemn expression upon his face as he studied numerous reports. The attack on the fae rattled all of the supernatural realms. From dragons, to kitsune, to even vampires, all now anxiously wondered what the Normal&#39;s next move would be. For Wyatt, these preparations weren&#39;t new. Since retaking the manor, he began strengthening his forces to prevent another incursion. It was also why he so willingly offered assistance to the fae. The young vampire lord realized that obtaining allies would only strengthen his position, something his predecessors never considered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Wyatt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt looked up, noticing his Aunt Hanoko Tepes enter his study. &quot;I was looking for Duke,&quot; she said, the dhamphirs yellow eyes settling on him. &quot;Duke and Sasha returned to the mortal realm a short time ago,&quot; he stated. &quot;He received a call from that dhamphir girl, Natalia. It sounded serious.&quot; Hanako nodded in response, she met Nat during the resistance attempt to retake the manor. For Hanako it was a surprise, another dhamphir, for over a century she thought she was alone. That idea was shattered in a few short hours as she met not only Natalia but her nephew, Duke, as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I can help you with?&quot; Wyatt asked. Hanako shook her head no, quizzically studying the vampire lord. &quot;Can I speak?&quot; she asked. Wyatt raised an eyebrow, curious as to what Hanako had to say. &quot;I&#39;ve been watching you Wyatt,&quot; she stated. &quot;You are an anomaly amongst previous Tepes Lords.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to actually care for more than your own legacy,&quot; she said. &quot;Unlike your father or even grandfather, you seem to put the needs of others in place of your own. As much as you may not like hearing this, you are very much like your brother.&quot; Wyatt frowned, despite a thawing in his relationship with Duke, he wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled to be compared to him. &quot;Before you lose your temper though,&quot; Hanako continued. &quot;I should mention that you also remind me of your great-grandfather, Dracula, at least the Dracula my father spoke of...before Lisa&#39;s death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Wyatt asked. Hanako took a breath, gazing at the young vampire lord intently. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told you about Dracula and Lisa.&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m aware they were married before having your father,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;After Lisa died though, Dracula began a genocide of humanity before your father destroyed him.&quot; Hanako nodded, a small smirk spreading across her face. &quot;That&#39;s only part of the story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt listened as Hanako spoke of the love between Lisa and Dracula. How a woman in the 15th century, from a small village, banged on the door of Dracula&#39;s castle until he let her in. She wanted to be a doctor and Dracula was intrigued by the woman&#39;s boldness. He showed her the lost knowledge of the ages, teaching her as the pair fell in love. Wyatt was aware of this. What he wasn&#39;t aware of was what Lisa was doing to Dracula.<br />
<br />
As their relationship persisted, Lisa began to show Dracula that humanity was worth more than he gave it credit for. She showed him the beauty that could be mortal man, which Dracula slowly began to embrace, for the love of Lisa. Eventually, after having a son, Lisa encouraged Dracula to travel. To see that humanity wasn&#39;t as ugly as the ancient vampire believed. If the church hadn&#39;t taken Lisa&#39;s life, Hanako was convinced that Dracula could change the world for the better. &quot;It was a broken promise,&quot; Hanako said. &quot;Think of it. If humans hadn&#39;t proved Dracula&#39;s worst instincts true, the vampires could have helped usher in a golden age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea,&quot; Wyatt said in awe. &quot;But why tell me?&quot; Hanako smirked, staring into the young vampires eyes. &quot;Because that promise is still possible,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve watched you carefully Wyatt. I at first thought you were a spoiled brat who wanted power and prestige, but I was wrong. I&#39;ve seen the way you care for your family and your people. Maybe, you could be the leader my father thought vampires deserved. Maybe, with Duke&#39;s help, you could usher in a golden age for humanity.&quot; Wyatt paused, taking in his aunt&#39;s words carefully. The idea of bettering humans and vampires had never crossed his mind. Did he have it in him to be a savior to both?<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Wyatt,&quot; a guard stated as he entered his study. &quot;The portal from S.P.E.A.R has been activated.&quot; Wyatt nodded, excusing himself as he journeyed toward the portals entrance. He wasn&#39;t expecting a visit from S.P.E.A.R. Perhaps Sarah had news about the Normal. As he entered the room, he raised an eyebrow in surprise as Caleb Moreland exited. &quot;Moreland,&quot; he asked in surprise. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb&#39;s face was emotionless, his eyes narrowed as he glared at the vampire lord. Reaching into a bag, Caleb now tossed the severed head of Hannibal at Wyatts feet. &quot;You wanna explain this your highness?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt was stunned. Hannibal, a trusted advisor and loyal servant to the Tepes family lay dead at his feet. &quot;What is this? What have you done Moreland!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was going to ask you the same question,&quot; Caleb growled. &quot;This son of bitch attacked me and crippled my brother!&quot; Wyatt gawked. Hannibal attacking the Moreland family? &quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; Wyatt gasped. &quot;Hannibal would never do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did and he said you ordered it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt could feel himself go pale. He now understood why Caleb had come. &quot;Caleb listen to me,&quot; Wyatt said quickly. &quot;I did not order Hannibal to attack you. There must be an explanation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explanation?!&quot; Caleb roared. &quot;Dont give me that Wyatt. We both know better than anyone that someone like Hannibal isn&#39;t going to so much as shit without your permission! So, one more time, why did you go after Connor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt gulped, Caleb wasn&#39;t wrong when he characterized Hannibal. The elite vampire wouldn&#39;t have done this without permission. The only problem was that Wyatt had given no such order. Hannibal had gone rogue and Wyatt needed to explain that. Taking a breath, Wyatt now tried to appeal to Caleb&#39;s better nature. &quot;Caleb listen to me,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I swear on my family I had nothing to do with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb seethed, Wyatt&#39;s words doing little to soothe his rage. The mentioning of family is what caused the young hunter to snap. With a roar of pain and rage, Caleb darted forward delivering a massive hook to Wyatts face. &quot;YOU DARE TALK ABOUT FAMILY?!!!&quot; Caleb screamed. &quot;My father! My brother! Both maimed by your family!&quot; Caleb delivered a series of strikes, battering the young vampire lord. The sound of Caleb&#39;s strikes drawing two guards to Wyatt&#39;s aid.<br />
<br />
As Caleb continued to beat Wyatt, he noticed movement out of the corner of his eye. Quickly removing his pistol, he fired four shots, hitting the guards in the head and chest. The guards quickly crumbled to dust as Caleb now pistol whipped Wyatt. &quot;FIGHT BACK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a guilty man would fight back Caleb,&quot; Wyatt said, spitting out blood. &quot;I did not attack your brother. If it means you beating me to death to prove it....so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb roared, continuing to pistol whip Wyatt. The vampires face was a bloody mess. One of Wyatt&#39;s eyes swelling shut as his broken nose bled heavily. The look of pure rage on Caleb&#39;s face was frightening, Wyatt not putting up a fight only enraged the young hunter even more. He could see Wyatt was now barely conscious, his face bloody and bruised from the assault. One last fury would end the vampire lord once and for all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb&#39;s eyes went wide, his face a look of shock as a young vampire boy ran towards his father. &quot;Andrew,&quot; Wyatt wheezed through a broken jaw. &quot;No...get..back!&quot; Andrew though wouldn&#39;t listen, the toddler screaming as he ran towards Caleb, striking him with futile blows. &quot;You monster!&quot; the boy cried, flailing at Caleb with ineffective blows. &quot;Leave my daddy alone bad guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb paused in his attack, stunned by this young boy&#39;s actions. Glancing first at Wyatt then his own bloody hands, he stood before backing away. &quot;Caleb, what are you doing!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb turned, shocked to see Sarah pointing her gun at him. &quot;Back away Caleb,&quot; she said, flicking the safety off her weapon. &quot;I&#39;m warning you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah?&quot; Caleb said in confusion before shaking himself out of his stupor. &quot;Sarah what the hell? Wyatt attacked my family! Connor&#39;s in the hospital right now, he needs to answer for his crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one I see committing a crime is you Caleb,&quot; Sarah growled. &quot;You attacked a leader of the vampire nation. Under S.P.E.A.R guidelines I should be arresting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrest me?&quot; Caleb exclaimed in confusion, his rage now focusing on Sarah. &quot;Arrest me!?! The Tepes family keeps attacking MY FAMILY and you&#39;re just turning a blind eye?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s the case an investigation will be conducted,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;That is if Wyatt doesn&#39;t press charges.&quot; Caleb turned red with anger, gritting his teeth as he looked back at Wyatt. &quot;We&#39;ll finish this later,&quot; he growled before turning back to Sarah.<br />
<br />
Before Sarah or Caleb could leave, the door swung open and Kyra came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, where did you....WYATT!!!&quot; Kyra exclaimed as she rushed over to her husband&#39;s side and kneeled down beside him with little Andrew looking worried.<br />
<br />
Kyra looked up at Caleb with anger in her eyes. &quot;What did you do? You come into my home and attack my husband for no reason?!&quot; Kyra asked angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s the short version, your highness: Your so-called &#39;noble husband&#39; sent Hannibal after me and crippled my brother who&#39;s in the hospital, right now. There&#39;s his head if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot; Caleb said pointing to the decapitated head.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t seen nor talked to him in days before this. Now you come in and accuse my husband of something he didn&#39;t do? In front of our own child?!&quot; Kyra said with anger starting up in her voice. &quot;Hear me Moreland, anyone with your name is now banned from ever returning to our lands! Now get out and leave us to tend to my husband&#39;s wounds.&quot; Kyra said as she kneeled back down to Wyatt and comforted her son Andrew, she was just thankful the other children hadn&#39;t seen their father like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done here.&quot; Pushing past Sarah, Caleb spit on the floor as he exited through the portal, leaving behind a battered Wyatt and confused Sarah to figure out what happened.</p>
