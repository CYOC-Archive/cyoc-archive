<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was about a week later, that Mark and Mike returned to the former Aidan´s flat for the first time. The week itself had been fun and interesting to the both of them. With Mike being established, nobody knew he hadn´t existed prior. Everyone knowing Mark now also knew Mike, and they had all the same friends. They had much fun confusing others by switching places or continuing each other’s sentences.<br />
But in a way they missed having Aidan around, so that was why they now were back in his flat. They had realized that they both had a crush on Aidan, or better said, Mark had one before unknowingly, which Mike had gained as he was created.<br />
“We still need to decide from where we get a new Aidan, Mark. I don´t want to be turned back into him, and I guess you won´t be turned into him either, right?” Mike stated, and Mark nodded.<br />
“No, we can´t use either of us for this. Which points out another problem. If there are two of us, both with a crush on him, we will get problems with each other.” Mark answered while starting the laptop.<br />
“As Aidan would have been happy with getting a brother, why not make two “Aidans” instead of one? He gains the brother he wanted to get, and we can both have one of them as our mate?” Mike suggested with a grin.<br />
Mark nodded again. “Yeah, that would solve our problem and be a nice apology to Aidan for being non-existent for a week. Problem is, we don´t know what to make one from, let alone two.” Mark sighed. But looking around, he spotted the solution for this situation.<br />
“How about we use a pair of Aidan´s older shoes? He won´t miss them, and as there are two of them, we have our base for his bodies?” Mark then suggested with a grin.<br />
“If that is enough to make him the bodies, okay, as long as he isn´t stuck in the size of them. But wouldn´t it be weird, knowing we kiss or have sex with what basically is a pair of shoes?” Mike answered to the suggestion.<br />
“What the base was won´t be bothering us afterwards, I guess. After all, I have no problem knowing you used to be my crush before, right? Hell, I could just make us forget what exactly we used as a base object, only knowing it was one. We could end up thinking we bought something to change him from, and without remembering, there would be no problem.” Mark explained, and Mike had to agree, it wouldn´t really matter to him.<br />
“You are right, but let us not forget it, we can still do that later if it bothers us too much, right? We just won´t tell Aidan or his twin.” Mike said and got over to Aidan´s shoe-corner, selecting a well-worn pair of them. It was also a size smaller than the others, so most likely won´t fit Aidan anymore anyway.<br />
“What do you say, should we give our new Aidan-twin-bases a present before changing him?” Mark said with a wicked grin, and Mike quickly joined in.<br />
“Great idea. Maybe use it to give him a crush on us as well.” Mike answered. And with that being said, both grabbed one of the shoes, pulled down their jeans and boxers, and masturbated a big load into the shoes that would soon become the Aidan-twins.<br />
The climaxed exactly the same moment, and without anything said, unloaded completely into the shoes, flooding them in their cum. And, without either of them realizing it in their afterglow, also let a bit of their piss trickle into the shoes, further marking them.<br />
<br />
Around ten minutes later, they had everything back under control. The shoes, still full of their cum and piss, stood half a meter apart on the ground, and Mark had scanned them. He overwrote the data of the shoes with the back-up from Aidan, creating identical twins out of them. “Any wishes you have for your twin, Mike?” Mark asked.<br />
“No, let them be like us, with no difference. Much more fun that way.” Mike answered grinning from the couch. He trusted his twin after all.<br />
And Mark let them be identical. He just added a few small details into their profiles, letting his meaner thoughts decide for a bit. For one, they would always taste what was now inside of their “mouth”, meaning right now their body. Both Aidan and his twin would always taste their own feet, their “partners” cum and piss, the latest not realized by Mark. But they would never say that to anyone, keeping it secret. And nobody else would notice that taste, as it was completely in their imagination.<br />
Their sense of smell would also remained them of what they had been without them really knowing. They would always smell feet, even have a small craving to lick some feet. But they would never ask anyone but each other, or maybe later their partner in form of Mark or Mike.<br />
Lastly, the only real difference between them, they would have a crush on the twin that had cummed into their shoe-body before, as if being marked by them to be their mate in the end. And no change could be made to these select things by Aidan or his twin. They would even be hidden from them if they used the chronivac themselves. Grinning, Mark started the process of changing the shoes into the new twin-versions of Aidan.<br />
<br />
As Mark and Mike watched, both shoes started to expanded. The shoes didn´t change into Aidan´s body, but it builds around them, leaving the opening end up as their mouths, their inside being the inside of it. The shoes tongue turned into the new tongue inside the new mouth. Above the opening, from the small tag just above the hole, formed the new nose, while the edge around the hole turned into Aidan´s new lips. Growing above were the rest of their heads, all coming seemingly from nothing. Closed, hazel eyes formed, and black hair grew in around the whole head.<br />
From the tip of the shoe their whole new body started to form. First a neck, then a chest and stomach. Arms grew in from the old laces wrapped around the shoe, one of the only things repurposed from the old body. Further down the expanding mass went, expanding into an impressive set of cock and balls for each twin. And with the legs and feet growing in, the new bodies were finished being created.<br />
The still lifeless bodies shuddered ad the newly formed brains got filled with everything making Aidan himself, and after just a few seconds of laying lifeless on the ground, both bodies “booted up”. With “waking up”, both versions of Aidan gulped down the still inside mix of cum and piss, making them splutter a bit as they blinked away tears from their eyes.<br />
“What the hell, Mark? What have you done to me?” asked both versions of Aidan at the same time, remembering being erased out of their bodies. Only then did they realize the echo the had gotten. Both versions of Aidan looked sidewards, towards each other, and a second later you could literally see their mouths hit the floor. “What?”<br />
Mark and Mike laughed at that. Both Aidans were too shocked to say anything else, but heard when Mark finally answered. “You see, Aidan, after I turned you into my twin, and we enjoyed this for a week, we decided to return you to existence. But as neither of us wanted to cease to exist, we remade your body from an object. And seeing as you would have been happy with me as your brother, we decided to give you a twin as well. Hope you like each other.”<br />
That was when Aidan, or better, both versions of Aidan, took notice of Mike, sitting on the couch still laughing at them. A look sidewards showed Mark at the laptop, the returned to look at each other, stunned to silence.<br />
<br />
Maybe ten minutes later the Aidan who had drunk Mark´s cum asked, bewildered: “You made two versions of me, and none of us is in our old body, as that is still your twin?”<br />
“Yeah, I´m in your “original” body, Aidan. And I´m called Mike, by the way. Nice to meet this body´s old inhabitant. Sorry, but I like being in existence too much to be changed back into you.” Mike explained grinning. “Maybe you should think about how to name each other, as there can only be one Aidan, right?”<br />
After another minute of thinking about that, the Aidan who had drunk Mike´s cum answered: “Well, then I will be called Alex. Is that okay for you, Aidan? Or do you want another name?”<br />
“No, it´s okay, Alex. And I must say, I like that name.” Aidan answered, grinning at his twin.<br />
“You are basically the same person, it´s no wonder you like the name as well, Aidan.” Mark said with a little laugh. Both Aidan and Alex turned slightly red at that, embarrassed.<br />
“Hey, you don´t need to be embarrassed, Mark and I did the same, just without a witness. Now, as much as I like the eye-candy you both are, how about you get some clothes on? Mark, should we head home, or do you think we should go out together with our new twin-friends?” Mike said grinning, only implying it like a double-date.<br />
Now both Aidan and Alex got even redder, not having thought about still being naked. Mark thought about Mike´s question. “Well, it´s up to Aidan and Alex. I just need to first reinstall Aidan as a living person, and make sure Alex exists alongside him. Luckily, I made that back-up as well last week.”<br />
That peaked Aidan´s curiosity, having not heard it the first time. “What do you mean, last week? Have you waited a whole week to recreate me?”<br />
Again, Mike answered for them. “While Mark made sure to have your back-up saved, Aidan, we didn´t think about recreating you instantly. Even now, there was another reason as to just remake you, that being us missing you being around. And for Alex, as Mark explained, we created him as an apology for this whole mess. From Mark´s memory, I know how happy you would have been with a brother, so it seemed fitting to give you one too.”<br />
While Aidan was silent now, Alex said: “Well, I would like to go out with you both. I will get something to wear. You coming, Aidan?”<br />
With that, Alex and Aidan got up and walked into their bedroom, while Mark reinserted them into reality. It had the added bonus that it created copies of most thing Aidan had, just like it had for him and Mike. It wouldn´t do if either Aidan or Alex had to sleep on the couch, after all.<br />
Ten minutes later, Aidan and Alex returned, ready to go out, and soon the four of them headed out to their double-date, even if neither Aidan nor Alex saw it as such for now.</p>
