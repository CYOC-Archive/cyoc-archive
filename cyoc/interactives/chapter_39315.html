<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Jennifer couldn't think. Half of her mind was racing over the possibilities choosing either "Transform" or "Dare" would bring. The other half was closed to her, restricted by the evils of the curse. What was more problematic was that Jennifer didn't know which parts of her brain were blocked off until her train of thought ran into them. All of this was made even harder by a growing heat from her privates that begged to be dealt with.
<P>"Time's up," the boy said to her over the phone. Jennifer cursed to herself. She'd been so busy thinking she'd forgotten WHY she was thinking. "You must either be desperate for me to lift all aspects of your curse, or you can't think well enough after all."
<P>"I can think just fine!" Jennifer yelled into the receiver. "I'm not, like, some dork who spends all his time, like, alone at home thinking about stupid curses!"
<P>"Do you want me to help you or not?"
<P>Jennifer fell silent.
<P>"Okay then, let's think about how your dare is going to go. Just to be on the safe side, I'll dare you to obey my every command until this call is over. First off, don't hang up the phone until I say so."
<P>Jennifer hadn't planned on it, but once he mentioned it, it seemed like a good idea. She wished she was smarter so she would have thought to do it before he ordered her not to. That stupid jerk.
<P>"I'm going to give you your transform now, so listen up. Every time you answer a question incorrectly, or answer with a phrase like 'I don't know,' you will change a little bit into a dog until you've become a half-girl, half-dog. You'll also start developing doggy behavior. Nobody but the two of us will think this is unusual, and will act as if you've always been part dog, and the world will change to fit your new life."
<P>"That's sick," Jennifer sneered.
<P>"I know," the boy said. "By the way, what time is it?"
<P>"Time to, like, get a life! Who cares what the stupid time is?"
<P>"Just testing."
<P>Jennifer suddenly felt a strange pulling sensation in her ears. She scratched at one and nearly screamed when she felt fine hairs covering it. She took the cordless phone she was holding with her into the bathroom. There, she saw two pointed ears covered in sandy fur sticking out of her hair. They were twice the size they were supposed to be.
<P>"What the hell did you do to me?!" she screamed.
<P>"What did you think I did to you?" came the reply.
<P>"I don't know! That's why I'm asking you!" She'd no sooner stopped talking when the ears on the girl in the mirror grew even larger and flopped over. They now clearly resembled fuzzy dog ears.
<P>"Let me guess...you changed again? What happened? Was it the nose, or your paws?"
<P>"It was my ears," Jennifer said, finally catching onto what was happening.
<P>"Nice. Okay, now that we know the transformation is working, I would like you to do me a few favors. Are you in your room?"
<P>"No."
<P>"Go there, if you please."
<P>Jennifer found herself walking up the stairs without hesitation. She tried with all her might to stop, to turn around, to hang up the phone...anything. But she strode right up and into her bedroom. Once inside she closed the door.
<P>"What do you, like, want with me?" she asked. "Please just let me go. Change me back."
<P>"I'm not convinced you've learned your lesson," the boy said. "So I'm going to let your original curse go a little farther. Put down the phone without hanging it up. Give yourself three orgasms right now, then pick up the phone again for more orders.
<P>Jennifer was partly relieved to do as she was told. The pulsing of her sex was finally going to be quelled. She slid onto her bed and pulled her pants halfway off. She jammed her fingers up her moist slit until she came, then came again, then again. The dare seemed to help her along, as each orgasm was reached faster than she was used to. Each one was also more amazing than the last, but with their passing, Jennifer found her need for more was compounded. She quickly trust her hand into herself again, coming for the fourth time. Finally, she was too exhausted to continue, though she wanted to keep going like nothing else in the world mattered.
<P>She reached with her clean arm and shakily grabbed the...the thing that she couldn't remember the name of. The thing that you talked into to hear someone from far away. She held it to her ear. "I'm...I'm back," she whispered.
<P>"Was that good for you?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>"Good. I'm glad you were able to enjoy it one last time."
<P>"Whu...?" Jennifer's mind was so cloudy with lust she barely heard the boy's words.
<P>"I order you to never get yourself off again. Ever. From now on, the only way you can satisfy your sexual needs is with the help of others."
<P>"No. No, please!" Jennifer felt her hand automatically slide away from her pussy lips. She tried to force it to go back, but couldn't get it closer than an inch away from her crotch without her muscles locking up and cramping. "Please... I need it! I need it!"
<P>"No," the boy said darkly. "You just want it really, really badly. If you finally start admitting the error of your bitchy ways, before you become a real bitch, a real slut, or both, you should stop by my house and I might actually give you another shot at living a normal life. No matter how stupid you eventually get, I order you to remember the following information: My name is Kyle Perkins. I live at 654 Seventh Street. Come by when you're ready to say you're sorry. And remember, I'll know if you're lying." The phone clicked and went silent.</p>
