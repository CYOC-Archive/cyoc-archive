<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dalton winced as his stomach growled.  After having stood in line for over an hour, he was quite peckish.  He&#39;d also missed lunch.  He hoped he could find a decent meal at the fair.<br />
<br />
As he wandered the fairgrounds, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a little self conscious in his morphsuit.  He had a skinny build, not too athletic, but not terribly scrawny, either.  He did feel better, though, as he observed the hundreds of other park goers all wearing morphsuit, each one a unique color and pattern.  He realized this was probably a way of keeping track of all the visitors.  If their physical bodies were constantly changing, they could still be identified by their unique morphsuit.  He observed a woman in a green and white floral print suit, a man in a red and black checkerboard suit, and even a little boy wearing a rainbow patterned suit.  Looking closer, he noticed the boy had a burro&#39;s tail and was covered in gray fur.  Dalton shivered at the bizarre sight.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he came across the rows of food trucks, parked by the side of the walkways.  They all had strange names painted on their sides.  Also, seeing as it was around lunch time, they had very long lines.  Dalton groaned to himself.  He didn&#39;t want to have to wait in line again.  He&#39;d just gotten out of one.  His spirits lifted when he saw one with no people in front of it.  He didn&#39;t care how good the food was at this point.  He just wanted to eat.  The track was painted with the name &quot;Fat Larry&#39;s&quot;.<br />
<br />
Circling around to the window, Dalton saw a bored looking overweight man in an apron, leaning on the counter.  When he spotted Dalton he stood up straight and plastered a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
The man leaned out the window, his oversized stomach pressing on the counter.  &quot;Hey, young man!  You hungry for some grub?  We got your eats right here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton approached the window.  &quot;Erm, yeah.  Sure.  What&#39;ve you got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Going over the menu, Dalton saw it was like most carnival food stands.  They had hamburgers, hot dogs, funnel cakes, and even deep fried candy bars.  Dalton ordered himself a hamburger with a side of fries and a soft drink.<br />
<br />
Dalton took his meal to a nearby table and took a bite of his burger.  He couldn&#39;t believe it!  It was probably the best burger he&#39;d ever tasted.  How was it possible this guy didn&#39;t have the longest line of all the food trucks?  Dalton tried the fries next.  They were equally as exquisite.  He never thought he&#39;d ever have deep friend potato straws as delicious as these.  He quickly began to snarf down his food, somehow feeling a little hungrier than before.  He forced himself to slow down, so as not to choke on his own food.<br />
<br />
Dalton swallowed the last remnants of his burger and fries, washing it all down with a sip of his soda.  It was possibly the best meal he&#39;d ever eaten.  Despite his hunger from before, he felt positively full, maybe even a little bloated.  He patted his sated stomach.  Though, something felt wrong.<br />
<br />
He glanced down and was surprised to see a curve to his stomach.  Maybe there was more to that meal than he had thought.  He froze when he saw the curve in his stomach was growing steadily larger.<br />
<br />
After recovering from his initial shock, Dalton stumbled off of the bench, clambering to his feet.  His skinny stomach had become a small paunch, which was on its way to becoming a gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that burger treating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton turned to see the overweight guy from the Fat Larry truck grinning at him from the window.<br />
<br />
Dalton quickly made his way back to the truck, feeling the weight steadily slide onto his body.  &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man chuckled.  &quot;What do you mean, son?  This is the Transformation Fair!  What did you think would happen?  Practically everything here induces some sort of change.  My truck specializes in fat gaining recipes.  Not the most popular change, I&#39;ll admit, but it sure gets the job done.<br />
<br />
Dalton watched his his stomach pushed out on front of him.  His rear end extended out behind him, keeping him from toppling over.  His thighs and even his arms joined in, softening and plumping up.  He watched in the truck&#39;s sideview mirror as his face rounded out, giving him chubby cheeks and the beginnings of a second chin.  He watched in dismay as his chest softened, giving him a pair of moobs.  His gut folded over his waistline as he formed love handles, accentuating his weight gain.  Finally, the changes slowed and stopped.  Dalton had gone from a fairly average build, to being definitely fat.<br />
<br />
Dalton reached down and jiggled his own stomach, feeling the weight of it.  &quot;I can&#39;t stay like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man in the truck frowned, looking a little offended.  &quot;Hey, it&#39;s your fault.  You should&#39;ve known what you were getting in to.  Anyway, none of this is permanent.  They put that microchip under your skin when you first entered, didn&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll be fine.  That&#39;ll turn you right back once you leave the fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton sighed, a little relieved.  &quot;Right.  I guess.  But, still, I don&#39;t want to spend the whole day like this.&quot;  He&#39;d already started to sweat a little more under his new layer of adipose.<br />
<br />
The man in the truck rolled his eyes and leaned out the window toward Dalton, his hefty stomach pressing against the counter.  &quot;Alright, kid, calm down.  If you think you can stomach more food, which I doubt you can, there&#39;s a diet food truck down the way a bit.  Some of their stuff makes you lose weight.  Be careful, though.  A little too much of that and you could blow away in the wind.  There&#39;s also this trivia game show that you can bet physical aspects.  If you think you know your trivia, you might be able to saddle some other poor shmuck with that new belly o&#39; yours.  If it were me, though, I&#39;d stick with it for a little while.  You may find that having a little extra ain&#39;t so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton thanked the man and hefted his new bulk away from the food truck.  He was at a loss.  The man in the truck had made some good suggestions, but maybe there was some other option.  What to do now...?</p>
