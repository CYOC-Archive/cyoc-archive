<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, magic fountain, I wish there was a cute boy here with me right now, who was totally, uncontrollably hot for me.”<br />
<br />
“No!” said Kelly as Karen chuckled and threw the coin in the fountain.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled. “Granted.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Karen didn’t know what was about to happen because of that wish, but she had a feeling that it wouldn’t be good. Her eyes searched for the coin her former mother had just thrown into the fountain. She wanted to dive in and take the coin back, but it was already lost amongst all the rest. Then, she felt a funny sensation wash over her. Her head felt foggy and her body seemed to tingle all over.<br />
<br />
“No,” she said. “Oh, no.”<br />
<br />
She started to grow. It was an unmistakable feeling, even if it was something she had never felt before. She felt herself getting taller. She felt her muscles begin to swell and get thicker, more solid. At the same time, she felt other things get smaller. Her breasts flattened out as her pecs grew to fill their place, and her ass seemed to deflate and firm up into a tight pair of buns.<br />
<br />
Then, she felt a stirring between her legs. There was a sensation of being turned inside out, like a sock being pulled through itself. Where there had been a hole, there was now something hanging there. Something she was afraid to name.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” she asked, and noticed that her voice had become much deeper. Then, an invigorating new sense of physical power filled her, a feeling like she could take on the world.<br />
<br />
Her skirt reformed itself into a pair of board shorts, while her T-shirt, well, it was still a T-shirt.<br />
<br />
“No,” she said as she felt the tingle stop and the changes stop with it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, no, no,” she moaned, realizing that she wasn’t speaking with the voice of a SHE anymore. She had the voice of a HE now.<br />
<br />
Kelly looked down at himself. He seemed to be a few inches taller than he had been, although he seemed not to have gotten older. How he knew that, he couldn’t say. He just felt fourteen still, although a tall, muscular fourteen.<br />
<br />
“You alright, Kelly?” said Karen, startling him.<br />
<br />
Kelly had all but forgotten about his former mother after the shock of his changes. When he looked her in the eyes, there was surprising a sense of longing there that he had never felt before. Karen was gorgeous, shockingly so. His eyes wandered over her body. He had never seen anything as beautiful as her before, from her plump lips to her pert breasts to her skinny waist and round hips to her long gorgeous legs. And her eyes… They said she wanted him, and, strangely, he felt like he wanted her back.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be happening,” he said, turning away from her with his hands covering his eyes, trying to blot out the sight of her along with the uneasy longing for her. He sat back down on the fountain’s edge. “This has got to be a dream or something.” He felt her sit next to him and realized that he could smell her. Even her scent was beautiful. She draped an arm around his back and pulled in close to him. Her touch was so sensual, so loving. He felt a strange stirring between his legs again.<br />
<br />
“Honey, you’re worrying me,” said Karen. “Do you need me to get help or something?”<br />
<br />
Kelly put down his hands and stared off across the park, consciously avoiding looking at Karen again. He tried to remind himself that she was really his mother. Also, he tried to ignore the swelling between his legs, a strange stiffing sensation.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that feels so wrong.”<br />
<br />
“What does?” asked Karen. “Should I get you some water or something?”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s nothing,” he said. “I’m fine. I just…” He shivered at the sound of his own voice, so deep. There was now something very solid protruding between his legs. It felt warm and wonderful straining against the fabric of his shorts. He tried not to think of the P word. “Oh, this is too weird.”<br />
<br />
“Kelly, look at me.”<br />
<br />
He turned and stared her in the eyes; they were a strange shade of grey, almost green. It was funny. He had never noticed that before back when they had been mother and daughter. Somehow, the color of her eyes seemed so much more important, more interesting.<br />
<br />
She put a hand on his cheek, and for the first time he noticed that there was light stubble there now under her smooth hand. “You look like you’re freaking out. Talk to me.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” he said and paused trying to figure out how to ask his former mother if she had noticed him turn into a boy. “Did you not notice anything… strange just happen?”<br />
<br />
“You mean, like how you started to look dizzy, like you were going to pass out or something?”<br />
<br />
“Uh,” he smiled. “Before that.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she said and let her hand drop from his cheek. He immediately missed her touch on his face. “We were just standing here, talking about dating and wishing fountains or something, and then you got all weird.”<br />
<br />
“Right,” he said. “Great. So, I’m the only one who remembers.”<br />
<br />
“Remembers what?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” he said, realizing that he was truly alone even with her next to him. “It’s nothing.”<br />
<br />
Karen raised a suspicious eyebrow, momentarily looking like her old motherly self. “Nothing, huh? Sure. Do you need to go home or something? ‘Cause you’re really freaking me out.”<br />
<br />
“Home?” he said, his mind racing at the thought of how his world had turned upside down in just a few minutes. “God, I don’t even know what home is going to be like now.”<br />
<br />
Kelly stared off into the distance again. He knew that he was supposed to try to fix this situation, to try to turn things back to normal. He pulled a coin out of his pocket. One wish and he could fix this, and everything would be back to normal. But, he hesitated. His mouth seemed to dry up, and suddenly he felt as though he was about to make the most important decision of his life. He wondered. Did he really want for things to go back to how they were, or did he really want the girl next to him more?<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted by the sweet touch of a pair of soft lips on his cheek. He turned to face her. They were inches apart. She felt so warm and inviting pressed up against him. He wanted her more than anything he had ever wanted. Somewhere in his mind, he knew that this was very very wrong. Some quiet little voice inside him screamed, “Don’t do it! This is your mother! Make a wish! Turn back to normal!”<br />
<br />
He ignored it. The coin slipped out of his hand.<br />
<br />
They kissed a long passionate kiss, the kind that makes people walking by blush. It was heaven, and she was his angel. Who cares if this is wrong? Kelly thought. Who cares if I’m not me anymore and she’s not herself anymore? What does anything else matter as long as we have each other?<br />
<br />
The stiffness in his crotch was begging for attention.<br />
<br />
“Karen,” he said gazing into her mysterious, beautiful eyes. “I think my Dad is supposed to be out of the house this afternoon.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” she said, and gave him a beautiful smile to match her eyes. “Does that mean we could be alone in your house?”<br />
<br />
He nodded.<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” she said. “What would we do all by ourselves in your empty house?”<br />
<br />
“Well…” he said with a mischievous smile. “I can think of one thing.”<br />
<br />
They stood up together with an arm wrapped around each other’s waist, and together they walked away in the same embrace.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled as she watched them go.<br />
<br />
“They make a cute couple,” she said to her hamster companion. “Honestly, I think they might even be happier this way than they had been. At least their relationship will be closer. Though, I hope they remember to use contraception. Teenage pregnancy can really put a damper on a relationship.”<br />
<br />
Todd the hamster just nibbled on a bit of cracker he had found in her purse.<br />
<br />
She nodded her head, “I actually feel like I did some good there. I’m not sure if I’m okay with that or not.” She shrugged her shoulders. “Oh, well. Who’s next?”</p>
