<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few moments later, the phone rings again. This time the man on the other end says his name is Fred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Fred, what's up?&quot; You ask in a chirpy tone, recognizing that he was a friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not much, I was just wondering if you could help me wash my car?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
You bite your lip, conflicted. If James was a boyfriend and washing a car really meant what he thought it did, then things could get ugly. Then again, Fred was bound to know you and James were going out, so he wouldn't have meant anything by it. Shrugging, you agree to it and quickly write a note to James saying you have gone out with some girl friends.<br />
<br />
It was boiling outside, perfect weather to wash a car, so you don't bother putting on any other clothes. You just drive barefoot in your underwear to Fred's house - which was on the car's GPS - and find him about to start washing his car.<br />
<br />
After greeting him and talking for a while, you grab the sponge and lean over the bonnet, but you're turned around by Fred, who puts a hand on your hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank's for coming out today Candy.&quot; He said, looking over your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, James said he was going to bed anyway.&quot; You reply, confident that you won't let this lead anyway. You may be in a woman;s body, but you definitely didn't plan on doing a woman's job. &quot;Could you please watch your hands?&quot; You ask as his right hand roams closer to your breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your skin is so soft.&quot; He whispers into your ear as he leans in close. The proximity is alarming now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Fred, you know I'm with James.&quot; You warn.<br />
<br />
But Fred just moves behind you. &quot;I know, but that doesn't mean we have to change at all, does it?&quot; What the hell does that mean??? You wonder, now alarmed. &quot;Besides, it would be a crime keeping these perky girls hidden from the world.&quot; He says, rubbing your breasts.<br />
<br />
A pleasurable sensation passed through your body, but you resisted its urges. &quot;Maybe this was a bad idea. We're here to wash the car, remember?&quot; To emphasize this you grab the sponge and lean in over the car, but are mortified when you feel his crotch rubbing against your backside.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a nice bumper you've got there.&quot; He said with a grin, causing you to bolt upright, but he just moves his hands to your breasts again. For some reason, you don't stop him as rolls your bra off your breasts and tucks it under them. His hands begin to fondle and squeeze your boobs. &quot;You see, your nipples enjoy the attention.&quot; He added as your nipples got stiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... this isn't right...&quot; You try to fight back, but you just stand there and let his hands roam.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it when *men* play with your boobies, don't you *Candy*?&quot;<br />
<br />
You are shocked when a different voice answers him. &quot;Yes, it feels so good!&quot; You moan in a sexy voice, like you were craving for more. Without realising what you were doing, you slide your panties off and throw them on top of the car. You hear fidgeting behind you and see that Fred is pulling out his dick. &quot;Oh my, what do you have there? Let me help you with that.&quot; You offer, rubbing your backside against his cock, making it stiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Candy, I can make you happy. Very happy.&quot; Without replying, you slowly turn towards him and lower yourself down, scooping up your boobs and pressing them against his cock. &quot;You like a nice cock on your boobies, don't you *girl*?&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't look up to acknowledge him, you just keep staring intently at your work as you heave your breasts up and down along his dick. &quot;Yes. You're making me so wet between my legs!&quot; Candy says with a small moan, and you realise that you are quickly losing control.<br />
<br />
Standing up, Candy pushes Fred back against the car. &quot;Why don't you just sit down and relax?&quot; She offers, getting on her knees.<br />
<br />
With a desperate surge of energy, you regain control of your body. Looking up, you see Fred looking down at you expectantly. You could still feel the waves of pleasure rolling through your body. They made you so horny, and Fred's words kept playing over in your mind. 'Men play with you boobies... you like a nice cock, don't you girl?' Looking down, you see his long, hard cock staring at you. With young small, petite hand, you reach out and grab the shaft. Opening your mouth wide, you lower it over his manhood and begin to suck.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good *girl*, Candy. You like my cock in your mouth, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response you just suck harder. Soon, he grabs the hair on the back of your head and helps you and before long you realised you were moaning! Like some slut in a porno, you were moaning as you sucked off one of your friends. You feel Fred go jerk and go stiff, and then he explodes in your mouth. Like a good girl, you swallow it all and even begin to lick his member clean afterward. Looking up smiling, strange thoughts began to pass through your head.<br />
<br />
'I know I was a guy for so long, but this just felt so good! It felt natural and fun. I can't believe how hot he makes me feel! <br />
<br />
As you kneel below him, still happily working on his cock, Fred smiles and leans in closer. &quot;That's a good girl, Candy. Don't you love the that cursed pair of underwear I left for you?&quot;</p>
