<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon entering the restaurant, Lexi took a moment to inform the doorman of her arival, and that she was now a +2, which with it being her party and all, wasn&#39;t an issue. Nodding, the doorman left to inform the guests of her arival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, before we go in, lets get in our positions&quot; announced Lexi, pushing Heather and Ophelia&#39;s backs. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should be in the center you know. Your party, your guests, so it should be your spotlight&quot; pointed out Heather as Lexi moved Ophelia into the center position, taking the back left side for herself. <br />
<br />
Heather, only getting Lexi to roll her eyes as she pushes her into the back right spot, finally accepted that she was never changing her mind, like usual. Out of their entire family, no one was more stubborn than her. But unlike with most people, it was part of her charm rather than a flaw. She was stubborn, but almost always to someone elses benefit, to which she mutually, though often indirectly, benefitted from. <br />
<br />
Heather could see her real objective with this stunt. For one, she wasn&#39;t wrong that fhe 2 of them, with their similar appearances, symmetrical dresses, and attractive figures, were ideal bookends for Ophelia&#39;s natural beauty, and exotic nature of being half dragon. <br />
<br />
Also, it definitely helped draw attention to their tops, since their skirts were not ment to be the focus. She knew very well what power large boobs held over others. Admittedly, even she had fallen so much in love with Ophelia&#39;s, that it was to the point she was heavily considering switching over to only using her breastmilk from now on. She would even cut out any diary replacements. Creamers, whole milk, hell, she was even planning to make homemade whipped cream made entirely from that delicious tittymilk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Heather, you know you are drooling right? Hello?&quot; Voiced a concerned Ophelia, trying to break Heather out of her own world. <br />
<br />
&quot;We dont have time for this&quot; voiced an impatient Lexi, while wiping clean Heather&#39;s mouth very carefully with her finger, so as not to ruin her makeup. Luckily, it was enough to bring her out of her daydream. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, oh. Sorry&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Think about fucking Ophelia later. I&#39;ll even help you at that time. But for now, places. Don&#39;t walk too fast. Don&#39;t trip. And make absolutely sure that you at least appear to be happy. If you can do that for just the first half hour, you&#39;re free. I won&#39;t stop you from doing as you wish at that point. I may even want to join you if it seems like fun.&quot; Lexi instructed, a little of her real thoughts slipping in at the end.<br />
<br />
It was then their official arival announcement aired over the P.A. system. &quot;Now announcing the arival of the guest of honor, accompanied by her VIP guests&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for sexy escorts or secret agents. We&#39;re VIPs now.&quot; Commented Heather to Lexi as they wait for the large double doors to be opened. <br />
<br />
&quot;I never knew events like these were so fancy!&quot; Ophelia exclaimed happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, you get use to it&quot; chuckled Lexi. <br />
<br />
The doors opened to reveal a sea of guests, tables, and shiny decorations. Everyone&#39;s eyes were pointing right at them, giving them their entire focus. Once they finally entered the room, everyone began clapping, while chearing and shouting their congratulations. <br />
<br />
However, almost as fast as it had started, the applause and chearing changed into subtle conversations, with many guests pointing at them, or rather, pointing at Ophelia. Some even had grabbed their notebooks and began making simple sketches or jotting down notes. Others took pictures or recorded video clips. <br />
<br />
The 3 of them just continued to walk forward. The sea of people moving out of their path as they went to their seats, which were in a private semi-circular booth centering on the back wall. Lexi would have originally been the only person besides her head designer and his wife. So having 2 others who she felt comfortable around join her was something she was very thankful for.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that she disliked him, or his wife, but rather, when together, they were not the easiest people to converse with. He would often just say random things her was thinking outloud, and his wife was incredibly shy to the point she struggled to answer questions she couldn&#39;t answer with a head nod. Lexi had heard her speak a few times, usually when she called her husband on the phone. But even then, the amount of people with similar experiences were so few in number that there still were rumors going around that she was a mute.<br />
<br />
So it was a rather big deal when she suddenly greeted them, and even more so when she further went and complemented Ophelia&#39;s ears. Yes, her ears. Her exact words being &quot;I just love your gorgeous ears! They complement your light skin and nearly white hair perfectly. Their purple color even looks beautifully when lined up against your black wings.&quot;<br />
<br />
But what had gotten everyone riled up wasn&#39;t what was said. It was how it was said. Unbeknownst to Ophelia and Heather, but clear as day to anyone within earshot of them, the women&#39;s complement had been spoken in an entirely different language, which not a single person could recognize. Even she was surprised by everyone&#39;s reaction, that is, until she too realized what she had just done. <br />
<br />
Feeling out of the loop, Heather and Ophelia looked at each other confused. Thankfully Lexi was their to inform them. <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounded so pretty! Tell me what language that was I want to learn it too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Again, now even more confused, they looked at each other while Ophelia mouthed &quot;Excuse me but what language did I just speak in?&quot; to the women who had just complemented her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Kyla. But I too am also a bit confused. But more so as to why you and your mate don&#39;t recognize the dragon&#39;s natural tongue, while yet completely understanding what was said. Could it be that you 2 were not born part dragons, but became them recently?&quot; Kyla said, also in the Dragon&#39;s language.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both recently became one&quot; Heather and Ophelia said simultaneously, also in dragon language.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even you know it sis? Teach me please&quot; begged Lexi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then welcome to the dragon race I guess. Don&#39;t worry, we are all friendly towards each other while on Earth, so please feel at ease to birth your clutch when the time comes. If you need assistance at handling the fully nursed hatchlings please let me know. I have a few contacts who would happily offer you their services, and even would pay you for it too. However I think we have caused more than enough commotion, so I will have end this welcomed conversation here. I don&#39;t speak english very well yet, so if you need to ask ms something, please keep it to yes or no questions, I will be more than happy to talk later though. It has been quite the pleasure meeting you both and I wish you the best of luck with hatching your clutch.&quot; With that all said, Kyla returned to her normal nod yes and no only communication.<br />
<br />
Heather wanting nothing more than to just leave, did her best to make up an excuse. &quot;Oh it is just a made up language from this book I read a while back about some kid with a dragon friend. It was a greeting they used in the story. I forgot the title though. Apparently, Mrs. Kyla had also read it before and was simply saying hello&quot; lied Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so, well let me know if you remembered its title&quot; requested Lexi, dropping the topic for now.</p>
