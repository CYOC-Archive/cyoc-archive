<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So how do you think it’s going in there?” Samantha asked as she gazed back towards the study. Kellie shrugged, uncertain as to how to answer. “Your Guess is as good as mine,” she sighed. “To be honest I’ve met Katie’s grandparents only a little more than Ann over the years. It’s probably intense.” The sound of two preschoolers screaming brought their attention once more to the children they were watching.<br />
<br />
“Think it’s as intense as this,” Samantha grumbled as she saw Claudia and Mika begin to fight over a toy. “Probably not,” Kellie chuckled as she gazed at her friends. Unfortunately for them, the ring had not only regressed Mika, Claudia, and Mary Elise physically but mentally as well. The two girls had reverted to their four year old personalities, a personality that consisted of the two either getting along great or ready to rip each others throats out. “Cmon you two knock it off,” Samantha grumbled as she picked the two 4 year olds up, holding them under each arm.<br />
<br />
“Claudia started it,” Mika whined. “I was playing with the ball first and she stole it.”<br />
<br />
“Did not you big liar,” Claudia shot back. “Stop telling Mantha lies bout me.” Both 4 year olds now looked pleadingly at Samantha, their bottom lips trembling. “She’s being mean,” the two girls cried befor bursting into tears. Samantha could only sigh as she placed the two girls back on the floor, giving them a tight hug and rubbing their backs. “It’s okay girls,” she said warmly. “I’m not mad at you but you shouldn’t fight with one another your friends.”<br />
<br />
The 4 year old Mika and Claudia wiped their eyes as they gazed at one another, a frown fixed on their childish faces. “I’m not friends with her,” Claudia grumbled, sticking her tongue out at Mika. “And I’m not friends with her,” Mika shot back giving Claudia a raspberry. “Fine,” Samantha sighed. “But why don’t you go play with Mary. She looks really lonely playing by herself. I bet she would love having you two play with her.”<br />
<br />
The two girls looked at the sullen 4 year old Mary Elise who was currently holding a doll. The idea of playing with their friend seemed to make the two forget about their argument. “That sounds like fun,” Mika exclaimed. “Cmon Claudia.” Mika bolted towards their friend as fast as her tiny legs would take her, Claudia telling her to wait up as she tried to follow behind.<br />
<br />
“Not bad Sammy,” Kellie smirked. “You looked like a natural with those two.” Samantha blushed, thanking Kellie as she watched their friends begin to play amongst themselves. “Thanks Kel,” she said warmly. “You know it amazes me that those two would get together after all the fighting they used to have.”<br />
<br />
“Tue,” Kellie said. “But I think it’s like a boy pulling pigtails on a girl he likes in the playground. They were both too young to really comprehend that they liked each other a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Judging how they used to fight I can see they must of REALLY liked each other.” Samantha and Kellie giggled as they looked at the rest of the party guests. While Mika, Claudia, and Mary Elise seemed to have stopped at four for now the others seemed to be still growing younger. Kellie could see that the girls were all back in high school now. Like their friends they could see that their youthful personalities were taking over as they grew younger.  <br />
<br />
Tanya was now a very curvy girl of 16 who Kellie had to admit must of been very popular with the boys in high school. The formerly heavyset woman had the body of grown woman with large d cup breasts, a very curvy figure and flat stomach. The weight she had put on her stomach and thighs had been wiped away giving the teenager the appearance of a fully mature woman in twenties, despite an innocent teenage face. Missy had done her hair up into two very cute and flirty pigtails and seemed to be trying to organize the group into a team to help babysit. The girl had an athletic build to her with perky b cup breasts and a trim waist. Amber had somehow found some dark makeup and was in the process of redoing her gothic look, slathering dark eyeshadow and lipstick onto her face, The girl had obviously gone upstairs and raided the closets of either Lisa or Gloria as she now sported a dark shirt and jeans, having discarded her baggy adult clothing. Finally Denise had withdrawn to a corner, mostly keeping to herself as the others talked with one another. Despite the girls shyness both Samantha and Kellie were in awe of the girls beauty, Dark hair framed a models face on the beautiful teenage girl. Although her clothing was now baggy on her the two college age girls could see an impressive and trim figure under her clothing.<br />
<br />
“So how young do you think everyone’s going to get,” Samantha asked as she watched the teens interact with one another. “No clue,” Kellie shrugged. “Possibly the same age as Mika, Mary and Claudia but they could end up younger. Just a guess but guessing the amulets May have saved them from getting too young.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Samantha mused. “But it’s still crazy that the amulets didn’t protect them. Usually the rings have no effect on us.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but this was three rings casting a spell,” Kellie stated. “Probably overwhelmed the protections in the amulets.”<br />
<br />
“Just happy Tricia is protecting me,” Samantha said. “Still, does look like the girls are having fun.” <br />
<br />
“Don’t,” Kellie said sternly, “Don’t Even think about it Sammy. With how whacky the kids are the last thing I want is Tricia jumping into my womb and you becoming a preschooler.”<br />
<br />
“Why would Tricia jump to you,” Samantha asked, slightly alarmed. “Lynne did that with Gloria,” Kellie said. “And since you and me are the only ones not being affected out here, chances are she would jump to me and I am not dealing with stretch marks so get that thought out of your head.” Samantha was silent for a moment, it made sense what Kellie was saying. As fun as it looked she needed to stay focus, the last thing she wanted was to find herself unoregnant and back in preschool. “Consider it forgotten,” she said, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kellie, Hey Samantha.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and Samantha turned to see Maddie Haskins and Kumiko approach. The former adults were now only 16 years old, Kumiko appeared to be a very skinny girl with a cute face while Maddie appeared a little more athletic and a slightly larger bust. Both teens now struggled to hold their clothing on their regressing bodies. “What is it girls,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Is Mrs. Turners mom going to be okay,” Maddie asked, “I mean she seemed like super pissed when she walked in here.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh Maddie just relax,” Kumiko groaned. “The party will be fine, they just have to hash out some grown up stuff, stop being such a wuss.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not being a wuss,” Maddie whined. “I’m just, worried that’s all.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and Samantha watched the two teens carefully as they talked. Kumiko seemed to had reverted back to her rebellious teenage personality while Maddie had returned to the time in her life when her self esteem was at its lowest. The pretty athletic brunette seemed to have no comeback for the high spirited Asian girl. As the two talked Kellie and Samantha watched the girls shiver before growing a year younger. As they became 15 they could see the girls curves diminish ever so slightly while their faces became even more innocent. What surprised them the most was the change in Maddie’s attitude,<br />
<br />
Maddie’s face broke into a scowl as she glanced over at Kumiko. The 15 year old appeared very stuck up now with an air of superiority. Narrowing her brow she now stepped towards the slightly shorter Kumiko.  “Who are you calling a wuss,” she snorted. “Newsflash their Kumi, the only wuss around here is you. I mean seriously, what were you thinking taking Mika here. The kids not even potty trained.”<br />
<br />
“She’s potty trained,” Kumiko called. “And like what am I supposed to do? Tell my parents I’m not taking her?”<br />
<br />
“Well if you were half the badass you claimed to be you would,” Maddie snorted. “Ugh why do people even like talking with you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh oh,” Samantha whispered as Kumiko and Maddie began to argue. “What,” Kellie asked quietly. “Ugh I remember,” Samantha sighed. “When we went out with Gloria that first time Maddie told us how she was a bit of a brat when she was this age. She got over it and became really nice later but it looks like she just went back to being that brat.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” Kellie grumbled. “So now we get to deal with a teenage cat fight.” Kellie and Samantha groaned as they watched the two teens trade insults, hopefully whatever the O’Tooles were talking about would get resolved soon.</p>
