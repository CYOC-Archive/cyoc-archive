<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wasn&#39;t asleep for two long. An hour. Maybe two. He wasn&#39;t fully asleep. Not totally. He was vaguely aware of a constant stench and a swaying back and forth. <br />
<br />
While he was mostly asleep, his donkey had wandered over to drink deeply from the trough. It only took about an hour, while the donkey had resumed its grazing, before the incontinent animal rudely awakened Jeff. The donkey wouldn&#39;t even notice every time it took a piss. It was basically done automatically. It was routine.<br />
<br />
But Jeff. Now Jeff was vaguely aware of a stench and the periodic swaying as said before. But was also in a dreamlike state. He thought he was at home in his bed underneath his covers. Suddenly, his &quot;covers&quot; seemed to be getting pulled off of him as he was pushed forward at the same time. Rousing from his dreamlike state, he thought he was in a tunnel, that very quickly got bright. Suddenly, he was thrust &quot;outside&quot; as he saw the ground rushing up at him. For a heart-stopping second, he thought he was going to land on his head and be killed or paralyzed! He instinctively tried to reach out with his arms, but something was wrong. He had no arms! But then he suddenly stopped as if he was attached to something- hooves? <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a steaming hot, disgusting, yellow liquid came gushing out of his mouth unbidden. It tasted, smelled, and looked like....piss! Coming out of the middle of his face, from what he thought of as his own mouth! He was able to somehow shift his gaze and wobble himself enough just a bit and catche a glimpse of his dark black penis-body. He also saw all four hooves of a donkey. Not all at once. He was really only able to see any two hooves at a time. And the white fur from the underside of a donkey. <br />
<br />
Seeing his own body made him want to scream. He was just a penis! The penis of....a donkey! That was when he realized what that smell he couldn&#39;t do away with was. <br />
<br />
He tried to mentally extricate himself, but he only had extremely minimal control over his own body. It wasn&#39;t even HIS body. But rather, just a body PART. A male appendage. To a donkey. And that donkey could do with it as he pleased. <br />
<br />
Finished with the piss, and without any thought at all, Jeff found himself being pulled back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait! Let me out of here!&quot; But too late. He was sucked back into his own sheath. This time Jeff didn&#39;t go to &quot;sleep.&quot; He was now too traumatized to drift off. He was also alone with his thoughts. He was gently rocked back and forth now and then, and could feel the balls as his own body. He could feel the trunk of his body as the main shaft. Especially anytime his donkey moved. This painted a a map of his own body in his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a penis. Not just a donkey, but the PENIS of a donkey! That&#39;s all I am now, and all I&#39;ll ever be. Just stuck dangling from this one spot. <br />
<br />
And so, for the rest of Jeff&#39;s days, that&#39;s exactly all he remains. A penis that that either passes (several times every single day), spews (his donkey tries to mate several time a week; but luckily for Jeff, he&#39;s rarely successful; unluckily for him, his donkey will take anything he can get), or just hangs there inside his black pouch. <br />
<br />
The only views he ever gets other than from inside his sheath, is that of the ground and legs and hooves of his owner. Once in a while, he will see the hole of a Jenny or the puckered asshole of another male jack. Neither of which has any sense of hygiene. And even if they did, donkeys can&#39;t do anything about it. It isn&#39;t like they can wipe their rearends after taking a shit. <br />
<br />
Jeff often wonders how much time has passed. What sort of time of day (or night) it is. He would always remain in the dark, both figurative and literally. His sky has become the white furry underside of his donkey. And even then, he doesn&#39;t see much of it. He&#39;s just stuck dangling upside down, looking at the ground and hooves anytime he is let out. And that&#39;s just for him to taste the vile piss for a few moments he would never get used it. If anything, Jeff becomes mentally sick by the fact that&#39;s the only think he will have any sort of taste of for the rest of his life. Well, that and donkey spunk, and once in a while the hint of donkey shit. <br />
<br />
Jeff also has anxiety whenever he sees his donkey step directly into the middle of a pile of manure on one of its random wanderings and pissings. <br />
<br />
By just the end of his first week as a donkey dick, Jeff could swear an entire year went by. He doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s been trapped like that for just a week, and no way for him to ever find out. Might be just as well he doesn&#39;t know, for if a week seems like a year to him, a year would be feel like an eternity. <br />
<br />
Back in his old room in the house he grew up and would never see again, the chronivac disappeared back to the shop of the makers. By the end of a year, the police would give up looking for Jeff, as the case goes cold. His parents would never know what happened to him. Jeff would be declared dead by the courts, and his family would hold a funeral service for him. But poor old Jeff would still be hanging from his donkey, as a dick. Forever. As he programmed his own fate to be stuck this way.</p>
