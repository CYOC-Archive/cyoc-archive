<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The past week had been frustrating for Melissa. Not only had she found out that James had a pussy, he had an animals... a mares. Big and puffy, she&#39;d gotten a full eyeful in the garden. Upset she had ran, first sulking in the living room, where she had taken residence on the couch. Then, hours later, driven by both curiosity and annoyance had seeked out James<br />
<br />
Confronting James, he had claimed he hadn&#39;t told her for fear that she&#39;d reject him for not being a man. That had made sense, and Melissa had held him, reassuring James that she didn&#39;t care. That she still loved him, and wanted to be with him. So she moved in to his room, against his protestations that his parents wouldn&#39;t condone it. As it turned out, neither Henry nor Joan batted an eyelid, Henry even querying why it had taken that long.<br />
<br />
Now together again, albeit in separate beds at first, Melissa looked forward to James returning to normal. Yet. Something was still off. <br />
<br />
James was still often distant. Distracted. Staring out into the garden, or pacing the clearing. More than once she caught him in the garden patch, eating greens straight from bed. At night she snuck into his bed from time to time, and though he accepted her presence, he never tried anything or initiated anything. Curse or not, real or not, she was as horny as a warthog, and could not understand why James would not reciprocate. It drove Melissa insane.<br />
<br />
So she found herself, one night, almost two weeks into living in the Cabin, lying in bed, a heavily breathing James beside her, and she staring at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Her eyes were darting, wide awake, staring at all the shadows of leaves, dancing on the bedroom wall, cast by the light of the full moon. She felt nervous, a nervous energy, pent up frustration, emotional and physical. It felt like she was banging her head on a wall trying to get James to respond to her, and the walls were beginning to close in. Breath rising, becoming shallower, Melissa felt her chest beginning to close in, until James snorted beside her and she bolted up. Muttering, &quot;I need to get out of here!&quot; She quietly slipped from the bed, and padded, barefoot across the floor.<br />
<br />
She felt the fluffy dog&#39;s tail behind her brush the back of her legs as she made her way to the door. Moonbeams spilled across her naked form as she slipped from the room, silent as a ghost. Even sleeping naked with him had not stirred emotion in James.<br />
<br />
She felt the rough warm timber of the stairs and hall caress her feet as she descended. A drink of water, or something stronger, was needed. Turning she made for the kitchen, still silent, still feeling the long curls of her hair tickle her back, and the soft fur of her tail rub off her thighs.<br />
<br />
Pushing the door to the kitchen open she froze. A figure stood, facing away, backlit by the light of an open fridge. It stood of a height with her, too tall to be Jess, too feminine to be Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joan?&quot; She reasoned. Slowly the figure turned, revealing the Miller matriarch. As the figure turned, Jess saw, in sidelong silhouette that Joan was, like her, completely naked. Cock, balls, crotch-tits and breasts all standing out against the light. <br />
<br />
Something about the sight of Joan, naked for the first time and breadth of changes revealed, caused a memory to stir.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot; she said loudly fumbling for the light switch, and wincing as the bulb came on, harsh and buzzing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Joan grinned, either not picking up Melissa&#39;s tone, or chosing to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Melissa pointed, at her, recognition flashing. The tits, the cock, all of it. The creature in the forest. The one that had bull-rushed her. It had been Joan.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were naked in the forset! You chased me!&quot; She accused, suddenly a little fearful.<br />
<br />
Joan laughed heartily, sending everything jiggling. Enough to make Melissa gulp. &quot;Yeah it was me. Tried to scare you away! Didn&#39;t work did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s face grew cross, the two had never really seen eye to eye. Melissa knew Joan never thought she was good enough for her darling son. &quot;Tried to scare me away from James you mean!&quot; She shot back. Joan made an amused face. &quot;Did I now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stuttered, falling over her words. &quot;Y-yeah! Y-you didn&#39;t want me with him, so you tried to chase me off. But it didn&#39;t work did it!&quot; She smiled smugly. She watched, however, as Joan&#39;s smile grew wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;But did it work girl? Are you with him?&quot; Joan dropped.<br />
<br />
Melissa blushed, but managed to respond. &quot;Fuck you! I&#39;m with with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan frowned, &quot;Language girl!&quot;. Melissa gritted her teeth, &#39;this bitch was infuriating&#39;. She didn&#39;t have a chance to respond before Joan continued. &quot;You&#39;re with my son, maybe. But is he with you?&quot; She smiled, knowingly.<br />
<br />
Melissa frowned, &#39;This bitch knows something&#39;. &quot;What do you mean by that!&quot; she growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tone girl!&quot; Joan said, condescending, enough to make Melissa&#39;s blood boil. &quot;If you know something, just say it you manky old bitch!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Joan made a &#39;tut-tut&#39; noise, and slowly put down the glass of milk she had been holding. Melissa froze. Maybe that had been too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;James.&quot; She said, placing a hand on the chair in front of her, &quot;James is just not into you girl. Not anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa pouted, hands coming to cross across her naked, tanned breasts. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t he be!? And stop calling me &#39;Girl&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan smiled, &quot;But that&#39;s exactly what you are. A girl. Just a girl...&quot;. Joan didn&#39;t want to completely out that James, not yet. Just give enough to tease and annoy this bitch. This tasty, tasty bitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a girl too...&quot; Melissa spat back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Joan said, tone heavy. &quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot; She rounded the table and began advancing on Melissa. Melissa froze, eyes wide, whites showing and mouth opening in surprise. Joan&#39;s chubby cock, had risen, now poking up between her crotch tits, one eye glaring at her. It made butterflies flutter in her stomach. A cock. At attention. Lacking any attention from James, or an outlet to recharge her phone from, Melissa hadn&#39;t seen one like this in weeks. The sight made her mouth water; her mouth and her pussy.<br />
<br />
Joan came to a stop just within Melissa&#39;s personal space. Close enough to hear, Joan whispered. &quot;James isn&#39;t into you girl. But I could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa gulped, both hands, instinctively drifting over her tits and privates to cover her naked form. She felt her tail curl between her legs. She wanted to snap back at this bitch, but she was also intimidated by her. Impressed by how confident she was, how intense her glare. &quot;C-could be?&quot; Melissa shrank back further. Suddenly feeling small.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I could be. I could have you.&quot; Joan stated assuredly. Something in Melissa made her feel properly subservient. She&#39;d challanged Joan, and in shrinking away, giving up the argument, had long since lost. The power Joan now held over her was terrifying... and exilhirating. <br />
<br />
Joan took a long sniff of the air, and moaned, making Melissa shiver. &quot;I can smell you girl. You&#39;re interested.&quot; Joan&#39;s nose had begun to flatten again, into that of a goats, she knew her muzzle would follow. But first she had this little bitch in the palm of her hand. This baby-faced, curvy, tanned, gym-rat.<br />
<br />
She could smell her, smell her frustration, smell her desire. Melissa shuddered, nipples rock hard. This felt good, being commanded around. She&#39;d die before she&#39;d admit it. But it felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I was?&quot; She said, trying to get sarcasm in, and not really putting her heart into that. Joan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d tell you to be a good girl and squat down.&quot; She said, voice like silk.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-down?&quot; Melissa stammered. Joan nodded, only once. &quot;On the ground girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause. &#39;I&#39;m not really doing this am I?&#39; Melissa thought, even as her body betrayed her and she squatted down, breasts now fully on show, hanging between her knees, pussy spread mere inches from the ground, and ass cheeks spread to the world. She felt exposed, vulnerable, but also controlled and safe by Joan&#39;s presence. Now eye level with Joan&#39;s rock hard cock, and only inches from the strongly smelling appendage, her tongue snuck out and she leaned forward, mouth open to take a lick.<br />
<br />
She recieved a sharp rap on the nose. &quot;No!&quot; Joan barked, &quot;Show me you&#39;re interested first. You get a treat when you&#39;ve done a trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was treating her like a dog. The realisation hit too late for Melissa to do anything other than whine, &quot;But I&#39;ll change!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will!&quot; Joan commanded. Melissa believed her. She believed her, because she knew she wanted to. Wanted to change and show Joan that she deserved that cock. Not making eye contact, Melissa&#39;s hands slid down her toned legs and to her bush.<br />
<br />
Unkempt and curly, she had been forced to let it grow since coming to the Cabin, razors were not something it thought to provide. A long bugbear of her own body, one that had started with puberty, was that she was actually quite hairy. Waxing, shaving, and creams normally kept the dark hair at bay. But here, in the absence of bathroom utensils, she could feel the hair growing in a happy-trail all the way up to her belly button.<br />
<br />
Hands brushing past her shame she hit her dribbling lips. Parting them a finger slipped in with silky ease. Curling it up she have a jerk, wanting to feel it deeper within her. It felt good, but not as good as she knew sex would feel. She moaned. Eyes and mouth opening to track the cock dangling near her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet girl!&quot; Joan &#39;tssked&#39; &quot;Find the change. Show me your change first!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s mouth widened in pleasure as she continued, fingers delving frantically. A prickling sensation began around her pussy, and her inner thighs, and her ass cheeks. Eventually moving up to her belly. More and more she could feel her hands brushing hair, through more and more. Softer and softer hair. She had to show her master! Make her proud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Furrr...&quot; She moaned other hand pointing. Joan leaned back to look, and smiled. &quot;Good girl!&quot; she said. Hopeful, Melissa&#39;s hand reached out to grab the penis, only to leave out a whine as Joan stepped back. Grasping Melissa lost her balance, tubling forward onto all fours. Once caught, one hand returned and began to frantically finger herself again. Now on all fours she rocked and felt her tail wagging as her hand squelched away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels good doesn&#39;t it girl!?&quot; Joan teased, watching Melissa moan a half response, affirmative. &quot;You have to finish before you get this.&quot; She said, slowly taking a cross-legged seated position in front of her. Melissa gaped at the cock, standing erect, poking up as a centre-piece of Joan&#39;s seated position. Hands snaked in, and began to slowly stroking her cock. Melissa watched in awe as Joan&#39;s mouth began to push out. Nose flat and pink, teeth widening. &quot;-Ffinish girl!&quot; Joan half-lisped through her altered mouth.<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s head dropped, and, redoubling her efforts with thoughts of sex, she brought herself to a, dripping, shuddering orgasm, whithin the minute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl!&quot; Joan smiled, it looked weird with her face now pushed out most of the way to a goats muzzle, though devoid of fur. &quot;Now do you want to stay with my son, or leave him and let him be happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa, desperate, but with an ounce of resistance left, didn&#39;t want this bitch to completely win. &quot;James is my boyfriend!&quot; She said as defiantly as she could, before sitting back, opposite Joan, to present herself to her. Waiting. Joan saw the fur that had spread over her upper legs, privates and lower belly and said. &quot;Wrong answer... No treat for you!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Melissa made a frustrated, angry whimper, then watched as Joan&#39;s head leaned forward, and down. Jaw dropping open Melissa watched as Joan&#39;s long face nuzzled between her heavy crotch-tits, and found her own cock. The pudgy cock slid into the waiting muzzle and Joan sucked sensuously. Only moments passed before a feminine grunt left her mouth and Melissa watched as her lips closed around the cock, throat making gulping motions. Eventually, when Joan surfaced for air, Melissa was still flabberghasted, having watched a goat woman suck herself off. Her pussy was dribbling like crazy.<br />
<br />
Joan took a long sniff of the air. &quot;I c-a-an smell you still&quot;. A tiny bleat squeaking out. &quot;The price for a treat is now two changes. Change twice, free my son, and my door will open!&quot; Joan said rising. Walking past she paused beside Melissa, and patted her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go-o-od girl!&quot; She said. Before clopping out of the room.</p>
