<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">you were hesitant at first while he was setting up a large cylinder, empty tank that he was leaning there beside it as he stood in front of you. Luckily, the door to the aquarium&#39;s tank area wasn&#39;t shut for someone forgot to close off the room. do you take the empty tank, or jump in to the aquarium tank and hope for the best? for better judgment though, you chose the empty tank that the old man was leaning on over to being in the aquarium&#39;s tank with the fishes in which were swimming in.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmm, maybe... i&#39;ll take the tank there then the aquarium&#39;s one. besides, how bad can this be?&quot; you said as the old man was starting to fill it up for you to be in, unaware that he was smiling from you while he was working.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you still have maybe about 30 minutes to an hour, before the other humans come along and enter the zoo exhibit. that being said, I suggest you get yourself ready to jump into this tank here and make yourself fears looking. in your case however, you do. also, if you&#39;re not the one who&#39;s heart is into it that you better get used to it.&quot; the old geezer said as he was looking nervous while he was filling up your tank that you were soon going to be in for he was also trying to hide it for he was probably trying to calm you down, but Why was he the one being so nervous on you all of the sudden?<br />
<br />
thinking as to why he was nervous around you now that if anything, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s supposed to be nervous for you were the one that was going to be in a giant fish tank with possibly no air to your LUNGS anymore. still though, there it was as you see it being poured down into the abyss the empty tank for it was WATER. you wanted it, no, you DREAD it as there was a sign near by somewhere. still though, who cares about it right now that your mean focus right now as your eyes was staring on to this delectable WATER.<br />
<br />
it took some time as you went over to the fish, but they seemed worried that it was more for you then themselves. by the time the water was about half full, he signaled you over to come that he even tries to help you up into the soon to be ready tank for you. kneeling down with his hands out in front that he was offering you up and into the tank, like a foot stool for you foot was soon ready to be lifted up by his help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... here we go! upsy-dasy!&quot; the old geezer said as he lifted you up to the railing. lifting your legs over that you felt a bit more athletic as you moved around. your legs going in side by side with your tail tucked to one side as you thought about it by sticking it between your legs, but you quickly noticed it to be uncomfortable and found it more easily to move it through the water like this that your big shark like body don&#39;t slow you down much. still though, it dose feels like you could move faster with this body you have now then without for this feels to good to pass up on anybody.<br />
<br />
however, it&#39;s Not like it matters though for it was at least normal enough for you. In fact, you got used to your new shark like features pretty quickly that Your genitals no longer feel like &quot;a lack of a penis&quot; and is more like this was a normal thing to you now. you felt your tail touching the water&#39;s surface, before the water level rose to your aquatic feet that you gently kicked up some water for the water was a bit cold though as it did felt nice and relaxing while you were slowly getting used to the water&#39;s new temperature.<br />
<br />
by holding up your arms on the railing of the tank, you lowered yourself into the tank as the water was now reaching up yo your waist area. you didn&#39;t know it then, but it was a soon the one regret that you&#39;ve made. just as you were ready to do so that you completely submerged yourself in water as it now fills it up to the rime of the tank, after you said your final words from the surface air.<br />
<br />
&quot;well... ready or not, here I come. *inhaling a deep breath*&quot; with that, you fully jumped in with a big &#39;SPLASH&#39; and completely submerging yourself in the water&#39;s tank.<br />
<br />
once submerged as your feet were touching the floor&#39;s tank now, the old sailor man quickly shuts up the led and locks it into place. leaving you trapped for he was trapping you there inside as you realized that you were just hooked up like a fish to a fisherman. slamming and banging on the glass wall that you tried to yell and scream for help on being let out, unaware the glass was sound proofing you inside.<br />
<br />
it was a small, yet tight fit for there was very little room to move around in now that the old man just chuckled and smiled as he looked at you. &quot;I see that you&#39;re wondering why I did this just now to you, aren&#39;t you my little guppy friend?&quot; he said as you felt didn&#39;t like the way he just called you guppy for guppies were small fish, and you were not small. secondly, you weren&#39;t his friend for you only just met him a few moments ago that you now don&#39;t trust him to what was going to happen next with him.<br />
<br />
you thoughts were that you&#39;ll be continuing the day, hiding between the decorations as people would flock up the zoo and watch the fish while trying to see you. After all people were gone that someone was here that were still working, being completely erect for the matter. however, those thoughts were now gone as there was something strange about this old man going on that you soon found out what it was. the only question is... what.<br />
<br />
&quot;for now though, You&#39;ll have to hide in here for when the humans come. That&#39;s all. You can do that, right? he informed you through the glass that it almost sounded like he wasn&#39;t an old man anymore. this got you into a panic as to who this person was that all you want to do now was to get out of this tank and rush back home, back to where it was safe.<br />
<br />
you keep moaning for about a minute, for that was the only thing coming though the glass as your capture spoke up again. &quot;I want you to be relaxed right now. no one here&#39;s going to hurt you. still though, Let&#39;s get you a little more comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
placing your tank somewhere to hide that by lifting you up with a small mobile lift dolly, you were able to see the sign on what it was saying about you. &#39;the incredible tigershark! is he human, a tiger, or a fish? $5 to feed him fresh fish.&#39;<br />
<br />
was this guy planing to do this on you right from the start? covering your tank up with sea colored drapes, leaves you there for a moment while taking the sign with. just then, you realize that you are now alone. Well, not technically for There were still a lot of fish in the aquarium.<br />
<br />
you didn&#39;t know how lone you were in there, but someone decided to return and sees you as you let out a little moan for this gut placed in your tank something small and electrical that send shivers all over you. followed by another small moan, And another one as you were starting to feel weird by this. seeing this while realizing what was going on, this person goes down as this makes you moan with real fear and slowly turns on what appears to be vibrating from the floor that this makes You moan uncontrollably for you didn&#39;t what this feeling was holding over you.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t control anything about you at this point, but then a really strong surge hits you that fills your entire body as this makes you feel those new body parts of yours even better. your last moan was so loud that it could be heard in the whole zoo area, probably. After ten minutes with your human-shark combination that you finish what felt like it was the best part of your life..., maybe even longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;i&#39;m glad you enjoyed that little pleasurement, cause this is really going to make you wish you&#39;d stayed home today.&quot; tugging at the neck that you soon realized this old sea dog of a sailor man, was wearing a latex mask as the hand were underneath it now. once the mask was off, to reveal one&#39;s self that you couldn&#39;t believe who it was for it was none other then...</p>
<hr/><h3>
who could it be that was wearing the old sea dog of a man disguise?</h3>
