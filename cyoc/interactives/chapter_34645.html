<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at the burger joint, Guy and Cray walk in and each order their own substantial amount of food.  Seeing that there is no table open in the crowded restaraunt, Guy said, &quot;You wanna head to the park?&quot;  &quot;Sure.&quot; Cray responds, and the two start heading towards the park a few blocks away.<br />
<br />
Along the way, Guy and Cray talk, and start to get to know each other better.  They find that they have a lot in common and quickly start to become friends.  When they arrived at the park, they found a quiet bench near the pond to eat their lunch.  Guy keeping his eye on Cray's ointment bottle at all times wondering when Cray was going to try it.<br />
&quot;So you wanna come over later for a beer at my place?&quot; Cray asked through bites of his third burger.  &quot;Sounds great!&quot; Guy responded, adding, &quot;Hey, you should try out your ointment now, and then later tonight you can tell me how its working.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good idea!&quot; Cray said, sounding enthused (much to Guy's relief).  <br />
<br />
Cray picked up the bottle from the bench, and undid the cork on top.  The familiar smell wafted into Guy's nostrils as his excitement grew.  Cray quickly downed a little over half the bottle, &quot;UGH! It's disgusting!&quot; Cray said, wiping his mouth with the back of his large forearm.  &quot;You'll get used to it!&quot; Guy said, crumpling up his garbage while standing to stretch.  His tight shirt strained over his thickly muscled torso as he raised his huge arms over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'll see you around 8 then?&quot; Cray asked, tossing his garbage into a nearby bin.<br />
&quot;Sounds awesome.&quot; Guy responded, hardly able to keep his excitement from his voice.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day, Guy couldn't think of anything else besides Cray and what kinds of changes he was to undergo that night.  Remembering that it took just about 9 hours or so for the ointment to take effect on him, he knew that at about 9 pm that night, Cray would begin his transformation.<br />
<br />
When 8 o'clock rolled around, Guy was ringing Cray's doorbell.  &quot;You sure are a punctual one, aren't you, Guy?&quot; Cray said with a smile as he opened the door.  He was wearing somewhat loose blue jeans, that only slightly showed off his developed thighs, and a dark blue pinstriped button-down shirt that hugged his large lats and chest, as well as tightened around his biceps whenever he flexed.  Underneath the blue button-down, which was only buttoned 3/4 of the way up, was a white undershirt, and Guy could just make out the outline of a white wife-beater beneath that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell you so dressed up for, dude?&quot; Guy joked as he stepped into the house.  &quot;You think this is a date or something?  'Cuz I don't swing that way, man.&quot; Guy said chuckling.<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Cray said smiling, &quot;it was just about all I had that wasn't dirty.&quot;<br />
Walking into the living room, Guy glanced around.  'Pretty nice place.' he thought.  &quot;Bud Light OK?&quot; Cray called from the kitchen.  &quot;Sounds great!&quot; Guy called back, settling down on the couch as Cray came in from the kitchen with an open Bud Light in each hand.  &quot;So how's the ointment working out for ya?&quot; Guy asked.  &quot;Great actually!&quot; Cray said as he settled on the opposite couch, &quot;it started to work almost right after we finished lunch!&quot;<br />
&quot;That's awesome, man!&quot; Guy said, taking a swig from his beer and thinking, 'just wait 'till you see just how well it works!'<br />
&quot;Wanna watch the game?&quot; Cray asked, and without waiting for a response, turned on the football game.<br />
Both watched in silence for some time, Guy stealing glances at Cray every few minutes to see if anything was happening.  It wasn't long before Cray piped up, &quot;is it getting a little warm in here or what?&quot; This was exactly what Guy was waiting for, and, trying to contain his excitement, turned to Cray and responded as calmly as possible, &quot;I didn't notice.  Why?  You think it is?&quot;  The whole time Guy was eyeing every inch of Cray searching for some kind of growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, man.  I don't know what it is.&quot; Cray said, still watching the football game on tv, &quot;but whatever, I guess I just turned up the thermostat a little higher than usual.  In his mind, though, Cray was finding it more and more difficult to ignore the fact that he was feeling warmer and warmer and his clothes were starting to feel a bit tight.  'What in the hell is going on?' Cray wondered to himself.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Guy was starting to be able to so the changes happening to Cray.  First it was his sleeves.  Earlier, the sleeves only tightened when Cray flexed, now however, they were remaining tight, even without Cray flexing.  Cray's pants too, were also starting to tighten around his growing thighs.  Guy watched as Cray pumped up a little bigger with every intake of breath.  Cray's blue button-up shirt was starting to strain all over, as his pecs and abs started to pile even more muscle onto his already well-developed core.  Soon, Guy could see Cray's white undershirt showing in the spaces between the buttons as Cray's abs pushed out further and wider.  Cray's top button strained to hold in his swelling pecs, until it very suddenly, with a audible &quot;POP!&quot; flew off his shirt and across the room, as his pecs bounced lower and continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Cray could ignore it no longer.  &quot;Dude!&quot; he said, &quot;I think I'm growing!&quot; getting to his feet, there was really no doubt about it.<br />
&quot;Holy crap, man!  I think you are!&quot; Guy said, trying his best to sound surprised while jumping to his feet.<br />
&quot;Why is this happening!?&quot; Cray asked, sounding slightly scared but also excited and curious.<br />
&quot;I dunno man, but its awesome!&quot; Guy lied, keeping his eyes on Cray and his swelling frame.  <br />
<br />
Like Guy, Cray didn't seem to be getting too much taller, but rather, just seemed to be growing wider and bulkier.<br />
&quot;Dude, I can hardly move my arms, my shirt has gotten so tight!&quot; Cray said.  And indeed, Cray's dark blue button-up was fighting a loosing battle against his quickly inflating frame.  In quick succession, the next button down popped off and flew across the room, followed quickly by the next one, and the next one, until the shirt was entirely unbuttoned, allowing more room for Cray's huge and growing body.  The arms of the shirt, like Cray said, were now so tight around his biceps that they were forcing them straight out.  The back of the shirt wasn't prevailing much either, straining at the enormous width of Cray's back and shoulders, now nearly the size of volleyballs, while being pushed slightly upwards by Cray's traps climbing quickly towards his ears, practically swallowing his neck.  <br />
<br />
By now, Cray's jeans were skin tight around his expanding thighs, and were starting to get fairly tight around his calves.  His very large bubble butt was straining the front of his jeans against his crotch, and beginning to cause him pain.  Reaching down to undo his button and zipper, the back of button-down shirt tore cleanly down the middle at the enormous strain of Cray reaching downwards.  This only quickened the growth, as Cray's core was now virtually free of the unforgiving fabric of the shirt, now with its only remains on Cray's arms.<br />
&quot;I think you just have to flex, dude.&quot; Guy said, now unable to hide his smile and excitement, while watching Cray gaze at his enormous shoulders and biceps.  Cray, taking no notice of Guy's excitement, as he was in total shock and awe of what was happening to his body.  Cray did a double biceps pose, and the remaining fabric of the button-up shirt burst off the melon-sized biceps.  <br />
<br />
Cray was still dressed in his jeans and tightening white undershirt and wife beater.  Suddenly snapping out of his stupor, Clay looked up at Guy and said, &quot;When is this going to stop?!&quot;  &quot;How should I know!?&quot; Guy replied, &quot;I'm just as confused as you are!&quot; lying again to his new friend.  Looking down again, Cray remembered the pain from the tightening of his jeans and waistband.  Reaching around his monsterous pecs, Cray, unable to see what he was doing due to the shelf of meat building on his chest fumbled with the straining button of his jeans.  Unable to get his swelling, meaty fingers around the button he looks up worriedly at Guy, &quot;you gotta help me get these jeans off, man!&quot;  &quot;They are getting soo ti...aaaauuuugh!&quot; Cray screamed and he doubled over flexing his body.  As he did so, the button snapped off and zipped across the room, allowing more room for his torso.  His abs, by this point, were still growing, but having no where else to go, were bowing outward, forming into a gargantuan muscle gut, with his humongous, meaty pecs resting on top.<br />
<br />
Cray quickly reached down, hearing the popping seams of his white undershirt as he did so, to unzip himself.  But when he tried to pull his jeans off, he found that he could not get the waistband around his quads which were now bigger than most men's waists.  The quads were pushing tightly against each other fighting for room in the strained jeans.  &quot;Dammit!&quot; Cray yelled, as he flexed his quads again, tearing the tough fabric at the outer seams.  As best as he could, Cray peeled off the remaining jeans fabric, it was just beginning to get harder to move for the enormous man.  Finally, the white undershirt couldn't take the pulling in all directions anymore, and ripped, just like the button-down, cleanly down the back.  Peeling that shirt off was difficult for Cray as it was tightly hugging around his gargantuan biceps and triceps.  Cray was now standing only in his straining boxers and wife-beater, barely able to contain him.  The legs of his boxers, unable to get around the tremendous girth of each of his thighs, had ridden up, now looking more like briefs.  He had to adjust his stance several times by now, as the gigantic quads pushed into one another.  At this point, Cray appeared several inches shorter than he actually was since he had to spread his legs so far apart in order to be able to stand.<br />
<br />
Cray's neck had all but disappeared into his traps, and his chin was nearing brushing the top of his pecs.  The straps of his wife beater cut into his beach-ball sized shoulders, and his lats were starting a tear down each side.  Cray's abs had grown so much by this time, and bowed out so much, that Cray could not even get his immense arms around them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your getting so huge, man!!&quot; Guy said, now starting to worry, since Cray was growing a lot faster than he did.<br />
&quot;I must be nearly 400 pounds by now!&quot; Cray said, amazed and gazing as best he could at himself in the large mirror above the fireplace.  &quot;It's pretty awesome, but its getting a little hard to move!&quot; Cray said, &quot;I can't even bend or turn at my waist anymore!&quot; Cray said, sounding a bit worried but still slightly amused.  Cray's wife beater was now like a second skin, showing off every crevice and mound.  It was barely able to wrap around his enormous muscle gut, sticking straight out in front of him.  &quot;This wife beater, though, it's gettin' a bit snug!&quot;  Then Cray performed a most muscular, and the wife beater shredded completely.<br />
<br />
Cray continued to grow larger, his calves now looked as if someone had inserted bowling balls beneath his skin on the back of his legs, and he was having trouble balancing now that his stance was so wide due to his quads being so outrageously huge.  His pillow-sized, rock-hard pecs perched atop his grotesquely enormous muscle gut, displaying his cobble-stone abs.  After a few more minutes, Cray's inhumanly huge biceps collided with his mammoth forearms, locking his elbows into a straight position.  His lats pushed so far outwards and grew so thickly they greatly limited his shoulder movement to virtually nothing.  Cray's traps locked his now nearly non-exsistent neck into barely being able to look left or right.  With his movements so inhibited, Cray was not able to keep his balance with his legs so spread apart and started to fall backwards, landing with a tremendous crash, destroying the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Guy watched as Cray seemed to inflate a few more inches before the growth subsided, leaving Cray a inhumanly huge 900 pound muscle man.  Luckily, Cray's stretchy boxer shorts were able to ride out the tremendous growth, and were grotesquely tight across Cray's butt and crotch, the sides were barely visible, as they had sunk into the crevice between Cray's barrel-sized quads and his heaving gargantuan muscle gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh...my...god...&quot; was all Guy could whisper staring down at his now gigantic friend.<br />
&quot;I.........feel.......so..........heavy.......&quot; Cray gasped sucking in air as his mammoth muscles contracted and relaxed with every breath.<br />
&quot;I'm willing to bet you ARE pretty heavy, Cray!&quot; Guy said, gazing at his friend.  Cray's pecs were so large and stuck so far out from his body, that even when he was lying on his back, they still came up to Guy's mid-thigh.<br />
'What have I done?' Guy thought as he circled this tremendous mountain of muscle lying on the floor that was his friend.<br />
&quot;How do you feel? Guy asked.<br />
&quot;I........feel.........awesome.....&quot; Cray breathed, starting to catch his breath, &quot;but......I...can't.. move at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yea, I don't know what to do...&quot; Guy said, still staring wide-eyed at the sheer size of Cray, &quot;I just don't know.&quot;</p>
