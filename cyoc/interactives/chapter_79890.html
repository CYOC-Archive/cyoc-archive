<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Becca drummed both fists on Jeff's door, making it rattle in its frame. &quot;Jeff?&quot; she called out. &quot;I heard what<br />
sounded like screaming. What's going on in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;Just dropped something heavy on my toe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm fine. It was just a book. I'm decent, if you want to come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a pause, Jeff watched the doorknob turn, and Becca stepped in. She hadn't done her makeup, her dishwater-<br />
blonde hair spilled loose and uncombed around her shoulders, and she was wearing a black spaghetti-strap tank<br />
and shorts. He couldn't swear to it, but he was pretty sure she wasn't wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
At fourteen, Becca wasn't done growing yet, but she very nearly had a woman's body. Jeff wasn't a perv or<br />
anything, to him she would always be the noisy kid who'd interrupted him and his friends while they were<br />
playing GI Joe; but others told him his sister was a hot piece of jailbait. And if he was honest, Jeff could<br />
admit, mentally, they were right, even if he didn't feel attracted to his own sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what book did you drop?&quot; Becca asked, scanning the room. &quot;I didn't know you could read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha,&quot; Jeff growled, sitting on the edge of his bed. &quot;Hey, take a seat,&quot; he said, waving a hand at his desk<br />
chair.<br />
<br />
Becca sat, though she peered at him through her eyebrows, like she was studying a strange insect on the wall.<br />
Though they didn't have real knock-down-drag-out fights, Becca and Jeff had never gotten closer, as brother<br />
and sister, than an uneasy truce. Jeff supposed she must wonder why he was being so nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Becca,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you know my friends think you're hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, then nodded a bit. &quot;I suppose I do,&quot; she said. &quot;That hairy kid Matt you always hang around with<br />
checks me out every time he comes over. I think he wants to knock you out and carry me upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled at that. &quot;He's never put it like that, but he told me he'd love to go out with you. Would you<br />
date him if he asked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becca squinched her face. &quot;Are you kidding? Eww! All the girls at school call him Pigpen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I told you he has his driver's license and some money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of boys his age have driver's licenses, and some even have money. Body odor is a deal-breaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any boys you'd like to date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've given it some thought, sure,&quot; Becca said, easing back in the chair and crossing her long legs. &quot;But the<br />
boys who are brave enough to ask me are cavemen, and any boy I have to ask out is too big a wuss to get me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff slid off the edge of his bed and sat cross-legged on the floor, looking up at his little sister. She had<br />
B-cups and a 29-inch waist, if he had to guess. Slim, but shapely. &quot;If I were as young and pretty as you,&quot; he<br />
said, &quot;I'd date lots. I'd date boys who asked me, and boys I had to ask, and I'd date girls too, just to say<br />
I dated as many people as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Jeff, are you asking me out? Because even apart from the brother-sister thing, you're really not my<br />
type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no no no,&quot; Jeff said, waving his hands like he was trying to chase off a mosquito. &quot;You're not my type<br />
either, Becca. I'm just wondering, you know, what it's like to be a girl, and to be beautiful, and receive all<br />
kinds of attention, just for looking how you look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becca smiled, but it was a thin smile, like she wasn't completely comfortable discussing her looks with her<br />
brother. &quot;It's not as great as you think. I mean, it's nice sometimes when a boy buys me a soda or takes a<br />
heavy load off my shoulders. But it's all the time. I mean, you can't shut it off. I see thirty-year-old men<br />
undressing me with their eyes, and checkers in grocery stores, and everybody. I'm pretty sure my English<br />
teacher, Mister Munroe, has fantasies about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it really that bad? Being pretty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not all the time. But you can't really understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't, Jeff, because you're a boy, and you always will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, see, that's where you're wrong. I've become something new, Becca, and I want... I want to understand you<br />
better. I want to understand what it's like being a girl. Specifically, I want to understand what it's like to<br />
be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff turned his gaze away, and started calculating.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I'll never understand,&quot; Becca asked. &quot;You. You're such a weirdo. You're handsome and all, but<br />
you just do weird stuff that drives girls away, like talking the way you just did. Maybe you deserve to never<br />
understand girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becca rose from the chair, but squeaked with sudden alarm. &quot;I can't move my feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I've locked your ankles and knees,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I want you to be right here. Because we're<br />
both about to understand what we never thought we would.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becca tried to respond, but could only mention a scared, girly squeal.<br />
<br />
Jeff rose and crossed to stand before his little sister. She was nearly a foot shorter than him. He put his<br />
hands on her shoulders. &quot;Becca,&quot; he said. &quot;I've just programmed it so that you and I will swap bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Programmed... programmed what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never you mind,&quot; he said. &quot;Just understand, our minds will transport outside our bodies for just a second,<br />
then transfer straight across. I'll become you, and you'll become me. I've also programmed it so that we'll<br />
have the knowledge to live each other's lives. Like, I'll know how to put on a bra, and we'll know each<br />
other's class schedules. Don't worry, I've written the programming narrowly so we won't know each other's<br />
embarrassing secrets, just how to pass in our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be you, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to be you, Becca, and I have the power to make my wants a reality. Just to avoid confusion, your<br />
boy name will be Benny, and my girl name will be Jen, but other than that, everything will be just like it was<br />
before, except you'll be the big brother, and I'll be the little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do this, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. Don't do this. I don't want to be a boy, and I don't want to live your life. I just want to be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, Benny, I've already programmed it. The only thing left is for me to give the command. I only wanted<br />
to tell you this because you are my baby sister, and I thought you deserved some warning. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Jeff. Don't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen. And it's done. Activate.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were no sci-fi special effects, no swirly lights, no thunder and lightning. Brother and sister just went<br />
blind for half a second, and when their vision returned, Jen looked up at her towering brother, Benny.<br />
<br />
Jen jumped up, clapping her hands. &quot;It worked,&quot; she said, jumping a couple more times. Then she put her hands on her chest, stilling her jiggling breasts. &quot;Wow, that feels weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then give my body back to me,&quot; Benny said, tears rolling down his cheeks. &quot;If it feels weird, if you don't<br />
like it, then let me be me, and you go back to being you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Benny. I want to try life as a girl, and my own sister is the perfect girl to be. But listen, I put a safeguard in. We'll revert back to ourselves in seven days, unless I give the emergency command to make the<br />
change permanent. Come on, you get a driver's license out of it, don't you? And Mister Munroe will stare at<br />
me, not you, for a whole week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's... there's no way to make you change your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No there isn't. Now listen, I'm going to go text Matt. His dream date just arrived.&quot;</p>
