<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – High School Blues – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
I spent the entire fourth period in Art Class mixing paint. I was bored out of my mind, it was Friday, and I was just aching to run home so I could devote a few hours to my Playstation. I was really looking forward to the weekend, and I couldn’t stand the fact that all that stood between lunch and my weekend was two periods of math class. I hated math as it is, but to have for my final two periods of the week, was just becoming unbearable to me!<br />
<br />
During lunch we all sat around the same table, my Cousin Peter was next to me. Dustin and Jace were at another table, hanging out with the Junior Class. I had just begun my sophomore year in high school, and I was fortunate enough to have Peter with me, he was in practically all my classes, which made things really interesting.<br />
<br />
None of the teachers knew they now had two kids in their class with these powers, but all the students knew it, and none of the bigger guys even dared to mess with us anymore! But it was on a day like this that I was willing to ask for Peter’s help, so I could get out of math class early. I just needed an idea for a wish…<br />
<br />
I was admiring the blue paint that was all over my right hand. You know, it was a nice, light tint of blue like aqua blue. Then I wished for the rest of my hand to turn the same tint of blue, and my skin immediately changed color. Interesting, I thought. Such a simple wish! What if I wished for one of the other kids to turn blue as well?<br />
<br />
As I looked around, I saw Margaret, the brain in my class. She thought very highly of herself as she looked down on everybody else. She was determined to rule the school on her looks and her popularity, although nobody liked her, except for the members of her fan club. A tall, skinny blond, she was an easy target for my next big magical stunt at school. She would only talk to certain students who were from rich families, and I though she would just be the perfect victim for my wish. She placed a soft, silk cloth on her seat because, heaven forbid, she would get her beautiful, expensive dress dirty if she touched it. There she was, further decorating her face with the most expensive lipstick and makeup. I hated that girl!<br />
<br />
I looked at the aqua blue paint on my hand. Alright, Ty, time for some action! I concentrated on Margaret as her soft, white skin began to transform into aqua blue! Her lips, her nails, I even wished for her hair to turn blue. She was busy eating her yoghurt, so she didn’t notice at first. Then one of the girls suddenly started laughing, as she pointed at Margaret. She looked down and noticed her blue nails! Then she saw the rest of her hand turn blue. Panic was written all over her face when her other arm turned blue as well. Finally, when her torso and legs started turning blue as well, she screamed! She got up and looked over her blue body. “Oh my GOD!! What’s happening to me??” she yelled. Several of the girls started to laugh at her. “AAAAARCKKK!! I’m all blue!!” she screamed in horror, as she got up and ran towards the nurse’s office! Yes, I knew what I was going to wish for next. Playstation, here I come! <br />
<br />
I walked into math class and started singing Blue Dabadee… “Yo listen up here’s the story of a little guy who lives in a blue world… And all day and all night everything he sees is just blue, like him, inside and outside… Blue his house with the blue little window and the blue corvette, and everything is blue for him and himself, and everybody around, cause he ain’t got nobody to listen…”  (The song is by Eiffel65). <br />
<br />
Peter was sitting in the middle of the classroom and he was furiously taking notes. It seemed like he was writing down every thing the teacher said. Being the computer whiz that he was, he loved math class, and it didn’t bother him at all that he had math as the last class on Friday afternoon.<br />
<br />
But I hated math and I wanted to get out of that class so bad that I felt like I couldn’t stand it any longer. It was time to have some fun! “Hey Peter, come sit next to me, in the blank chair” I concentrated. Peter was still taking notes as he suddenly stopped and looked up. He turned around and saw me sitting in the back row, and I nodded my head, signaling him to sit in the empty desk besides me. Good, he got the message.<br />
<br />
He quietly grabbed his backpack and his books and sat in the desk next to me. Then he turned towards me as he was about to say something when the teacher interrupted him. <br />
<br />
“Ahem… Mister Karlowski… Did you ask to change seats in the middle of my lecture?” the teacher asked him. Darn, I was afraid I had gotten him in trouble. I was hoping that Peter would think of something, fast.<br />
<br />
“No Sir” Peter replied politely. “May I sit next to Tyler, Sir?” he asked the teacher. I could tell that the teacher was not very happy with the idea of the two of us sitting next to each other in class and I thought for sure he was going to say no. But then I sensed a strong surge of power going through the classroom. And that power wasn’t mine. I looked over and I noticed how Peter was staring at the teacher with his big, blue eyes. I swear Peter could almost hypnotize you without even trying! I knew he was reading my mind, and everyone else’s, all the time. He had gotten so used to doing it, he would just tune in to everyone’s thoughts without even thinking. <br />
<br />
The teacher just nodded, as the strange power had broken his will and forced him to accept the teen’s request. Peter finally turned towards me.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” he asked, as I turned towards him, showing him my aqua blue colored arm. “Oh no… Don’t tell me you want to turn everyone blue?” he said. Of course, I showed him my evil grin. He knew what I wanted, he read my mind. He rolled his eyes as he thought about it, and then he grabbed my right hand with his left hand. “I can’t believe you want me to help you pull this off…” he complained. “Oh hush! Will you chill out a little? Forget math class! Let’s go home and play some games on the PS2!” I replied. As he began to relay some of his powers to me, I silently wished for everyone in the school to have aqua blue skin and for all the walls in the building to turn the same tint of blue as well. This would only last for one hour, after which everything and everyone would return to its original color. Of course, I allowed myself and Peter to turn blue as well, so we wouldn’t stand out. Such a simple wish, such amazing consequences!<br />
<br />
The four walls of the classroom slowly turned from tan to aqua blue! The students just looked around, wondering what was going on. I just grinned, as I turned towards Peter, who acted like he had no idea what was going on. He didn’t say a word! I didn’t have to say anything to him either, he knew at all times what I was thinking. He was just looking around at the other students, whose skin slowly began to turn blue.<br />
<br />
When I noticed my own arms and hands turn blue, I looked around. The girls panicked as their skin became blue! Almost every single one of them began to scream! Two or three of them became hysterical, as they got up and realized that they were turning blue, from the top of their head to the bottom of their feet! I looked over at Peter! His brown hair was blue, and so were his face, his arms, and his legs. I thought it matched his ice blue eyes perfectly! <br />
<br />
There was wide spread panic everywhere, as we could hear other people screaming in the classrooms next door! Half the girls had left, all the guys were just looking at each other in confusion! Nobody knew what was going on! I thought it was awesome! Just look at all the chaos, just after one, simple little wish!<br />
<br />
People ran out of the school, running home or to some medical place nearby, for many thought this was an outbreak of some weird virus or something! It took just a few minutes or I could hear the sirens of police cars approaching the aqua blue school buildings! Next thing you knew, the fire alarm went off! That was it, class was over! I grabbed my books and tossed everything in the backpack. Peter was doing the same, as we slowly walked towards the hallway and out the building, acting like we had no clue to what was going on! It was great!<br />
<br />
Fire trucks and ambulances came; the entire parking lot was blocked off! Medical teams came to see if there had been some outbreak of a virus. Of course, they didn’t find anything! People were screaming and crying everywhere, as students tried to leave the school grounds. Everyone got out of the building, but nobody was allowed to go home yet! Well, I figured they would let us go soon, because there was nothing wrong with any of us. Doctors tried to explain why students were walking around with blue skin, but nobody knew! And the entire school had turned blue as well! It was great! This was like the joke of the century! <br />
<br />
Soon enough, the police let people go home. They couldn’t find any trace of illness or anything, so they had to let us go. I walked up to Peter, who didn’t say a word. I wanted to say something, but he read my mind and he told me to just keep quiet so that nobody would suspect us. Even if anyone would find out that we were the ones who did this, there was no way to prove it!<br />
<br />
As we started to walk home, Peter looked at his watch and noticed that an hour had almost passed since the wish was made. The important thing was that we got to go home early, and that’s all I wanted. When I walked into the door, my skin turned back to white again. I was happy, for my Playstation 2 was sitting there, waiting for me! I got what I wanted, and we all got to be blue for an hour!</p>
