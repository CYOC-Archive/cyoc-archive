<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We&#39;re almost done, gentlemen.&quot; Mr Turin told at the almost naked men around him. &quot;I&#39;m proud of the men you&#39;ve become and I&#39;m sure you will make your parents proud too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that proud will be the word I&#39;ll use.&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freaked out.&quot; Darius said and a few guys nodded. &quot;I&#39;m sure my mother is expecting to see her beloved handsome boy, not a disturbing lookalike of her husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s fun.&quot; You interfered. &quot;We could spend the summer doing adult stuff. Going to local bars, smoking cigarettes, stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no no.&quot; Mr Turin said. &quot;You are not allowed to do any of that. Maybe you look like adults but you&#39;re still underages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Underages? With these beer bellies full of hair?&quot; Shane grinned as he slapped his belly and his brother&#39;s.<br />
<br />
After that, all the newly grown men started to argue with Mr. Turin. That&#39;s when Michael, a 7th grade boy, tried to sneak out. You noticed and shout. &quot;Are you trying to escape, Michael?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, everybody turned their sight to the afroamerican boy who immediately tried to run away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! You won&#39;t escape!!&quot; Carlos run after him and chased him a few seconds before he tackle him down. His new physique gave him a huge advantage to immobilize the boy. The other men followed them and helped to immobilize Michael. Maybe, they&#39;re too many for just one kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go!! Fatsoes!!&quot; Michael struggled to get free but it was useless. Carlos, Kim, Rick, Shane, Darius and you were easily keeping him on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fatsoes? Ha! That&#39;s all that you got?&quot; Darius grinned. &quot;You&#39;re next. Maybe you&#39;ll end up fatter than us. You know what? Let&#39;s strip him! He won&#39;t fit in his kid clothes after this, anyhow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!! Wait!! Nooo!! NOOO!!!&quot; Michael was yelling and fighting to get free but he can&#39;t do anything against this group of men. Carlos started to take his shirt off, then Kim and Rick did the same with his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
Michael started to cry when Darius suddenly pulled down his shorts and boxers, exposing his small black penis to everyone&#39;s sight. It wasn&#39;t longer than 2&quot; and thin like a pencil. Also, there wasn&#39;t any sign of pubic hair around it or the undropped balls behind. In fact, there wasn&#39;t any visible hair on his body, except for his eyebrows and the afro on his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s enough guys.&quot; Frank said. &quot;Leave him alone!&quot; However, before anyone could make a move, mr. Turin didn&#39;t hesitate and shot the DILFnator at the naked crying boy.<br />
<br />
Michael began to toss and turn in pain. Something unnecessary because you all know that it wasn&#39;t a painful experience. It feels weird, yes, but not painful. His stomach started growling and suddenly he began to piss himself. It was disgusting but we kept holding him down. Was he doing this on purpose?<br />
<br />
Without stop pissing himself, his stomach started to make weird sounds again. &quot;Oh man!&quot; Kim said. &quot;What’s wrong with him?&quot; Just then, Michael started to fart, nasty and loudly. A stinky fart went directly to Kim&#39;s face. &quot;Blagh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Michael whole body began to stretch and grow longer all of sudden. &quot;It&#39;s happening!&quot; Shane shouted while you watched the boy suddenly transforming into a man. He was almost two times taller than before now! His back and limbs were sliding through the ground, forcing you to move along if you want to keep him immobilized.<br />
<br />
Before Rick could get the chance to hold Michael&#39;s legs, the growing boy suddenly kicked him off. &quot;Aagh!&quot; Rick shouted in pain as he tried to control Michael&#39;s free legs. You noticed that it had started to gain to mass and his feet now resembled the ones of a man. One by one you watched his toes and soles elongating and reshaping until he was at least size 16. The growth continued up his legs as his calves and thighs grew larger and meatier, it was becoming difficult Rick and Kim to keep them under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t let them go!&quot; Darius shouted. &quot;You are men! Don&#39;t you? You can do this!&quot; However he was struggling now with Michael&#39;s growing arms which were already starting to grow thick with muscles. He wasn&#39;t even flexing but his growing biceps were still visible like bowling balls. His back and shoulders grew so thick that Shane made a lame Hulk joke about it.<br />
<br />
You looked down at his torso and saw that his body began to form a thick chest and lean abs to match his strong arms. His face began to transform into one resembling a 35 years old version of his 13 years old self. Is his father a professional bodybuilder or something like that?<br />
<br />
&quot;You can leave him.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;He won&#39;t go anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
You obeyed and let him free. He awkwardly stood up like Bambi and, just like mr. Turin said, he didn&#39;t run away. Instead, he took his large hands and felt his new face. It was so firm and masculine. While he explored his older face, he didn&#39;t realize about the growth that was starting to happen on his behind.<br />
<br />
You all watched his buttocks began to swell from behind him as they grew larger and larger. Michael realized of it when they were so big that they&#39;ve become heavy. He cupped his now thick butt with his hands and was shocked by how big it was now. &quot;Holy shit!!&quot; He shouted because he couldn’t believe it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s the fatso now?!&quot; Darius laughed as he watched the bigger ass on the team, even bigger than his.<br />
<br />
Next, Michael started to feel something really weird. It was making him giggle quietly and then he realized that his balls were starting to swell so big that they suddenly dropped in consequence. &quot;Uuuuuh!&quot; Michael felt as his dick grew longer as it began to sway back and forth like a living being. His thick balls now hung low in a very loose hairy scrotum between his thighs and we couldn&#39;t believe that his soft dick became way more longer than it. This guy is definitely hung like a horse!<br />
<br />
Michael let out a pleasureful sigh and started to stroke his thick cock as it gets hard. &quot;Oh god! This is so embarrassing but I can&#39;t stop myself!!&quot; He was totally ashamed of what he was doing and tried to hide his huge endowment from everyone else. &quot;Uhh, please, don&#39;t look at me! I&#39;m trying to control it but it&#39;s too strong!” Michael couldn’t stop stroking. &quot;Help me! I’m too big now!&quot; He felt a pressure starting to build inside of him. &quot;Uuuuuuh!! Oooh!!&quot; Like a firehose, his dick released a thick white substance all over him and the near ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck!&quot; He said deeply embarrassed. Mr. Turin just smiled and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay Michael, you just had a big growth spurt. It’s normal.&quot; A few other men became a little jealous of the hung guy in front of them.</p>
