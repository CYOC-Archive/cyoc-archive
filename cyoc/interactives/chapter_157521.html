<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was tired of being dogged. High school and puberty are hard enough without being in an emotionally abusive household.<br />
<br />
Ty had grumbled many of these wishes before in various forms, wishing Mark would clean up after his own messy self, or wishing June wouldn&#39;t take her work drama out on him... but now it would stick...<br />
<br />
Ty thought long and hard about how to fix his life and waffled back and forth between being very cruel by forcing them into a depraved and hellish existence and just sending everyone away. Ultimately Ty realized that being outright monstrous isn&#39;t the type of... whatever he is, that he wants to be. <br />
<br />
So with that in mind he devised what he considered a humane punishment system that will allow for personal growth all around.<br />
<br />
Ty spent a day or two gathering information. He had wished for a gauge to show who the person was thinking about and a simple scale, 1-10 of how much love was felt for that person. He came to think of these as Love units. Dustin was loved between 8 and 10 depending on the minute and mood. Mark and June loved each other between 5 and 9, Dustin loved his parents between 4 and 10, and Ty himself was loved between 2 and 6, oddly enough, Dustin loved him the most 2-6, June next 3-5, and Mark steadily regarded him as a 3 though he did somehow blip up to 5 once for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
For Mark and June... Not making them alternate roles as cat and mouse was difficult but someone said that, &quot;Doing the right thing even when you can get away with the wrong thing is the true test of character&quot;, or something like that...<br />
<br />
Ty decided they would each cut their hours in half working until noon or so, then they would begin chores together, shopping, meal prep, maintenance, but when Ty or Dustin come home, they would find a cozy corner of the house to become indestructible mannequins. Their minds will be dreaming of them being on a family vacation together, but to them, it is real even after waking up. Once Ty and Dustin go to bed, they will wake up and continue with chores until the next morning when Ty and Dustin awake. After Ty and Dustin leave they will return. This will usually give them between 3 and 10 to &#39;sleep&#39; and an extra hour between 6 and 7 which Ty ensured would be extremely restful and rejuvenating.<br />
<br />
Ty hopes this will give them good memories of happy times as a family, and if their love for Ty grows in happy times without worries of bills or money, Ty will release them for a trial run... otherwise they can be slaves until he moves out.<br />
<br />
Dustin, being the most loving but crappy at showing it, earned the right to stay human 100% of the time. After all, Dustin&#39;s upbringing was mostly June and Marks corruption, but Dustin still had his own part to play. So Ty decided on letting him be the man of the house... after all, he had been trying to be an alpha male and assert his dominance for as long as Ty could remember. Additionally Mark and June did leave a hole to be filled.<br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t want to call Dustin dad or pretend he was some direct family member. Instead the punishment for Dustin would be that during the day he would become Ty&#39;s 21 - 36 year old guardian and work the day as a garbage man, or factory worker, or stock person at a local grocery store, or farm hand... Every day would be different, every job would only require some high school, and trom the time Dustin begins changing he would regard Ty as his responsibility to take care of.<br />
<br />
Guardian Dustin will love Ty and interact with him nicely. Dustin&#39;s personality as Guardian won&#39;t come into play in Dustin&#39;s judgement.<br />
<br />
Dustin will age to adulthood every morning between 6am and 8am when his shift with whatever company or business starts. He will remember how to get to his job, what to do, how to do it, and will even take on traits to fit in with the people he works with.... which will push out his knowledge of being a kid. The higher his average love for Ty is, the later this process starts and slower it is. Dustin will drop Ty off at school around 7:15 and then go to his job for the rest of the day. Ty is hoping the dynamic shift would help Dustin open up to him, as well as give him a new perspective on adulthood. <br />
<br />
When he comes home he will regress back to his normal age remembering that he is just a kid, and will be able to process the work he did and all the different jobs. Dustin will get paid for his work and treated as though he were a full time employee since 18. Taxes, medical, retirement, and so on will be taken out and put aside like anyone else.<br />
<br />
Dustin would have several ways out, the first would be to allow himself to love Ty on average at 7 love units and not below 5, Ty wants a big brother and is reaching out to him. The second would be to hold onto the fact that he was really a kid, and report to class. The speed of the mental changes each morning depend on the connection he feels with Ty. The third would be to admit that his attitude had been all wrong and that being a domineering asshole won&#39;t get him anywhere good. Ty is basically looking for significant personal or intra-personal growth.<br />
<br />
Ty really wanted them all to succeed without him forcing them to feel love for them. Putting it all together, Mark, June, and Dustin&#39;s pay will all go to Dustin&#39;s account and should keep the house running. The house, its bills, the cars, any other assets and Ty will go into Dustin&#39;s name or otherwise fall under his responsibility until Mark and June are free. Dustin he will have to take care of budgeting and choices as the &quot;Man&quot; of the house, even after work, but most of the chores will fall on Mark and June.<br />
<br />
Ty believed they could do it but....<br />
<br />
If Dustin simply resorts to being resentful of Ty and remains below 4 love units for several days, he will revert less physically each subsequent day. Eventually he will remain Ty&#39;s Guardian physically and the next day he won&#39;t mentally revert to his old self until Ty releases him.</p>
