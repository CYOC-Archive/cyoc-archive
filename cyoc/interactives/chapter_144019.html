<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still unaware of how much he had changed, Dennis morosely followed after Rachel. Lost in thought, his need to find a way to get away mixed with a hope that nobody would recognise him, he missed it when Rachel dumped the clothes he&#39;d been wearing into the lost and found as they passed it. Afterward, as they left the school building, she began talking excitedly about what a great time they were going to have and all the things they could do together until the meeting. Nodding, Dennis muttered, &quot;Sure. Whatever,&quot; and looking away, he heaved a sigh and wondered why he had to come up with such a stupid idea and why he had to make the bet with his sister.<br />
<br />
Not really paying attention to Rachel as she continued on, Dennis was caught off guard when he saw Billy waiting by the bike wracks. Suddenly remembering he was to meet his friend, he shifted what he thought was his school bag and mentally kicked himself. Grousing about how he&#39;d been caught up in his thoughts, forgetting what he was wearing, he headed over the bikes, calling out, &quot;Billy,&quot; as he did so.<br />
<br />
As he came within a couple steps of his friend, he was surprised when Billy glanced at him with a look of confusion. Raising his hand in a wave, Dennis nervously fiddled with the zipper on what he thought was his jacket as he began hurriedly explaining, &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting. But, I kind of got caught in something,&quot; missing completely how much he sounded like a girl, the fact that his friend was at least a half a foot taller and that Billy was staring at him like he&#39;d never seen him before.<br />
<br />
And then it hit him as Rachel called out, &quot;C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s go,&quot; whilst Billy stated, &quot;Hey. I don&#39;t know who you think I am. But I don&#39;t hang around with girls. Especially girls who are not in the same grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flummoxed, Dennis stared at his best friend, watching as he undid his bike lock. After a moment, Dennis squeaked out, &quot;Dude. That isn&#39;t funny. Come on, man. You know me,&quot; and absently raising a hand to adjust the baseball cap Rachel had put on his head, it suddenly came back to him what he was wearing, that his friend was somehow taller than him and that Rachel was glaring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen. You clearly have me mixed up someone else,&quot; Billy told him and throwing his leg over his bike, he added, &quot;I how you and your friend find whoever you&#39;re looking for. Later,&quot; and starting to pedal, Dennis watched as his best friend rode away.<br />
<br />
A crushed sensation settling over him, Dennis stared for a moment longer before turning and plodding back to where Rachel was waiting. A cross look on her face, he barely heard her as she snapped, &quot;Well. You know, I ought to just tell people about your sick little hobby of dressing in girl&#39;s clothes. I don&#39;t think you ever had any plan to do what I said. Just sneak away with you friend as soon as you could and leave me looking like the dweeb you calling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Dennis muttered as he felt like he was going to cry. Thinking about how bad everything was going for him, he listened as Rachel ranted on for a bit longer before offering, &quot;Whatever you want to do, it&#39;s fine by me. You want to tell people about what I am wearing. Fine. I deserve it. You want me to do what you want, to hang out with you, go to your girl scout meeting, do whatever you were planning, fine,&quot; in a quiet, humble tone.<br />
<br />
The instant she heard this, Rachel smiled as a sense of vindictiveness settled over her. Thinking all the way she could have get back at Dennis for all that he&#39;d done, she stopped the moment she got a good look at the look on his face and what she heard in his tone. Reeling, she nearly took a step back as she thought, &quot;How would react in his situation? A girl he made fun makes him dress like a girl so she can bring him to a place he doesn&#39;t want to me. Plus, his friend acts like he doesn&#39;t know him,&quot; and feeling like her world was tilting, she suddenly realised that the girls she called her friends weren&#39;t really her friends. That, except for girl scouts, they had nothing in common and never, ever hung out.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed, the sensation of a need to exact revenge leaving her, Rachel suddenly had her doubts. Looking at Dennis, thinking that in the clothes he was wearing, he really did look like a girl, she sighed heavily and said, &quot;You don&#39;t have. If you want, go get your clothes. I was only doing it because I was mad at you. Well, mad at myself more than you. That, and, because I wanted a stupid badge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis, unsure if he heard right, looked up at Rachel. Thinking it might be a trick, he waited for her to maybe laugh or tell him how she had him going. Seeing the serious look on her face, he almost took her up on her offer. But then he thought about Billy and the way he acted. Mulling this over, seeing that he didn&#39;t really have anything to do until Monday, as he was sure his best friend still would still act like a jerk if Dennis showed up at his house, he eventually said, &quot;I might as well join you,&quot; and seeing the look on the girl&#39;s face, he shrugged and added, &quot;I mean why not. You got me all dressed up like a girl. Plus, my friend ditched me and I really do feel like going home. So, maybe I should help you get your badge,&quot; and shrugging again, he waited.<br />
<br />
Elated, Rachel wanted hug Dennis. Instead, she composed herself, nodded, smiled, then, unable to stop herself, hugged him. Thinking as she did that he even smelled and felt like a girl, she tried to put it out of her mind as she squealed, &quot;Oh, thank you thank you thank you. This means so much. Tell you. I&#39;ll try and make it up to you, if you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without giving it too much though, Dennis returned the hug, thinking and feeling like it was the most natural thing to do, even though he was normally not the person to hug others and only allowed his mom to do every so often. As he did, he explained, &quot;It&#39;s cool. You don&#39;t have to do anything. Consider as an apology for making fun of you. And your glasses. And every other mean thing I did to you in the past. So, we good?&quot; to which Rachel released him and nodded.<br />
<br />
The two not doing anything for the moment, Rachel eventually made a motion and they started walking. At first, they walking in silence, but then Dennis broke the silence by asked, &quot;So. What should we do until your meeting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel thinking it over, began making suggestions. Not missing a beat, Dennis took the ideas and added his thoughts on them, or made his own suggestions. When they reached Rachel house, their afternoon planned somewhat, Rachel said, &quot;I really should tell my mom that I made a friend, who has agreed to come to my girl scouts meeting tonight. Is it all right if I tell her your name is Denise. I don&#39;t think she get it if I told her you name was Dennis and you&#39;re really a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having not expected this, Dennis found himself terrified of being found out. But thinking on how Billy reacted, he wondered if others would see him as a girl and accept him as one. Shrugging, he replied, &quot;Okay,&quot; and following Rachel inside, he asked, &quot;Mind if I use the bathroom?&quot; to which she pointed him to the first floor bathroom.<br />
<br />
The need to pee having slowly come over him as they had walked to Rachel, Dennis nodded and headed toward where she said it was. Locating it, he knocked and when no one answered, he let himself in. Locking the door, he turned to the toilet and walking over, he undid the front of the skinny black jeans, pushed down on them and the underwear, spread his legs a little bit and reached for his penis as he reached down with his other hand and lifted up the lid and seat.<br />
<br />
Only, to his bewilderment, there was nothing to grab. Glancing down at the spot where is boy parts were supposed to be, he uttered a high nervous laughter. Muttered, &quot;Nah. That&#39;s not right,&quot; he started to feel a titbit hysterical as he pushed his pants and underwear down around his ankles and spread his legs as far as he could. Still seeing nothing, he again let out another uneasy laugh and running his hand over the smooth flat skin, he slowly put his hands between his legs.<br />
<br />
Upon touching and feeling what was there, he snatched his hand back. Mumbling, &quot;No, no, no, no, no, what did she do to me, no, no, no, no, dang it, Jenny, no no, no, no, what did you do to me,&quot; over and over as he waddled across the bathroom and toward a fully-body mirror hung on the back of the bathroom door.</p>
