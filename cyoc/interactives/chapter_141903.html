<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to FMA for some name ideas ;)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let God lead you down the straight and narrow.”<br />
<br />
Lennard, out of compulsion, placed his palm on the possible homosexual as he transmitted that line. Like a conductor, the curse sent a surging electric shock to the man’s hand. Almost like water and electricity mixing with a-<br />
<br />
“ARK!”<br />
<br />
Wincing slightly due to the sudden shock of static, almost like a confirmation about what he felt about the Man’s sexuality but is not too sure...regardless, he believed his signature line would cast all the worries. Although...that shock was concerning...<br />
<br />
Little did he know...it was a set up for the homosexual to get a clear view of the man’s physique.<br />
<br />
“Are...you okay?”<br />
<br />
Dante turned around, as he saw an extremely handsome sight of the male youth minister...as for how he knew of the man’s profession besides the ‘words of encouragement’ addressed to him...the internet?<br />
<br />
Dressed in a typical casual formal style, clutching his masculinely tanned palms-most notably the ring which he held ever so greatly like an assurance that he was still in control. His Rolex shone greater in his blessings, ‘Dani-bunch was such a sweetheart, and Wayne was so great to let her buy it for a huge discount for our anniversary’ <br />
<br />
At least that was the reality they lived in now.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the youth minister was overall unfazed, he still had a perfect posture while having his decent sized biceps and pectorals on display as they pressed firmly on his buttoned down checkered shirt. Much taller than the Italian male as the Asian American forced a smile, pearly whites on display as they were cupped by a squared chiseled jaw.<br />
<br />
Incredibly manly, but the Adam’s apple did scream boyish charm instead to show that he was not a douchebag. His eyebrows raised as he squinted his eyes, partially due to his natural boy next door good looks and mostly because he powered down-like the zap took a lot from him...he had to get recharged by his girlfriend-stat! Ironically similar to how teenagers nowadays always need their power banks to charge their phones.<br />
<br />
His undercut was so neatly trimmed, and his eyebrows and tanned-leaned physique...he looked like the perfect boyfriend for him...<br />
<br />
“Im fine...”  Almost saying it in a slightly... judgemental... and harsh manner, barely concealing his words as he attempted to politely walk off-well more like brisk walk<br />
<br />
Lennard brisk walked out of the restroom, wiping his static induced hand on the side of his checkered shirt, Dante could get a clear view of that tall Asian American back, a strong firmness with that gorgeous bubble butt...he really wanted to grope it...but for some reason, he figured it was for his special one only.<br />
<br />
Wiping the gay germs onto his shirt-instantaneously eradicated by the straightness of his proper attire...with something emerging on the places he wiped on as the man paused once more before making his final speech.<br />
<br />
“Just...remember my words.”<br />
<br />
SLAM!<br />
<br />
The Youth minister leader honestly felt uncomfortable being in the restroom, maybe the man really was a gay after all! He hoped as he made his way back to his Dani-bunch, it left an impact on said male.<br />
——————<br />
“God...he was cute.”<br />
<br />
Making a statement that could be interpreted many ways, his boner rose up, and his fate was obviously sealed with a-<br />
<br />
“ARK!”<br />
<br />
The curse immediately sent the surge of heterosexual energy to his thoughts, clutching it as the voltage was too strong, going back and forth as he clumsily-<br />
<br />
BANG-THUNK!<br />
<br />
Pushed open one of the stalls as he fell backwards like a klutz, partly comically-like an innocent ditz next door, mostly because it was a set-up, as his back stretched against the now smaller fabric of his shirt, as his growing feet somehow managed to kick and lock the door due to the now tightness of his shoes.<br />
<br />
His buttocks resting on the floor, bony ass now cushioned by something...more muscular. Shocking the male that he did not get hurt...as the zap faded a way, he performed a gesture that was unusual to him.<br />
<br />
“Man...that was a close one haha...”<br />
<br />
Adopting those boyish charms into status, his stress melted away alongside any concerns for his former fang as he naively placed his left palm over on his head while resting the right on his thigh, grinning widely as he closed his eyes and felt at ease about the situation.<br />
<br />
“Uhh...what situation?”<br />
<br />
He opened them again, getting up and sitting onto the white throne as he tried to ponder what he needed to worry about....before an old Dante habit kicked in-reaching down, ready for a tugging session before-<br />
<br />
ZAP! <br />
<br />
“ARK!” He yelped, as the jolt of electricity prepared to run changes to his height and muscles to a new degree. The surge momentarily causing him to clutch once more-ceasing that habit as Lennard’s reminder coursed through his brain.<br />
<br />
‘Let God lead you down the straight and narrow.’<br />
<br />
The moment he let go of thick manhood, it doubled in size, testosterone flushing to his face as it controlled his entire bod. Of course-slightly shrinking in girth as he developed a lighter tan yellowness of his new heritage.<br />
<br />
His buttocks clenched at that remark, the straight and narrow was the best way to go-especially for a guy like him. No way can it be pierced by anything! As it bubbled up firmly, skin forgetting any ‘unnatural harassment’ as he could recall something more fitting pressing against it for a growing man like himself.<br />
<br />
His thighs definitely rocked hard, as his arousal drooped-his balls continued to pump incredible hormones everywhere else. As vast incredible energy hunkered through those thickening thighs which had to bend similar to a squat due to how far they are stretching in that tight small space. His shorts seemed more like boxers, as his calves became leaner than ever-recalling some shoot outs in soccer...and some dunks in...basketball?<br />
<br />
With those new realities, his feet grew greater and more proportionate to his new self...BURSTING even through the old dress shoes miraculously as it gave a slight panic to the manlifying male, before another thought shot through his mind with a-<br />
<br />
“Let God handle it man...!”<br />
<br />
With that, a big doofy grin, contrary to his growing intelligence and wisdom, appeared as he welcome the correction and changes to him. Appreciating his larger, more oriental feet as he knew that his undersized shoes are not only going to be fixed, but make it better.<br />
<br />
And by better-he subconsciously meant hetter. <br />
<br />
Lifting up his shirt, noting the oliveness swallowed up by a yellow hue as popcorm kernels pop up like gatherings in the movie theatre, he was such a jock man! <br />
<br />
“Damn Im pretty hot...hot....” <br />
<br />
His left hand attempted to reach once more for a tugging session of that new, young adult-hormonal teen’s member while his right was now placed over his hand and ruffling his own hair like how he would do to others simultaneously in his group. <br />
<br />
A switch from left to right, dominance in the RIGHTeous ways as the remaining ‘leftist’ within tried to reach down in slow-mo. Not even realizing the growing back which skyrocketed his height past 6ft as the gayness within him was hard to control those broader and much more muscular wings, slabs of meat echoing behind and front with a huge-<br />
<br />
BOING!<br />
<br />
His own pectorals pressed outward, causing his leftist fingers to observe it-GRAB it reverently. Partially out of confusion but now mostly out of admiration as a job well done as his gentle brown fingers elongate past his erect nipples, recalling brief moments holding hands with slender manicured fingers as they tightened, slightly roughed into man’s hands with neatly trimmed finger nails who screamed away from unnatural filth. Completely forgetting what the ‘liberal’ within him tried to do as the growing yet youthful ‘conservative’ kicked in.<br />
<br />
‘Why Jack off when you could jock in bro! What even is jacking off anyway? You should just focus on the straight and narrow.’<br />
<br />
Agreeing with that Big Bro like remark, all those memories of jacking off-lonely nights and shyness get replaced by work outs in the gym with his youth group, and youth minister bible studies with his bros and babes.<br />
<br />
His arms instinctively flexed themselves at the <br />
replaced by the gorgeous ladies who would oogle when he comes out shirtless after a deep swim and workout session. Grinning as a vision of him and his youth group, most notably Ryan, Lucas and Joel, flexing Swole and bare chested with their arms and shoulders for all to see.<br />
<br />
The old Dante was continuously buried under that display of boyish manliness, his arousal depleting by the minute, former gay urges abstaining from touchin’ men. Forgetting about his needs, a more selfless...brotherly aura took hold as his member erected was hung. An intense desire to work out and look good as his reflexed back surged an electrical charge, ripplin’ muscles, seeing eye to eye with his bros as the gym door pushed open.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!!!”<br />
<br />
A large number of ladies began grouping in, each a large number grabbing and holding their firm masculine bodies as one by one their members rose to full mast. The obviously hetero Joel Chang worked his charm instantaneously, followed by the twin like bros Aaron and Lucas, and then by-<br />
<br />
“Hot for the ladies! Aw yeah!”<br />
<br />
His het self loved the natural attention from these babes...but his remaining gay self tried to warn him something was wrong, something was missing and this was not right! The Asian male looked around...trying to source what was missing before a pair of manicured nails clung onto his strong back as the rest of the chicks went away, he turned his around slowly-<br />
<br />
RIIIIIIIIIIIIING!<br />
<br />
“WHOA!”<br />
<br />
Startled-tossing his phone onto the air as his clumsy yet meticulous fingers comedically reached and GRIP! It just in time as it continued to vibrate-an unknown call...yet for some reason, this hom-homely guy had to answer it, out of politeness due to his upbringing and heritage as he pressed the home button-<br />
<br />
FINGERPRINT NOT RECOGNIZED<br />
<br />
“Aw come on...why won’t this thing work!”<br />
<br />
He continued hurriedly pressing, instead of obviously just picking up the call while its locked. His new heterosexual thumbprints transmitting a new code to the phone, upgrading it to a more well-off high-end brand that the new youth minister could afford. He was in business after all, as his last name comes into play, a new photo of biblical verses overtook the starting screen as Mr Chen swiped open his new Cisdroid Rush.<br />
<br />
On the home page, brand new apps replaced the old ones. Gone were gaydre and photos of hunks as new, ‘Christian’ friendly apps such as  ‘humble’ took over, a social media app that strictly prevents sexual perversion...strange, he could have sworn it was one of those leftist apps...well even if it was-glad finally someone decided to set it straight!<br />
<br />
Other than that, a large flash washed the screen, turning the hunky man home screen photo into a picture of him and...<br />
<br />
“Oh lordy...,she’s beautiful”<br />
Gorgeous is calling-<br />
“Hey Gorgeous~”<br />
“Hey Handsome~”<br />
<br />
Instantly called, and tented at the sound of her soft sweet voice, the good Christian man identified his partner to be as a her. Boys were supposed to chase after girl and definitely not other guys as God intended that way.<br />
<br />
And why would he ? He was a strong, capable man. He should be protecting the ladies! Especially with how strong and manly he is, why would he want a guy to touch him?<br />
<br />
That would be totally gay!<br />
<br />
Youth ministry Chen was still flabbergasted by that gorgeous voice. But he had to make the first move despite feeling like it was their first date again. He was the man after all.<br />
<br />
“Just finished the paperwork with Uncle Chen, on our way to our-*cough*”<br />
<br />
The Junior Chen coughed, vocal chords and neck shifting equally as it regressed slightly with age-growing in masculinity despite sounding more boyish than ever, bulge prominently out-he thumped two bumps into his chest as his new voice took hold.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?”<br />
“*Cough* I’m fine...must have caught...”<br />
<br />
He paused, a cheekiness arose from the cheeks as he delivered the Chen’s famous line.<br />
<br />
“THE GHEYYYY!”<br />
“Haha eww!”<br />
“Just kidding gorgeous, y’know I’m immune to that....besides, my eyes are only for you~”<br />
“Haha...aw”<br />
<br />
He was madly in love with her.<br />
<br />
With every footstep, his new life adjusted itself to be appropriate for a handsome, christian man such as himself. Not bothering about his disproportionate clothing as he stepped out- trusting he would be clothed in the name of-<br />
<br />
A pair of cisverse high tops coupled his asian tastic feet, laces styling on the black faced top as they looked mildly worn out as though he had been running with those shoes for a long time. Those lucky white soles still itchin’ for more, never giving up.<br />
<br />
No more swaying of the hips! For a true man walks firm and straight with the lord, down the path and into the ways of righteousness. Those short hismudas had to EXTEND and crawl down his toned thighs, down those dusted knees until past his ankles, layering the tops of his sneakers like a curtain as the typical sandblasted jeans hung his gym-goer legs like how God holds you in times of crisis.<br />
<br />
No more loose wearing tees! As the soft felt top grew layers, two of em as the lower one trailed down his university man’s arms. Stretching firmly with his toned muscles like how his future wife is only going to motivate him to become even stronger.<br />
<br />
Wifi signal receiving reception from Lennard’s data plan, a boy next door whose an overall nice guy amd a heartthrob for the ladies. With three lines replicating a signal imprinted at the front of his shirt. Abdominal Stitch branded, the one all male models proudly wear out. He would not mind being one, might as well bring some light into the industry, but his family business comes first.<br />
<br />
As he headed to the washroom mirror, a cross necklace hung from his neck. Continuously answering his beloved’s responses, he observed his facial appearance, frowning initially at that really gay looking Italian man before ‘Clarissa’ was in his reflection.<br />
<br />
She was his other half after all!<br />
<br />
Training so hard and making the bible his life, his family business took hold as Italian was erased from his genetic code, instead-replaced with those of an American born chinese. No wonder him and bro Joel had clique so well from their love of God, fitness, and the fact they were of the same race!<br />
<br />
His chin squared off at the end, as a stylish goatee donned below his lips which thinned out due to his new heritage. His nose became thinner and angular as he became as humble as his genes could see.<br />
<br />
His hair however...<br />
<br />
More like wild grass as it sprouted in a spiky short yet appropriate fashion, long locks/side burns/bangs trimmed, gelled up at the edges and similar to his uncle Wayne. Man was he a cool dude, specially letting a young guy like himself take over for a while despite the increasing amount of liberals around his age gaying up everything...sure him and his uncle tried to be nice but man! <br />
<br />
The Chens are a straight family! He certainly won’t let his uncle down by ensuring no rainbows influence their business.<br />
<br />
As he closed his eyes briefly, staying true to the straight and narrow as his eyes became an innocent bliss. Large monitors of his new life overwhelmed the formerly gay man’s heart, which now is so desperately wanting to be straight.<br />
<br />
Having spent his entire lifetime in church was his new truth, ‘praying every ounce of gay away’ as he could only recall crushing on women but never having the courage to even ask any one of them out until uncle wayne and his buddies helped in.<br />
<br />
The fading gay guy, who could not resist it anymore....gave in. His stylish brows furrowed, epicanthic folds filled up as he BLINKED! <br />
<br />
POOF!<br />
“Aw man! Clarrisa is the one for me!”<br />
<br />
Smoke clearing up, as the spiky haired asian, Daniel Chen, blushed inside out as he smiled at the gorgeous lady’s ‘reflection’ in front of him, almost effortlessly as he looked at her lovingly as though she was his everything. <br />
<br />
Placing his left palm at the back at his head, mind doing simultaneously as he gave a wide toothy grin, closing his eyes as an attempt to hide his incredible blush. Opening the doors out of the restroom with a quick SWOOP!<br />
<br />
“Wanna go get some burgers Honey bunch?”<br />
“Sure Peekaboo, anything you want.”<br />
<br />
THROB!</p>
