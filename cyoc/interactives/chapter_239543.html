<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was still hellbent on defying the curse and with her last energy kicked Justin&#39;s knee which cause him to fall on top of them all. Justin was fuming. Jennifer had done it again and showed the big guy who&#39;s the boss around here. Instead Jennifer was met by something she wasn&#39;t prepared for. Justin glanced Jennifer with teeth clentching disgust on his face. The anger he displayed looked childish. A kid who had never grown up. Almost tearing from what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you did it.&quot; Justin said while wiping his tears. &quot;I saw it with my own eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me you 5th generational piece of overgrown sperm. I&#39;m the boss here and you are my play thing. No one. And I mean, no one. Does that to me. Understood!!?&quot; Justin shouted as she lunged and threw Jennifer to the ground like a ragdoll.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t do anything. She was getting punish... but... but... She loved it... Jennifer cackled and showed with the thumb and index finger what she thought about Justin&#39;s size while blocking her devilish smiling mouth with her other arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!? Are you...? Are you insulting ME!?&quot; Justin shrieked. &quot;You! You!! You little sick little fuck!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt another orgasm as Justin kicked her in the stomach. Jennifer couldn&#39;t believe it. She was enjoying this even when she was treated this roughly. Justin was lifting and dragging Jennifer by her long hair to the living room where Justin have had enough of Jennifer&#39;s defying nature. Justin took piece of tape and placed it in Jennifer&#39;s mouth. Then he wrote something on it. This was making Jennifer even more wet as she couldn&#39;t keep her legs straight and the marker slipped in Justin&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what you did you...&quot; Justin begun to shout but that gave him an idea.<br />
<br />
Dragging Jennifer back to the bedroom she witness how Justin begun to write scribbles on her grandma and mother. Both parents now filled with marker lines and other universal offensive self-made tattoos. The scene made Jennifer protest as she wanted more. Until Justin turned to face Jennifer and Justin released his artistic side. Drawing all kind of things on Jennifer and calling her &#39;broken&#39;, &#39;degenerate&#39; and &#39;unwanted trash&#39;. Jennifer was delighted by this and begged from Justin to make her life even more hell that it had been.<br />
<br />
The usual time meant for Justin was turning into an hour where he called someone yet again asking weird questions. A thing that stuck with Jennifer was the bit, &quot;...are you okay if I treat one of them a bit rougher than usual? Oh? I can? Thanks Daddy! You&#39;re are the best! Love you!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then like a lightining bolt out from a clear sky Jennifer felt another orgasm as Justin was getting even rougher. The kid gloves were taken off. Jennifer heard Justin cracking his knuckles and unleashing his pent up anger on Jennifer. There was an orgasm after another as Jennifer&#39;s body was in full stimuli. Jennifer felt exhausted but somehow Justin wanted to continue. More vaginal releases until she had come so much that her brain shut her mind. Justin tied her hands and then legs together with a rope he found on the floor as he was done playing with her.<br />
<br />
Waking in the middle of the night. Jennifer felt used but loved it. Like a trash that has been discarded. She was on the living room floor all tied up ready to be dunked on once more. She had gained a new thing that she wasn&#39;t even aware of. The constant defying had made her a brat. A brat that she loved to be. A brat that she thought Justin loved. The thought of Justin&#39;s presense made her heart beat faster. She couldn&#39;t touch herself even if she wanted to which made her even more wet. She wanted more love taps from her hubby... ahh... huh? Love taps? What are love taps? Jennifer came back to her senses. Luci had taken over her again. Why was it so dark already? How long Luci has been in control? Jennifer felt weird as the sudden pain shocked her. Jennifer teared up how bad the pain was. Had she been hit by a car or worse? Her logical side couldn&#39;t understand what was going on. It was like as if her brain was blocking everything that had happened. Last thing she remembers was when she opened the door and fell to the floor. Now she&#39;s older and... What is being bound by rope and what that tape in her mouth?<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to find something she could see how fucked up thing had gotten this time. Jennifer looked to the Justin&#39;s fuck den and saw younger Mary who looked more like her mother and with there was a older woman that looked like Mary&#39;s mother or was it Mary? Something wasn&#39;t adding up. Where was her own mother? Where&#39;s Sylvia? Jennifer turned around in the floor and tried to rise her head upwards to spot her but Jennifer struggled to find her in the sea of siblings. Then Jennifer looked at her own body noticed that she looked bigger and older. How? How was older? Didn&#39;t mess ups usually lead into regressing rather than progressing? What had happened to her during her absence?</p>
