<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I... I want to be the perfect man for some guy I know. That's why I've been working out extra hard.&quot; Guy said to Mr. Yaun, feeling slightly embarrassed for telling the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see, young one, I see. But 'the perfect man' is a very vague thing to work with.&quot; Mr. Yaun replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be stronger, taller, more... Er, sexually satisfying. If I were his perfect man, he'd be all over me. I want to be nine inches taller, have a hundred more pounds of muscle, and have a slightly larger penis. But Raimundo doesn't like hairy guys, so can you make all my body hair fall off... And not the hair on my head!&quot; Guy specified, feeling his face grow red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you wish to be more virile, yet appear waxed, then? That can easily be arranged. I shall mix up a little something that will make you taller, stronger, almost fully-hairless, and enlarge other properties as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No side-effects?&quot; Guy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;None at all. But be aware, this will just change your looks. Your personality is a factor as well to keep in mind - do you think this person would like you? Doing this type of thing may be irreversible, and you may find your new-self to be unbearable. Will you still do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raimundo likes me. He's a big, strong guy and he just wants another big guy to be with. It's not because he's shallow, but because Rai wants a lover who can... You know... Handle his size without getting hurt. The poor guy hasn't even gotten laid once, because of him being so huge... I want to be his first, I want to be his last. Once I do this, we can be together...&quot; Guy drifted off, hoping it were true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Your eyes twinkle at the mentioning of this man. I can see that your mind is already up, young one. I shall go make your order, and Rai will have a man who he can love inside and out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Yaun shuffled to the back of the store, followed by obnoxious clanks of what Guy thought was pottery. Guy waited there for about 15 minutes, with nothing but Raimundo running through his mind.<br />
<br />
Rai was an amazing guy in so many ways. For starters, he was a Latino, with beautifully tanned skin. He was about 6'8&quot; and had pounds of glorious muscle stacked on to his frame, amounting to around 380 pounds or so of muscle. Every inch of him was well defined, and he often waxed, since he didn't like body hair all that much. Raimundo was well endowed, but he usually kept himself covered. He was rather shy for a muscle man, and always began to blush when someone would mention his muscles or touch his muscles. His face was something out off of a magazine cover, perfect in every dimension - or at least that's what Guy thought. His smile, made of straight, pearly-whites, captivated anyone who saw it. Then there was his charming eyes, taking on a wondrous blue color.<br />
<br />
Guy on the other hand, was only 5'10&quot;, and weighed around 200 pounds. Rai always commented on Guy's beautiful green eyes and handsome face. Guy was a bit cockier than Rai, showing off the goods when he could. Which probably made Raimundo feel terrible. Sometimes he'd find Rai getting lost in his visage, then Rai would look away as if he were ashamed. Guy knew what Raimundo was thinking, and Guy felt sorry for him. Raimundo would always bringing it up, acting as if his amazing bulk was a curse. Guy would constantly comfort him, and say it was okay, but he knew it wasn't enough. The more Guy thought about it, the more Guy thought Raimundo was right... Being so madly in love with a man who you couldn't even kiss or hold without the possibility of hurting him - now that's a curse. But after this change, all would be well. Guy would be big enough to handle Raimundo's strength and size, then they will be able to be together in more ways than one...<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to disturb your day-dream, but your order is ready.&quot; Mr. Yaun interrupted, placing a bag up on the counter. &quot;This is bath salt. You place it in warm water and stir the water up after it settles for one or so minutes. Then you sit in the bathtub for about ten minutes. Stay any longer than ten minutes and the effects will be greater than you originally wanted - but not by freakish proportions. . . Unless you were to stay in the tub for an hour. Just be sure to not doze off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy snatched the pouch off the counter and took a wiff of it. The smell was alluring and comforting, which surprised Guy. He was expecting something that smelled like rotten eggs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mr. Yaun. I can't wait to use this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you are so very eager. I should say this, however... When confronted with a strange situation, you should be honest.&quot; Mr. Yaun said, causing Guy to cock his head to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the one you love seeks the truth, it's best not to lie. Most men or women who change lie about so many things, and before they realize it, they have become a different person. If this Raimundo is in love with the Guy I have seen today, then it is best that you try to stay the same, even if the outside will look drastically different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the sudden uh... Words of wisdom?&quot; Guy was now totally confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoy making others happy, whether it be giving them magical concoctions or passing on wisdom.&quot; Mr Yaun said, adding a slight smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I get it. If he asks how I changed, I just say the truth... And I guess not lie about other things... That's doable.&quot; Guy agreed. It was strange and random advice, but it was good advice nevertheless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also, if you are seeking a job, perhaps you could work for me. With your soon-to-be new stature, you could easily move ingredients around for me.&quot; Mr. Yaun added, letting out a small laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'd be happy to take you up on that offer, Mr. Yaun. But you'd best wait a week to hear from me. I'll be busy. Anyway, I think I should be going now to use this before I waste my whole afternoon. See ya!&quot; Guy said, as he darted out the door - only leaving enough time for Mr. Yaun to wave his hand.</p>
