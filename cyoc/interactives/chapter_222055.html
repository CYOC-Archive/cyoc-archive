<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Max liked the idea of growing Holly more, and maybe shrinking Molly a tad more, he felt that things were getting repetitive, not just for him. Sure, he could change them in broad daylight as opposed to the night, but would that really change things up all that much. He just recently got this machine and didn&#39;t want to get bored of the possibilities ahead already. So he endulged in having some fun from others experiencing the same joy he had. He went back to the machine and layed some ground rules.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF I ALWAYS HAD A FULL VIEW OF HOLLY AND MOLLY AS IF I&#39;M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM WHENEVER I WANT TO?<br />
<br />
That should be plenty enough to keep up-to-date without being all too creepy or suspicious.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF A DEVICE THAT COULD CHANGE HER OWN BODY IN VARIOUS WAYS APPEARED IN FRONT OF HER WITH A FLASH? WHAT IF THAT DEVICE HAD A NOTE NEXT TO IT THAT EXPLAINED IN ALL TO HER WITHOUT GIVING ME AWAY? WHAT IF THE DEVICE WAS HANDY BUT UNSUSPICIOUS TO ONLOOKERS?<br />
<br />
After the input was done, Max watched closely as Holly suddenly stopped inspecting her body as she was blinded by a bright light. She wondered what it was, but that got answered all by itself immediately. In front of her layed a golden wristwatch, similar to a smartwatch but with a slightly bigger screen. Next to it layed a small note with all the information that was needed.<br />
<br />
&#39;I hope you&#39;ve liked fate&#39;s reward up until now, but I&#39;m here to give you yet another gift. Do not question who or what I am, I am far too much for you to even comprehend. Take this device instead of insignificant answers. This device has been bestowed with the power to freely change your, and only your, body. Everything is reversable with a single input, so do not be scared of trying it out without any knowledge. Make your own destiny and follow the will of fate.&#39;<br />
<br />
Max read the note as well and was unsure if such an obviously comic-y, magic note would even work. But as soon as Holly got a hold of the watch as fast as she could, he knew things were going exactly as he wanted.<br />
<br />
Holly couldn&#39;t believe her good fortune... well, or fate, in this case. The band was a bit too big, but as soon as she placed the watch on her wrist, the band automatically shrunk down to the perfect size. She didn&#39;t know why, but it felt as if nobody could seperate this device from her ever again.<br />
<br />
To her it looked like a totally normal watch, and it was, but as soon as her right hand got close enough to the screen, it changed abruptly and showed a list of several options, as well as a option for full body view. Out of curiosity, she chose the &#39;height&#39; option and was met with a stat of her current height, 7&#39;10&quot;, and a slider next to it. The slider was up to a mere third of the bar, but what she didn&#39;t know is that these sliders could be extended much, much more if she got close to the visible end.<br />
<br />
With a mix of excitement and joy, she slid it up to almost halfway, seeing the stat beside it change to 9 full feet. She pressed the button labeled &#39;adapt to changes&#39; beside the buttons &#39;reverse last change&#39; and &#39;revert all changes&#39; and was met with an exhilarating feeling. She&#39;s never been able to catch one of her two &#39;growth spurts&#39;, if you can even call them that, so seeing her body slowly rise up in front of the mirror in combination with an almost orgasmic feeling was amazing. As her torso and limbs lengthened too, the watch adapted to her slightly thicker wrist and lower arm as well, fitting as perfectly as before.<br />
<br />
Whereas before she could only she her boobs and below in the mirror, it was now hanging so absurdly low that her lower abs were barely visible from her perspective. Her head was getting dangerously close to the already high ceiling, leaving no more than a foot of air between each other.<br />
<br />
Now that she know how to change herself (and how great it felt), she was up to try a few more settings. Looking back at the height option, she saw that a checkmark was set on &#39;keep current proportions&#39;. This was already very helpful with the last change, but it was good to know she could change without keeping them.<br />
<br />
She chose the muscle setting next, wanting to see just how big they&#39;d have to get to not look sexy anymore. Sadly (Or gladly), one of the things she didn&#39;t know was that no matter the change, the device would pretty much always try to ensure her being just as sexy as before, or more than that.<br />
<br />
There was the same familiar slider again, but this time instead of a stat, there was automatically a rough depiction of her body without any ficial features. Almost like a blank, blue 3D model. She thought it looked just about the same as her own body (exactly as her, to be precise) and grabbed the slider that was about halfway up the bar. She kept going until she reached about eighty percent of the way, just shy of extending the slider.<br />
<br />
The 3D model looked absolutely massive, but she still wanted to try this size. Just before she applied the changes, the small submenu called &#39;similar options&#39; poked her interest. There were many options displayed, such as &#39;muscle density&#39; or &#39;flexibility&#39;, but what caught her eye the most was the &#39;strength&#39; option. She pressed on it and was moved to another menu with a slider, this one showing the stat &#39;1x&#39;. The slider was almost at the bottom, so Holly pulled it up a little until the stat showed &#39;2.5x&#39;. She looked away from the screen and back to her bulging biceps, wondering if so much strength was really the way to go. But since she&#39;s always been careful and sensitive and that, to her knowledge, literal &#39;fate&#39; has given her all this power to play with, she was sure it would be alright.<br />
<br />
Not letting herself get distracted again, Holly applied the changes and was flooded with an equal part orgasmic pleasure and the feeling of stretched skin being brought to its limit. Right beside her, the unflexed biceps expanded with what felt like neverending vigor, not stopping until it almost resembled their previous flexed state.<br />
<br />
Her back muscles got so big and strong that her huge breasts felt weightless to her. Her sixpack grow to an eightpack and kept getting bigger and sturdier. Her already massive thighs practically eclipsed the width of her waist and thanks to the help of her hips, she was somehow still sporting a thigh gap between all those mountains of muscle. Her calves, now the size of ripe honeymelons rippled with every small step she took. Her pecs still stayed comparably small, being fully overshadowed by her greatly-endowed boobs.<br />
<br />
Lastly, her wrecking ball asscheeks expanded in size until an entire forearm could be lost between them. Of course, in the process they would be processed into bone splinters and fine dust, but that might as well be worth it to some.<br />
<br />
Just as she thought her changes were over, another orgasmic wave, even better than before flowed through her. The already utterly strong, huge muscles got infused with even more impossible strength, practically compressing two and a half titanesses the size of her into herself.<br />
<br />
With the changes finally done, she ducked to inspect her mighty arms first, but accidentally hit the wall behind her with her far too hard butt, leaving two identical spherical shapes in it, accompanied by many cracks around them. She was glad the wall behind her was fairly thick, otherwise the neighbors would&#39;ve been greeting by the most fabulous ass on earth.<br />
<br />
Now more careful of her fragile surroundings, she flexed her arm slowly, but surely, watching it gain inch after inch without seeming to ever stop. It just about reached the bottom of the screen of the watch, getting dangerously close to wrist-level. Next she watched her abs in the mirror, first taking a deep breath and seeing them expand in response, but them slowly flex them while exhaling, watching the steelbeam-like abs getting crunching against each other and densening to mind-boggling degrees.<br />
<br />
With her muscles this big, she was a bit scared that she could accidentally become immobile with a wrong move, so the looked up flexibility and turned that from &#39;1x&#39; to 5x&#39;, thinking that it would be enough. But  in reality, even with her muscles this big, she could flex her body in ways that could never be achieved by any other human.<br />
<br />
But now that her muscles have grown this big, her once massive tits looked oddly small on her frame, so she went back to the option list and picked &#39;breast size&#39;. Her boobs were already so big that simple cupsized would practically be useless to comprehend soon, so instead of that the device showed her the 3D model again. She increasing her bust until they appeared to be bigger than pumpkins, laaarge pumpkins. On the side, she experimented with another suggested option called &#39;breast perkiness&#39;. Right now they looked just about natural with a rather large sag to them, but that was just her imagination.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were already far perkier than they should&#39;ve been, but their sheer size was too much since Max wasn&#39;t the one in control anymore. At first, she increased the perkiness to make them look like bowling balls were attached to her chest, but she was curious since the slider was only two thirds of the way there. This slider didn&#39;t extend in length after some point, so as Holly reached the maximum, her breasts looked like they were held aloft by an invisible force, her nipples facing in a 45-degree angle into the sky. Chuckling about how absurd this looked, she lowered the bar to about fourty percent, leaving her boobs perky but with enough of a slight sag to them to make them appear and feel natural.<br />
<br />
After applying the changes, her pussy was already soaking wet by all the other changes, so she couldn&#39;t help herself and stained the bathroom floor a bit with her love juices. Now her boobs overshadowed parts of her abs again, looking pretty much at home on her super-amazonian body.<br />
<br />
Scrolling through the options again, Holly saw the &#39;butt size&#39; option, but was already quite happy with her rear thanks to the mighty increase in muscle mass back there. So the scrolled some more but didn&#39;t find anything interesting... at least not yet.<br />
<br />
Thinking back to the &#39;keep current proportions&#39; checkbox, she was in for an experiment with the &#39;height&#39; option again. She selected it and after unchecking the box, another options appeared beneath stating &#39;automatic reversal of change&#39;. She figured out that it was a failsafe build into the device if she wished to have one, and after checking the box for it, she had to select a timer. She chose a minute and kept going.<br />
<br />
With her current height of 9 feet, everything looked like it belonged on her body, even the rediculous, various sizes. So after lowering the height to a mere 6&#39;6&quot;, she pressed the apply button, knowing that even if things turned out badly the device would have her back.<br />
<br />
This time the changes didn&#39;t feel orgasmic but rather... dull. She guessed that shrinking just couldn&#39;t feel as good as growing, but weirdly there was still this sense of growing. That was mainly because of her gigantic muscle needing to fit on a comparably tiny frame. Her biceps were overflowing her arms, her abs fighting for what little space they had and her thighs were pushing each other away as best as they could. Her abs couldn&#39;t be seen at all anymore, her humongous boobs fully covering them with ease. Her butt was getting s big that it was touching her own back and thighs, growing vigorously under the pressure.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself again after the changes were done, the once amazonian wall of muscle and huge curves was now a tall woman with literal mountains of muscle covering everything she had to offer with breasts and an ass straight from hentai. Normally, Holly shouldn&#39;t have been able to move a single inch, but thanks to er overestimation of her flexibility, she was just as flexible as she would have been without any enhancements.<br />
<br />
This surprised her, so out of curiosity she flexed both of her arms, her biceps and triceps exploding in size, keeping her head in a prison of muscles they shot up far, far above her hands. Before she could test them out any further, she was already being reversed by the device, growing foot after foot and inch after inch to her pervious 9 foot height.<br />
<br />
Now things felt right again, and the growth was as pleasurable as before, which weridly calmed her. She really didn&#39;t want to lose that feeling with the press of a button anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Looking at the small note on the sink again, she wondered how she could &#39;appreciate&#39; this gift of fate next.</p>
