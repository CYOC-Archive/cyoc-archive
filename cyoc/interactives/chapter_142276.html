<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was looking forward to return to dorm life after a summer with his mother back home, he missed dorm life and the laughs he shared with his friends whilst studying. John had decided to return to the dorms rather than paying out for his own accommodation. John’s friend Mark would also be joining him in the Senior dorm. John had not seen Mark since they broke up for the summer so he was keen to catch up with his good friend. <br />
<br />
John arrived at the dorm building and went up to the third floor where the senior dorm was located. The senior dorm was huge in comparison to the previous dorms we stayed in. John was use to a small room with 4-5 guys in bunks with an adjoining bathroom the new dorm was huge and reminded him of dorms he has seen in army films with bunks down either side of the room, the dorm was empty, John was obviously the first back from the summer break so he took the opportunity to explore the new surroundings. He walked down the middle of the bunks towards the back of the room, the back wall was tiled and had two gaps one on the left and right, on closer inspection John relealised this was the showers he walked through the long corridor behind the wall through to the other gap. The corridor was completely tiled and had at least 30 shower heads, John had never had to shower like this before in his previous dorms the smaller set up meant you had always showered alone.   John wasn’t the most developed 18 year old he stood at just over 5’6” with Dark hair he was good looking but had only really started to develop facial hair and lacked any hair on his chest and his pits had only just stared to fill out, the thought of suddenly having to shower in front of people made him nervous but knowing how much he enjoyed dorm life before he tried to crush his concerns and carried on exploring. He thought better than to pick a bed at least until anyone else had arrived in case he caused a scene before he had even settled in!  As he walked back into the dorm he noticed that Mark had just dropped his bags at the door, having not seen Mark since they broke up for summer John walked over and could visibly see that Mark had grown over the summer!  “Woah! Mark” John said as he approached Mark “what have you been eating” Mark chuckeled and gave John a hug, “haha yeah I’ve shot up a bit, I’m 6ft 2 now!” Said Mark as he looked down at John. “You’ve grown a beard too!” John exclaimed as he stood back from the hug. “Yeah I’ve given up shaving everyday it just grows back to quick” Mark laughed. John looked on in envy as he smiled having not seen his friend in so long.  <br />
<br />
As John and Mark were catching up several guys entered the dorm and head over to what must have been “their” bunk, John and Mark were quickly directed to two bottom bunks at the end of the room, the bunks were not the best or most comfy, but at least they didn’t have to worry about taking someone else’s bunk. <br />
<br />
Night time quickly fell and Mark and John had kept to themselves rather than interfere with the mass catch up that seemed to be going on amongst the others in the dorm, John decided to call it a night and put himself to bed in his bunk wearing a T-shirt and boxers hoping he’d be warm enough. <br />
<br />
Mark wasn’t far behind him but being a hot sleeper he left his top off once he got into the bunk. <br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Splash!! John was awoken abruptly a bucket of water had been chucked over him - waking up in a daze he slowly started to focus - his bunk was surrounded by what seemed to be the whole dorm, as his eyes came round he saw what looked like 20 guys standing in their pants around his bunk. <br />
<br />
“So who do we have here” beckoned a voice. John looked up to see a tall dark hair guy pointing at him.  “I’m Scott and I am in charge round here, if you want to be part of this dorm you should have come through me!”  John looked at Scott, Scott was at least 6’4” and had an evil glint in his eye, he had a full dense dark beard and was covered in dark body hair from his beard across his chest and down to his pants the hair then spread down both his legs. He also had to large bushes of armpit hair sticking out his pits - John had never seen so much hair on a guy around his age.  John looked around and noticed that Scott had two guys either side of him who were also covered in hair with beards one blonde guy and whilst the others were dark like Scott.  Further back be noticed some other guys behind Scott and his “henchman” that were smooth, he had to do a double take as he also saw they were naked and completly hairless. John felt slightly better about himself after seeing them thinking at least he had more hair than someone in the dorm. <br />
<br />
He heard a cough and turned around to see Mark behind him standing next to his bunk he had also had water thrown at him you could tell because his chest hair was dripping with water.. Chest hair! Thought John... Mark never had chest hair before, he really had grown up over the summer. <br />
<br />
Mark was standing in his pants his chest hair had clumped together where it had got wet, he too had hair over his legs and hair sticking out his pits.. John felt envious of Mark at this point but thought back to the naked hairless guys behind Scott.. why they were naked John thought he had no idea. <br />
<br />
Splash! Scott throw yet another bucket of water over him!<br />
<br />
Strip he demanded!<br />
<br />
John and Mark began to strip... not you shouted Scott as he pointed to Mark...<br />
<br />
You are one of us, come here Scott demanded. <br />
<br />
Mark walked over to Scott... Scott ran his hand through Mark’s chest hair and grinned. “We have a rule for our type, do not shave whilst you are here and you can be part of our brethren, if you shave then we will shave all of you and you can be a sissy like them”. Scott pointed to the naked hairless guys behind him. <br />
<br />
“Guys who can’t grow hair properly like him” pointing at John “shouldn’t have hair at all!”  “Sissy’s in this dorm are to remain hairless and serve us, they don’t get the privilege of clothes and you can use them however use please”. He laughed as he pulled out his hairy flaccid cock. John gullped his cock was as big flaccid as his was erect. Mark smirked at Scott. <br />
<br />
“Now if you wish to join us and not be made into a sissy you will have to turn him into a sissy” Scott sadistically said as he handed Mark a set of clippers whilst pointing at John.</p>
