<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let’s go over to Betty&#39;s birthday party, you did say that I needed to visit them.&quot; Melody burst out<br />
&quot;Great idea. We can entertain the girls and maybe get some of the mothers to help with a smile.&quot;<br />
Both of them started to waddle out of the house with a little trouble getting use to their new feet. They went across the street to the party and opened the door without an invitation.<br />
&quot;CLOWNS! Hey, mommy look clowns.&quot; one of the little girls had spotted them when they came in and announced their presence to the entire house with excitement. Betty&#39;s mother came out looking a little confused.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t ask any clowns to come?&quot; she looked at the clowns slowly recognizing them &quot;Oh my god. Susan, Melony? I didn&#39;t know you did clowning?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yea. Melody and I learn just recently and thought that we could come and have some fun at the party. We brought some cookies for you.&quot; Susie held up the basket of cookies<br />
&quot;Ha, great. Come on in to the kitchen and drop them off.&quot; Sandra led them in to the kitchen where four other mothers were there chatting.<br />
&quot;Hey everyone these are my neighbors Melody and.....&quot; &quot;Susie&quot; Susie finished the sentence for her &quot;Susie. They thought they would come over and clown around, hehe.&quot; This was met with a chorus of laughter and agreements.<br />
&quot;We brought some of my special silly hearts to put a smile on your face.&quot; She handed one out to each of the mothers. They looked at the a little suspiciously coming from a clown but one of them tried it and let out a load moan and smiled.<br />
&quot;These are wonderful&quot; she exclaimed and immediately ate the rest of it. The rest of the mothers ate theirs and had similar reactions. The mothers stood there with a faraway look on their faces and a big smile. They start to giggle and laugh at each other giggling and laughing. One of the mothers took off her shoes and started to rub her feet absently. Melody and Susie saw and looked at each other with big smiles.<br />
&quot;Let’s go entertain the girls&quot; Susie announced and everyone went into the living room all of the mothers leaving their shoes behind and clumsily tripping over their growing feet followed. <br />
&quot;Hello, girls. You want to see a show?&quot; This question was met with a loud response of agreement. Susie and Melody moved to the front of the living room, Melody &#39;tripping&#39; did a summersault and stood right back up to a roar of laughter from the girls.<br />
&quot;First, we need a volunteer. How about a mom help us?&quot; One of the mothers came forward and waddled her way up to the front laughing. Her pants were strain to contain her butt now and her skin was starting to go pale.<br />
&quot;Do you know why the skeleton couldn&#39;t cross the road?&quot;<br />
&quot;No&quot;<br />
&quot;Because he didn&#39;t have any guts&quot; Everyone laughed the mothers doubled over in laughter as their skin got paler and their breast started to push against their shirts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why the turkey crossed the road?&quot; The mother laughed and shrugged.<br />
&quot;To prove he wasn&#39;t a chicken&quot; More laughter from the crowd as the mothers felt a surge of tingles through their body almost pushing them to a orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now for some Magic Tricks&quot; Susie pulls a stuffed rabbit from behind her back.<br />
“I shall now pull a hat from this rabbit&quot; She reached into the stuffed rabbits mouth and pulls out a black circle that pops open to a top hat. She places the hat on the mother’s head which immediately fell over her face because it is too big. The mother tries to pull it up but it is stuck.<br />
&quot;Oops, let’s try the other way&quot; Susie pulls the hat down fast down to her feet and the top and out comes the mother transformed into a clown.<br />
&quot;WOW&quot; shouts the crowd as the new clown strikes a pose. She now has long curly purple hair, a red nose, tiny green stars on her cheeks and a wide red smile. Her clothes changed to a bright outfit of yellow blouse, pink pants and large purple shoes.<br />
&quot;Just call me, Starbright&quot; Everyone applauded the amazing magic trick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let’s have another mother volunteer&quot; Suise motions to one of the other mothers. The mother started to walk up to Susie and tripped on her now large feet and fell flat on her now huge ass that exploded into a sound like a whoopee cushion. This sent everyone even the mother in to fits of laughter. Melody help her up and offered her a silk handkerchief, the mother took it and another one came out of Melody pocket tied to the first one. The mother continued to pull and one after another different color handkerchiefs came out in a chain. Everyone started to laugh as Melody picked up the handkerchiefs and began to run around the mother tying her up. Susie step in and took one end as Melody pulled on the other. In a poof of pink smoke and confetti the handkerchiefs disappeared obscuring the mother who steps out of the smoke as a clown. She now had pink hair going down her back in twin braids, a purple nose and arching thick purple eyebrows. Her top was a low cut tight yellow polka dotted blouse that exposed her now huge tits that spilled out in front of her and her pants were stripped green and blue that spilled over her equally huge ass. She took a bow to the applause and tripped again on to her huge ass to the sound of a whoopee cushion.<br />
&quot;Guess you can call me Tootsie&quot; she announced as she got back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want more magic tricks?&quot; Susie asked the girls &quot;YES&quot; they screamed back<br />
&quot;Ok, but we need another volunteer&quot; All the girls turned and pointed at another one of the mothers who reluctantly walked over to Susie fearing what would happen but giggling all the way.<br />
Susie pulls a book out and hands it to the mother &quot;Ok, this is a magic book. DO NOT OPEN IT or you will turn into a clown too&quot; She shakes her head in understanding, not wanting to be turned into a clown and holds the book closed tight.<br />
&quot;Ok, I need my magic wand, a bag and a ball.&quot; She pulls each out of her pocket and hands the bag and ball to one of the girls.<br />
&quot;Place the ball in the bag&quot; She instructs the girl and after she had complied she tapped the bag and yelled &quot;Disappearo&quot;<br />
The girl then turned the bag inside out to show the ball was gone. Susie taps the bag again and the girl looks into the bag expecting the ball to return but finds it empty.<br />
&quot;Hmm.... I forgot the magic word. Can you look it up in the book?&quot; She asked the mother with the book. <br />
She opens the book and a hand on a spring launched a cream pie with a cherry on to right into her face. Everyone laughed and the mothers in the back fell over with laughter. The mother used her hands to clear the cream away from her eyes but the white stayed on her already pale skin and joined in the laughter the cherry stuck on the end of her nose.<br />
&quot;Here let me help you&quot; Melody said as she pulled out a HUGE human sized handkerchief and threw it over her and wiped off her face. When she pulled back the handkerchief the crowd gasped as she was now a clown. Her hair had turned bright red into a short bob cut with white skin a sparkling red nose and three tiny cherry freckles on each cheek.<br />
&quot;Tada&quot; she announced with a flourish &quot;I am now Cherry-O&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need two brave volunteers to put a smile on?&quot; All the girls raised their hands in excitement hoping to be picked. The two mothers in back were loopy form the cookie, giggling to themselves but a little wary after seeing what happened to their friends. Tootsie walked over and raised the hand of the two mothers. The mothers looked at Tootsie and laughed and looked a little horrified at being volunteered. Tootsie walked them up to the front as Melody pulled two flat boxes out from behind her back and set them down. Melody then reached down and pulled them up and expanded them to two open cabinets. A shirt button broke from one of the mothers shirts and hit Susie right in the eye to the laughter of the girls.<br />
&quot;Oops *giggle*, guess I should have *giggle* worn a bigger shirt *giggle*&quot; she said as she tries to restrain her growing breasts.<br />
&quot;Well you’re in luck, these are magic cabinets that will release the inner you.&quot; Both mothers knew what that would mean but were unable to form coherent thoughts to resist and just laughed. The clowns forced them into the cabinets with each of the mothers not wanting to go in and closed the doors.<br />
&quot;And now say the magic words &#39;Fuzzy Pickles&#39;&quot; As Susie raised a fairy wand and waited<br />
&quot;FUZZY PICKELS&quot; the shout came from the young girls and the clowns and Susie wave her wand and with a poof of smoke the cabinets collapsed. There stood the mothers now whiteface clowns. The young girls expecting this after the last transformations collapsed in applause, cheering that their mothers were now clowns.<br />
&quot;Time for a song&quot; Susie led the girls in a parade around the house singing a nonsensical song. They goofed around all day as time flew by and answers to the ringing of cell phones were ignored. Finally two of the fathers who were having a guys day out while the girls were out stopped by to see what happened to their family. They were greeted by their daughters running up excitedly to them.<br />
&quot;Dad! Guess what?&quot; being too excited to wait for a guess, she blurted out &quot;Mom&#39;s a clown&quot;<br />
&quot;What sweetie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mommy is a clown!&quot; they dragged their fathers out to the backyard were the mothers were hula hooping with the girls. <br />
&quot;Emily?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nora?&quot; The fathers stood there dumb founded at the changes to their wives.<br />
&quot;You can call us Starbright and Tootsie&quot; the clowns said as they approached their husbands.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; they asked admiring their wives new tits and ass and the fact that they were now clowns.<br />
&quot;Susie and Melody came over and put a smile on our faces and we got a bit silly.&quot; Startbright said as she pulled out a couple of cookies &quot;Would you like a cookie?&quot;<br />
The fathers just stood there looking at the cookies unsure if to take anything from a clown.</p>
