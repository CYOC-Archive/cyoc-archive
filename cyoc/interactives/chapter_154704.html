<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hard hoof feet thudded, muffled, into the soft loamy forest floor as James ran. Each step making his breasts bounce deliciously, rock-hard jet-black nipples tipping each swinging mound.<br />
<br />
His run was slightly bow-bow legged as he kept a grip on his hardened horse-cock. Fully the length of his forearm it took two hands for him to fully encircle its girth. <br />
<br />
James was keeping a steady rhythm going as he ran, sweat poring down his naked body. He panted with excitement and exertion, but never slowed, a testament to the amount of travelling he&#39;d been doing over the past few weeks. His running was aimless, reckless, he knew by now that direction never mattered, that in the end he would end up back in the Cabin, or wherever the Cabin wanted him to be, <br />
<br />
And right now he wanted to be with a certain donkey. The flashing thought of her puckered asshole, fat lips, and juicy, juicy cock made James pump his cock extra hard, which in turn threw off his rhythm and he stumbled. Losing his balance he tripped over a root and went tumbling, landing on his back in a pile of leaves. He watched as the his monster cock, dragging by inertia, collided with his chest a moment after he hit the ground. Now laying between his two mounds, James stared at the head of the horse cock, cylindrical with a thick urethra, capable of hosing anything with cum. It kind of looked like Dakota&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Fully taken in lust, and having given in to fucking an animal, James&#39;s mind had been altered to the point that sex with animals no longer felt weird. He still knew it wasn&#39;t accepted externally, or normal, but that didn&#39;t change how he felt. <br />
<br />
Looking at the head of his cock he mused how much it looked like Dakota&#39;s. Delicious. Leaning forward he smashed his breasts around the shaft and opened his mouth wide to suckle on the head. Poking black nipples ran along the length as he licked and sucked the salty sweaty shaft.<br />
<br />
His hips began to buck, poking himself in the face as he forced more sensations from him. The whole time he could feel his taint tingling. <br />
<br />
*Slurp* he pulled back. &quot;I&#39;m making this for you Dakota!&quot; James exhaled as one hand let go of his breasts and he reached under his balls, again coming in contact with the new slick cleft. It felt so soft and silky, and sensuously tender. Sensitive. He poked a finger in experimantally; though it didn&#39;t go in very far he could feel it inside him. Feel even now as his body reshaped, hips widening and finger slipping deeper and deeper as the canal grew. Pulling the finger out he brought it to his nose and took a good sniff, replacing the hand with his other. It went straight to the clit, now budding and thick, and he began to rub. <br />
<br />
Instantly he began seeing lights. It was so much more intense than his cock. If the best sex feeling he had ever had was the senstation of the length of his cock buried in Dakota, this was like that, twice over, concentrated into a small point.<br />
<br />
&quot;F--f-ffuck...&quot; he moaned, writhing on the ground. The hand at his face grabbed one his mound and began to mash it roughly; trying to let the feeling of pleasure in his chest get out. <br />
<br />
He gritted his teeth, sucking air as each rub brought a new sensation. He didn&#39;t even need to touch his cock, the sensations of his new clit alone was enough to keep the shaft feeling like it was going to explode out of itself.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long too for exactly that to happen. The first warning James got, as his mouth opened in a silent orgasmic scream, was the feeling of warm salty fluid shooting directly onto his face and into his mouth. It tasted odd. But good. His mind didn&#39;t manage to think more on it, so addled in the midst of an orgasm as he was.<br />
<br />
He barely registered initially clamping down his mouth on the flaring head as it shot load after load, before becoming so overwhelmed by the volume that he let go, only to release a torrent of collected lumpy, thick, sticky cum down the front of his chest. The shaft, continued to spasm several more times. Enought to liberally coat James&#39;s face in his own spooge.<br />
<br />
By the time his dribbling cock softened enough to lie limp between his painted breasts, James was completely and utterly covered in cum; and the first thought he had was.<br />
<br />
&#39;I wish it was Dakota&#39;s&#39; <br />
<br />
Having cum hard, enough cobwebs had been blown free that James was able to think clearly again, albeit with his now altered mental state.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing!&quot; He asked, not regretfully, but excitedly as he looked over himself. He&#39;d started this day, after two solid weeks of abstinence, as a man. Granted, one with some changes. But definitely a man. <br />
<br />
One encounter with a donkey had changed that; breasts, vagina, covering himself in his own cum. This wasn&#39;t the old him. The old him wanted to be with Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa&quot; He said out loud, as if to convince himself. She was his muse. She would get him out right? He closed his eyes to imagine her and her heavy breasts and dusky curves. Only... As soon as he closed his eyes he saw a furry figure standing bipedal, grabbing a monster cock, muzzle grinning. Butterflies began in his stomach and he felt an ache to run to the figure.<br />
<br />
James shook his head. and opened his eyes. &#39;Dakota! God, he&#39;s sexy&#39;<br />
<br />
As if to counterbalance, he said out-loud. &quot;No! Melissa!&quot; He screwed his eyes shut again. He needed to be sure. He wasn&#39;t addled, he felt relatively together. He could make his mind up. History tore him to try to imagine Melissa, but that feeling of excitement, of longing, of belonging made the figure of a heavily endowed donkey appear again. He tried to think of Melissa&#39;s rose perfume, but could only imagine the earthy smell of Dakota&#39;s donkey dick &#39;Do I..?&#39; His thought trailed off as he heard something echo through the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;HHHAAAAWWWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling that he felt right then, the feeling of excitement, the feeling of warmth and belonging within him was a watershed for the relatively uninfluenced James.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming Dakota&quot; He said as he picked himself up off the ground and began a light jog in the direction of where the call had come from; each step flicking drops off cum from his soaked body, forming a trail behind him.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much longer for the winding ways of the forest to deliver James, slick with sweat and sticky with cum, to a small clearing. Within it stood Dakota the Donkey, blond streak breaking up the otherwise mottled grey and white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; He said, not expecting an answer. Dakota turned at the call. James watched with a growing smile and trenbling hands as Dakota&#39;s nostrils flared, smelling the air, as she trotted forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing!?&quot; James said again out loud, this time with zero fear in his voice, only excitement. As if to answer Dakota whickered softly. Dakota reached James and he let out a soft twitch and giggle as Dakota&#39;s hairy muzzle roamed around him sniffing and brushing his body with bristly hairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dakota I need your help.&quot; He said to the Donkey, but really to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;m a human, and that this place has cursed me. But there&#39;s this feeling in me, which I need to understand, and I need you to help me. I feel like if I let you fuck me I&#39;ll know what I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
James was surprised when Dakota took exactly that moment for his rough tongue to slide out and take a long lick of his cum stained belly. James shiverred and stepped back. He watched with a trembling lip as Dakota&#39;s cock slid from it&#39;s sheath. He stepped forward again, arms wide presenting his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me?&quot; He felt nervous, like kid asking a girl to dance. Like he did the first time he approached Melissa in the gym and asked her for a spot. Only... If only Melissa had been Dakota then.<br />
<br />
He sighed in happiness when Dakota began to lick him with gusto, replacing his lower abdomen from a carpet of cum, to a glaze of donkey saliva. The smell of earthy donkey and grass made his knees weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;God Dakota do you want to fuck me now?&quot; James called, stepping back. Dakota&#39;s cock was fully out and rock hard. James grinned excitedly. &quot;It&#39;s really happening!&quot; He called, thinking &#39;If Dakota fucks me that&#39;s it. I&#39;m his... Her&#39;s? His?&#39;. Taking a few steps before getting on all fours, ass in the air, damp pussy feeling cold even against the oppressive heat of the forest.<br />
<br />
James&#39;s hands dug into the soft earth as his arms trembled in excitement as her heard Dakota sniff and snort in approval, then stomp over. He looked down at his breasts, heavy and dangling, a wonderful pressure on his chest. Tipped with beautiful black nipples.<br />
<br />
He almost felt like throwing up he was so tense and excited. &quot;Oh God!&quot; He called as he felt Dakota&#39;s cold nose brush his pussy. &quot;Am I sexy enough for you?&quot; James asked as Dakota responded by licking the length of his slit and ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yyesss-ss&quot; James hissed as he felt Dakota&#39;s head on the small of his back. Responding to the pressure, James lowered himself to his knees and elbows almost making himself a ball to allow Dakota to step over him. He felt the heaad of Dakota&#39;s donkey dick poke both his ass and pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man. Oh god&quot; James began to chant as his trnebling hand reached back and grasping, found the quiverring donkey dick. Quickly he aligned it with his brand new pussy. &quot;Come on! Please! Let this be true.&quot; James prayed as he rubbed the fat head up and down his slit.<br />
<br />
*HHAAAWWW* Dakota lurched, thrusting the donkey shaft forward at James&#39;s pubic mound. James squealed un-expectedly as he was pitched forward onto the ground, mashing his breasts, wincing in pain. It felt like something had just punched him in the gooch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oww...&quot; He yelped, looking back, donkey dick still hard and right behind him. &quot;Sorry Dakota! My bad! Wasn&#39;t aligned properly!&quot; He got back up to the folded position and edged back until he could get a hold of Dakota&#39;s cock again. This time, instead of rubbing up and down the slit he simply held it at the enterance to his canal, marvelling at the feeling of his new lips parting, trying to wrap around the head.<br />
<br />
*Heee-HAAAAW*. Another thrust, another yelp, and again James found himself eating dirt. This time his lip quivered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; He said. This time he was back under Dakota within seconds, aligned and ready.<br />
<br />
*HEEEEEHAAAAWWW!!!* Again the same result.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. Nooo! NO!&quot; James yelled. A fourth and fifth attempt ended the same way with James eating dirst. Dakota&#39;s too wide donkey dick simply would not fit into James&#39;s virgin human pussy. James, eyes now full of tears as he turned to his back to look at a frustrated looking Dakota, head bobbing, and cock twitching and slapping off his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I&#39;m so sorry Dakotaaa!&quot; James began to bawl. He got up and crawled over to the donkey. He needed to be near him. He kissed it&#39;s flank and reahing underneath he grabbed it&#39;s cock, kissing it unreservedly, fear from earlier in the day evaporated. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so-oo Sorry! I *sniff* wanted it to be you!&quot; James blubbered as he began showering the mottled cock in kisses. Now that his gambit hadn&#39;t worked, he realised, in it&#39;s failure, that he had wanted it to succeed. He wanted to be Dakota&#39;s. To have a secret donkey lover. To go home, look his parents in the eye, holding a cauldron of cum inside him. To smile at his sister, read books with her, while under his clothes he was painted in Dakota&#39;s cum. To spend an hour in front of a mirror, dressing up, putting on make-up, a nice dress, fixing his... her... hair, maybe a daisy crown to accentuate the horse ears; then to come out to the forset and be plowed like an animal.<br />
<br />
Eyes red and full of tears he could barely make out the hardened form of Dakota&#39;s cock. &quot;I cc-can do this for you a-at least&quot; James whimpered and he scooted into a seated position, legs splayed, under Dakota. <br />
<br />
Hungrily James noshed on the donkey cock. Licking, kissing, slurping. Playing with and drinking any pre-cum that oozed out. It became his world. He trailed the head around his black nipples, leaving a snails-trail of precum around them, looking like shiney eyes.<br />
<br />
He sighed in sadness as he returned to licking and sucking on the head, other hand trailing past his floppy horse cock to the battered pussy underneath. Gently he worked his fingers over it to coax it back to life, gently moaning into Dakota&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
His slick hands began to run along Dakota&#39;s shaft, gliding and trying to bring as much feeling to the donkey as he could. He owed Dakota that much, after failing to provide.<br />
<br />
A satisfied, excited *HHaaww* told James he was doing a good job. Which made the sadness disappate a little, allowing him to enjoy the moment. A fateful moment as he continued gently twirl his clit whith four fingers.<br />
<br />
The first James was made aware of his next change was a swelling feeling in his ass, specifically his asshole, feeling thick between his cheeks, almost pushing them apart. Not a moment later he noted that it was actually touching the cold forest floor.<br />
<br />
*Pop* he let go of Dakota&#39;s cock, pushing his own out of the way to investigate. What he saw made him yelp in joy, and he scrambled back onto all fours, babbling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! Oh yes! So Soon! This is the sign. I can be yours! I c-can! You can have me. Thank you... Thank you!&quot; He thanked whatever gods were in charge of this place as he presented his backside to Dakota again. This time with a long black leathery cleft, and matching doughnut asshole, winking and ready.<br />
<br />
This time, as James aligned the cock he felt his lips completely envelop Dakota&#39;s wide head; and as the donkey thrust, filling James&#39;s insides with a foot long donkey dick, James knew he had made the right choice. As he felt the donkey dick slowly and luxuriously pull out of him, pussy and insides aflame with ecstasy he knew that being fucked, was so much better that fucking. And as Dakota thrust again, James watched his flaccid horse cock flop all over the place, and he knew that he wouldn&#39;t need it much from now on.<br />
<br />
With a happy mewl he excitedly yelped. &quot;Fuck me Dakota. I&#39;m yours.&quot;</p>
