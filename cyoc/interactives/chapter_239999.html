<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time in a week, Zack getting back to school walked into school with a lightness in his step. His body was his again—no one else was pulling the strings, no one else was making decisions for him. No embarrassing comments, no weird behavior, and no ridiculous outfits. He felt free.<br />
<br />
Blake caught up with him in the hallway between classes, a shy but hopeful smile on his face. &quot;Hey, Zack,&quot; he said, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;About earlier... that kiss...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack felt a pang of embarrassment remembering the kiss, but then he surprised himself with how easily the words came. &quot;Yeah, about that... it was nice,&quot; Zack said, his cheeks turning pink as he stood still facing him. &quot;I mean... if you&#39;re cool with it, maybe we could... I don&#39;t know, try it again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake&#39;s face lit up with a grin. &quot;Yeah, I’d like that.&quot; He leaned in, and before Zack could overthink it, Blake gently pressed his lips to his again. This time, Zack kissed back, his heart pounding but not with fear. It felt... good. Right, even. For the first time in weeks, something in his life was normal—something he wanted, rather than something forced on him.<br />
<br />
The rest of the school day flew by. Zack felt lighter than ever, even looking forward to seeing Blake at lunch, where they shared a few more stolen kisses what turned into makingout. By the time school ended, Zack’s mood was so good he almost forgot about the mess waiting for him back home. Almost.<br />
<br />
Zack arrived at Molly’s middle school just as the bell rang. He spotted his mom—in Molly’s small, preteen body—sitting on a bench near the front gate, glaring at everything around her. Her arms were crossed, her glittery pink sneakers tapping against the pavement with impatience.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; Zack said cheerfully as he approached, enjoying the way his mom’s scowl deepened when she saw him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn’t funny, Zack,&quot; Maddie hissed, her high-pitched voice full of frustration. &quot;You need to swap us back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack shrugged, not even breaking stride as he started walking home. &quot;Yeah, that’s not happening right now. Come on, Sis, time to head home. Don’t want wast time here where you could be watching your favreat ticktokers and youtubers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack!&quot; Maddie protested, jogging after him. &quot;This is ridiculous! You can&#39;t just leave me like this! I’m your mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now, you’re not,&quot; Zack said, smirking as he walked. &quot;Right now, you’re my little sister, and I’ve gotta say, you’re doing a pretty good job of it. Maybe Molly was onto something with all the bratty behavior—kinda suits you, and... we will see if Molly is willing to give your body back when we get home.&quot; knowing she will well that is what he thinks anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack!&quot; Maddie whined, stomping her foot like a frustrated child. &quot;You’re being cruel! This isn’t right, and you know it! How would you feel if you were stuck in Molly’s body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already was stuck in someone else’s body—yours, remember? this morning with you not giving a crap what I felt. and didn’t seem too worried about what was right then.&quot; He grinned at her. &quot;Payback’s a bitch, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie groaned in frustration, but Zack ignored her protests, whistling as they walked the rest of the way home. Every time she tried to argue, he’d just shake his head and say, &quot;Not my problem.&quot; It felt amazing to finally turn the tables on her.<br />
<br />
When they got home, Zack tossed his bag on the couch and headed toward the stairs, his &quot;little sister&quot; trailing after him, still ranting about how unfair this was. But both of them froze when they heard something strange coming from upstairs—a series of muffled noises and rhythmic creaking.<br />
<br />
Zack and Maddie exchanged a look, and Zack’s stomach dropped. &quot;No way,&quot; he muttered, dashing up the stairs with Maddie right behind him. He reached his parents’ bedroom door, hesitated for a moment, then slowly pushed it open.<br />
<br />
What he saw made his jaw drop.<br />
<br />
There, on the bed, was Molly—in Maddie’s adult body—riding Jeffrey like her life depended on it. The room was filled with the sounds of their moans, and Molly’s expression was one of pure, unrestrained glee. She had clearly embraced her new role as the &quot;mom&quot; of the house and was making the most of her time with Jeffrey.<br />
<br />
Zack slammed the door shut immediately, his face bright red. Maddie, still in Molly’s small body, stood there frozen, her mouth hanging open in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Zack said after a moment, recovering enough to speak. He turned to Maddie with a sly grin. &quot;Looks like Molly’s pretty happy being you. Guess that means you’re stuck as her for a little while longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie’s eyes widened in horror. &quot;Zack, no! You can’t leave me like this! Swap us back right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack shrugged, his grin growing wider. &quot;Sorry, but I don’t think Molly’s gonna want to switch back anytime soon. And honestly, after seeing that? I don’t blame her.&quot; He let out a laugh. &quot;You really don’t have any options here, Sis. I mean, unless you want to jump into Dad and see what that’s like.&quot; He snorted. &quot;Go ahead, I dare you, im sure Molly will give you a good time as your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie’s face turned bright red, a mix of anger and embarrassment. &quot;You’re awful,&quot; she muttered, her small fists clenched at her sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I’m just giving you a taste of your own medicine,&quot; Zack said, ruffling her hair. &quot;Now, go do your homework. I’ll check it later.&quot; He laughed at the look of pure rage on her face and headed to his room, leaving Maddie standing there fuming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack!&quot; she shouted after him. &quot;You can’t just leave me like this! Zack!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Zack was already in his room, locking the door behind him. For the first time in what felt like forever, he felt completely in control of his life. And it felt amazing.</p>
