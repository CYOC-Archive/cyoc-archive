<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew felt eager to have a real sex experience without even losing his virginity so he decided to try fucking a guy. Andrew wasn’t sure if it was his new form making the decision for him but he decided that sex was still sex. Andrew held up his new larger hand as he selected a new experience before feeling himself shoot through the white void again as he headed toward the fantasy.<br />
<br />
As Andrew headed to his new destination, he was surprised to see that his body was being altered again. “Wait! I picked the option to have sex with this body” Andrew said as he felt himself beginning to change. Andrew was sure that he had made the decision to fuck another guy with his new body. “You chose the option to be fucked BY this body” the voice said.<br />
<br />
Andrew now aware of his mistake tried to do something but realized it was futile as he was now being transformed.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt himself growing smaller as he lost height to the point he was even smaller than his original 16 year old self standing at five feet even. Then Andrew gaped as his new muscles lost definition leaving his limbs slender and thin as his body hair receded only leaving a small amount over his dick and a small dusting on his arms and legs. Andrew groaned as his new dick shrunk to a mere three inches as his balls shrunk to match his new smaller equipment. All of Andrew’s impressive features seemed to have been reversed as Andrew kept transforming. As Andrew finished he realized he had turned into a scrawny thin short young man. In fact he felt he would best be described looking like a twink.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Andrew wondered as everything went white and the fantasy started. Andrew appeared laying on a bed and looked down unaware of the changes like before everything just felt different. Suddenly he heard some footsteps as a person appeared.<br />
<br />
It was him.<br />
<br />
Or more like the previous version of Andrew. The muscular jock that Andrew had previously looked like was now walking over toward Andrew and grinned down at Andrew. Wearing a dominant expression, Andrew felt himself becoming very submissive as his whole body began to tingle. “How’s my little cumdump today?” The other Andrew said in a deep masculine voice.<br />
<br />
Andrew wanted to yell out loud to stop the fantasy but realized that he was locked in place. It was as if everything had already been re-recorded and Andrew’s conscious was only placed in the recording unable to interfere. “G-g-great” Andrew responded noticing how high pitched his voice now sounded. <br />
<br />
Like before Andrew felt as if he was unable to do anything that wasn’t already determined for him. He saw his other self climb on to the bed and tower over him as his cock swung out erect at an impressive length. “Was it really that big?” Andrew thought trying to remember how big it felt when he had it.<br />
<br />
Andrew looked down to see him small cock begin to erect as he felt the other Andrew grabs his legs and pull them apart. “What a slutty hole, already sucking me in” the other Andrew said as he placed his large cock near Andrew’s hole. Andrew could feels his asshole quiver from excitement as the tip placed near his entrance. Andrew tried to tell the other Andrew to stop.<br />
<br />
Instead he said, “Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.”<br />
Andrew almost felt embarrassed at how submissive he felt but he also felt an inward sense of pleasure he refused to admit. Suddenly the other Andrew thrust his cock inside and Andrew moaned as he felt himself being inserted. Hitting the rim, Andrew almost cummed as the new sensation registered in his body.<br />
<br />
Soon the other Andrew was firmly holding Andrew as he began to thrust and pound Andrew aggressively. Andrew wanted to plead desperately for him to stop but he only moaned and shouted “Harder” instead. As Andrew began to be fucked out of his mind he could only view the situation downward, watching his pathetic penis dangle as the heavy vibrations from the other Andrew powerful thrusts made his body move.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt himself slowing losing himself as he began to enjoy the new pleasure of bottoming. Forgetting almost who he was before, Andrew moaned as he was fucked rapidly before feeling a warm sensation in his ass. The other Andrew let out a manly groan as Andrew realized he had finished inside of him. Instead of feeling disgust, this was the breaking point for Andrew as he enjoyed the warm fluid inside him to the point he came all over himself.<br />
<br />
Finally everything went white as Andrew was sent back to the void.</p>
