<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking down, he noticed that his diaper went from being dry to warm. Jonathan must have used his diaper when he was asleep.<br />
<br />
Jonathan tried to get up from his father’s lap, but the way he was laying down requires him to do a sit-up, something he currently couldn’t do.<br />
<br />
“Looks like someone’s awake! You want down?” His father asked. Jonathan nodded his head and he was lifted off of his father’s lap. He was about to reach the ground, but he was suspended in air. <br />
<br />
“Looks like someone made another stinky!” His father held Jonathan close to his chest as he cradled him all the way to Jonathan’s room.<br />
<br />
From there, Jonathan received another diaper change. He didn’t mind this one since his father wasn’t talking about dick sizes.<br />
<br />
When his change was finished, Jonathan’s father gave him a raspberry on his stomach, making the tot laugh.<br />
<br />
“Stay right here for paw paw, ok?” His dad left the room with the dirty diaper. Jonathan knew they didn’t have anywhere good to put diapers, so his dad was probably putting them in the trash outside.<br />
<br />
As his dad was outside, Jonathan searched his room again for any possible hints about the lotion. Sadly, nothing could be found. <br />
<br />
A few minutes had past and Jonathan expected his father to return by now. He opened his door and saw the attic opened with the ladder stretched down.<br />
<br />
He could hear someone shuffling through boxes up in the attic. As curious as he currently was, Jonathan climbed up the ladder and looked inside.<br />
<br />
The attic contained many things of everyone. It had memories of both his mom and dad when they were kids. Any photos, trophies, and things that had meaning were up in the attic. Jonathan and George had everything of theirs in the attic. Old clothes, toys, costumes, awards. If either of them didn’t want it in their room, it went to the attic.<br />
<br />
Jonathan was quickly scooped up before he could climb into the attic.<br />
<br />
“I told you to stay put in the room mister! Little boys can’t climb that ladder yet!” His father yelled. His father wasn’t usually mad at him, only when he did something that could have hurt him. Jonathan knew that when he was yelled at, it meant his father got worried. But it had been a while since he was yelled at, so he wasn’t expecting it.<br />
<br />
“I-“ Jonathan remembered that he was 2, not 18. So he wouldn’t know proper grammar. “Sorry” he corrected himself.<br />
<br />
“Well don’t do it again. Ask someone else to help you up!” His dad said. He let Jonathan down on his feet and showed him boxes labeled “baby”<br />
<br />
His dad sat crisscross and Jonathan copied him. He showed him his “father’s” pictures of when Jonathan was a baby. Some where extremely embarrassing that Jonathan wouldn’t dare show a kid.<br />
<br />
“And here’s your daddy learning to go potty. He was a very stinky baby, just like you.” The picture he held was of Jonathan on the toilet when he was 4. He was a late bloomer on the potty training system, and still wet the bed when he graduated kindergarten.<br />
<br />
“Look at this! When your uncle George was a baby, Jonathan got jealous and acted like a baby too. It didn’t last long since he was told to wear a diaper.<br />
<br />
“Please stop! I don’t want anyone to know these photos exist!” Jonathan thought.<br />
<br />
His father showed more photos, each reaching deep in Jonathan’s embarrassment. After a few dozen of photos, his father grabbed another box. This box was labeled “baby clothes”<br />
<br />
“We can’t take you to the store wearing just a diaper, your little tooshie will fall off. So, we are going to let you wear some of your daddy’s old clothes” his father said.<br />
<br />
Digging in, his father picked out clothes that were both the right size and the right season. He dressed Jonathan up right there in the attic.<br />
<br />
He went from wearing just a diaper to wearing clothes. A long sleeve camouflage shirt, overalls, and baby socks and boots. If he remembered well, Jonathan could have sword the outfit he had on is what he’d wear when he went fishing with his dad. Looking behind him, he could see two buttons on his butt. They were probably for diaper checks.<br />
<br />
“Look at you! Just like your daddy! If only he didn’t run off on you!” He picked up Jonathan and carried him down the ladder and then the stairs. His mother was in the kitchen cleaning up.<br />
<br />
“Aw look at you two. He looks just like Jonathan when he was little!” She said. She walked over and pinched Jonathan’s cheeks. He smiled and was turned around to face his father.<br />
<br />
“You know, he does look a lot like him.” Jonathan was beginning to feel nervous. Could his parents actually figure out his identity?</p>
