<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I wish Brad was less annoying,” Izzy grumbled before thrusting that dildo into her body. In all honesty it was just awkward, weird and kind of painful. It didn’t arouse her that much and she ended up just pulling it out in an awkward manner. A blush spread across her face, more from the fact she’d tried to masturbate than any sort of pleasure. But that small thrust had done something. It had taken something from her mind and transmitted it. A change in reality occurred but it didn’t affect Izzy at all. Instead it flowed outwards into Brad’s room where he was bouncing a rubber ball against the wall separating him and Veronica to see how long it would take for his sister to get annoyed. It was then that he suddenly shuddered and had the ball bounce back and hit him in the forehead.<br />
<br />
Veronica’s thoughts of annoyance were drawn upon, Candice’s thoughts were drawn upon, Zossie’s thoughts were drawn upon, and even his parents had their annoyed thoughts brought up. Classmates, teachers, random people at the supermarket, and other kids in the boy scouts all had their grievances combined, mashed around, and eventually drilled into Brad’s head. His mouth went wide as his brain went blank and suddenly he fell backwards onto the bed covered in sweat. His body began to ripple and shrink becoming slightly smaller but retaining a general size. His arms and legs slimmed down and his body took on a slightly more curvy shape. His eyes shut and opened several times becoming bigger and prettier and his face cleaned up and he began to resemble his sisters more. The nose shrank, the shoulders smoothed out, and the hair on his head sprouted outwards and down in long tresses that fell to his shoulders. It became wavy and full while his teeth straightened out and braces emerged on them shiny and silver. Any chance of loudly chomping on an apple in the lunch room or leaving a trail of popcorn vanished entirely. His body reshaped so that he was in the early stages of female puberty. Absolutely minuscule breasts emerged on his chest along with a training bra and below his penis sucked inwards and turned into a female vagina. Her legs reshaped themselves and suddenly Bradley was a girl who looked a lot like her sisters, albeit taller and skinnier than any of them. She now didnt trail a bunch of boys around the front yards on weekends and throw basketballs around denting Veronica’s car, her teacher’s preference for female students came into play as she lost that need for attention as the only boy in an all girl family. She got quieter and quieter as classmate’s grievances weighed in. She got shyer and shyer as his preference for dominating conversations was overwritten by classmates and people in public who just wanted the loud boy to shut up in movie theatres. These same people’s wishes made her socially awkward beyond all reason and her voice became super quiet and soft. She was nervous and hated making a show of herself and having attention on her.<br />
<br />
Librarians who just wanted her to shut up and read got their wish as her messy room organized itself and sports equipment turned into fantasy novels. She began to lose memories of weekends spent in a horde of neighbourhood boys chasing dogs on bikes and shouting while running down the street. Now those same boys scared her when they came running by and her memories of friends adjusted. Cassidy Blanche, a girl she had teased and poked fun at for years about her shyness was suddenly her best friend and memories of getting in her face and making her stutter and blush were replaced by lunchtime conversations.<br />
<br />
Her parents got their wish and she was now an easy baby to care for, a toddler who never made a fuss, a child who never threw tantrums, and a teen without any traces of rebellion in her. All her sisters suddenly lost annoyed moments of anger directed at her that were replaced by pleasant conversations. She was their quiet and polite sister who preferred to sit alone and make little noise than draw any attention. She was Haley, a student who blushed when teachers called on her and began to stutter, a girl who knew about every popular fiction book on the market but never talked about it for fear of her classmates calling her weird. She was a girl who silently did the dishes after dinner and random chores for her mother instead of making a mess. She was a girl who listened to classical piano instrumentals instead of loud rap and rock. She was a girl who could play the violin expertly and practiced in the shed so she didn’t disturb anyone. She was a straight A student who her teachers wanted to come out of her shell. And she was a girl who had more patches than anyone at her scout camp but never bragged and got flustered whenever pressed to help someone. She was Haley now and Bradley was all but forgotten as her room changed.<br />
<br />
Sports equipment and prank supplies morphed into books, clothing became clean and clear of scuffs and tears, and the mess began to tidy itself up. Posters melted into nothingness and were replaced by small cacti on the windowsill and even more books. Shelves constructed themselves and got lined with the things while her desk cleaned itself up and became neat and tidy. Her clothes all shifted into hand me down T-shirts and jeans that gave her a frumpy look and sweaters that were all two sizes too large. None of it fit her shoulders right and she constantly looked like she was wearing boys clothes due to it. Her own clothes matched this description as she became clean and rose to her feet. Her toes hit the ground but she walked so silently she could have been a ninja. Her soft steps removed stains off the carpet, caused books to fly into shelves and let her bed restructure itself with soft pillows and a comfortable spread made of old blankets her sisters had used that Brad had declined due to their colouration. Her hands robotically clutched a novel floating in mid air and as the room settled into its new existence and Veronica’s marks improved next door thanks to her ability to study, Haley sat down on the bed again and turned. She splayed out and got comfortable before rolling from left to right and eventually sliding off the edge of the bed with only her feet on the comfortable portion and her back on the floor. Her hair lay around her in a mess and her hands stretched upwards rifling through the book to the blank page 362 and stopping. Words filled the page and her legs began to beat the bedsheets. She blinked to life and began to read the adventure. Haley’s newly formed mind became so engrossed she wasn’t even aware of how she was sitting, the movement of her legs making the slightest bit of noise, and her recent transformation. She was so engrossed that at the moment she wasn’t even aware of her own existence. She just continued to read “Beyond this Earthly Realm” with a content smile on her face like she always grew when she was reading. She’d move around a little from time to time but remained silently dreaming up what she was reading until she was called for dinner. Then she shut the book without a sound, drew herself up with minimal noise, and descended the stairs still picturing what had passed over her eyes with a happy smile.</p>
