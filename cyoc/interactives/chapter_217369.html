<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yeah, Peter is still concerned he may shrink even though the chances are very low because of the vaccine he got. Some friends told him that if he becomes tiny after all, having already a tiny guy as a pet won’t help as they may also both end up in the pet shop. But he decides to go shopping to his local shrunken humans pet shop.<br />
<br />
He arrives early and the store doors are still locked. Several other potential clients gathered near the entrance awaiting the opening time. Peter feels a little uncomfortable as even though it’s legal to own a shrunken person,  there are still several controversies because many tiny persons are pretty young. He still remembers when one of his cousins, Alex, shrink when he was only 10 years old and was bought by a 45 years old man. No one heard about tiny Alex since then.<br />
<br />
Finally, a clerk unlocks the door, so everyone gets inside, browsing the various selling displays. Tiny people are sorted by age, gender, couple, single, body shape, and ethnicity. Most males just wear compression square-cut underwear. Females have some kind of bikini. Peter is not sure if he wants a female, a male or a couple. Most are quite expensive, but he saved enough money to get and expensive one, or two at lower price. <br />
<br />
He cannot resist discretely observing how the other customers behave during their shopping. He sees a middle age woman, maybe a lesbian, who is very interested in shrunken women. She seems to be a regular client of the shop. Peter hopes that all she bought are still alive and healthy. But Why does she need so many of them? Tiny humans are such high maintenance.<br />
<br />
Then, his attention is attracted to the young and teen boys section. A man around 50 years old asks a clerk if he can have a closer look at a few boys. Peter knows the man, he was his gym teacher when he was 13 years old. He is a very massive guy, very muscled but well-defined, and quite hairy too. He remembers when he made the class of boys does seats-ups, roaming the gym class, looking down at all the boys, almost towering over them.  Our 18 years old boy also remembers some weird stories about him having tiny guys, so it seems it was a fact as he is at the shop to obviously purchase one or more.  The sales clerk unlocks and opens the glass lid and tells the man he may hold only one at a time. Peter walks toward there as he seriously thinks that a boy may be a nice pet too. The man shoves his hand inside the display unit, a tiny young boy around 10 years old who tries to avoid being taken, but the man doesn’t mind and grabs him by his mid-section and lifts him closer to his face. The poor boy squirms, cries, and yells, begging the man to leave him alone. “hum... Too skinny”, the man said, so he put him back where he took him from.  Suddenly, a tiny boy around 14 years old who has a swimmer body is standing up, looking up at the man. He wears white square-cut underwear, he have his legs slightly spread. Peter recognizes him, it’s Martin, he used to live in the house next to his home. He didn’t know he have shrunk at all, so he feels sorry for him. But it seems the tiny boy doesn’t seem t mind so much about it. <br />
<br />
(Martin) Hey, Sir, down here! Don’t you want me?<br />
<br />
Peter pays a little more attention to the tiny guy’s bulge, he definitively has a boner, very aroused by the 50 years old man. The man smiles at him in a very weird way, difficult to describe. In a heartbeat, the man grabs the tiny teen guy, lifting him, I can see he is rubbing the teen’s bulge with his thumb and says: “Oh very nice!”<br />
<br />
The sales clerk seeing it, immediately intervene.<br />
<br />
(sales clerk) Oh... Sorry, Sir, you know our politic here, {You touch a shrunken human’s genitals, you buy him!}<br />
<br />
The man knew about it, smiles, and agreed to that term. He walks to the cashier, buys the tiny teen and he leaves. Then, the tiny young boy around 10 years old who didn’t want to be taken by the middle age man, jumps up and down several times, crying to me: “Please, touch my pee pee, I want you to buy me!”<br />
<br />
(Peter) Hey cutie boy, I don’t have to touch your pee pee to buy you. It’s okay, I will buy you and take care of you.<br />
<br />
The tiny boy weeps with joy and relief as Peter makes arrangement to reserve the tiny kid with a sales clerk, he then has been put in a box filled with cotton balls, and carried near the cashiers in waiting the nice teen boy have finished his shopping.<br />
<br />
Peter also wishes to also purchase a tiny man who shrunk during the time he was jailed for a minor crime. Yeah, the shrinking virus strikes there too, and it’s very common. The prison guards have to watch every imprisoned guys in case of shrinking, because others may pick them up and do horrible things with them.  A sales clerk walks him to that particular section to show him the only one left, as all the other one has been sold very fast. Actually, when the other tiny men has been bought, that tiny man was back-store for being washed because he was covered by dirt when he arrived. Anyway, he slept in the left rear corner of the wall of the glass sales display. Peter was fascinated to see his little belly huffing and puffing as he breathed. His tiny body was quite impressive, maybe because prisoners do lots of bodybuilding. The fascinated teen asks why he has been imprisoned. He’s been told that it was a minor offence for stealing electronics at first. But when he got caught, he tried to resist the policemen. It’s kind of sad because the man just badly needed more money to provide for his young son.  Yeah, the tiny man was a single dad before he shrunk. Looking closer, Peter recognized him, gee it was the day to see people he already knew.  It was definitively his uncle Denis. Man, his dad told him he simply left for business travel and it was his sister who had to watch over his son while he was gone. Looks like the secret of the criminal event for providing for his son has been cloaked...<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Peter has good memories of his uncle Denis. He is so much more muscled than the last time he saw him at a holiday relative’s party a few years ago. But now he is tiny and incredibly nice to watch.  That uncle was very cool, he is from his dad’s side of the family. He is so hot to watch, muscled, hairy, half-naked, and asleep. <br />
<br />
(Peter) No mistake Mr salesman, I want that one.<br />
<br />
(salesman) Are you sure about it, he is not cheap as he is a bulked muscled guy with a nice endowment.<br />
<br />
The hot tiny man, Denis, woke up as he heard talking. Still lying on his back, he looked up and saw that good-looking teen talking with the salesman. He was not so into being sold and taken by anyone, very worried about his son he didn’t see since he has been jailed and later shrunk. Peter noticed he was awake,<br />
<br />
(Peter) Oh hello, tiny Uncle Denis! Glad to see you, but sorry about your shrinking.<br />
<br />
Tiny Denis was very embarrassed to see one of his young relatives looking down at him in his shrunken condition. Nevertheless, it was the first time he saw some “family” in a very long. <br />
<br />
(Denis) Likewise, my nephew looks like you turned out to be a very good-looking lad, good for you!<br />
<br />
Peter could no resist staring at his shrunken uncle&#39;s body, he felt a bit guilty as he began to be very aroused by that view of a perfectly developed mature man’s body. He needs to buy him before somebody else does.<br />
<br />
(Peter) Mr salesman, I definitively want him.<br />
<br />
Denis was a bit uncomfortable that an 18 years old boy was about to buy him, even worst, he was a close relative. But on second thought, he was relief that the boy may not be rough with him.  Peter picked him up gently and carried him to the cashier where the other boy he reserved inside the box was waiting for him. Both shrunken guys costed a lot, but Peter thought it worth every penny. Yeah, tiny uncle Denis also has been put in a boy with cotton balls.<br />
<br />
The way back home was not so long. Inside his place, Peter opened the two boxes. He was already prepared to welcome tiny persons. He has built a tiny house to make his new tiny flatmates comfortable. </p>
