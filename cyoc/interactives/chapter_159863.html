<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was still in the basement when he woke up. He felt crummy, crusty, and overall disgusting. Recalling the night before, Mark remembered that he was blasted with Dave’s little sister’s cock juice.<br />
<br />
“Ewgh, gotta go shower now,” he said as he got up from the cold basement floor. He made his way up the basement stairs. Once at the top, Mark gave a quick scan of his surroundings to find that the party was over and that it was morning. There was the after party mess, but no Dave, Jane, or anyone else. Mark just wanted to shower so he made his way up the second story stairs towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Moving past Jane’s room, he heard feminine moaning noises, and not learning his lesson of peaking in on people, Mark snuck a look. Inside he saw his assailant of the night before mastubating on her bed with her tree-like trunk. It was bizarre and unbelievable to Mark even though he saw it the night before.  <br />
<br />
Jane was holding two round jiggly things in both hands, sandwiching her cock of cock as best she could, rubbing up and down slowly. With a few more seconds of observation, it turned out that the jiggly things were the living boobs that used to be guys, the ones Dave told him about. She must have stolen them from his room. Holy guacamole! There was something sticking in her dick hole, it must have been the guy turned penis. After seeing this Mark turned to leave, urethral penetration and sounding was too much for him. Plus the penis and boobs used to be people, but Jane was using them as sex toys, and that felt wrong. Dave really had a kinky sister.<br />
<br />
Mark bolted towards the restroom eager to get clean, and trying to forget the sight he just saw. Opening the bathroom door, he was greeted with the sight of a beautiful wet angel. Water glistened on her smooth clear skin as the flow of liquid highlighted her back’s curve down to her wide hips and rounded bottom. Her thicc thighs looked so soft, and her thin waist was made for hugging. Her chest, while flat as a cutting board, only highlighted her other generous assets. Following her back length bright blonde hair up, silky and glimmering even while wet, Mark saw intense sky blue eyes with long luscious lashes kissed by the sun. Then he saw pink lips softer than clouds open up screaming, “Mark dude! Get the fuck out of here! You sick pervert!” Even her voice was of an angel, cute even while angry as hell. <br />
<br />
With cheeks turning red, which only made her more precious, she opened the glass door of the shower and threw a slugger. The bar of soap smacked Mark in between his eyes so hard that he stumbled out of the bathroom. Coming to his senses, he closed the bathroom door with a slam.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry Dave!” he yelled in panic.<br />
Oh jeez febreeze, that heavenly girl was Dave, how could he have forgotten that? Nugget in a sandwich, damn donuts, Jane’s mind destroying monster meat, how could Dave be his dream girl? Why was he ogling his best friend like some horny idiot? He needed to find this Chronivac thingamajig and turn Dave back to normal before he falls in love with the blonde cutie. Mark left the bathroom door to walk back down the stairs. He needed to find a drink if there was anything left after the party.<br />
<br />
An hour later Mark, Dave, and Jane were cleaning the house together. Dave had gotten out of the shower half an hour before, and coldly told Mark that it was free. Once Jane was finished beating her meat and Mark out of the shower, Dave forced them both to help clean up the home. <br />
<br />
“You are a horrible sister, you transformed me and random people for kicks, and then let this Cindy steal the Chronivac from you?” Dave asked as she threw another red plastic cup into a garbage bag.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I did it for a good cause those guys were stealing our t.v., and I think you look super duper cute as a girl,” Jane wiped a table with a cloth merrily.<br />
<br />
“But you let her steal the Chronivac,” Dave said again.<br />
<br />
“In my defense, Cindy was super skilled with her mouth.”<br />
<br />
“In words or other things?” Mark asked with interest, he was vacuuming the couch with a hand vacuum at the moment.<br />
<br />
“Eh, both.”<br />
<br />
“Damn it Mark, I’m scolding my sister right now. Plus, I haven’t forgiven you for that stunt you pulled.”<br />
<br />
“I said I was sorry!”<br />
<br />
“Humpf,” giving Mark the cold shoulder, Dave returned to questioning her sister, “Do you know where Cindy lives?”<br />
<br />
“Uh no, gotta ask around at school for that information.”<br />
<br />
“Well once we do know where she lives we could take it back,” Dave said bitterly, “or we could just take it from her at school.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think stealing it from her at school is a good idea, ‘cause Cindy has a ton of followers,” Jane moved on to wiping a stain off a wall.<br />
<br />
Mark watched as the siblings discussed what they were going to do. Even the most mundane of tasks were made extraordinary enthralling when beautiful women did them. Dave was shorter than his sister, but he had wider hips which complimented his rounded bottom and thicc thighs. Every time she bent down to pick up a red plastic cup, Mark couldn&#39;t resist a quick glance at the blonde’s short short covered booty, or her squishable thighs in tight stockings. <br />
<br />
Jane looked like the older of the siblings now. She was taller, had honey blonde hair that was also back length, and had nice tits that filled out her shirt in a way that everyone could appreciate. Her butt was smaller than Dave’s but it was still large. She had curves of girls older than her age, and in all very sexy. It seemed that the beauty gene ran in the family. The rocket in her pocket, her long gun, her sword of swords, the biggest dick in the world was the only thing that was distracting from Jane’s natural beauty. That is not to say that the cum hose was ugly, in fact it had a hypnotic sort of beauty like seeing a blood moon, it was just different from normal. The way it bulged obscenely from her shorts, under her, and between her breasts only brought erotic thoughts to Mark’s mind. Yup, the only way to comfortably hide the weapon was to have it rest in an upright position between her boobs because Jane’s massive family jewels took up all the space in her shorts.<br />
<br />
“Ok Mark, you heard all of that?” Dave asked with her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
“Uh, shit, could you run that by me again?”<br />
<br />
“MArk YoU wEre STARING AT US, weren’t YOU!” Dave furiously shot eye daggers into Mark’s heart, whether that was a good thing or not was up to debate.  <br />
<br />
“Oh chill out Dave, it’s not his fault that my schlong is the most attractive thing in this room. Bro if you haven’t noticed, you’re so cute and huggable. You know what come here,” Jane dropped her rag and spray bottle and glomped Dave into a hug that restrained the furious valkyrie from attacking poor Mark.<br />
<br />
“Eegewa! Get your dick out of my face!” Dave said as she held her head away from Jane’s breasts and dick head.<br />
<br />
And so the day went on, the three friends cleaned the house while joking around in an awkward acceptance of their new, and hopeful temporary, normal.</p>
