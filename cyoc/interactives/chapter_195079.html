<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Immediately after entering his room Ethan virtually took everything off and stood himself in front of a full length mirror. The events of today proved one thing, and that was that he took quite a bit for granted. He never realized just how much his physical appearance actually allowed him the privilege of living with a nonchalant attitude. Society often frowned upon those who indulge in vanity, perhaps that was the reason why he never really took a good look at himself, to really appreciate all that he had going for him.<br />
<br />
“I want to see myself”.<br />
<br />
Taking in his visage in its entirety, Ethan made an effort to savor the moment as he slowly scanned his way down.<br />
<br />
He had dark brown curly hair in a slightly overgrown crew-cut, it was always either kept like a forest of curls like today or combed down parted with gel to the left. Ethan liked to keep the top a bit on the longer side to cover up a light colored scar that peeks over the left side of his hairline; a souvenir from his father during one of his many drunken outbursts. Most people would probably not notice such a small detail, but to him it stood out stark against his tan olive skin.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… so maybe I am a little vainer than I originally thought?” Ethan remarked briefly and moved on.<br />
<br />
Pointed ears subtly elevated thick eyebrows, that when relaxed, lacked much of an arch to them; they hover above dark brown downturned eyes. Ethan noted that the combination possibly gave him quite a steely yet sleek vibe.<br />
<br />
He points his chin to one side and noted the convex curve to the profile of his nose, he recalls contemplating possibly having it straightened one day as it strongly reminds him of the woman who abandoned her children, she too had such a nose, although Ethan couldn’t lie to himself it did make him look regal.<br />
<br />
His upper lip was thinner than the bottom and occasionally a dimple would appear on his left cheek- just one. All these features were contained within a rectangular face shape. He let fingers travel down his neck and started counting one, two, three, moles are visible just below his Adam’s apple; if one were to trace them, they would form a triangle.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… you’re a looker alright” Ethan said to his reflection, matter-of-factly.<br />
<br />
Averting from the mirror for a moment, Ethan searched around his room until he found his toolbox and from it, he procured a measuring tape. As he held it, a light bulb went off in his head.<br />
<br />
The boys on the team did a lot of locker room talk and the most prominent topics of discussion were sex and generally weird shit. Ethan was not nearly quite as adventurous as some of the highlights of those discussions when it came to pleasing himself. He had always kept it pretty basic, just stroke n go. The only weird part about his sessions was that it was often, if not always, done because some curious soul wanted to see him do it and what can he say? He’s a people pleaser.<br />
<br />
Ethan smiled to himself, for the first time HE was the requestor and the thing he was planning to do with the tape might be considered within the realm of marginally weird… and it’d definitely be embarrassing if people saw him do it.<br />
<br />
He’d taken physicals before, but he was often bored out of his mind while medical professionals took his measurements, it was just something to get over with so he never really paid any attention to his stats and anyone could see from a mile away that he had a pretty decent built for swimming.<br />
<br />
Now however, he wanted to know the specifics, he wanted to know how he’d measure up against other folks. Jared teases Greg all the time about how he falls short down under, compared to his peers, but outside the swim team, Greg was fine. Compared to Ethan this afternoon… Greg was the clear winner.<br />
<br />
Ethan went back to stand in front of the mirror, Coach made the team memorize so much useless shit, but now he was glad to be able to use some of that knowledge.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked to his shoulders measuring 24 inches. That’s 4 inches longer than Tom Daley.<br />
<br />
“I…get the gold on shoulders…” Ethan said aloud awkwardly. He admits to himself that felt cringe but shook it off, this is what he wanted to try.<br />
<br />
Ethan let the tip of the measuring tape slide down to his nipples, the areolas brown and each about the size of a half dollar coin, Ethan crossed his hands and circled the nipples erect with his index fingers. He lived 17 years of his life without once playing with his nipples until now, he brought one index finger to his lips and sensually puts it in his mouth making it wet with his saliva, while leaving the other one dry, rubbing them again just for comparison.<br />
<br />
The circumference of his chest measured 44 inches. Ethan pulled the tape measure around his chest off quickly so that they would scrap against his hard nipples and it made them tingle. Michael Phelps’ had a 46 inch chest, then again Phelps was a freak-of-nature Ethan thought to himself and wondered further, how much more of one HE was this morning, for ‘smaller’ reasons. He felt the stirring growing stronger in his crotch he was getting a semi but ignored it for now. Ethan wanted to explore all of his body and not just the main course.<br />
<br />
His biceps were 14 inches “Almost” Ethan whispered “But Evgeny Rylov has an inch over you” his pectorals pulsated and arm muscles tensed and flexed as he did a few basic bodybuilder poses. Ethan gifted each bicep a kiss “Rest while you can, I’m gonna torture you with curls and ring dips”.<br />
<br />
He turned around so that his back would be reflected and did a rear lat spread. Ethan turned his head back to face the mirror and admire his tight glutes “Lookin’ good!” He winked at his reflection. The tape around his waist came to 31 inches and he let it shimmy down, shaking his ass as it did, to measure his hips. “33 inches” Ethan trembled as the tape brushed against his patient cock, “Not yet buddy” He told it.<br />
<br />
Ethan bent over forwards onto the foot of the bed and watched his dangly lemon sized testicles and monster meat sway back and forth, like a pendulum, as he wiggled his ass in the air. Laying his palms just underneath his shoulder blades, Ethan inhaled and exhaled slowly as he made his hands smooth down towards his lumbar and then over his buttocks. He dug his fingernails into them greedily and spread those cheeks exposing, funnily enough, two more beauty marks and a brown hairy wrinkly hole that faintly promised a pink haven the more he pulled his butt cheeks apart.<br />
<br />
“If the team could see me now…” he exclaimed, “Try clogging this filtration system guys!” Ethan, feeling more comfortable, stopped caring how corny his dirty talk was. He never put anything up there before, on no account had he ever even considered himself gay and looking back, he never really thought of women much either. Ethan had been too busy keeping his grades up, improving his freestyle, butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke, aiming for scholarships, too busy with part-time jobs, keeping his dad in check and making sure Eric was cared for. This display was solely for him, not anyone else, this was his self-discovery and it was liberating.<br />
<br />
Ethan wrapped the measuring tape around his thigh, pinched the mark and let it go as his hands smoothed over them, “These gorgeous babes are 19 inches!” He turned around giggling, shuffling to sit on the floor and rest his back against the footboard of the bed.<br />
<br />
Ethan fixated on the mirror, the absolute stud looking back was a sweaty mess with now frizzy hair and red marks on the sides of his hips and across his chest. He stared at the expression of the man in the mirror’s face for a little while longer before watching him spread his legs apart. The man reached out for the main event but paused mid-way, choosing instead to stretch out his feet and wriggle his toes, Ethan called the man a tease before replying “size 14…” the man shook his head and chuckled.<br />
<br />
Daley, Rylov, not even Phelps filled out their Speedos as much as the Adonis within the mirror. ‘He gets all the medals’ Ethan mused, that guy over there is ‘The Man’.<br />
<br />
“That’s a big cock you got there…impressive, fucking colossal really. Mine’s tiny as fuck…” Ethan got quiet for a moment. The longer no one spoke, the louder the silence became.<br />
<br />
He was alone…WITH ‘The Man’, Ethan started to pant, his hands shaking in anticipation ‘Just… go with it’ He thought as he bit his lip and started a new fantasy.<br />
<br />
He was the Ethan of this morning and he finally got ‘caught’.<br />
<br />
“Aw man… Ha…please don’t tell anyone about this I…” Ethan’s eyes darted to The Man’s crotch and The Man formed the most mischievous grin. “My reputation… I’ll be ruined” He continued with an ever increasing heart rate “Yeah, I stuff my pants my… my dick hides sometimes, sometimes I forget if I ever had one”.<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful cock, even in it’s flaccid state it looked majestic “God you’re so big” Ethan whispered, reiterating some of the words certain curious people had said to him “If I had a dick like that… how big even is it?” Yes, this is how it usually begins.<br />
<br />
Ethan took hold of the measuring tape once more, looking into the eyes of The Man in the mirror as if asking for permission. The Man nodded.<br />
<br />
Ethan kept his gaze locked with him, as he gently held the soft penis. Ethan used a thumb to gingerly smooth the tape across the length of it and showed him the mark.<br />
<br />
“6 inches long” Jaw dropping.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s face was getting more heated and his mind was racing with gratitude, how lucky was he to be in the presence of such a fine specimen? Ethan used the back of his hand to lift the penis away from The Man’s sweaty scrotum, concerned that wrapping it around his fingers carelessly might be ‘disrespectful’ somehow. He carefully wraps the tape around the hefty girth.<br />
<br />
“5 inches wide oh my god…” Ethan gasped.<br />
<br />
His head was spinning, would he ever get a chance like this again? Ethan cleared his throat because it suddenly felt dry “Please may I?”<br />
<br />
‘Yes’<br />
<br />
Ethan gulps, he licks his lips… here goes nothing! He scoots down into the floor a bit further and lifts his legs upwards into the air, letting his arms fold between his gorgeous thighs. Ethan used his right hand to lift the penis up closer to his face, it was okay this time The Man gave him permission. Ethan then proceeded to lean forward and bend down, to plant a gentle kiss on the tip.<br />
<br />
Ethan rests a cheek against the soft penis and slides it across to the other; closing his eyes, he begins to inhale, its scent tickling his nostrils. He did it again, rub sniff, rub and sniff, like a cat to catnip.<br />
<br />
Ethan raised his head up to face The Man again, a desperate plea engulfs Ethan’s face, but The Man however looked authoritative, how that was possible, Ethan did not question it, except he only waited for an answer and The Man gave him that mischievous grin again signaling agreement.<br />
<br />
Ethan pressed his lips against the tip of The Man’s penis and carefully suckled it into his mouth, he tilts his head left and right, stretching it out and swirling the top of the penis within his mouth. Ethan could taste the salty sweat and the funky smell was mixed in with a hint of chlorine from the pool.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes shut and used his tongue to find its way underneath the foreskin. He could feel The Man’s piss slit, and as he pushed his tongue harder into it, Ethan noted how it had a different taste from the rest of the head. The slit had a taste much like some kind of pungent sugar and it drove him mad.<br />
<br />
He kept his tongue on the inside of The Man’s foreskin swishing left to right on the underside of the head, stimulating the frenulum simultaneously, then a 360, left, right, 360, left right, 360. Ethan let it sit in his mouth unmoved for a minute while he inhaled the scent again; he loved the mouth feel as well, this may be a monster but it felt like a squishy fleshy marshmallow. Ethan curled his lips inwards creating a pillow of protection from his teeth; he remembered one of the guys in the locker rooms boasting about how one of their girlfriends did it. With the added cushioning, he sucked in hard trying to get as much of the shaft as he could, then he clasped his jaws together, pressing down into the flesh and smoothly pulled it out. The penis flopped down like a happy sea cucumber.<br />
<br />
Ethan stared at it lovingly and inched even closer, his joints were at their limit; thank god for yoga. It was now right up in his face and he gave it one last peck before releasing his arms and legs.<br />
<br />
It took him a hot minute to stretch and get up. He approached the mirror and grinned at his reflection. That was so weird, but so goddamn hot. Ethan pressed his left palm against the wall, that was next to the mirror, and shift into it most of his weight. He used his free hand to FINALLY jerk off like a normal person. Plus, he still had to measure the cock again in an erect state.<br />
<br />
‘Okay, so it’s getting there…’<br />
<br />
‘Well that’s taking a while…’<br />
<br />
‘Ha… isn’t it kinda weird you didn’t get hard at all the whole time you were…?’<br />
<br />
Reality sinks in. Ethan pauses for a second and then started jerking the cock faster. Harder, he’s squeezing it, slapping it, swearing at it, apologizing to it. He could only get a semi-hard on.<br />
<br />
“Shit did I break his cock?” Ethan shakes his head, “His cock? Who’s he? This is mine! This is MY cock! MY balls, everything!” He grabs it again and starts frantically pulling and squeezing, it was pretty much just a squishy toy at this point.<br />
<br />
“I literally just lent you out for one day!” He cried, frustrated, Ethan ran his fingers through his disheveled hair. He falls backwards onto the bed, rubbing his face vigorously. He looks back at the mirror, no weird trip doppelganger fantasy here, that’s him alright and this is actually happening.<br />
<br />
Ethan takes a few deep breaths and continues to take a good look in the mirror. He is a healthy 17 year old athlete. He earned this body; he worked hard to achieve it. Dots started to connect and Ethan stood up, was that it? Did he just feel like he didn’t earn the ownership of his dick because he was born genetically lucky down south?<br />
<br />
His eyes focused on the soft, albeit, brick house of a dick and just like when he stuffed his pants in the boys’ lavatory earlier that day, something felt off, despite being re-united with his old buddy it truly didn’t actually feel like it was ‘his’.<br />
<br />
“But Eric’s did?” He said to himself out loud.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was because Eric’s junk was so goddamn sensitive, his own equipment just could not compete?<br />
<br />
“Quality over quantity huh?” Ethan pondered, bouncing the huge thing on the palm of his hand. He can feel the stirring, he can feel ‘aroused’ but there doesn’t seem to be enough juice to start the engine.<br />
<br />
‘Limp-dick Ethan’<br />
<br />
The intrusive thoughts were coming…but oddly so did a tickling of electricity running through his veins. Ethan placed his right hand to his mouth while the other rested on his hip “No… no, no, no… I have to be a man, I have to be THE man of the house, dad’s a bust and Eric is just a kid, what would mom-” He shakes his head “… I need to fix this”.<br />
<br />
‘Maybe you could go fuck yourself?’<br />
<br />
“Oh ha ha!”<br />
<br />
‘No, like, seriously- clog that filtration system’<br />
<br />
Ethan’s cock twitched…but it still didn’t get hard.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m… I’m not ready for that”.<br />
<br />
‘Look at you! Ethan Morales Boy Wonder! You’re an impotent teen who’s still putting others’ happiness above their own. Most men in your shoes would probably go kill themselves’.<br />
<br />
“Not cool brain, not cool”<br />
<br />
‘Lo siento’.<br />
<br />
Ethan let this sit for a minute. Asshole brain did have a point… He always appeared cool, calm and collected among his peers, but having a small penis, he had allowed himself to space out, to freak out and lose control in some ways, he had experienced a rollercoaster of emotions today… Ethan realized that it had possibly been the most genuine he had ever been in years.<br />
<br />
What worked before? It had only been a day, but it was enough to open Ethan’s eyes to just how oblivious he had been about a plethora of things. The family didn’t have enough money for therapy, so perhaps this would have happened regardless of the magic ring. Maybe things will go back to how they were after a few days or maybe Ethan was destined to be impotent regardless of the switch?<br />
<br />
‘Limp-dick Et-‘ Shh!<br />
<br />
“Jerking off… was it actually fun before? Maybe…I don’t know… it was something to do, Ha…” Ethan crossed his arms, “My dick was already so big by the time I was 8 I think... I think I was 5 inches hard back then, that’s already the adult average”<br />
<br />
Ethan couldn’t remember the first time it happened, but he does remember how it kept happening. Kids from school would find out about his great endowment and they’d naturally get curious, asked to see it, asked to touch it, to do all kinds of things with it. Of course, children are incredibly honest creatures, by the time he got into high school his voyeuristic sessions had dwindled to practically none.<br />
<br />
When had been the last time someone asked to see it? Perhaps just before freshman year, when his father moved him and Eric to a less financially demanding neighborhood resulting in him switching schools.<br />
<br />
No one had asked to take a look at his dick since coming here, ‘So no one in my current school had ever seen my actual bare dick in the full? How was that possible?’ Ethan searched through his memory for the past 3 - 4 years or so. The peeps in his current school may have definitely stolen a few peeks at his crotch now and again, but that wouldn’t be a confirmation of size. You’d think they would have gawked in the locker room but Ethan had just realized that each guy would avert their eyes immediately as soon as his hands reached his Speedos, it was unbeknownst to him the reason why back then, but now that he had experienced having a small dick, it made so much sense. He couldn’t even look at Greg when he got pantsed in front of him, they must have been scared to confirm their inadequacy.<br />
<br />
Is that what made him extra nervous today? No one in that school had seen him completely bare, at least not in the front, so if they had caught him all diminished then it would be their first impression and have been another thing for him to worry about, on top of good grades and athleticism.<br />
<br />
But failing at achieving a high grade or falling behind at gym had never given him such a visceral reaction as it did to the idea of getting caught with a nub between his legs; it surely as hell did not get him as excited either.<br />
<br />
His grades and his muscles were solid, tangible issues that, were he to fail he could pick himself back up again. But the majority of modern society views a man’s cock as the epitome of machismo authentication. There was nothing a man could do about his size outside of surgery and hoping on mostly unreliable snake oil. Were they to see him in that pathetic state, the image of ‘Ethan The Man’ would be in ruins. No more ‘Don schlong’ or ‘King Dong’ or ‘Mount-me-Python’. Any praise or acknowledgement of greatness would exclusively be dependant on those previously aforementioned tangible issues.<br />
<br />
That honestly did not sound too bad to Ethan. He looked at his crotch where the stubbornly flaccid penis hung and gave it a flick, it didn’t bounce like Eric’s did, just sort of reclined on his finger for a second before gravity brought it down again. There was no shiver down his spine, no tingle, almost like he had just rubbed against his forearm; and that oddly didn’t bother him anymore.<br />
<br />
Would it be so awful if he became impotent? Ethan had begun masturbating to please other people’s curiosities and when it eventually came to jerking off ‘for himself’ and by himself it was just ‘something to do’ usually just to exhaust his body enough to help him fall asleep.<br />
<br />
Jerking off didn’t feel unpleasant… but it did feel like a chore sometimes, like swim practice before the actual match. Ethan raised his head and once again looked at HIS reflection. “It didn’t matter if it was a boy or a girl, everyone was always so focused on my penis, and the idea of ‘The Man’ but no one really cared about what I wanted or who I was…” His eyes scanned the full length mirror meticulously.<br />
<br />
“I really messed up my hair… god my legs…my shoulders they’re stiff…” Ethan said out loud. He traced the red marks left on his ass with a few fingers and smiled, flicking the soft 6 inch sleeping monster again, just to double check. Ethan DID work really hard to achieve this body, he loved swimming and even enjoyed excelling academically, ‘Ethan Morales’ was more than his penis, perhaps this had been a blessing in disguise?<br />
<br />
“I wanted to see myself… and I did” Ethan was seeing more of that dimpled mischievous grin, it was a foray into new exciting territory “Hey there limp-dick!”</p>
