<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly sat in the surf watching the last 4 humans transform into merfolk, she was either proud of herself. So far all of the other 6 new merfolk had accepted the sea with little to no issue. The elders who had sent her out had warned that accepting the sea could be trouble for some humans and once she brought the new merfolk back to Atlantis she would hand them off to the doctors and elders who would help them fully accept the sea and their new lives as merfolk.  <br />
<br />
There would be hard times ahead for them, she knew from stories from her parents that it took them a while to fully accept the sea, once the rush of becoming a mermaid or a merman ended and realization of all that was left behind on the shore hit it was hard for some people. Her mother said it was worse for her because she had become a mermaid when she had been a human man, so she would expect those who had switched gender would have a harder time accepting their new lives. <br />
<br />
She looked over the humans she had transformed with her own eyes, she had to report on which former humans she expected to have the hardest time accepting the sea and which had the accepted the sea and their new lives already. She looked toward Nate and Rose, the first two she transformed. They seamed happy enough, but she wasn’t fully sure either, so middle of the road. Same with Taylor, she had accepted the change with ease, the issue was her former boyfriend now girlfriend Sam. <br />
<br />
Sam was going to be one of the hard ones, there was a chance that her former male side tried to fight back harder then the others. Still having the love of his now her life beside her would help and add now that they where in a poly relationship with Nate and Rose meaning there was a chance to have 3 pregnant mermaids from a single relationship was a huge benefit for her people. <br />
<br />
Amanda and Robert looked to fully embraced the sea as well, Amanda seamed to have been a repressed sexual wise female human and becoming a free loving mermaid would help her a lot to accept the sea and hopefully her new sex drive would help her become a mother quickly and add to the population of merfolk. She seamed to be already on that road judging by how she was all but sitting on Robert’s dick and pressing his face into her now massive breasts. Robert seamed to be willing to accept mermanhood to get a much better body and having a sexy mermaid all but want fuck his brain out was worth the trade. So she wasn’t worried about those two.<br />
<br />
Now the final four, Cat seamed to have already fully embraced the sea even as she moaned loudly in pleasure as she and Aaron reached their peak. From what the others had told them Cat had dreamed of becoming a mermaid all her life and she turned into a fine example of a mermaid. Her boyfriend Aaron seamed to be somewhere between Robert and Nate/Rose/Taylor on her concern list. He didn’t seam to fully embrace the sea or becoming a merman but having a mermaid who really wants to fuck your brains out really is a pusher to accept the sea and judging by the smile on his face he seamed to be enjoying the mermaid version of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
The issue she could already see was Azumi and Zack, unlike the others they had tried to run and had both switched genders during the process of becoming merfolk. They would be trouble.<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Azumi in a new deeper voice as she looked at herself, her chest had flattened out but became muscular even as she looked down at her green tail which was much thicker than her legs had ever been and much longer as well. <br />
<br />
“Azumi?” inquired a voice beside her as she turned her head and looked, beside her sitting on the was a bare-chested black women mermaid with a rather rare and beautiful bronze color tail lied on the beach, her curly black hair framing a face that belonged on a model. She felt her face flushed, that was wrong why did she feel that, then she felt something else, something hardening. She looked down to see slipping out of a gap between her scale a rather large and clearly male penis. She was a he, that is when it hit him, she had become a merman.<br />
<br />
Beside him, Zack was dumbfounded as he looked at the two rather impressive mounds on his chest, the nipples which where hard and very sensitive, a gust of wind caused him to moan a bit before he used a now much smaller arm to cover them up. He looked down missing his muscles even if what he saw would have given him a wet dream in the past, then he noticed the rather large penis coming out of the handsome Asian merman beside him. Visions of him taking that thing in his mouth and other places filled his mind for a moment even as he noticed the area around his crotch was getting wet and a slit was visible in a gap in his scales. He was a she, and she was turned on.<br />
<br />
“Turn us back!” yelled Azumi using his hands to cover his hard on.<br />
<br />
“Can’t.” answered Shelly “It is a one way process as far as I know, now why don’t you come to the sea and we can head back to Atlantis and you can all…”<br />
<br />
“Never you mother fucker, you had no right to transform us.” Stated Zack in a much more feminine voice.<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but what is done and done and you humans had no right to dump all that toxic waste in our oceans killing so many of us.” Countered Shelly using one of the points she had been told to use. “Besides, what are you going to do? You can’t stay on dry land forever you will dry out and die.”<br />
<br />
“We can call the police and….” Started Azumi <br />
<br />
“And we would end up in some government lab somewhere.” Added Zack as she looked at Azumi, he was rather handsome. No he pushed that thought and those ideas from his head.<br />
<br />
“Fuck.” Cursed Azumi<br />
<br />
“Correct.” Said Zack “We are fucked either way. We either go out to sea and hope we can come back somehow or we can end up in some government lab.”<br />
<br />
For the longest time either of them spoke then with a heavy sigh Azumi rolled over and using her/his new muscles began to pull himself toward the sea. With a final curse, Zack did the same.<br />
<br />
“Come on in the water is great!” yelled Cat as she swam into the sea and did a few jumps before pulling herself onto the dock joining the other mermaids and merman in line. Her boyfriend Aaron joined her as well but without the leaps. <br />
<br />
“So come on.” Said Shelly as she took one last look around, as the new mermaids and merman slipped off the dock or entered the water from the beach and with that done all 11 of them sunk below the water and began to swim faster then any human or even boat could go toward Atlantis.</p>
