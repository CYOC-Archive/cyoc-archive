<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle fell back onto his bed as a tingling sensation overtook his lower half. His legs had gone numb, and he found he couldn&#39;t move them. He felt the muscles begin to tense and stretch as the changes started.<br />
<br />
The first to change were his feet. They softened, becoming daintier and feminine. A small layer of pudge settled on them, much to Kyle&#39;s surprise. Though having initially shrunk, a pulse of energy traveled up from his toes as his feet began to grow. A bolt of anxiety pierced Kyle&#39;s mind as they tripled in size, becoming far larger than any feet he&#39;d ever seen. They widened, his heels thickening and his toed splaying out. The stretching sensation continued until they reached nearly 30 inches long. To his horror, his big toes alone were each almost the size of his hand. Then the changes moved up.<br />
<br />
The coarse leg hair he had disappeared as his skin feminized. His calves expanded out, softening considerably. He felt his scrawny muscles bulk considerably as his legs bulged with muscle, dense and strong. They began to grow, the same pulsing and stretching as his feet making their way up to his knees. Soon they reached nearly 3 feet long. A thick layer of fat grew in over his calves, causing them to dwarf his torso. They squished together uncomfortably, his new calves and feet pulling at his hips as they hung off the end of his bed. At this point, Kyle was on the verge of panic, but the changes continued.<br />
<br />
His knees swelled up as the changes reached his thighs. A thick layer of fat enveloped his knees, causing them to all but disappear. Dimples formed on each side as his thighs began to expand to match his calves. The underlying muscle pushed his thighs out beyond his shoulders, widening them until each thigh spread out farther than he could reach. They grew to nearly 4 feet long, an incomprehensible size to the scrawny nerd. But then the fat grew.<br />
<br />
Coming in heaps, his thighs jiggled and pulsed underneath him. Each spurt caused his bed to creak as they grew wider and wider. A layer of fat grew in over his knees, and he felt fat under his thighs bunch and fold uncomfortably in the confined space. They continued to expand outward as the changes reached his hips, filling his bed and threatening to break it.<br />
<br />
He felt his hips and ass heat up. Muscle and fat were now building simultaneously, bulging under his softening skin. He felt his torso push up as the bed creaked underneath. His butt began to press against the back of his bed, pushing his torso forward as it piled up behind him. He had a hard time even comprehending how much of his bed he could feel under and behind him, his hips and legs filling the bed.  His hips bulked up, a fupa growing and concealing his small cock. He wanted to cry as he felt it shift, a new hole opening behind his receding balls. A pouch of fat grew in on his belly as his new ovaries formed, his penis now a clit. His new pussy was gigantic, befitting his new legs. To his shame, he felt his clit swell larger than his cock had been. Not that he could see it, hidden under a mound of fat.<br />
<br />
He felt the fat on his hips begin to hang off of both sides of his bed as the growth continued. His hips and thighs swelled for what felt like an eternity, until they finally reached the same scale as his feet. As a final &quot;fuck you&quot; from the curse, he felt a wave of changes overtake his upper body. His body hair thinned out, his skin softened, and his torso feminized. He felt his face round out, too. He wanted to cry as he took in what he&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
From the waist up, he was a scrawny, feminine nerd. From the waist down, however, things were different. The curse gave him the full 10 feet of legs it could. That alone would be bad enough, but it also added a disproportionate amount of fat to his lower half. Grabbing at it, he was met with soft, jiggling flesh expanding out farther than he could reach. He felt like a living waterbed. His hips measured a mind-boggling 300 inches around, his thighs each nearly the size of his old bed. The weight was immense, pulling at his skin and keeping him firmly rooted to his bed. Each leg weighed nearly 1500lbs, so there was no way he was pulling himself up. Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t do more than press his hands into hid hips. His hands sunk into them past his elbow, meeting almost no resistance and no leverage.<br />
<br />
A blinding flash overtook him as the room spun. &quot;Everyone will see it as normal,&quot; he remembered her saying. He felt a sickening sensation that his life was about to get very different...</p>
