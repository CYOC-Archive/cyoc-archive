<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Erick-<br />
<br />
The fire surrounded him now, it burned the fresh water which had flourished in his eyes. Sei was gone, there was nothing he could do, except perhaps escape this hell.<br />
<br />
Although the fire surrounded him he could see that the exit was the least enflamed. He made a quick choice and jumped through the doorway. He was scorched but only slightly. He threw of his jacket which had caught fire.<br />
<br />
Erick ran down the corridor into the darkness. However as he kept going he found he was making now progress, constantly running past the same table with the flowerpot on it. He stopped and realised he was in a loop. This manor was stopping him from escaping. <br />
“MIKE-“ a voice screamed past Erick.<br />
<br />
He looked around, it sounded like Sei. “Sei is that you??” He said looking into the darkness, he ran towards the voice.<br />
<br />
Instead of finding the same table he found the main entrance. He was on the second floor of the room, and saw to his horror the walls completely enflamed. The skylight was open, shining a deep white aura down on the first floor carpet. Erick stopped in horror though when he found what was on that carpet. <br />
<br />
It was a beast. A giant hulking monster, that was laying there most likely unconscious. Erick could most likely correlate it to some sort of werewolf, however it was too large for that description. Sporting dagger long claws, a rough brown coat that ran across its entire body and a hideous maw confirming that this creature was something from hell. Erick put the pieces together and realised this was formerly Ryan.<br />
He had no time for grief, especially with the state of the manor. Although he saw the corpse of Mike he could not see the corpse of Maisy, perhaps her corpse had been taken by Charlotte. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the beast ruptured upwards, carrying itself at 2 metres tall. Its muscle size was ridiculous bigger than anything Erick had ever seen; he knew there was no way he could fight that monstrosity. However it didn’t seem to notice him, instead the monster pounded of the double doors ripping them apart. It was gone in seconds.<br />
<br />
Erick sighed, even though he knew he had just lost his best friend.<br />
<br />
Erick made his way down the stairs and was about to leave when he was stopped by a voice.<br />
<br />
“Erick….you got out” <br />
<br />
He turned around and saw Seth. Her jumper had disappeared, and her tights had been ripped leaving her elements exposed. “I w-was so worried about you”.<br />
<br />
“S-seth…you escaped” Erick said putting his hands behind his back and slowly edging his way to Mikes corpse.<br />
<br />
“Oh Erick….I was so scared, I saw you and Jon walking down into the basement and the door shut behind you, I tried everything to save you. I’m so glad your okay” she said softly.<br />
<br />
Her face burned bright red, illuminated by the raging fire.<br />
<br />
“Come Erick, lets escape togeth-“<br />
<br />
Suddenly Seth was thrown back by a blast to the chest. Blood spurted everywhere as she was knocked into the back wall.<br />
<br />
“Eat Lead Bitch” Erick said dropping the double-barrel on to the ground.<br />
<br />
Seth screamed out apparently still alive. Erick was shocked but not surprised. He grabbed the double barrel off the ground and walked towards the body.<br />
<br />
“Y-you knew” Seth muttered, blood leaking off her lips.<br />
<br />
“Our future rests in my hands” Erick said bringing out the copy of Spellstorm Horror.<br />
<br />
“Seth Julie, unknown. I know what that means now” Erick said bringing the shotgun to her face.<br />
<br />
“Seth….well…I guess your right” she said.<br />
<br />
Erick pulled the trigger and Seth’s face exploded, leaving a gorey mess on the ground.<br />
<br />
“I know you would of survived that Charlotte, but I think that’s given me enough time to escape” Erick said running out of the manor. <br />
He kept on running, into the darkness feeling the rain against his skin. He didn’t know where Ryan went but he didn’t really care. As long as he was free of this house. He looked behind him and saw to his horror a figure rise from the flaming building. It was likely Charlotte in Seth’s body so Erick made his way into the treeline.<br />
<br />
Whatever Charlotte was…she could heal her hosts body since Erick saw that Seth had restored herself.<br />
<br />
Erick waited a little bit before standing back on the road. Rain dripped off his face. He dropped to the ground in the rain and started to weep. “Why….did I do this….”<br />
<br />
“All of this, everything in this blasted last day has been my fault. I was the one who brought them all here. The ringleader that bitch wanted me to be. I couldn’t stop Sei killing Mike, I couldn’t stop Seth being possessed, I couldn’t stop Jon being taken, I couldn’t stop Ryan transforming and I couldn’t save Maisy. WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE WHO LIVES!!” He screams out.<br />
<br />
“E-erick” said a familiar voice behind him.<br />
<br />
For the last time, Erick turned towards the voice and looked at the shadowy figure coming towards him. “Charlotte….just end it, please” he cried.<br />
<br />
“You survived…you got out the manor” said the voice.<br />
<br />
Erick recognised the voice now. It was new, something sweet that I hadn’t heard since he was knocked unconscious. Not a nightmare but something good. It was….Maisy.<br />
<br />
“M-maisy” Erick said softly, standing up, looking towards her.<br />
“Erick….” She said calmly.<br />
<br />
She ran towards him and hugged him, both of them falling down onto the ground.<br />
“I thought you died” Erick cried out.<br />
<br />
“Nah…that monster only slapped me, I’m much more resilient than that” She said<br />
<br />
“Everyone’s gone Maisy….because of this house” he said looking towards the flaming inferno.<br />
<br />
“Yes….but maybe not….those two creatures that left here. They’re still around, it could be possible to stop this from happening again” Maisy said determined.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Erick questioned.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t end with this manor….it ends with Spellstorm. And we….must be the ones to end it Erick. For them, for everyone lost to this house. Because this book may know the future, but it doesn’t know shit after now. We choose. We must stop this from ever happening again by hunting those monsters down”.<br />
<br />
“Your right Maisy” he said, them both standing back up,  looking away from Spellstorm manor.<br />
<br />
“We must end this….” Erick said.<br />
<br />
They both looked ahead of them and smiled, walking down the path together, ready to end this nightmare.</p>
