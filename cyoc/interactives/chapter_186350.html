<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An hour later Henry was reconsidering things. Evidently Alicia had taken the statement ‘Female from the waist up’ differently to what he had in mind. He had thought he would get to wear one of Alicia’s blouses that showed off his breasts to full advantage but here she was once more tightening the corset onto him. She was intending to make his top totally female including him wearing the wig and getting his face done.<br />
<br />
He should have got suspicious when she had asked him to have a shave, he had already shaved in the morning. Why would he need to shave twice in a day? But he had done as he was told when she showed him the stockings and garter belt she was intending to wear under her skirt. Evidently, they were in her suitcase as another honeymoon surprise. As Alicia had said to him. “I’ll be fulfilling my part of the bargain ‘As sexy as you can make it’ now you have to let me make your top as sexy as I can make it as well” <br />
<br />
Henry couldn’t actually remember making this bargain but he was already in deep over his head. He had stupidly said “Go for it”<br />
Now she was tightening the corset onto him once more. Evidently part of having a sexy top was having a thin waist and the only way Alicia could achieve that was by making him put on the corset. “The top I have in mind wouldn’t fit over your tummy”<br />
<br />
Once the corset had narrowed Henry’s waist to an extent that satisfied Alicia she fitted him into a black lacy bra. “This is a bit of a push-up bra that will enhance your cleavage” she explained. It was certainly tighter than the sports bra had had worn earlier and looking down he could certainly see that it did indeed enhance his cleavage.<br />
<br />
Next was a black, silky feeling camisole. “This one is only satin. It will hide the corset” It certainly didn’t hide Henry’s cleavage. If anything, it focused even more attention onto Henry’s breasts.<br />
<br />
If Henry thought that was the end of it he was mistaken. Over the top of what he already had on, Henry had to wear a long-sleeved black, lace garment. “It’s part of a bodysuit I bought when I was with Sandra. Luckily the panties are detachable otherwise Mister Marvellous would be locked away”<br />
The lace thing was quite stretchy and with Alicia’s help it was soon covering Henry’s upper body. The lace extended down to his wrists. There was a floral pattern in the lace. Even though the garment came up to Henry’s neck his cleavage and the camisole were still very visible through the lace. <br />
<br />
“Hmm I like it” said Alicia. “Even better than I pictured. The lace hides your hairy arms. Yeah, that will do nicely. How about you go and dress your bottom half while I get myself ready”<br />
<br />
Henry went to the bedroom and put on his new black trousers, his socks and his dress shoes. Thanks to the corset it still looked like he had a big bum. If he ignored his head he looked like a sexy woman in trousers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Alicia had taken her clothes to the bathroom to get herself prepared. She didn’t want Henry to see the half-finished product.<br />
She put the stockings and garter belt over some black G-string panties. Then a black leather midi-skirt with a row of buttons down the front. Ironically this was the skirt she had planned to wear with the top Henry was currently wearing. She had bought the outfit for a potential night of clubbing.<br />
<br />
She then put on Henry’s white business shirt and tried to do up his tie. It took a couple of attempts to get it right. After tucking the shirt into the skirt she called to Henry. “Are you dressed? How about you order room service for 7? I&#39;ll be a while yet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you feel like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your choice. Actually make it Japanese. Is there a banquet for two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get to it&quot; replied Henry &quot;But you answer the door when it gets delivered. I&#39;ll be hiding&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry knew Alicia loved Japanese food so he was not surprised by her choice. While on the phone he also ordered two bottles of chardonnay to come with the meal. That done he sat on the couch and once more fondled his breasts.<br />
<br />
Sometime later Alicia called out &quot;I&#39;m ready. Come in here and I&#39;ll start on you&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry entered the bathroom and couldn&#39;t help but say &quot;Wow&quot; when he saw Alicia. &quot;That looks really nice&quot; as he took in her skirt, the shoes she was wearing and her make-up job. She still looked ultra feminine despite wearing a men&#39;s suit jacket. She was a giantess as well. With the heels she had to be at least 6&#39;5. She certainly towered over Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I had better take the heels off before I begin on you otherwise I&#39;ll get a sore back&quot; she giggled. &quot;Actually let&#39;s do this in the kitchen. I don&#39;t want you to see before I&#39;m finished&quot;<br />
<br />
So Henry found himself sitting on the Kitchen bench as Alicia went to work on his face. He had made the obligatory protest when she had first mentioned make-up but secretly was looking forward to what Alicia could do. He had gone past the point of no return when he had put that sexy camisole on earlier. He decided he may as well enjoy the whole experience.<br />
<br />
Alicia went to work. She didn&#39;t explain what she was doing and it seemed to take ages. He was amazed at how many layers of different potions went onto his face, some with pads, others with brushes. No doubt Alicia would need to replenish her make-up stocks when this was finished. Her only instructions for him were that he had to stay still. He did object however when she bought out her eyebrow trimmer. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way! You are not shaving my eyebrows&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they are so bushy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Alicia. That is going too far. I think I&#39;ve been a pretty good sport about this but you are not trimming or cutting any of my facial hair&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I lighten them then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with dye&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a sort of make-up. It wears off&quot; She didn&#39;t tell him it was guaranteed to last for 48 hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then&quot;<br />
<br />
Alicia went to work on his eyebrows. She glanced at the clock. 15 minutes until dinner was due. That should be just the right amount of time. Henry was good at keeping his eyes closed as she applied shadow but kept blinking as she attempted to apply mascara. &quot;Henry this will take all night unless you keep still. I&#39;ve done this thousands of times. I won&#39;t poke you in the eye&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally she started on Henry&#39;s lips. She used a small paintbrush rather than a tube of lipstick though. She was painting on a colour that he guessed was the same as bright red lips she currently had, but even that needed multiple applications. No wonder women took so long to get ready. Then when he thought she was finally ready she said &quot;One more layer. Just sealer so you don&#39;t leave lipstick on the wine glasses&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are we done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need to fix your hair&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have a look?<br />
<br />
&quot;In five minutes&quot; Alicia returned to the bathroom and retrieved the wig. She placed a net of some kind on his head first. Tightened it, then fitted the wig on top. After a bit of adjustment she asked &quot;Are you sure I can&#39;t trim your sideburns. They show&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you can&#39;t shave off my sideburns&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you are done then. Go to the bathroom and have a look&quot;</p>
