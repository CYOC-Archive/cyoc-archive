<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emma and Jason, a pair of fresh, young newlyweds held hands as they trod up the path between the farm house and the barn, an ocean of silence between the two. The 23-year-old Jason stood almost two heads taller than the meek girl, Emma, his muscular palm burying his wife’s hand inside his as they walked on towards what the girl needed help with.<br />
<br />
“It’s Carmine, you see.” Emma flashed a bright smile towards Jason, trying to look cheery and happy like she always did, but having trouble fayning it today. “That stubborn jenny, she gets grumpy sometimes and it takes a bit of muscle to pull out, you know…”<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Jason nodded bluntly, Emma’s face hollowing at the terse reply, wishing he’d engage her in some small talk.<br />
<br />
They’d been married for less than a month, and to Emma, it already felt like things were on the downturn. They were raised Christian going to the same church together when they were young, and Emma always had a deep crush on Jason for as long as she could remember. Jason left that crush of hers unrequited for so long.<br />
<br />
The church, of course, taught celibacy until marriage, a precept that Emma dutifully followed and… Jason didn’t. It was a poorly kept secret that he plowed through all the pretty girls in high school, and upon graduating, left the small country town they’d grown up in for a few years to sleep around even more. Anyone would expect a deeply religious girl like Emma to be shattered by infidelity to such an extreme degree, but much to the contrary, Emma was thrilled by it, thrilled she landed such a stud!<br />
<br />
The slight-looking brunette meekly nudged closer to her husband, trying to fill the figurative rift between the two by getting physically closer. Jason didn’t pay her any mind. He seemed checked out, more focused on completing the little chore his wife was calling him to do.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t always like this. Emma remembered the day almost two years ago that Jason trod back into town, visibly worse off than when he left. Life outside their little town must have been filled with flavorless and hollow on-night flings that he had been quickly growing tired of. At first, she could never imagine a ten-out-of-ten-looking guy like Jason ever accepting her. She wasn’t the prettiest girl by any means or particularly exciting at all, but the day he came back, she realized that maybe that was what he was looking for. She could see the weariness in his eyes, that little boy she knew as a young girl needing an honest woman’s comfort. And it was then she saw her chance.<br />
<br />
She mustered the courage to ask Jason out the first day he was back. He said it was the first time a woman ever really asked him, and he was into it! A few months later they were the happy-go-lucky couple Emma always dreamed of. She pushed him to marry him quickly so she could have him for herself, the then-virgin’s overflowing desire for this muscular man-stud hidden under her meek trad-wife exterior, completing the marriage that the church needed of them so they could finally consummate their relationship. Straight afterward the wedding they had a two-week honeymoon in Cancun, and it was then that reality started to set in.<br />
<br />
He liked to fuck, and he was huge. She let him have her six times the first day, the sex not the romantic gentle loving a girl like her would idealize but hard, bestial fuckings. She realized Jason must have gotten over the romantic lovey-dovey sex in high school and after banging so many girls, it became he only got off to sex that were raunchy and brutal. At first, she hated it, but then she loved it, but then she started feeling raw and sore. She wanted to impress him – to please him, letting him have her in any hole he wanted only feel the pain the next day. It got to the point where all she could offer that 9-inch cock was a blow job, the girl unable to fit more than Jason’s tip in her mouth.<br />
<br />
It was killing her. He wasn’t mean or cruel even during sex. His libido was too much for her to handle and he was so big! She loved him still. She wanted to worship him like the Adonis he was – the mind willing but the flesh too weak!<br />
<br />
Once they got back the honeymoon was over both literally and figuratively, that giddy, young romance between them quickly dissipating until… well, she didn’t know what was left. In the last few weeks, she could only manage sex sparingly, trying her best to accommodate her husband’s needs but finding it hurt so much!<br />
<br />
Worst of all, she wanted to try for children with him because she always wanted a family, but he’d always insist on wearing a condom. It was a deep, growing fear in the darker recesses of her mind: He must not want to have children so that he didn’t become tethered to her.<br />
<br />
“I think I can go again tonight. I can out least do a blow job for you…” Emma promised in a meek whisper, trying to excite her husband as her voice started becoming so quiet it was fainter than a mouse’s squeak. “I want to see your babies and… I want to have your babies…” She said near-wordlessy in an imperceptible plea.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine.” Jason replied in an emotionless monotone, not hearing the baby part. “You started to bleed last time. You need a break. I get it.”<br />
<br />
He must have been rejecting her.<br />
<br />
Fear and panic opened up all at once in Emma’s mind. He gets it!? Does he get that things feel like they’re falling apart!? She’s trying her best, really! Emma knew full well that a sex-less marriage is as good as gone! Does he get how terrified she is that this marriage was beginning to feel a like a train starting to roll down a mountain, the problems slow and subtle at first, but soon everything would become unstoppable and crash in an ignominious divorce!? She’d be ostracized by the church and local community, but worse yet, she’d lose him, the one thing she ever wanted in life more than anything since she was a little girl! She couldn’t bear it. She’d do anything to keep him…<br />
<br />
Emma got queasy. She could feel it. The marriage was as good as doomed from the start. Such a small, homely girl like her couldn’t have possibly hoped to keep such a handsome man’s attention. There was only one thing she knew she could do to keep him. One thing that’d make sure he’d never leave her.<br />
<br />
“She’s right in her stall over there. She knows going outside means having to do work so she’d not having it.” Emma buried the turmoil she was ruminating on, pointing Jason towards the stall with a jenny that was nearly the size of a quarter horse. “She just needs a bit of muscle... Oh! And let me keep your phone, she might kick and she’s butt-level with ya so she could crush whatever’s in your pockets.”<br />
<br />
Jason nodded, fishing his smart phone out and leaving it in his wife’s hands. Being a country boy, he wasn’t any stranger to handling a few animals and had persuade Carmine out of her stall plenty of times before. Little did he know, this time it’d be a lot different.<br />
<br />
As Jason grabbed the stubborn ass the halter to pull, Emma unlocked his phone using the pincode she knew, quickly downloading the Yiffr app that she’d heard of online on women’s forums. Woman older than her said the app was an “easy way to outright win a divorce settlement”. By turning their husbands into animals, they’d get everything, house, money, and kids. But Emma didn’t want to use it for those things. She just wanted Jason and she wanted him to be happy.<br />
<br />
Her husband was none-the-wiser to her messing with his phone, the burly man tugging on it hard as Carmine splayed her legs and dug her hooves into the floorboard. The man grunted and the donkey brayed, the two powerful creatures locked at an impasse as neither wanted to budge. Emma quickly fiddled with the app, making the necessary adjustments for Jason, making sure she clicked the “reality change” option box so nobody remembered about this but her.<br />
<br />
No one would remember the doomed marriage… no one would even remember Jason but her, and he would finally be happy.<br />
<br />
She pressed the “Go wild!” button, feeling her worries evaporate. Somehow feeling that despite everything, this was the right choice.<br />
<br />
“Gahh! She’s extra ornery today!” Jason growled through grit teeth. She was stuck there like a boulder, her muscles tensing and nostrils flaring.<br />
<br />
“M-maybe get behind her and push!” Emma suggested, “A push and a slap on the ass might get her going!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, alright.” Jason relaxed his grip, circling around the donkey, giving the animal a warning. “But if you kick me, little miss Carmine, fun and games are over!”<br />
<br />
The stable was starting to feel humid. Carmine was blasting puffs of steam from her nostrils, her grey coat growing slick and sweaty like something besides Jason’s pushing was really starting to work her up. The man got right behind her, placing both hands on her rump as he fought fruitlessly to get her to move.<br />
<br />
“Go on, girl! You don’t wanna see me mad!” Jason huffed, raising a hand in the air before lashing it the jenny’s rear like a whip with an open palm, sound out a wet, meaty “slap!”. <br />
<br />
The donkey mare shrieked out a screeching bray as her butt jolted…  going the opposite way! She bowled Jason over and slammed his shoulder against the wall, leaving him pinned between the stall’s wall and…<br />
<br />
Jason didn’t know what it was at first. All he could equate it too was a rubber-bag full of Jell-o after being blasted to “nuclear” in a microwave. It squashed against his face like hot, soggy meat, a splash of the concentrated fish-taste splattering across his cheeks as something obnoxiously plump massage his nose, flicking a cherry-red protrusion right up against his nostrils.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Lord…” Emma ran into the stall, fearing a blow like that might have ended the marriage in an entirely different way! He was twitching and moving though, his hand digging into her fat, muscular flanks like he was trying to get her to move, his pleas to his mouth drowned out by the sounds of juicy squelches from underneath Carmine’s ass.<br />
<br />
It was so gross; so lewd. It was why Emma couldn’t bring her to use the app on herself, she couldn’t begin to even imagine what it’d be like that – a smelly sex-starved animal in heat. She’d kept the jenny isolated from other males on the farm to get her riled up for her new partner, but she didn’t think a female could be so aggressive! Emma thought about leaving until it was over… but some sordid curiosity inside her really wanted to watch her husband change into a real stud.<br />
<br />
Jason coughed and sputtered as he called for his wife, his whole head buried under a slick slime of cunt-snot! Even someone as experienced with sex as him couldn’t grasp that he was buried inside a horny mare’s pussy. No girl was this wet, it was like he was making out with an over-productive slug. Heaping strands of syrupy goo dribbled onto Jason’s torso leaving his plaid shirt sopping wet under a waterfall of bestial heat.<br />
<br />
And, oh, the heat. Velvety, rubbery flesh scorched against his face, the sweltering, humid intensity harder to withstand than a Swedish sauna, his face feeling like it was boiling as those asinine donkey lips smooched against his cheek. He pushed and pulled against Carmine, only for his hands to sink into those muscular-fatty flanks of jenny ass, his entire body falling victim to her heat as her ropey tail clamped down against the back of his head, pull him even closer into the bestial embrace with her sex.<br />
<br />
“PPPpppbbbtt…!”<br />
<br />
A gloopy queef plopped out of Carmine’s vagina as the lusty mare mashed Jason’s face into her pussy. His resistance grew weak, the man practically drowning in mare juice as his mouth opened ever so slightly, accepting a mouthful of musty equine lube into his maw. Jason coughed as it went down his windpipe, that urine-scented goop burning inside his throat and searing the nostrils in his nose as Carmine shared her fiery heat with the human male. Mare cum splashed along Jason’s belly as he it filled his stomach… his reeling mind lost in the sauce as he as he opened his mouth and unthinkingly lapped up even more.<br />
<br />
Emma was shaking, the over-bearing smell of donkey heat suffocating her and drawing her in at the same time! She couldn’t believe she was watching this… her husband getting sexually assaulted by a 600-hundred-pound donkey that had a deep, bestial crush on Jason!<br />
<br />
Her mind was flaring with terror at what she was seeing, but that mist of animal sex drove her to do something truly shameful. Her hands briefly wrestled with the fly of her jeans as she sunk a finger in between her gushing femininity, the ambient mist of equine lust in the air commanding her to add her fragile human scent into the cacophony of bestial pheromones.<br />
<br />
“Flprrrppt… Flrrpp”<br />
<br />
The jenny’s drooling brays sounded along with her wet, meaty queefs as Jason switched modes. His hands weren’t pulling away anymore but tugging her in, his fingers sinking into her ample ass-fat as he made out with Carmine’s feral ass just like he was French kissing a whore in Memphis. His lips nipped at her doughy, feral labia, the man’s tongue growing thicker and longer as it mashed against that winking button of beastly arousal, driving the donkey absolutely mad.<br />
<br />
Carmine started to buck, instincts taking the reins as if they were telling her a stallion was about to mate with her. And she wasn’t wrong either. Jason’s nose sank inside her cunt, huffing up her acrid perfume like cocaine as his mouth merged to form a snout. His lips discolored into a feral black as they gnawed against his new mate’s sex, blocky herbivore teeth completing his maw as he mercilessly muzzle-fucked the mare in front of him.<br />
<br />
Emma’s finger got sopping wet, her pussy juices puddling in her panties as this feral beast stole her husband away. At this point she couldn’t stop Carmine even if she wanted to, the mare growing addicted to the man she loved, giving Jason the ride no human girl could possibly give him. And Jason… he liked it too.<br />
<br />
Those faint pleas from the boy behind the donkey turned into hardy snorts, Jason’s head rolling underneath Carmine even as he was pancaked in donkey ass, lapping away at the donkey’s pussy like Emma remembered him doing during their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
Looking back to that night, Emma would never thought it’d go this way - her one and only crush eagerly committing such a heinous taboo… and she was responsible for it all. Her stud of a husband was growing even more studly by a moment, but in horrible ways! His arms tightened with unnatural muscle, the boy beginning to look like he was on steroids as strands of tendon writhed underneath his skin like parasites, connecting new muscles to new ligaments as his frame grew into one fit for a quadrupedal form.<br />
<br />
Jason’s legs quickly began to stiffen, the transforming man spasming against the intense pressure of his changing leg bending underneath Carmine. He suddenly sprung up, evacuating himself from the jenny’s ass, standing butt to belly behind his new mate as he panted for breath after the hot, gooey ordeal.<br />
<br />
As Emma saw Jason’s face she gasped. Underneath that slimy slough of mare lube, she could see he had deformed, his mouth growing longer with some grey fuzzy sprouting along the extended nose. The boy’s ears started to stretch upward like they were being tugged by invisible hooks; Jason none the wiser to it as his physical form devolved.<br />
<br />
The man looked confused. With his hand planted atop Carmine’s rear, he was gasping for breath as if he were just rescued from drowning. One of his eyes stared at Emma as they splayed to opposite sides of his head, that deep orb peering over at his wife as if to desperately ask her, “What is happening!?”<br />
<br />
“You’re going to be happy!” Emma reassured him in a frantic tone, trembling with lust and fear at the sight of her changing husband as she masturbated herself. She didn’t know what she was doing! She didn’t know how she could have brought herself to do this to the man she loved, but the siren sensations of lust forbidden to humans drew her to comfort her husband. “Y-you’ll finally have girls that can handle sex with you whenever you want! As much as you want! All the time! You’ll be happy forever! And you’ll stay with me too-!”<br />
<br />
Emma’s trembled voice struck a crescendo as a gush of cum splashed from her pink, swollen pussy lips. She returned to looking at her husband with a smile that was teeming with doubt, anxiety and a sordid affection.<br />
<br />
“- forever…!”<br />
<br />
Jason’s mare-cum-drenched maw opened as his eye shook, but his words came out as a garbled mess, a roiling mass of vowels spitting out from his mouth like he’d lost the ability to form English!<br />
<br />
Carmine snorted in frustration as the oral sex suddenly came to a stop. She hammered her rear hard against Jason, the man behind her getting his ass slammed against the wall as more feral musculature trickled down his body. He twitched, trying to pull away from her yet again, but even his own body seemed to be obeying the jenny’s lust, his stance starting to strain and sway, his back bending forward awkwardly as if the only thing keeping him up now was the jenny he was propped up on.<br />
<br />
His flannel shirt and jeans looked awfully tight under that onslaught of new mass, the fabric valiantly trying to hem in Jason’s growth, but was slowly losing the battle. But even if Jason were pants-free, he still wouldn’t be able to give Carmine what she wanted just yet, the tall jenny banging her rear against the man’s belly, his crotch hanging below where she wanted him to be as his groin started to bulge out obnoxiously.<br />
<br />
“Oh…” Emma drooled, the girl coming off as possessed as her glassy eyes looked at her husband’s crotch, the girl transfixed by the transformation occurring down there. She’d always lusted after his size even if her tiny frame couldn’t accept it. Lost in the smell of equine sex, she couldn’t help but wonder how much more awesome his cock was going to be!<br />
<br />
The small woman knelt underneath the jenny, those flabby, ebony donkey udders wavering just above her head as she unzipped her husband’s fly, revealing his white underwear just barely holding in the might of Jason’s erection. She moved in to yank it down, but didn’t have to wait, that over-sized boner suddenly flinging out from the underwear’s elastic hem, slapping Emma in the cheek, sending her sputtering backwards before she could get a good look at it.<br />
<br />
That cock-slap left a slimy kiss of pre-cum on Emma’s cheek, the girl gasping as she caught a blurry glimpse her husband’s cock hanging low. It flexed and bobbed fitfully as it bounced up and down, bloating out in waves to more massive sizes, obscenely adding more girth and length as he husband’s cock began shifting into a stallion’s.<br />
<br />
“Hey b-babe.” Emma smirked as she got on her knees, bowing down in front of her husband, “I-I promised you a blow job, didn’t I?”<br />
<br />
The woman had lost all sense, the small woman seemingly hypnotized by her husband’s irresistible male scent. She wrapped her hand around his shaft, feeling the feral growth rumbling from inside. It was close to a foot-long now, something that’d probably kill her if she tried vaginal sex with it… but it looked so ripe and juicy, she just had to have a taste.<br />
<br />
A puff of lust greeted that glisten pink cock head as Emma held it up to her mouth. She rolled back her husband’s foreskin, marveling at how slick and shiny that pre-covered shaft was as it pulsed with bestial power growing inside. She lapped along the underside, the taste of boy cock alone bringing her close to orgasm, but she tasted even more than just that. Another flavor tasted raunchy, disgusting even... at least at first. It was the foul smell of unwashed donkey, the gooey strands of mare cum still dripping on her husband’s cock as she littered it with her astringent flavor. But it couldn’t be just the jenny’s smell. Jason just smelled so male; aggressively male, ferally male. He was so male that she couldn’t help but lick again and again, the very smell telling her to bow down and worship Jason’s cock as if he were God.<br />
<br />
Jason thrashed and sputtered out hacking, coughing brays as if warning his wife to get away! As much as he tried to get out, he still couldn’t budge, unable to wrest the horny jenny’s muscular ass away from him!<br />
<br />
Emma had to open her mouth as wide as she could to fit her husband’s new size, barely managing to schluck that engorged knob of Jason’s glans inside her maw. She did her best not to nip it with her teeth, but it was so big… so hard… she wrapped her tongue along as much of the lower half as she could while digging her loose hand under her shirt to grope her meagre breasts, breasts could never come close to comparing to Carmine’s udders.<br />
<br />
Emma knew she was garbage at oral, but this was heaven. Jason’s scent grew harsher and more domineering as she just knelt there stuffed with his flaring cock meat in her maw, feeling that fat rod of masculinity growing huge, the tip squashing between her palette and tongue until it grew so massive it was threatening to dislocate her jaw!<br />
<br />
She awoke from her sex-induced stupor as the pain started to hit. Realizing her peril, Emma tried to use both hands to pry his cock out… but it was stuck! She got nervous, hands pulling that dick back and forth desperately until she got more than she bargained for! The shaft engorged, his urethra fattening into a thick tube along the underside of Jason’s cock as she felt a hot glob flow down her husband’s urethra like molten magma.<br />
<br />
There was no time to prepare, she realized what it was just a moment before impact. Emma closed her eyes and clamped her lips around that cock as she braced herself!<br />
<br />
It felt like being waterboarded. In a mere moment Emma’s mouth went from stuffed with cock to a geyser of sperm, steaming hot jizz erupting from her lips and nose as the other half blasted down her throat. She hacked up jizz, almost passing out as that enrapturing scent of unadulterated maleness pacified the girl like a chloroform-soaked rag. Her muscles relaxed as her insides were bathed in sperm, the girl feeling that cock jump another inch in length inside her maw as it bashed against the back of her throat.<br />
<br />
Jason’s panicked whinnies and jerky motions turned into thrusting as his wife blow-jobbed urged the feral part of his mind to mate! His shoes clattered against the barn floor as the rubber soles twisted, sheering at the force of something powerful growing within. A pair of dark hooves burst out of his shoes as if they were a cocoon, each hoof shifting wider than Emma’s head as they pattered incessantly against the floor.<br />
<br />
Jason’s voice hollered in a twisted cry of bliss, his virility starting to trump reason! He bashed his cock forward again and again with his new anatomy starting to give him leverage. The stitching of his jean snapped free as loose strands of denim shred away, revealing long, boney equine legs connected to Olympic-sized haunches! <br />
<br />
Jason’s harsh beast musk grew stronger in Emma’s head as his body swiftly lost any resemblance to the man she fell in love with. Her mouth was reaching critical capacity as that cock plunged deeper, Jason’s smell amping up as sweaty donkey flesh covered his human skin. The sickly-sexy aroma of barnyard beast musk mixed with Jason’s maleness utterly knocked her out, the girl collapsing backward as the force of gravity let that super-sized member jerk free from her agape maw!<br />
<br />
Emma lay gasping on the wooden floor under the Jenny as the mare above her whinnied and whined, the smell of cum sending her into a frenzy as she kept squashing her husband against her giant ass. Even though the cock was free of her mouth, Jason kept cumming, molten-hot sperm flaring out all over her body in thick ropes, burying her in a slimy white coating of cum!<br />
<br />
Emma couldn’t bring herself to move, melting at the feeling of her husband’s gargantuan loads dumping out liters of sperm all over her body. She couldn’t adjust to it, her mind unable to process feeling and taste and smell as the Jenny above her whirred frantically in jealousy. To keep grasp of Carmine, Jason’s arms crackled and bulked up like he’d done ten thousand rip-curls, his hand creaking into solid black hooves as they scraped against the haughty jenny’s belly.<br />
<br />
As Jason shifted further, his cum kept flowing. It took over a minute for that burst of cum to exhaust itself. Emma managed to right herself on her knees, feeling dizzy and ditzy as man-musk still had its hold on her, controlling her like some sort of marionette. She got up one her knees until she was face-to-face with her husband’s cock tip, watching wide-eyed as an oozing fountain of sperm kept drooling from that over-sized tip.<br />
<br />
Jason’s flared glans that had just been locked in Emma’s mouth wasn’t at all human any longer. It was starting to darken a lot, the pinkish tip fading into a deep, almost brownish red as the discoloration traveled further down his shaft. Jason’s glans looked like it was breathing, bobbing up and down as the urethra widened, the back of the cock head growing and standing on edge as it fattened up even more with rubbery donkey flesh. His cock head was now the diameter of a baseball and rapidly growing even more inhuman, but still Emma couldn’t pry herself away from it. She licked her lips at the musky black skin, bending in to kiss her husband’s dick yet again as she lapped at that urethra, feeding on more of Jason’s kids.<br />
<br />
“His kids.” Emma shivered, lapping at that bobbing cock tip as it fattened into something utterly beast-like. That flesh looked like it had always been equine, Emma recalling that that soft, lotion-like boy cock Jason used to have was utterly and completely gone now. He was losing himself fast, yet she realized he was still drooling human sperm… but he wouldn’t be for long.<br />
<br />
Reality hit Emma like a brick as she realized she forgot something unbelievable important! She managed to pull herself away, thick strands of semen stringing between her and Jason’s donkey dick. She wanted to have kids with Jason so badly, but that window was closing… his changing cock portending his jizz would change too very soon. Panic stirred inside her like a whirlwind as she pulled back, realizing that this… this would be it – her last chance!<br />
<br />
She’d eaten it, drank it, rubbed it all over her body! It was the last of his children, his balls now spurting out the remainder of his humanity before they changed irrevocably into a donkey’s. Emma just didn’t know what to do! Should she grab a bucket and collect it and try to inseminate herself later? Should she try to reverse the transformation, just so he could impregnate her with a manageable cock before he starts his new life as a farm animal?<br />
<br />
Her thoughts raced. She didn’t have any time! He could be making nothing but donkey sperm at any second! In a desperate move she turned around and tugged her jeans down, revealing her pert little ass to that oozing tip of donkey pride, wishing she would have planned better!<br />
<br />
Jason whinnied as his wife tried to impale herself on his super-sized dick, that fat, rubbery flare battering his wife’s throbbing pussy lips, smearing a fat, gooey bead of cum all over her sex. The slap made Emma’s spine shake, the girl paralyzed against her husband’s donkey cock for a few seconds before she could get the wherewithal to reach and hand back and try to force it in!<br />
<br />
Emma could hardly grasp that cock head in her hand now! It was huge, squishy yet strong at the same time, the cummy sheen covering it making it slip from her fingers over and over again as she thrust herself back against it. She barely managed to pinch onto the blackened edge of that donkey flare squeezing that thinner portion of skin in her grasp as she swiftly glid that baseball bat sized cock to her tiny pussy.<br />
<br />
Throwing consequences to the wind, she squashed that prehensile flare against her cunt, feeling it blast a numbingly hot glob of semen, the seed squishing against her like hot glue as she kept trying to swab her husband’s dick inside a hole it was no longer meant for. Even though that rubbery donkey flesh was extremely wet and squishy, she felt like her pussy was burning as that overload of bestial meat started to squish inside her, forced along by her braying husband’s careless thrusting!<br />
<br />
“JASON!! OH, JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!”, Emma screamed, almost drowning in the viscous mixture of sperm and drool sloshing in her moaning maw. It must have been what giving birth felt like but the opposite way around, the black equine dick she was trying to jam inside her cunt bigger than any baby any woman ever gave birth to!<br />
<br />
Jason stomped a hoof against the ground as he wheezed out a blurred whinny, Carmine braying in unison as the almost-animal’s body flexed larger, his groin starting to move upward as his feet and body stretched underneath the clattering of growing vertebrae. Jason’s pants had long-since ripped into strands, his underwear still ardently clutching his fattening waist as the bulbous outline of two asinine testicles ballooned against the underside of that thin strip of fabric.<br />
<br />
“AHHH-auughh—AUUGHH!” Emma bellowed, vividly feeling every millimeter of that feral glans as her husband-turned-beast pounded away at her swollen cunt as if it belonged to Carmine! The human’s most sensual spot, the silky-soft, pink inner walls of her birth canal were being defiled by molten hot donkey dick. Emma’s clit was grinding against the donkey’s piss hole as she rode out a chain of orgasms, girl cum mixing in with Jason’s feral jizz as it helped to lube up that monster of a dick to defile her even more. The stallion slammed his dick forward hard, sperm spewing out the woman’s cunt as that flared dick abruptly disappeared into her stuffed pussy lips!<br />
<br />
Jason’s hips pounded with wanton abandon against his wife as darkening donkey flesh finished blanketing every inch of Jason’s cock in an inhuman black. The shape became indistinguishable from that of an animal as Jason’s body ready flared out with a blaze of equine mass above her. In an instant his underwear slingshot off his bulging hips, those gargantuan balls flopping free, battering obnoxiously against Jason’s muscular thighs as they bloated with a must have been a tub-full of cum!<br />
<br />
Emma couldn’t process her husband’s changes finally finishing, it was just so hard to think about at this point! Her words turned into babbling drool as her cognitive thoughts sank no deeper than her husband’s. Jason’s bulge was visible underneath his wife’s flesh, Emma’s groin stretching around that bestial mass in a tight hug as it tried to hold it inside without tearing! Carmine stomped and whinnied all the while, the intense reek of sex driving her mad as Emma’s shoulders pressed against her front hooves, locking the girl in place.<br />
<br />
With one more loud bray from Jason, Emma sensed another ominous jerk from that giant dick inside her, his piss hole dilating yet again as it emptied a tar-like slick of yellow-white sperm right inside her! Whether it was human sperm or donkey sperm, she didn’t know, she didn’t care! It gut-punched her cervix as her insides got filled up in mere seconds. Jizz seeped into her uterus, ovaries drenching with the stuff, as she felt those little swimmers attack her eggs, drowning her deepest depths with that searing hot warmth!<br />
<br />
Emma’s pussy couldn’t hold anymore! That jet of cum loosened her swollen labia’s grasp on that head of donkey dick until the flare burst out in a flood of animal seed. Sperm gushed out of his wife’s stretched out hole like a bucket filled with glue had just tipped over. All the while, Jason’s donkey dick just kept bobbing and leaking more dribbles of cum above his wife’s butt until the ornery jenny above Emma began thrashing and squealing, signaling she just couldn’t be ignored anymore!<br />
<br />
The donkey mare was losing it, steam puffing from her nostrils as her head whipped up in the air, pussy juices oozing from her cunt. Jason’s cock whipped up and lashed Carmine’s vaginal lips with his flared cock head, the two giant beasts wrestling back and forth as the stallion fought to fuck his mare!<br />
<br />
Emma had almost fallen unconscious, her head resting in a puddle of donkey sperm as that harsh, acrid maleness bathed her lips in male, mind-rotting bliss. She slowly came too and rolled out from underneath the rowdy animals, crumpling up on the floor a dozen feet away as she admired her husband’s powerful new form. He seemed agitated though, all that effort used on his wife leaving that massive dick of his floppy and flaccid.<br />
<br />
“Hold on…” Emma sputtered, her mouth still glazed with a sheen of donkey cum. She picked Jason’s phone off the ground and turned down a slider named “refractory period”, wanting to give her horny husband all the fun he could ever want! Right as she made the adjustment, Jason’s balls visibly bloat with cum once more as his 26-inch donkey boner rose to the occasional underneath his mare, that bloated black organ smacking against the donkey mare’s udders before he reeled back on top of her and stabbed away at Carmine’s backside.<br />
<br />
The jenny squealed, bucking and braying wildly as her tail flagged frantically, guiding the stallion to her quivering donkey cunt. Hose-like squirts of precum glazed the mare’s rear, soaking her fur until it was matted just before finally hitting his mark, plunging into a female that would never disappoint him.<br />
<br />
Emma felt the impact, biting her lip as she curled up into a ball in the puddle of donkey semen, watching her partner bash into the mare’s rear with one full horsepower of force. The beast below him brayed out in bliss as she matched his thrust, slamming back against him as the two became one, loft in a heavy mating embrace.<br />
<br />
The weight of what she had done slowly set in, yet Emma couldn’t bring herself to mourn the loss of her husband as he was. Jason had turned into a blue-ribbon head of livestock, the avatar of a perfect donkey stud! She didn’t know what she ever doubted it – why she hadn’t done this even sooner. Jason was better as a donkey, God probably wanted to him to be one but messed up and made him human. But it was fine. There was nothing to worry about anymore. The app would ensure no one remember Jason the human, and the reality alteration would supply her with all his pedigree papers as if her were born an animal!<br />
<br />
As that squealing pitch of donkey fucking grew into a feverous climax, Emma couldn’t help but wonder how much of Jason was still left in the stallion. Was his soul a donkey’s now, and if he’d die, would he go to donkey heaven or wherever animals go? She felt a flood of emotions fill her as she realized she may have corrupted her husband’s very soul into that of an animal’s, guilt and excitement sending a shiver down her cum-stuffed belly. Either way, he’s happy now, and he’s hers. That’s all she ever wanted.<br />
<br />
Emma closed her eyes, falling asleep to the gushing sound of cum spilling onto the floor beneath them, listening to the strong female snort and bray as she withstood every ounce of her husband&#39;s new feral strength.<br />
<br />
Carmine was so lucky, Emma wished she was her.</p>
