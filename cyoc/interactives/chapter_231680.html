<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tallying what Solrss felt Avram owed him so far... some gold for the puzzle that at this point was just Zoe&#39;s, and a favor that would probably be used for instruction... He wandered to Zoe&#39;s room confused as to why there was only a lock on the outside. It was afternoon and he figured he should at least fetch Zoe for lunch since he didn&#39;t notice some barely expressive human making insane leaps of logic in a puzzle box. When he opened the door... fleshy breasts greeted his view... also the rest of Zoe behind them. Zoe just kinda glanced at Solrss and asked &quot;Umm... do you know how to cancel an enchantment?&quot; <br />
Solrss was a hot blooded Draco, they like the feel of scales on scales and were somewhere between reptile and mammal... that said they had mammal parts like the females developing breasts and something akin to milk but not quite. The breasts were also usually smaller than humans thus most Dracos tended to feel weird when human men seemed to be so engrossed with the body part. That also said Dracos were not immune, especially when they were exposed bare in a supposedly intimate setting. The first part of ruining an enchantment was to either cut/disrupt the magic which when put on something physical usually meant destroying or at least chipping or destroying it... considering the physic thing was Zoe Solrss considered that not an option. So he had to take a look at the magic book... The particular spell that Zoe had cast... Solrss got the gist of. You put a certain rune on or near a body part and it would swell to a larger size usually burying the rune inside the flesh as the swelling would grow over the magic. This could make it more covert... or in Zoe&#39;s case invisible as the modest breasted human now had her breasts laying on her lap when sitting down. <br />
Solrss spoke &quot;Theoretically I could break the enchantment... If I could access the rune... which is currently buried a foot into your chest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Think Avram could do it?&quot; Zoe asked innocently<br />
&quot;Yes Miss, but... would you want Him to see you like that?&quot; Solrss asked wondering what exactly Zoe thought of him? Some sort weird animal thing? Human-centrist bigotry at it&#39;s finest, but Solrss wasn&#39;t complaining yet. &quot;I think you can just wait out the enchantment&quot; Solrss took another look at the book and if she did the spell right... the description said that it should only last an hour, although you could modify it. So Solrss had to take it on himself to get Zoe some lunch. When he came back Zoe was reading from that perverted tome again. Which meant it was Solrss job to put food in her mouth as she was absorbed into those naughty spells. When she stopped nibbling on whatever he put in front of Zoe Solrss stopped and then examined the state of the room. A chalk board was chalked with all sorts of hints, mage ink was drawn everywhere with initial observations and ideas. Solrss went up to the fourth shelf of a bookcase, dragged his claw down the books till he found a &quot;Dire Diagnosis of [Dagger Disintegration]&quot; and then pulled it out slightly as the false bookcase pulled outward revealing a hidden compartment at which seemed like a closet of some sort.<br />
&quot;WHAT DID YOU DO!?!&quot; Zoe asked confused and interested. She hadn&#39;t found ANY clues yet about the bookshelf... she just thought she&#39;d find one eventually. <br />
&quot;Small Draco tradition when making a hidden room with a bookcase. the 4th shelf from either the top of the bottom will contain a book with 4 letters starting with D. The book is usually a decoy, but a few authors made their titles to fit this little tradition of ours.&quot; Solrss said &quot;The tradition spread to other species, usually with some amount of rule changing. I just tried this out as a hunch... whoever made this room may have been a Draco...&quot; <br />
Zoe looked infuriated as she said &quot;So a riddle in an escape room where the answer lays outside...&quot;<br />
&quot;An Escape... you mean a room that merely exists as all sorts of puzzles that you have to solve before you can get out?&quot; Solrss thought for a second about the lock on the outside. &quot;You&#39;re a bit infuriating in a way you know? Like why are you focusing on THAT spell book of all things!?!&quot; <br />
Zoe could&#39;ve said &quot;I get an XP bonus, and I want to level fast.&quot; what she said was &quot;I&#39;m an [Enchanter] and that book has a lot of Enchantments. I just learned how to make a body bigger in certain ways. I&#39;m sure I can use that knowledge and apply it to other things... like muscles or a plant...&quot;<br />
Solrss furrowed his &quot;brow&quot; and said &quot;Theoretically that&#39;s possible, but...&quot; then he looked at the girl whose only limiting factor on the puzzle box was her actual magical power. Solrss was seeing why Avram wanted someone to take care of Zoe. She probably would become an amazing [Enchanter] who pushed everyone forward with her theories... it&#39;s just he REALLY didn&#39;t want to take care of her personally. Zoe&#39;s breasts had reduced back in size as the magic of her enchantment faded... The girl&#39;s shirt had not spontaneously went back to normal so Solrss said &quot;Just go in there and get a mage&#39;s robe or something.&quot; That was when Solrss had a thought. The mage who made this room had spent a considerable amount of time making puzzles ontop of puzzles and they were probably a really good one. Even if there were just spare clothes in there they&#39;d probably better than he had on. In fact Zoe currently was starting to put on a mage&#39;s robe that was inside a glass case that felt like it was telling her to put them on... alongside a pair of glasses on a manikin&#39;s head. Putting them on was a puzzle in itself, but was worth it as putting it on gave Zoe just a fuzzy feeling inside. The robe would radiate whoever had worn it with a minor overdose of mana to help increase their mana well, along with keeping the temperature of the wearer regulated, the robe had a repair and cleaning function built in, etc. The glasses Zoe saw let her see shimmerings and whatnot... as if she could see the mana in the air, and maybe some hidden runes? Solrss was rather upset that he got nothing... although he supposed he solved what was barely even a puzzle. <br />
<br />
Zoe eventually succumbed to sleep after having spent some time on the horny book, some time on the beginner magic book she found, and the room as a whole. Some progress was made on all accounts, but she was beginning to feel her lack of fundamentals blocking her progress in actually learning [spells] and this whole room had a lot of puzzles that were obviously solvable with the right [spell] that she just didn&#39;t have... time for some [horny] training she supposed as she made her more private parts larger... she wondered as her clit enlarged whether this was what boys felt as she &quot;flicked the bean&quot; by rubbing it. <br />
<br />
[Class consolidation]: [Puzzle Enchanter] + [Pervert Initiate] -> [P.P. Enchanter] <br />
[P.P. Enchanter] Level up: 9<br />
Skill obtained: [Enchantment Duration: Redefine] <br />
Bound Spell obtained: [Change Species] <br />
<br />
Zoe understood that by P.P. the thing meant Puzzle and Pervert... but the pun also wasn&#39;t lost on her... also maybe she&#39;d end up enchanting Solrss&#39; PP at some point.</p>
