<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John took out a bottle from the basket. On it, there was a label that read, &quot;get heavier, but only works with food.  <br />
&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; John muttered, &quot;I'll take this one to dinner tonight.  It's fortunate that Carrie said she'd treat us all to dinner the first night we would be here.  <br />
<br />
John put it in his pant pocket and left the room.  Then, Carrie came out of the bathroom and said,<br />
&quot;Okay, I want to treat the both of you to dinner at a nice, mexican restaurant that Mr. Haymouth pointed out to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to let me come along too&quot; Cliff said, half wanting to kick himself for saying that, for he hadn't had a nice meal in a long time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense!&quot; Carrie said, &quot;You can tag along too.  We won't mind, will we John?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, no promblem at all&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Cliff said.  So they rented a car and drove to the restaurant.  When they arrived, and were seated at the table, John told Carrie what he wanted to order and then went to the Mens Room.  There, he took out the bottle and looked at the label for some more information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo&quot; John whispered inside one of the stalls, &quot;the label says that as long as eat within 30 minutes after I drink it, the effect will still take place.&quot;  So John took the lid off and drunk a few drops.  Then he put the lid back on and went back to the table.  The food was already there so Carrie and Cliff were already eating.  John took some food on his plate.  As he looked at the food, a strange feeling was inside his stomach. Then, for some reason or another, John felt the urge to just eat as much as possible.  He went on a eating frenzy.  He just finished his fifth plate full of food when another tray of food came (half of the plate had beans on it; hint, hint).  Then John scraped half of the tray's food onto his plate.  Then he ate it all in just 3 minutes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ar-are you feeling alright, John?&quot; Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, just fine&quot; John replied, &quot;I was just a little hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Carrie continued, &quot;did anything happen?  You haven't eaten this much food before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmph,&quot; Cliff murmered to himself, I think I know what happened&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say something, Cliff?&quot; Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no&quot; Cliff said, &quot;nothing, nothing at all...&quot;  Cliffs mind just got side tracked by John's last bite, and the small, but definitely showing, paunch that John had suddenly created for himself.  <br />
<br />
Carrie payed the bill and they left the restaurant.  John and Carrie dropped Cliff off at his house and then went back to the hotel.  There, they went straight to sleep.<br />
<br />
In the morning, John woke to see a note on the door that lead to the hallway.  The note said, &quot;I've left for the mall to do some shopping.  I'll be back by 5:00 p.m.&quot;.  John looked over at the clock on the wall.  It was 11:00 a.m., so John got dressed and decided to go see Cliff.  When he put his jeans on, he found that he could not button them together.  He tried and tried.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I must've gained some weight&quot; John thought to himself.  Then he went to look at himself in the bathroom mirror.  The reflection showed that he was still his thin, old self.  &quot;Thats odd&quot; John said.  He then took off his jeans and put on his sweat pants, even though it was still difficult.  He put on his coat to only find he couldn't zip it up either.  Then he decided to forget about trying to zip it up and left to go see Cliff.  &quot;My shirt is also too small for me too&quot; John said as he felt the breeze go against a bit of his skin that was showing through his shirt.  <br />
<br />
John didn't know it, but it was the potion that was causing this to happen, for he was slowly ballooning up with fat again.  The mirror didn't show this because the potion made it so that no reflection would reflect his true form.  As John climbed the steps up to the 3rd floor of the treminal bulding, John's stomach inflated again, but not enough for John to really notice.  His stomach was as round as half a beachball now.  When Cliff saw him, he didn't mention it to him.  Instead, he said hello and gave him a beer and some nachos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; John said.  Then he talked with Cliff about what had happened until he notice he had no more to eat or drink.  5 seconds passed and then John felt a pain in his stomach.  &quot;I feel soooooooooo full!&quot; John moaned.  Then he started to inflate again, but this time, it didn't stop and John noticed it.  His arms and legs developed folds of fat and his stomach looked as round as a beachball that had been blown up too much.  Then an incredible pressure built within him.  The pressure stopped, and all of a sudden, &quot;BURRRRRRRRAAAAAP!   FAAAART!&quot;  John let go a screeching belch and enormous fip snorting fart.  Then John's inflation stopped, and John began to shrink.  20 seconds after he was back to his normal state, John started to blow up again.  His pants became so tight that they burst off, revealing poka-dotted boxers.  Then, his shirt began to tear.  Within seconds, it came off.  His arms and legs looked like folds of jellatine.  His legs looked like 3 pumpkins each that were stacked on eachother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helllllllp... MMMEEEEEEE!&quot; John gasped as the inflation continued.</p>
