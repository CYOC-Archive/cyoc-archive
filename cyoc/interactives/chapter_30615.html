<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Loki walked down the street passing the kids in the street and gave the teen mowing the lawn a friendly nod.  As he turned the corner he could hear the teen curse as the mower suddenly shut off and refused to start again.<br />
<br />
The Loki didn't know where to start so many potential victims so much fun to be had, but he wanted to start easy find someone alone then he saw it.  There behind a house was a adolescent boy sleeping on a chair by the pool.  Looking at the garage the Loki guessed his parents weren't at home.  As the Loki walked up the the sleeping teen the Loki began to shrink till he looked about the age of twelve<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh what?&quot; the kid said waking up<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; Loki said<br />
&quot;Scram kid I'm sleeping&quot; the teen said pushing the Loki away<br />
&quot;Nice whiskers.&quot; The Loki said doing his best child impression<br />
&quot;Leave me alone kid!&quot; the teen said laying back down and closing his eyes not noticing the thick white whiskers growing from his upper lip.<br />
&quot;Why are you sleeping, you should be having fun.&quot; Loki says tugging the kids shirt.<br />
&quot;Go the fuck away!&quot; the teen says getting up and chasing the Loki off the property.<br />
<br />
The teen walked back to his chair and lied back down kicking his shoes off failing to notice that four of his toes had vanished leaving him with three each.  The teen wiggled his toes as his nails grew dark and pointed.  The teen scratched his chest through his shirt that lifts slightly as a thick pelt of tightly packed brown hair started to spread from between his pectorals and down his back enveloping most of his body.  The Loki had crept back to the slumbering boy as the boys body began to expand as muscle packed itself on.  The boy stretched in reflex and seeing the opportunity his ribcage shrank becoming more compact giving more flexibility and a longer abdomen, but his pectorals shrank to fit the new ribcage.<br />
<br />
The teen let out a load yawn opening his mouth wide revealing a set of   sharp pearly white teeth.  Yawning again his eyes opened and he stood up, he walked a few steps before he noticed his nose looked funny. Touching his face with his hands he felt his upper lip swell and push out slightly, and then he saw his hands.   His middle and ring fingers had started to fuse together and his skin was turning a dark brown.  His fingers webbed and his nails thickened and pointed becoming claws.  panicking he turned around and saw the Loki child staring at him.   He was about to ask for help when he heard a ripping sound.  his sleeves had become skin tight, but with the narrowing of his torso the bottom half hung like drapes, but the ripping sound came from below his shorts had already started to give out and closing his eyes and gritting his teeth a lump formed at the back of his pants before it burst and a thick otter's tail slowly grew from the hole.<br />
<br />
As the last of the changes occurred a smell wafted into his dark triangular nose, it smelled almost like...<br />
&quot;Fish!&quot; the anthro otter boy said diving toward the smell.  <br />
<br />
The former human teen dived into the pool and swam though the water at miraculous speed and caught a fish in his mouth.  Swimming to the edge of the water he curled up on a rock and gnawed on the raw fish with a smile on his face.<br />
&quot;See your having fun now!&quot; Loki said to the previously human teen.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; he said looking up from his fish suddenly realizing he was no longer in a pool in his backyard. &quot;Where am I?  What did you do to me?&quot; he continued suddenly realizing that he was no longer dreaming<br />
&quot;Helping you have fun!&quot;  Loki said turning back from a child into a adult.<br />
&quot;How are you helping me?  I'm a freak now!&quot; He yelled looking around realizing he was in a very large cage<br />
&quot;Look kid, I'm just plain crazy.  Having godlike powers kind of goes to your head, and it doesn't help that I have ADD, your lucky I didn't get distracted halfway though the transformation leaving you a fourth otter and three fourths human.&quot; Loki said playing his hand on the glass<br />
&quot;You can't do this!  I had a life!  I never had kids!  You have no right!&quot; the anthro otter boy yelled pounding on the glass<br />
&quot;Well then I'm sorry to say your the only of your species I've ever made, and I don't want to help birth no babies so its a no on getting you a female otter girl, but I might be able to catch you a guy if thats your fancy...&quot; the Loki said smiling as the otter glared at him &quot;I'll take that as a no, but if you ever get desperate just ask&quot; he laughed &quot;Who knows girls these days are into some really weird things so you may get lucky.  In the mean time theres lots of fish and water and I'll give you some time alone to figure out just how flexible otters are.&quot; the Loki said winking as a plaque appeared on the glass with the words 'Otter-Boy, Lutrinae Sapien, Do not pet he bites'<br />
<br />
Loki walked away from his new pet who was pounding the glass in what little remained of his clothing, and walked out of the woods where he hid the tank from prying eyes.  Leaving the forest the Loki walked back to the neighborhood and wondered who should be next</p>
