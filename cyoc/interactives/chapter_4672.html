<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then I suddenly began to feel very strange all over. It was like someone had come over to me at this moment and pour a small tub of warm water all over me. For I felt a roll of warm energy flowing away from the shoulder where I was injected with the dart and into every cell of my body. It was a pleasing kind of warmth, the kind where you just want to do nothing but savor it and relax. I sighed and briefly closed my eyes as the warmth continued to pour and swirl itself into me. <br />
<br />
I then opened up my eyes and looked up at the zoo employee. I smiled, he was such a good person and I found myself wanting to be his best friend. I wanted to be by his side where he went. I wanted to live where he lived and enjoy his company. These feelings I felt for my friend here grew and grew as I crawled on my hands and knees to him. And with these feelings the roll of warm energy in my body also began to build and build toward a climax that I was looking very much forward to. <br />
<br />
As I stopped before my friend, the zoo employee, the feelings I had for him and the roll of warm energy reached its’ climax. My skin began to feel hot and itchy all over. My breath quickened as I looked up at my friend and imagined the time we would spend together. The hot, itchy feeling wasn’t bothersome and I found that I could ignore it. But as I found myself ignoring that discomfort, I felt a pressure building up behind my nose and mouth and at my hips. This new discomfort I could not ignore and I wanted to tear myself from admiring my friend albeit reluctantly to see what was making me uncomfortable. My friend distracted me with a whistle from his lips. I looked back at him to see that he was holding something tasty in his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit. Sit.&quot; He told me in a stern but kind voice as he held the tasty treat above my head. <br />
<br />
I did as he told me too by pushing myself back into a squatting position next to him. My friend smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. You are good boy. And for being one, I am going to give you this treat.&quot; He said nicely to me.<br />
<br />
He lowered his hand till it was level with my head. I politely then reached over to his hand and snatched the treat out of it and wolfed it down. And not only did the treat that my friend gave me looked tasty, it smelled and tasted very good. Another surge of that warm pleasing roll of energy went right through me and made my skin hotter and itchier. But it also brought me more pleasure and happy feelings toward my friend. And the pressure I was feeling from behind my nose and mouth and from my hips eased as something stretched itself out. Looking past the thing that stretched outward from my face, I saw my friend smile. He reached down to me with his hand and massaged my head briefly with it. More pleasure and happy feelings came as my breath quickened even more. I really wanted to be with my friend now. <br />
<br />
Still looking up at my friend, I watched him pull a pocket knife from his shirt pocket and move himself around to my backside. I wanted to get up and turn around to see what he was doing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just stay where you are. Stay!&quot; He told me once again in the stern yet kind voice. And I did as he said so. <br />
<br />
My friend then lowered himself till he was leaning over my back. And then he began to use his pocket knife to cut away my T-shirt. I felt glad that my friend was taking it off of me, it was getting uncomfortable just wearing it. Within moments what was left of my T-shirt feel to the ground in front of my hands. My friend then got up again and walked around me to where I could see him again. He pulled another tasty treat from somewhere on his body and was offering to me it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand boy, stand.&quot; He told me. <br />
<br />
I stretched myself out again and pushed myself up to where I was standing on my hands and feet. My hands and feet felt strange but I quickly dismissed that thought as my friend smiled at me again and proffered me that treat. I wolfed that one down like the first and sighed as it seemingly reinforced the pleasure and feelings I was experiencing. My friend then told me to stay again as he walked behind me. I felt him this time removing those uncomfortable pants I was wearing. It took him longer to remove my pants like he did with my shirt but soon they were on the ground with what was left of my T-shirt. For a moment I felt a bit strange by the fact that even though I was naked, I still felt like I was wearing a hot, itchy sweater. But that thought didn’t last long as my friend walked back to where I could see him. I looked up at him with love and admiration. I smiled a toothy smile at him and he smiled back to show how pleased he was with me. He then got me to sit again for him by offering me another of those tasty treats. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, you are becoming a very good boy.&quot; He told me approvingly. &quot;Despite what you did just a few moments ago with your fellow canine, you are turning out to be a fine looking and obedient German Shepherd dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled at him again and knew without looking down at myself, that my friend was right. I was a handsome and obedient German Shepherd dog. And I knew that I wanted very much to be his German Shepherd dog. The thought of being his pet pleased me very much. I panted contentedly as my friend then presented me a token of his friendship, my very own dog collar. I sniffed at it and then watched him place it around my neck. And with a click, it was on and I was his. I was his dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Max, good boy. I just know that you are going to like being here at the Petting Zoo.&quot; He kindly told. &quot;And you know something else, Max?&quot;<br />
<br />
I cocked my head at his question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might just ask my boss to take you home with me as my pet. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
I got up onto all fours, barked a happy bark at my friend and wagged my tail to show him how much I wanted him to. I wanted to go home with him and be his pet dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it is settled Max, I am taking you home with me at the end of my shift. You are going to be my pet dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
I let off some happy woofs and barks at my friend and then I moved toward him to get some of his affection. And as he patted me and stroked his hands across my furry back, a lingering thought that was strange to think of popped into my head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was this their idea of punishment for violating that sign I saw? Or was this their idea of a reward?&quot;<br />
<br />
But then the thought disappeared and I forgot about it as I went back to being a happy and friendly German Shepherd dog for my friend.</p>
