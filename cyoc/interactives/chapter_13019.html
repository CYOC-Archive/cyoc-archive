<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was overcome by excitement. He jumped up to the landing between the stairs, still wearing only his boxers, and peered out of the window. &quot;thank god&quot; he said &quot;she's not home&quot;. Jeff's sister's car was missing. &quot;Maybe she'll be back?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasted no time, and rushed up the stairs, passing the living room, and down the hall. No one.<br />
<br />
He hurried into the bathroom and shut the door. he pushed the lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God!&quot; he exclaimed upon looking at himself. Rarely had he ever seen such a hairy man shirtless, now, that was him! His chest was a swirling mass of dark hair, hair all up and down his stomach. He brushed his hands across his body. This was too strange, just moments ago he had very little body hair, now he was about as hairy as guys get. <br />
<br />
His Beard! it was wild, seeing himself was like looking at another person, he felt oddly detached, as if he was staring at someone else. But he knew that was him, he could look down and see just how hairy he was. but the beard! it was huge! probably three inches long, completely covering his chin, neck, jawline, mouth, the sides of his face. In fact, Jeff noticed how high his beard went up the sides of his face, it had grown well up his cheeks. <br />
<br />
Jeff stared at his face for a while, so much hair, his eyebrows even, so much thicker. <br />
<br />
He began opening the cabinets looking for a razor, looking for something. In the first cabinate he found some old shaving cream, probably left there by his brother. He pulled that out, and soon began to search the drawers. Luckily for him, the second drawer contained a sack of new razors, all unopened, plastic razors. <br />
<br />
Jeff began the process of shaving off his beard. He had no idea where to start... His neck, maybe? his massive sideburns? He decided to start where the beard thinned out, right up by his cheek bones. He gently applied the shaving cream, and then slowly began shaving. <br />
<br />
It was difficult, as the hair grew thicker and longer as it moved down, but he managed to cut his beard back down to the end of his jaw line on both sides, leaving a funny bare patch on both sides of his face. Jeff cut them back, but left his sideburns in place. <br />
<br />
He slowly worked away, cutting back the long hairs from their base, a very tedious chore, and the poor razor kept getting clogged, and the sink was filled with a mass of hair, But Jeff kept at it, as long and slow as it was, and even a little painful... It was his first shave, and quite a great task for his first time. <br />
<br />
A little bit later and Jeff had cleared the forest off of his face, now leaving a huge mass of hair under his chin and on his neck. It looked odd, seeing his normal, same old face with the alterations: thicker eyebrows and a huge mass of uneven stubble... Not to mention his massive and strange neck-beard. He began attacking at his neck. He moved even more carefully with the razor, afraid of cutting himself. <br />
<br />
Moving his hand along the hair was a bizarre sensation, one he wasn’t used to, by any means. <br />
<br />
Time passed, and Jeff was now down shaving towards the base of the neck. Most all of the hair cleared from the middle of his neck onwards. Jeff wondered how far he should shave, something he hadn’t thought about until now. Should he go all the way down to his chest?  should he leave that thick patch of hair and the base of  his neck? Hair joined his facial hair to his chest, and he wasn’t sure where to stop shaving.<br />
<br />
He decided at the end of his neck to stop. But it took time to rid himself of all that excess hair. He didn’t think about how he'd have to shave 180 degrees around his neck. There was a lot more to be shaved than he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m done!&quot; he exclaimed, staring at his new, stubbly reflection in the mirror. He now recognized himself, but his reflection was very changed. He could clearly see where he had stopped shaving. The thick mass of hair at the base of the neck would show, even when wearing most of his tee shirts. He didn’t mind it though, he felt more manly with all this hair.<br />
<br />
The house was still silent, so washed the remaining hair down the sink, put his razor away, and opened the door. Still only in his boxers, it would be still be an odd situation if anyone would find Jeff. He hadn’t been this hairy before, so it'd be odd to see him so transformed in such a small amount of time.<br />
<br />
As he casually walked down the hallway, into the living room, he heard a car pull up. &quot;oh shit!&quot; Jeff was caught off gaurd, and the noise surprised him. He ran down the stairs to the landing, giving a quick glace out the window. It was his brother's car pulling up.... &quot;Jason’s home&quot; he mumbled under his breath. He then jumped down the remaining steps and rushed to his room, slamming the door. <br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t know what to do... he stood there in the privacy of his room for a second when he heard the front door open and then close, loudly. <br />
<br />
Nervous, Jeff ran over to his dresser and pulled out a tight shirt with a high collar. He managed to pull it on. &quot;ok, good&quot; he said quietly, and went over to the mirror. Hair was still visible on his face, stubble covering it... AND some hair had managed to push out over the top of his shirt. &quot;Gaaah&quot; he said quietly, frustrated. His legs were still bare, and unusually hairy, but Jeff didn’t give it much thought.<br />
<br />
the Chronovac was still on.... just sitting there.<br />
<br />
Then Jeff heard something...</p>
