<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tai was more than happy to move to college since it meant getting away from his family. Sure he loved his parents but it felt more like an obligation because he was the only child. The son born to pass on the family name. The son born to continue the bloodline. The son born to be straight… but he wasn’t. <br />
There wasn’t much thought put into applying to Claw Valley University. Just another college among the dozen or so he applied to in order to please his parents. Mr and Mrs Ruan weren’t too happy when it was the only University that Tai was accepted into.<br />
Tai was beaming during orientation. While most people we’re giving hugs and tearful goodbyes to their parents, Tai was relishing the fact that for the few months he would be free from the closest, all he had to do was meet someone. <br />
“And over on our left we have our new College of Computer Science”. A man who looked to be in his early twenties was guiding the orientation group. He had a toned build and reddish-brown hair with thick sideburns. “And with that we’re going to stop here for lunch before heading to the dorms but before eating, does anyone have any questions? Yes you in the back with your arm raised can I get your name.” The guy with his hand up goes beat red as he grabs the attention of everyone in the group. “ I-it’s Todd, a-and never mind.” The orientation leader just nods his head “Huh, same name, cool, well anyways if that’s then you all are free to grab a burger and relax while we wait for dorm assignments.” <br />
Tai sat on the grass and ate his burger alone. Sure there were plenty of tables to sit at but he had already made a decision to try and reinvent himself during his time at college. No more of the obedient wimpy son he acted as to please his parents. Tai is his own man and it was time to start rebelling, or at least that’s what he liked to tell himself. In all honesty, even though Tai was happy to be free, he wished his parents were with him at that moment so he wasn’t alone.<br />
Tai felt a finger tap his shoulder, a little firm  but it got him to turn around and see a very attractive individual. The first thing he noticed was his nose, for some reason Tai always had a thing for guys with big noses. His brown hair was styled in a crew cut and his smile was giving Tai a certain feeling down in his pants. “Hi, I’m Hussam mind if I sit with you?”. Tai patted the ground next to him while Hussam sat down and looked at Tai, waiting for him to speak instead Tai grabbed his phone and typed something before handing it to Hussam. “Mute. I’m not sure how good your ASL is, so do you mind if I type?” Hussam got that look on his face the same as anyone else did when Tai told them he couldn&#39;t speak. Whether it was annoyance that any conversation would be slower than they are used to or sadness that Tai wasn&#39;t “normal” the look was always the same, pity. “Yeah no problem, truth be told I came over here because you&#39;re the only other non-white guy in our little tour group, and this is a bit forward but I was hoping we could be friends.”  <br />
The pair continued eating their lunch in relative silence until Todd called for their group to  start heading towards the dorms.Tai was a little upset that Hussam wasn&#39;t his roommate but at least he was next door. As he was setting up his side of the room, what could only be described as two rowdy jocks, the kind of person Tai wanted to be, came barreling into the room. “Dued, hey, nice to meet you. I&#39;m Justin and this is my buddy, Buck, looks like I’m your roommate this year.” Tai held out his hand to shake it but Justin grabbed it and pulled him into a bro-hug. Once he let go Tai pulled out his phone and showed them the message he typed earlier. Buck then without saying anything gestured with his hands and asked for Tai’s name. “ I remember the alphabet but anything past that will take a bit of learning”. Justin grinned widely and punches Buck in the shoulder. “Dang bro, you didn’t tell me you knew sign language!” Buck punches him back and replies in a jovial “I have a life outside of working out with you. Anyways Tai, Justin and I were planning on meeting our roommates then heading out for dinner.My roommate Hussam already said he’d meet us after calling his family. Do you want to come?” <br />
Tai just nodded and followed the jocks to the dining hall where Hussam sat at a table blankly staring off into space. As soon as they all sat down with food Hussam was smiling and laughing as Justin told a story about Buck getting caught by him with a girl in his room. Hussams looked like he was having a good time but it seemed like something was bothering him. Then again Tai had only met the guy this afternoon so perhaps it might be best not to make quick assumptions. Eventually the topic of everyone&#39;s class schedule came up and they all noticed how they were all now taking a class called “Anthro 101” that wasn’t there earlier when they signed up for classes. <br />
Justin was the first to speak up, “Probably some weird anthropology class for freshmen. WhateverAs long as it doesn&#39;t mess with my workout schedule I’m good.”. The four of them finished dinner then got their shower caddies and headed to clean themselves off. Once again taking the lead, Justin threw off his clothes and struts toward the closest showerhead. Buck went next and and seemed to be flexing his cheeks as he covered himself with his hand. Husam surprised Tai as he dropped his pants and walked off as if nothing was off. Tai just stood still for a second and admired the three men, they all had nice builds. Hussam had muscle but was toned, while Juctin and buck are jacked for guys coming fresh out of high school. They all stood taller and more fit than Tai but while they were all washing their hair, Tai noticed that calling any of them average would be a compliment. Hell, none of them seemed longer than 3 inches. The show didn’t last long as the four of them toweled off a head towards their rooms for the night.<br />
Tai and Justin crashed into their beds and began to slowly doze off. Or at least that&#39;s what Tai wanted to do but Justin seemed to have other plans. As soon as he thought Tai was asleep Justin pulled out his phone and began tugging his prick. Tai was mortified, the sound of his roomate combined with the sound of whatever lesbian porn Justin was watching lead to him having a rough night. Try as he might, he just couldn&#39;t fall asleep. Eventually the room started to heat up and Tai felt a strange sensation all across his body. Not unpleasant but like a strange kind of soreness from working out, despite Tai never working out before, Tai breaths became more labored and the bed seemed to get smaller. Tai wanted to get up and grab some water or something, but Justin continued to pound his dick. So Tai just laid quietly in his bed until he fell into a deep slumber, unaware of tomorrow&#39;s surprise.</p>
