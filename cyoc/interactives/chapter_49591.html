<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked over all three options…well actually the two options, the other was just a mystery, but then, all of these options seemed to be a mystery to you.<br />
Option two seemed good; you were promised to receive an advance respiratory system and some type of external bodily defenses with bionic legs. You aren’t quite sure why, but the idea of biological transformation or modifications just does not settle with you. Who knows what type of respiratory system you might receive? Maybe those aliens will implant gills on the scar free skin of yours. Nevertheless, the idea of organic appendages that are not humanoid just seems creepy.<br />
The only thing you know that both options will receive are bionic legs…but why both? Did the Minbari have some diabolic reason for this? You aren’t sure, but you did not want to waste any time to allow the computer to choose for you. Nevertheless, bionic arms and legs will give you super strength just like the Bionic Woman or the Six Million Dollar Man from those elder television days.<br />
As you push the button for the first option, immediately two metal clamps strap around your ankles, then a powerful flash of light temporarily blinds you as your body lays limp against a table. You try to lift your body, but you can’t move. When the Minbari moves your hand inward to rest on the table, you can’t feel his touch. It’s like being in a dream where you can see and hear everything, but can feel a thing.<br />
Slowly the table begins to lay you back in a horizontal manner, like laying flat in bed; all you can see are the glass panels on the ceiling. Soon two more bald and boneheaded Minbari assist the lab technician as he preps your body for transformation.<br />
As the ceiling opens up, a series of drills, tubes, knives, and other wicked operating tools descend from the ceiling slowly, creeping closer to you face with every passing second. One of the Minbari, with a smooth crestbone, and looking more feminine takes hold of the device and guides it into place just right over your forehead.<br />
Your breathing begins to quicken as you realize that they are going to drill, cut, slice, and knaw off limbs to replace them with artificial limbs. ‘What a horrible mistake you made’ you tell yourself. Waiting, knowing that the operation is soon to begin, you close your eyes, but you can’t do a thing about your ability to hear as the device is turn on and the drills and saws begin to spin and turn around at bone-slicing rate!<br />
The Minbari takes the device and with two retractable arms, clamps them just right above your ears. You open your eyes, fear is overtaking you. You’ve heard horrible stories about Minbari abduction, but not anything like this! The second Minbari, who also looks female, walks over to your side and takes your hand in her head and actually holds it as if consolidating you. Your mind is jumbled with confusion as you try to understand. The Minbari stays right in eye sight, and as you try to speak, you find you can’t move your jaw for it too is paralyzed and numbed beyond any earthly anesthesia.<br />
The Minbari holding your hand looks at you and speaks gently. “Don’t fret, you wont feel a thing.”<br />
The other female Minbari, whom has been in charge of the device, moves one of the drills just above your ear, right next to the dimple. The male Minbari takes a shaver and shaves away the hair to expose to site. With a steady hand, the female Minbari gently pushes the drill into your skull and as the spinning blade drills away bone, flesh, and tissue. The feeling is not there, but the vibration is deafening. The sound is like having you teeth drilled times by ten. You’re sure that you’ll go deaf from the operation, but soon the drill stops and is pulled out. Next, a tube is inserted inside the hole and with a tremendous pressure; a semi-organic chip is inserted next to the brain and is hooked next to the eardrum.<br />
As the female surgeon pulls out the catheter, the device is activated and for one moment, a horrible screeching noise fills your head as the device adapts to your biology. With the translator device now inserted inside your ear, the Minbari uses a substance to fill in the hole and to seal the wound.<br />
As the device is lifted off your forehead, the female Minbari drags it exactly over your chest. With the device in place, both female Minbari step away from your body and join the lab tech at the control console to begin the second phase on the operation…your bionics.<br />
Just the idea of having your arms and legs lopped off is discomforting, but your eyes watch the device as it stretches out two arms with hypodermic needles attached to ice-blue tubes that connect to the central part of the device. Stretching down near your legs are two more robotic arms with five hypodermic needles, all attached to ice-blue tubes. As the device is lowered down, the needles poke your skin and as the needles make contact with your bones, there they stop.<br />
You aren’t really sure what is going on, you were expecting a little blood and gore, but all that is happening are eighteen needles resting comfortably on top of your bones. As the device emanates a few clicks and moans, those needles begin injecting nanities that immediately form wires. Each needle has a purpose; the needles pump at least two ounces of nanities that form at least two pounds of semi-organic poly-fibers that all interconnect inside every tissue, bone and even up to the atypical level of the epidermis. The sensation is like having billions of worms squirm throughout the legs, feet, arms, and hands.<br />
Within ten minutes, the squirming sensation fades away and the device pulls the needles out of the skin. As you lay there, you breathe a sigh of relief; you still have all your appendages, but now what lies ahead of you?<br />
The Minbari lab tech leaves the room and is the last time you’ll ever have to see him. Now it’s the female Minbari’s turn to complete the transformation, but they are required to have you enter the data, and to be sure that the adjustments you asked for work to satisfaction. As feeling creeps back into your body, you don’t feel a thing, soon you are able to twitch your toes, and wiggle your fingers to the point that you are moving your arms, and sitting up. As you look at your legs, you notice that you are no longer secured. With bionics, you can seek your revenge against those who hurt you. As you look at them, you notice that the razor has been left behind, as you pick it up, what will you do with it?<br />
As the other female Minbari departs the room, the other Minbari notices that you have something in your hand. She reaches out to you, “Hand it over.”<br />
You’ve been caught, if you hand it over the Minbari might believe you were going to hurt her, and if you use it, you may be able to escape safe and sound…what do you do?</p>
