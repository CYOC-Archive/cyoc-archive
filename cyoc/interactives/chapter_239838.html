<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer made it to her first class on time thankfully, the layout of the school had changed slightly to accommodate all of the different species. <br />
<br />
Her new teacher was a stern weasel who sat cross legged at her desk as she watched the students shuffling in. Jennifer expected to become bored with class as she generally was, but the novelty of everyone kept her attention sharp, probably the sharpest in the class she thought as she looked over to see a wolf&#39;s toothy yawn. <br />
<br />
School felt completely new, even after Jennifer&#39;s second class she still was committed to watching everyone around her. The cafeteria had changed too, now serving a wide range of food with meals separated for a wide range of different species. Her lunch consisted of a mix of everything, a perk of being an omnivore. The quality of the food had risen too, it seemed this world kept getting better and better. Jennifer wondered what potential drawbacks a world like this had, her brain blanking on the idea before shrugging as she took another bite of her meal.<br />
<br />
As she ate, two figures appeared around her. Jennifer&#39;s ear flicked as they both sat down at the table. Looking up from her food Jennifer saw a scruffy looking canine girl, Jennifer couldn&#39;t determine the breed, maybe a samoyed or husky. Wearing a cut top that showed her midriff, she had a nice coloring of white and black, a curled tail wagged behind her. &quot;Hi Jenni, nice to see you!&quot; the girl said giddy with excitement and energy. Jennifer smiled to herself, it looked like the girl was going to burst with excitement seeing her, just like a real dog.<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled and nodded as she turned to see the other girl and was shocked, it was a owl, maybe a barn owl? Jennifer didn&#39;t know her birds. The owl wore a long dress that lacked any sleaves, instead her whole back was bare. She had a similar shape to the other birds Jennifer had seen previously, with no hands or arms, just giant wings, maybe all avians were like this. Jennifer spied around the table to see the girls talons, they were massive and scary looking. She sat down, her plummage shuffling slightly as she set down the food tray that was balancing on the top of her wings. &quot;How did you do on that last test Amber? I heard a lot of groans after the teach handed the results back.&quot; the owl girl said.<br />
<br />
Amber, the now named dog girl shook her head. &quot;I did good.&quot; she paused. &quot;I lied, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t do that good it was hard. Sorry. I&#39;m sorry I lied.&quot; Amber spoke so fast it was hard to keep up with every word. The owl laughed. &quot;You know you can&#39;t lie, even if you could with a straight face your tail would give it away in an instant.&quot; Jennifer smiled to match the energy at the table.<br />
<br />
Amber pouted. &quot;Aw, you&#39;re so mean Katherine, not everyone can hide their emotions like you.&quot; Katherine winked, &quot;It comes with being a owl, if anything we know how to be quite and patient.&quot; Both girls turned to Jennifer. &quot;So...&quot; Katherine trailed off. &quot;Oh my gosh Jenni, it&#39;s been, like, forever since we all hung out!&quot; Amber finished.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed, she didn&#39;t really have an answer to her past activities in this new life. She rubbed the back of her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I just have been busy I guess?&quot; Jennifer said unsuredly. <br />
<br />
Amber was nodding at each word Jennifer said, her full attention listening to her as Amber&#39;s hands cupped just under her muzzle. &quot;I see, busy....OH!&quot; Amber snapped her claw. &quot;Was it that boy, what was his name? Soren!&quot; Amber clapped her hands. &quot;Yea the wolf that was chatting you up, did he end up taking you out? He seemed cute, if he didn&#39;t maybe you should introduce me?&quot; Amber blinked several times to convey her begging, her tail wagging constantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please.&quot; Katherine scoffed. &quot;He was only flirting because it&#39;s almost that time of the year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time of the year?&quot; Jennifer questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, did you forget? It&#39;s nearly mating season, everyone gets restless right around before it starts.&quot; Katherine straightened her back. &quot;Some people like to be wined and dined, others just run out into the streets looking for a good time.&quot; Katherine shrugged. &quot;We&#39;re all freshman now too, this is the first time we&#39;re all allowed to join in any public celebrations, so I think a lot of the boys are trying to use the opportunity to get with their crushes.&quot; She playfully nudged Jennifer. &quot;Hey I guess that means you got a crush, I figured someone would fall for you eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber chimmed in defense. &quot;Hey you&#39;re being mean again!&quot; she huffed. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to her, you gotta do what you want. Me and Kat were planning on heading out sometime tonight to see what all the excitement is about? You wanna come? You do right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked down at her meal, she didn&#39;t know what kind of party this was, but given the context it didn&#39;t sound like a slumber party. She tapped her nail on the table. &quot;I&#39;ll have to make sure it&#39;s ok with my mom first.&quot; Jennifer said embarrassed.<br />
<br />
The two girls laughed, Katherine stopping as her laugh accidentally turned into a hoot, causing her to blush, hoping nobody had heard. Amber only took that as a sign to laugh even harder. Wiping a tear from her eye. &quot;Ah don&#39;t worry Jen, your mom&#39;s pretty chill, just ask her. Heck she might even want to tag along.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer shuffled her paws hearing that, surely her prude of a mom didn&#39;t do anything like that? Clearly the world had a wildly different culture that what Jennifer was used too, it was beyond just everyone turning into an animal, they had always been one, history was completely different. After lunch Jennifer decided to hit the library&#39;s computer to see what exactly this world had in-store for her.</p>
