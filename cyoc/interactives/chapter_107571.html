<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Backtracking earlier to midafternoon.<br />
<br />
“Are you out of your flipping mind,” Emily shouts; “How could you do this?”<br />
“Because it needed to be done mom,” Brian shouting back; “The question you need to ask is why didn’t you have this done sooner?”<br />
“You know the answer to that Brian,” Emily snapping back.<br />
“Bullshit,” Brian responds; “the elder council will ensure no blow-back comes back to us in regards to this.”<br />
“Don’t bet on it,” Emily looking distraught; “once they find out you had a paw in declaring your father dead, any hope of them shielding us from trouble will be wishful thinking.”<br />
“Again. Bullshit. In order for dad to get this fixed,” Brian glaring; “is for him to come to Moon Lake and appeal to the elder council. Since the council knows he ran out on us, they will make dam sure he answers for his mistakes before they even consider assisting him.” Brian getting up from his computer to lean on his dresser to look at a photo of him and his father just before he left, “Before you run off to call Andrew Curry or the were-otter rep; answer me this. How many times have they asked for you to do what I just did?”<br />
<br />
Emily Walker is upset and made as hell, she couldn’t answer; her son was right in that regard. Both council reps have told her in the past to have her dead beat husband declared dead. It would have been the only way they could help her and her son deal with George Walker and his questionable acts. Emily just gets ups and walks out of her son’s room, leaving him alone.<br />
<br />
Brian looking at the photo of him and George taken months before he ran off; looking at the smile on his face as he is holding a stuffed giraffe Brian won at the fair that year. His father also smiling as he grips his son with one hand and a bag of cotton candy in the other; it’s the only photo Brian has of his father, the last happy memory he had. Brian balls up the picture and tosses it into the trash can. Turning back to his computer he notices he has a new message waiting for him; looking at his inbox he sees that it is from a George Walker.<br />
<br />
Brian unsure of how to proceed; he knew very few people knew of this email address of his. Knowing that he runs through the list. Brian’s two best friends at Moon Lake High; neither knowing about his father’s acts. His mother; who wouldn’t possibly do this. And then Julie; Julie Stovall had this email. In fact Brian recalled telling her about his father and what he did. Brian feeling rage building up in him; thinking if this is Julie’s best attempt to get back at him for that worm he sent her.<br />
“Stupid guppy,” Brian seething; “you know not who you are messing with.”<br />
<br />
Before Brian starts crafting his response to Julie’s counter attack; he thinks on the conversation he had with Eric and Frieda during lunch last Friday; he sends and email to them as well as Spencer, warning them of Julie’s latest computer attack. Whether this was another test run or something larger he could not elaborate. But he does ask for all of them to meet up before the start of school tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Finished with his email to the three; Brian sends it off and then turns his attention back to Julie. Despite her best attempt to disguise herself; Brian was able to see through the message and knew it was Julie. The grammar, prose and the words used were a clear give away. While Brian was half tempted to expose her, Brian decided to turn Julie’s mind game against her.<br />
<br />
‘If you are who you say you are then you will know of the stuffed animal I won when we both attended the fair all those years ago. The next time you want to talk will have to be in person; after you have to deal with the elder council and appeal to them over reversing being declared dead.’<br />
<br />
Brian smiles as he hits the send button to his reply. Moments later he sets up his email account to exclusive. Only making his friends messages and any from Eric, Frieda, Spencer or his mother safe from being declared spam.<br />
“Good luck trying to figure the first part of that message out Julie,” Brian chuckles; “because I know I never told you that.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Emily Walker was on the phone with Andrew Curry; she was telling him what Brian just did, worried what might happen to them.<br />
“Emily,” Andrew doing his best to remain calm despite his own grief stricken outburst during the emergency elder council session; “while I agree, Brian went about the matter in the wrong way. He is correct.” Andrew sighing before continuing, “Now that George is declared dead, the council can now help you. George can’t change Identities without our help in getting a new social security number.”<br />
“Are you sure,” Emily asking; “it took my son all but fifteen seconds to have my husband declared dead, at the federal level.”<br />
“Well it’s going to take a day or two for George,” Andrew responding; “to notice something is off. While he may not be using his name; chances are he is using the same social security that was given to him when born.”<br />
“So Brian is right,” Emily shaking her head; “George will have to come back here to get this fixed.”<br />
“And before we help him,” Andrew answering; “he will be required to make amends and restitution to you and Brian. The council already has a scroll waiting for him; once he shows his face, I or another council rep will place it in his paw. Emily it was nice hearing from you, but I have to go now; if you want I can talk to your son Brian later.”<br />
“That would be nice, Andrew;” Emily answering. With both hanging up; Emily looks at the time and sees its nearly 5pm.<br />
<br />
Emily felt somewhat relieved after her talk with Andrew Curry; the wer-mer rep for the elder council. Knowing that the council is aware of the situation her husband put on her; and secured in the knowledge that they will make him fix it. She just wonders how long it will take before both she and Brian see an end to their financial woes.</p>
