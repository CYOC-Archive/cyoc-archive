<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny sat down on the swivel chair and twirled around slowly while she pondered Jeff&#39;s question.  What would she want to change if she could change anything about her or Jeff?  She didn&#39;t really believe it would work, but it was an interesting thought exercise.  There wasn&#39;t anything she was really dissatisfied with, other than the fact that she had to sneak around just to be with him.  Why did her mom have to be so paranoid?  It&#39;s not like she would do something stupid.  Just because Jeff was a boy...<br />
<br />
Jenny sat up and stopped spinning.  That was the problem, they couldn&#39;t just hang out easily because Jeff was a boy, so he could never come over to her place, and she had to sneak around just to see him.  But what if he wasn&#39;t a boy?  At first, Jenny pushed that idea aside;  she wasn&#39;t into girls, she was into Jeff.  However, as she considered it, she realized there was a solution.  A mischievous smile crept across her face as she came up with an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, if you want to prove it works, I have a suggestion,&quot;  Jenny grinned at Jeff, who shifted uneasily.  &quot;You have to change yourself so that you can pass for a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to be a girl?!&quot;  Jeff gaped.  This wasn&#39;t what he bargained for; he figured Jenny would want him to be sexier, or would want to make herself more attractive.  However, Jenny waved him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to be a girl, but to be able to convince others you are one...specifically, my mom,&quot;  Jenny clarified.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you sick of all this sneaking around?  If mom thinks you&#39;re a girl, then you can come over anytime you want, and we can hang out without mom getting on my case.  Anyway, if this works, you can just change yourself back afterwards, so no one else has to know.&quot;  Jeff looked at Jenny skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it&#39;s just temporary...but what exactly do I have to do?&quot;  Jeff asked nervously.  &quot;I mean, just dress in drag?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, mom might think you&#39;re trans but definitely not a girl,&quot;  Jenny stuck out her tongue.  &quot;First off your face has gotta be cuter, less of a square jaw, and no facial hair.  Making your hair longer would help sell it, and of course we gotta get rid of your Adam&#39;s apple, and your voice can&#39;t be so low.  Your chest we can fake with padding, but your arms and legs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta be kidding me,&quot;  Jeff grimaced.  &quot;And I suppose I&#39;ll have to shrink myself...down there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, not really,&quot;  Jenny grinned.  &quot;You can even make yourself bigger if you like, as long as you can hide it.&quot;  Jeff stared at Jenny blankly for a moment.  &quot;Oh c&#39;mon, it&#39;s not like this thing really works, but it&#39;d be fun to have a sleepover if it could work,&quot;  Jenny cajoled, trying to keep Jeff from sulking at her suggestions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot;  Jeff scowled, but then had a thoughtful look.  &quot;But I get to decide how I change everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  Jenny smiled sweetly, playing along, not really expecting anything to happen.  Jeff spent a few minutes selecting and modifying options on the Chronivac, surprisingly meticulous about the changes considering he didn&#39;t seem to be that enthusiastic about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done,&quot;  he said, finally leaning back, and reaching for the &quot;Enter&quot; button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on!&quot;  Jenny cut in, giggling nefariously.  &quot;If you want me to believe this thing works, then I gotta see it.&quot;  Jeff looked at her questioningly, but then a realization slowly began to dawn on him.   &quot;Strip!&quot;  Jeff glared at her, suspecting she just wanted to laugh at him, but since he was certain it would work, Jeff stood up and removed all of his clothes.  &quot;Boxers too!&quot;  Jenny goaded, as Jeff completed undressing, which resulted in an annoying catcall from Jenny.  Totally nude, he leaned over and finally hit the &quot;Enter&quot; button on the computer.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed to happen, and Jenny sat there grinning at an uncomfortably naked Jeff.  However, after about a minute, her smile began to change into an expression of disbelief.  Slowly but surely, Jeff&#39;s short hair was growing, first past his ears, then past his jawline, and then into wavy brown tresses across his shoulders.  As Jenny stared dumbfounded, Jeff&#39;s facial features began to soften, his jaw becoming more pointed and his lips fuller, as any stubble receded into his cheeks.  His eyelashes lengthened and his cheekbones became finer, giving him a doll-like air.  <br />
<br />
Only at this point did Jenny realize that Jeff&#39;s body had been changing as well.  Losing a bit of height, Jeff&#39;s limbs adjusted proportionally, but also became less bulky, now holding more of a slender, wiry charm, and much less hairy.  His squared off pecs and thin hips also began to shift, his chest becoming slightly softer and his torso gaining an hourglass shape.  However, his genitalia remained intact, but due to the change in body proportion, Jenny couldn&#39;t tell if Jeff had gone with her suggestion and made it bigger, or if it was just an illusion caused by Jeff&#39;s slightly decreased size.<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a slight moan, leaning on the back of the chair as his body changed, and Jenny heard the pitch of his voice rise gradually as his Adam&#39;s apple faded away, leaving a smooth, slender neck.  His hands and feet shrinking and becoming thinner completed the transformation, and Jenny found herself standing as she stared at the new Jeff in awe.  Feeling the changes come to a close, Jeff stood up and looked down at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;  Jeff said in a breathy, feminine voice, striking a sultry pose for Jenny.  &quot;Did it work well enough for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny couldn&#39;t believe her eyes.  Apart from his genitals and his flat chest, Jeff looked and sounded like an extremely cute, attractive, and perky teenage girl.  Although Jenny wasn&#39;t attracted to girls, she couldn&#39;t help but think that Jeff was beautiful.  To Jeff&#39;s surprise, and to some degree her own, Jenny walked in front of Jeff, who was now slightly shorter than her, put her arms around him, and kissed him eagerly.</p>
