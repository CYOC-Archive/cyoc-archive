<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You opened your closet and discover that all you clothes were changed to clothes you would associate a leprechaun with. With no other choice you get dress in a stereotypical leprechaun outfit. After you put the knee high socks and the traditional leprechaun shoes and hat, you stare into the mirror and feel like these were the clothes you were meant to wear. <br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear a knock at the door and opened it. In the doorway was another leprechaun that looked very similar to your new form but a few years older with a full leprechaun beard. &quot;Tghen should have never been around you. She knew I wanted  to unlock your true leprechaun form and teach you about your true world. That bitch is going to pay big-time next time I see her. But enough about that can I come in, we have a lot to discuss&quot;, the leprechaun says. Sorry some reason you feel like you can trust him and let him in.  <br />
<br />
The Leprechaun walks down and sits in your computer chair. &quot;I&#39;m Fionntán Gallagher and I&#39;m your biological father and your true  name is Donnchadh Gallagher. I just so happy you are finally a leprechaun again and not a stupid human again&quot;, he says with a tear in his eyes.<br />
<br />
You stare in shock at the leprechaun in front of him. You always knew that you were adopted and dream of one day meeting your biological parents but you never thought that this would be the way you meet your father. Still you feel deep down inside that he is telling the truth and that he is your father. It would make sense since you did feel like you didn&#39;t belonged anywhere and you hated science and most modern technology. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you dad but I&#39;m going to need an explanation&quot;, You say to your father. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to know when your mother and I gave you up for adoption. You see when you were born our clan, the clan Gallagher was in a military alliance with many other clans and mythical species , called An Solas (Gaelic for The Light). An Solas was fighting in a war against a group called Bringeoirí Múchta (Gaelic for Extinction Bringers). Bringeoirí Múchta was made up by leprechaun&#39;s and members of other species who hated the way that the human&#39;s Cold War ended and decided to try to bring upon the outcome that they wanted themselves. They believed the humans should be extinct and we should destroy them and then divide the world between the mythical species. Me like many mythical creatures have humans with a passion but knew that Bringeoirí Múchta need to be stopped because we shouldn&#39;t decide what species deserves to live or die. You were born in the 3rd year of the war and your Grandfather, the former clan leader of our chances, was assassinated by a spy just two months before you were born. After that I was made clan leader and me and your mother began plans to make a spell to make you into a human and hide you in their world. We did sure only a leprechaun that was in An Solas could break the spell that was making you human. I never got to held you in my arms because we immediately got work on the plan to keep you safe. The war didn&#39;t end until your were seven and your mother died in one of the worst battles of the war. I immediately began to search for you and bring you home, but the orphanage was shut down and the documents were destroyed in a fire so we didn&#39;t find you until you were 14. I first saw you at your middle school graduation, I made myself invisible so no one would notice me. When you walked on that stage I realized you were happy being human and I couldn&#39;t shatter your world. So I decided to wait until you turn 18 to break the spell and bring you home but Tghen from the Loingsigh clan somehow found out and decided to meddle. She didn&#39;t even finish in breaking the spell&quot;, your father says getting up and then uses his magic to break the last bit of the spell.<br />
<br />
You look in the mirror and see that you now have a beard as thick and long as your dad&#39;s beard. You also begin to notice that you are shrinking to the size at you associate a leprechaun as and your father is shrinking too. Then you finish shining you are 6 inches and look in the mirror again. You are now the textbook definition of a leprechaun and you feel like this is the real you that your human form and life was a costume.<br />
<br />
You father gives you a hug and says, &quot;now that the spell is over the the humans that know you and even your adopted parents are losing their memories of you, we added that in so no one from your human life will try tolo look for you. Just picture yourself human size and you will become human sized again&quot;. Your father then begins to return to human size. <br />
<br />
You close your eyes and and picture yourself the size of a human and when you open them you are back to human size.<br />
<br />
Your father uses his magic to summon a bunch of suitcases. He then summons  your leprechaun clothes and begin to pack them into the suitcases. &quot;You need to choose what items do you want to bring with you. Unfortunately under the International Leprechaun Congress all leprechauns under 25 are considered minors and must attend school. I got you in the boarding school for American Leprechauns. I wanted you to attend the boarding school that I went to in Ireland but I figured that we should ease your way into the leprechaun world and the boarding school will teach you how to use magic, make gold and summon items and fix the stupid human bullshit you were taught in human school. I know you hate technology and don&#39;t worry the school uses as little of modern technology as possible&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
You grab the photos from the photo album of you, your jewelry, and a few other things and stuff them into the suitcases. When the both of you are finished packing your father uses his magic to destroy your unwanted belongings and teleport them in the dumpster. <br />
<br />
He then teleports your suitcases to the boarding school. The both you shrink down to your leprechaun heights and leave the house and your old life behind</p>
