<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breathing heavily, still dizzy from his orgasm, Harry called out through the door. &quot;N-no,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m coming out!&quot; What he didn&#39;t quite realize was that the large load he just desperately licked, sniffed, and jacked off to was indeed his Matt’s. And that alpha seed that was now inside him happened to be infecting him progressively, from the inside out. Not that Harry knew it.<br />
<br />
What Harry did know was that the pure and raw masculinity that he imagined in his head was something he now craved. He slowly stood up, feeling strange as a tingle lingered at the back of his head. He slipped back into the clothes he so carefully folded and set aside. He headed to the sink to wash his hands, and as he did inspected his face. The stubble that appeared on his face was by no means subtle, and was more noticeable than anything Harry had ever seen on his face before. However, instead of recoiling and being offended by the sight of hair on his own face, like he usually would, Harry instead was entranced by the sight of it. Instead of looking obscene, it looked… Good. Great, even. Before, he hated the very idea of even a vague moustache on his face, but now there was something unusually attractive about the stubble on his face. He liked it.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Harry felt compelled to then lift his arm up and flex it. With his sleeve pulled back, he saw his biceps barely tense on his thin arms. He’d never had a problem with it — his scrawniness that is —  as he never had any desire to look huge or play any sports. It was something all the jocks at his school were into, but he was never really like that. But now, looking at his arm right now, and the image of his now-so-muscular step-brother working out in his head, he couldn’t help but wonder… What if he was like that? What if he wasn’t a weakling? Harry didn’t mind that these thoughts were things he never would’ve ever thought before. They were just thoughts.<br />
<br />
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted, as well as his study of his own string bean arm, by Matt echoing through the door once again. <br />
<br />
“ARE YOU GONNA GET OUT, THEN? I GOTTA PISS!”<br />
<br />
“Coming out now, sorry!” Harry was way too distracted at the sight of his own appearance, much more than he wanted to admit. He wasn’t usually so obsessed with his appearance like that. Snapping back into reality, he dropped his arm and dried his hands off on another damp towel in the bathroom. He quickly unlocked the door and stepped out as Matt stepped in.<br />
<br />
Before Matt could close the door, Harry interrupted him. “Hey, are you guys… Still working out?”<br />
<br />
Matt was shirtless, his body slick with sweat. His mouth hung slightly open as he was breathing heavily, seemingly recovering from some intense reps. “Dad’s done for the day, the old man’s was hitting the weights before I was. But I’m just taking a quick piss break. Why?” A grin slowly crept across Matt’s face as he suddenly realized what Harry was getting at. “Oh… Is lil Harry finally going to join us?”<br />
<br />
Harry gulped. He nodded. “Y-yeah.” He felt suddenly motivated to work out. Just the sight of the pure masculinity that Matt now exuded made Harry weak, and Harry wanted it.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah,” Matthew said. “Just head into my room, I’ll get to you in a sec.”<br />
<br />
Harry walked into Matt’s room, confused as to why he said yes. A part of him told him he should just say nevermind, doubting his sudden and hasty decision. But walking in Harry was hit by the intoxicating smell of musk and sweat, underlined by the vague smell of body spray, and those thoughts suddenly faded away. Harry sat on Matt’s bed, waiting for his step-bro to finish. On the side of Matt’s bed he noticed a cum-stained hand towel, as well as a cum sock that was recently used, clearly damp at the end. The scent of cum suddenly filled his nostrils and he couldn’t stop himself from grabbing both and inhaling. The image of his step-bro aggressively jerking off after a workout entered his mind again.<br />
<br />
He quickly dropped the items as Matt stepped out of the bathroom and into the room.<br />
<br />
“So bro, let’s get started.” A smirk was on Matt’s face.<br />
<br />
Matt decided to introduce Harry to the world of weightlifting with bicep curls. He handed Harry two dumbbells, and the latter was nearly pulled downward by the weight of the dumbbells. But Harry slowly, but surely began to curl his arms upward, dumbbells in hand, in a slow and careful repetition. And it was starting to feel good.<br />
<br />
As he continued, something clicked in Harry’s head. A fleeting thought regarding his past obsession with maths was squashed. For now, Harry would still know much more about maths than his house or his family, but thoughts about nailing down a workout routine now lingered in his head. A seed was planted, and he was nurturing a new interest.<br />
<br />
Each curl seemed to be easier than the rest, and soon Harry was lifting them up like he was a natural. There was something so energizing about the motion. Sweat rolled down his temples, and over his body. But after 10 reps on both arms, Matt stopped Harry. “Good set.” Matt said, patting Harry on the back. Harry put the weights down.<br />
<br />
“For a beginner like you, you’re getting the hang of this really fast. And you’re already filling out,” Matt said, not thinking much of Harry’s tighter clothes. “You’re a natural, bro.”<br />
<br />
Hearing those words of encouragement was more than exciting for Harry. “Thanks, bro,” Harry said. <br />
<br />
Immediately after saying that, Harry clasped a hand over his mouth. A moment of clarity hit him. His clothes felt usually tight. He didn’t call people bro. He didn’t like gym stuff or sports stuff, he liked math! He was, for lack of a better word, a nerd! And the most shocking thing about that phrase was that his voice was slightly deeper than before! Nothing near as deep as Matt’s voice, but Harry’s voice sounded noticeably different. <br />
<br />
“What happened, Harry?” Matt seemed confused. He faced Harry and stepped closer, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. And in that moment, the smell of sweat and musk once again hit Harry’s nostrils. “You look tired out. All good, since that was your first real workout. But you know what I like after a good lift?”<br />
<br />
Harry’s anxiety once again faded away as he looked up at Matt’s grinning face. Maybe some changes were good, Harry thought.</p>
