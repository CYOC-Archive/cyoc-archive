<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jackie and Ann now talked Lisa could hear the bell ring. “Must be mom and dad,” she said as she approached the front door. Opening it she now saw her parents smiling. “Hi mom, hi dad.”<br />
<br />
“Hello Lisa,” Marilyn smiled, hugging her daughter. Marilyn happily looked over her daughter, admiring the slight baby bump her daughter now had. “So hows the little one doing,” she asked.<br />
<br />
“She’s been interesting,” Lisa laughed. “Nothing to out of control so far. A little bit of morning sickness that’s about it.” Marilyn nodded as Martin now stepped forward. “Well having done this a few times now Lisa I can say that this is only the beginning. Hopefully the little one doesn’t make you allergic to anything. Your sister Ann made your mother allergic to seafood.”<br />
<br />
Lisa chuckled as she now escorted her parents into the house. “Hey Gloria,” she called. “Can you take grandma and grandpas bags upstairs.” Gloria now hustled down the stairs hugging her grandparents as she now gathered up their bags. “Gloria I can help with the bags, besides it will give us a chance to talk,”said Martin. Gloria nodded as she curiously followed her grandfather upstairs. As they reached the spare bedroom he glanced cautiously around before smiling. “So where is she?”<br />
<br />
“Who Grandpa?”<br />
<br />
Martin chuckled as she looked at his granddaughter. “Lynne,” he smirked, causing Gloria to gawk at him. “Don’t be so surprised Gloria. Our friend told me all about her. So is she up here?”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed as she now called for Lynne. Martin smiled as the young teen now slowly opened her parents door. “Umm Hey Grandpa,” she said shyly. “My goodness you certainly do look like your mother,” he smiled. “And before you ask, no I’m not surprised. A mutual friend of ours kind of clued me in before I drove here. Your grandmother on the other hand has no idea.”<br />
<br />
“Wait grandma doesn’t know,” Lynne gasped. “Umm Grandpa aren’t you kind of inviting her wrath by not telling her?”<br />
<br />
“Handling your grandmother is what I do,” he shrugged. “Now why don’t you tell me everything.”<br />
<br />
Lynne shrugged as she now recounted everything that had happened over the previous two weeks. Martin listened intently, nodding his head in response. “Well probably not one of your best ideas Lynne,” he said calmly.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Lynne whined. “Kind of had to if I was going to change things for the better. Ugh even in this time you always  point out my mistakes Grandpa.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Lynne,” he said quietly. “It’s just...well...you do seem to remind me of Lisa quite a bit. Your mother probably would of done the same thing at your age if she could. Always wanting to help without thinking things through.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah you remind me constantly,” Lynne smirked. “Still it’s so great to see you. I missed our talks since I got here. You always kind of reign me in. Well....except this time.”<br />
<br />
“So any idea how we’re going to introduce you to the rest of the family,” Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
“Guess I&#39;lljust go down and say hi I suppose,” Lynne shrugged. Martin laughed softly as he looked at the young teen. “Yeah your definitely your mother’s daughter.”<br />
<br />
As the three now made their way downstairs they could see Ann, Lisa, and Marilyn talking amongst themselves while Jackie and Stephanie chatted quietly. Lynne cleared her throat loudly causing them to all turn. “Umm Hey Everyone,” Lynne said sheepishly. “Kind of wanted to come down and say hi.”<br />
<br />
Lisa gawked at her daughter as Marilyn curiously gazed at her. “Lisa who is this,” she asked. Lisa paled as Ann and Marilyn now approached the girl. “Uh Lynne,” Lisa stammered. “Maybe this isn’t the best time. We umm kind of have guests that aren’t to familiar with this uh...situation.”<br />
<br />
“Relax mom,” Lynne sighed. “I’ve met everyone here before, I mean it’s a lot later than now but hey no time like the present.”<br />
<br />
“Lisa what is she talking about,” Marilyn asked. Lisa fidgeted as she stared between Lynne and her family. Unable to answer she remained unusually quiet. Ann slowly began to understand what was going, turning she now gawked at the young teen. “Wait,” she said slowly. “Is...is that Lynne?!?!”<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” Marilyn asked. “Whose Lynne?”<br />
<br />
“Umm mom,” Lisa said sheepishly. “This is Lynne, my daughter.....my um...unborn..daughter.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn narrowed her eyes as she now gazed at Lynne. “Wait what,” She stammered. “But..how is that possible? And where did you come up with a name like Lynne. Lisa, what is going with on?”<br />
<br />
“Hey what’s wrong with my name,” Lynne aid grumpily.<br />
<br />
“Young lady now is not the time,” Marilyn stated. “Now Lisa, you need to tell me what exactly is going on.”<br />
<br />
“That goes double for me,” Ann added. “How is that possible. Also can she explain how she has that much magic that she can travel through time.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa don’t pin this on me,” Lisa said defensively. “I was just as surprised as you are when she showed up. I didn’t force her to come through time.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Marilyn frowned at Lisa who looked exasperated at her family. “Oh my god I can’t believe you two are trying to blame me for this.”<br />
<br />
“Well you are her mother,” Marilyn snorted. <br />
<br />
“Can’t believe I’m saying this but I agree with mom,” Ann sighed, “Lisa why didn’t you send her home immediately. Her remaining here can’t be a good thing. What she changes things so much that it erases her existence or something.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously Ann,” Lisa said flatly. “What is this Back to the Future?”<br />
<br />
<br />
As Ann and Marilyn continued to admonish Lisa, Lynne sighed. “Geez didn’t think I would get mom in that much trouble.” Gloria could only groan, Ann had already experienced some of Lynne’s wild magic while Marilyn was still trying to come to terms with magic. “Yeah Ann and Grandma really aren’t dealing real well with this.”<br />
<br />
A smirk now spread across Lynne’s face as she looked at her aunt and grandma. “I have an idea,” she said. “It’s not a great idea but it will help mom.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne what are you doing,” Gloria said fearfully.<br />
<br />
Lynnes smiled as she pulled a pouch out of her pocket. “Well,” she said mischievously. “Ann and grandma always did have an old fashioned way to them. I’m just thinking I can make them a little less old fashion.”<br />
<br />
“What,” Gloria exclaimed. “Lynne, no. We’ve got other people here besides our family. Do you really want the. To learn about you and magic like that?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm good point,” Lynne said. Gloria sighed in relief, thankful she appeared to have talked her head strong sister out of doing something crazy, “Guess I’ll have to take care of them too.”<br />
<br />
Gloria shrieked in surprise as Lynne now approached Ann, Marilyn, Jackie and Stephanie. Things were about to get rather chaotic in the Turner house.</p>
