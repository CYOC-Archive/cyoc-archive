<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra&#39;s search through the options for adding a head via the Chronivac were slow.  The options had confusing names and the tooltips were long and hard to understand.  Clearly whoever had made the easily understood profile settings hadn&#39;t been the same person who made the settings here.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes she was confident she had found what she was looking for - a &quot;Consciousness Source&quot; setting.  She found that by default it was set to &quot;Create New - Duplicate Profile&quot;, but she could change it to &quot;Profile (Native)&quot;.  The tooltip badly explained that her consciousness would simultaneously inhabit all minds that were linked to it.  Kendra took that to mean that she would not only physically have 2 heads, but would be able to think 2 things at the same time.<br />
<br />
Happy with her discovery, Kendra used the 3D view controls to duplicate her head and get both heads evenly spaced at the top of her upper torso/between her upper shoulders.  She was extra careful to make sure both heads had the Consciousness Source setting set correctly then saved.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath and clicked Apply.<br />
<br />
Then held her breath and waited.   After about 10 seconds she peeked out and looked around.  She looked down and waved her arms around.  Nope, she was still the same.  Still a humantaur, but one with 2 arms and B-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
Kendra checked the Chronivac program but all it showed was a &quot;Please wait...&quot; box and a spinning cursor.  She sighed and stood up to all 4 legs.  She took a few steps when suddenly an intense drowsiness descended on her.  The bed felt impossibly far away as she staggered, and she just barely managed to reach the bed before everything went black.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When Kendra woke up, the room was dark.  Some glimmers of moonlight came in through the window and faintly illuminated the center of the floor.  The buzzing of an alarm drew her attention away from the bed she lay on.  She moaned and pushed herself to hands and knees and crawled across the bed.  She grabbed the alarm clock and checked the time.<br />
<br />
The alarm had been set to remind her to feed the cat.  It was 9:14, so the alarm had been going off for 14 minutes now.  She sighed and crawled back to the edge of the bed where she got up on her 4 feet.  Kendra knew her mom&#39;s cat would hold a grudge if it wasn&#39;t fed... It had probably already done something atrocious that she would need to deal with, and she knew it would escalate quickly if ignored.<br />
<br />
Kendra&#39;s muscle memory guided her to the door and she raised arms to cover her eyes from the blindingly bright light of the hallway.  She glanced down to see Mr Fluffies grumpily sitting directly in front of her door.  As well as a few new scratch marks on the door.  Kendra sighed and headed over to the stairs.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even consider that she was walking down stairs with 4 legs until she was halfway down.  When the thought came to her she quite literally jumped a couple inches into the air in surprise and glanced back over her shoulder to look at the stairs she had just come down.  She got a somewhat obscured view of the stairs, and much closer to her, a flattering view of her butt in her tight pajamas.  Kendra smiled and continued down the stairs to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen she grabbed Mr Fluffies&#39; water and food bowls and filled the water bowl in the sink while she pulled the bag of cat food out of the cabinet... The empty bag of cat food.  She sighed and waited for the water bowl to finish filling before going into the pantry to get a new bag.  She idly carried the water bowl with her - one of the cat&#39;s idiosyncrasies meant she needed to give him both water and food at the same time or he would throw a tantrum.<br />
<br />
Back at the sink she held the water bowl away from Mr Fluffies, who had jumped up on the counter and decided to try to accelerate the process.  She held the bag up out of reach of his claws with both hands while she cut the top off with scissors.  Something felt slightly... weird.  She ignored the feeling and got food poured into his food dish and both dishes down onto the ground.<br />
<br />
With the cat occupied with his late dinner, she put the food bag back up into the cabinet and headed back upstairs.  She carefully watched the stairs as she climbed - even though she had come down the stairs no problem earlier, she didn&#39;t want to risk tripping on her way back up.  The noise from the show her older sister had playing on the living room TV caught her attention, and as she slowly and carefully walked up the stairs she craned her head over to see what was playing.<br />
<br />
She quietly giggled to herself on successfully reaching the top of the stairs.  She hadn&#39;t taken her eyes of the stairs the whole time, and she was feeling more and more natural in this changed form. Kendra returned to her bedroom and closed the door behind her.  She turned the lights on and closed her eyes to think for a moment.  Ever since she woke up, something had felt just.... slightly off.<br />
<br />
Kendra walked over to the door to the bathroom and pushed it open.  She rapidly inhaled to suppress two instinctive screams.  In the mirror she saw herself with all the changes she&#39;d made on the PC.  2 heads, moving independently and staring at each in the mirror in amazement.  4 arms that she held up and grinned at the ease with which she moved them.  4 nicely improved breasts that she quickly squeezed and grinned.<br />
<br />
Now that she was aware that she actually had the extra limbs and head, using them suddenly went from instinctive to being something she was aware of.  Not that it became harder, but she became aware of the 2 different directions she was looking at, the 2 different thoughts she was thinking at the same time, the 4 hands that idly clenched and relaxed or held the door open.<br />
<br />
A pair of identical smiles spread across her faces.</p>
