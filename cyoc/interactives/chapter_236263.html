<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen hung out in the living room having finished her work, and waited for the pizza to arrive, her mother had handed her cash and she slipped it into her bust. Jen groaned after she was alone. “Really Jenny? Do you really have to be so... sexy all the time darling?” She found herself referring to her old mother as herself anymore, she couldn&#39;t even think of her old name, Jessica was her mother, not the body she was inhabiting, even though she knew different.<br />
<br />
Jen got up when she heard the doorbell ring, she flung her hair back, pulled the shirt&#39;s window a little lower and presented herself to the delivery boy. The kid had to be seventeen, Jen presented herself in the most sexy milf pose possible, unable to behave differently, she felt embarrassed. “Here sugar,” She pulled the money out of her cleavage, “Keep the change, my way of saying sorry for not being on your menu tonight.” She winked at him, smiling and biting her tongue, he blushed and she shut the door, she hummed to herself and walked the pizza to the table. Then went to the living room and waited for her mom to come out.<br />
<br />
“Well, at least we have some manners still Jenny.” She said to herself, still not used to Jessica&#39;s voice coming from her mouth. She lay on the couch, her hand idly twirling her hair as she sat, her mother came out and they sat at the table together and ate, Jen found herself eating her pizza with a fork and knife, just like Jessica used to do, she never understood why she always ate it like that, but she gave up on trying to understand all of her new habits. She&#39;d just have to discover them as she went along, they talked about how their days went, Jen having to lie about some of her day. Afterward they got into the living room and watched some reality shows they liked, they were still the ones that Jessica would watch and they commented on the show as they did.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Her mom said, “She spent all that money on a boob job? She was supposed to use it to get to the states! Ugh, this fucking skank and her fake tits!” She moaned. “Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with...”<br />
<br />
“Oh stop! I&#39;m not mad.” Jen responded “Although she is a stupid bitch.”<br />
<br />
“True!” <br />
<br />
“Still, I&#39;m kind of envious.”<br />
<br />
“Oh? How so?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I do want to go bigger.” Jen tried not to react to her bodies statement.<br />
<br />
“Really? You&#39;re already at an H cup, and you want to go bigger?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I just fantasize of having like... P cups, nice big and round. You know, dirty girl that I am.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t see how you deal with them now. Still, it&#39;s your body Jennifer, if you want to, well maybe...”<br />
<br />
“Oh I&#39;m just talking off the cuff, P cups would probably be too big for me. My girls are just fine as they are.” She groped her breasts. They giggled and continued watching shows until ten, when her mother had to go to bed for the next day. Jen walked her way back to her bedroom, where she shut the door, and locked it, then took off her top. “No, Jenny, we don&#39;t...” She proceeded to take off her bottoms as well, leaving her completely naked. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from sitting down at her computer in the nude, she let out a sigh. “Let me guess sugar, you were a nudist when alone?” She shivered, she turned on her computer and waited. Once the system booted up she went to look at her email, but found her hands opening the browser instead. “NO. JENNY. NO. I GET THAT I&#39;M YOU, I GET THAT THIS IS YOUR BODY AND I&#39;M IN IT. BUT NO. I. WANT. TO. CHECK. MY. EMAILS. EMAIL FIRST. THEN WE GO WHERE YOU WANT TO. OKAY?” She sternly chided herself, tired of surrendering everything to her new habits, she gave herself or whatever it was that was doing these things some hell. She closed the browser and waited for a few minutes, moving the cursor over to the email, she sighed. “Thank you. We&#39;ll look at whatever it is after this okay?” <br />
<br />
Jen looked through her email, taking her time, her right leg began to bounce impatiently, she continued as the bouncing got worse. She sighed, then did the only thing she could think of, she started massaging  her breast, the leg relaxed as she finished reading her emails. She closed the program and sighed. “Okay now, what are we doing.” Jen watched as her body went to autopilot, guiding her to a site where it logged in, it then opened a thread on the forum and pointed at the screen. <br />
<br />
“Sexy cougar fucks next door neighbor boy.” Jen read softly, “Is... is this ours? Do... do we role play?” She started reading, her eyes glued to the thread as she read the seedy story that Jessica had written along with someone else. She found herself compelled to read on, getting aroused as she read the seedy story, her right hand on the mouse her left hand absently caressing her breast. She shivered, properly horny now, her hands opened the drawer and pulled out an insertible vibrator. “Now... wait.” Her hands grabbed some lube as well and prepared the vibrator, then slipped it in and turned it on a medium setting. “I&#39;m... not ready...” Jen cooed quietly as her eyes continued on the story, her hands on autopilot she couldn&#39;t get a grip as pleasure started to fill her. <br />
<br />
Jen cam as she hit the part of the story where the two lovers finally have their affair, she shivered, legs shaking as her body finally got what it wanted all day. “Fuuuuuuck.” She moaned quietly, “Ooh Jenny, we&#39;re going to have such fun together.” She cooed as she pulled the still running vibrator out of her pussy, she panted, her room smelling of sex, she finally got herself back together when she heard a voice.<br />
<br />
“Oh Jenny Wenny,” Jen shivered, she hadn&#39;t said that, “You&#39;re just like momma now.”<br />
<br />
“No...” Jen whispered, “You can&#39;t be here.”<br />
<br />
“But I am,” the voice in her head said. “I&#39;m part of you now, Jenny in her momma&#39;s body. It&#39;s sooo fucking hot.” Jen shivered, “And your just like me now! Oh we&#39;re going to have so much fun.”<br />
<br />
“You can&#39;t...” Jen said a little louder.<br />
<br />
“Shhhh, your other mother is sleeping, use your inside voice.” Jessica thought to her, Jen didn&#39;t know what to do, she tried to speak again. “Inside voice,” Jen&#39;s hand reached up and gently poked her head. “In here, I&#39;m part of you, you can think to me now.”<br />
<br />
“But... I can&#39;t... we can&#39;t...” Jen tried to reason things out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, but we can, remember the curse? You have to live with my habits, how I walk, how I talk, and act like I would? How are you going to do that without me? I&#39;m here, as your.... other personality? I guess that&#39;s it.” Jessica thought.<br />
<br />
“But, how?”<br />
<br />
“The curse babe. It made me your subconscious, and  I&#39;ve been waiting all afternoon for you to come back here, you did your homework. You had dinner with our new mother, which I like her, she&#39;s me, but without all the extras. And now you gave me what I wanted all day, at first I thought Kyle would fuck me, but you were given my body, and I&#39;m happy about that. I&#39;m young again, even if we&#39;re still a milf, and we get to spend all of our time together now.” Jen started to freak out. “Shhh hush honey, I&#39;m not going to possess you.” <br />
<br />
Jen panted for breath, trying to take in the fact that Jessica was apparently inside her mind, she shivered.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay honey, I&#39;m just here to guide you into my actions, you can still do what you want, I&#39;ve just got a hand in it now. I know, you were free, but now we&#39;re sisters, I guess that&#39;s how you could describe it.”<br />
<br />
“But, I.... I don&#39;t want this.” Jen thought.<br />
<br />
“I know, I&#39;d rather just be in my body alone again too, but let&#39;s make the best of this, we&#39;re sexy and young, we&#39;ve got a lot going for us, just relax, and I&#39;ll be here with you, someone to talk to, to plan with, after all, I&#39;ve got a full life of smarts that we can use. You&#39;ve been given a big advantage that no one else will know you have!” Jen sat there staring at the screen for a minute, when it dawned on her that she was right. “There you go, Jenny and Jessica, sexy girls sharing a body, we&#39;re a force to be reckoned with! Now, we should get to bed, we&#39;re going on a run in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Jen thought, “Can&#39;t we miss just this once?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, running, every Saturday and Sunday morning, no exceptions until winter.” Jen sighed. “First we get ready for bed, then we get cozy.” Jen&#39;s hands started to shut off the computer, Jen gave in, letting her other personality do what it wanted to, she was tired. “There we go, let&#39;s get some sleep.” <br />
<br />
Jen got up, her own free will to do so, and went to the bathroom, cleaned herself, and brushed her teeth,  then went to bed, Jessica would talk to her in a dream that night, where they would set things straight.</p>
