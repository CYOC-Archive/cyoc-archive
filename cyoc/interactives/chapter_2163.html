<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby took a second or two to catch his breath, and then went over to check out the books in the fantasy and science fiction section.
<br />
     &quot;Oh my god,is that you Bobby? I hoped I'd run into you. Figured after you finished that last book you were reading you'd be down here checking out the special new transformation story section they just put in.&quot;
<br />
     Wendy Watson had this ability to find Bobby, even when he did his best to hide from the rest of the world. 
<br />
     Not that he didn't enjoy her company. In fact, she happened to be one of his best buds. It's just that at times it bugged him how well she knew him and his habits, and there was absolutely no hiding anything from her try as he might.
<br />
     So, it didn't surprise him when she mentioned the ring on his hand and the trail of old people and babies in the mall.
<br />
     &quot;I figured it could only mean one thing,&quot;she said as she snapped her gum and twirled her short, curled-under, dark brown hair around her a long red fingernail,&quot; that you somehow had found some new toy, and of course I had to find you because I couldn't bear to miss the fun.
<br />
       Take it that this thing allows you to make people younger or older?&quot;
<br />
       &quot;Well, only women.&quot;
<br />
        &quot;Yeah, I figured that, judging from the fact that all I saw along the trail were females. So, where are we going from here?&quot;
<br />
        Bobby liked the girl, probably more than he cared to admit. She stood a little taller than him, and had a nice butt and great breasts, even if they were a tad large. She used to even joke, that her tits entered the room about five minutes before she did.
<br />
         Still, she was 19 as compared to his 22.Then again, he could always add a few years, and it might be fun to have someone else along on this escapade. If nothing else, she could   help him remember who he added or subtracted age from.&quot;
<br />
        &quot;Oh, what the hell. I figured I'd go home and change, and then go to TGI Fridays from there, if you want to come along.&quot;
<br />
        &quot;Yeah,I'd love to, thought you'd never ask,&quot;she answered, as she lightly brushed her hand across his back and ran a few of those talons she called fingernails through his hair.
<br />
         &quot;I take it from the fancy clothes that you intended to go out later anyway?&quot;
<br />
          &quot;Oh, you know me, I like to keep my options open. So, what are we waiting for,let's head to your place get you ready.&quot;
<br />
          &quot;It doesn't take me that long to get ready,&quot;Bobby said hesitantly. 
<br />
          &quot;Bobby, don't forget who you're talking to. I know that it takes you at least an hour to get a shower, change your clothes, and make sure that lusterous hair of yours is just right.
<br />
           By the way, were those two strangely dressed senior citizens I saw coming out of the mall anyone we know?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Oh yeah, that's Stacey and Jeanine. They dared me to turn them 65, so I did.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Cool. So, how old do I get to be?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;You have to be at least 21, but other than that, it's pretty much up to you.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;It's about 6pm now, and we don't want to miss any of the fun, so let me think about it and we can talk as we walk.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Hey, I did come here to pick out a book...&quot;
<br />
           &quot;And,&quot; she said shoving one into his hands,&quot;here's on I noticed while we were standing around chatting.It's called,&quot;A Fate Totally Worse Than Death&quot;, and I highly recommend it. Now take it to the counter and pay for it, and let's get going.&quot;
<br />
           So, we headed for the counter to pay for it, but got distracted on the way by some guy of about 50 talking to a woman of about 25.
<br />
           She wore a hot pink tube top, with a long sleeved white dress shirt tied in a halter style,and black jeans. Her tight curly red hair had been pulled back with a hair clip, accenting her cheeks. 
<br />
           &quot;Hey Kristy, even though I happen to be available since my wife paased on 5 years ago, and I really find our time together wonderful,won't it bother you being seen with someone my age. I'm not sure if this could work, and you might think of leaving me for some younger guy if I got much older.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;But Don, there's got to be a way.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;And there is,&quot;Wendy said as she elbowed Bobby,firmly getting his attention.&quot;Go ahead Bobby, turn her into a fifty year old woman before his eyes.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Okay, here goes nothing.&quot;
<br />
           As they watched, she rapidly passed from her twenties to her thirties, and added a few pounds so that her pants filled out and looked noticeably tighter.
<br />
           &quot;Kristy, what's happening to you?&quot;
<br />
           &quot;What do you mean Donald,&quot; the now 38 year old woman said as her features sharpened somewhat,and crows feet began to form.&quot;We've known each other for years, and 38 and 50 aren't really that far apart.&quot;
<br />
           &quot;But,you're, I thought you were 25, and...&quot;
<br />
           &quot;Oh Donald, honey, you know I'm 44 if I'm a day,&quot; she replied. Grey and white hairs crept in one by one, and more fine lines had made their appearance.Small bags now showed under the eyes,her tummy bulged somewhat, and her butt had filled out.
<br />
            &quot;Well honey, I have to say, I feel a little confused. I could swear that...&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Maybe we better go sit down honey. Don't you remember, I just turned 50 last month,&quot;said the now more matronly looking woman.Her hair had gone completely white on top, and she had scattered grey and white curls amongst a sea of faded red. 
<br />
            &quot;Hey, that went really well, didn't it. Now, we have how long to find someone to transfer these years to?&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Oh, exactly ten minutes.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;That'll be $5.99,&quot; the woman with faded blonde hair behind the counter said.
<br />
            She looked tired as she took the money, and wiped her arm over her brow to catch the sweat that threatened to dribble into her eyes.
<br />
            Bobby handed her the money, and she gave him his change and bagged his book.
<br />
            &quot;Here you go dear,&quot;she said.&quot;Oh man, be glad you're not a woman and don't have things like menopause and hot flashes to deal with,&quot;she told him.
<br />
            &quot;You don't look that old,&quot; said Wendy.
<br />
            &quot;Oh, thanks sweetie. But it just came on this last year when I turned 47,and if it weren't for this natural hormone supplement I take, I think I'd be climbing the walls at times.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Well,&quot;said Wendy conspiratorially,&quot;what if a few of those years could go away.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Oh honey, I'd be eternally grateful.But that really isn't possible, is it?&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Yes mam,&quot;Bobby said,&quot;I can make you twenty five years younger,if you'd like.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Well then, go ahead and do your thing dear.I'm more than willing.&quot;
<br />
            The well dressed woman soon found herself slipping back from her thirties, with lines disappearing and her body firming up here and there. 
<br />
            &quot;I feel so much better!&quot; she said,&quot;This is fantastic!&quot; 
<br />
            Things continued, until a very happy 22 year old woman stood before them. 
<br />
            &quot;You know, I'm so grateful for this, that there's something I'd like to give you to show my appreciation.&quot;
<br />
            Reaching behind the counter, she grabbed a large bag and handed it to Bobby.
<br />
            &quot;I noticed your ring, and I remembered seeing something about it in this old book.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Wow, thanks,&quot;said Bobby,blushing slightly as she hugged them both and gave them each a peck on the cheek. 
<br />
            After that, they let Evelyn know where they'd be later, and invited her to drop by if she'd like. 
<br />
            &quot;Oh, that sounds great. I'll see if I can get away, after I get dinner and take care of my hubby.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Oh, just bring him along,&quot;Wendy replied,&quot;they serve food there that he'd probably like,and that way you get a night away from slaving behind a hot stove.&quot;
<br />
            &quot;Girl, it's not slaving when you love what you're doing. How do you think I got that larger figure you saw when you walked in?&quot;
<br />
            They chatted for a few moments more, and Wendy and Bobby headed back to his place to get him ready for a wild evening out.</p>
