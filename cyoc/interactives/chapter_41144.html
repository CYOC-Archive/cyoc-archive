<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; you say. &quot;You gave me these awesome big feet. How about a foot rub? I mean, if that's okay and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master I...&quot; Genie blinks. &quot;I am sorry; I know you requested I do not use that title.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don't want to treat you like a slave. I'm just -- this is awesome, I'm a kangaroo guy! I was scared at first but now it actually seems cool. I mean, look at the size of these things,&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
You hold your right foot up. It's large enough that it looks silly and having only three toes per foot will get used to, but you know you'll manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, they are impressive,&quot; Genie says. &quot;If you desire I massage your feet then all you need to do is ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be fun for you too right?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasing you is what I desire,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is, I want you to enjoy it personally, not just because you're doing your job,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;To find a master that cares about my enjoyment is rare,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about this, can I wish for you to feel the same enjoyment on your feet as I do on mine?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
Genie nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I also wish to be in a nice big bed where we're alone in the outback? It'll nice and warm,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Genie nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I wish for you to be a female kangaroo person like me but you know, a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Genie nods once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're awesome Genie!&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
You wish for those things. A shiver goes down your spine at the power you seem to have access to. All of your crazy fantasies could come true with simple requests.<br />
<br />
In a flash of light, you find yourself standing before four sets of white curtains that form a square around something. <br />
<br />
You assume you're in the outback. It's warm out. Heck, it's hot out. Small beads of sweat are already forming on various parts of your body. Your fur itches a little.<br />
<br />
Turning your attention to the curtains, you part one side. You see a large bed with a female kangaroo person who has proportions similar to yours standing by it. She's clad in a baseball cap but nothing else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
The female kangaroo nods. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look amazing,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am pleased that you enjoy my work,&quot; Genie says. &quot;While this form is not one I might have chosen to try out, I do enjoy the opportunity to exercise my abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you're okay with being a girl then?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The body is but a shell that houses what really matters,&quot; Genie says. &quot;However, that doesn’t mean that one cannot enjoy the potential pleasures their current physical form offers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Current physical form?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;When one can alter their form or the forms of others with a simple request or command, the physical body feels more like clothing for the soul then a sort of binding.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. &quot;That's an interesting way of putting it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genie walks over to you and rubs your chin. “So, my kangaroo friend; you requested a foot massage?&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulp and nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then my friend, lay back and relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
You climb onto the bed and manage to lie down on your back. It's a bit more difficult with your body shape and tail but you're able to manage. You put your hands behind your head over the pillow. Genie stands at the foot of the bed and smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such nice big feet,&quot; she says. &quot;This time, even *I'm* proud of my work.&quot;<br />
<br />
She starts massaging the silky soft pad of your left foot with careful precision. You moan in pleasure as you experience joy you never knew existed. Your shorts feel tight as your body responds to her massage. <br />
<br />
From the smile on her face, you know that she's enjoy it on her foot as well.<br />
<br />
It's not long before your body betrays just how much you're enjoying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you're enjoying my massage. Would you like me to free you of your garments?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
You nod and she smiles. You see a flash of light, feel a breeze and see that you're now clad in nothing but your fur. While you feel relieved that your manhood is now free (and betraying your excitement without shame), you feel rather exposed. You look at Genie and then at your manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not feel shame,&quot; Genie says. &quot;It is a natural reaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but -- it's times like this I wish I was female so I wouldn’t have this problem,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You gasp when you realize what you've just said. It was just an expression, something you said almost as a joke. However, magic words are still magic words. Genie reacts perhaps with instinct or out of some sort of playful pleasure and goes to work. Her hands move and you feel a ripple go through your body. If anything, at least it feels almost pleasant rather then painful. It only lasts a few seconds but by the time it's done, you are a changed roo.<br />
<br />
A gaze down at your body shows that it still looks more or less the same. There are however, important differences. Your manhood is gone; you have a pouch and a pair of furry breasts! A kangaroo having breasts seems strange but you know that you are not a normal kangaroo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie,&quot; you exclaim!<br />
<br />
Your voice is higher. The sound of it shocks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you wish. I was unable to resist,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right; I said those words,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish me to change you back?&quot;<br />
<br />
You touch your breasts and look at Genie. &quot;I can change back later if I want right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Genie nods. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I still have a foot rub?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
Genie beams. &quot;Indeed you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite your alarm at being female, you put your arms back behind your head and do your best to relax. <br />
<br />
You can always change back with a simple request. So, staying female for the time being seems at least worth trying out. You wonder if it will help you to better understand real girls.<br />
<br />
Genie resumes her massage. She works your left foot and then your right foot with mastery level precision that suggests that she's been doing this for years. Her touch is soft and warm, that of someone who takes enjoyment in making you happy. While it may only your imagination, she appears a little more willing to make you happy now that you're female.<br />
<br />
Given the smile on her face, you have a feeling that your wish that she experience the same pleasure you're experiencing is working.<br />
<br />
You realize with embarrassment that you're still excited in that way. It seems Genie allowed you to remain your attraction to females. You feel some relief that your body isn't being as obvious about it (as least in your mind it isn't). <br />
<br />
The change from male to female has apparently affected how you desire release. The part of you that's still male says it's wrong, that you're still male despite what your accidental wish has done to your body. Even you however can't deny that you feel a desire for release in the way a female would experience it.<br />
<br />
Imagining it only seems to increase the desire.<br />
<br />
Denial helps a little. In the end however, the weight on your chest and feelings from between your legs is pushing that denial further away with each passing second.<br />
<br />
Genie seems to be feeling the same thing you are.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you desire sexual release then all you need to do is ask,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
You gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I desire that but man you're amazing at massaging my feet,&quot; you say. &quot;I think I want -- I can't want it like this! I'm a guy, not a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no shame in your current desire,&quot; Genie says. &quot;At this moment, you are a female. As I've said, the body is but a shell. Certain desires change with form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I can't just start wanting that like a girl,&quot; you say. Your current body however is saying otherwise. &quot;But it's so hard to resist. Genie, am I -- does this mean I'm a girl for real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, you are a girl,&quot; Genie says. &quot;Your body is not an illusion nor a hallucination. If being a real female means having a female body then yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although you could reverse this with a simple wish, a part of you wants to experience this. However, you worry that you'll be betraying your manhood if you give into these feelings and especially if you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I can't want it like that. That's...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, degrading? Would wanting it that way or being a girl in general somehow make you less of a person?&quot; Genie asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not what I meant,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even you have to admit that there is such a worry. Allowing Genie to satisfy you in that way would require at least some submission on your part.<br />
<br />
On a very general level, growing up male had you in a role of earning permission to do something sexual with a girl. <br />
<br />
Whether societies or your own personal needs, a part of you needed to feel strong.<br />
<br />
Now, you find yourself wondering how much of that was instinct (both general male and what society more or less programs into boys) and how much of that was what you truly desired.<br />
<br />
You never thought you'd be the girl. Being the girl goes against everything you grown up with. Indeed, several girl role type things always seemed somewhat more acceptable when it wasn’t you that had to be in that role.<br />
<br />
It gives you pause to think about the differences between who and what you are.<br />
<br />
You express your concerns to Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should wish to be a pig for the way I'm acting and thinking,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, do not request I change you into a pig. You are simply being what you are, or at least we're,&quot; Genie says. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know that some guys take the guy stuff a little too far. But, some girls take the girl too far too,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is indeed easier to see fault in others,&quot; Genie says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to say that some of this girl just isn't me. But you saying the body is like clothes for the soul has me wondering where who I am ends and where what I am begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps if you spend time not just as a female but also as a kangaroo, you will come to discover an answer to that question,&quot; Genie says. <br />
<br />
“I’m not sure I want to start wearing makeup or dresses,” you say.<br />
<br />
Genie smiles. &quot;Not all girls do those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. &quot;Just like not all guys like sports or are experts on cars. Still though, if I stay this way, I might have to think about being a mother. The idea of being a dad seemed scary enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genie puts a finger over your mouth.<br />
<br />
“Shhhh, honey, you’re thinking way too far ahead,” Genie says. “Now, why don’t you just relax and enjoy the moment. I desire to please you and satisfy your desires; whatever they might be at the moment. Now, what would you like to do?”<br />
<br />
You consider it for a moment before making your decision.</p>
