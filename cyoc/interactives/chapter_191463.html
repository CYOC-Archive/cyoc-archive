<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the clock ticked down until his mom&#39;s expected arrival home, Jeff was faced with indecision.  Having his conciousnesses merge back into one was no big deal.  It wasn&#39;t like his memories were altered.  More like he remembered something he had forgotten.  But to turn his awareness off and actually alter his memories, forgetting who he originally was, the idea still made him nervous.<br />
<br />
At the same time, he was currently in a female body, in a female life he didn&#39;t know, scheduled to go on a date with his male best friend tonight.<br />
<br />
Neither altering his memories nor being lost in this life were appealing, so he went with the only option he had left.  With the Chronivac set to undo his original transformation into a female, he hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button.  As a familiar tingling sensation started flowing through his body, he got up and watched his transformation back into a male in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was of course his vagina changing back into a penis, as the clitoris elongated and swelled out, his urethra being pulled along with it to its tip.  The vagina sealed up, swelling out as his ovaries slid out from within his body and settling within his sac as a pair of testicles.  Looking at his shirt, which he had forgotten to take off, he noticed an opposite effect, as his chest seemed to deflate, with his breasts changing back to his original male pecs.  It hadn&#39;t even occurred to him before how his breasts had weight to them, but now that they were gone, his chest actually felt kinda empty.  Granted, this was partly because he was still wearing a bra, and they no longer had something to fill them.  As he was rubbing his chest, he watched as the shirt he was wearing changed colors from pink to blue, the lumpiness of the empty bra seeming to dissipate as it vanished from this reality.  Turning away from the mirror, he watched as his belongings changed, becoming that of a teenaged guy instead of a girl, the bedspread changing from pink to its original tan color.<br />
<br />
As he looked around, he noticed his perspective getting higher, as he returned to his original 5&#39;10&quot; height.  Turning back toward the mirror, he almost missed seeing his face changing back to normal, his hair almost to its original length.  Below, his legs were hairy, and they held up a pair of hips that were the proper width for a male.<br />
<br />
And, that was it.  He had successfully changed back to normal.  Having only been female for an hour at the most, his male body still felt very familiar.  Even the swaying of his balls between his legs was not that noticeable.  Thinking on it, he never really paid attention to how empty his crotch was as a female.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s about to change.  After putting on his male underwear and jeans, he quickly returned to the Chronivac, and relocated the option to change his genitals back into a vagina.  Making sure that reality changes were off (but setting the duration to &quot;Indefinite&quot;), he confirmed the change.  With his crotch covered by clothing, he focused on how it felt as his manhood shrunk away, his testicles being pulled up into his body once again, as his ballsack deflated and opened up.  Where he had previously felt the fabric of his underwear holding his ballsack, the fabric was now loose.  Pressing his hand against it revealed just how empty his crotch now was.<br />
<br />
No time to dwell on that, though.  Heading into the &quot;Inanimate&quot; package on the Chronivac, he located the option he was well familiar with: the &quot;Other Person&#39;s Anatomy&quot; option.  Opening that, he once again chose to become a vagina.  When the target options appeared, he chose his own.  Once again, the Chronivac alterted him that his conciousness would be copied into the vagina, so the host body wasn&#39;t without a conciousness.  Closing the alert, he went through the same options as before.  He kept both his own awareness and the awareness of his copy, so both would remember that the change took place.  He disabled the &quot;Telepathy&quot; option as he did before.  When it came to senses, he kept his eyesight, as the complete lack of visual input before was hard to get used to.  Likewise for hearing.  Sense of touch, on.  Taste was kinda weird, before, but he hadn&#39;t experienced enough of being a vagina to decide whether he liked having it or not, so he turned it on.  The only sense he didn&#39;t keep was his sense of smell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&#39;s home!&quot;  Jeff&#39;s little sister called from downstairs.  Out of time.  Though thankfully, Jeff didn&#39;t miss the option to change the duration.  By default, it&#39;s set to 5 minutes.  He once again set the duration to 24 hours.  Quickly glancing to make sure all his options were correct, he hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button, and felt a familiar sense of dizziness as his conciousness was duplicated between host and vagina.</p>
