<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had two identical twin brothers. Built like Vin Diesel, with similar facial features and shaved heads. One was even named Vin! The other was Anthony, whom everyone called Ant.<br />
<br />
They may have looked similar to Vin Diesel, but their well-built bodies were smoother. Softer skin, an even Olive tan tone. They did have large noses, but they were Italians, and their noses somehow fit perfectly with their faces.<br />
<br />
Their faces. They were actually almost puppy-dog / little kid cute. Big brown eyes, very youthful appearance. Their roundish heads and Italian-lookong faces made them look all of 12 years old. 12 year old heads on bodies shaped like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Come to think of it, they looked almost like a cross between Vin Diesel and the turtles.<br />
<br />
Their skin heads also suited them very well. They both had rather large hands, and Jeff took the old wives tales about the size of hands literally.<br />
<br />
Jeff always admired his cousins. Hell, if he were to admit it, he was deeply jealous of them. They were really great looking guys. And they always had eahother&#39;s backs, and fiercely loyal to one another. They were truly perfect brothers in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Vin was the slightly larger, slightly stronger, and more athletic of the two. He somehow was also slightly cuter than Ant.<br />
<br />
He decided he would give it a try. He would put in the parameters to become Vin&#39;s Italian penis instead of Mike&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything went dark. Pitch black. He tried moving, but couldn&#39;t. He was stuck. He couldn&#39;t breathe. Didn&#39;t need to breath. He felt hot, and had a musky scent about him. Also, the smell of cleanly laundered clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this it? Am I REALLY a penis!?&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his entire body felt....&quot;tight.&quot; He felt increased blood flow throughout his entire being, and a sort of tingling began to occur. He felt fabric press tightly up against his face, and heard talking coming from above. Vin&#39;s voice! He even heard him laugh a little bit.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, the pressure against the fabric eased up a bit, but he felt his entire being &quot;fill up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard Vin&#39;s booming, yet soft man&#39;s voice say &quot;ok, cya.&quot; He realized he must have been talking on the phone.<br />
<br />
All the sudden, he was &quot;outside.&quot; Fresh air slapped him in the the &quot;face.&quot; His body was strangely extended, and he was looking down. Down at a couple of well-built legs with shoe-clad feet. Then the floor suddenly got closer, and he thought he was going to be sick. He saw a pair of huge, wide hands reach impossibly far down towards the floor, and saw the take off those shoes one at a time. Then the socks. Then the legs stepped out of the pants and underware. Suddenly, the floor dropped really far away, and his view of the world consisted of those well-built legs, and huge feet way far below him! He was completely suspended in midair, thinking he was going to fall. But alas, he&#39;s attached to something. Or rather, &quot;someone,&quot; Jeff thought with consternation.<br />
<br />
The the feet started shifting. Then a mirror came into view as he began to stand upright, and there he was! Vin in all of his naked, well-sgaped glory.<br />
<br />
&quot;But where am I?&quot; Jeff thought. &quot;Could it be? That long, large penis? I did it? It actually worked!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he felt a churning way deep down inside of himself. Then he saw Vin raise his left hand. Saw it open. The large meaty fingers came into view, then felt the warm softness of his hands against his tightening and elonganing, tube-sgaped, armless body!<br />
<br />
The hand griped him firmly, yet softly. Them he was staring up directly at vin&#39;s face!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh!, He thought, as the tingling throughout his body suddenly ramped up!<br />
<br />
Vin&#39;s fist started yankingbup and down the poor shaft that now contained Jeff&#39;s essence. &quot;What did the chronivac say if I was ever used?&quot;<br />
<br />
But he didn&#39;t have much time to ponder the question, forhis world suddenly gotextremelt sensual! He&#39;d be drooling, and that&#39;s exactly what he started to do. All the sudden,a major explosion rocked his entire world and felt and tasted white hot gobs of cum that came shooting out of his single hole where his vision and taste were centered.<br />
<br />
Then he heard an electronic voice inside his head state:<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning: the subject has been used as intended for the object he became: a human penis. Restoration now non-functional. Have a great life!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. What!? Wait! It can&#39;t just leave me like this!! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! Move, move, move!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
He tried squirming around, but it was useless. He was stuck as his cousin Vin&#39;s penis! He could only &quot;move&quot; whenever Vin made him move. He could never move on his own.<br />
<br />
The suddenly, the giant mountain of a man he was attached to, began moving while still breathing heavily. Jeff had tucked back down as the orgasmic leftovers slowly faded throughout his body. But then, Vin grabbed him again!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Another round?&quot; Jeff thought. But as he came out of his &quot;home,&quot; he was looking straight down, cradled gently in Vin&#39;s giant warn, soft hand. And below him, way down several stories, was an enormous porcelain white basin filled with water. In the reflection, he saw a huge penis which was himself now, and the shape of Vin&#39;s head up above. It was a toilet, of course! <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s head was still &quot;slimy&quot; from the jackoff session, and Vin wasted no time going to the bathroom. Looking at at the water and seeing himself as a penis attached to Vin, he realized what was about about to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Not that! Anything but that! I forgot about this function! I only wanted to experience being jerked off!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was inevitable. Jeff felt the rush of &quot;water&quot; travelling up his limbless tube-shaped body, and was treated to the full view of the acrid-tasting yellow urine spraying out of his &quot;mouth,&quot; and into the toilet. Jeff would be crying if he could. He wanted it to stop, but he had no control. He was forced through this nasty bit of functionality. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the stream of piss slowed, and stopped. He was still leaking some urine, and a little of leftover cum.<br />
<br />
&#39;Urine and cum. That&#39;s my life now,&quot; Jeff sadly thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the world started shacking up and down, and all around. Vin have him a hard squeeze, as more dribbling of urine left his body.  <br />
<br />
Satisfied, Vin spun around, and Jeff the Penis went with him. Everywhere Vin goes, Jeff is now forced to go along. Dangling downward as the world spun, Jeff got his first taste of the rest of his life. Both figuratively, and literally. He&#39;s now a man&#39;s tool, used for both pleasure and business for a few moments, several times each day. Then forgotten about. It still hadn&#39;t fully hit home to him just what this means.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the tub, saw the shadow of an arm reach out, and heard water rushing out of a spiggot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good. At least he takes showers and will clean me off,&quot; thought Jeff.</p>
