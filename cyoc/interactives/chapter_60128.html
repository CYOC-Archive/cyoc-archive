<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick was amazed at how much the statue in the singlet looked like him.  He reached out to touch it.  His index <br />
finger ran down the neck and across the shoulder and to his amazement the shoulder strap on the singlet moved <br />
with his finger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; he gasped softly.  He looked across the room to where Mitchel was bent over inspect a case of <br />
trophies. <br />
<br />
He reached out his hands and slid the shoulder straps off the shoulders and down the arms of the statue <br />
revealing his statuesque twin's torso.  He stopped when he saw a scar on the muscled sculpture's abdomen in <br />
the exact same spot where he had his appendectomy scar. He reached out his index finger and traced the the <br />
scar on the cold chrome statue. To his surprise the statue pulled back from him and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That tickles,&quot; Nick heard his own voice say, but it came from the statue's mouth looming over him.<br />
<br />
He felt the statues cold metal hands grip his shoulders firmly. He blinked and suddenly he felt the silver <br />
pajamas tighten on his body.  Not like tight clothing, but like liquid paint. Nick felt the paint flowing into <br />
every nook and cranny of his body.  It tickled as it oozed inside his armpits and groin.  The statue's hands <br />
seem to grow warmer and warmer as Nick's body grew colder and colder.  Nick blinked he was rigid and being <br />
lifted off the ground. The statue still had a metal head and hands and probably feet, but his body was all <br />
flesh tone now - at least the part that Nick could see. The statue grinned, and peeled silver skintight gloves <br />
off its hands and then put them on to Nick.   From his perch on the pedestal, Nick could see Mitchel across <br />
the great room. He opened his mouth to shout, but discovered that the silver on his neck seemed to immobilize <br />
his vocal chords, just as the silver on his arms and legs prohibited movement. He looked in terror as the cold <br />
unmoving silver mask of his face removed its silver toed socks. Then the living statue put his head between <br />
Nick's spread legs. He tilted rigid Nick to the left and put the right sock on Nick's right foot.  Then he <br />
tilted Nick to the right and put the left sock on his left foot. <br />
<br />
The body language of the living statue with its singlet rolled down to its waist revealed emotions that its <br />
unmoving steely gaze did not.  He stood admiring Nick on the pedestal with his chest puffed out, his legs <br />
spread and his hands on his hip. He stood there triumphant. Then he reached up and peeled off the silver mask <br />
revealing the twin of Nick's own face.  Only this face was smiling, while the only expressions on Nick's face <br />
were fear and astonishment.  The former statue tossed the mask at Nick's feet.  He felt the odd fabric against <br />
his chromed foot.  It was as if his foot was bare instead wrapped in a silver sock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, bro, there's a statue in here for each of you and your buddies.  What the -?&quot; the former statue said <br />
looking down at the bulge in his crotch. &quot;That's new.  Let's have a look see - I need to put on your old <br />
clothes anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
The former statue peeled off his singlet to reveal a hairless crotch with sporting an erection.  Then he <br />
looked at Nick's silver bulge. <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is a boner?  Good thing you were sporting one when you became a statue, because you won't be getting <br />
any harder than you are already.  Heh, heh, let's get your singlet on you, Nick - oh, wait, that's my name <br />
now. Hm, do statues have names?&quot; he shrugged.<br />
<br />
Still naked the statue put its still warm singlet on Nick.  He leaned in close to Nick.  Their twin faces were <br />
inches apart. Nick could smell his twin's maleness, and his own growing metallic scent.  He licked his lips, <br />
and then he pressed his lips against Nick, and plunged his tongue down Nick's throat as his head tried in vain <br />
to pull away. He felt so cold and lifeless, except for his head. Nick began to kiss his twin back. It felt <br />
good. His life seemed to be flashing before his life, and at the same time he gained his doppelganger's <br />
memories.  He recalled the foundry where he was living metal hot liquid being poured into a mold.  The foundry <br />
workers were all very short - like dwarves.  A tall lithe pale man with long white hair had stood over the <br />
cooling generic human male mold (it was sort of like a giant Oscar statue), but then the weird guy with the <br />
white hair reached into a pocket in his cloak and pulled out a teddy bear.  The teddy bear looked familiar.  <br />
Nick realized it was the teddy bear he lost when he was a toddler.  The statue quivered as it cooled.  It <br />
shrank, and reformed to become the identical version of Nick as he was today. That was years ago.  The statue <br />
had waited all these years for Nick to come to trade places with him.  Nick would spend the rest of his life <br />
here.  He knew that as the former statue broke his lip lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Nick, but it was you or me,&quot; he said, &quot;Nick, hm.  I know I'll be Nicholas from now on,&quot; the living <br />
statue said as he bent over Nick's backpack.  He pulled out Nick's briefs, jeans, and t-shirt.  He soon was <br />
dressed except for his bare feet.  &quot;I may try the socks and shoes later, right now I like the feel of the <br />
floor beneath my feet.&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked at himself up and down and turned his back on Nick. He had the back pack slung over his shoulder as <br />
he started to walk toward Mitchel.  He froze and turned back to look down at the mask at Nick's feet. He <br />
chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost forgot,&quot; he said as he stooped to pick up the mask, and put it over Nick's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, perfect!&quot; he whispered.  He kissed his statue once more than using his shirttail wiped the smudge off <br />
Nick's now immovable silver face. Then he noticed the creamy smudge on Nick's metal singlet. It was cold metal <br />
firmly part of the statue now, but apparently the new Nicholas's cock had leaked pre-cum while kissing the <br />
former Nick.  He wiped that off too, and shoved the shirttail back into his jeans.<br />
<br />
He turned and started over to Mitchel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mitch, look what I found!&quot; Nicholas shouted.<br />
<br />
Mitchel turned and stood up.  He was surprised to see the Nick was back in his street clothes, but to be <br />
honest the silver pajamas had kind of freaked Mitchel out, so he was glad to see Nick dressed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I found myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got to see this, it's a life size statue that looks just like me.  There are so many statues in here, I <br />
bet there's even one that could be your twin,&quot; Nicholas said as Mitchel stared up statufied Nick. <br />
<br />
Nicholas put his hand on Mitchel's shoulder and squeezed it.  It was amazing to be able to move and to feel.  <br />
He wanted to share it with his brothers. He wanted Mitchel's twin to be free, to be replaced by the original <br />
Mitchel.<br />
<br />
Nick stared immobile with an unchanging expression, but his mind was as active as ever.  He tried to move. He <br />
tried to scream.  He tried to warn Mitchel. There had to be a way to escape.  Nicholas smiled up at him in a <br />
way that made clear to Nick that Nicholas didn't think there was any escape for him.</p>
