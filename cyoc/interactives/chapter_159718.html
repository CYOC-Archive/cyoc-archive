<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Colin was on his way back home, the goddess can&#39;t help but think back on how he became part of her life or, rather, how he became a part of her daughter life since its beginning. She had, of course, punished everyone responsible for this situation. She had fried specific part of the evil man&#39;s brain, making him speak or move. The dragon for his part was only guilty of being extremely naive, (and not respecting a very important protocol) but she had needed to make an example out of him so she had turned him into a wivern for the next millennia.<br />
<br />
Wivern are a magicless kind of dragon, easily identifiable by the fact their forelimbs and wings are one and the same, unlike other dragons who wings <strong>on top</strong> of their four legs. No wivern were born naturally, they all were transformed into one as punishment. Usually for a time period, as no dragon was inherently evil, but some were unable to learn their lessons and needed to be wivern until death. (There currently are only two wiverns, and one is due to turn back into a dragon soon.)<br />
<br />
Thankfully, that too trusting dragon-turned-wivern&#39;s kobold hadn&#39;t participated but instead tried to dissuade him and, when it failed, had denounced him, which is how the goddess had found out about Colin so fast. As a result she had made sure said kobold wouldn&#39;t be affected by the transformation of her ‘master’ and wouldn&#39;t loose her magic, like it usually was the case.<br />
<br />
That said the goddess felt guilty about how she had treated Colin all those years. She had tried not to punish him, regardless of her distrust, since he wasn&#39;t responsible. But the kid wasn&#39;t blind to how much the goddess was wary of him and had correctly guessed why. That&#39;s why Neptune wasn&#39;t ‘granted’ any kobold before, and why when she realized her errors and asked for forgiveness, she also gave a kobold egg to those two.<br />
<br />
And if you wonder why Neptune&#39;s kobolds are her own sisters, its simply because any kobold linked to her would become immortals too, a characteristic that would also be granted to any kids the goddess would ever have. She hadn&#39;t planed on having twin but was happy with it, it mean she would have three kids of her own. Maybe in the future she could adopt human orphans, they wouldn&#39;t live long but at least they wouldn&#39;t be cursed with immortality. Not any time soon trough, the fact she couldn&#39;t birth any mortals was still too painful…<br />
<br />
The first dragon ever was proud of how Colin turned out to be. When she had asked him for forgiveness, he had said that there was nothing that needed forgiving. Turn out that how crappy she had been with him was what pushed him to do everything in his power to be the best person he could be. He even had thought it was why she was being that way with him.<br />
<br />
Like his life wasn&#39;t hard enough with the common misconception among humans that being bound to a drakonoïd blurred the separation between the different minds part of the link. It couldn&#39;t be more wrong! Sure, drakonoïds communicated by exchanging raw thoughts and raw memories directly from one mind to another, but those ‘data’, fault of a better term, can&#39;t be mistaken for being ‘native’ to the mind they are given too. Not only that, but one need to actively send informations to someone else, it can&#39;t be donne by accident, not even while dreaming. What <strong>is</strong> hard is not sending all the contextual data with it, which is why most dragons would turn a human brain to mush if they tried to ‘speak’ to it telepathically. (Although a drakonoïd bound to a human is better at sending only the ‘brain-safe’ data to a unbound human, even if bound humans don&#39;t have any problem with a drakonoïd communicating as they usually would.)<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Colin&#39;s parents had accepted all this easily once it was explained to them. (So did his sister.) It was proving harder to explain to his grandparents, which is why her husband was still in Portland, Oregon, along with Neptune herself, to explain it to the two elderly human, and had made little progress. At least they weren&#39;t the kind of humans that built church, temples or whatever, treat everything she say (or they think she said or would want) as law, call her &quot;Empress of dragon-kind&quot;, see kobolds as her messenger, and think anyone bound to a drakonoïd is some sort of prophet.<br />
<br />
She had created the universe, sure, but as far as she is concerned it didn&#39;t warrant to be worshiped. After all, she was sure anyone would have ended up doing the same in her position, no? And when would humanity understand drakonoïds govern themselves? She have the final say when the others couldn&#39;t reach an agreement, but it was rare. Their way of communicating was fare faster than any form of speech, so much they usually could collectively take a decisions in minutes, if not seconds.<br />
<br />
And were did that belief that she could read peoples troughs came from? Why did humans think being omniscient mean she automatically know their every thought? She may be the lone divinity of the universe, she can&#39;t invade people privacy, and wouldn&#39;t even if she could.<br />
<br />
The worst being that all this started to affect Neptune&#39;s and Colin&#39;s lives more than it usually affected bound human and their dragons. Sure, most peoples who knew them also knew they were bound to each other, but that&#39;s all. But recently, rumors of Neptune being the goddess&#39; daughter and how it made her and Colin immortals had popped up and kept intensifying, and with their kobolds apparently having wings, peoples will start to draw conclusions, even if it&#39;s not really why those kobold have wings.<br />
<br />
More and more people started to call Neptune &quot;princess&quot; which, unless it was said as a joke from the few peoples in the know, she hated. As far as the young dragoness was concerned she was just one of her kind among others even if, unlike the rest of her kin, she was immortal, and the goddess&#39; own daughter. (And every drakonoïds saw things that way.)<br />
<br />
Then there was the matter of the magical notebook Colin had found. Since there isn&#39;t any evil magical being in the new reality he didn&#39;t even remember creating, never was and never will, the goddess, who didn&#39;t know either that things used to be different, wasn&#39;t worried about its origins. In fact, in this reality she was the one who created it. She had enchanted it so it would only choose someone with good intensions as owner. But the Journal of Facts had somehow developed its own facetious personality. Nothing nefarious, but the thing wanted to be used and made sure its owners would or, if it had been left behind, could make the nearest person do it instead. It could also change owners on a whim, but made sure never to be picked up my someone with bad intentions. (Which don&#39;t mean things couldn&#39;t end badly, alas.)<br />
<br />
She saw how Colin used it to make both his sister&#39;s life better, along with his, while making incentives for other humans to be more accepting and supporting of disabled peoples. Most would have thought he was being selfish, but she knew the truth, that he started with problems he knew well and had and inkling on how to correct, rather than starting big at the risk to create more problems, and potentially bigger.<br />
<br />
Again the goddess felt proud of Colin and his actions, and shame at how she had treated him in the past. But maybe she should encourage him to make more modifications to the world, before the Journal of Fact get bored and choose a new owner?</p>
