<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley had been studying for hours and the boredom of Sociology had gotten to him. Before long he had found his way on to Stumble Upon, and was clicking away. One website in particular caught his attention. The top of the page was strange. Riley tried to make out the strange symbols but just gave up. He scrolled down the page when a specific word made him lean forward in his chair. “TRANSFORMATION”.<br />
<br />
For as long as he could remember, Riley had been intrigued with transformations. The idea of turning into an animal brought up something that Riley had long loved. Without much thought, he clicked the link and brought to a page filled with chapters. Age Pro/Regression, Weight Gain, Body Swap, and further down, Animal Transfiguration. Riley smiled and clicked on that page. What he found next was a very familiar looking species selector, just like his favorite furry website. He clicked the dropdown menu and his eyes immediately fell on “Canine – Domestic”. With a click, he was presented with a large list of dogs.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…what to choose…,” Riley said, looking over the list.<br />
<br />
His attention then found itself at ‘German Shepard – White’.<br />
<br />
‘Interesting,’ he thought. So he clicked on it.<br />
<br />
NOTE: This incantation is to be read aloud, and will turn the caster into their inner breed/type of the chosen species. For full permanent and fully immersive affect all 10 lines must be read. For 12-hour affect, only 9 lines are to be read. Depending on strength of the casters will power their will not only be a physical transfiguration but a mental one as well; including new instincts, behaviors, needs, and mannerisms.<br />
<br />
“Haha, well…what the heck?”<br />
<br />
Riley began to read the incantation, feeling kinda silly as he did. Once he was finished, he sat at his desk, waiting for some changes. Nothing. As he waited, he opened his browser and clicked over to Facebook. He copied the link he found and sent it to his suitemate, Travis.<br />
<br />
‘ Riley: Hey Travis! Man, check this link out!<br />
<br />
With that typed, Riley reluctantly went back to studying. After around thirty minutes or so, a strange feeling washed over him. Riley stood up from his desk, wobbling slightly and falling to the floor. He hit the ground and his eyes shot wide open. He stared down at his feet as his socks began to lengthen; the fabric beginning to stretch and tear. He reached down to pull them off and stopped as he saw white fur growing on the backs of his hands.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, this is unreal!”<br />
<br />
The fur on his hands began to spread up his arms. His fingernails darkened as his palms began to grow puffy. His socks finally gave way with a loud RRRRIPP as his fluffy paws burst through. Using his claws, Riley stripped away the torn pieces of clothing as he began to heat up. He didn’t sweat, but he felt like he needed to. Instead, he began to pant. His clothes were too hot for him for some reason. He reached a paw hand up to his neck and threw off his shirt.<br />
<br />
His entire chest was covered with a thick fluffy coat of white fur. He continued to pant as he felt the fur creep down his back as well to his shorts. He felt a strange arousal as a small nub formed at the base of his spine and grew out into a long fur-covered tail. His tail began to wag back and forth with glee as his face began to change.<br />
<br />
“Ohrr, mry! Trrrrravvisss! Mran urrr…grrrr…”<br />
<br />
Riley attempted to call for his suitemate, but found it to become increasingly difficult with the onset of his new muzzle. Riley’s nose pushed out, growing dark and becoming wet and cold like a dog’s nose. He growled, unable to make out English words anymore. With a whimper and whine, Riley felt his ears beginning to change. His ears grew into large proud points and began to move up his head. His hair began to turn the same thick white as the rest of his body and retracted; becoming just another part of his fur coat.<br />
<br />
Riley was rapidly becoming a dog, and knew he’d be in trouble if he kept his shorts on. Whining, he tried to take off his shorts with his paws, but it was difficult. The fur had grown up to his nether regions, and the heat was unbearable. He clawed at the fabric until it tore off then got onto his forepaws, shaking. Eventually his shorts slid off, but not his underwear. His panting slowed, the cool air of the apartment on his fur made him smile. He looked at his new canine body and barked.<br />
<br />
‘Wow…guess that spell really did work! I’m a German Shepard!’<br />
<br />
Riley’s ears twitched and swiveled as he heard the opening of a door as his suitemate, Travis had come home.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Riley? You here?”<br />
<br />
The new dog Riley heard his friend call for him and sit down at his computer from the other room, and whined.<br />
<br />
‘Aw, I wanna show Travis what I found.’<br />
<br />
That’s when he remembered what he had sent him. His new canine ears then began to hear a familiar chant coming from the other side of the door…</p>
