<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">.... your kids are infected - they'll become anime-style toon mice too.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as Dr. Norri said that, it happened! Darryl and Diane became anime-style cartoon mice. Notably, Diane's eyes looked like the eyes of a <br />
shojo girl (shojo is romance manga/anime), her breasts were bigger and her hips were wider, but no more so than any typical shojo girl's. She <br />
and her brother seemed to have rodent incisors that always showed even with closed mouths. Diane had mixed feelings about her new body. <br />
On the one hand, she liked her now perfect hourglass shape - too bad it included a tail, rodent incisors, and big ears. Darryl liked being an <br />
anime-style cartoon mouse-boy - he thought it was cool. At least their clothes had shrunk with them - not that any of them needed clothes <br />
with all that fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told about how this happened,&quot; Dr. Norri said, kneeling down to be closer to them &quot;and I'm afraid that you're all stuck like this. You see, <br />
when you were cartoon mice the first time, it got imprinted into your DNA, and when you came out of Hellivision and touched your kids, they <br />
became infected too. Normally, this would've taken a number of years, but coming here sped up the process. There is some good news - the <br />
rules of the real world and Hellivision don't apply here, so you can't be killed, and you can't die. Take me for example: I've been here since <br />
1965, and I don't look a day past my 20's. You'll literally have forever to be a family and have fun together. You just won't get any older. I guess <br />
you could call this, as alchemists would put it, Equivalent Exchange. This is perhaps one of the most extreme cases of it, but at least you didn't <br />
lose an arm or leg like a certain blonde boy I know. His younger brother is worse off yet - he lost his entire body! So you Knables are very <br />
lucky!<br />
<br />
&quot;You call THIS lucky?&quot; Diane said, pointing at her teeth &quot;How come Darryl and I have teeth like this, but mom and dad don't?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dr. Norri said with a sweat drop on her face &quot;it's got nothing to do with genetics. That's a rule that doesn't necessarily apply here - it <br />
may at times, but not necessarily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Roy started, still trying to absorb all this info &quot;how much do we owe you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After what you've all been through,&quot; she said with an understanding look on her face &quot;I won't charge you anything. It's free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Helen, relieved to hear this &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it,&quot; Dr. Norri said smiling &quot;and here's a guide to tell you more about being a toon, so you'll know how your bodies work. Some <br />
of the things you may already know, but it's still pretty useful for first-timers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dr. Norri,&quot; Roy said, as he accepted the guide that was bigger than his body &quot;but how will I fit this in my pocket?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little thing called 'hammer-space'.&quot;, Dr Norri said, smiling &quot;It means you've got infinite space in your pockets, bags, and other things - it's <br />
pretty standard among toons.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Roy stuffed the whole thing in his back pocket, and there was no evidence that anything was in there! &quot;Great gouda!&quot; Roy exclaimed &quot;I could <br />
get used to this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That reminds me.&quot; Dr. Norri said, hearing what Roy just exclaimed &quot;You'll all start acting more like cartoons, and thinking like them too. You'll <br />
still be 'yourselves', and keep your memories, but the way you act will be more exaggerated - you may even lose your sanity at times, but you'll <br />
never lose your love for eachother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's gonna be a long way to walk back.&quot; Darryl noted, cleaning his glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about that.&quot; Dr. Norri assured him &quot;Just reach into your pocket.&quot;<br />
<br />
Helen was the first one to do this, and pulled out a black hole. &quot;A hole?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just like in cartoons.&quot; Roy said &quot;Just think of where you want to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Helen said &quot;I'd like to go back to our hotel room.&quot; and with that, she looked in the hole, and their room was there on the other side. <br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; she exclaimed &quot;this will save a lot on gas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing.&quot; Dr. Norri said &quot;Because you're all like this now, you can't live in the real world anymore, so you'll have to move to the <br />
ToonWorld. If you miss the real world that much, then I recommend moving here to the AnimeLand district - you'll find it's structurally identical <br />
to the real world, with some differences of course. You can always invite your friends to visit you, we have jobs here, and even schools so your <br />
children can finish their education. We'll get you all moved in when you settle on a place, but for now, just enjoy the rest of your vacation.<br />
<br />
With that, they waved goodbye, thanked Dr. Norri, and went through the hole to their hotel room. When they got there, Helen took the hole, <br />
and stuffed it back into her pocket. They found that everything in the room was now just the right size for them. Roy then pulled out the guide, <br />
and began reading it to his wife and kids. After hearing it - especially the part about anime - Diane was even more concerned. &quot;So let me get <br />
this straight,&quot; she asked &quot;not only do we automatically regenerate if we lose limbs, get blown up or cut into pieces, but if we exhibit extreme <br />
emotions, we'll super-deform into chibis? Sure that's only temporary, but aren't we small enough already? Never mind that, what about living <br />
forever? How can I live with myself knowing all my friends will die and I'll be left without any?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can always make new friends.&quot; Darryl suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I have a boyfriend like this?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find someone Diane.&quot; Helen said, patting her on her shoulder &quot;You just have to have faith. I'll bet you'll find a cute guy mouse just your <br />
size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Diane asked with anime sparkles in her eyes &quot;I'll bet he's a real great hunk of cheddar!&quot; At this, she covered her mouth &quot;Oh no! It's <br />
starting already!&quot; she said, worried &quot;My mind is becoming more toony, isn't it? I don't wanna be insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, dear.&quot; Helen said trying to comfort her &quot;We'll all be insane, but we'll still love you.&quot; at this, a screw fell out of Helen's right ear. Roy <br />
picked it up and handed it back to Helen who just smiled, and put it back in her head &quot;I guess I already have a few loose screws.&quot; Helen said <br />
smiling with a sweat drop on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; Roy said &quot;Let's not even THINK about any of that stuff - let's just have fun as a family. That's why we're here, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
So the Knables talked about it, and reached a decision, but what will they do now?</p>
