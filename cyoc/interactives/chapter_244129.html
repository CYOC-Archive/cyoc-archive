<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;C.O., when&#39;s chow?&quot; Henry yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here Amberhill, damn,&quot; a S.P.E.A.R prison officer grunted in annoyance. &quot;You know the drill. 12 feet back and wait until the trap is secured.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry Amberhill grumbled, taking a seat on his bunk as the C.O. now slid the evening meal through the trap door of the werewolves cell. As the trap locked, Amberhill stood, marching over to the tray before yanking the top off. At least dinner was decent tonight, baked half chicken with rice and veggies. Amberhill found that prison food wasn&#39;t exactly pleasant.<br />
<br />
Taking a seat on his bunk, Amberhill now gazed out of his cell. When S.P.E.A.R designed the cell blocks they made sure it was made from reinforced plexiglass, strong enough to withstand some of the strongest entities known to man. The 15×20 cell was essentially Amberhill&#39;s home, containing a toilet, sink, and bed. Thankfully the toilet at least had some privacy, but that was it. S.P.E.A.R was taking no chances in the over one hundred entities they had imprisoned within this cell block.<br />
<br />
Security cameras were everywhere with guard tours spaced 15 minutes apart. Amberhill had been paying attention to the guards movements since his arrival, finding that these C.O.&#39;s monitored the inmates carefully. Inmates had no chance to try and make any sort of contraband and even if they did, cell shakedowns were done regularly. The only time Amberhill was allowed out was for 2 hours of recreation and shower time each day.<br />
<br />
Even then though, Amberhill was in restraints. C.O.&#39;s took zero chances of a break out, using a 3 to 1 ratio anytime any inmate was out of their cell for their one hour recreation time. Twice a day, Amberhill was secured and escorted to the shower/recreation area where he would be secured. Henry, at first, thought escaping would be easy. That idea, though, was quickly dashed.<br />
<br />
Amberhill&#39;s first week saw him introduced to what S.P.E.A.R. referred to as Omega Squads. These Squads were specifically formed to control any and all prisoners disruptions. When Amberhill attempted to escape by assaulting two C.O.&#39;s during a rec period, Omega was called.<br />
<br />
There were a total 10 members, each clothed in heavy body armor complete with skull helmets. Henry didn&#39;t know who or even what they were. All he knew is that they were well armed and powerful. The massive werewolf was quickly subdued with about as much effort as a parent picking up a toddler. After that and being placed in a black box restraint chain, Amberhill realized it would be best to just go along with the flow.<br />
<br />
&quot;C.O. isn&#39;t it time for my second rec?&quot; Henry called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try Amberhill,&quot; the C.O. chuckled. &quot;I checked the logbook before chow. You already came out twice today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry huffed in annoyance, grabbing a book as he began to read. It was worth a shot, sometimes the C.O.&#39;s didn&#39;t check thoroughly, allowing Henry to sneak out for an extra rec period. As it stood, Effie and Trisha would be coming out tonight. Maybe when they came out he could ask them to get him some hot water for coffee.<br />
<br />
Pausing in his reading, he gazed at the cell across from him. Trisha sat there, looking frightened but doing her level best to remain calm. After years of faithfully serving the Amberhills, she never expected to end up here. Henry felt somewhat bad about his loyal employee&#39;s fate, but quickly shook the thought from his head. She knew what she was signing up for.<br />
<br />
Finishing his meal, Henry now placed his tray back on the trap. On the next tour the C.O. would retrieve it. Prison was all about routine and sadly Henry was now learning that. This was why he panicked as the cell block suddenly went black.<br />
<br />
Letting out a startled yell, Henry now pressed himself against his plexiglass prison. Gazing into the inky darkness it was impossible to tell what was going on. Lights out wasn&#39;t until the end of the shift. Their was no reason for things to be this dark. A voice that now echoed through the cell block made Henry&#39;s blood run cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really think I would forget?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry shuddered. It couldn&#39;t be! What was she doing here? How had she broken in? S.P.E.A.R. wouldn&#39;t allow civilians to enter this area, it was too dangerous. Looking across, he could see Trisha doing the same thing as he was, fearfully gazing down the darkened corridor. Both gasped in horror as a plague mask emerged from the darkness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Misery,&quot; he whispered in alarm.<br />
<br />
Misery slowly emerged, dressed in her leather duster and dark clothing. It was unnerving watching her as it seemed like the shadows were giving birth to the dark wizard. Slowly she strode to Henry&#39;s cell before stopping. Although the mask concealed the wizard&#39;s face, he could feel her eyes burning into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amberhill,&quot; she said, her voice low, ethereal, and threatening. &quot;As long as you live, my family will not be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The werewolf now gasped as he noticed inky tendrils slither their way into his cell. These tendrils moving like snakes, forcing Henry to retreat to the rear of his cell. Once more Henry screamed for the guards drawing a chuckle from Misery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Killing me won&#39;t solve anything,&quot; Henry growled.<br />
<br />
At this Misery paused the tendrils perhaps a foot away from Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right werewolf,&quot; Misery whispered. Henry breathed a sigh of relief as the shadowy tendrils retreated out of his cell. Misery stood their for a moment, a feeling of dread washing over him as she slowly turned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death is too easy,&quot; she said. &quot;But, watching your assistant torn to pieces as you can do nothing. That....that is a punishment befitting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Henry exclaimed, as he began banging on his cell.<br />
<br />
Misery ignored Henry&#39;s calls, approaching the frightened kitsune. Trisha backed away to the farthest corner, pressing herself tightly against the wall as the shadows entered her cell. Henry could do little more than curse and scream, as the tendrils now wrapped around Trisha&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the one who trapped me,&quot; Misery hissed. &quot;Tried to take my family away. Made me feel helpless....because you were doing your job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trisha gagged as the shadows wrapped tighter. Two more now formed from the darkness, wrapping around the kitsune&#39;s wrist pulling them to nearly their breaking point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch Amberhill,&quot; Misery growled. &quot;Watch as I tear your loyal assistant to pieces. When that&#39;s done...I&#39;ll do the same to your daughter. Tear her to pieces.... slowly as you watch helpless. Then...I will leave you to wallow in your misery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry screamed for the guards, the werewolf using all his strength to try and breakout of his plexiglass prison. Things seemed hopeless. In moments, Trisha would be little more than a stain on the prison floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get on the floor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry and Misery turned, watching as the C.O.&#39;s now sprinted into the block. The werewolf could hear the dark wizard growl under her mask. Quickly releasing her hold on Trisha, Misery lashed out. The shadows slamming into the guards like solid fists, knocking some of them backwards.<br />
<br />
The ones not hit by Misery&#39;s attack, now grabbed onto the wizard&#39;s arms, attempting to restrain her. Misery writhed in anger attempting to shake off her attackers. Unfortunately for the wizard, she was still human and possessed human strength.<br />
<br />
The guards now attempted to place Misery in handcuffs, deploying pepper spray to try and incapacitate the wizard. Henry&#39;s eyes now stung as the gas wafted through the block. The werewolf now retreated further into his cell as a single, imposing figure strolled down the corridor. Henry knew immediately who this was.<br />
<br />
A member of Omega Squad.<br />
<br />
The figure now moved to assist the guards. Gripping Misery by her jacket, the figure delivered a devastating nerve strike, knocking Misery unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take her to seg and inform Director Meyers of the break in,&quot; one of the C.O.&#39;s said.<br />
<br />
Henry watched as Misery was now dragged away as the member of Omega Squad stood in the middle of the block. This dark Sentinel would remain until Misery was processed and placed in a cell. All Henry could do now was exchange a concerned look with Trisha. Both knew that any attempt to escape was fruitless. For the foreseeable future, the Amberhills were stuck.</p>
