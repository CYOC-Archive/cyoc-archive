<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria laughed as she talked with her friends before science class. The group found her latest adventure with her step mom and her unborn sister to be hilarious. “Cmon guys it wasn’t that funny,” she laughed. “Glo,” Sasha giggled. “You ended up pregnant and thought your mom was you kid. Of course it’s funny.”<br />
<br />
Gloria blushed as her friends now playfully joked with her about the situation. While at first very concerned at what happened the girls were happy that it had a happy ending. Now, it was time to make fun of their friend for being pregnant in a way that only friends could. Gloria now shook her head and smiled, as fun as this was the girls needed to talk about their plans Friday.<br />
<br />
“Okay Seriously now,” she sighed, trying to get the others attention. “We’re all in on date night Friday right?”<br />
<br />
“Can’t wait,” Naomi exclaimed. “We’re still bowling right? Cause me and Diane have actually been practicing.” <br />
<br />
“Definitely looking forward to it,” Felicia smiled. “Adam actually wants to turn it into a whole weekend. I mean we’ve been dating for two months, he so sweet he wants to take me out to eat somewhere nice with his family.”<br />
<br />
The girls awed at Adams kindness before turning to Jackie. “What about you Jackie,” Felicia asked. “You think your GIRLFRIEND will be joining us?” Jackie quickly tried to shush the others as she turned bright red. “Quiet,” she hissed. “You know I really can’t do anything with her. She’s busy this weekend we were thinking of getting together later this month when it’s closer to Valentines Day.”<br />
<br />
“That kind of sucks,” Naomi sighed. “I mean seriously how can you stand it? Isn’t it hard you know..for you two to be together, all things considered?”<br />
<br />
Jackie sighed in frustration as she now thought of Ann. While her friends knew of her relationship with Ann they understood that it was complicated. Ann was an adult while Jackie was still a teen, while the two cared about each other they both came to a conclusion that unless magical means were employees they would wait until Jackie was older to be in an open relationship. Gloria could see her friends frustration and gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “I know it sucks Jackie,” she sighed. “We all wish it could be different but just know we all support you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks guys,” Jackie smiled weakly. <br />
<br />
“So if you and Ann were to marry Jackie does that mean Gloria has to call you Aunt Jackie,” Diane joked. Gloria frowned as the others now began to laugh once more. “Well hope you guys have fun,” Sasha sighed. “Just, give me a call Saturday when it’s over. I’ll be right back, got to ask Mr. Scott a question.” Without another word Sasha stood up, slowly walking towards the girls science teacher Mr. Scott. “Poor Sasha,” Felicia whispered.<br />
<br />
Ever since the girls began dating Sasha had found herself to be the odd man out, while the others tried to include her in their group dates Sasha often felt awkward when she tagged along. After awhile Sasha began to look for ways to avoid these dates, coming up with a myriad of excuses and staying home by herself. “We should really try to set her up with someone,” Diane stated. “We could but she would probably kill us if we did,” Naomi added. “You know how stubborn she is. She would see it as a pity date and be mad.” As the girls continued to debate trying to help Sasha, Gloria noticed Jackie now beckon her to the side.<br />
<br />
“What is it Jackie,” Gloria asked. Jackie looked around quickly before speaking. “Glo have you thought about useing the ring to help her?” Gloria looked down at her ring, to be honest she hadn’t really thought of doing something like that for her. “I don’t know Jackie,” she whispered. “I mean I guess I could but who though?” Jackie now motioned towards Mr. Scott. “Why not him,” she said. “Mr. Scott has always liked Sasha and science is one of the few classes Sasha really tries hard in. They might actually be really good together.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think he’s her type though,” Gloria questioned, “I mean Sasha likes wrestling, cars, and MMA. Mr. Scott is kind of a science geek.”<br />
<br />
“Opposites attract Gloria,” Jackie stated.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Gloria shrugged. “Let’s give it a try.” Looking down at her ring Gloria now wished for Mr. Scott to become a freshman boy.<br />
<br />
Mr. Riley Scott was an older teacher, just shy of his 70th birthday. Mr. Scott’s weathered face possessed whispy gray hair with dark green eyes. The man appeared to be in decent shape despite his age with a thin waist and well built but narrow upper body. As Gloria and Jackie now watched the man they could see him slowly beginning to grow younger.<br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first. Mr. Scott’s wrinkles seemed to lessen as  he grew younger. By the time he passed 60 the girls began to notice his grey hair beginning to regain its original sandy brown  color. As Mr. Scott left his 50s and reentered his 40s the girls noticed his hair regain its original sandy brown color while his face was now wrinkle free. “Hmm he’s kind of cute in a dorky way,” Gloria commented. Jackie nodded as they continued to watch the man age backwards.<br />
<br />
Quickly Mr. Scott raced through his 30s and reentered his 20s. Gloria could see the man appeared to have slightly wild hair with a thin build. Mr. Scott’s glasses seemed to slide on his face and the girls watched as he pushed them back into place. The man did have a handsome face with a firm jaw despite his gangly appearance. If Jackie and Gloria were to describe him, they would say he looked like a young mad scientist. Still Mr. Scott grew younger.<br />
<br />
As he returned to college and high school the girls watched as he became even skinnier while his hair seem3 to grow shaggier. The boy had an impish face with thick glasses with a mop of wild sandy brown hair. Mr. Scott also appeared to be quite thin for his age. Despite this he still appeared boyishly handsome in his own way.<br />
<br />
As he descended into his mid teens the girls watched as he relieved a growth spurt in reverse. The boy now stood slightly shorter than Sasha. As his regression completed, leaving him 15 the girls saw a skinny boy with a cute face and wild sandy brown hair. Mr. Scott, now Riley, blinked as he looked at the tough girl in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Sasha,” he said blushing. “How have you been.”<br />
<br />
“Oh hey Riley,” Sasha said. “How’s your day going?” Riley shrugged as he now shyly looked towards the floor. “Pretty good so far,” he said meekly. “You got an plans this weekend?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh no,” she huffed. “My friends all of dates so I’m looking at a quiet night at home.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah Inwas talking with Nate he told me about the group date,” Riley said. “Which made me wonder, would you..um..like to go with me?”<br />
<br />
Sasha gaped at the boy before slugging him in the arm. “Ow,” he moaned, rubbing his arm. “Why you hit me?”<br />
<br />
“Your seriously asking me out,” she exclaimed. “Why? How? Who put you up to this?” <br />
<br />
“No one,” Riley said defensively hold his hands up. “But ummm I always thought you were cool and all it sounded like fun sooo you want to go, with me?” Sasha paused as she gazed at the boy. Secretly she had to admit she did like the boy, his wild hair, quiet nature, and quirky sense of humor definitely interested her. She had never thought he would be interested in a girl like her though. Riley always seems like the kind of guy who would end up dating some mousy bookworm. Smiling, she now grabbed the boy by his shirt planting a kiss on him. “Sounds like fun,” she smirked. “This better not be a joke though or I’ll pummel you.”<br />
<br />
Riley stammered a response as Sasha spun back towards her friends, a broad smile on her face. “Great job Gloria,” Jackie smiled. “She looks really happy.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I think we did good,” Gloria smiled. “Just don’t tell Sasha what we did, pretty sure she would stuff us in a locker.”</p>
