<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wondering through the deserted streets, darting into the shadows if he heard anything, <br />
Ben knew he'd have to find some clothes fast as he could see the sky lightning in the East.<br />
<br />
He knew that it he was to far away to go to his or one of his friends homes, so he'd have <br />
to steal something to wear. He wasn't keen on the idea, but it was that or to walk through <br />
the streets with his donkey appendages in clear view for all to see. Looking down he also <br />
noticed that he'd been running in his socks, he'd must of lost his shoes when he got out of <br />
the window.<br />
<br />
He'd been running for some time, and he was now well clear of the City center, and he was <br />
now down a back alley, behind some houses.<br />
<br />
It was then he noticed that in one of the back gardens, someone must of accidentally left <br />
their washing out, and on the line were a of pair of dark blue tracksuit bottoms and some <br />
boxers. Without thinking, Ben clambered over the fence and grabbed them off the line. It <br />
hit him that  he had just manage to scale a fence with no effort at all. Cautiously <br />
examining his body, he realised just how muscular he had become.  Lifting his tight shirt, <br />
he saw that muscles adorned his arms and torso. It looked like he'd been working out for <br />
years. It was astonishing. Moving his hands across his hairy stomach, he could feel his <br />
now well defined six pack. Next he examined his new equipment. Gently pulling down his <br />
darker sheath, he examined he new dick. It was was more like a donkeys then a humans <br />
he thought sadly, but it shear size and girth certainly made up for it. His balls had also ad <br />
the Donk treatment as well, and were now the size of tennis balls, and were covered in <br />
thick brow hair.<br />
<br />
After admiring his body for a while, he noticed that the sky was getting lighter, snapping <br />
out of it, he grabbed the trackies and one par of the boxer shorts. Looking at them, they <br />
looked as though they belonged to a well built guy. Looking at his bigger body, he hoped <br />
that they'd fit.<br />
<br />
Firstly he pulled on the boxers, as they got to his waist, he had to give them a firm tug <br />
over his now bigger balls. Pulling them up as far as he could, he noticed that his donkey <br />
sheath was still protruding well above the elastic. He knew it would be a bad idea to try to <br />
pull the boxers up further, so he just let it be. Reaching behind him, he stuffed his tail <br />
down the back of the boxers, getting a cold shiver down his back as he felt the mass of <br />
hair that now adorned his arse.<br />
<br />
Pulling on the trackies, he examined his lower half. Fortunately, the trackes just fitted but <br />
they left little to the imagination, especially with the huge bulge in the crotch area. But he <br />
actually admired that Pulling his shirt back down, covering the opening of his sheath, Ben <br />
breathed a sigh of relief; until he realised that he'd have to find a hat and something for <br />
his feet.<br />
<br />
Looking around the garden, he noticed that there was a old outhouse next to the house, <br />
maybe there would be something in there. Creeping over, he saw that the door was <br />
padlocked. He wondered, could he force the door open with his found strength? There was <br />
only one way to find out!<br />
<br />
Standing back a little, he rushed forward, putting all of his body weight upon the old door. <br />
It was too much for it and it came off his hinges. Quickly grabbing it, before it fell and <br />
made a noise, Ben propped it against the wall.<br />
<br />
Peering in, he saw that the out house was crammed with gardening tools and equipment, <br />
clearly this guy was a keen gardener. But then Ben saw that to his delight, on one of the <br />
shelves was a old skull cap. He pulled it onto his head, then tucked his ears under it. <br />
Looking down on the floor, there were also a new pair of tan Rigger Boots in the corner. <br />
They looked like a size 12, so he hoped that they'd at least fit his bigger feet.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the bench in the garden, he pulled on the left one first. To his relief, wiggling <br />
the toes against the steel toe cap revealed that they were a snug fit. Pulling on the right <br />
boot, he breathed a sigh of relief. Getting back on to the ally, he felt a little better now <br />
that all of his donkey parts were covered and that he almost looked normal, except for <br />
that bulge in his crotch and looking a little odd in builders boots. Thinking about his <br />
situation, Ben pondered about what he was going to do, the sun was now rising and he <br />
knew that they were probably after him now.</p>
