<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;All right boys, looks like we&#39;re out of luck. Engines busted and looked like the coast guard can&#39;t tow us till the morning&quot; Came a scratchy, age worn voice over the PA.<br />
<br />
Quiet filled the cabin, punctuated by the occasional murmur of confusion. Disappointment crossed each of its occupants faces. <br />
<br />
For the past 60 years, the Morristown high senior cruise treated the newly graduated students to one last night of fun with their classmates before they were sent off into the heavy world of adulthood. Well-funded by an annual fundraising drive, the cruise was an all-night affair that treated the students to endless food, dancing, (non-alcoholic drinks) and a few stops at select ports along the southern coast of Lake Superior. <br />
<br />
Events like these were rare for the people of Morristown. Situated on the Arrowhead of Minnesota, just 10 miles north of the Wisconsin border, Morristown was the archetypal rustbelt tragedy. The industrialization of the 1920s had made Morristown a center of commerce. Shipping lanes throughout the Great Lakes had once converged here, taking advantage of the town&#39;s geographical location at the center of the continent and the proximity of the seemingly endless iron mines. The boom of iron fueled wealth that flooded the city earned it the moniker &quot;the rusty diamond.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the mines dried up, however, only the &quot;rusty&quot; part of that nickname seemed to fit. The towns descent was a slow one, iron range folk are a tenacious bunch, however, its future was predestined. With little to attract investment, the town was doomed to a future of poverty and decaying remnants of what once was. <br />
<br />
The senior lake cruise, however, remained a source of town pride. While the people couldn&#39;t afford much, every year they doled out money to do just this one special thing for its students. They didn&#39;t have much, but at least they had this night. Normally, it would be a night students would remember for years to come. Normally. <br />
<br />
Tonight&#39;s trip had hit a snag. Quit literally. As the boat was traversing one of the lakes many Stoney inlets a trawling net caught itself in the motor. Normally this would be fixable, however, the motor had seen better days and the combined force of the netting and a rusty crack that had developed on the motor&#39;s exterior cause the blades to rip off. The boat was rendered inoperable. <br />
<br />
luckily for the occupants, the boat just happened to be passing an oddly well-lit island. One the captain noted was not on any of the navigation charts, yet one he was glad to see, nonetheless.  Using the sheer force of the boat&#39;s momentum at the moment of the engines crack the captain was able to steer the ship into the islands harbor where he was able to use some light signals to communicate to the Habor master that he&#39;d need help getting his passengers to shore.<br />
<br />
The captain, Jerry Porter, was a veteran of these waters and was used to technical difficulties. He&#39;d piloted this very cruise for the last 20 years and while they&#39;d had their share of accidents, he&#39;d never had an accident that was so easily resolved. Normally engine trouble meant breaking out the space blankets and sleeping pads and hunkering in for the night while they waited for the coast guard to find them. Tonight, it seemed, some kind of karma was paying out. Everything was coming together. <br />
<br />
Once the rescue boats were on their way from shore, Jerry dropped the anchor and decided to greet the students. He knew they&#39;d be disappointed and hoped whatever fun they could find on this island could help salvage the night. With a sigh, Jerry rubbed a hand over his face, the scratch of the greying stubble tickling his fingers. Slowly he lifted himself from his captain&#39;s chair and walked down the hall to the cabin. <br />
<br />
In his mid 50s, Jerry was something of a silver fox. Packed with muscle, a taste of fat, and a full head of thick grey hair, he felt he was the best his age group had to offer. In spite of this, Jerry was alone. Never married, he&#39;d devoted himself to his passion for boating and the love for this lake.  As he made his way into his 50s, however, he found that love somewhat - empty. He realized the chances he&#39;d wasted and the romances he&#39;d avoided in his youth. He was never sure why the idea of romance and settling down with a wife never fit right, but age had made sure he realized that without a relationship - life simply lacked a certain spark.   As he entered the cabin and saw the students, he couldn&#39;t help but remember his own senior cruise and the hope and promise he&#39;d felt that night. Tonight, was shaping up to be a disaster, but he knew he had to do right by these kids. If this truly was their peak, as it had been his, he wanted it to be special.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys, as you know we&#39;ve got some pretty serious engine trouble.&quot; He paused, taking in the disappointed looks. &quot;I know Tonight is normally the highpoint of most Morristown boy&#39;s high school experience. You boys have been looking forward to this all year and I hate to ruin your fun, but reality is reality and I suppose there is no better introduction to adulthood than a ruined night.&quot;<br />
<br />
He meant this as a joke and was sure to punctuate it with a chuckle. The students, however, took it all too seriously. They knew the futures they had in front of them. Most would end up in what was left of the mines, another group would go into logging, and a lucky few would escape south to Minneapolis to trek eastward to Chicago. Their futures were not bright and tonight seemed to be just the tip of that iceberg. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good news is that the ship has broken down right of the coast of what looks like a well populated island. Normally in such circumstances we&#39;d be sleeping on the floor. Instead, I bet we&#39;ll be able to arrange some nice warm beds, or at the very least - cots.&quot;<br />
<br />
The faces were somewhat relieved by this, but the overall tenor of the meeting was sour. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Harbor master has sent some boats from the shore, and they should be here momentarily. Now the current plan is to - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, a message from the harbor master&quot; Came a voice. A member of the crew entered and handed a small card to the captain. <br />
<br />
He studied it a moment, and his eyebrow peaked. A slight smile of relief crossed his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s that karma again&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;I don&#39;t know what is in the air tonight, but everything just seems to be working out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it say?&quot; came a voice. Something good had clearly happened, the students could see it on the captain&#39;s face. He couldn&#39;t help but smile at this, the kids were bright. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well boys it looks like we have some good news! If I&#39;m reading this right, it sounds like this here island is the new home of a recently opened amusement park.&quot; Jerry squinted at the card briefly, the name of the park was somewhat smudged in the quickly scrawled chickenscratch of the crewmember. &quot;err....I can&#39;t quite make it out, but it&#39;s called something-island. Turns out its their opening weekend and after hearing our predicament the owner has agreed to offer us free tickets, in addition to room and board for as long as we require.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was suddenly filled with smiles. Jerry couldn&#39;t help but smile himself. Not only was the evening saved but depending on the Coast Guard&#39;s schedule the fun of the night could be extended into the weekend. Glancing out a window, he saw the rescue boats approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, looks like our ride is here. Now here&#39;s the plan boys, I&#39;m not wanting to play chaperone the whole night and I think it&#39;ll be good for you to use this night to really let loose. Explore your newfound freedom. You are adults, and you should be able to handle yourselves. Go have fun. The only rule I&#39;ll have is to meet me at say-11pm - by the boat so I can get a head count and make sure we all find our way to bed. Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded more than good. While the cruise was certainly going to be fun, it was still well regulated. They would have had a night of partying under the watchful eye of the captain, his crew, and the handful of chaperones who&#39;d volunteered to keep an eye. Instead, it seemed, they were getting a night of rides, games, and unrestricted fun. Tonight, was truly going to be something special. <br />
<br />
&quot;The boats are here, so line up and start deboarding. I want you kids to have a night of fun, so let&#39;s get off this broken ship and embrace the night!&quot; Excitement was palpable in the captain&#39;s voice and the mood had clearly shifted towards the better. A few cheers went up and a smattering of clapping could be heard from the more appreciative students. <br />
<br />
__________<br />
<br />
As the boys lined up and the crew helped them onto the harbor masters&#39; boats, Jerry felt a firm hand grip his arm. Turning, he found himself staring into a set of angry verging on furious eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; the man said, a quiver of unrestrained emotion seeping into each word. &quot;Just letting them go off on their own like that?! What if someone gets hurt? Lost? These aren&#39;t adults, they&#39;re kids!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Last I checked, Ned, they&#39;re all 18, have diplomas in hand, and quite a few will be starting jobs in a matter of days. What&#39;s the problem here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The problem? The PROBLEM?!&quot; replied Ned, a vessel bulging in his forehead &quot;I&#39;m the head of the PTA, the VOICE of these kid&#39;s parents. How do you think I&#39;ll be able to explain that instead of the well supervised evening of fun THEY paid for , we just decided to let the kids run free in some amusement park no one&#39;s ever heard of???&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Again, Ned. They&#39;re not kids, they&#39;re adults now. Last I checked, 18 was old enough to vote, let alone have the freedom to explore adulthood without parent involvement for just one night.&quot; Jerry brushed Ned&#39;s hand off his shoulder &quot;Besides, I thought the PTA was concerned with what activities the school was planning for students. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but none of these &#39;kids&#39; are students anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point, Ned&#39;s face was pure red. Tall and thin, each quiver of the man&#39;s nerves was visible even through his clean-cut shirt and tie.  While he was around the same age as Jerry, he wasn&#39;t quite as handsome. Age had twisted both his physicality and mentality into that off a &#39;dad.&#39; A bald spot could be seen through his grey-brown hair, a few liver spots dotted his arms, and the bifocals he wore at the tip of his nose completed the look. While it was hard to see now, He had once been the star of the Morristown Lions football team and had actually played alongside Jerry. An injury at the end of his senior season had taken his   athleticism, replacing it with a steaming resentment and a lifetime of mild pain. <br />
<br />
Ned Gunderson&#39;s general attitude was no anomaly in Morristown. Most who stayed lived with their own pains, collected from years of poverty and hopelessness. Rather than confront these pains, however, the town papered them over. An embrace of strict moralism and conservative principals allowed the community to channel its frustrations. If they couldn&#39;t have a good life, well at least they could ensure an upright community. <br />
<br />
Morristown high&#39;s student body was a reflection of this. The institution was one of the few all boys&#39; high schools left in the country, paired with the all-girls Morristown <i> Senior High </i>. The separation of the sexes was championed by the town&#39;s PTA and school board a like. The town held a deeply rooted conviction that the separation of the sexes was essential for a good education. Separating boys and girls meant no sex, no dating, and undivided attention towards their studies. <br />
<br />
Naturally, the idea that sex could be avoided by separating the students made sense in theory but failed in practice. Teens knew what they wanted and if they wanted the opposite sex - they would find it. The segregation also led students to vent their sexual frustration through - experimentation. While the city preferred to turn a blind eye towards the <i> homosexuality problem </i>, it couldn&#39;t be totally ignored.  When the school board had decided to cut the arts budget, &#39;going to art class&#39; took on new meeting. Everyone knew what it meant when two boys walked into the abandoned arts classroom alone.<br />
<br />
In this fervently conservative environment, Ned had <i>earned </i> his status as PTA chair. His devotion to conservative principals and strict observance of traditional moral codes was well known and well respected. He chaired the local church&#39;s board, led the town food shelf, and was a staple at school board meetings. While he was strict and often harsh, people recognize that he truly did <i>care</i> underneath his strict exterior. The food drives were evidence of this, every year he would bend over backwards to ensure the local homeless population was cared for.  He was a staple in this community and when he ran for PTA chair, his candidacy was all but assured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think of the consequences your lack attitude can have for these boys? Imagine - they use their freedom to try a cigarette. A night of freedom could lead to a lifetime of addiction. Is <i> that</i> what you want Jerry?&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain grinned at this, while he knew cigarettes were harmful, trying one certainly wasn&#39;t enough to cause addiction. Ned may have been a powerful influence in this town, but that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t naive. <br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest Ned, I&#39;m hardly concerned. Over the years I&#39;ve seen you make so many mountains out of mole hills that i&#39;ve learned to just tune you out&quot;<br />
<br />
Ned balked. Few ever had the confidence to backtalk him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well! <i>Captain.</i> My son James certainly won&#39;t be leaving my sight tonight. I might not be able to control all of these kids, but I can sure as heck protect my own son&quot;<br />
<br />
This struck a chord with Jerry. He&#39;d noticed James earlier in the night. The diminutive boy had never left the sight of his dad and it clearly was affecting him. No one wanted to be near him and join him under Ned&#39;s surveillance and the helicopter parenting seemed to have left him with a general lack of confidence. Jerry&#39;s dad had been similar, and to this day he was still working on shaking off the mental scars that had left him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t stop you Ned, but just know, I&#39;m not helping you and I can assure you none of the boys are going to respect your authority much now that they&#39;ve graduated. You may have influence over your son, but that&#39;s as far as you&#39;re going to get tonight.&quot; On that note, Jerry decided he was done with Ned. He&#39;d known that man for over 30 years and knew his penchant for argument. This could go on for hours if he didn&#39;t cut things off. Without a word, he his back on Ned making his way to a chest that sat in the cabins corner to collect his things before he himself deboarded. <br />
<br />
Ned steamed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk tsk tsk Jerry, just you Wait until the PTA hears about this, I can assure you this is the last time you&#39;ll be leading this trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerry paused. <i>That</i> was something he cared about. He loved leading this trip. It was his one chance a year he felt hope and optimism. Seeing and <i>feeling</i> the joy of the students reminded him of his own cruise over 30 years earlier. Loosing this would mean losing the one spark of joy that helped him get through his year. <br />
<br />
Turning, he leered at Ned. &quot;What the <b>fuck</b> is your problem, Ned &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only looking out for what&#39;s best for this community&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The <i> community</i>?&quot; Jerry&#39;s voice grew louder. &quot;Is that truly what it&#39;s about? Something tells me this little fit has more to do with me taking your place as quarterback 30 years ago than any sort of morals. You know as well as I that even under the best supervision this cruise is all about kids sneaking shots of vodka, taking edibles and finally getting a taste of freedom. You&#39;ve had a problem with me since that first game I took centerfield.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know as well as I do that you never earned the right to that position. I was the <i> star</i>. I was gonna go pro. If it wasn&#39;t for that damn injury I&#39;d be out of this fucking town!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ned paused, realizing how loud he&#39;d gotten. Most students had by now deboarded and were making their way to shore, however, the few still on board stared. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. The true Ned Gunderson finally comes out. Never knew you hated this shithole as much as the rest of us Ned.&quot; Jerry sighed &quot;Well welcome to the fucking club. Least you could do is appreciate that this is the one night of hope most of these kids have left. You understand the pain they&#39;re gonna go through, can you at least give them this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ned was silent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Ned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Jerry, <i>why not</i>. I&#39;m too tired to fight. Just let the kids run free. You said yourself, this is their last night of dreams and hope. Why not let the learn the pain that hope and freedom brings them. I&#39;m gonna go find James and make sure he doesn&#39;t hurt himself. I&#39;ll leave it to you to tend to the accidents, lost students, and general rowdiness you know this is gonna create.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ned took a step towards the last boat that waited to take the crew to shore.  A shadowy figure stood on board and helped him in. Jerry soon joined him, judiciously placing his briefcase on the dinghy&#39;s bench to separate him and Ned. <br />
<br />
The trip to shore was brief and in minutes the two adults and remaining crew had stepped up on the dock. Not wasting a minute, Ned huffed and started on forward, determined to find where his son had run off to. In the heat of the argument Ned had failed to stop James from getting to shore before him. <br />
<br />
Grabbing his things, Jerry had his sights on finding a bed. He needed rest after the hour or two he&#39;d spent with these kids - and Ned - and intended to spend the night with his old pal Netflix. Walking down the dock he approached the park&#39;s gate. No tills stood in front, presumably tickets were to be bought on shore.  Past the gate lay a cascade of twinkling, inviting lights dotted the island. The place seemed huge. A long boardwalk stretched across the shore, teaming with busy stalls, games, and rides. At the park&#39;s northside rose a peaking bluff, a small light lined trail leading to its top where a strange bright green light twinkled. Jerry marveled at the spectacle. never would have  imagined such a place coming to the Iron Range. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way this thing&#39;s going to last till next year&quot; he mused.<br />
<br />
Reaching the gate, he looked up. While there were no tills, there was a sign announcing the park&#39;s strange name:<br />
<br />
<b> Pleasure Island </b><br />
<br />
Jerry smirked at this. It was a strange name, but a name that promised a good time. Jerry had a hard year and could use a little pleasure in his life. Even just for one night. Seeing the lights and hearing the noises of the park was starting to shift his mood. Maybe he&#39;d try having a little fun. The park was free after all. He could save Netflix for another night. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Karma, let&#39;s make it a good one. Don&#39;t let up on me yet.&quot; Walking forward, Jerry entered the park. <br />
<br />
Little did he know, Karma would indeed smile on him, and all the others, though not necessarily in a way they&#39;d expect.</p>
