An idea crossed nicks face as he slowly broke into a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, he said, pulling his face from the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like to be my bodyguard... or more accurately, the body guard of a 26 year old action movie star?&quot;, Nick asked, a crazy look of excitement flashing in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Chris thought for a moment, &quot;Why don&#39;t I get to be an action movie star, there&#39;s nothing saying you can&#39;t be the bodyguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s grin got bigger, feigning disappointment, &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want to carry a taser and gun around with a higher than average chance of using it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SOLD!&quot; Chris interjected. &quot;Let&#39;s do this, what do I click?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick laughed. Chris had always had an appreciation for guns that Nick simply didn&#39;t share or even begin to understand, he knew that Chris wouldn&#39;t be able to resist.<br />
<br />
The two of them huddled around the PC answering the questions that came up. Since it was a preset there were very few questions. For Chris, he had the option of getting his training through the military, or the police prior to becoming a bodyguard and working in the private sector, not knowing which to go with he chose both. He went into the military after High School and when he got out, he became a police officer. Next was the reality settings, world awareness was off and they couldn&#39;t change that, not that they understood it. Subject awareness had two options, a slider for a percentage, and an &quot;On Access&quot; method with a big question mark and &quot;New Feature!!!&quot; highlighted. <br />
<br />
The boys clicked the question mark and a popup read:<br />
As part of our beta version we are excited to present our On Access awareness shift! Our field trials have shown that the percentile awareness option doesn&#39;t always work as planned, sometimes leaving users without certain instincts, knowledge, or skills due to wanting to remain aware that this is an excursion with the Chronivac. This new option allows for awareness to drop, the more you utilize the new forms memories but will never go to 100%. Depending on how drastic of a change this is from their normal life, within the first week most users experience 10 to 75% reality shift. The rest of the month progresses them to somewhere between 30 and 85% and the rest of the first year is 50 to 95%. Only with years of intensive therapy would a subject  have the potential to actively explore enough aspects of the new personality to make the new awareness surpass 98%<br />
Well, that&#39;s why we&#39;re excited, But how does it work? Upon the initial transformation, you are still 99% original you, the only thing that has changed is your instincts and triggers. For example, if you decide you want to go out to eat, you get in your new car, and realize it is a manual transmission which you have never driven in. Then you start to remember being taught to drive stick as well. Without realizing there is a whole new batch of memories suddenly available to you upon needing to access one of them. When you are first transformed the entire new personality is set up, but then it is covered by your former personality, only able to be let go once certain key situations are met.<br />
This option is Highly recommended for lives that rely on trained instincts. Such as Military, law enforcement, sky diver instructor and so on.<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each-other, Chris said whatever and clicked the x, dismissing the popup. Then he selected the slider putting the percentage at 25%. <br />
<br />
Nick raised a fuss saying &quot;No! select the other option!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris gave a frown, &quot;But its the buggy beta option. I don&#39;t want to become a vegetable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick rolled his eyes,  Clicked the description and pointed out that this option is recommended for those relying on trained instincts and that with such a low grasp on the new reality he may not have the instincts to do the job, or knowledge of his own family, or something absurd like that.<br />
<br />
Chris selected the on access version on the condition that Nick do the same when his time comes.<br />
<br />
The next option was Reality Change, it was locked in the on position due to the nature of the profession, there was a small blurb stating that certain licenses were needed for this profession and should something happen, it would be best if the credentials were real.<br />
<br />
The final question was if he wanted to initiate change or select another subject for transformation. Nick was eager to get to being a movie star so he insisted they transform together pushing Chris out of the way (easily, since Chris was much less pudgy than Nick and hadn&#39;t begun to gain the muscle that puberty brings.)<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be able to do that soon kid!&quot; Chris retorted, excited about becoming a well trained killing machine.<br />
<br />
Nick looked back giving a quick grin. &quot;Hold your horses, you will have YOUR gun soon.&quot; Making sure to emphasize that it will be Chris&#39; rightful possession, knowing it will trigger fantasies of rectifying all the perceived injustices he had suffered. He was too young to own a gun and his mother didn&#39;t want it in the house anyway. His father refused to take him to the shooting range because his grades were low. His parents tried to placate him with a slingshot, which only underscored how they didn&#39;t trust him.<br />
<br />
The only option that Nick really had to think about was if he was a new star or if he has been &quot;on the scene&quot; for a while. He chose new star. The rest of the settings were the same as Chris&#39;. Once he got to the reality change, the setting was already selected, and for obvious reasons, he couldn&#39;t change it. A new option popped up, after that to entwine subject 1 and subject 2&#39;s reality to make subject 1 the bodyguard of subject 2. This was chosen, as it was their plan all along.<br />
<br />
After selecting initiate changes, yet another popup appeared asking how the changes should feel for each subject. Orgasmic, pleasurable, nothing, painful, or horrifying. Nick thought for a brief second about setting Chris&#39; changes to horrifying but thought better of it, After all, having trust issues with your body guard is not a good way to start. He set both to orgasmic thinking it would be funny after the fact and clicked continue expecting another popup.<br />
<br />
The screen flickered for a second and then went black. A few seconds went by with nothing happening and Nick thought the program broke. Then three bars appeared titled mental changes, physical changes, and reality change. The mental change bar was already at 21% and steadily rising. <br />
<br />
Nick said, &quot;Okay, here is where we become vegetables!&quot; throwing a condescending grin at Chris, who looked a little worried. <br />
<br />
Just then Chris&#39; phone rang, &quot;Aw shit it&#39;s my mom.&quot; he said answering.<br />
<br />
Nick flailed his arms trying to indicate that speaking to someone while transforming is probably a bad idea, but Chris was too quick. Glancing back, Nick saw that the mental changes were chugging away at 81% and he anticipated the orgasmic physical changes would be starting within 10 seconds or so.  Nick could make out most of the conversation as his mom was angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, Where Are YOU?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m at Nick&#39;s&quot;<br />
&quot;And WHY isn&#39;t there a note on the fridge or a text on my phone so I don&#39;t think you are kidnapped?&quot;<br />
&quot;Shit, Uh, technical oversight?&quot;<br />
&quot;When did You start cursing?! Did Nick teach you this word?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, Fuck! I mean NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Nick was laughing, The instinctual changes hit Chris like a ton of bricks, Being in trouble with his mom put him on high alert, so all the foul mouthedness that was ingrained from boot camp was kicking in, Nick expected he was going to hear an awful lot of cussing until they decide to revert. He glanced back at the screen, 100% complete for mental, Physical 2% <br />
<br />
&quot;...so you march yourself back home This Instant. You are grounded for swearing at your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick looked at Chris whose face was turning red. He looked a tad taller, maybe older but Nick couldn&#39;t be sure. Chris needed to wrap this up, otherwise his mother will freak out when his voice starts dropping multiple octaves in a single conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t cussing at you, I was just cussing, there is a huge difference...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick whispered. &quot;Get rid of her, physical changes are starting!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as his mother was yelling &quot;There&#39;s no difference to me, mister, it&#39;s a sign of respect to watch what you say around your elders and you&#39;ve got no respect! Now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll be home in five.&quot; Chris cut her off and ended the call.<br />
<br />
He was clearly taller now and much more muscular with just a little bit of padding. &quot;She won&#39;t know wHo I Am in 4 mINutes.&quot; Chris said with a grin. His voice cracked as if to underscore his statement and both the boys laughed.<br />
<br />
Nick watched in awe as Chris seemed to suddenly burst out in all ways except his clothing, which seemed to grow with him. The progression was quick upon reaching late teens. Chris quickly reached his adult height, somewhere in the low 6&#39; area, While he finished gaining height he continued growing more muscular and added a thicker coating of insulation making him look fully capable of being a formidable professional football player. Somewhere between 17 and 20 years old Chris&#39; body erupted in hair. Though he was wearing shorts and a tee shirt it was obvious that the thick covering of hair didn&#39;t stop at his legs or arms. Nick watched Chris&#39; face as sideburns crawled down and chest hair seemed to crawl up his widening jaw which mingled on his face and suddenly blossomed into a glorious beard.  At this point Chris had to be in his early to mid 20 as he was showing more wrinkles while examining the changes occurring to Nick. There was a growing sense of pressure both the men were noticing, It had been steadily increasing and Nick remembered, he set the physical changes to be orgasmic.<br />
<br />
Nick grinned, as a confused and slightly concerned look crossed Chris&#39; face, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s only going to get better and stronger from here.&quot; Nicks own voice had dropped several octaves and settled seeing that he was halfway through and around 20. Nick&#39;s aging was a bit slower than Chris&#39; because he wasn&#39;t going to end up as old. Chris watched as Nick steadily grew in height and his weight distribution slowly shifted from a pudgy physique to a lean physique and somewhere in his late teens, Nick began bodybuilding but managed to stay lean.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s face changed throughout his accelerated puberty, It became thinner, like the rest of him and then he began growing facial hair. Although he kept clean shaven he had a permanent shadow in his beard area which seemed to make him look older. Chris watched his friends transition unfold before him, As Nick began building muscle his jaw widened making his face look more square. His teeth magically straightened and whitened themselves, and his eyes turned sapphire, creating a striking contrast to his dark hair.<br />
<br />
After Chris reached his mid twenties the changes grew much less drastic and, to be honest, Nick was more focused on his growing erection and need to ejaculate, than his friend&#39;s extra wrinkle here and there. Chris was staring at Nick but wasn&#39;t seeing him, as he too was solely focused on his own physical needs. <br />
<br />
From downstairs there was a faint call from a woman&#39;s voice, &quot;Nick honey, I&#39;m home. How&#39;s your homework coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was about to reply but a sudden pleasurable wave radiated from his groin and he groaned instead. The deep rumble of his new voice reminded him that he can&#39;t  say anything because to his mother, he is a strange man in the house. Glancing over, The Chronivac&#39;s display read that the physical changes were at 96%.<br />
<br />
Nick decided to ignore his mom, for all she knew he was in the bathroom. There was suddenly a screech of tires in the driveway, Chris&#39; mom jumped out and stalked up to the door. &quot;Shit, this might get really awkward for a minute here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick realized that he had started masturbating and Chris was laying back on the bed doing the same. There was a knock on the front door and a moment later Nick&#39;s mom was calling for both the boys. <br />
<br />
Nick glanced at the screen as 98 flipped over to 99%. Chris was groaning while he masturbated and Nick realized he had been grunting. As much as he needed to deal with their mother&#39;s downstairs he couldn&#39;t focus on anything but his penis.<br />
<br />
What seemed like an eternity later, the Chronivac beeped that physical changes were 100% and both men came at the same time letting out bestial cries. <br />
<br />
The women who were already on the stairs called out in horror for their children and began running up the stairs bursting through Nick&#39;s bedroom door. <br />
<br />
The post ejaculate stupor was slow to wear off for both the men. Nick&#39;s mom was screaming, demanding to know where her son was and why they were in her son&#39;s room. Chris&#39; mom was the first to realize they had both just gotten off as she immediately screamed &quot;Ahh, They&#39;re perverts&quot; and ran away, probably calling the cops.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s mom, seemed to be firmly under the impression that yelling at the men would bring her son to her. Though Nick and Chris didn&#39;t have a chance to pay her too much attention, the roof of Nick&#39;s room suddenly vaulted up to 25 feet from its usual 8, the toys all began to disappear one by one.  Nick stood up from the computer chair he was sitting at and looked around the room as it changed. <br />
<br />
Though his erection was beginning to go down he was still tenting his shorts which became obvious to his mother when Nick turned to look at everything going on around him. Feeling the whole gambit of emotions but apparently not noticing the reality changes, Nick&#39;s mother did the only thing she could think of, she picked up a toy and threw it at Nick. The toy disappeared as soon as it left her hands, and then she disappeared.<br />
<br />
New clothes shimmered into existence on the men and the Chronivac beeped that it was done.</p>
