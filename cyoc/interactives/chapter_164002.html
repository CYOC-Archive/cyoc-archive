<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clicked on the new family option, a tree showing up with just his portrait sitting at the very bottom. He could see back about three generations, with the option to scroll back further, but every box that should be an ancestor sat blank.<br />
<br />
He clicked on the image that should be his father and a list of options popped up. Randomize, Default, and Generate. Hovering over each gave a list of what each could do. Randomize was pretty much what it said, make a random person to go there. Default would put his actual ancestor there, and Generate would let him feed key words to create a selection he could pick from. All carried the note they could be adjusted after being inserted.<br />
<br />
He clicked on generate, it seemed the safest option to begin with. Randomize seemed too fickle and Default seemed to boring. A window popped up with five slots and a prompt to enter key words. Jeff thought for a moment what kind of father he wanted. Jeff&#39;s father wasn&#39;t the.. most appealing guy on the planet, and he always wondered why his mother married him, though supposedly when they married he was thin and had a full head of hair. Sadly, Jeff got the weight genes without having the skinny younger years. Athletic was definitely the first key word, masculine ended up being the second. He wanted a dad that was.. well.. like a movie dad. Handsome ended up in the third slot. He wondered how the machine would use that, some of these must be subjective, but it seemed to take the word.<br />
<br />
Tapping his lips, Jeff considered.. well hung went into the fourth slot. That sort of thing was genetic if he remembered right. He&#39;d love to have a little more down there, and that would have to help. Tall was the last one to go in. He hit the button to generate. &#39;You have chosed: athletic, masculine, handsome, well-hung, and tall. Accept and generate?&#39; Uhg, stupid programs always asking with multiple confirmations. He selected yes and waited. A box with twenty blank slots appeared, each with a spinning loading wheel. One by one, full body images of men appeared on the screen. Naked men. It was more than Jeff expected, and he looked over to his door to make sure it was shut and locked. He didn&#39;t need his sister coming in and thinking he was looking at porn.<br />
<br />
All the men that appeared had several things in common. All were definitely fit and tall, most had body hair of some sort many had beards, and all had large.. well.. the well-hung took, and even he could tell most were good looking. But there was variety in them too. Athletic seemed to cover a range, muscular body builders to lean swimmers. There was also a spread of ethnicities. From a muscular blond haired, blue eyed guy with a viking beard to a lean Asian man, a muscular middle eastern man with a little bit of a gut, to a tall and fit black man. There was even an option to generate more options. Jeff figured he could always change again later, and focused on one that caught his interest.<br />
<br />
The middle eastern man, or maybe he was Indian, had naturally deep tan skin, his black beard and hair were both neatly groomed and short. A swath of black hair also covered his chest and stomach, more dark hair down his arms and legs. None on his shoulders or back, as Jeff discovered he could rotate the model and zoom in and out. He was heavily muscled, but didn&#39;t sport a set of abs, his stomach was instead had a very minor gut, which just made him look more solid. An aging athlete that couldn&#39;t keep a perfect physique anymore but was still incredibly fit. And of the options, he also seemed to have one of the larger manhoods, darker brown like his nipples, thick and heavy, hanging halfway down his thighs, he also had something Jeff had never seen before, a foreskin.<br />
<br />
When he selected that option that entire side of the tree slowly filled with pictures of men and women, a definite family resemblance running through it. <br />
<br />
He decided to take a different approach on his mother. Default wasn&#39;t what he wanted, but he was curious about the randomize option. He clicked on that and it brought up one window, the image of a nude woman taking up the screen. A slightly curvaceous Hispanic woman. Clicking on randomize again it shifted to a petite Asian woman, then a tall and slender black woman. He kept clicking thinking something would strike his interest and eventually a fiery, curly, red head with pale skin and freckles appeared. She was tall and of average build, a little on the curvy side but not overweight. Part of him wanted to see how those genetics would mix.. he had a feeling his to be father&#39;s would override most of the ones from this woman, but it could be interesting.<br />
<br />
The side of the tree began to fill up as well, lots of red hair and freckles all over the place. It was strange seeing the two trees side by side, but then he noticed over his portrait there was now a button labeled update. A preview maybe? Might as well.. He clicked the button and waited, the spinning doodad appearing over his face.<br />
<br />
He suddenly felt warm, heat creeping along his skin. He looked down to his hands were the skin was suddenly darkening, as if he was watching himself get a tan in super speed, though not as dark as the image of his new father it was definitely darker than he was, a light brown. As the darkening creeped up his arms he tore off his shirt and tossed it aside.<br />
<br />
It was his gut he noticed next, deflating like a punctured balloon. In fact, all the fat on his body seemed to be melting away as his skin tightened up against his frame. The slightly flabby chest he was developing flattened out and he quickly turned to the mirror on his closet door. His face was lean, puffy cheeks and chin retreating, his face was still youthfully round, but not fat. The darker skin poured down his chest and up his neck, his nipples turning a slightly darker shade of brown. When the darker skin reached his hairline, his mousy brown hair started turning black, going from lanky and straight to wavy, then to curly. Hair color was coming from his father, but those curls were from his mother, though his hair started to pull back into his scalp, going from a messy mop to a short crop that you could only barely tell was curly. The color of his eyes swirled, going from brown to hazel, a mix of the brown eyes from one side and green from the other.<br />
<br />
Dark skin moved down his stomach and towards his crotch. He quickly stood up and dropped his shorts, staring as his dick darkened, his pubes going from dark brown to pitch black as it did. There was a tingling in his cock, a foreskin starting to grow back, slipping over the head of his dick. He reached down and slid it back, shuddering at the new feeling. He lifted it and took a look at his scrotum, unchanged other than being much darker. The color of his skin deepened on his legs, travelling down and over his feet.<br />
<br />
The heat moved from his skin and seemed to sink into his bones. His hands and feet suddenly both grew in size, probably gaining at least two shoe sizes in a blink. His limbs started stretching out, getting longer as his shoulders widened. When the fat melted away he had turned rather slender, but now his frame was becoming larger. His chest pushed out as his ribs pushed out, his stance shifting slightly as he felt his hips widen just slightly. But he had just gone from a straight figure to a v-shape, already looking more masculine than he did. He felt his spine stretching adding a couple more inches on what his legs did. He had to step back to see himself completely in the mirror now, guessing he had gone over six feet in his growth spurt.<br />
<br />
The heat moved up into his skull, his face contorting strangely, like watching a morphing video online. His cheekbones pushed out as his jaw and chin became more pronounced. His face going from a round shape to more square. His brows became more prominent as his nose broadened and sharpened.<br />
<br />
The heat shifted again, now feeling like it was coursing through his veins. Muscles began to bulge out all over his body. First his chest inflated. He sat down heavily on his bed, his hand running over the inflating muscle. It felt so.. strong and firm. His flexing arm shifted as muscles his biceps and triceps swelled with new growth, even his forearms gaining more mass, his shoulders rounding. His new father might have a slight gut, but he had the advantage of youth, and his flat stomach suddenly developed the ridges and grooves of a lean six-pack. His ass swelled slightly as his dick suddenly began to grow. He had gotten worried that the one change was it, but now it was lengthening and growing thicker. Even as his thighs grew muscle on either side, his third leg seemed to have the most impressive growth spurt. His new tool flopped heavily against his thigh, and he had to spread his legs a bit to accommodate for the two chicken egg sized balls he had hanging between them. His calves bulked up as the muscle growth passed down his legs. He had good bulk for a teenager, looking like he played football or some other sport that required strength. He couldn&#39;t hold a candle to the bulk of his father, but that would probably change as he got older. He wasn&#39;t done growing yet, he knew that much.<br />
<br />
As if coming full circle, the heat moved back to his skin, though focused in certain spots. Black hair grew in thicker on his legs and forearms, the slight bushes under his arms suddenly became thick forests of black hair. Black hair started growing up the middle of his stomach from his pubes, reaching his belly button then a few inches past it. A diamond patch of dark hair grew in on his chest, and more peeked out around his nipples. A faint shadow but promising a pelt of dark hair as he got older. The heat moved back into his face and he looked to the mirror. His brows thickened noticeably as what had been non-existent facial hair began to grow in. Darkening sideburns growing in front of his ears, a slight shadow growing in on his upper lip and chin, then just along the base of his jaw,  barely meeting his sideburns. He rubbed at his face. He could grow a whole beard now, it would be a thin thing, but it would probably get thicker as well as he got older. He could only think of a few guys in his class with anywhere near this amount of facial and body hair.<br />
<br />
The heat seemed to subside, and he realized he was looking at an entirely different person in the mirror. There was no trace of the old Jeff to be found. He stood up and did some flexing poses he saw somewhere, admiring his new body. His cock even began to chub up from his excitement. New memories began to flood his mind. A father that played sports with him, taught him how to work out and build muscle. A history of playing sports in high school, surprisingly with good academics. A whole different family, him and a brother instead of a sister. Half-Indian and half-Irish, though the Indian blood definitely came through stronger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock on the door, a deep voice calling out, &quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t recognize the voice at first, then he did. It was his father. &quot;Uh.. one sec.&quot; Woah! Was that his voice? It was definitely deeper, but he had no time to think on it. He quickly looked about as saw where he discarded his shorts, he grabbed them and pulled them on. Surprisingly they fit. He hadn&#39;t even noticed his room had shifted slightly, some workout equipment and trophies appearing, dirty dishes and snacks vanishing. &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad.. his new dad opened the door and peeked his head inside, a smile breaking through that dark black beard. &quot;Your mother says dinner will be ready in fifteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff ran a hand through his hair, calming his breathing. &quot;Right, I&#39;ll be down, just gotta put a shirt on.&quot;<br />
<br />
His father nodded and shut the door. Jeff sat down on his bed with a sigh, looking over at the computer. The Chronivac had updated his picture, a little system message of &#39;Update Complete&#39; flashing on the screen.</p>
