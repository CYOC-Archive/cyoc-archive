<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Snow White stared in shock at the horsey Cinderella who was breathing deeply, her wide nostrils flaring. Kylie <br />
conjured up a bright red apple and offered it to her. Cinderella sniffed cautiously, then clopped forward and <br />
bent her head. The thought of using her hands to pick up the fruit never entered her mind as she crunched the <br />
juicy apple with her larger teeth, manipulating the chunks with her leathery lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's terrible!&quot; the dark-haired Snow White exclaimed in her tiny voice. Cinderella's ears pricked up at the <br />
sound, swiveling toward her as she continued to munch her treat.<br />
<br />
Kylie turned to her with a cruel smirk. &quot;Do I hear our next volunteer?&quot; she asked. &quot;How fitting, considering <br />
the apple and all. You just can't resist them, can you?&quot; Cinderella finished the fruit, wickering softly. <br />
Kylie wiped her hand on Cindy's gown and turned to properly face the princesses. &quot;Hm, perhaps I should stick <br />
with the classics for you,&quot; she mused. She snapped her fingers once, twice, three times.<br />
<br />
There was a slight flash and in front of Snow White there appeared a pedestal with three brightly colored <br />
apples sitting on it. The were perfectly round, juicy and ripe. First was rosy red and shining, second a <br />
yellow apple that was almost gold, and third a bright green one the same shade as grass. The smell of them was <br />
powerful and Snow found herself breathing in the rich scent of apples in spite of herself. Her mouth watered. <br />
They looked so good..<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do it!&quot; hissed Jasmine. &quot;You just heard her say these would transform you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Snow White nodded weakly but couldn't take her eyes away from the lovely beauties in front of her. Just a <br />
taste, she thought. What could one little bit hurt? The absurdity of the thought didn't occur to the princess <br />
who had fallen into a poisoned sleep thanks to one bite of an apple offered by a witch. Snow's fingers <br />
twitched at her side. She reached out shakily, licking her lips, and picked up the first one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can it hurt?&quot; she said out loud. Her stomach rumbled and she had to keep swallowing to keep from <br />
drooling. &quot;I am rather hungry, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her perfect red lips matched the color of the apple's flesh as she took her first bite. The taste exploded on <br />
her tongue. It was tart and sweet, crisp and fresh. It tasted like apple pie, apple sauce, of autumn and <br />
spices and cold apple juice. She cooed in delight and took another, bigger bite, chewing noisily. Bite after <br />
bite, Snow White munched on the apple, licking her lips to get every bit of juice she could.<br />
<br />
As she crunched the apple, enthralled by its flavor, soft brown fur began to sprout on the back of her hands. <br />
It slowly rippled up her arms with each bite and the other princesses could see her fingernails turning darker <br />
and darker until they were black. The fur crept up her slender neck and across the top of her cleavage, no <br />
doubt travelling downward across her breasts, stomach and legs as well. Snow White took the final bite of the <br />
first apple and there was a small ripping sound as a tear-drop shaped tail popped out of the fabric over her <br />
behind. It was brown on top and white underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;So good,&quot; she said, her voice sounding a bit deeper than it had moments ago. With only the slightest pause, <br />
she picked up the second apple and bit into it. This time the flavor was sharper, a bit more sour and earthy <br />
somehow. She tasted a bit of dirt and grass, as though it had been dropped on the ground, but strangely didn't <br />
mind. If anything, it made the apple taste even better.<br />
<br />
While munching on her second apple, Snow White's ears became pointed. They quickly acquired the same grey fur <br />
that was creeping up to cover her face, the color darkening to black near the tips. Inside her lengthening <br />
ears, white fur sprouted and when it was finished her ears had become elongated and stuck out mostly sideways <br />
from her head. Next her nose began to darken and flattened as it did so. The dark color trailed down to her <br />
upper lip and Snow White snorted softly in delight as she kept chewing and slurping up her treat. Her nose and <br />
mouth fused slightly as her nose flattened further and her face pushed out to give her a small muzzle. Snow <br />
White snorted again, a large tongue flicking out to lick her upper lip.<br />
<br />
She only needed one hand to hold the apple so her other one was free to wander. Her royal underwear began to <br />
feel constrictive and tight, so she brought her hand down to press against the area in a most unlady-like <br />
gesture. The touch of her hand sent a shiver of delight through her body and Snow White began to rub her <br />
bulging mound through the fabric of her dress and panties. A deep moan snuck out of her throat between bites.<br />
<br />
The last bite of the apple brought changes mostly unseen as her legs slimmed and her feet slipped from her <br />
shoes. With a muffled crack, her knees reversed direction. Snow White's tail wiggled and her ears swiveled at <br />
the sound but she continued chewing. Her toes lengthened, the nails turning black and fusing together into <br />
small hooves that made clicking sounds as she shifted her weight.<br />
<br />
Snow White tossed away the second apple core and eyed the other. She snorted softly, the scent intoxicating, <br />
and quickly snatched it up. &quot;One more couldn't hurt,&quot; she said in a deep voice. She crunched into the last <br />
fruit. This one only had a hint of apple flavor, mostly tasting of fresh green leaves and summer grass. It was <br />
absolutely delicious and Snow White dug into it with greater fervor.<br />
<br />
As she took bigger bites, her changes continued. Her breasts began to shrink away, leaving the front of her <br />
dress rather empty. Her free hand stroked the front of her dress more firmly and a slight wet spot was just <br />
starting to become visible. In her panties, her clit had grown and swelled out into a small, thick cock-like <br />
shape. Behind it, Snow's pussy was quickly fusing shut, her pubic hair lightening to brown and spreading out <br />
to make a sheath. With a tug, two large egg-sized testicles dropped and her cock popped free of the waistband, <br />
snaking up her stomach. Snow White moaned deeply in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Her breasts smoothed out into a flat chest, but the space left behind wasn't empty for long. Instead her chest <br />
started to expand and fill out, gaining bulk and muscle. The fur there thickened and turned white, the shaggy <br />
ruff spilling out the front. Snow White swallowed the last few bites in one go, chewing only a couple times <br />
before it disappeared down her throat. Her form swelled with muscle and her strong hand grasped her hard <br />
length through the dress. It took only one firm stroke for her to explode with hot cum, a manly bellow <br />
sounding from her throat. From her temple, white horns began to sprout, rapidly climbing upward past her dark <br />
hair and tiara. They branched as they grew until Snow White had a stately pair of antlers.<br />
<br />
Snow White scented the air, smelling the females nearby. None of them were quite his taste but the one with <br />
white fur smelled as if she would be going into heat soon. Clomping on his larger hooves, he moved to join <br />
Cinderella.<br />
<br />
Kylie eyed the other princesses. Most of them wore looks of shock or disgust, but one had a different <br />
expression. The witch decided that she would be next.</p>
