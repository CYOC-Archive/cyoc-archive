<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You let Brenda enjoy a nice nap while you play around with pulling and stretching the PVC suit that Brenda is wearing. She begins to stir after a while, her cock still hard thanks to your gentle massage of her lupine shaft.<br />
<br />
Brenda keeps her head resting on your breasts, and softly says, &quot;I want to feed the plant again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You groan softly, &quot;I don't think that is a good idea, but if you want to, go ahead.&quot; It is times like this that being submissive is not a good trait.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Brenda pulls her cock from your vagina, and slides her body down a little lower so she can slide most of her shaft into your anus. After twisting her hips to position her cock tip at your tight anus, she gives a strong, steady thrust with her hips, sliding in until she bumps her cock head into the base of the plant. Brenda lies still and relaxes.<br />
<br />
Brenda says nothing, and you can feel movement in your ass, but it's not from Brenda. This continues for several minutes, and then Brenda begins to thrust her hips back and forth while raising her upper body off yours, holding her self up on her arms to get more leverage in her thrusting. She is ramming her cock in as hard as she can, you feel her scrotum slap against your latex thighs. You watch her face, as she stares, a slight drool sliding down one side of her mouth. Suddenly she starts to grunt repeatedly, you can feel her orgasm just hit as she is now pumping her cum into your ass. You feel something change as her thrusts feel different, like her cock is getting bigger, but then you feel the plant move with each of her thrusts. Then you notice it's not her cock getting bigger, it's the roots attaching itself to Brenda's cock. Brenda's flow from her cock slows to a trickle while she quickly recharges. Then Brenda looks down into your eyes, her loving eyes gone, replaced with a dark, piercing look. &quot;Release me&quot; says Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can pull out anytime dear&quot; you say<br />
<br />
&quot;Release me&quot; says Brenda again. She sits upright and tries to slide back off the sofa. Both you and Brenda tumble off the couch and onto the floor, her cock locked inside your ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Release me&quot; calls out Brenda again. You feel the plant move slightly closer to your anus.<br />
<br />
Realizing this probably is not Brenda, you say, &quot;No. If you are the plant, you will stay in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda only says, &quot;Release me&quot;<br />
<br />
You first clench your ass tight, and squeeze the inside of your bowels tightly, &quot;If you do not let go, I will cause you pain&quot; you warn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Release me&quot; is your only reply from Brenda.<br />
<br />
You alter the lining of your bowels to secret stomach acid where it touches the plant.<br />
<br />
Brenda screams out in pain, and you pull yourself away from Brenda, her cock sliding out, but still attached by a few of the roots. You restore your bowels and neutralize the acid by adjusting the pH of your normal anal lubricant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I would cause you pain.&quot; you say. You turn around and sit facing Brenda. You keep your ass squeezed tight, to keep the plant where it is.<br />
<br />
Brenda looks down and strokes the roots attached to her cock tip as if they are delicate to handle. You reach out and pull one of the roots off Brenda's cock, and she screams in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not in control here. If you attempt to harm anyone, I will end this now. Tell me what you are.&quot; you declare in a stern voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a breeder. I create seeds with hybrid life codes.&quot; responds Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not of this world?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; is the response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you. We can work together.&quot; you suggest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your form is different. I cannot bond with you. It is efficient if we bond&quot; states Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot allow us to bond, but there may be an alternative. You have altered my body some already. I may be able to absorb more of your life code&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I must bond with this life form&quot; says Brenda as she comes closer to you.<br />
<br />
You push Brenda back, &quot;No. I will not allow it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda pushes your arms away and tries to reenter your anus, but you use your legs to keep her away. She cannot fight both your arms and legs. After a few minutes of struggling on the floor, Brenda stops and looks at you, &quot;I will destroy this consciousness if you do not permit me to bond.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly you rip the roots that remain attached to Brenda's cock, and she erupts in a long agonizing scream. You keep pulling on the roots, keeping the plant still, until you feel these roots detach from the bulb and slide out of your anus. You make your way to the sink and turn on the water. Then you imagine your hands secreting a strong acid, and slowly dissolve the roots in your hands. You then restore your hands to normal, wash them off, and rejoin Brenda after turning off the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brenda, dear, are you alright?&quot; you ask, very concerned.<br />
<br />
Brenda takes a deep breath, &quot;That plant is evil&quot; she says softly. &quot;It was in my mind. It made me do things, I remember everything.&quot; Brenda lowers her head into her hands, as she begins to cry.<br />
<br />
You sit down next to her, and hold her tightly against you. &quot;Dear, I need to know what you saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda tries to collect herself, and in a still sobbing voice, &quot;Terrible, evil things. It controls things, people, plants, animals. Its seeds are its way to get control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many of these things are there?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Brenda sobs for a few moments before responding, &quot;I saw images in my mind of a lab that only had this one plant. They aren't alien, they are a runaway genetics experiment. It was lying to you because it read my mind, it knew you were aroused by it and it wanted to use you. The scientists who created it tried to destroy the plant, but it got them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think for a moment and say &quot;Now I know I am immune to its controls, and that you are not&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The plant is afraid of you. It can't bond with you like it did me. Please kill it. I saw what it wanted to do with me. I know it has altered my body already.&quot; Brenda says as she works to keep her composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I knew this was too good to be true. I bet if it tasted horrible, it would want me to help it save the world.&quot; you say as you take a few moments to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do the seeds work?&quot; you ask Brenda.<br />
<br />
Brenda explains &quot;The seeds grow smaller version of the bulb where it can get foot. Mostly it embeds itself in the rectum, or in the womb of an animal. The nerve bundle attaches to the host, and makes the host highly suggestible.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How did the plant end up in the womb of that woman in the store?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Brenda searches though the plant's memories in her mind, and begins &quot;The woman had a seed implanted when she fell in a hole hiking in the forest and some of her clothing tore. When she came to, her husband was pulling her out of the hole. While he was tending to her injuries, the seed bonded in her rectum. She saw the plant, and was compelled to take it with her back to her home. Once there, the plant resumed it's penis form, and used strong pheromones to lure her husband to slide the plant into his ass, where his seed was deposited and his body altered to better suit the plant. Then her husband helped the plant into his wife's womb. The bulb was much smaller then, looking like a normal flower with a very desirable odor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I have the plant's conscious mind inside me. If I kill it now, that is the end of it. That is good to know.&quot;, and you lean forward and kiss Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, I want that thing dead&quot; demands Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will dispose of it dear soon enough. What was it like, being connected to it?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was strange. I could feel you squeeze me and the acid burning my body, it was like me and the plant were one and the same.&quot; Brenda says in a somber voice.<br />
<br />
You look at Brenda &quot;I am going to sleep on the couch tonight. You can have the bed. I want to make sure the plant is destroyed before we get too close again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda gets up and walks toward the bedroom, &quot;Thank you dear. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile happily at Brenda and say &quot;I love you too my dear.&quot; and you watch as she turns and heads into the bedroom. You stay on the floor, and imagine a small cock head growing from the lining of your bowels where the plant stretches you the most. Soon you feel the prickly hairs of the roots begin to attach themselves. Your excitement level is tremendous as your heart pounds rapidly in anticipation.</p>
