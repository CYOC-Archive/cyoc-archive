<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The always busy coffee shop had fewer customers than usual. Jennifer took a sip of her usual coffee that she normally ordered. Somehow it tasted blander than usual. Was it because of the different barista or because of the quality of the coffee that made it taste bland? The clerk at the counter looked tired and busy and seemed to make a lot of mistakes, but they tried their best to serve the coffee as best as they could. Then Jennifer looked at her mother and told Annabel that she had already promised to have a Taco Tuesday with her father.<br />
<br />
“Mom. I really would love to spend more time with you, and I thank you for sitting down with me. But you know, Dad wouldn’t like it if he suddenly saw me with you,” Jennifer clarified her reasoning for not accepting her mother’s offer for her mom.<br />
<br />
Annabel looked disappointed and switched the topic to something else. More minutes passed as the two talked to each other until it was Annabel’s time to go. Jennifer’s mother approached her daughter and tightly hugged Jennifer with her two basketball-sized breasts. “I hope you have a good Taco Tuesday with your father. You can call me whenever you feel like it. The offer’s always there. Stay safe, sweetie, and have fun with your father. Bye-bye.”<br />
<br />
This was the cue for Jennifer to do what she thought was the right thing to do and immediately head straight to the school. Jennifer usually took the backmost seat in her classes, and all the teachers were blind as bats. She finished her iced coffee and ran to her next class. Then for the rest of her day, she attended every class after that and made a bold move to gaslight her math teacher to believe that she was in their class. Jennifer told the most convincing and convoluted lie to her teacher about, how they’ve simply missed Jennifer during their morning check-up and how she attended her teacher’s math class. Jennifer saw on her teacher’s face how they questioned themselves.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Jennifer. I mark down that you attended my class.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer left the school grounds with an ear-reaching smile on her face. When she arrived back home, Jennifer picked up the scent of minced meat and fresh vegetables. Her father was preparing the tacos in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back, I hope you had a wonderful school day,” Otto greeted his daughter.<br />
<br />
“Hi, Dad. The day was pretty... I would say meh, but the day isn’t over yet. We haven’t eaten our tacos, so the feeling for the day could go from meh to decent.” Jennifer came running to hug her dad after she placed the backpack on the sofa. “Oh, by the way, I found your wallet in my backpack. Any idea how it ended up in my backpack?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm. I didn’t even realize that my wallet was missing, as I was at home all day. Thanks, pumpkin, for letting me know that you had it with you.” Otto patted Jennifer’s hair in approval. “But let me think… How did my wallet get into your backpack…? Oh yeah, I think it was because of yesterday’s mall day. We went to that shoe store to buy you those black heels and fishnet top you begged me to buy for you. My hands were full at the moment with all your other shopping bags. So I asked you to take my wallet from my back pocket and use it for me, I guess you placed my wallet to your backpack when we left the mall.” Otto said his thoughts out loud. “I assumed you returned the card into my pants back pocket. But you are such a good and honest girl, Jennifer. I promise you that once we’re done eating, we go to the mall. We could even go to that tattoo parlor you’ve always wanted to visit to get your first ear piercings.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s heart rate spiked. She felt more than happy when her dad called her a good girl. She looked at her dad and did the unthinkable. She gave a quick peck to her father’s lips. Jennifer’s heartbeat got even faster when she saw her dad’s flabbergasted face staring at her. Otto was awestruck by his daughter’s sudden inappropriate action, but what surprised Jennifer even more was how he reacted. <br />
<br />
Her dad didn’t shout at her or correct her weird behavior. Jennifer felt as if her dad secretly liked it. Her heart beat even faster. She wondered if it was possible that her dad had a crush on her all this time. Jennifer had to confirm something. She remembered her mother’s words about how she was a big pervert, or something in that manner. She couldn’t have possibly referred to this. There was no way that she had feelings for her own father. Jennifer didn’t want to believe what she was seeing and hearing and asked from her dad. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Dad, what would you say if I told you that your daughter’s a nasty pervert and that she wants to rub and suck her dad’s breadstick on this sofa before the dinner is ready? Could you imagine saying no to such an idea?”</p>
