<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A pair of good-looking twins clad in the same white thong arrived. They were conversing but Chad noted that they were keeping their voices low on purpose. William picked up on that too and turned towards Chad with a suspicious look. Chad just shrugged his shoulders, more focused on trying to eavesdrop whatever he could as they neared the center table.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Have enough already...&quot;  said the one on the left carrying towels.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Renovated... basement leak...&quot; the other who was wheeling the cart as he ribbed the other with his elbow.<br />
<br />
They got quiet and resumed looking like actual spa attendants rather than bickering bros when they finally slid the cart to a stop on Chad&#39;s side. Chad gulped and couldn&#39;t help but reach his hand out to William&#39;s. William noticed, gave Chad a wink and flipped his hand over to grip it tenderly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dudes, I&#39;m Paul this here&#39;s my brother Cas.&quot; said the one on Chad&#39;s side with unexpected casualness. Over on William&#39;s, Cas gave a curt nod and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Paul started preparing the cart and let the steam out of the exposed lid. Strong smells of the ocean and something oddly sweet, grapes?- filled the air . <br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are in for a great time, this seaweed is special. We got it all the way from the Aegean sea and it&#39;s got like all kinds of good benefits and...,&quot; Paul giggled but Cas glared &quot;... a little something extra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s algae.&quot; Cas cut in immediately and towel-snapped his brother. Chad and William just laid there not knowing to be amused or worried.<br />
<br />
Paul rubbed his sore spot and told the boys to lie down and relax and they complied. His charming and charismatic grin certainly helped lighten any tenseness in the room. <br />
<br />
Now both of the attendants grabbed the green, oozing clump of tangled mass to start the wrapping process. Chad saw some glittery reflections but thought it was just the spa being extra with their presentation or something. Then out of nowhere Paul yelped. &quot;Wait there&#39;s 2 of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
William jolted right up but Cas pushed him back down and held him tightly while Chad looked nervously at the startled attendant. &quot;Shit, we only have enough for one person. Wasn&#39;t it just one coupon that was sent out?&quot; he muttered aloud<br />
<br />
Cas growled at him to zip it. &quot;Someone higher up probably changed it at the last second.&quot;His muscles flexed to restrain the football player but William couldn&#39;t seem to wrestle free, it was as if this guy had superhuman strength or something. &quot;I got an idea, flip the skinny one over to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul quickly did as he was told and with slimy hands, grabbed Chad&#39;s arms and twisted his body to face William as the attendant kept him pinned down; if he had his older body maybe he could break free but not with his twinky bod. On the other side of the table the same process happened and now both boys were squished together face to face, body pressed against body; cocks to cocks as their towels flew off in the tumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, get your hands off me.&quot; William craned his neck back, partly to avoid almost locking lips with Chad and partly to look at his captor. Chad noticed his face was red and honestly so was his own. He was in such close contact with this well-muscled jock that his dick swelled. He felt William&#39;s harden in response too as they rubbed together due to his struggles.<br />
<br />
The attendants ignored their protests continued to press the two boys securely together. Paul left the task of holding Chad to Cas and much to their surprise, he single-handedly pinned both him and the bigger football player together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get their legs first, or else they&#39;re gonna give you a black eye with their heels.&quot; Cas ordered while lifting up one leg to block Chad and William&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
Chad felt something warm and slimy invade his footsie-playing feet and William&#39;s. He tried to look down but their pressed bodies are blocking his sight of their legs. His feet were securely bound together with Williams and he could only try to wriggle them around. Soon the hot seaweed reach up to their knees and thighs and stung their skin causing Chad to grind into William in reflex.<br />
<br />
Cas and Paul took advantage of Chad&#39;s sensitive skin and quickly wrapped their butts and crotches tightly together. Now it was easier to handle the boys and the rest of the wrapping process went smoothly. William winced as he felt his dick pressed against Chad&#39;s belly and vice versa. He wanted to get closer to Chad but even this was a little ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Their pecs pressed together, William&#39;s larger than Chad but it didn&#39;t stop them from rubbing more. Now their arms were bound to their sides and bodies together; they could only squirm like sweaty worms as the inside of the warm and humid wrap felt like a sauna, increasing their arousal. <br />
<br />
As the attendants wrapped the last strips of seaweed they realized they were just only at the boys neck. &quot;Uh... I think we&#39;re out.&quot; Paul dug around in the cart and pulled out nothing but air. &quot;W-what are we gonna do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, they can make out while they soak in their damp cocoon. Keeps them distracted while their transformation into mermen goes well underway&quot; Cas wiped his hands on a towel nonchalantly, much to everyone&#39;s collective surprise.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s voice quivered &quot;D-dude, I thought we weren&#39;t supposed to tell them!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!&quot; William yelled.<br />
<br />
Cas smirked and looked down at the bound wriggling sack of wet seaweed with Chad and William&#39;s head sticking out. &quot;What are they gonna do? Walk out of the spa?&quot; He tossed the towel onto his shoulders and cleaned up the station. &quot;We don&#39;t need anymore attendants running around here but the new bathhouse could use some help.&quot; he spoke and grabbed the cart, ready to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, is this safe?&quot; Chad asked meekly. His face was still red and it wasn&#39;t just because of the warm insides of their wrap. Even now he could feel his cock grinding on William&#39;s and the hot, slimy strands covering all over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Never done it before. Never had a bathhouse before.&quot; Paul mused matter-of-factly. &quot;It&#39;ll probably be fine. It&#39;s supposed to turn your legs into a fish tail over an hour or two... but, the directions say one person per use so maybe...&quot; Paul just shrugged and did some kind of mime by interlocking his fingers... whatever that&#39;s supposed to mean.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two boys just relax and enjoy the spa. Soak in all that good fresh seaweed, it&#39;ll do wonders for your fins.&quot; Cas said slyly and he and Paul both left the room.<br />
<br />
Peace and quiet at last, in the marbled room. Not that Chad and William could do much as they wriggled and humped their bodies together. Chad&#39;s eyes looked up to the larger male, who was doing most of the struggling; William&#39;s eyes locked on and his already flushed face got even redder. Chad didn&#39;t say it but he actually didn&#39;t really mind what was happening to them. The problem of no longer being able to walk did surface but he could think about that later. William was distracting him way too much at the moment as he felt a little bit of pre escape his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think i can tear it...&quot; William cooed naively and Chad nodded. He followed William&#39;s rhythm but he wasn&#39;t really thinking about escaping and he wondered if William was doing the same thing too. He looked really hot from this angle.<br />
<br />
Chad felt his chest being compressed as William flexed his entire body, cramming his already tight spot further. He accidentally let out a lewd moan, enough to break William&#39;s concentration. &quot;Sorry...&quot; Chad muttered as he looked up with big puppy dog eyes. The next thing he knew William jammed his lips against his own. He felt the tongue of the jock push through and he responded by furiously tasting his new invader. Both of the boys now subjects of their own desires and lust, let the heat of the moment and whatever spell had possessed them to pull them deeper as a warm tingling sensation crept up their lower bodies. Could the seaweed wrap be starting to take effect?<br />
<br />
William pulled his panting mouth back and looked into Chad&#39;s eyes. &quot;Damn, I always wanted to do that.&quot;</p>
