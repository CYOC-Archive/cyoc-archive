<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boy smirked as he ran from the magic shop. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d get away with his plan so easily. But now, he had enough items to enact his revenge, and only one semester left of high school to do so. He began Revenge Phase One: Ruining rthe Football Tean.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s name was Riley, and he had never been good around the football team. He found out he was gay freshman year and was riddiculed for it. But then, ove the summer between sophomore and junior year, the star varsity runningback Hunter asked him out. Riley agreed and the two began a secretive relationship. They dated for a year and a half until the big playoff game. Hunter ran in the winning touchdown, launching he and his team into the state championship. Riley went to congragulate him, but when he got to him, some of his friends were there. Egged on by the others, Hunter shoved Riley to the ground, calling him a fag. Well, now it was time to get even.<br />
<br />
Riley put on a protective magical jelly on his lips, and then applied a lip balm the should have made the wearer grow a beard. He then texted Hunter to meet him in the closet by the bathrooms.<br />
<br />
When Riley entered the closet, Hunter was already there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Riley! Honey I&#39;m so sorry you know how those guys get. If they new I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to play in the state championship, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley cut him off a planted a kiss on his lips. They began to passionately make out. Unknown to Hunter, the lip balm was doing its job, as hairs began to push out of his face. The scruff filled in to form a beard. When it was full enough, Riley stopped kissing and wiped his lips with a tissue. Hunter only the realized he predicament as Riley got out his wand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what the fuck?! I have a beard!?! Riley what-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arasu de obi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter immediatly moaned from the intense pleasure enacted upon him. Riley leaned forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot come until I allow you to.&quot; Riley smiled menacingly. &quot;You may talk, but all you are allowed to do is beg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Riley.&quot; Hunter whimpered. &quot;Please stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley enjoyed hearing his ex squirm and plead for his release. He went over to his bag and searched through it. He retrieved the dog whistle that turned all who hear into dogs, a pair of sound blocking ear muffs, a potion of anthropomorphism, a potion of gay love, and a shampoo that arouses the user. He poured a bit of the gay and antro potions into the shampoo. He mixed it thoroughly. Thrn he turned back to Hunter, who was furiously trying to jack off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Hunter. Here&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do. You will be the vessel of my revenge. Your beard will control you through my power of my wand. You will be able to say anything, but every time you mention me you will get hairier and hairier until you are a completely obedient ape. Got it?&quot; Riley pointed the wand at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I be able to cum?&quot; Hunter protested. Riley sighed, then smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Riley said. &quot;You will cum once you complete a task. However, the minute another task is ready, you will become highly aroused. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just let me cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright don&#39;t sound so eager.&quot; Riley smiled. &quot;For your first task, you will bring this shampoo into the locker room. You will replace the conmunity shampoo with this. Once you are sure everyone has applied the shampoo, you will put on these ear muffs and blow the dog whistle. Then you will come here when you are able to cum. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter concealed his pounding erection in his shorts. He grabbed the items and headed to the showers. He walked towards the community shampoo, the feeling of his beard foreign on his face. He didn&#39;t know how, but it almost seemed to guide him. That and the pounding erection he had. He swapped the shampoo and hid the old one in his locker. The team then began to come in.<br />
<br />
Routine and instruction from their coach required everyone lather up so as to not smell during the school day. All the team member rushed to the shower to finish before school let out. They all emptied the contents of the shampoo into their hands and began to apply.<br />
<br />
Hunter&#39;s beard swelled, as if to say &quot;blow the whistle.&quot; He was about to when his friend Drew came up to him, soaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey stud.&quot; He said, the gay of the shampoo not only arousing him but drawing him towards Hunter. &quot;When&#39;d you grow such sexy facial hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter gasped, still unable to cum. &quot;Uh... that fag Riley made me-&quot; he was cut off by and odd feeling. The hair on his beard spread, covering his neck completely. He paniced, put on the ear muffs, and blew the whistle.<br />
<br />
All of the football players began to moan. Layers of fur pushed out of their skin. The moans turned into howls as they turned into gay, horny, anthro dogs. A massive orgy began, cocks becoming canine, faces becoming muzzles. Hunter couldn&#39;t stand to watch his friends reduced to such a state. He ran out of the locker room, escaping the humping and howling, and got into the closet. Riley smiled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, Hunter. You may cum now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter immediatly creamed his pants. The release was fulfilling. Through his pants, he looked up at Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?!&quot; Hunter gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it seemed you told someone about me, and now you have a beard running down your neck. I suppose that&#39;s a warning I ain&#39;t fucking around. But I turned your entire varsity football team in to a bunch of gay, horny dogs. It&#39;s part one of my revenge plan. And now, it&#39;s time for part 2. Come on, I have another task for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter suddenly became painfully erect again as the second task began</p>
