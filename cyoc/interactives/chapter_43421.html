<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Masami jumped at the sound of knocking on the stall door.
<P>"It's me," said an unfamiliar girl's voice. How's it going in there?"
<P>Masami sighed, resigning herself to the inevitable. She slowly opened the door, hoped Greg had ended up with an equally embarrassing look.
<P>In front of her stood a beautiful blond-haired woman in a skimpy shirt, super short denim shorts and a baseball cap. She was a half foot taller, which weirded Masami out, as she was unaccustomed to being so short.
<P>"Wow! And I thought I looked sexy. You take the freaking cake!"
<P>Masami was too shocked to move.
<P>"Come on, don't you want to hug me or something? We're girls now. PDA is more acceptable."
<P>"G...Greg?" Masami stammered. She had adopted a tense pose with her knees pointing at each other and her arms making an X across her chest to hide her cleavage.
<P>"Oh, you sound so cute," Greg said. She leaned into the changing room and hugged Masami gently. This pressed Masami's arms against her own breasts quite hard, causing her face to turn red from the unfamiliar sensation.
<P>"Greg, please get off me!" she begged nervously. "I'm still getting used to this."
<P>Greg released her hold and looked at her strangely. "Uh...Ollie?"
<P>"What?" Masami answered.
<P>Greg backed up a couple steps. "I didn't know you could speak Japanese."
<P>"I can't," Masami said, confused. Suddenly, upon thinking about it, she realized that she not only had a fluent knowledge of the language, but that she'd been using it without even realizing it.
<P>"It's part of the mental package that was chosen," Alice said, walking over to them. "Both your transformations were random, but her transformation had the stronger of the two mental packages."
<P>"But I was the one who wanted the extra mental alterations," Greg said. "Ollie was more worried about that stuff."
<P>"Oh my goodness," Alice said, losing her pleasant attitude. "I'm so sorry. I must have mixed up your rooms."
<P>"You switched rooms?" Masami said in disbelief. This time, with concentration, it came out as thickly accented English.
<P>"You mean I could have been the sexy Japanese girl?" Greg whined. "Man, I never thought I'd be so disappointed to turn into a preppy sports chick."
<P>Masami took a closer look at Greg's new body. Her skin was nicely tanned, and her build was trim with healthy musculature. Strangely enough, her hair was actually shorter than before. She now wore it in a short crop underneath her cap. On her feet were white athletic socks and white cross-trainers.
<P>"I'd be more than happy to give you a matching look," Alice said. "But you'd have to wait an hour. It's just a precaution, but there are certain complications that could arise if you were changed again right now."
<P>Masami felt confused. On one hand, she was embarrassed that her friend found her body so appealing. On the other, she felt proud, and even a little giddy. She had to fight to suppress the desire to pose provocatively for Greg, showing off the body she could have had.
<P>"Never mind," Greg said to Alice's offer. "I'm okay like this. Ollie should have the hot Asian chick thing all to him...er...HERself."
<P>"But I don't want stay like geisha," Masami said. It felt weird to be speaking her native language like she had learned it from a textbook.
<P>Greg was trying very hard not to smirk. "You sound so adorable. Sexy, even."
<P>Hearing that from the girl his friend had become made Masami's horniness more prominent. It threatened to emerge from the back of her mind and overrun her rational thoughts.
<P>"I'm not liking these feelings." She rubbed her shoulders, arms still crossed at her chest. "Feel...very weird."
<P>"You should be feeling even better than me," Greg said. "You got the better package. Those girl thoughts to much to handle?"
<P>"Yes," Masami said meekly.
<P>Greg put her hand on Masami's shoulder. Masami's heart skipped a beat. "You'll be fine," Greg said. "Just take a few minutes to get used to it. I feel a bit more like a girl myself, though I guess my attitude hasn't changed as much as I thought it did. I probably just convinced myself I was thinking like a girl, and that was enough."
<P>"You not helping," Masami said.
<P>Greg laughed. "Sorry, but it's just so fantastic! Don't you feel all energetic and sexy?"
<P>She was definitely feeling sexy, though she was shamed to admit it. When she had agreed to it, she never thought her femininity would be so prominently on display. "This supposed to be experiencing life as women, not sexy women."
<P>"You shouldn't have gone with a random look, then," Greg said. "Maybe sixteenth-century super conservative dresses are more your thing. We can get you one of those when we come back."
<P>"I not go anywhere!" Masami protested.
<P>"You want to wait here for an hour? We'd be even more bored than we were before. Come on, we're getting some dinner. Maybe find a dance club or something. I need to move."
<P>Greg began to walk toward the entrance. Masami hurried to keep up, but her slightly shorter gait, flowing clothes, and less athletic body made it difficult. "Slow down!" she called. "Sandals make difficult!"
<P>"Sorry," Greg said. She decreased her speed, but only slightly. "I've gotta concentrate to control myself. Guess these legs were made for power walking."
<P>Masami tried her best to stay side-by-side with Greg as they walked around the island in the warm afternoon. Her efforts to keep pace with Greg, and Greg's efforts to walk normally, prevented the pair from noticing the stares of male vacationers they passed by.
<P>"That place we passed near the docks this morning looked like it had good grub," Greg said. "Or would you prefer sushi?"
<P>Masami simply pouted in response.
<P>"Oh hey," Greg said. "Did you get a girl name?"
<P>"Masami," Masami said with a resentful huff that was meant to protest both Greg's quick pace and her predicament.
<P>"Mine's Gwen. Hope we can get used to these. Don't want you calling me Greg when I'm in the middle of hitting on some guy."
<P>"'Hitting on some guy?!'" Masami said. She stopped in her tracks, alarmed at Gwen's nonchalant statement. To make things worse, she suddenly began having fantasies of doing the exact same thing. After taking a second to suppress the feelings welling up inside her, she saw that Gwen was still walking away. "Wait! Wait!" she called, running after her friend once more. Nearby vacationers were treated to a dazzling show of flowing blue and white butterfly robes and luscious black locks dancing through the air.</p>
