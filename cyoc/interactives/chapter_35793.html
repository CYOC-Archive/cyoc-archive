<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan was wondering what to do with the game when the doorbell rang. She got up from the laptop and went to answer the door. When she opened the door she found a good looking man standing on the porch. He was about 5 foot 6 or 7 with brown hair in a buzz cut, penetrating green eyes, a winning smile that girls fall for, and a slight build that suggested he took care of himself. He was wearing a white t-shirt, blue jean shorts, and sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Megan&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; Megan said automatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I come in?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Megan said as she stepped back to let him in. She thought that she was being foolish inviting a strange man into her house but he knew her name.<br />
<br />
Just then Fred came in and asked darkly &quot;What are you doing here Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan invited me over&quot; Rick said seemingly oblivious to Fred's tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you to stay away from her&quot; Fred said taking a couple of steps toward Rick. &quot;You had your chance with Megan and you blew it. I won't have you showing up and confusing her all over again. She has just gotten her life back together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan had been edging closer to the laptop during Fred's rant. She figured that Rick was an old boyfriend of hers and that he had somehow hurt her. Fred was being very protective of her and she was afraid that he would hurt Rick. As for Rick, she had to give him credit. He wasn't backing down though she wondered if he trying to prove something to her. It didn't matter if he was being brave or just stupid, Megan wasn't about to let them get into a physical fight. The game was up and running so she clicked on Rick's character and selected female thinking that Fred wouldn't be upset about one of her girlfriends coming over.<br />
<br />
Megan watched as Rick shrunk to about 5 foot 4 and his hair grew down to his mid back. His arms and legs became more slender as his hips widened and his waist narrowed. His hands and feet became daintier. The last change on his body that Megan could see was his breasts growing to a c cup. Then his shorts changed to a denim skirt while his t-shirt and sandals became more feminine. Megan could just barely make out the shape of a bra under his shirt.<br />
<br />
The changes were done but Fred continued to look angry. Megan couldn't figure out why until he said &quot;She's no longer in her lesbian phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean 'her lesbian phase'?&quot; Rick asked with a slight quizzical look on his now feminine face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know exactly what I mean bitch&quot; Fred said. &quot;You just about destroy her life completely seducing her into your God forsaken lesbian lifestyle. Now you're back and trying to get her back into it. Well I have news for you Dianne, I WON'T ALLOW IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan invited me over&quot; Dianne said. &quot;I'm not trying to get her into the lesbian lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's bull shit&quot; Fred spat with such vehemence that Megan jumped. &quot;You know it and I know it&quot; Fred continued. &quot;Megan doesn't know it though and you're counting on that. I know you are so don't bother denying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred was right up close to Dianne now and Megan was afraid that he would hit her. She had to do something fast before he lost control. She clicked on Dianne's character and selected age five.<br />
<br />
Dianne began to grow younger and younger until she was a five year old girl. Megan noticed that Dianne looked like Kathy did at that age.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry that I yelled at you princess&quot; Fred said suddenly calm. &quot;But you know that when we have the red sign on our door that you're not suppose to come into Mommy and Daddy's room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sowwy Daddy&quot; Dianne said with a look of confusion on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are&quot; Fred said. &quot;Don't think that that's going to get you out of your punishment though. You can't go to your play group today. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Daddy&quot; Dianne said with tears in her eyes and a trembling lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to punish you but you need to learn not to come into our room when we have the red sign out&quot; Fred said kneeling down and hugging Dianne. &quot;I have to go to work now princess. Be a good girl for the rest of today and tomorrow and I may take you to get ice cream tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay Daddy&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
Fred got up and kissed Megan. &quot;Bye sweetness. Watch over our little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I will handsome&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
After Fred left Megan collapsed into the chair and started shaking. She wasn't sure if she wanted to be in a relationship with him anymore if he could get that angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay, wha goin on Mommy?&quot; Dianne asked with her arms crossed over her chest and a determined look on her face. The emphasis that she put on 'Mommy' startled Megan. It was as if she knew that she had been an adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you ask sweetie?&quot; Megan asked in way of a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shaking&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm just surprised that your Daddy yelled at you like that for coming into our room&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nu huh, dat not why&quot; Dianne said. &quot;You seen Daddy yell at me afore. You know I dult and a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan was surprised by that statement. The game had people's aware off by default. So how could Dianne know that she was an adult and a man? She clicked on Dianne's character again and looked at her aware toggle. To her surprise it was missing. After searching through the help files she found out why.<br />
<br />
'There are a few rare individuals that are naturally both aware and unaware. These individuals have memories of all realities caused by the changes. These individuals are unaffected by the aware toggle so it is disabled for them.'<br />
<br />
Now Megan had choice to make. She could try lying to Dianne or tell her the truth.</p>
