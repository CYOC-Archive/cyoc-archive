<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So...” Janette trailed as they sat down in a Mexican restaurant, she’d thrown on a comfortable little dress, nothing too fancy,just a nice pale blue dress with pair of matching shoes with no heel to them. Mason had done himself up a little casually too. His choice of restaurant was a bit odd though. She didn’t have anything against Mexican cuisine, but it didn’t exactly seem like first date food. “Is the food good here or?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno,” Mason replied with a dismissive shrug. “I keep passing this place on the way to school. It’ll be a new experience for both of us.”<br />
<br />
“Oh... that sounds... great...” she trailed before picking up her menu and burying her face in it. “Okay Janette,” she whispered to herself. “Maybe you think first dates are for safe restaurants you’re familiar with but you’re out with the boy of your dreams. You’re gonna love this.”<br />
<br />
She lowered her menu and smiled at Mason.<br />
<br />
“So... I’m not really familiar with Mexican food...” she trailed, tapping her fingers on the table and gazing around at all the decorations and wait staff.<br />
<br />
“Me neither,” he shrugged before turning to the waitress with a big grin on his face. “I’ll have that daily special.”<br />
<br />
“The quesadilla or the shredded pepper tacos?” The waitress asked.<br />
<br />
“Tacos,” Mason replied matter of factly. The waitress looked him up and down in concern.<br />
<br />
“I will warn you it is spicy. Like, we run two specials because of...” the waitress started to explain before Mason waved his hand. The woman turned to her in seconds and smiled.<br />
<br />
“I’m... I’ll have the Chile En Nogada... please,” she ordered shyly before handing her menu away and being left with Mason, who was gazing at her cheekily.<br />
<br />
“You like spicy food?” She asked hoping to break the ice.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” he shrugged. “Just felt like it tonight.”<br />
<br />
Yeah...” she trailed awkwardly, gazing around the restaurant. “This is... nice. A little unromantic, but nice.”<br />
<br />
“You gotta take risks Janette or nothing will ever change,” he told her and when their food arrived Janette started crying due to the wafting stench of spiciness drifting off the trip of tacos done up all fancy on his plate. Her own dish was a giant pepper covered with and stuffed with cheeses, meats, and normal spices normal people could digest. Mason didn’t seem bothered though.<br />
<br />
“Wanna try some?” He asked while picking up one of these horrible little hard shells.<br />
<br />
“I kind of like to not spend two hours on the toilet at three AM,” Janette admitted before starting to pick at her own food. Mason just shrugged and took a bite and he started crying tears the second it touched his tongue. He lowered his arms and chewed while a red hot searing pain shot through his tongue. His lips seemed to swell from the food touching his lips and it sounded like his jaw was cracking with each bite he took. Not to mention his eyes slowly losing that defined Asian shape and growing larger eyelashes.<br />
<br />
“Oh dat’sh hot,” he listed while Janette get her hunger leave her. Not really impressed by Mason anymore. She’d imagined him to be sweet not this over confident douchebag who felt the need to show off. Mason swallowed and shook his head, his face red and sweaty and darkening by the second into a tanned bronze colour. “Mmm, but it’s so good.”<br />
<br />
He took another bite, his tongue seeming to be more adjusted. As he chewed his jaw got smaller and stopped popping, his nose shrunk a little, and his nearly black hair started to fall into his eyes and turn into a sweet cocoa colour.<br />
<br />
“Maybe this was a bad idea,” Janette admitted with a sigh. “I’ve been pining after you so long I didn’t even realize who you were.”<br />
<br />
Mason’s waist caved in as he shoved the rest of that spicy taco in his face. It curved womanly and his abs and muscles shrunk but were no less defined and attractive. He hungrily grabbed for his second taco, the spice actually kind of nice.<br />
<br />
“I think that maybe my idea of who you were and who you actually are are separate things,” Janette sighed while placing her fork down.<br />
<br />
Mason’s hips flared outwards, his shoulders slumped inwards, and his hair began to becomes somewhat frizzy and weave itself into a crown of braids. The rest clumped behind his head in a big loose bun and a nice red flower set itself in the beautiful Cocoa locks.<br />
<br />
“You have to try this,” he moaned as his body hair retracted into his flesh, his ass inflated and pushed him upwards until he had a round scrumptious booty. His thighs changed to match and both his hands and feet turned dainty.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to try it, the smell makes my eyes water,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
His chest began to swell, the left breast growing out into a nice round supple form before its sister followed, then the plumbing downstairs shifted and she squirmed in her seat, feeling her clothes change until she was wearing a beautiful Mexican styled evening dress. The top turned pure white and her neckline expanded until it was over both shoulders, the straps of her bra visible. The sleeve shrunk until they were short and the neckline grew upwards before flopping down taking on a somewhat flowery design pattern of ruffles.<br />
<br />
Her waist was pinched in by a black belt like strip of fabric and her pants flared out turning as red as the flower in her hair and becoming a sweeping skirt. She swallowed the last of her food and get her voice change and her memories shift. She wasn’t a Korean-American boy named Mason, she was Maria, a beautiful girl from Mexico that had come to America for a student exchange program.<br />
<br />
“You hardly touched your food mi amor,” she said in a stunning Mexican accent that would have made anyone swoon.<br />
<br />
Janette looked up and noticed that Mason had been replaced by a stunningly gorgeous Hispanic woman. She had amazing curves, beautiful hair, a fit athletic body, and looked like a freaking model. Janette blushed bright red as she stared at the woman and looked around, wondering where Mason had gone.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute...” she trailed, rising to her feet. “The confidence, the strange lack of fear, this... YOU DRANK MY POTION!”<br />
<br />
“(I could drink your potion tonight if you want),”Maria flirted in absolutely perfect Spanish. She liked how Janette looked, a pretty white girl with breasts like pillows that she wanted nothing more than to lay her head on.<br />
<br />
“Donna, Donna can fix this,” Janette announced before making a move to leave. Maria just laughed and grabbed her wrist.<br />
<br />
“(The date isn’t over yet,)” she told Janette with a shake of her head before guiding her back to her chair and sitting her down in it again. “Eat your food, you’ll love it. Don’t you trust a Mexican girl to know if Mexican food is any good?”<br />
<br />
“But you’re supposed to be Mason,” Janette trembled.<br />
<br />
“Who is Mason? I’m Maria and you got me,” Maria smiled, leaning in and moving some hair out of her date’s eye. “We’ve still got a whole evening planned and it will be, how do you say... Um... wonderful.”</p>
