<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr Miller needs persuading to strip<br />
<br />
Mr Miller looked at the 2 women and crossed his arms angrily. He wasn't about to get naked because some little bitch ordered him to. &quot;Ok I <br />
guess you need some persuading&quot; Kat said, and she muttered some kind of spell.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mr Miller's ears started tickling intensely. He reached up to touch them and realized they were growing and were covered with hairs. <br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; he thought, &quot;I have dog ears!&quot;. He tried pulling at them which hurt. <br />
<br />
The dog training lady had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing. Seeing this arrogant man with big floppy dog ears was hilarious. &quot;Did that <br />
convince you to be a good doggy and obey me?&quot; Kat asked.  Mr miller tried to tell her that she better undue whatever she just did but again all <br />
that came out was angry bark. &quot;Just do what she says&quot;, Dan cried out from inside his cage, &quot;She's not joking around&quot;. Mr. Miller hesitated still <br />
not sure what to do. He was use to being in control of people and wasn't good at taking orders himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok fine.&quot; Kat said, and muttered another spell.  Suddenly Mr Miller grimaced in pain as he felt something pushing out of his spine just above <br />
his ass crack. The pain got worse as the bulge was pushing against his nicely fitting jeans. In a few seconds he had to unzip his fly and yanked <br />
down his pants and underwear to let his new tail spring out.  His fair sized dick and balls flopped out at the front as well. He reached around in <br />
shock as he grabbed his tail. He gave a pull which caused more pain and he realized that he now had a bushy dog's tail. The dog training lady <br />
now couldn't help laughing out loudly the site. This handsome macho man was yanking at his tail with a shocked look on his face, big fuzzy <br />
dog ears flopping around on his head and his very nice human male package bouncing around in front of him. He looked ridiculously funny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Want more?&quot;, Kat asked. &quot;Dad just do what she says!&quot;, his son implored, &quot;before she makes you into a total dog!&quot;.  Mr Miller put his hands in <br />
fear and indicated stop. He look at the three of them one at a time,  sighed and started to unbutton his shirt and his nicely haired muscular <br />
chest came into view, He took off his shirt then pulled down his pants and underwear and stepped out of them. And stood up and covered his <br />
privates. He was blushing head to toe. He had a hairy flat abdomen and some bushy pubic hair was showing above his hands as he tried to <br />
cover himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dogs don't wear socks!&quot; Kat yelled. Mr Miller obediently  reached down and pulled off one sock at at time. His heavy balls were swinging <br />
obscenely as tried to keep balance fist on one foot then the other.  Mr Miller now stood totally naked in front of his step daughter and the <br />
young women he had recently been banging. He had floppy dog's ears and a dog's tail. He knew he had a good body and was usually proud to <br />
show it off in the locker room and to women he fucked but now he felt so humiliated. It was even worse that his son was witnessing all this.<br />
<br />
Ok good doggie, now get in that cage. Mr Miller mournfully reached down to open the small door to the cage he had to get on all fours to crawl <br />
in. &quot;That tail really matches your hairy butt.&quot;, the dog training lady teased. She was revelling in this jerk finally getting his up-commence. Mr <br />
Miller hated that she was staring at his ass and was acutely aware of his big scrotum flapping freely between his thighs which she was also, no <br />
doubt, getting a great look at . He got in and crawled up against the far bars pulling his legs up to to cover himself the way Dan was sitting <br />
beside him. <br />
<br />
Kat and the young women came over and closed the door and stared at their two good-looking male prisoners.  One a cute teenager and the <br />
other a macho man in his thirties with doggy ears and a tail. Both looked so cute and helpless as they stared out in fear. <br />
<br />
The dog training lady smiled and Kat then turned to the nude men. &quot;Well you two have a good doggy nap and we will feed you later. Better rest <br />
up because soon we are going to have a dog show and you two will be the star performers. Half the town will be hear so you better both be on <br />
your best behaviour.&quot;<br />
Both naked men's eyebrows went up at this last remark. How could they be seen like this is public? As the 2 ladies walked away Dan's dad <br />
called after them with mournful bark. He was hoping that Kat would take away his ridiculous dog appendages. The ladies laughed and walked <br />
away. Neither father nor son could bear looking at each other for the moment, so they both sat silently with there gaze lowered, waiting for <br />
what ever further degradation awaited them.</p>
