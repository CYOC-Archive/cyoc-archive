<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie now wished for the two to become a couple as she made her wish. The girls watched as the 18 year old man began to age. At 18 he seemed a little skinny but as he entered his twenties. He appeared to gain a little bit of muscle on his chest an arms as he smooth face seemed to mature. Katie ended his progression at 27 and sat back to admire her work. Although still slovenly dressed the girls could see he appeared to have a decent amount of muscle on his chest and arms, topped with a mop of sandy brown hair. The man looked slightly nervous as he was sitting in the booth as he gazed around the restaurant.<br />
<br />
For the woman the girls could see her regression clearly. Leaving her forties and entering her thirties the girls noticed the lines around her eyes lessen while her dark brown hair began to lighten. As she reached thirty the girls could see an unlined face with gorgeous hair and firm b cup breasts. Katie regressed her a few more years leaving the woman 27, just like the man in front of her. Her face while unlined and attractive looked tense, her dark brown hair seemed frazzled as if she had just come from work. The woman was still in a dress, that while nice, was underwhelming in comparison to what other patrons were wearing. Curious as to why this was the girls listened intently as the woman glared at her date.<br />
<br />
“Travis,” the woman hissed. “You know you could of dressed up. I mean this is one of the fancier places in town. You look like you came straight from the shop and you didn’t even shave today.”<br />
<br />
Travis blushed slightly as he looked at the woman in front of him. “I’m sorry Beth,” he said. “I was running late. The last car I was repairing took longer than I expected. Besides I know how you hate me running late.”<br />
<br />
Beth sighed as she looked at Travis. “Okay true,” she said. “But still you know we can’t really afford this place. You haven’t been bringing home as much money lately and money is tight enough as is. Being a secretary doesn’t exactly pay a ton.”<br />
<br />
Travis smiled as he apologized yet again. “I’m sorry hon,” he grinned. “I know money has been tight. The thing is though there’s a reason. I’ve Uh, I’ve kinda been holding some money back lately.”<br />
<br />
Beth’s eyes flashed with rage as she glared at Travis. “What,” she hissed. “Travis what the hell. You know how hard it’s been paying for everything lately. I even asked my boss about a promotion. Something in management that might actually pay a decent salary.”<br />
<br />
Travis grinned as he stared at Beth. He knew she hated being assertive at work. She worked so hard at that job and should have been promoted ages ago. He found it ironic that his actions for their future may have finally pushed Beth to get the position she so rightly deserved.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Hey, Hey,” he said holding his arms up defensively. “Look I’m sorry but I think you might like what I got.”<br />
<br />
Beth narrowed her eyes as she glared at her boyfriend. “Ugh what dumbass thing did you get now,”<br />
<br />
Travis smiled as he produced a diamond ring from his pocket and presented it Beth. “Well was kind of interested to know if you would marry me.”<br />
<br />
Beth’s hands flew to her mouth as she let out a squeak. “Yes, yes a thousand times YES!” She squealed as she jumped across the table into her future husbands arms. Travis grinned as he tried to brace himself from falling over. “So honey do good,” he asked still grinning.<br />
<br />
Beth wiped her eyes as she gazed at her fiancé. “Yes,” she sniffed. “Honey do very good.”<br />
<br />
The restaurant now broke into applause as Travis placed the ring on his tearful fiancée. Beth blushed and continued to cry as she turned and thanked everyone. As she went back to her seat their waiter approached. “Sir, mame,” he said. “The manager would like to pay for your meal this evening as a congratulations on this momentous event.” Travis and Beth thanked their waiter as they now began to talk about their wedding plans. <br />
<br />
The girls, touched by the scene, smiled and wiped their eyes yelling congratulations of their own to the newly engaged couple. “That was sooo cute,” Mika sighed. The girls nodded in agreement as they began to talk happily while scanning the menus.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys,” a girl called from the entrance. Turning the girls were shocked by what they saw.<br />
<br />
Donna and Cassie had entered the restaurant with their parents. While their parents now spoke with the hostess about a table for four the two girls ran to where the girls were sitting. The girls couldn’t help but grin as they looked Donna and Cassie’s dresses. Donna was wearing a light blue dress with a pair of flat. To accent her outfit and stay true to her fan girl roots they noticed a necklace around her neck with a Superman emblem broach. Cassie in turn was sporting a purple dress with a pair of small heels. Cassie even put a purple streak in her hair that perfectly complimented her dress.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys how’s it going,” Katie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Dona and Cassie grinned broadly as they stood next to the table. “Go ahead Cass ask them,” Donna encouraged pushing her friend forward. Cassie blushed as she now looked at the older girls. “Um well it’s like this,” Cassie stammered. “We...Uh...we want to really thank you guys for everything this past year.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Donna added. “I mean Katie, Kellie you two have always been so nice to us. And Claudia and Mika well you really looked out for us since we started high school. Things would have been brutal without you two looking out for us.”<br />
<br />
“Plus Ms. Walters loves you guys as students,” Cassie added. <br />
<br />
Donna nudged her friend slightly and smiled. “Cass you can call her mom now,” she giggled.<br />
<br />
Cassie giggled slightly before apologizing. “Sorry,” she said shyly. “Anyway between you guys and Samantha and Mary we...Well we wanted to do something special to kind of say thank you.”<br />
<br />
Cassie now began to blush fiercely as she fished a group of envelopes out of her purse.<br />
<br />
“What are those,” Mika asked.<br />
<br />
Donna grinned broadly before answering. “Wedding invitations,” she said.<br />
<br />
Katie, Kellie, Claudia and Mika’s jaws dropped as theys stared at the wedding envelopes. “Mom said we could invite a few friends to the wedding and you guys were the first ones we thought of.”<br />
<br />
“The wedding is July 15th,” Cassie added shyly. “Really hope you guys can make it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh and don’t tell Mary and Sammy we want to surprise them,” Donna added with a wink.<br />
<br />
The girls scontinued to gaped as Donna and Cassie’s parents now called for them. The two freshman now waved goodbye as they ran to join their parents.<br />
<br />
“Did we just get invited to a WEDDING,”  Claudia exclaimed. Mika nodded in shocked silence, unable to to speak as she stared at the envelope.<br />
<br />
Katie also found herself speechless as she continued to look at her envelope. Turning to face her girlfriend Katie could see her grinning broadly. “Told you you did good,” she smiled as she squeezed Katie’s hand.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and returned to staring at the envelope, still shocked that in two months she would have the opportunity to dance with her girlfriend at an actual wedding.</p>
