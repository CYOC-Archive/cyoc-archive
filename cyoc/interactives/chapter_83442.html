It was just an accident...                  by a random guy.<br />
<br />
The rain sped down from the clouds until smashing to the ground in a large splash. The sky was a dark gray and the rain was deafening and painful.<br />
<br />
And Cal was right in the middle of it. No coat, no boots, no hat, not a thing to protect Cal from the bashing storm. He was walking home from another boring, long day at school. Only to go home and work on endless hours of painstaking homework. In the morning the sun had been shining, the clouds had been scarce, and Cal didn&#39;t expect such a rapid change in the weather. And now he was getting hulk smashed by every drop.<br />
<br />
Cal was a 13 year old, straight guy. Nothing special about him, just peeking into early adolescence. Back at school for another dreadful year. His one true friend was the only person he could trust. His name was Jones, and he was only about two months older than Cal. Before going back to school they would visit each other&#39;s houses on a daily basis, but school made things too busy for anything like that.<br />
<br />
He was finally getting close to home, rain still pouring. Just on time, he reached the door when hailstones began to pound the earth. He pulled the door handle. Locked.<br />
<br />
Cal sighed as the hail began to reach larger proportions. Cal looked up and realized the beauty of the moment. The sky was ice. Moving ice, falling gracefully in what seemed to be slow motion. An ice sky. Cal closed his eyes and breathed in the moment, lifting his arms to his sides, eyes still closed -<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!&quot; Cal grunted in his squeaky, unbroken voice. An exceedingly heavy hailstone had landed in his wide open hand. Cal woke up from his splendiferous dreamy moment and opened his eyes quickly, directing them to his hand.<br />
<br />
Cal sat on his doorstep in the crunching hail and took a look at the piece of ice that was -<br />
        <br />
wait, ice? It wasn&#39;t ice. It definitely couldn&#39;t be ice. It was gleaming... like silver, but still had the translucent properties of ice. Cal tried to focus on a gleam but whenever he finally focused, it moved, dancing around the object like a ballerina on stage. <br />
<br />
Cal waited, and propped himself up on the door of the house, examining the piece of &quot;ice&quot; and waiting for one of his parents to return home to unlock the house.<br />
<br />
Although he didn&#39;t get to wait for long, because suddenly the door behind him opened and he rolled backwards with a fright.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Who&#39;s that?&quot; Cal whispered, almost silently. He took small, creeping steps around the entrance hall of the house. All the lights were either off or dimmed to save energy, which only added to the spooky and story-like atmosphere of the moment. Cal almost laughed - it was like some scary story. One of the stories that only cheesy little children would tell on Halloween. But the more that Cal searched, the less sure he became that anyone was there at all. Could the door... just have... opened itself? It was definitely locked when he tried it first. Maybe he didn&#39;t pull it hard enough. Besides, he didn&#39;t have much strength anyway. Yeah, it was just that...<br />
<br />
Of course it wasn&#39;t. How could it be? Doors don&#39;t just open themselves.<br />
<br />
No, no. Of course. It was just an accident. It was just an accident...<br />
<br />
With the wind in disagreement, Cal finally closed the door. He brought the... piece of... stuff into his room and switched on the light. He put the icy material onto his desk. Would it melt? Was it even ice?<br />
<br />
[|=|]<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hooome!&quot; a feminine voice shouted from downstairs. Cal jumped in his seat. He had been doing his mathematics and English homework while listening to music on his laptop. He was enjoying the chilled, laid back atmosphere of the room. It was the first time in his life that he was actually happy to do his homework. <br />
<br />
He had completely forgotten about the ice, and he walked down the flight of stairs to say &#39;hello&#39; to his recently-arrived mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Cal. How are you?&quot; Cal&#39;s mother asked. Why was that question so frustrating? He never knew how to answer it - with a &#39;fine, thanks&#39;, or something more polite and interesting? He didn&#39;t have enough time to think about his options, so he simply said &quot;Good&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to whip you up some dinner, dear. It&#39;s quite late, did you get home okay?&quot; Cal&#39;s mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it was pretty wet. I... uh, had a jacket though. So... yeah, I&#39;m not like... wet or anything.&quot; It was so very difficult to have a conversation with his own mother. <br />
<br />
He hopped back up the stairs to his bedroom and finished up his homework, just in time to hear his mother calling for dinner time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got something special for your first week at school, Cal,&quot; Cal&#39;s mother said happily, with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you never get Chinese! How do you even know that I like it?&quot; Cal exclaimed, but he couldn&#39;t keep the glad smile away from his genuinely happy face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know a lot more about you than you might think, Callum Radley,&quot; Cal&#39;s mother said with a babying smile.<br />
<br />
A normal teenage guy like Cal wouldn&#39;t like that kind of thing... but Cal didn&#39;t want to grow to old for that kind of thing. He was afraid of becoming another person as an adult, someone that he wasn&#39;t. He was afraid of forgetting his childhood, forgetting how the past used to be. He was afraid of losing his friend, Jones. He was afraid of losing the life that he had, even if it wasn&#39;t the best.<br />
<br />
Little did Callum know that his life was about to change. Completely. And barely a hint of the past would be remembered.</p>
