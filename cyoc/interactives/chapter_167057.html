<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was kind of funny - she should have been panicking right now, or pinching herself to wake up from this freaky dream. She had scales, for crap&#39;s sake! Scales and webbing growing out of her body! It was completely against everything she knew about biology... but it wasn&#39;t like it hurt, or anything. No, not at all. There wasn&#39;t a hint of pain as she took in a breath and examined the iridescent silver flakes. If anything, they were soft to the touch, a cool feeling running up her arms as she examined the texture. The webbing between her hands was flexible, sure to assist with swimming, yet hardly restricting her movements at all. And what had happened to her chest... well, she&#39;d never been lacking in that department, but she wasn&#39;t about to complain about getting a bit more up there.<br />
<br />
Joanna reached down, grabbing the bottle and staring into its partially-depleted contents. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out the connection between what this stuff was called, and what resulted from the spill. If she consumed the rest, then logically, she&#39;d become something unfit for land... and maybe that wasn&#39;t such a bad thing. Her life wasn&#39;t exactly the greatest story ever told. Oh sure, she had looks, a job, friends, a boyfriend - but the looks just earned catcalls, the job was miserable, her friends had drifted away over the years, and her boyfriend mostly just drove her up the damn wall. Given the opportunity to leave it all behind, to become something exotic and incredible, to explore a whole other world unlike anything she&#39;d ever known.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t woken up expecting to abandon her whole life, but... maybe this was worth embracing.<br />
<br />
The bottle was quickly set down, firmly secured in a cup holder, before she tore off. If she was going to do this, she had to do it now, before any little nibbling doubts could change her mind. Now, truly, was the perfect time - the summer made it a perfect time to visit the beach, but at this hour, the nearest beach wouldn&#39;t be open. She could slip in there, finish off the bottle without anyone seeing her, and then... well, whatever happened would happen. Somehow, she felt okay with the uncertainity right now.<br />
<br />
Anticipation built more and more as she flew down the highway, the final leg of the trip being relatively free of traffic. No big rush of cars down to the beaches right now - perfect. She found a nice, secluded place to park, figuring it was best to avoid being seen as much as possible. With so few people around, however, it was relatively easy to slip out of her car unseen, the bottle clutched in her hands as she tried to hide her scaly forearms from anyone who might catch a glimpse of her. It was already going to be strange enough if they saw some woman with a strained blouse and business skirt hopping around the beach at this hour.<br />
<br />
Within a few minutes she was able to find a spot not quite so open as most of the beach was, between a grouping of rocks. Just enough privacy that Joanna could feel confident in setting the bottle down and peeling her clothing off. By now all her garments had grown wet, splashed by the early-morning surf, and leaving her body damp even after she was nude. It was oddly soothing - the water against her skin felt right. Maybe it was the bottle&#39;s contents already at work, or maybe her mind was already adjusting herself to what she knew was coming. As nice as it felt, did that really matter.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of pause as she sat down and uncorked the bottle, holding it in both hands gingerly as she looked out at the gently-rolling waves. If this stuff really worked... those rolling tides would be her home in a few minutes. Her neck started to turn to look back at the land behind her, but she stopped herself. No, no. No turning back. Not even a moment of consideration could be given to that. This was her chance to escape every miserable part of her life, and if she let herself be tempted away from it now, she&#39;d never be able to forgive herself.<br />
<br />
With one grand motion she brought the bottle to her lips, pouring the whole thing back in a single gulp. The liquid was cool against her throat, like a crisp, cool water with a hint of a tangy taste. She was disappointed when there was no more, but soon tossed the bottle off to the side, distracted by the feeling that began to cascade through her body. She could feel it rippling, a soothing sensation that started in her core and wound its way across the whole of her form. Like thousands of gentle hands carefully massaging her body, providing such a feeling of bliss that she sighed and laid back, eyes lazily looking over her body as it began to change.<br />
<br />
The scales were the first thing to catch her gaze. They emerged all the way up and down her legs, thousands of tiny golden dots sparkling as they grew over her skin. They were just as smooth to the touch as her arm-scales had been, in far greater quantity and scale. She held up one leg, admiring how it glistened in the morning sun, but quickly remembered to bring it back down, close against the other leg. Fortunate timing, as she began to feel them pulled together, like magnets being tugged against one each other. <br />
<br />
Deep down, she had feared that it would be painful when her two legs became one tail. There was no such agony to be found, but instead, a feeling of warmth pouring over both extremities as they became like jelly, pushing and pulling into each other. Their mass joined together effortlessly, the bones producing a delightfully odd feeling as their shape altered, becoming part of one flexible structure. She watched in amazement as the now-joined limb lengthened, its girth reducing towards the end in exchange for impressive length, at least six feet of tail. Her feet, of course, looked odd, but that soon changed as she felt them flattening out, the material thinning out into an opaque fin. The coloration of it especially caught her eye - the golden scales along the main fin structure framed a beautiful silver fin, wide and powerful to ensure she could travel through the water at breakneck speed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the feeling of warmth shot back up her tail, spreading to her hips. She moaned in equal parts surprise and pleasure as she felt their width increasing, and something bulging out; in seconds the strange growth flared out into a pair of fins, one on each side, silver with gold framing much like the one at the end of her tail. The fins quickly spread down her tail on each side, tapering down to the middle where they stopped. Excitedly she felt them between her webbed hands, sighing pleasantly at the way the membrane squished under pressure from her fingers.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was inevitable that her fingers would soon drift towards her waist, where the scales faded to skin gaining a delightful bronzed coloration. Curious digits wandered, wondering if it was still there - she gasped as they suddenly found their objective. Fully intact womanhood, hidden carefully between scales yet easily called forth. Without a moment more consideration, her fingers plunged inside, forcing Joanna to moan ever louder as she felt the scales and membranes that had engulfed her hands tickle against the inside of her folds. A splash of water from the lapping waves brought a further burst of intense pleasure, her other hand quickly joining in with exposing her opening to the wonders of her new physique.<br />
<br />
To her delight, she felt the same wamrth as before traveling upwards, bringing with it the realization that yet more changes were in store. The golden scales traveled up the side of her body, lingering at her ribcage as she felt the flesh moved aside in three slits on each side - gills, subtle yet visible, especially as silvery scales formed around them in a pretty display of contrast. Their work done here, the scales continued upwards, joining with those that had partially engulfed her chest. The whole of the soft flesh was quickly subsumed beneath golden sparkles as their size was enhanced even further; rock-hard nipples and the areola around them remained distinct in shape and in color, the same silver detailing present in the scales that covered them.<br />
<br />
A new line of the scales shot up her spine, bringing with it a chill that did not abate even as they reached the base of her neck, spreading out in a thin line down each shoulder from there. The line soon joined with her scale-covered forearm, perfectly centered on the outside of each arm. New pressure began to build on the outer edge of her forearms, released when a fin emerged from each, much like the ones along her tail, but instead stretching from elbow to wrist. <br />
<br />
Her ministrations and arousal only picked up as the final steps were taken. Her tongue emerged to lick at her lips as they plumped, their natural texture becoming slightly metallic and shiny, their shade becoming golden with a stripe of silver down the center. Her eyes opened wide, green irises giving way to soft golden hues as a silvery color appeared around her eyes, creating an eyeshadow effect all the way to her hairline. She had expected by now that her brown locks would adopt the same color scheme - instead, she glanced down to find that her hair, now stretching down to where her tail began, had become a brilliant shade of royal purple, sharply contrasting the precious-metal scheme of her scales and fins.<br />
<br />
With the final changes came an explosion within her, pleasure rippling out like a supernova from the magic that sealed her new form. She cried out, shoving her hands deep as she could within herself as the new mermaid&#39;s first orgasm spiraled into a wave of pleasurable releases. Even when the last in the storm had subsided and she pulled her hands off to the side, her body still burned with pleasure. Merely looking at the beauty of her new form caused the excitement to rise and her heart to race. Oh, how she wished she could become human once more simply to experience the joy of the transformation all over again!<br />
<br />
But her human days were over. Joanna had become a mermaid, and as she pulled herself towards the ocean, letting the tide carry her away, there wasn&#39;t a single shred of regret. All she could think about now was the first thing she would do as a gorgeous creature of the seas.</p>
