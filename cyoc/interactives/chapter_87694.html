<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It started out as a normal Saturday, anyway. I had discovered last Monday that I was out of my favorite orange nail polish, and I&#39;d been looking forward all week to using it as an excuse to go shopping. I had invited a couple of coworkers to go to the new mall downtown, and we spent hours browsing from the clothes to the book store to toy gadgets. I didn&#39;t end up buying very much; the nail polish I wanted, plus a technical book on how cars work and a cute jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, this was great!&quot; Alice said. &quot;Thanks so much for inviting me.&quot; Alice was the graphic designer at the small software company we worked at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! I quite enjoyed the experience as well,&quot; Kim added. &quot;It was nice to get out of the house.&quot; Kim was one of the two engineers working on our website; I&#39;m the product manager for our little group. If you&#39;d asked me at age 16 what I wanted to do when I grew up, I wouldn&#39;t have said &quot;manage plans for new features on a period tracker app&quot;, but it was enjoyable enough, and it was a huge windfall for a 21 year old like me, who&#39;d dropped out of high school. Don&#39;t do anime, kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thank you for agreeing to come,&quot; I said. &quot;It means a lot to me that you&#39;d humor the company nerd like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim chuckled. &quot;Oh, you think you&#39;re the nerd. See you around,&quot; and walked away without further fanfare.<br />
<br />
Wow, still getting used to her. &quot;Was it something I said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she&#39;s just like that, dear,&quot; Alice said. &quot;&quot;I&#39;ll see you next week, then. Have a nice Saturday, Karen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; I said. &quot;Later!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh and I had planned to meet up outside the mall at five, to go go-carting; it was now four-thirty, so I still had some time left before I had to be there. I went over to a bench just inside the mall&#39;s big front doors and sat down. I looked out the window, and watched the cars driving by. I&#39;ve been developing an interest in how cars work, lately; mine had broken down several weeks before, and the mechanic I brought it to explained each thing he did as he did it.<br />
<br />
[Author&#39;s note: I don&#39;t actually know much about how cars work. Please suspend any disbelief.]<br />
<br />
I heard a loud bang outside. I rushed out to see what it was, my shopping bag forgotten; several people were looking at the bus sitting at the bus stop across the street, but nothing else seemed abnormal - nobody looked hurt that I could see, thankfully.<br />
<br />
The bus must have been what made the sound, because I heard it start, and then pull away. Josh was standing behind where it had been, with a piece of candy in his hand and a confused look on his face. He must have been early for our meeting time, too. He wasn&#39;t looking at me, so I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d noticed I was there yet;  I turned to go back inside.<br />
<br />
Josh has been my best friend for years, since I stood up for him once when we were in elementary school. Neither of us have ever really had anyone else to go to - our parents all had the &quot;kids should be tough&quot; mindset, and we were both too nerdy for the popular kids at school. He&#39;s two years younger than I am - not that you&#39;d know that these days, with how much of a kid I act like - and we&#39;ve always gone to each other to share our successes and failures, for a shoulder to cry on, or when just feeling lonely.<br />
<br />
I had my hand out to pull the door open when it happened. I suddenly felt a breeze across my whole body; I glanced down, not sure what to expect - it felt remarkably like wearing a light dress, but I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Except I wasn&#39;t. I was completely nude. I shrieked, and spun around automatically, looking around frantically for any reason for my sudden nudity. Josh had noticed me now, and was starting with wide eyes - I&#39;m pretty attractive, and he hasn&#39;t seen me naked before, so I couldn&#39;t blame him - but just as suddenly, I was clothed again. What the fuck?<br />
<br />
Josh was hammering the crosswalk button. The light changed immediately, and he sprinted across the street.  &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said, as soon as he got close enough to not shout. &quot;Holy shit, holy shit, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! I wasn&#39;t even thinking!&quot;<br />
<br />
What the fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck. &quot;What are you apologizing for exactly?&quot; I said. &quot;Are you saying you know why I was, um, naked, just now? That you did that somehow?&quot;<br />
<br />
He fidgeted awkwardly, playing with a ring on his right hand that I didn&#39;t remember ever having seen him wear before. &quot;Well, er,&quot; he said, &quot;You&#39;re not going to believe me,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; I said, and chuckled. &quot;My clothes just disappeared, came back, and then you apologize. Let&#39;s hear this story, Jay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Alright. So I got here early. I was bored at home and stuff, so I figured I&#39;d just come hang out here until you were ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; I said. What did that have to do with it?<br />
<br />
&quot;I got bored of waiting, so I went in to the gas station and got this.&quot; He held up the small bag of gummy worms he was holding. &quot;An old lady left her purse at the counter, though, so I ran it out to give to her before she got on the bus. As soon as I handed it to her, the bus, well, died,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that must have been the sound I heard, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was pretty loud, so probably, anyway she gave me this ring,&quot; he held his other hand up, &quot;And said it would grant my fondest wishes, which sounded like superstition,&quot; he fidgeted with his hand again and trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she said that it could grant wishes, and she told me to wish that nobody could take it off, and I made that wish, and then she got on the bus and left. And I mean, I didn&#39;t think it would actually work, so I picked someone from the crowd in front of the mall and wished their clothes would d-disappear...&quot; He gulped. &quot;Please don&#39;t be mad...&quot;<br />
<br />
I stared at him. Then I stared at him some more. &quot;You&#39;re saying you made a wish and it actually worked.&quot; It wasn&#39;t really a question; of course that&#39;s what he had just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Wow.&quot; He paused and blinked, and looked around. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.&quot;</p>
