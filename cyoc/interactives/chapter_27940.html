<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first blast from Steve stuffed Paul's mouth.  With cum leaking out, Paul felt Steve's dick expanding for its next shot.  His mouth already full, it couldn't hold the the additional meat.  Steve's cock hurled another wad of cum out the tip hitting Paul under his chin.  Paul could see this beast was not going back into his mouth.  He grasped the underside of the head with both hands and massaged, while rubbing the front and top against his chin and the top of his chest.  This time he could feel it grow as the third shot worked its way down the shaft.  The ejaculation covered his shrinking chest with cum from neck to navel.<br />
<br />
After three shots, Paul felt Steve's pole soften considerably.  With it drooping towards the earth again, Paul flipped onto his back again and positioned himself beneath Steve's mammoth nuts.  Steve's tip rested on Paul's slick body while Paul wrapped his muscular arms around both of the balls above him.  Their weight and volume was increasing quickly now.  Unbeknownst to him, the shrinking force once limited to just Steve's balls was now magnified by Don's nearby orbs.  Fingers each as big as his arms -- Steve's fingers -- rubbed Paul's stiffy.  Knowing his own orgasm was assured, Paul focused his whole attention on the rough flesh in his grasp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For his part, during the third shot Matt's grip had come loose.  Slickened by fluids and weakened by resisting two passing blasts, the whole passageway had rocked and shook.  Eyes milky from the viscous fluid, Matt was enveloped in a grey field as all sense of gravity and motion left him.  For an instant he was suspended in time, freely floating and traveling the same speed as the liquid envelope around him.<br />
<br />
Was he going to shrink forever?  Matt breathed, finding himself conveniently trapped in an air bubble.  The thought should have terrified him, but instead he found his present circumstances very relaxing.<br />
<br />
Just as soon as he reclined into his warm, wet weightlessness, it abruptly ended.  With a crash, a shockwave popped his air bubble and Matt felt himself plunged deep into the fluid around him.  Flailing around he felt something rough and pitted.  Sputtering, up became down and down became up as he endeavored to grasp the only solid thing around him.  His lungs burned for air, and just as he started seeing stars, the tide receeded.  He was beached.<br />
<br />
Grateful to be alive and breathing again he looked around.  He had landed on a brown rocky surface, pitted and broken but most importantly jutting above the white foamy sea which extended in all directions.  Other rocks broke through the surface at crazy angles, some shooting directly into the sky but none within swimming distance.  In one direction the horizon was blurred, his eyes unable to focus on anything clearly.<br />
<br />
Realization took a few moments to dawn as he looked in the other direction.  Impossibly far away and much larger than any earthly mountain, an erect penis was thrust against the backdrop of the sky.  Standing up, Matt watched something even larger reach down to gently rub the god-like organ.  Ejected from Steve's cavern, Matt worked out that he had been shot the entire distance to Paul's navel.  Something had broken the timelessness spell, and now Steve was finishing Paul off.  Watching Steve's fingers continue to balloon, Matt knew the feeling in the pit of his stomach was the field of shrinking continuing to whittle him away.<br />
<br />
Losing his footing, Matt stumbled and looked at his feet.  The portion of the rock -- the hair -- above &quot;sea level&quot; was dipping.  More than that, it was narrowing.  Matt realized Paul was shrinking faster now.  It was an arousing thought except for the realization he was about to be plunged back into the ocean.  Looking around for any other options, he didn't even see Steve's fingertip closing in on him.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is he shrinking?&quot; Don asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Steve replied, not looking up.  He swirled his fingers through the cum-soaked fur on Paul's small tummy and then returned his freshly-lubricated fingertips to Paul's shortening cock.  &quot;But isn't it awesome?  I've wanted to do this for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to shrink my dad?&quot; Don asked, more confused but intrigued as the moments passed, his own dick now fully erect.  In truth Don had fantasized about shrinking his dad more than once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Paul specifically,&quot; Steve answered.  &quot;Anybody would have been fine really.&quot;  Don drew closer and watched his dad's form contract.  A once-mighty cock had been reduced to tiny proportions.  The very testicles that had produced Don now dwindled away.  Steve looked up from his little quarry to consider Don.  The younger man was completely transfixed by the sight, the outline of his erection clearly visible against his shorts.  Paul's hips began to thrust.  &quot;I think he's about to cum,&quot; Steve said.  &quot;Do you want the honors of getting your old man off?  I'm sure he'll appreciate it.&quot;</p>
