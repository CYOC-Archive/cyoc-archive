<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing there naked Jim relished in the jocks admiration and allowed them to take in the beautiful and immortal body standing before them. Mulling through his head which power he should implement, which way he should show the former bullies who he had become and what he was capable of, Jim settled on his ability to enslave the minds of humans and bend them to his will. He knew what he wanted to do and how he was going to do it. He was going to both punish and reward the jocks while using his newly formed and acquired powers.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the jocks Jim lifted and curled his arms as he commanded his body to transform into one of ash and smoke. In a second he disintegrated and became a mass of black smoke as he began circling himself around the room.<br />
<br />
Ron, the lead bully, was still fascinated with the transformation of Jim, not to mention his powers. He and his cronies followed the smoke not knowing what to expect but too hypnotized to find out. But within the second they did.<br />
<br />
The cloud quickly attached and fell over the three of them, locking them into a standing position and unable to move except for their necks and eyes. &quot;Whaatttssss happening to us?!&quot; said Paul, one of Ron's fellow jocks. &quot;Oh Fuuucccckkkk!!&quot; said Ron he could feel the smoke not only getting under his clothes but also shredding them to bits. His black t-shirt ripped in one shred exposing his cut torso, abs and pecs. He looked over to see his friends quickly losing their clothes as they too became shredded and fell onto the ground.<br />
<br />
Ron felt his shorts and shoes split before him, leaving him in his boxers and socks. Soon his socks began to disintegrate leaving him with his feet cold to the ground. He knew the smoke was going to leave him naked, he was less worried about his clothes than his own consciousness, his own control over himself. As he felt his boxers fall away leaving him completely naked he looked over to Paul and Samuel and noticed their clothing falling leaving them completely nude as well.<br />
<br />
Ron regained control of his body only for a moment but was forced forward as he lost control of his feet. He fell to his knees as they buckled up toward his chest and his abs bent inward. Crouched and curled on the ground he could feel the smoke entering his body. &quot;Argh!&quot; Ron shouted as this supernatural being entered into him. &quot;What's happening to me...?!&quot; he shouted feeling his mind shifting. But to what?<br />
<br />
Soon his fears began disappearing, he actually started to enjoy what was happening to him though he couldn't tell what exactly. He started to like this situation, though, be content with himself. The more he thought the happier he got, this Jim guy wasn't so bad after all, he was a god, right?! A supernatural power-ridden being! &quot;I want to be like him&quot; Ron thought, &quot;I can if I only listen to him and do what he says, I can become muscular like him. Maybe he'll even give me some of his own powers!&quot;<br />
<br />
The intoxicating fantasy of becoming power-ridden like his friend Jim was too much. The excitement was giving him a hard-on. Enthusiastic about his new purpose in life, he felt in control of his body again. His mind started to connect with his friends, they were thinking the same thing. Standing at the same time and casually exposing their erections, they all could communicate with each other telepathically and were all in the same state of happiness with their realization. They too could become gods if they listened to the power-ridden Jim! He was telling them they could! And as a gift from Jim they each received a burst of muscle. Looking down, Ron noticed his naked quads, ass, up through his abs, pecs and arms grow out in muscular extacy. Any fear or embarrassment of being naked washed away from him. &quot;Being nude is my natural state,&quot; after all, he said with a smile, &quot;this is who I am, this is who I'm meant to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt the cloud leave his body and return him to his own control. Looking ahead Ron and his friends watched in admiration as the cloud reformed their godly leader who was so kind to give him his muscular boost. Jim formed back into his natural self and smiled down at the guys who smiled back in eager anticipation of his order.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are yours to command,&quot; Ron said, stepping forward.<br />
<br />
Jim smiled, thinking what to command them to do next.</p>
