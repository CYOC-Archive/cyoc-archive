<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up to Allison (if I could even call her that) sitting on the floor looking around in a daze. I too was coming out of my daze and wondering what had just happened. The feelings that had hit me had been extremely strong. Now that I was awake I didn&#39;t feel them as strongly anymore. Looking at Allison just confused me...in a few different ways. The desire that I had felt was quickly being replaced with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup man...you finally awake?&quot; Allison was talking to me now, in a rough slow speech that seemed wrong somehow. He was still naked but he didn&#39;t seem to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...are you...ok Allison? What happened to you?&quot; I was still waking up and started to notice a tightness in my chest, but I figured that was from being on the floor in an awkward position. I sat up and put my back against the wall and looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison? I dunno, I kinda remember that Allison but it&#39;s really faint. I feel more like an Andy now. Don&#39;t I look a lot more like an Andy bro??&quot; he sat up and started to flex his biceps with a dumb look on his face. He looked just like some guy you&#39;d see at the beach. He was hot, blond, muscular, and it seemed like he didn&#39;t have the higher IQ that Allison boasted. It wasn&#39;t as arousing as before to see him sit there and flex in the nude but it was still pretty nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...sure Andy. Maybe we should see the...&quot; I was saying just as the sales attendant came back into the room. He looked over at &quot;Andy&quot; and smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well! Those had a really good effect on you I see! You look better already! It looks like those flip flops were a perfect fit.&quot; the attendant was looking at Andy with a bit of a lustful gleam in his eyes...and looking down I could see what he meant. The flip flops fit perfectly now on Andy&#39;s bigger feet. Although that was all he was really wearing at this point.<br />
<br />
Slowly the attendant gazed away from and looked over at me approvingly. &quot;So I&#39;m guessing you tried to take the shoes off her? That was silly...they have a built in defense to that sort of tampering. You&#39;re starting to look pretty good yourself &quot;bro&quot;.&quot; He chuckled softly to himself. <br />
<br />
I gazed over at myself in the mirror confused...and then I gasped. He was right, I hadn&#39;t escaped the changes myself! My t-shirt was no longer hanging off my lanky form. Instead it was pressed tight against my chest which was now much larger. I wasn&#39;t as built as Andy was but I sure didn&#39;t look like a computer nerd anymore. My biceps and legs were thicker too, but I seem to have escaped most of the effects of the shoes. I just looked like I&#39;d suddenly decided to start hitting the gym instead of sitting in front of a computer all day. My hair might have been a shade lighter as well, but it was still brown thankfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well young man, it&#39;ll be $29.99 for the young lady&#39;s shoes.&quot; the store clerk said with a chuckle. &quot;And you&#39;re in luck! You get a free pair with them for your first purchase. I&#39;ve gone ahead and brought them as well. They are a slightly bigger size but I think you&#39;ve seen that&#39;s not a problem. I&#39;ll leave you to change. I&#39;m sure your friend will be willing to help you.&quot; and he chuckled left the room after setting down a pair of flip-flops next to Andy that looked identical except these looked to be about a size 12.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! Awesome! These look great!&quot; Andy was exclaiming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude you don&#39;t...did I just say dude? Anyway, dude you don&#39;t need those shoes. What exactly are they gonna do make you a little bigger?&quot; I was still checking my new body out in the mirror. I wasn&#39;t quite used to it yet. The fabric of the t-shirt was cutting into my underarms and it was a bit uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt the breath get knocked out of me as Andy tackled me to the ground. Even with my new size I was no match for him, he was gigantic compared to me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! You should try em...you&#39;d be sick as my new bro! You&#39;re kinda wimpy lookin right now man.&quot; Andy was saying as he pressed into my back. I could feel his manhood swell against me and it was giving me some intense flashbacks. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No! Dude you can&#39;t!&quot; I was struggling with everything I had but there was just no way I could fight him off. He pinned me with one arm and pulled down my shorts and boxers. &quot;Dude what are you doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you&#39;re gonna struggle...I can make it more enjoyable bro!&quot; he said as he started stroking my cock in his other hand. The pleasure was higher than anything I&#39;d felt before, everything felt warm and amazing to me in that instant. I relaxed and just forgot about anything else and leaned back against the wall as he continued to pump. I failed to notice as he slid my old shoes and socks off with his now free hand (he didn&#39;t need to restrain me anymore) and slipped the flip flops onto my bare feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;There ya go bro! I can&#39;t wait to meet the new you!&quot; Alex was chuckling as I continued to stroke constantly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt a burning sensation in my feet, it was like my orgasm had started early and was located down in my toes. It was an amazing sensation and it just made me stroke harder. I couldn&#39;t stop now...and besides it seemed like I was doomed anyway. I might as well ride this pleasure for all it&#39;s worth!<br />
<br />
My feet started to expand, I could feel as the bones rearranged and grew fitting into the size 12 shoe. Previously they would have hung off my feet but now they were a perfect fit. My body hair started to disappear, falling off in a shower of small brown hairs. Suddenly, just as fast new hairs were appearing on my feet and legs. This time they were blonde in color and much thicker than before. Along with the new hair my calves were starting to tighten and then clench. It felt as though I was exercising them...focusing on those muscles and feeling all the results at once. My calves were blowing up with new muscle, muscle that expanded up suddenly into my quads as the pleasure expanded upwards as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Andy...why. SHIT this feels amazing. I don&#39;t...wanna lose myself thOOughh...fuuuu...&quot; I was trying to say, but a heat in my throat stopped my words from coming out. I felt a horrible pressure in my throat as it expanded out further. I could feel myself groaning as my voice deepened to a guttural bass. <br />
<br />
At this point my muscles were expanding all over my body. I could feel my t-shirt, strained as it was already, ripping and tearing as my new muscles burst out of the clothes. Right as that happened I could see new hair already filling in the space between my pecs, my newly bursting with muscle pectorals. The hair was curling up between them and around my nipples, the blond hairs forming a small forest on my chest while slowly winding their way down my stomach which was tightening into a rugged six pack. As the hair slowly expanded downwards, merging with my groin I could feel my shoulders widening and stretching while my biceps packed on even more muscle.<br />
<br />
As the hair finally connected with my groin, I felt a churning in my balls and felt them slowly growing in size...the average balls I had once held now swelling with testosterone. My dick felt engorged, and I continued to stroke I felt my dick lengthen as well as thicken. My forearms were now swelling with new muscles and a crop of blonde hair popped up there as well as my hands thickened and broadened. I was still too lost in bliss to notice my face losing any softness or roundness. My chin was strengthening as was my jawline and I felt a rough stubble emerge onto my face as I continued to moan in my new bass voice. I saw my hair lengthen somewhat, becoming messy and unkempt. I also saw it lighten up considerably, becoming a honey blonde that looked sexy.<br />
<br />
All this time I&#39;d been looking up at Andy as he watched me change into this new me. And all that time I&#39;d kept my mind...somehow wondering what all of this would do to me. Once the physical changes were over I felt it deep in my mind, tugging away at my conscious thoughts. It was becoming harder to think, I didn&#39;t want to think anymore...thinking was just so hard. The world was fuzzy when I tried to think. If I just acted...just did things that felt good that was ok right? Just did whatever me and my bro Andy wanted to do...<br />
<br />
As I felt the heat all over my body condense into my new balls I felt my mind fading faster and faster. Classes, friends, everything was fading too fast for me to think! All I could see anymore was Andy, the beach, the waves...<br />
<br />
And just like that I came, I felt the heat cascade all over my body and suddenly I blacked out.</p>
