<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After passing out your heard a voice in your head. It is similar to the voice you heard last night before being dropped off in this world &quot;I hope I got the right person. Are you the human who was taken to another reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm ya, that&#39;s me. How exactly do you keep talking to me in my dreams and who are you?&quot; you asked. You had a million questions but it seemed this time you could at least talk to them as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll answer your questions eventually. For now, I gotta tell you a few things my counterpart forgot to tell you. Firstly as you probably noticed there are a few differences between this world and yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya. I&#39;m figuring some of it out as I go but there are a few things I wish I&#39;d have known first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya my counterpart was supposed to debrief you but something happened and he had to be quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
You remembered waking up early this morning and wondered if that had affected it somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably noticed people are very open with sex in this reality. Pretty much any and all kinks are freely shared making rape non-existent and you would be surprised by how much calmer people have been when they can just fuck anytime there are tensions. That has led to fewer wars in the past and none have happened in the last 200 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were shocked by this news. &quot;So history is completely different then I guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes because things have been so peaceful in fact it has led to some changes in scientific discoveries. I believe you already had a run-in with a couple of those. The first one is transformation clothing. They are items of clothes that can change a person to resemble the original owner just by wearing the clothing for a minute. It even affects the mind to give the person basic knowledge and to make them feel comfortable. Most clothes are made out of the fabrics that make this possible.<br />
<br />
I believe you also met a futa. As you know they physically look like girls but have a huge penis and discharge way more than seems possible. They are able to get pregnant and get someone else pregnant and the baby is always a futa as well.<br />
<br />
Both of these things and many others are achieved by the widespread acceptance of genetic engineering and manipulation. Around &#8531; of the population are futas but that is always growing due to most of them having a higher libido and sensitivity due to some kind of genetic manipulation and all of their children also being futas. You probably experienced the higher libido and sensitivity first hand by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya I was surprised since kids in my reality had very little to no sex drive at least not until they are a little older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya most kids in this reality start to experience &#39;heat&#39; at around 6. &#39;Heat&#39; is a time when the libido is through the roof. It makes men produce nearly 10 times as much sperm and women nearly 10 times as likely to get pregnant. Kids can&#39;t get pregnant until they are around 8 so until then they just experience the heightened libido. Heat can last days or sometimes weeks depending on the person.&quot;<br />
<br />
You panicked a bit at hearing that as you were reminded of how much cum was just dumped into you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; the voice reassured &quot;there are loads of free clinics that you can just walk into and have the fertilized egg cells taken out and given to someone else. It&#39;s very common however transformation clothes don&#39;t work while you are pregnant so sooner is better than later. Unless you wanna experience childbirth. If having your womb filled with gallons of cum made you pass out the pleasure from birthing might just kill you&quot; the voice said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;But back to the topic at hand&quot; the voice continued &quot; for the purposes of the experiment we gave you more than enough money to not have to worry no matter what your desire. Oh, and technology is very advanced in other fields. I wish we had more time but it would take hours to explain it all and it appears you are about to wake. One more thing though. Due to the success from just one day my superiors want the test to go a little longer. They said 4 earth years. If I could give you a bit of incentive though if we find your cooperation acceptable we will allow you to pick if you wanna go back to your reality or go to any reality of your choosing when this has finished. So go out and just try to enjoy yourself&quot; the voice finished.<br />
<br />
You woke up as the voice finished. You were in a bed with April behind you with her dick between your thighs and Amber in front humping your hand in your sleep. You noticed something squirming in your pussy. You managed to wiggle free of the cuddle sandwich you were in and stood in the middle of what must be Amber’s bedroom. You looked in the mirror and noticed the panties that were put on you were definitely squirming and when you got a better look you noticed little tentacles that were in your young pussy.<br />
<br />
Your legs felt weak as this was bringing you a huge amount of pleasure and you fell to your knees crying from it feeling so good. You arched your back and squirted over and over. Just as you were feeling like you were going to pass out again the tentacles stopped and you quickly removed the panties. You took a second to catch your breath before standing up.<br />
<br />
Now that your pussy wasn’t being assaulted you found your phone. It was only 10 pm but you figured they must be exhausted. You found that they also took the liberty of putting their numbers into your phone (along with more than a few lewd pictures). You sent them a text ‘hey I borrowed a pair of each of your panties. I hope you don’t mind ;)’ you took the tentacle panties and found the soiled pair of April’s panties then headed out to go to your apartment. You texted your girlfriend ‘hey you still up and want to hang out?’</p>
