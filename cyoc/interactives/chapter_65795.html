<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to try turning yourself into an angel. You've always wanted to fly, anyway. Concentrating, you tried remembering what exactly an angel usually looks like: long, blonde hair, a white robe, sandals, a golden halo right above their heads, and obviously, the white feathered wings they use to fly. You figured that, right now, you could maybe do everything except the halo; maybe you could try that once everything else checks out.<br />
<br />
First off was the clothing; you wanted to make sure your clothing could change as well. Once more, you took your tape recorder and recorded yourself saying, &quot;Your clothing will now change into a simple white robe with a simple sash in the middle; you will also be wearing sandals now.&quot; Before you programmed yourself; you sat in the front of the mirror in order to see if everything went well. Once you were ready, you played the recording while putting yourself in programming mode. <br />
<br />
After a short while, you paid attention to your reflection in the mirror. The shirt and skirt that you had before started to merge together into a single robe, gradually changing into white. Around the torso, the skirt thickened into a belt-like sash. Looking down below, your shoes smoothly changed into a pair of comfy wooden sandals. Your undergarments remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far, so good,&quot; you told yourself as you took a good look at your new clothing. It was rather comfortable, like it was custom-made for your body. You grinned slightly as this proved you could change your clothing as well.<br />
<br />
After a quick rest, you moved on to the next part. Your recording this time was, &quot;your hair will now grow down to near waist-length and change color to blonde; your eye color will also change into sky blue.&quot; You were certain this would work, but you still wanted to see yourself change. This time, instead of your hair shrinking inwards, it grew out to just above your waist. As it grew out, the vibrant pink color changed into a shiny beach-blonde color. As expected, your eyes changed from light green to light blue. Once that was done, you took another look in the mirror, moving your hair around to get a good feel for it. It was quite smooth and straight, like it had been when it was pink. You ended up losing yourself a bit running your fingers through your hair.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, you stood looking at yourself. Now was the tricky part: your wings. After a good long while of thinking about what to do, you sat once more in front of the mirror and recorded yourself, being careful about what you were saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your back will now grow bird-like wings with white feathers, just above your shoulder blades. The wings will grow large enough to wrap yourself with them, and you will be able to fly with them. You will instinctively know how to use the wings, and as they grow, holes will be made in the back of your robe, allowing the wings to fit through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you were allowed to move again, you decided to wait, and you did not have to wait long. In a short while, you started to feel a tingling sensation around your back. A pair of bumps surfaced there and quickly grew. Soon after, the bumps split apart cleanly, revealing a pair of snow-white wings about the same size as bird wings. They quickly started to grow bigger, however. As they grew, a pair of clean cuts were made right in the back of your robe, where the wings fit themselves. It didn't take too long after that before the wings managed to grow as big as your body, and then some. Once they stopped growing, the folded wings managed to reach a few inches above your head.<br />
<br />
Now that that was complete, you stood up and spread your wings. You realized you could not stretch them all the way out, as your room was too small to fit their span, which you guessed to be at least 20 feet, if not bigger. The wings were adorned with the softest feathers you ever felt, with the brightest shade of white. Trying them out, you found out that you could indeed wrap yourself completely with the wings. The muscles within the wings felt firm as well, giving you a good amount of confidence at being able to fly with them.<br />
<br />
You sat down in front of the mirror once more, taking a good look at yourself as your new appendages twitched back and forth. Focusing on yourself, you had to really think about how the next part. Eventually, you decided on what would work and recorded yourself: &quot;You will now spawn a golden halo about the same size as your hand that floats two inches above your head; it will stay there no matter what, and it will glow with a soft golden light.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting there, you waited... until you were assaulted with a massive headache. You closed your eyes while holding your head with your hands, with incredible amounts of pain concentrated on your head, as if something was being forced out of it. It felt like an eternity, but really may have been only a couple of minutes at most. After that, the pain left just as suddenly as it came. You rubbed your head as you finally felt OK opening your eyes again, looking into the mirror.<br />
<br />
It was unexpected, but it was there: a gold ring floating right above your head, bobbing up and down very slightly. It was maybe half an inch thick, with a diameter of several inches, no bigger than your head. There was a soft glow coming from it as if someone had turned a light on inside. Moving your head back and forth, the ring moved along with it. You tried to pull it off, only to find it was stuck there; it wouldn't budge an inch.<br />
<br />
After a while, you stood back up, admiring your reflection in the mirror. You now truly looked the part of an angel. You were now amazed at what your body was truly capable of, and looked forward to seeing what else it could do. However, you also wanted to try out those big wings of yours, since it was pretty certain that you could fly...</p>
