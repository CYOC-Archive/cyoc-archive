<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked in distance as his memories started to alter. He had made sure everything worked perfectly but had forgotten to make himself unaffected by the changes. Jeff thought who was this Jenny anyway? An imaginary girl or an urban legend. There was no girl named Jenny in his class or near the neighbourhood. He couldn&#39;t explain why he had warm pair of girl&#39;s clothes in her room so he rationaled that they must have belonged to someone. But to who? What was the girl&#39;s name again? It started with &#39;Jay&#39; but what was it. Jeff felt embarrased that he had girl&#39;s clothes in his room. He then quickly collected the unknown girl&#39;s clothes into a sports bag and stashed it inside his closet. As Jeff closed the closet&#39;s door he thought that whoever she was mustn&#39;t have been that important to him.<br />
<br />
He shutdown the chronivac for today and went to do something else with his life like getting a girlfriend. Years went by fast and almost five years later Jeff&#39;s mom asked about the old computer he used to play with when he was a kid. Jeff laughed and took it with him to college thinking that it would make a great ice breaker if they want to play some old games. The PC was left collecting dust until Jeff graduated college and went to pursue a business life. Sadly it didn&#39;t last as long as Jeff couldn&#39;t handle his clients and was fired for making too many rookie mistakes. Jeff, now forced to live back his parents house, was settling down at her mother&#39;s basement. She had heard that the old aunt Cassandra had moved to a different city.<br />
<br />
Jeff was now a 27-year-old man who had no better things to do than help her mother with daily chores and work around the house. People  called him as a &#39;mama&#39;s boy&#39; as he started to gain some weight and spent his free time near the computers. Jeff could tell that nobody respected him except his mother and even then she only used him for his muscles. At the age 30 Jeff found his old PC he had played with as a kid and cleaned it back to it&#39;s former glory. Jeff had gained a hefty amount of weight near her gut and had to wear glasses all the time. Jeff had to sit down on his gaming chair as he booted up the PC&#39;s old screen. He saw the old file he hadn&#39;t touched in ages named &#39;Jennifer&#39;.<br />
<br />
A small thought bubble popped inside Jeff&#39;s mind as he remembered a girl like her living near the neighbourhood. He recalled that the old childless aunt Cassandra was her mother but that couldn&#39;t be true. Jeff begun to read her profile and was getting his old memories back of him and Jennifer sitting on his old room. They talked about using the chronivac and...<br />
<br />
A sudden realization hit Jeff&#39;s mind. Had her completely forgot about Jenni? How was that possible. Jeff&#39;s mind raced and his heart pounded as the chronivac revealed that Jennifer hadn&#39;t aged even a day older. Meaning she was still a high schooler and the program considered them a boyfriend and girlfriend like they were in the past. He remembered the conversation they had like it was yesterday. Jeff almost jumped out of his chair as he read it. Putting his face closer to the screen he had to confirm that everything he saw was right. <br />
<br />
At it sure was.<br />
<br />
The moment Jennifer had disappeared. Her body was left in a limbo for a long time. Jeff made an audible gulp as he had a lot to think about. The chronivac was still working like it should, but for how long? The machine made lot of old computer sounds and he wasn&#39;t sure how long it would last. Should he even bring her back or just take a step back and live his life in true ignorance. Could he bare the responsibility knowing that he had forgotten about his girlfriend for this long. How would she even react to him? Jeff rubbed his temples and decided to ...</p>
