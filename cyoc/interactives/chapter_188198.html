<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert sat at the controls of the rented pontoon boat as they headed back toward the dock. The other two guys on the boat where busy looking at their phones, Robert had enforced a no cell phone rule while they were fishing but now that they were heading back he had relaxed his rules. They had caught a few fish but had thrown them back but they had gone through two six packs of beers in the course of three hours between the three of them.<br />
<br />
“We are about done shopping.” Said a female voice through a speaker as Robert looked at one of his friends, Aaron who was face timing with his girlfriend who had gone to the shop to pick up some stuff for them at the house. “We should be back at the house in 20 minutes or so.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, we are about to dock and hang out some more on the beach.” Said Aaron to his girlfriend over face time. “I will see you when you get back my beautiful Princesa Sirena.” <br />
<br />
He blew her a kiss over the phone as the face time call ended. <br />
<br />
“Princesa Serena?” inquired Robert as the boat moved closer to the dock, they where maybe 5 minutes out. “What does that mean?”<br />
<br />
“It’s my nickname for her.” Answered Aaron as he leaned back in one of the deck chairs. His arms behind his back as he grinned to himself. Aaron was a cocky person and he never looked more cocky then he did now. Well that wasn’t fully true, he did generally look more full of himself whenever he had just come back from spending the night with his girlfriend or when his girlfriend left the apartment they shared off campus. <br />
<br />
“It means Princess Mermaid, or mermaid Princess in Spanish.” answered the other guy on the boat in a deep voice. “I heard his girlfriend has a thing for mermaids.”<br />
<br />
“Where did you hear that, Zack?” inquired Robert to the much taller and larger black man who sat on the bench watching the house come ever closer.<br />
<br />
“I walked in on them when they were doing it in our apartment’s hot tub.” answered Zack with a shrug as he looked at Aaron. “They have a mermaid sex toy or it is suit?”<br />
<br />
 Aaron blushed a deep red as Robert and Zack laughed at him, with his a fair skin white kid with long dark brown hair and a medium size build so his blush showed. He gave off a kind of skater kid or base guitar member in some rock band vibe to his look. He did play the guitar so maybe that was what his girlfriend saw in him, Gods know the two of them fucked like rabbits to the point he like so many others were surprised they hadn’t had a kid yet. <br />
<br />
“It isn’t a sex toy.” stated Aaron as he tried to defend himself from his friend’s playful rip on him. “She has one of those mermaid swimsuits.”<br />
<br />
“That you cut a slit in?” offered Robert with a playful laugh.<br />
<br />
“Well at least I have a girlfriend unlike you.” Countered Aaron as Robert lowered his head a bit.<br />
<br />
Robert looked down at his overweight body, he was tall but built like a tank with broad shoulders and the like.  He was fat nearly obese fat, his height and build helped hide some of that but still it didn’t help him. He was a fat nerd who had never been laid in his life. He had very little self-esteem and knew that and talking to people he didn’t already knew scared him to death. He shrugged maybe he wasn’t meant to be with anyone.<br />
<br />
“Dude uncool.” Stated Zack as he glared at his friend and college roommate. Zack had never lacked confidence, he was well built, with rippling muscles and a body to die for. He also had brains having been to college on a full ride with room and board and he was attending grad school in Europe in the fall on a full ride as well. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that.” Apologize Aaron <br />
<br />
“It’s alright.” said Robert with hiding what he really felt. For his part, Robert felt left out, this was basically a couples trip everyone beside him and Amanda had come with their boyfriend or girlfriend. True he could try to get with Amanda but she wouldn’t be interested in him and he knew she was one of those church going abstinence only girls and she was so focused on faith and he didn’t believe. Even so he wasn’t sure if he could work up the nerve to ask her. <br />
<br />
They had to go out to sea a bit to make the turn to the dock easier, when suddenly the outboard motor died. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” inquired Zack as Robert hit the kill switch on the motor and lifted the outboard motor up. It was clear what was wrong, the propeller was covered with seaweed with some kind of thick rope mixed in. <br />
<br />
“We must have driven over a junk.” Stated Robert as he went to work on clearing the propeller of the sea weed and rope. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t going to be a quick fix, the junk had gotten in the way very well.<br />
<br />
After about 10 minutes Aaron spoke up.<br />
<br />
“How much longer?” inquired Aaron<br />
<br />
“This is going to be a little bit, maybe 10 minutes or more.” Announced Robert<br />
<br />
“Shit, I have to take a dump.” Announced Aaron as he looked around, he wasn’t about to take a dump off the side of the boat so close to land and within sight of the house. They where maybe a 100 yards away from the dock, they had swam out this far many times before. <br />
With that in mind, Aaron stripped his shirt and kicked off his shoes and making sure his cellphone was safely in one of the cup holders he headed toward the bow of the boat. <br />
<br />
“Going to swim to the shore.” Announced Aaron as he leapt into the water and diving under for a few moments before reappearing and making for the shore.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I go as well?” inquired Zack as Robert waved it off. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I will be fine, it is more about making sure I don’t damage the dame thing so we get our deposit back.” answered Robert as Zack placed his cell phone down and kicked off his shoes, he was already bare chested and dove gracefully into the water and began to swim toward the shore, none of them knowing that the water was full of their former human friends now merfolk waiting to transform them.</p>
