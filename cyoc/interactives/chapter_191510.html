<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Carmen walked over, he really and truly took in how <i>big</i> this Muscle Tech X stuff made Dillon. The quiet, nerdy and sensitive young man was now an eager, visibly excited muscle man - pleased as could be that his friend came through for him. The way Dillon acted made Carmen wonder if this was a different sort of need. He imagined that growing that big all of a sudden would either hurt or---<i>yeah</i>, as Carmen approached he saw the hard on more or less sticking out of Dillon&#39;s shorts. &quot;Well,&quot; Carmen stated as he walked over, holding the doses one in each hand, &quot;Seems you&#39;re pretty pleased to see this going down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon looked down in time to see his erection sticking up, and he padded it down, suddenly blushing and reminding Carmen of the Dillon that was before, &quot;Ahh...ah, sorry about that!&quot; Dillon covered it as best he could, though the fact he got that excited over it had Carmen wondering about this stuff, &quot;Just...it absolutely does feel that good to grow bigger in such a short period of time. You should really see for yourself sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
An interesting idea, Carmen thought, though he made a mental note that he would only do so after witnessing whatever the doses he had now did to and for Dillon.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really a life saver, man,&quot; Dillon said with a grin, &quot;I needed this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really...?&quot; Carmen asked, looking him over. &quot;You already look plenty big enough. Probably bigger than most of the jocks at school. I mean, Alex probably doesn&#39;t have nearly as good arms as you...&quot; As if on cue, Dillon flexed his biceps with a wink, always eager now to strut his stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dillon nodded, looking over at the trio of Kelly, Tyson and Hans with a rather odd look. As if he was daring them to object to him getting so much. They&#39;d teased him. Teased getting more of this. And now he had it right in front of him, &quot;I want to be as big or bigger than the German guy over there, that Hans Scheier guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a competition bodybuilder, dude, you wanna be that big or...or bigger...?&quot; Carmen wondered what sort of guy Dillon would be when he was done growing. Chances were, the social hierarchy at school would be substantially upended when this big guy swaggered into the grounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean, have you seen the way people look at Hans?&quot; Dillon looked down, and then sighed, &quot;And do you remember the way people looked at me before?&quot; He bitterly reflected on the past, gripping his knee, &quot;Alex and his goon squad all basically using me as target practice whenever I came to school.&quot; Dillon shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;But enough negativity,&quot; the buffed out young man said with a slight smile, &quot;Let&#39;s move forward into the future. Let&#39;s see those doses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmen handed one of them to Dillon, but when the muscle man&#39;s eye drifted to the other, Carmen shook his head, &quot;I want to see for myself what one more dose does to you before I hand you the next one. Just to be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon raised an eyebrow, &quot;...Just to be sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
And then he looked down at the dose. His smile broadened, and once again Dillon felt his erection building. The very idea of just holding one of these now, with the promise of imbibing it, was enough to get him incredibly excited. He still looked over at Kelly and the others. Whereas Hans was offering some workout tips to another gym goer and it seemed Tyson was off heading to the locker room, Kelly was still there. Stop me now, Dillon almost felt like saying. <i>I have it. I have it!</i> He beamed, thinking about her rule. Wondering about it. Wondering if it might be such that no one person would just grab them all up.<br />
<br />
Because honestly with how much this did for him in particular, he wouldn&#39;t have blamed people for grabbing three or even four doses if they thought it would help - this was something that absolutely worked. And worked well. Dillon&#39;s hands shook slightly, though he was very careful not to spill even a drop of the delicious and incredible super-supplement. When he had it at his mouth, his eager cock seemed to bob and a bead of precum stained the seat of his shorts. <i>ohh yes...</i><br />
<br />
Carmen observed from the side as Dillon took it slowly this time. It seemed he was intent on enjoying this. Drinking the dose down and enjoying the taste, feel and texture of the Muscle Tech X as it went down his throat. Carmen wanted to say something, to make some sort of sarcastic remark. Dillon looked like he was in heaven. He wondered if this drink really did feel that good when its effects started their work on someone.<br />
<br />
Dillon finished the dose, thinking mere moments before it took effect, <i>I&#39;m gonna be even bigger than you, Hans. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll beat you on stage at Mr. Olympia...!</i><br />
<br />
And then Dillon felt his whole body shake and begin to pulse, pump and quiver. Muscles that he had already worked that day started to tense and pump up again. If anything could be compared to how the initial dose felt to the young man currently feeling the next&#39;s effects, Dillon could say that the pleasure was even greater on the second dose. His cock in his pants was twitching away, that bead of pre looked a little larger...! &quot;Ooh! Oh! Gotta---Gotta get to the locker room!!&quot; Dillon was suddenly up and running to the locker room. Past Carmen, and right through an open stall door.<br />
<br />
He knew what was coming - heh, coming - and he didn&#39;t want to make too much of a mess on these clothes. Carmen for his part followed, despite knowing full well what Dillon was moving in there for. <br />
<br />
As Dillon gripped the wall right above the toilet, the shorts pulled down, he was not left waiting for very long. He grit his teeth, not wanting to make a spectacle of himself, but even so he let out a few tortured gasps as he felt his orgasm starting to pulse through his body. Yet even as it did so it seemed the sensation brought with it the growth Dillon yet desired. He felt a yearning, a huge sweat coming over him, his brow dripping with perspiration. He watched his tan slightly deepen with enthusiasm...<br />
<br />
Shot one, a pump of white right into the seat of the toilet.<br />
<br />
Dillon felt his pecs, already tense and worked from all the bench press he did that day, start quivering again. His nipples pressed out, and the sudden sensitivity resultant made Dillon gasp and desperately flex, tensing his body, feeling the sensations through his prized pectorals. Ohh, but they stood out so noticeably and sensitively. Dillon languished in this long, full body orgasm, wishing he could just feel it all pump through him at once. He saw how pronounced his pecs were, pushing out so much. Definitely a strong point, he told himself.<br />
<br />
Another shot, this time into the toilet itself. Dillon gasped again as it hit him.<br />
<br />
Dillon felt his thighs and quads pump up, though it seemed this time his thighs were getting the majority of the growth. For whatever reason it seemed he was a thighs guy. Ah well, thick thighs save lives, he told himself. They were becoming really noticeable, enough that it might change the kinds of clothes he wore. <br />
<br />
When Dillon felt his ass growing out more prominent still, toning up and growing into a muscled, tight look, he moaned outright. Not even caring that he was probably able to be heard making that kind of oversexed noise. He blushed and felt it coming again...!<br />
<br />
And shot three - Dillon watched his cock emit it and tilted his head. Dillon usually had a fair bit of body hair. Not nearly as much as the super masculine and impressive jocks, but it seemed as he tried to get a better look that his body hair was thinner. Less of it existed, and what was there was more sparse, lighter, and more short. Dillon wondered in his pleasure filled fugue briefly at the fact, but then just as quickly due to that pleasant distraction he decided it was no problem. Maybe this was just his body telling him that he was going to be doing bodybuilding from hereon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah...&quot; Dillon licked at the air as if he was teasing the wet pussy of that woman who had earlier captured his attention. His figure pulsed, pumped, and a smaller fourth shot hit the inside of the toilet. Still, Dillon grew. He watched his biceps surging, growing right there as he propped himself up against the wall. Those two oh so desired inches he had pined for added themselves on to his arms, all the while his triceps toned up and increased in their own size.<br />
<br />
Dillon&#39;s shoulders, despite him not even moving, broadened enough to necessitate something of a shift in posture. He felt his neck thicken and grow, his features tingling, knowing he was if anything going to be even more devastatingly handsome by the end of this. &quot;Fuck I love this stuff...&quot; Dillon whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
Eagerness rippled through him. He could feel the remaining effects adding those last few touches to his body. Pumping him up toward the level of Hans. A monster of mass, size and tone, though not without a certain element of aesthetics. By the time Dillon felt comfortable moving back, he almost wavered on his still larger feet. He realized as he ambled to and fro that he probably put on another inch or two. He grinned at his hands and pumped an arm as he stood there, getting his bearings, &quot;Ohh yeah, I got my eye on the prize...&quot;<br />
<br />
He even wondered as he stood there if his body could get any better than <i>this</i>. Muscle on top of muscle... He grinned. Always room for improvement, he told himself - remembering that mantra of the massive gym guys who yet chased that elusive &quot;better&quot; year after year. As Dillon walked out, not even bothering with the mess he had made in there due to how distracted he was, he looked down at Carmen.<br />
<br />
Carmen&#39;s eyes were wide as he took in Dillon&#39;s massive body, even bigger than before. It really was true, this stuff absolutely did work wonders on the human body. It defied all scientific sense, and Carmen wondered if there might be some sort of great futuristic science to it or some mystery from the past. But even as he took in the glories of Dillon&#39;s bodybuilder physique, he could see a few things seemed...different in another way.<br />
<br />
Dillon&#39;s exposed midriff showed precious little body hair, and it seemed Dillon was now the kind of guy who never needed to shave. Dillon&#39;s hair seemed thicker than normal and almost longer, with a more pronounced curl to it. Being that Carmen was Greek, he knew the look of an old styled Greek curl to the hair, and Dillon, whitest of whitebread boys, was now sporting a look at almost that kind of curl. Could it be some sort of effect from the Muscle Tech-X?<br />
<br />
What a weird side effect to have!<br />
<br />
And the tan was another thing. Dillon seemed to have out of the blue gotten just the slightest bit more of a tan. Maybe it was just the sudden growth of muscle inducing some sort of reaction in his skin, but it seemed too noticeable in between Dillon on 1 dose and Dillon on 2 to be a coincidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...Well!&quot; Carmen spoke, almost feeling like he couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. &quot;You got even bigger! Holy shit, man. I-I dunno if you&#39;re entirely bigger than Hans, but you&#39;re up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you this stuff worked wonders.&quot; Dillon lazily leaned against the wall of the locker room, smirking. He ran a hand through his hair, enjoying the luscious thickness and length of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am gonna guess,&quot; Carmen said, &quot;That this third dose would well make you even bigger than Hans, and a sure win for at least some bodybuilding competition. You&#39;re...really looking the part. Fuck, man, I&#39;ll be going to school with a bodybuilder...you still down for study, games, and all that stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know it.&quot; Dillon smiled, &quot;Just cuz I got all big and stuff, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t enjoy the things I always enjoyed before. We&#39;re still good to hang out. I&#39;m not about to become some asshole like Alex, cutting ties with friends just cuz he got abs one summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Great to know</i>, Carmen felt a sense of relief. Though he did wonder what this next dose might do to Dillon. The side effects...were these side effects or just how Dillon&#39;s muscles tended to grow? They well, they just seemed minor, but Carmen figured he needed to do some more research. Maybe do some people watching here and see what happened when someone got their hands on more doses still. He was also going to be sure and watch Dillon for any further changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here,&quot; Carmen said as he handed the third dose to a smiling Dillon, who despite his enjoyment didn&#39;t yet take it, &quot;You go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you don&#39;t want it yourself?&quot; Dillon asked, &quot;If you did want it I was gonna say I could part with the third dose to make sure you got your chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Carmen replied, &quot;I&#39;m gonna watch and see how things change from here. I want to make sure this stuff is safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it&#39;s safe as can be,&quot; Dillon said with a shrug, &quot;I mean, I haven&#39;t had any lasting aches, pains, or allergic reactions. I feel great! Could something that makes me look and feel this amazing be bad?&quot; He chuckled and started preening, flexing his biceps openly for the mirror.<br />
<br />
Carmen shook his head, &quot;I just...wanna make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon shook his head, &quot;Whatever you say, man, guess I&#39;m getting more gains.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmen nodded, &quot;And I&#39;m just gonna wait till you&#39;re done outside. I don&#39;t need to hear my friends cum all over themselves like that. A bit too TMI.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, man,&quot; Dillon blushed, &quot;I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll uh, try and keep it down in case I end up dosing around you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Carmen left the locker room, Dillon looked at the dosage resting in the cup. Wondering if he really should. He was already plenty big. He had gotten as big or bigger than Hans in a number of places. He definitely no longer lacked for muscle, though a teasing curiosity nagged at him to go for it. To really see how big he could get. Dillon shook his head, wondering. He wanted Carmen to experience the wonders of this for himself. To see how good it felt to be fucking jacked...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man,&quot; Dillon turned in time to see Tyson standing there. A wry smile on his face. Tyson stated, &quot;You treated me to quite the show, big man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, I&#39;m sorry, I must&#39;ve---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, Muscle Tech-X does that to people. I swear, when we were testing it, this slim and short nerdy guy we were working with...&quot; Tyson related, &quot;He just let it all out, it seemed. Small guy, at the start. But by the end he was a six foot two inch monster...&quot; Tyson chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Dillon went right into one of the only bodybuilder poses he knew - double bicep.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a pretty beautiful body there, big guy,&quot; Tyson said with a smile, &quot;I personally workout for aesthetics, but you&#39;re making all that mass look great on you. You could probably get the attention of a lot of women and men if you wanted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon nodded along - he was personally straight although he didn&#39;t begrudge any guy now the ability to check him out. If anything he found it kind of flattering. It meant he had appeal across the genders. And Tyson it seemed spoke from a position of more than just appreciating his aesthetic and muscular look. Dillon looked at his dose, and then looked at Tyson.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever...&quot; Tyson asked as he cupped his chin, &quot;Contemplated experimenting with the other team? Me personally, I&#39;ve tried it...once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uhh...I think I&#39;m straight.&quot; Dillon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, though I do value the opportunity to see about the possibilities of a little experimentation. Nothing really serious, dude.&quot; Tyson explained his sexual offer, &quot;I mean, I know you just enjoyed yourself quite a bit. How about we just...after you&#39;re done with your workout and or your next dose, we go for some mutually beneficial working off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon actually contemplated that. Experimentation huh...? He looked at his dose, wondering about taking it now, or waiting until his workout was done...or even trying to get Carmen on it. He also found himself thinking a bit further on Tyson&#39;s offer.</p>
