<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Moon Lake Animal Control,” The operator responds; “what is you emergency?”<br />
“Not an emergency,” Eric responding; I&#39;m reporting a successful were hunt.”<br />
There was a short pause before the operator speaks up again. “Is this your first time calling?”<br />
 “Yes,” Eric answering; “My brother gave me the number as he does a fair bit of hunting with his pack.”<br />
“Can I get the animal you took down, where the kill to place and your were-species?”<br />
“It was a four point buck I and my girlfriends claimed,” Eric answering; near around the lake. There was a small clearing were we struck.”<br />
“And your were species?”<br />
“Were-Panther,” Eric answers; “also note that one of my girlfriends is also a were-panther and my other is a werewolf/panther/feline hybrid.”<br />
“Interesting,” the operator remarking; “Mostly it’s the werewolves and were-lions reporting kills. Not often a were-panther goes hunting for fresh game.”<br />
“We were hungry after rutting,” Eric answers.<br />
“Is there any of the animal left?”<br />
“We managed to consume just over fifty percent before feeling full;” Eric answers.<br />
“Very well,” The operator responding; “we will make a note to adjust the population of deer in the area. But please remember, we do encourage catch and release hunting.”<br />
“My brother already mentioned that,” Eric answering; “he is a werewolf and witnessed our kill.”<br />
“Is there anything else you’d like to report?”<br />
“That’s it,” Eric responding.<br />
“Very well,” the operator finishing the call; “thank you for the report and try and have a pleasant night.”<br />
<br />
Eric putting down the phone as he looks at Nate; “I can’t believe it was that simple.”<br />
“All the first timers are surprised,” Nate chuckling getting up from the kitchen table; “I was surprised when I called for the first time reporting a few rabbit kills.”<br />
“I couldn’t believe I wasn’t getting the third degree over killing a buck,” Eric shaking his head.<br />
“You would if it was doe,” Nate looking at the time; “why don’t you join Spencer and Frieda in the basement shower. You don’t want to let that blood on you turn you into the Pink Panther.”<br />
Eric laughs; “And have Peter Seller’s detective Clouseau chase me. Now that would be something.”<br />
<br />
Nate chuckles as he heads upstairs humming the Pink Panther tune as he walks away. Eric grins as he silently walks downstairs to hear Frieda and Spencer giggling while sharing a shower.<br />
“Room for one more,” Eric grinning; “or is this a girl’s only shower going on?”<br />
“Get in here,” Spencer answering; “Frieda and I were trying to decide who gets to scrub your back.”<br />
“Ooooh,” Eric smiles as he enters the shower; the water hitting his blood stained white fur and causing him to feel weighted down as his fur gets wet. “Who gets the honors?”<br />
“I do,” Frieda giggling; “Spencer will be taking care of your front.”<br />
<br />
Eric allows the two eager females to scrub his fur and fondle his body; his arousal showing as his feline member pokes out of his sheathe.<br />
“This could use some cleaning,” Spencer purring as she wraps her lips around Eric shaft.<br />
Eric feeling Spencer’s tongue dance and tickle as he moans in pleasure; “Be sure to save some for Frieda Spencer.” Eric rolling his eyes as Spencer starts sucking hard; encouraging his release.<br />
“Don’t worry Eric” Frieda hugging Eric; “I’m content just to watch you get pleasure. Besides, you and I have tomorrow to enjoy each other before we testify at Julie’s Statue 1A proceedings.”<br />
Eric moans as he feels his orgasm hit; spraying his seed in Spencer’s mouth as she eagerly swallows every drop. Frieda feeling Eric’s and Spencer’s pleasure from their shared link; shuts the shower off as she guides Eric out. Both Spencer and Frieda smiling as they take a towel and furiously dry off Eric and then each other; after drying off Eric gets an ideal in his head.<br />
“Let’s head up to my room and sleep there,” Eric grinning; “my bed might not be big enough for the three of us, but I could lay the blanket down and we could sleep in the floor.”<br />
“As long as you are in the middle,” both Frieda and Spencer coo; “any place is perfect.”<br />
<br />
As the three young weres head upstairs to Eric’s room; Eric can’t help but stare at both Spencer and Frieda’s bellies. Grinning as the raw venison they consumed earlier made the two female were look a couple months pregnant. Placing a paw on each of their stomachs; rubbing it lovingly he whispers as they walk into his room.<br />
“I can’t wait when we are older,” Eric purrs; “that way I can rub these bellies as our cubs grow in them.”<br />
“And feel them respond with your gentle touch,” Frieda purrs; “I can’t wait either.”<br />
“Me neither,” Spencer looking at her figure in Eric’s mirror; imagining herself ten to twelve years from now and married to her white furred Adonis.<br />
<br />
Turning around to see Eric lay a large blanket on the ground and Frieda already lying down, along with Eric; She quickly joins and snuggles next to Eric and Frieda does the same from the other side. All three purring softly as Eric wraps his arms around each of Spencer and Frieda; embracing them lovingly.<br />
“Martha-Maggie Anderson,” Spencer sighs while imaging her full belly with her future first daughter.<br />
“Bethany Anderson-Knight,” Frieda purrs while doing the same.<br />
“It’s nice to know,” Eric kissing his mates; “that we will be proud parents of a litter of cubs years from now.”<br />
“And you their father,” Spencer answering.<br />
“You think we will dream of their birth again,” Frieda asking as she yawns; happy and content to be with her lovers.<br />
“Wouldn’t mind having that dream over and over again,” Spencer yawing; snuggling further next to Eric.<br />
Eric smiles as his eyes slowly close shut; “That would be lovely.”<br />
<br />
As the three drift off to sleep they once again experience the same prophetic dream they had last Saturday evening/Sunday Morning. Eric Anderson; twenty five years old and with his wife Spencer Anderson as she undergoes the rigors of childbirth. Next to Spencer is Frieda Knight; also in labor and about to give birth. With Eric providing moral support to both woman; each scream as their baby’s are born. As a nurse swaddles the screaming newborns and then handing them to the happy mother’s; Tears of joy can be seen from all three. Eric the father of two children is the most thrilled.<br />
“So have we picked out names,” Eric asking both Spencer and Frieda clearly grinning from ear to ear.<br />
&quot;Martha Maggie Anderson,” Spencer looking at her child; giving her daughter her grandmother’s names. Eric agreed the names were fitting.<br />
“Bethany Anderson-Knight,” Frieda speaks as her newborn daughter starts to calm down at her mother’s voice. Since Eric married Spencer; he also loved Frieda. While polygamy was illegal in the state of Washington; Eric and Spencer had an exclusive open marriage with Frieda, who was technically still single. Hence Frieda’s daughter having both her and Eric’s last name, just hyphenated.<br />
<br />
The strange man who visited them the first time after their bond formed smiles as he watches from a distance. “Ask and yee shall receive. Rest well you three; for you will soon have to deal with Julie Stovall who I just might have to talk to and give her a warning to change her ways or suffer. Fret not Frieda, your father has chosen the right path; he will be there to welcome the birth of your daughter. Change is difficult for him, but he is putting in the effort, you just need to meet him halfway. And Spencer; your parents are currently having their own joy. I cannot tell you if the child they are creating will be a brother or a sister; but regardless you will be thrilled with having a sibling.<br />
<br />
While the strange man chose not to intrude on their dreams; Eric, Frieda and Spencer could hear his soothing voice; letting them know all will be well for them.</p>
