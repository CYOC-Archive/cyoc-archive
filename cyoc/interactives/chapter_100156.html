<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The set-up seemed perfect. Ty was reaching into his jacket, made the two pocket-dicks<br />
invisible for everyone in the room except for himself and took them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, boys,&quot; he whispered, &quot;ready to go!&quot; He blinked with his eyes - another methode<br />
to mark the start of his wish, because snipping might have been a bit too obvious in<br />
a place like this - and from now on he could order those pocket-dicks directly via<br />
mind-controle. (Which again raises the question, whether those dicks actually had a<br />
mind to controle?)<br />
<br />
Ty sent the two pocket-dicks over to that woman who was sitting next to the window <br />
with her child. He watched them run over to the table, jumping on the woman&#39;s handbag, <br />
that was on the floor, then next to the stroller and from there up to the table. No one <br />
could see them, except for Ty, who kept them invisible. By command, the two dicks <br />
started to rub each other, until they got all stiff, but they kept rubbing and rubbing, <br />
until they ejaculated shot right up into the air and Ty had to deflect them as to prevent <br />
the woman to be sprayed onto her face. It was far too early for that. Instead Ty made the <br />
ejaculate end up on her cake. But still there was some goo left on the table which was <br />
as invisible to her as the two dicks that were sitting right next to her cup of coffee. <br />
<br />
The woman had gazed out of the window as it all happened and was watching her <br />
child now and then fighting with its chocolate and cake. &quot;Don&#39;t spill your choco!&quot; <br />
she said with a mild and weary smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;You still got yua cek&#39; &quot; the boy replied, stuffing himself with his and trying to give <br />
his mum a chocolatey smile while doing it. Of course he failed to coordinate, smiling, <br />
talking and keeping his cake in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, watch out, your spilling everything.&quot; his mother said, took out a tissue, and <br />
cleaned the boy&#39;s face. &quot;Just be careful with that forke, will you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yua cek, yua cek!&quot; the little one was chanting. &quot;I&#39;ll eat it! Just so you know! You <br />
already had your lot!&quot; and by saying that she picked up her forke and took a first <br />
bit of her cake. Ty could make out the freshly milked goo dripping down from the <br />
cake&#39;s creamy top when she moved it to her mouth. She could not see the ejaculate, <br />
but was it possible that she could eventually smell it? Ty hadn&#39;t thought of that. <br />
The woman was now carefully chewing on her piece of cake and Ty got the impression <br />
that she was intensely considering it&#39;s taste and texture. &quot;Did she spot a difference <br />
to usual cake? But now the kid was drawing her attention away again when it let <br />
got of his forke and the woman bent down and picked it up again, cleaning it with <br />
yet another tissue. <br />
<br />
When she came up from beneath the table she noticed Ty observing her and gave <br />
him an apologetic smile. She was obviously under the impression that her child&#39;s <br />
behavior might have disturbed him and Ty was quick to return a reassuring smile <br />
as if he was just innocently watching a scene between a mother and a child, which <br />
- as a matter of fact - was not so far from the truth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats a cute boy you have there!&quot; Ty said. &quot;Oh well, hes like a bag of flees ...&quot; <br />
she replied. &quot;Did any of the chocolate end up in his stomach or was it all meant <br />
for his face?&quot; Ty said, still smiling at her. &quot;Oh, you can say that again! Sometimes <br />
I think he doesn&#39;t know that he ist supposed to drink it!&quot; She handed the cleaned <br />
forke to her kid who was keenly grabbing it in order to start yet another attack on <br />
his cake. <br />
<br />
His mother picked up her own forke again and cut off another piece of her own <br />
cake, taking another bite. She was obviously enjoying it and besides her not <br />
realyzing that there was jizz on her cake, she looked fresher by the minute. <br />
Those dark shades beneath her eyes, that must have been the effect of raising <br />
a child, probably on her own, having to work and getting up at night then and <br />
again when the boy was demanding it, those shades were slowly vanishing. <br />
Her cheeks were getting a fresh colour and her eyes, that had been appearing <br />
tired all along, were getting fresh and clear now. The small wrinkles that had <br />
surrounded her eyes and forehead, eventually caused by lack of sleep and <br />
concern, were smoothing and after only a couple of minutes she looked fresh <br />
and beautiful again. <br />
<br />
Ty had not foreseen the effect of those pocket-dicks ejaculate. He had not even <br />
planned it all through, but when he saw what effect it had on that woman he <br />
was glad and decided to leave it at that. He would not tease her any more. <br />
He summoned his pocket-dicks to return to his table and thought about his next <br />
move.</p>
