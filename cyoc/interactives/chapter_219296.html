<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After cleaning yourself up, taking care of a few other quick chores around the house, and studying the instruction manual some more while you waited for the clock to near the time specified by your new girlfriend Kimberly, you now find yourself standing in front of Kim&#39;s shared house. You kept the glasses carefully hidden in your shirt&#39;s breast pocket, after all you weren&#39;t quite done with them just yet.<br />
Ringing the doorbell, you hear someone yell &quot;Coming!&quot; before the door is abruptly opened by a short and curvy latina gal. She was all smiles as she greeted you warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! Come in, come in! You&#39;re right on time!&quot; said the girl. She wore a red loose floral shirt that exposed her right shoulder and black denim pants. Her wavy brown hair was tied up in a loose braid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, hi...&quot; you wave a bit awkwardly, before she grabs your arm and pulls you indoors.  &quot;Um, I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met?&quot; If you recalled correctly, there were four young college students sharing the house, and you don&#39;t remember seeing her before.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Maria, chico. I recently came  here from Spain to study.&quot; she explained as she brought you to the living room. &quot;Go on inside, I just need to help with the snacks.&quot; the latina shortstack said before entering a side room you assumed was the kitchen. Kimberly was there in the living room, chatting with an asian girl you recognized as Chloe. She was a bespectacled waifish lady of Asian descent, and she looked all the more tinier next to Kim, the hippo woman smiling warmly when you walked in and greeting you with a peck on your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you could make it, hun.&quot; She said quietly, and you gave her a nod and a thumbs-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah no, wasn&#39;t gonna miss this for anything else, Kim.&quot; She giggled at your response, and then plopped her massive rear on a three-seater couch, the cushions visibly sagging beneath her weight. You made to sit next to her but Chloe stopped you, hands resting firmly on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, before you get all comfy-cozy with my bestie... where&#39;s your contribution?&quot; She asked, looking you square in the eye, much to your confusion. Kim rolled her eyes and was about to complain, but the petite girl wasn&#39;t having it. &quot;We have a rule here: for movie night, everyone pitches in with the snacks!&quot; You were about to retort, but someone spoke up before you could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, chill. He&#39;s new to this, we can let him off the hook this once.&quot; Said a young red-haired woman with shoulder-length wavy hair, her green eyes full of mirth. If you recalled, this was... Olga? No, wait, Helga. Right. She entered the living room holding a tray with bowls of potato chips, nachos, and some other snacks, and following her was another young woman, a chubby indian gal named Shanti, you recall having met her in the gaming aisle at the local supermarket. She too carried a tray with bowls of popcorn.<br />
The two greet you and place the trays on the low table in front of the couches, with Helga promptly walking up to Chloe and pulling her to the two-seater couch, winking at you in an apologetic tone. &quot;Sorry bud, my little Chloe always gets a bit snippy when she&#39;s hungry, don&#39;t mind her.&quot; Chloe just pouts and huffs, but it was clear that she was enjoying Helga&#39;s embrace. So they were in a relationship, huh? Interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, chicas and chico, we all ready to watch the movie?&quot; Maria asked loudly, reentering the room with a platter full of quesadillas. You cleared your throat, and all eyes were on you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, question. What are we watching? Kim kinda neglected to tell me the name of the film.&quot; There was a bit of an awkward pause in the room as you just stood there, unsure of yourself, while Helga and Chloe giggled and Shanti started the DVD player.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, it&#39;s not some dumb romcom, it&#39;s a classic: &#39;The Dame of the Rose&#39;, with Shaun Connely and John Kurt.&quot; The hippo woman snorted, leaning back into the couch and making her grey fatty skin wobble a bit.<br />
<br />
With a smile, you nod and excuse yourself, briefly asking where the toilet was and heading there. You were fortunate, that the bathroom happened to be out of sight of rhe living room: all you had to do was merely flip the lights on, and open and close the door to give the impression that you were using the bathroom as you told them you intended to. Hugging the wall, you peek at the girls sitting on the couches: Kim sat in the middle of the three-seat sofa, flanked on both sides by Shanti and Maria, the other two being pulled towards the much-heavier Kim. Meanwhile Helga and Chloe sat comfortably on the two-seater, their slender and lithe figures leaving plenty of space in the couch for at least two more people as they cuddled together.<br />
It was time to change all that, and give Kimberly some true bosom buddies...<br />
You crank the weight dial up a couple of notches, and slip the glasses on, looking at Helga and Chloe, and in an instant the two ladies have turned into two very corpulent hippos, even larger than Kimberly. Helga possessed quite the hourglass figure, with her  formerly modest tank top now being nothing more than a makeshift bra that failed to contain her massive bosom, with plenty of cleavage and underboob exposed. Similarly her boxer shorts looked like they were a few jiggles away from tearing apart on her meaty thighs. Chloe on the other hand was an absolute butterball of a hippo, with her belly being her most prominent feature. It was so big, it completely covered her lap and she could easily rest her laptop on it. Her breasts were also big, too, just not like Kim&#39;s or Helga&#39;s.<br />
Their swollen figures deformed a bit as they snuggled on the couch, and as like Kimberly before, their heights also shot up, too, likely as tall as she was, perhaps an inch or so taller, maybe? Hard to tell like this.<br />
<br />
You quickly take off the glasses and turn the weight dial back a bit, if only to have a little mercy on the three-seater sofa the other three women sat on. The girls remained oblivious to the changes, blissfully chatting and waiting for the movie to load, as you had made it so that they and the whole world believed they had always been huge hippos their whole lives. Only you knew the truth.<br />
<br />
Placing the glasses on once more, you peek at the trio of women, and lo and behold, now Maria and Jennifer were hippos, as well. They pressed their chunky bodies together with Kimberly, cuddling and sandwiching her, given the utter lack of room on the furniture, and even though they were thinner than Kimberly, the pair were still huge compared to their former human selves. Jennifer was a pear, with most of her weight placed on her lower body. She had a bit of a belly and bust, sure, but it was very clear where the fat would gather. Maria, while still being the shortest one of the gang, would still loom over you at around 7&#39;1, you estimated. Her figure was similar to Helga&#39;s hourglass body, albeit a bit thinner.<br />
<br />
Pleased by your handiwork, you tucked the glasses back into your shirt pocket and quietly entered the bathroom to... calm yourself. Yeah. You were pretty sure the tent you were pitching in your pants would be a major distraction from the movie the girls needed to watch, so you flushed the toilet to create some noise, took a few deep breaths, browsed your phone for something random or funny to relax and dial back the horny.<br />
<br />
Having accomplished that, you exit the bathroom, and rejoin the girls. They visibly perk up when you&#39;re inside their visual range, with Maria excitedly waving you towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there you are, niño. Come come, sit here!&quot; And she pats the small space between her thighs, which wasn&#39;t that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh, he&#39;s supposed to sit with us!&quot; Chloe imposes with a pout. She was still wearing her own glasses, their design changing to fit the width of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies... we could always let him decide where he wants to sit.&quot; Shanti mumbled quietly, with Kim and Helga aggreeing. Once again, all eyes are on you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hun? Who do you wanna sit with?&quot; Kim asked sweetly, batting her long eyelashes at you in a suggestive manner.<br />
<br />
You decide to...</p>
