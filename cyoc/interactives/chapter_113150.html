<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How are we going to have a girl’s night out,” Ester sipping some tea in the Knight Estate kitchen; “while I have three children that need constant supervision? And my husband,” Ester growling; “being passed out drunk in his fursona, doesn’t exactly help.”<br />
“Frieda,” Amanda sighs; “I call her up and ask for a favor.”<br />
“Where is your daughter,” Ester asking; “with Eric?”<br />
“And Spencer,” Amanda putting her tea down; “I’ll call up my daughter while you take the town car to pick up Lila and your children and bring them back here.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Spencer was purring happily as she as basking in the warm pleasant sensation of being filled by Eric moments ago. Lying on the thick carpet, her green eyes fluttering as she hears Frieda yowling as Eric’s barbed penis digs into her feminine folds. Knowing they are next to her, Spencer can’t help but smile as enjoys the moment.<br />
<br />
Mounted on top of Frieda, Eric was vigorously thrusting as eagerly probed the warm and familiar canal of the were-panthress he was rutting. After becoming a white furred were-panther, at the paws of the eager female below him; Eric was happy. Since moving to Moon Lake with his parents, the shy bookish young kid had a failed romance with a wer-mer that turned bitter. A girlfriend that had a past relationship trying to rear its ugly head; and then Frieda stumbled into his and Spencer’s lives. A former friend of Julie Stovall; the were-panthress quickly developed a fast friendship with, at the time the still human boy and female hybrid he fell in love with.<br />
<br />
With her help, Eric and Spencer were finally able to consummate their love with each other, but not before developing true feelings of love for the two. With Julie now unable to stop the three from being together and their parent’s blessings; Eric, Spencer and Frieda eventually consummated their own love for each other in the form of a bond so deep, it could only be described as love in its purest form. An emotional connection trying the three to each other; able to sense the other’s feelings and either feed off of it enhancing their own passion and pleasure, or helping to calm the other down in times of distress. The other noticeable change was their eyes changing into the intense shade of green the three have in and out of their fursonas.<br />
<br />
While there was another added benefit; their mingling scents during sex acting as an aphrodisiac that is irresistible to other weres; Their parents, most notably Frieda’s have done everything they could to stem the smell of the three’s rutting from driving them and everyone else mad with wanton lust. Yet it was the shared orgasms each other felt during their climaxing that helped further cement their bond. Able to feel and experience the other’s orgasm as if it was their own, was an intense sensation to have. More so for Eric; feeling the full body rush of both Frieda’s and Spencer’s orgasms made sure his own orgasm was far more intense. As such so was Frieda’s and Spencer’s when they felt his course through them and each other’s.<br />
<br />
Yet it was the one final feature of their unique bond. A special ability the three have chosen to keep to themselves; not even their friends and parents know this unique sensation. Thanks to their bond; for brief moments, primarily during the throes of passion; Eric, Spencer and Frieda briefly see what he other sees through their eyes as if it were their own. Such as the case currently happening in the Anderson rec room.<br />
<br />
Frieda yowling as Eric’s barbs flex and dig in; She feels him explode and fill her eager womb with his seed. Panting as her own body reacts and lets loose with her own orgasmic release; her eyes flutter as she gets flashes of seeing her own backside as if she was looking through Eric’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Ooooooh,” Frieda moaning; unable to form words but clearly finding the moment enjoyable as she starts up a low rumble that turns into purring.<br />
“It’s a shame we can’t be out in our fursonas outside,” Eric still mounted in inside Frieda; “that dammed were-alert is going to make the next few days unbearable.”<br />
“You’ve gotten used to having a hunt after sex,” Spencer speaking; “haven’t you Eric.”<br />
“Can’t deny that chasing down an elk or a deer,” Eric growling happily; “is just as fulfilling as rutting you two into exhaustion.”<br />
 “It does help sate our appetites,” Frieda finally coming down from her orgasmic rush; “when our bellies are full of fresh game. I swear,” Frieda sighing as she feels Eric’s member flex and twitch; “I’ve eaten more rabbit and venison in the past year than my parents have in their entire lives.”<br />
“I can believe that,” Eric caressing Frieda as he waits for his member to slowly slide out; both girls finding the sensation of his erection deflating and retreating out of their sex pleasurable in its self. Hearing Frieda wince and sigh as his barbs still dug into her slick sensitive canal slowly drag along as his feline member slowly retreats back into his sheathe.<br />
<br />
“I want another round,” Spencer getting up; “but I want both of you my mates, to pleasure me.”<br />
<br />
Spencer uttering the word mate was like a primal trigger for Eric; causing his member to quickly re-inflate causing Frieda to gasp as she feels filled up once again. Yet Eric was unable to start up again when Frieda’s cell phone starts ringing. Growling at the unwanted interruption as he is forced to get up and allow Frieda to answer it. Eric pulling out of Frieda caused the grey furred were-panthress with russet highlights to yowl in pain; Eric could only shrug in a feeble attempt at an apology. Both knew his feline like member hard barbs on it that are designed to stimulate a female to ovulate during sex; fortunately, with both girls keeping up and at times doubling up on their were-birth control pills, neither was going to be with child anytime soon.<br />
<br />
“It’s mom,” Frieda looking at the caller I.D; “I better answer this. Hello Mom, I’m still at Eric’s.”<br />
“Sorry for interrupting,” Amanda pausing; “whatever it is you three are doing, but can you do me a favor?”<br />
“What is it,” Frieda asking.<br />
<br />
Amanda quickly fills Frieda in on what has happen in regards to her father and uncle. Detailing that the two were-panthers decided to go and get drunk after working on preparing a nursery for when Lila eventually gives birth. Finding out that Lila’s brother Rick was also blitzed, meant one thing.<br />
“Frieda,” Amanda speaking; “you think you can mind Ester’s children over here, while we ladies go out for the evening?”<br />
“As long as Eric and Spencer are helping,” Frieda answering; “Cindy, Jasper and Yogi are a paw full.”<br />
“As long as you three are keeping an eye on them and not on each other’s… assets,” Amanda inhaling deeply; “just be here in a half hour.”<br />
<br />
Frieda disconnects the call and looks at her mates, Spencer and Eric. “You heard didn’t you.”<br />
“These ears,” Eric flexing his ears on the top of his furry head; “are not just for show.”<br />
“But I’m not fully satisfied,” Spencer grumbling; “can’t we have a quickie before we go?”<br />
“No,” Frieda sighing; “the way we go at, it would take thirty minutes just for Eric to finish emptying his balls into you.”<br />
“That long,” Eric looking shocked; “I thought I was quicker.”<br />
“At first you were,” Spencer smiling; “but with all our rutting, you have-“<br />
“Gained quiet the staying power and stamina,” Frieda smiling as she finishes Spencer&#39;s comment; “now let’s de-fur and get dressed. We have were-tigers cubs to run us ragged.”</p>
