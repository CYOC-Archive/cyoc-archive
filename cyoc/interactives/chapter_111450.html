<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Asked to sit, she sat on what was the bed there in the prison cell. Although she acted as if wanting to be friendly, her manners of how she sat made her host feel a good bit apprehensive. Indeed she was part female Mule animal, as her entire body, from the shoulders down to her feet she had the blackened hide of a Mule animal and the fur similar to that of a horse. She had a well set Mule&#39;s tail she would often toy with, letting it swing, swish or sway. Her legs were those like a Mule would have, and she had hocks not heels, and feet ending in a single, solid toe hoof like those on a Mule animal.<br />
<br />
She was ever so sleek her body, having lovely if furred human breasts, the nipples looked as puckered and constantly in a state of being aroused. As might a jennet Mule she failed to have an udder and two teats where a Mule would, but had there her fur surrounded black colored skin labia. As of women seen before being naked, this, her labia was larger as well the outer lips being smooth. She did at varied times as she spoke her labia lips did wink like what a mare does when she is in estrus and feeling her need to being bred.<br />
<br />
As she began to tell of her being arrested and then imprisoned for something as minor as Jaywalking, the crossing of a street corner subverting the use of the marked crosswalks. Such an infraction of the law is but a misdemeanor, and never should have warranted her being put in jail or the worse, sent to this rabid sort of a penitentiary prison. <br />
<br />
It so happened that she noted her prison cell host male as closely eyeing her labia, she sitting there while allowing her equine like legs to fall away from the other, gifting a fuller view of her sex. She took the manner of how her host was looking at her, he was licking his dry lips as if in some anticipation of him wanting her as his partner in some lurid sexual play. She then rose up from off the cell cot and stood bearing her black equine like labia as it to the nose of her cellmate and host.<br />
<br />
Her scent was of a spiced fragrance, somewhat musky, very alluring. She stood there doing what she was taught to do, not that maybe she wished to dooming damn another man to become a Mule-human like her, and with the passing of time then be changed further to become as is a male Mule, and sold as a beast of burden. <br />
<br />
She might be offering a man his one way to gain his release from having to live in this hell-hole of a prison. As if and when someone being infected by such a female or a male Mule-human, and became of similar, as after a final inoculation with some serum you became then a Mule animal, there was then a sense of freedom won when taken from the prison to live of life on a farm.<br />
<br />
Although being new to prison lifestyle the thought of personally damning one&#39;s self at that point in time seemed as foolishly ambiguous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dear for the close-up view of where most men would relish going to enrich their sexual promiscuity, however I like being what I am as a whole human male. I do thank you for suggesting to me what I might in time decide is a better way to be as live, if after gaining more experience living inside this prison I want to do what you so friendly offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, and she began to cry.<br />
<br />
Weeping and asking of forgiveness from her prison cell host, she slumped back to again sitting, she leaning back on the cot with one of her hind like legs laid across the end of the cot. She went on blubbering through her tears about how the prison warden and one of his lieutenant guards literally owned her, as told her of who they wished to become as infected.  She was given a quota to produce strong male Mule-men that after a month of their enduring changing they were inoculated and placed into solitary while enduring their worst time of drastic transforming. She was allowed to see a few of those she had doomed after they stood on all fours, as male Mules, as then castrated and wearing work harness, they usually paid her their tribute by licking of her aroused weeping pussy.<br />
<br />
It happened then that in her highly volatile state she took to fingering her labia, poking in two fingers and stirring them around, she masturbating herself. <br />
<br />
Watching from across the jail cell, seeing the thick coating of her vaginal discharge clinging to her fingers, as knowing that form it if somehow she were to touch a mouth and infect her quarry, another kindly man would be doomed to living a lifetime of harsh treatment and equally hard work.</p>
