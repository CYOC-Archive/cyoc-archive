<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before you reached school, Willow took a hard turn and pulled into a nearby parking lot all of a sudden. You were about to ask her what was up when you noticed that she was currently experiencing extreme discomfort. Her face was scrunched and her back was arched forward she quickly pulled off her top and you watched as 2 sets of translucent white wings pushed out of her shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
Willow was not an elf, but a fairy!<br />
<br />
It was then you felt an intense burning sensation in the small of your back and in your hips. It felt like your skin was melting and tearing as you bent forward in agony. You opened the car door and fell out onto the ground in pain as 2 massive jet black wings pushed out of you. Unlike Willows though, yours were solid in their coloration and made up of feathers. You also could be rotate them forwards so that they were more horizontally level than up and down. While you were still on the ground, your face began to be pushed up off of the pavement as a set of curved horns pushed out and up from the sides of your forhead and angled backwards. Finally your spine shot down and out of the small of your back, right between the points where your wings attached. Your skin and muscles followed wrapping around the growth forming your new tail. Lastly your eyes turned a glowing bright red before fading into a non-glowing, dark magenta color.<br />
<br />
And as quickly as it came, the pain was gone. You sit up and look around, before slowly getting up onto your feet. You nearly stumble forwards as you realize that you cant bend your ankles more than a bit, forcing you onto your toes. You could not place your heels down on the ground, making you stand flat footed, no mater how hard you tried to do so. Your body just physically couldn&#39;t bend your ankles like that anymore. But on the other hand, you were perfectly comfortable walking on the tips of your toes like it was no big deal. This likely means that you will need something like a minimum a 4&quot; heel or taller shoe from now on. <br />
<br />
You look back to the car and see Willow looking at herself in the overhead mirror. She looked more or less still the same, just was spewing a glittery dust-like powder everywhere that thankfully disappeared after a few seconds, from her wings with each and every single one of their movements. <br />
<br />
You start walking over towards the car as durring your transformation, you had apparently moved quite a distance aways from the car. As you move you notice that every movement of your body is done in a slightly seductive manner. Be it how you are swaying your hips, or crossing over your legs with each step, or even how your upper body&#39;s posture has completely changed, giving you an almost permanent slight arch to your back which puts just a bit more emphasizes on your breasts than usual. <br />
<br />
By the time you make it back to the car, you realize that there is no possible way you will be able to fit inside it with your new wings. Willow barely can since she put her seat back into an almost fully reclined position, but yours are just simply too massive compared to her&#39;s. At least school was literally only a few hundred feet from where you were currentlty.<br />
<br />
You are standing up against the car and absentmindedly fold your arms underneath your breasts, pushing them both up and together slightly as you lean down to look into the car. &quot;So what the hell happened to us?&quot; You ask while not meaning to, but somehow saying it in a breathy, seductive manner. Willow breaks out of her apparent trance of looking at herself to finally notice you standing there. &quot;OMG like holy shit! Gwen, is that you? You are looking like, super hot right now. Your tits are looking AMAZING!&quot; She says, while singing the last word. Then puts her hands over her own mouth in complete shock. &quot;Like OMG, why am I speaking like some ditzy bimbo? Like, why can I like, not stop myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
You chuckle at her altered speech patterns, not yet realizing you were also changed in a similar manner too. &quot;Thanks, and I ageee that they are quite an amazing pair of tits. Wanna touch them? Since you are cute, I am willing to let you feel them up for a bit.&quot; You say, leaning over further, giving Willow the full view of your cleavage for several seconds before you snap back to being in full control and pull yourself away from the car, while trying to hide your breasts and cleavage better with what little extra fabric you had to work with. &quot;Sorry, please ignore that last statement I made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems that our speech is like, being messed with or something. This is gonna be like, so fucking annoying if I have to speak like some kind of bimbo. I like, so can&#39;t even. This is like, so totally bullshit. At least you can speak like, somewhat normally. Ugh, this like, so fucking sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
You move back over to the car, this time next to the driver side and bend over again, placing one hand on your knees and using the index finger of the other to lift up Willow&#39;s chin and point it towards you. Your faces are mear inches apart and you are grinning seductively as your eyes flash a glowing red for a moment. Next thing you know is you are down on your back with Willow on top of you pushing you down while making out with you.she is floating in the air with her wings flapping rapidly. Then suddenly she stops and falls out of the sky onto you. She is looking around confused. &quot;Like what the fuck? Why am I like, out here? Gwen, what the shit did you like, do to me? My mind is like, so fuzzy right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have accidentally charmed you just now. But, if you want to continue where we left off, I don&#39;t mind giving you a little refresher of what you don&#39;t remember&quot; you say now crawling over towards Willow who is sitting on the ground. She closes her eyes and stands up. &quot;No. We need to like, seriously focus here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I think we can do both. You focus on whats happening to us while I eat out that soaked little pussy of yours. Or would you rather swap roles?&quot; You ask, as you can&#39;t stop yourself from speaking like this at the moment. And to your surprise, Willow even goes along with your suggestion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d rather just lick your pussy and let you do like, all of the thinking.&quot; She says as she places her head inbetween your legs and starts going to town on your pussy. You begin petting and rubbing her head with encouragement while you collect your thoughts about the recent events. <br />
<br />
Somehow, you have turned into a succubus and Willow has become a fairy. You both are experiencing mentality shifts as well as some forced actions and personalities, especially with how you both speak. It also seems something else is at play here, some kind of magic perhapse, because Willow definitely was floating just a bit ago, and you somehow charmed her instantly with just a look into her eyes. You also can likely fly too. But as to why this is happening, neither of you know the answer. Hell, no one seems to.</p>
