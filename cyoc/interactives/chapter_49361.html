<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know Kaylee, when I do this with your parents, I think I'll make them a year or two <br />
younger, that is, younger than my parents are -now- of course...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That great Master! You guys hear that? You're going to be so cute!&quot; Kaylee giggled in her <br />
parents ears. The still human Perkins felt sick to their stomaches. In all the tales and <br />
rumors about The Game, none of them had anyone use it in such a, infectious way before, <br />
plenty of course had used it for personal gain or personal grudges, but, he couldn't recall <br />
any story about anyone using the game like this! <br />
<br />
&quot;Be quiet Kaylee, I'm not missing anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee almost said 'yes master' but thought better of it. <br />
<br />
So Kaylee thought instead of her earlier suggestion to get ride of the doors, 'It's not like <br />
any of us have a sense of modesty or privacy, and the doors can block our sense of smell <br />
and sound some. And most of the door frames are a little too small for us anyway and <br />
decidedly too small for Master anyway. And I'm betting everyone who works and lives here <br />
will be Transformed or Dared soon enough.' <br />
<br />
Kaylee took notice of the reddish brown fur that matched her own on Bart, and the black <br />
fur on Jennifer The First that matched her Master's. 'Hmmm, are they become -our- cubs? <br />
Or are they just changing to match the pack? There was nothing in the transform about <br />
that, was there?' Kaylee wanted to bring this up, but again didn't want to distract her <br />
Master. <br />
<br />
Making sure his parents eyes were on him, Jensen with one big arm tossed their bundle of <br />
clothes into a waiting waste basket.  &quot;You won't be needing those ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
The humiliation, vulnerability, and unfairness of their situation proved to be too much as <br />
the two exposed nine year olds covered in fur began to sniffle the details of the transform <br />
had flown over their heads and frightening imagery began to fill their now active <br />
imagination. <br />
<br />
Jensen was slightly regretful that the twins would take a while to completely dismantle the <br />
two cars and couldn't join him and his mate. He was sure that they would have enjoyed <br />
the show. But a stitch in time saves nine, and the sooner the biggest pieces of traceable <br />
evidence were gone the better for himself and his pack. Not that he had any clue how <br />
much time it actually took to dismantle a couple of cars. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're bad!&quot; Jennifer shouted, and covered her mouth, now a muzzle, he had wanted to <br />
say something a lot worse to her child, mostly along the lines of telling him how much of <br />
a total spoiled brat she/he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Big and Bad, Jenny.&quot; Jensen nodded. <br />
<br />
The semi-wolf nine year holds covered their heads as the ears on the sides of their head <br />
vanished and new triangular one popped up on the top of their heads. The changes in <br />
sounds disoriented the two, a few seconds later their muzzles completed and a whole new <br />
world of smells hammered through their heads causing them to fall on their heads which <br />
cause them to yelp and stand up quickly as their fluffy black and reddish tails had <br />
completed their growths. <br />
<br />
Jennifer I was scared that she'd be soon seeing the world in blacks and whites but her <br />
vision remained apparently the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm beginning to wonder if I should have gotten camcorder, then again I wouldn't want a <br />
tape to fall into the wrong hands before they became paws.&quot; Jensen giggled at his own <br />
words. <br />
<br />
Bartholomew and Jennifer I looked at their little hands, now covered in black or reddish <br />
fur with claws, the insides of their hands were now covered with callous, they tested their <br />
altered digits morbidly.  Their hair became much shorter, until in Bartholomew's case it <br />
left him 'bald' with only the fur on top of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya gotta stop it! Ya gotta! Ya gotta!&quot; Bartholomew tried desperately one last time actually <br />
stomping his paws. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there's nothing I could do if I wanted.&quot; Jensen said his smile never leaving as he held <br />
up a paw to his own muzzle gentleman like, &quot;Once a Dare or Transform has been spoken, <br />
it can't be taken back. Ask Kaylee, she knows best, she was the one whose lame brain idea <br />
as Kyle that gave me the new big bad me! I repaid her in kind soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee herself smiled at the memory of earlier today, her biggest screw up as Kyle had <br />
resulted in the best thing had ever happened to her. <br />
<br />
Bartholomew and Jennifer I looked at each other in the eyes fearfully, as looked as their <br />
eyes changed twisting into something that was no longer human. Both realized fearfully, <br />
besides the length of their fingers and the addition of a thumb, plus the position of their <br />
spines that had them stand up on two legs and face foreword, there was nothing really <br />
human about either of them. They looked more like cubs of a species of wolf that had <br />
become tool users much like some apes had millions of year ago. <br />
<br />
Both hugged themselves inches away from each other and moaned once more as their <br />
muscle mass increased, staying nine year olds, but having the muscular of a knight's page. <br />
The hunched foreword ever so slightly. <br />
<br />
Jensen figured at this point their physical changes were round about done, which meant it <br />
was time for the rest of them to be rewired. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now both of you stand up straight and side by side.&quot; Jensen said, they obeyed but he saw <br />
the fear in their eyes. This just meant he got to toy with them a tiny bit more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now how old are you both?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forty!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty eight and a half!&quot; Jennifer again started at her own answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh-uh!&quot; Said Jensen waving a claw. &quot;Do you LOOK that old? Tell the truth now.&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked at each other and bowed their heads, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Not really.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now how old do you look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine.&quot; &quot;Nine and a half... okay nine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now how old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked unsure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NINE!&quot; They yelped together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what was that answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine.&quot; &quot;Nine.&quot; They said more relaxed this time, the looks in their eyes spoke of utter <br />
defeat. If they weren't going to squirm anymore, then that was that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now answer each question as fast you can. What are your favorite things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spiders.&quot; &quot;Flowers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine.&quot; &quot;Nine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolfies.&quot; &quot;Puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your social security numbers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;555-650-001.&quot; &quot;555-499-002.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine!&quot; &quot;Nine!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's your favorite food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ham.&quot; &quot;Deer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;how old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NINE!&quot; &quot;NINE!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are your PIN Numbers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;1929.&quot; &quot;1777, and really ya know the N in PIN stands for Number so really-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;-How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
They look at each other and shrugged, &quot;Nine.&quot; &quot;Nine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are your names?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bart.&quot; &quot;Jenny.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; &quot;Nu-uh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What were your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bartholomew Benedict Smith, blagh!&quot; Bart rolled out at his tongue in disgust at the name. <br />
&quot;Jennifer Elizabeth Smith The First.&quot; Jenny giggled like it was a game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you work for, who do you love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pack.&quot; &quot;Our pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is your pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart crossed his arms in a know it all manner, &quot;The Big Bad Wolf Pack!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're our pack!&quot; Cheered Jenny at Jensen and Kaylee. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's your education Bart?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart cross his arms again and this time his legs too with a 'smart yet cool guy' self <br />
confident look on his face, &quot;Master's Degree in Business an' Economics.&quot; He said with a <br />
drop of arrogance. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you and Bart going to do Jenny?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Gonna make sure dis' place stays up and runnin' for ya and the rest of da pack!&quot; Jenny <br />
said smiling with her muzzle showing lots of fangs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything you want to do with those?&quot; Jensen pointed at the clothes in the waste <br />
basket. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny instantly went over to the waste basket, and tore the expensive pants and <br />
jackets to shreds and calmly retrieved a couple set of keys a remote and a pair of wallets <br />
then tossed the rest back in the garbage, putting the said items on the desk. Jensen made <br />
a note that those clothes would have to go in the fireplace and not in the garbage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw.&quot; Bart shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; Jenny answered. <br />
<br />
Jensen looked gleefully at the two new naked wolf cubs. Then he looked at the the still <br />
human Perkins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, Bart, it's time for you to play a little game with the two humans who butted into <br />
our pack's home.&quot; 'Not that they'll have a choice what to answer due to the Dare.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; &quot;Cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen remembered his previous error.  &quot;Actually just Bart, Jenny you can come here and sit <br />
on my lap and watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Jenny nodded the wolf cub climbing into the towering wolf beast's lap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Bart  come here and I'll tell you what to tell the two humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whao' kay.&quot; Bart nodded and brought up an ear to Jesen's muzzle as he spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you guys excited?&quot; Kaylee said to her parents hugging them as she continued to <br />
weight them down.  Both human beings still felt sick to their stomachs at the imagery <br />
playing out before them. &quot;You're gonna be part of the pack in no time!&quot;</p>
