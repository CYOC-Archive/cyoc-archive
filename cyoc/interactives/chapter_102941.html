<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Tell me you said no. Don’t lie to me. Tell me you said NO,” demanded Nate Anderson.<br />
He told Kenya Adaeze not to lie, so she couldn’t tell him that because she said she’d think about it.<br />
Did she do it just to be polite? Did she intend to tell Jack Ashford no? Or was part of her seriously thinking about marrying the other man?<br />
Nate just looked at her, fighting to hold back the tears in his eyes and the rage in his soul because if he lost control, he honestly didn&#39;t know which would be released first: the angry werewolf or the emotionally hurt human that was still in love with the older werepanthress before him.<br />
Weres don’t really follow human standards when it comes to romance, but the fact Kenya wasn&#39;t immediately forthcoming with an answer for either him or whoever the other man was didn&#39;t help matters.<br />
Instead, Nate just let the box with the engagement ring fall out of his hand.<br />
As Kenya watched it hit the ground, the ring fell out of the box and landed in the dirt edging of the park sidewalk, but Nate had already turned around and was walking away before he did something he would regret for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
That Saturday afternoon after Thanksgiving, Julie Stovall sat in her bed staring at the ceiling with nothing to do.<br />
She had been grounded since her parents found out Eric Anderson dumped her after discovering Julie had been cheating on him.<br />
Part of her still believed it honestly wasn&#39;t her fault. <i>If Eric would of just put out and become a were-merman, we&#39;ve could of had such great times together,</i> pouted Julie.<br />
Yet the doctor&#39;s appointment her mother had scheduled for next week would determine whether or not Julie had inherited her father&#39;s &quot;cheating gene&quot;, as Melissa Stovall referred to her husband&#39;s infidelity.<br />
<i>Maybe when Eric finds out that it&#39;s medical and wasn&#39;t intentional, he&#39;ll be willing to restart a relationship with me,</i> thought Julie.<br />
<i>Then, after I take his virginity and Eric becomes a were-merman, I could dump him!</i><br />
Not knowing about Eric&#39;s new and serious relationship with Spencer Lawson, Julie smiled and thought about how she would go about her new objective to (temporarily) win Eric back when everyone returned to class Monday after the holiday weekend.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Alyssa Cooper* stood nude in front of the full length mirror in the master bedroom of her private home in San Diego, holding up dresses against her very desirable body, trying to decide which to pack for her impending trip to Moon Lake.<br />
She had not seen Martin Stovall, the were-merman who turned her and made all of Alyssa&#39;s dreams of becoming a beautiful mermaid real in years, but she was more than looking forward to rekindling an old flame.<br />
Since becoming a were herself, Alyssa found she had to make some adjustments in her life. She couldn&#39;t have sex with &quot;normals&quot; any more unless they wanted to become were-mers too, and she had to keep ordering the were-mermaid birth control pill from that private pharmacy in Moon Lake to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And there were PLENTY of opportunities where she might have become pregnant over the years otherwise.<br />
When she acquired her new home, Alyssa had to switch the swimming pool to fresh water, which had become more expensive in the current California drought.<br />
Yet the most difficult personal change was that since there never seemed to be enough were-males of any species around to satisfy her, Alyssa had to sexually open herself up to her own gender, but was now quite comfortable being bi, although she would still take a good hard cock over a juicy pussy any day of the week.<br />
Yet there was no way she would ever give up being a were-mermaid even if it was possible.<br />
Alyssa had swam in places even experienced divers could only dream of. A few stray gold coins found here or there, along with an occasional shipwreck relic or handful of pearls had provided a great supplemental income to her position as the legal representative for the construction company that did jobs all up and down the Pacific Coast, even Moon Lake.<br />
She had met other weres in and out of the water, fully enjoying the benefits of a were&#39;s more active libido. While the were-mermen were still her favorite, especially deep in the water when they were deep within her; Alyssa&#39;s thoughts always went back to the one she had not seen in years. Martin Stovall, the were-mer that opened up a whole new world to her.<br />
She looked forward to seeing him again. Alyssa looked forward to having sex with him again too, for not only was he her first were, but one of the best she ever had as well.<br />
The fact that he was married now, and with a daughter, didn&#39;t do much to discourage her. Alyssa had kept up somewhat with Moon Lake news through the pharmacy staff whenever she renewed her prescription.<br />
<i>The daughter&#39;s probably too young, but maybe the wife might like a threesome,</i> was the happy thought that crossed Alyssa&#39;s mind as she put the latest dress down and cupped her very ample bosom, one of the many benefits of becoming a were.<br />
<i>There is no way I&#39;m leaving Moon Lake without feeling Martin&#39;s hard cock deep in me once more,</i> vowed Alyssa, as she forgot all about packing to go for a &quot;swim&quot;.<br />
______________________________________________________________________________<br />
*I checked all previous Moon Lake of Earth-2 mentions of her and found no last name listed.<br />
AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES...<br />
For some unknown reason(s) the were-mers of Earth-2 do NOT develop the same romantic and emotional bonds between their beloved soul mates like their Earths 1 and 3 counterparts do; hence Martin Stovall&#39;s troubled marriage, Julie Stovall cheating on Eric Anderson to begin with, and Alyssa Cooper&#39;s ongoing sexual cravings.—tmw.</p>
