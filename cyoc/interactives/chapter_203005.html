<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>“The formerly feminine young woman is now a testosterone fueled manly man…” </b><br />
<br />
Is what the app wrote as you beheld not Emma, but Emmet as he was caught up in his work, ogled by two men who were now intensely focused on his virile chest. Your cock stirred, had you always been this… Bi? Had to be the case, as Emmet looked up, right into your eyes before smiling and bouncing his chest in front of you almost obscenely before going back to reading the notes in front of him. The sentence disappeared as reality wrote itself to have always been this way.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t help it, Emmet was a sight for sore eyes and you were beginning to feel as slack jawed as the other men. But now, you had the app, this magical, amazing app that could let you change something in the universe with just one word. And you were beginning to feel like a god on the playing field, and Emmet was your first step into making that ideal reality.<br />
<br />
You brought up the app to see the change as you cleared you throat and stepped back a bit. As if to compliment you, time seemed to slowdown around you so that no one else could tell what was going on:<br />
<br />
<b>“The well endowed muscular man is sitting, having his manly chest ogled by two gay men&quot;. </b><br />
<br />
Once again you could feel your dick flick at the words, and the idea of seeing Emmet bulk up was on your mind, sure, he had a nice physique…<br />
<br />
You looked up for emphasis, seeing the nicely tightened shirt was struggling to contain him.<br />
<br />
…But he could be larger, of course, more manly, more… What would be a good word to describe what you were thinking of…?<br />
<br />
Suddenly it clicked into your head as you licked your lips and typed, replacing the word “man.”:<br />
<br />
<b>“The well endowed muscular bodybuilder is sitting, having his manly chest ogled by two gay men.” </b><br />
<br />
You submitted enter, only to receive a short warning on your screen, the app replying “Caution, correction applied.”<br />
<br />
You didn’t mind it, and looked up to see your work as Emmet’s clothes grew transparent, the muscles in his body inflating like a balloon with air as his traps reached closer to his thickened neck. His chest, while manly, expanded before your very eyes as they popped a button on Emmet’s white dress shirt, body hair thinning out as though he had trimmed it. His neck tie tightened as his throat bulged out with an even larger Adam&#39;s apple, ensuring a deep baritone voice as the tie unraveled itself, slipping off before fading away completely to give way to the man&#39;s growing neck.<br />
<br />
A deep indent formed as Emmet unconsciously flexed, just as his deltoids surged outwards into boulders. Not one to be forgotten, his arms engorged on themselves, the sleeves rolling up at first, before tears of the fabric formed. In a matter of seconds, Emmet’s arms sleeves ripped leaving his arms free to grow even larger, veins criss crossing around as protein rich muscle was cultivated by the app.<br />
<br />
You felt your heart hitch as you thought all was over, until Emmet nonchalantly grew once again, grunting as his back and lats flexed outwards, tearing the shirt in two and not even being phased. His abdominals were clean, but they two became more pronounced, striated muscles burning away the remainder fat around his serratus. His gut rearranged, creating a thick, strong box like core as his obliques came into clear view, leading down to his even stronger package.<br />
<br />
The growth had not stopped, as Emmet’s pert butt cheeks firmed up, the gluteus Maximus living up to its name as Emmet rose higher in height as his ass inflated. His crotch continued to lurch forward, until it snapped the zipper allowing the beast to grow freely, Emmet’s thighs increasing in mass while his cock fought for space. His pants, alas, could not handle the pressure, as football like calves erupted from the pant sleeves, before clearly tear in half as well as Emmet’s tear drop quads destroyed their confinements.<br />
<br />
Emmet breathed in greedily as his upper body was still slowly increasing, to the point it was becoming hard to look at Emmet as anything but wall, the cheap office seat creaking as Emmet’s body mass was rising beyond the average man. Complimenting the change, the transparency of his clothes became far less noticeable as his clothes were disappearing into the aether, leaving nothing behind beyond his shoes and what was to your surprise, a now very tight boxers.<br />
<br />
But the app was not done with Emmet yet, familiar vascular veins trailing the lower body and his gargantuan cock the now was throbbing akin to your own. The boxers shrunk, warping in on themselves as cheap cotton was reworked into a shiny polyester finish. His belt was the last to fade, the buckle removing itself as the leather became the straps holding the beast running tightly around Emmet’s thick 34 inch waist. To finish off, as rhinestones shone onto the poser, the buckle morphed into a number card that was clipped onto Emmet’s poser, a basic number 24.<br />
<br />
Finally, you regarded Emmet as his darker hair had been clipped and styled rather masculinely, short but modern, stubble graced his strengthening jaw as it jutted out handsomely, erasing whatever minuscule femininity remained in his body as his face became handsomely brutish. Emmet in all manner of words, had become an epitome of musculature, and he was sitting right in front of you working the front desk in a goofy pair of glasses reading notes for the dorms.<br />
<br />
The app buzzed in your hand again as everything started to go back to normal, as odd as the phrasing was.<br />
<br />
<b>“The well endowed muscular bodybuilder is sitting, having his manly body ogled by three gay men.”</b>  The app had remarked.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute, three, that wasn’t—<br />
<br />
The sentence faded, as quickly as it came as reality rewrote itself once again. You looked to the side and saw the same two men gazing at Emmet like a pack of hungry hyenas, you felt somewhat comforted knowing you weren’t the only gay man wanting the hunk of meat.<br />
<br />
You still weren’t done yet, though, as you generated the app sentence to change again.<br />
<br />
<b>“The well endowed bodybuilder is posing, having his manly body ogled by gay men.”</b><br />
<br />
The app beeped, and as you looked up, Emmet had now been flexing his massive muscles for all to see, a shiny bronze tan had already developed across his sweaty body as the front desk had created an easily pushable door for Emmet to have guests come by and touch his muscles. Complimentary of the school campus dormitory to have new bodybuilders, you found yourself saying in your head as the app rewrote reality to make this normalized. And by the looks of it, it was working as Emmet absentmindedly made a most muscular pose, grunting. You saw the monster in his poser throb as he peeked your gaze once again, winking as he struck another pose.<br />
<br />
You gripped your phone tightly, as you felt yourself overwhelmed by lust. Maybe it wasn’t a bad idea to chat with Emmet… Maybe it wasn’t a bad idea to explore to see what else or who else you could change… Or even, maybe, you wanted to change yourself.<br />
&#8232;Whatever the option, you now felt comfortable with being a fellow gay man on campus with an even hotter eye candy working your dorm’s front desk.</p>
