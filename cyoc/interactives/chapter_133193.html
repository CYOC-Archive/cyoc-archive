<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Philip heard what sounded like two sets of footsteps beginning to enter the bathroom, eyeing the mirror as best as he could to get a glimpse of them, but being in the end stall did not provide him with a good enough angle when stuck in a fixed position.<br />
 <br />
As they entered he could hear their voices, &quot;I know you didn&#39;t want to come to this today, but your weight has been growing for years, look at yourself in this large mirror. They put these in here you know just to shame people into action&quot; the one voice said. It had just dawned on Philip why the large mirror was like that &quot;guess that makes sense&quot; he thought to himself as the two continued to argue outside of his view.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I know mom I&#39;ve been depressed for years since you and dad split up, I&#39;ve been bullied for years and no one did anything about it&quot; Philip could tell this voice was the sound of a young female adult.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Your what.... 598 pounds at 22 years old, its crazy I never thought I&#39;d have such a fat sow for a daughter!&quot; the outright shame from the mother really did a number on Philip, he knew she had her daughters best interest in mind but shaming isn&#39;t going to help at this point.<br />
 <br />
Philip heard audible crying as the mother entered another stall, Philip could hear her use the toilet, while her daughter cleared her eyes near the sinks just by the entrance. With an audible flush the mother stormed out once more.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You see that stall at the end come its for people like you&quot; the abuse in her voice startled Philip as he realised they was moving towards his direction.<br />
 <br />
As they approached he began to see their reflection in the mirror. The mother stopped in his doorway with the very large daughter behind. &quot;You see that, that&#39;s what you have to use in here, as the normal toilets are too small and your weight would shatter them, now go and clean yourself up, I&#39;ll be in the waiting room you have 30 minutes until your appointment, don&#39;t make me come back in here with the nurses.&quot; Philip looked at the mothers face one last time as she walked away, he could see the anger but love she had for her daughter even as tears ran down her daughters face.<br />
 <br />
The entrance to the bathroom audibly closed as the mother left, but Philip started to brace himself as he began to take in the daughters appearance. She was wide, very wide as she entered the stall, her hips brushed the edges of the entrance to his stall, as she approached he could tell her tummy was very large as it looked to reach her knees as her jeans were tight and left little to the imagination, she had small breasts and a slim face, the kind of appearance that would shock you once you realise the rest off her if she had a online dating profile. Her arms where large but the biggest feature was her thighs and butt that give her stomach a wide appearance.<br />
 <br />
Finally she had finished waddling into his room closing the door behind her, on the inside door, Philip noticed for the first time what looked like another full body mirror through the gaps of her body.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Fucking bitch, she won&#39;t ever understand&quot; the girl said whilst wiping away her tears with the toilet paper from the dispenser beside him. As she calmed down she tossed the paper into his bowl. He could taste the salt in her tears. Philip didn&#39;t expect it and knew if she did her business he would experience that as well.<br />
 <br />
The daughter grasped his lid closing it to his relief as she sat down, Philip could feel her full weight but he knew he was more than strong enough to bear it. Philip struggled to see around her as me moved his point of view near his handle just about seeing over her shoulder.<br />
 <br />
In the reflection he could see her wide hips hanging over the sides of his seat and her belly hanging over her knees, she was undeniably obese, Philip began to come to terms with what he was and what he looked like with this obese female that sat on him now that the mirror was this close.<br />
 <br />
Whilst seated the daughter took off her her coat placing it on the near side hanger along with removing her top over her head and placing it beside her, she unzipped her jeans pulling her belly free as she fidgeted to drop them around her ankles, all this movement distracted Philip who couldn&#39;t help wonder why was she becoming undressed her belly was indeed huge with many rolls watching as she cradled it in her hands, moaning softly to Philips surprise.<br />
 <br />
As she used the hand rails on either side to rise from him he couldn&#39;t help wonder why she looked so happy all of a sudden, from behind her it looked like she was jiggling her tummy in front of the mirror. She then turned to her side, grasping at the folds, taking in the fat. &quot;She&#39;s loving it!&quot; Philip was shocked was everything else just fake he continued to ponder as she pandered around in front of him, looking in love with her own body.<br />
 <br />
She turned to face Philip moving closer, &quot;Well mom, how do you like this&quot; she lifted her belly on to his lid, he felt the weight as it spread across what used to be his upper lips, he could feel the sweat of her lower belly that oozed fat, it was at this point that Philip wished she had just done her business and went.<br />
 <br />
The daughter continued to dance about feeling every curve, to twerking to the mirror behind her as her breasts danced in front of Philip before finally reaching over for her bag. &quot;Where are they..&quot; she said fumbling through her bag, &quot;There you all are..&quot; Philip saw her smile to once again, she had a hand bag that reminded Philip of a old messenger bag he used to have as she pulled out a bunch of snacks in wrappers grasping in her hand as she turned around and sat once more on his lid.<br />
 <br />
Placing the plentiful snacks on her very large belly, she began slowly eating and moaning at the food placed in front of her, Philip had heard about foodies before on a documentary but never to this extent. He couldn&#39;t help but feel like he was some pervert watching someone pleasure themselves in such a strange fashion. Slowly she munched away her snacks he couldn&#39;t help but hoped that her appointment would be starting soon.<br />
 <br />
As she finished she pulled up her jeans to knee level stuffing her pockets full of wrappers.<br />
 <br />
*grumble* &quot;Ugh shouldn&#39;t have had so many&quot; she said getting up once more removing her underwear as she turned to lift his lid. &quot;No! She&#39;s really going to use me&quot; Philips mind started to panic he had just learned that if he could taste her tears he would taste her business.<br />
 <br />
As she sat down once more with a sigh of relief, Philip focused his attention to the window not wanting to move his point of view to the interior of his bowl. He saw in the corner of his vision that her eyes had started to squint. Suddenly she let out a huge fart that forced its way out of the gaps of his seat to his bowl, Philip could taste and smell it as it dissipated, in disgust he would be gagging but as a toilet he couldn&#39;t react in any form outside of crying out mentally.<br />
 <br />
For what felt like an eternity of her grunting, Philips point of view suddenly shifted to his interior bowl, &quot;What I didn&#39;t do that&quot; Philip tried hard as he could but his view wouldn&#39;t shift. Philip knew he would be forced to watch he couldn&#39;t even blink let alone stop viewing. Though it was poorly lit he could just about make out the anus above his vision between her buttcheeks and the water below thanks to the seams of light entering from the gaps of the seat that her hips didn&#39;t cover.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been constipated for so long..&quot; she moaned with one last grunt Philip watched as both poo and urine flowed into his bowl hitting what was his taste buds completely, the acid taste and fowl poo that was filling his bowl sent Philips thought&#39;s everywhere, why couldn&#39;t he look outside, why could he not look away?<br />
 <br />
Relaxing as she continued to produce diarrhea the pee came to and end. She relaxed as the stream stopped and his view shifting back, he could see her face she had a smile on her face looking relived as he was in a state of shock, &quot;Come on and flush me!&quot; he cried out mentally.<br />
 <br />
Using the hand rails she raised from his seat, leaning forward with her anus in full view along side her huge rear, he watched as she failed to wipe away the waste properly. She started to get redressed as Philip looked down at his bowl it was stained badly and he couldn&#39;t taste anything but the rancid gifts she had left him.<br />
 <br />
Finally pulling and pushing her belly back in to her jeans she placed on her coat, looking back to the toilet that was Philip. &quot;Time to get rid off the evidence&quot; she said throwing the empty wrappers in to his bowl as she flushed him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ahhhhhh&quot; Philip felt relief as the waste washed away from his bowl in such a blissful way down his throat and out his pipes. &quot;That was worth it... What am I thinking all that wait all that horror for that.. I know not many other jobs would give enjoyment but being the only thing she could change for me made this so worth while, ugh what am I saying I was just crapped in.. I guess if that change wasn&#39;t made it could be worse&quot; he tried to convince himself as he settled from the euphoria.<br />
 <br />
The daughter had finally finished getting dressed, she waddled out of his stall closing the door behind her to being barely open as he heard her leave the bathroom entirely.<br />
 <br />
Philip now saw himself close up as nothing but a disability toilet getting a proper look at what he was, &quot;I know I&#39;m a toilet, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever be able to handle this but my god the flushes are amazing&quot; admitting that he was getting a form of enjoyment without cost well almost, gave him some relief knowing that as long as he was flushed he could make it through the day.<br />
 <br />
His thoughts continued to wonder about who just came, &quot;She was a weird one, I bet she will be coming back for years, god help her if her family ever realises what she is up to&quot; Philip thought as he began to wonder about being unable to move his point of vision as well as thoughts about what would come next.</p>
