<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria felt a little self-conscious walking to the pool. She began to wish she&#39;d worn a towel, too. Her body was attracting a fair amount of attention.<br />
<br />
She realized, funnily enough, that a lot of these guests probably assumed she was a man who had turned himself into a woman for the weekend and was just showing off. She nearly snorted as she thought of this. Won&#39;t they all be surprised, once she reached the pool.<br />
<br />
She finally arrived and found that she had to enter through a locker room. She almost went into the women&#39;s room, but stopped and looked down at herself. Was this still the right door to use? She could see no difference in her body yet. She was just as female as she&#39;d always been. Before going in, though, she noticed a third door. Next to &#39;Male&#39; and &#39;Female&quot; there was a third door labeled &quot;And the Rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Makes sense, she thought, but she didn&#39;t need that just yet. Gloria entered the women&#39;s locker room. She saw a lot of women in the shower just staring at themselves. These were probably all men getting acquainted with their new female forms. It was amusing, but she didn&#39;t want to be rude and stare. Gloria quickly rinsed off in a shower and then stepped out onto the pool deck. She grabbed a towel from a bin and found a reclining pool chair to lay it out on.<br />
<br />
She looked around the pool at an incredible sight. There were a variety of incredibly attractive people walking around, swimming, and sunbathing. Nearly all of them were walking awkwardly or touching their bodies in very slow, nervous ways. As weird as this experience was about to be, clearly she was not alone.<br />
<br />
Gloria looked at her body again, wondering when this was supposed to start. Seeing no change, she figured she might as well enjoy the pool. She dove in and swam to the center of the pool underwater.<br />
<br />
The instant her skin touched the water, she felt her bikini start to warm up. It wasn&#39;t unpleasant, just unexpected. She continued to swim under the surface, and in a matter of seconds felt variety of strange sensations happen simultaneously.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed was that her arms and legs seemed to become more powerful. Each stroke propelled her further in the pool than she&#39;d have ever thought possible. She also seemed to sink lower, it became harder to float near the surface. Gloria felt the familiar presence of her long hair disappear from her neck and shoulders. Although she couldn&#39;t explain how she knew this, she was certain that those shoulders were now wider than they used to be.<br />
<br />
The bikini top suddenly felt restrictive. It was squeezing her chest, pressing her breasts flatter than they&#39;d ever been before. What should have felt painful actually felt incredible as she felt them literally melt into her body. She was becoming more streamlined... boxier, actually! Her legs kicked and she could tell that her hips and butt were shrinking. Everything about her was becoming less feminine.<br />
<br />
She felt the bikini top tugging on some hair, not unlike how a twisted bikini bottom might pull on her pubic hair. But this was on her chest. She had hair there! A hairy chest! Gloria couldn&#39;t see it yet but the feeling was unmistakable.<br />
<br />
She was nearing the center of the pool and was almost out of breath. Gloria sunk to the bottom and planted her feet on the cement, preparing to launch herself up and out of the water. As her feet landed she could sense their size; they were nearly twice as large as they had been before. And so much further away from her face. She was pretty sure she was a solid foot taller than when she&#39;d entered the pool.<br />
<br />
Gloria pushed down on the pool&#39;s bottom and shot towards the surface. In the one and a half seconds the trip took, she felt 3 distinct things happen.<br />
<br />
The first was her bikini top completely falling off. Her now-flat chest had no chance of holding on to it. Her once-glorious boobs that the bikini had clung to no longer existed. Gloria panicked at the sensation but realized it was now perfectly acceptable for her to be topless in public.<br />
<br />
The second sensation was the feeling of her clit exploding in size, growing from a pencil eraser to a bratwurst in under a second. Although distinctly different, the metamorphous made her think of all the times she&#39;d slipped a dildo inside herself. That first, incredible feeling of being &quot;full&quot; felt a lot like growing a penis, strangely enough! That alone would have been crazy enough, but what really got her attention was the third sensation.<br />
<br />
Gloria felt her vagina invert and push out of her body. The skin from her tunnel formed two sacks that were immediately filled by her dropping ovaries, themselves transforming into relatively huge testes.<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s new external genitalia popped into existence in the same moment her new, large, muscular, hairy male body broke the surface of the water. She yelled out in triumph and found her new deep voice startling. She was not just a boy, as she&#39;d expected. Gloria was a full fledged MAN. And it felt incredible!</p>
