<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen panicked. She can&#39;t possibly open the door and let Kyle see her transformed this way, inside her house! Her plan to trick him is suddenly ruined. And that was that, the little schoolboy had to go now, for good! Jen thought fast. She simply yelled &quot;I&#39;m in the shower, just a minute and I&#39;ll be done!&quot; She did her best to alter her voice to sound as believebly feminine as possibile, obviusly, and fortunately it didn&#39;t turn out too bad. As she ran upstairs to her room to take of the school uniform as fast as she could, she heard Kyle&#39;s voice in response. &quot;Ok no probs, I&#39;ll wait!&quot; Phew. Ok, she had to hurry. She got naked in under a minute and thankfully her transformation receded just as fast. Now back to her real, 16 year old female and white self, Jenny thought she still better put some clothes on, no way that she would let Kyle Perkins see her naked! She opened the wardrobe and grabbed the first thing she could get her hands on: a tight, sexy minidress she usually wore when picking up guys at the clubs... It will have to do, she decided, and she zipped it up along her back, not bothering to even put on a bra and panties first! She jumped into the first pair of high heels she saw and rushed back downstairs. &quot;Coming!&quot; Jenny yells. Kyle annoyingly rang the freaking doorbell every like ten seconds, &quot;Impatient freak!&quot; Jen muttered to herself, then she put on a forced half smile and opened the door... <br />
&quot;Theeere you are, Jen.&quot; Kyle chirped. <br />
&quot;Here I am, ha ha!&quot; <br />
&quot;Sorry if I interrupted something&quot; <br />
&quot;Uhm, nah don&#39;t worry, haha I wasn&#39;t really doing anything. I was alone. Yeah&quot; Jenny was speaking kind of fast and awkwardly. Kyle notices she&#39;s panting a bit from all that dressing in a hurry and running up an down the stairs. He also notices how beautiful she was, but hey, nothing unusual there! <br />
&quot;Okay. Jen before you say anything, let me tell you right away that you don&#39;t have to be nervous about me being here... Don&#39;t worry I don&#39;t mean you any harm, honestly!&quot; <br />
Jen raised a carefully tweezed eyebrow. &quot;Hmm, is that so? Says the guy who stalks me, usually does his best to scare me, the guy who hates my guts and oh yes, let&#39;s not forget, the very guy who put a freaking curse on me this morning...&quot; Jen started off with a firm voice tone but by the end of her phrase, it kind of became apparent that she was a bit shaken. Kyle saw that her beautiful blue eyes became shinier like she might tear up... He cringed. &quot;Jen... Listen, I, I&#39;m sorry. Please don&#39;t cry... I don&#39;t...hate you Jenny! Far from it actually, believe me.&quot; <br />
Jennifer wiped a forming tear from her eyes. &quot;Then why do you terrorize me Kyle?! Why? Why did you curse me?...&quot; <br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry, I mean it! I guess... I dunno I guess all the frustration I got because you kept rejecting me turned to anger or something... I know it&#39;s wrong. And I shouldn&#39;t have freakin cursed you, worst of all! I feel really bad about it now. Look Jen I came here to remove the curse, ok?&quot; <br />
Jenny looked genuinely surprised at this turn of events. She starts off with &quot;Hmpf. Yeah well you should feel bad about it! Kyle if you like a girl, news flash, cursing her and terrorizing her will not get you anything good.&quot; Kyle nods meekly. Jen&#39;s expression softens and she continues. &quot;But... I have to admit that I wasn&#39;t a saint to you either. I mean I started picking on you, making fun of you for liking sci fi and other geeky stuff, then when I found out you were bisexual I started calling you a fag too, along with all the jocks I dated... Yeah, not cool, so I&#39;m sorry too, I guess...&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah. Listen Jen I don&#39;t need you to apologize, I&#39;m the one that really exaggerated haha&quot; <br />
Jenny let out a bit of a giggle and then she put her hand on Kyle&#39;s arm. &quot;Listen... how about you come inside, let&#39;s sit down a bit and talk, you know so we stop standing here in the door way like idiots, hahah&quot; <br />
Kyle also lightened up and the two of them went inside the house together. They started chatting in a friendly way, and Kyle couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit turned on by Jen&#39;s impromptu clubbing outfit. Since the curse was actually still active, the sexy attire was having a slight effect on Jennifer too! While it wouldn&#39;t cause her any physical changes, since these were her own clothes, the outfit did reflect a certain flirty mood and it was making her start feeling more open and well, flirty... <br />
&quot;So Kyle, is it just me or did you hint at the fact that you might have some sort of major crush on me?&quot; Jen suddenly asked, playfully, shifting the mood of their little conversation. <br />
Kind of reluctant at first, Kyle ended up admitting and he confessed his long standing attraction for her. Jen looked unsurprised, after all, every guy, or nearly every guy wants her! But still she felt flattered by this clumsy love declaration, and giggling, she commanded Kyle to stand up and come nearer. The fake authoritarian voice caused Kyle&#39;s already aroused dick to stand in attention, and obviously like a good boy he did exactly what his beloved, beautiful Jennifer told him! When they were face to face Jen suddenly planted a warm kiss on his mouth. A quick, tentative peck at first, but seen as he obviously wouldn&#39;t reject something like this, Kyle eagerly returned the kiss and they actually made out for a few long seconds! When she broke it off, Jen grinned like a madwoman right in his face. &quot;I bet you dreamed about doing this for years, amirite?&quot; Jenny said, in a half seductive, half comical voice. &quot;Well what do you think? Guilty as charged, haha&quot; Kyle laughs a bit himself to hide the fact that he was super happy not to mention horny... Jenny was about to surprsise him even further though. Without warning, she playfully shoves him so that he falls backwards down on the couch, and before he could say anything, Jen was kneeling on him like some professional lap dancer! She undid his belt and zipper, and pulled down his jeans and she gently stroked his rigid member with one tapered soft finger... Kyle couldn&#39;t believe this was actually happening. And boy did it look like she knew what she was doing...figures, it wasn&#39;t for nothing that Jenny was known as the school slut, as much as Kyle still worshipped her, he knew her reputation. <br />
Jen took Kyle&#39;s shaft into her mouth and began sucking him off like a real pro... He felt like he was about to explode when she suddenly stopped and jumped on top of him, her wet and exposed pussy rubbing against his lap, from underneath that short vinyl dress of hers... &quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; She purred. Kyle nods his head, mouth still open. &quot;Well it gets even better, mister Perkins! Since you&#39;ve been such a good guy and apologized, and since you&#39;re going to take that mean curse off of me...well, I, the girl of your dreams, shall reward you with sex... You wanna fuck me Kyle?...&quot; His eyes were wide as saucers now. He nods timidly. &quot;Kyle...you want to fuck me... Tell me who you want to fuck right in her pussy!&quot; <br />
&quot;....Y-you. You!&quot; <br />
&quot;Who am I, mister Perkins?&quot; She continues to tease... <br />
&quot;J-Jen... Jennifer...&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m your Jenny, Kyle. Your princess, your Idol your fucking wet dream.&quot; And she suddenly jumps off of him and takes his right hand in hers. &quot;Come on, get up lover boy, let&#39;s go to my bedroom, ok?&quot; <br />
No need to ask him twice, of course. The two of them go upstairs to Jen&#39;s room, they strip, she hands him a condom and when he climbs on top of her she asks him if he never did this before. Kyle tells her that he&#39;s not a virgin, although he only had sex once with a girl, other than that only with guys. Jen snorts at this, then she remembers she shouldn&#39;t pick on him or be homophobic so she says &quot;Sorry sorry, my bad. Old habits die hard.&quot; <br />
With a thrust of arousement and a bit of anger too, because of the homophobic remark, he shuts her up by sticking his dick in her hard, and although she wasn&#39;t expecting it she wasn&#39;t particularly phased... As he starts pumping into her, she moans and screams like she does with all the guys. God did Jen enjoy sex! Kyle didn&#39;t last very long though, and he suddenly tensed up and shot his load... Incredibly Jennifer Smith and Kyle Perkins just had sex, ha ha. But Kyle still didn&#39;t remove Jenny&#39;s curse though, soooo what does he have in mind? Is he planning something?</p>
