<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake and Leshawn were restless after a day of exams and the two roommates decided it would be fun to blow off some steam and play some ball. <br />
<br />
The other locker rooms seemed busy and Jake pointed out another one just down the hall and they walked to the door. Above the frame was a title that read “Global Gym” with a colored globe at the end. <br />
<br />
Jake was 18, fresh out of high school. He was smart for his age but what he made up for in smarts, he lacked in the physical department. He was your average, run of the mill white kid and grew up in a Colorado suburb. He was roughly 6 feet tall and lanky with little muscle. Though he tried his hardest in high school, he couldn’t seem to get a girlfriend. After rumors of his small, cut manhood traveled from the high school gym days, he was self conscious and all the more willing to go the the less crowded locker room. <br />
<br />
Leshawn, on the other hand, was a sweet-talking, handsome 23 year old, about to graduate, but just by the skin of his teeth.  His dark brown complexion was beautiful as was his meticulously kept jet black hair. Leshawn met Jake in a tutoring session when he was having difficulty in Chemistry. Try as he might, his education was not the best, coming from a poorer school district in Chicago. His talent in basketball was almost as noteworthy as his talent with the ladies. Word around school was he had the perfect equipment and knew how to please the other person well. <br />
<br />
Jake reasoned they could learn a few things from each other and they were inseparable after the first week of tutoring Chemistry and basketball lessons. <br />
<br />
As Leshawn pushed the door open his eyes landed on the sign that read, “No locker vacancies, choose a locker and switch out the clothes, only then  can you walk in someone else’s shoes”. Leshawn raised a brow and turned towards Jake. He shrugged, relieved this locker room was practically dead inside. As they walked in they noticed the row of lockers seemed endless. They were all sorts of colors, shapes, and sizes, with intricate little details near the latch. Jake drew closer to one in the middle row of lockers out of curiosity and noticed what looked like a DNA breakdown with what looked like a Colombian had the highest percentage. He also noticed the locker was a bright brown color and the latch was rainbow covered. Next to the clasp , it read, Hispanic, same age. He turned back to Leshawn. “What the hell is this place?” Leshawn raised his hand to scratch his head. “No clue bro, Imma move down to this one,” he pointed out a similarly slim locker but a level below. <br />
<br />
Leshawn studied the locker and noted it had a flag on it too. “Yo Jake, what flag is this?”. <br />
<br />
“That looks like the Philippines flag with the sun in the triangle?”<br />
<br />
Leshawn continued studying the locker and noticed it had two Mars/male symbols interlocked and the writing said Asian, younger. “Dude let’s just get changed and go play some ball. Weird theme they chose for this locker room, right?”<br />
<br />
Jake opened his locker and noticed there was nothing hanging. “No vacancies, huh? Boom! Proved them wrong” <br />
<br />
Leshawn opened his and noticed the same and looked quizzically at Jake. “Wherever man, start changing- We’re wasting the court time” <br />
<br />
Leshawn started undressing and Jake reluctantly followed suit. As he threw his shirt in he noticed it disappeared. “Holy shit dude! Look at this!” Jake threw in his shorts and watched as they disappeared. Seconds later, a black damp sleeveless shirt and green short workout shorts appeared in exchange. “Whoa!” Leshawn was at a loss for words. <br />
<br />
“Umm okaaay?”, Leshawn managed to mumble. Jake threw in the rest of his gear and replacement items appeared, slightly worn down and different materials, until he was down to his boxers. “No turning back now”. He motioned for Leshawn to turn around as he was embarrassed for his friend to see him naked. As he threw in his checkered boxers a yellowish-white jock strap appeared to hang in the locker. Wanting to quickly put something on, he withheld his disgust and snatched them up, noting they smelled ripe with sweat and...was that?...no couldn’t be. He held it up to his nose. Yep, definitely cum. <br />
<br />
“Uuuhhh Leshawn? We have a problem. Do you have any extra underwear or shorts? These are definitely someone’s sweat-dripping stuff, this is so gross. I can’t do it...” Leshawn looked back and was in the process of throwing his silk boxer briefs in. Jake noticed how perfect Leshawn looked but quickly shook the thought, internally thinking “What was that about? Must still be thinking about the cum after smelling it...” <br />
<br />
Leshawn sheepishly replied,” Sorry Jake, threw mine in as well and I got this weird cloth looking thing...guess it’s underwear? I Don think we have a choice! I don’t have any other clothes left!”<br />
<br />
Jake reluctantly picked up the sweaty, cum stained jock and started fitting his legs in front of the ass straps. “What did I get myself into, this is so gross.”<br />
<br />
Leshawn fitted the tight cloth over his junk, but struggled to keep all 8”  inside. The fabric strained initially bit he noticed is started to become loose. “Maybe it just needed to stretch out,” he thought. <br />
<br />
As the wet jock touched Jake’s penis head, he shivered, partly out of disgust, partly because the wetness was actually cold. “Ew, ew, ew”. <br />
<br />
Jake felt weird with his ass exposed to the cool air of the locker room. He never wore anything like this before- why would he? Then he noticed something else that felt odd. The jock started warming up as a chill went through his spine and he felt his balls swell, as though they were soaking up the sweat and cum juices. Next he felt an itch, turned away from Leshawn, and pulled the top strap away to inspect his junk. He watched in awe as foreskin started growing over the top of his expanding mushroom head. A rich brown hue started to cover first his ballsack and then moved to his penis. Simultaneously, his brown pubes turned dark black and sucked into his skin as though neatly trimmed. <br />
<br />
“Leshawn!! What the fuck is goi—-“, but Jake couldn’t finish his sentence as he turned around and saw a unmistakably younger version of Leshawn in front of him. He must of been the same age now. Leshawn whimpered and felt his shortening manhood fit nicely into his loin cloth. He looked at Jake and mouthed “help”. Before Jake could reply he noticed the brown shade from before was spreading down his torso and his legs. <br />
<br />
He grabbed the short silver colored shorts in an effort to hide what we didn’t want to admit was happening- he was changing, he didn’t know how but he hoped putting  on the musky black gym shirt would cover it. <br />
<br />
Leshawn felt a sense of vertigo when he tried to pull the brightly colored gym shorts over his shrinking manhood as the floor seemed to be closer than it was a moment ago- he was getting shorter. His skin tightened and drained black color and in exchange a beautiful tanned brown started forming. He too threw on a much too tight sleeveless shirt, hoping to hide what was happening. <br />
<br />
“I gotta check this out!” Jake ran to the mirror and watched as the color accelerated through his arms, up his neck and through his face. His previously blonde hair darkened to black and became coarse. He brought his hands to his face as a shadow of dark facial hair started to fork over his now rounder lips. His brows thickened and arched to a perfectly trimmed brow. He flinched through pain as his facial features shifted to a handsome Hispanic face looking back at him. He didn’t look older, he was just different. In fact, he wasn’t.. what was his name again “Que es mi lla—?!?” He clapped his smaller hands over his mouth at the sound of natural Spanish coming from his lips. “Dios mio”. His hands went to the counter for balance and he winced in pain as he heard what had to have been his back bones becoming smaller, his frame became smaller but his arms more defined. Veins were now visible and his pecs formed perfect mounds under his darkening nipples. A black ink tattoo began to inscribe itself first on his left chest and then on to his shoulder and left arm. The ink burnt and memories formed with it. He removed he came from a humble familia that immigrated to the States from Columbia after he was born. His older brothers were there to raise him with his mother after their Dad left. He made money working for the orchards in California and met a friend that changed his life.. then Jorge snapped back to reality. Meanwhile he could hear Leshawn screaming back near the benches..” I’m coming!” He held his hand to his throat, shocked at how accented, and higher pitched it was. <br />
<br />
When he arrived, Leshawn was bent over in pain. His previously built arms shrunk to sticks and he resembled an 18 year old build. He was no longer 6’ 1” but looked to be 5’ 4”. His face was a handsome brown with almond shaped eyes and thin, dark brows. He was handsome and Jorge couldn’t control the erection the now propped up his jock. Leshawn tried to speak but it was broken English and significantly higher pitched than before. “What..happen..us?” A strong accent muffled his previous confidence. He reached out to Jorge and as soon as they made contact Leshawn remembered he met Jorge in the orchard work, they grew up in the same neighborhood of LA and became good friends, in fact, more than good friends. He remembers kissing Jorge passionately at Pride last year, thankful he had someone to be with after his family shamed him for being gay. Thankfully Le..no... “What my name” Natha..? Yes! Nathan! Nathan clung to Jorge. He was a couple inches shorter but he still felt Jorge’s hardening cock run up against his and looked up for a kiss. As Jorge and Nathan locked lips, a new tattoo spread on Jorge’s back. It was Nathan’s name in a beautiful pride flag. <br />
<br />
“What do to say we play futbol today mi amor?<br />
<br />
Nathan beamed with excitement, “yes that sounds great..I want to get my clothes as stinky as you” he teased. Jorge knew Nathan was turned on by his musk and cum stained jock. <br />
<br />
Thinking of his jock, Jorge lowered his shorts and Nathan drooled a little. Jorge naturally bent over, his hole ready for breeding as though they had done this a thousand times. “Come on babe, nobody’s here,” Jorge teased. Without a second thought, Nathan dropped his shorts and loin cloth and his meaty, thick, cut tool was hard and exposed, ready to penetrate. With little more than his spit and pre-cum, Nathan lodged his penis in his boyfriend’s hole and proceeded to pound him. Jorge was in bliss, moaning in ecstasy as his gay identity cemented itself into his very being. After minutes of sweaty sex, Nate finally came and pumped Jorge full of his seed. They laughed at themselves for having sex in a public locker room without anyone catching them and then kissed. “We should probably get on the field Popi,” Jorge wiped the sweat from his brow. <br />
<br />
They played soccer and when they were done, they came back to the locker room. “Wait.. which one our locker”, Nathan asked. “I think we might just have to pick one and open them up babe”<br />
<br />
Nathan and Jorge  looked down the rows of lockers, unsure of where to start. They decided to pick...</p>
