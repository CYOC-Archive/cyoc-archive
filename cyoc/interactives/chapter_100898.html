<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In her excitement, Gina forgot to set her alarm. So her Dad was a little concerned when she didn&#39;t come down for breakfast.  Gina and Jake were still sound asleep when her Dad tried to open the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, are you okay?  You better get up or you are going to be late for school, &quot; said her Dad, as he tried to twist open the locked door knob.  &quot;And why is this door locked?  You know how I feel about locked doors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina and Jake jumped up in bed and looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick!  Get in the closet! &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake started to get out of bed when they heard the door unlock, and saw it slowly open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, he must have the key, &quot; whispered Gina.  &quot; Just hide under the sheets, and I will try to get rid of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake bunched up the sheets, and did his best to hide his massive body underneath them.  Gina jumped up and met her Dad at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Daddy! Sorry I overslept, &quot; said Gina, as she tried to close the door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, I thought I heard voices.  Who were you talking to?  And why won&#39;t you let me in your room?&quot; said her Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just on the phone, that&#39;s all, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Dad shoved open the door, knocking Gina back a bit.  &quot;Talking on the phone?  While you were asleep?  I don&#39;t think so.  Who is in here?  A boy?&quot; said her Dad angrily.<br />
<br />
Jake peaked out of the blankets nervously.  He could tell where Gina got her height.  Her Dad towered over her, and looked very mean and intimidating. Dad quickly recognized the lumpy comforter for what it was, and pulled the sheets off of Jake. Jake nearly wet himself with fright, but it was Gina&#39;s Dad who looked more scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I can explain, &quot; said Gina rapidly. &quot;I met this girl on my way home from school today, and she looked exactly like me.  So I invited her home, to talk to her.  Then she said she didn&#39;t have any place to stay, so I let her spend the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad just stared at Jake, and leaned in closer.  &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; asked her Dad.<br />
<br />
Jake panicked.  &quot;Ummm ......... Tina. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when were you born?&quot; asked her Dad.<br />
<br />
Gina mouthed her birth date behind her Dad&#39;s back to him, and Jake repeated it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who are your parents?&quot; asked her Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t know, Dad.  She&#39;s an orphan, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s Dad stood up, then rubbed his chin deep in thought.  Then he stormed out of the room.  Gina and Jake stood by the door, and heard loud shouting.  They couldn&#39;t hear the whole conversation, but could make out words like &quot;cheating&quot; and &quot;affair.&quot;  These were followed by other words like &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick, where is the medallion?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?  You can&#39;t switch back now!  How would we explain that?  It already sounds like my parents are going to get a divorce because of this, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care.  That is your problem, &quot; said Jake, as he started looking around the room. <br />
<br />
Gina pushed the medallion under the dresser with her foot, away from Jake&#39;s view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t find it.  Guess you&#39;ll just have to stick it out like this for a while, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake was about to protest when the heard the sound of several footsteps rapidly approaching the door. The door flung open, and Jake saw Gina&#39;s Dad and Mom staring at him.  Her Dad pointed at him angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?  I told you I was telling the truth.  Now tell me who it was?  Who were you sleeping with?&quot; said her Dad.<br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s Mom slowly approached Jake, then took his hand in hers, examining him carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing, &quot; she said, as she scanned his body.  It made Jake uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?  Who was it?&quot; said her Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one, you idiot, &quot; said her Mom over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you explain that?&quot; said her Dad, pointing at Jake.<br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s Mom turned and glared at her Dad, still holding Jake&#39;s hand.  &quot;Look at her you, you idiot.  She looks exactly like Gina. And you said they had the same birthday?  How could I cheat on you and give birth to a different child on the same day.  They are obviously twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s Dad paled.  &quot;Oh, &quot; he said with a little shame, as he mumbled an apology.  &quot;Well, how do you explain Gina having a twin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was her Mom&#39;s turn to look confused, rubbing her chin in thought.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  My only guess is that the hospital stole her or something.  I was a little out of it at the time during Gina&#39;s birth.  She was an usually large baby, and they gave me quite a bit of anesthetic. Who are your parents, dear?  Where do you live?&quot; asked her Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t know, Mom.  She said she  was in an orphanage, but I found her living on the streets,  &quot; lied Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you poor dear, &quot; said her Mom, as she patted her hand.  Jake was too shocked and scared to reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.  Well, the first thing we should do is sue the hospital.  And then call the police, &quot; said her Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please don&#39;t, &quot; said Gina.  &quot;They might take her away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will do no such thing, &quot; said her Mom. &quot;Tina is family.  But I don&#39;t think we should call anyone.  This poor girl has been through enough, and the last thing she needs is to be exhibited like some zoo animal by the media. Or have some lawyer or policeman make her relive some terrible memories.  No, what&#39;s done is done.  It is time to move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, what do you suggest?&quot; asked her Dad, perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think you are do for a vacation.  We all are. Maybe some time alone away from prying eyes will give us some perspective on how to introduce our new child to our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! A trip to the family cabin, &quot; said Gina excitedly.  &quot;You will have some much fun there, with just the family.  We can really get to know each other.  It&#39;ll be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake was beginning to get nervous.  Gina was a little too excited about his current predicament.  But he felt surrounded and outnumbered.  Suddenly, a very short, petite brunette girl poked her head into the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s all the shouting about?  Is Gina in trouble again? &quot; asked the young girl.  Her eyes went wide when she saw Jake.  &quot;Oh ..... my ..... God. You mean there are two of them now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed.  &quot;Brianna, meet your new sister, Tina.  Now, go pack your packs.  We are going on a little trip, &quot; said her Mom.<br />
<br />
Brin gave Jake a dirty look.  It was bad enough competing with one superstar sister, but now she had two?  The others were so accepting, but Brin knew there was something a little odd about the new girl.  And Brin was determined to find out her secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, girls, I think you better get packed, too, &quot; said her Mom, as she stood up and walked out the door with her husband.  &quot;Your father and I need to make some calls.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as they left the room, Jake angrily confronted Gina. &quot;What the hell was all that about?  I&#39;m your long lost twin sister, Tina?&quot; said Jake angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had to think of something.  What was I supposed to do? &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.  In twelve hours, I&#39;ll just switch back to myself and none of this will matter, &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can&#39;t! Everyone will be devastated if you disappear.  It will be like losing a family member, &quot; said Gina sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!  Screw your family! I have my own family that is probably already worried sick about me.  In twelve hours, I am changing back to myself and getting the hell out of here!&quot; said Jake angrily.<br />
<br />
Gina was about to correct him.  Jake could actually change back now, but he must have forgotten the rules in all of the excitement.  But Gina decided that after spending some time with her family as her sister she would be able to change his way of thinking, and get the sister she had always wanted. With a little help from the medallion , of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just make sure you pack that medallion, &quot; said Jake, as he started to get dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I will, &quot; said Gina, as she smiled wickedly, plotting her devilish schemes.  &quot;I will make certain that we use it again, as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
