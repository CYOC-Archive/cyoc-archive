<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Wondering what Ty meant as he left Dustin’s new girlish room. Dustin suddenly couldn’t stop thinking of who Ty has chosen to be Dustin’s boyfriend. Many ideas ran through his mind. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dustin knew he originally wasn’t into boys or gay, but he couldn’t stop wondering. <br />
	Dustin decided he couldn’t keep thinking about it and instead decided to go to bed. Remembering the wardrobe and dresser were full of girls cloths he expected all Ty had given him were sexy or barely modest cloths and was not disappointed. He elected a pair of pink shorts that barely covered his ass and  a shirt showed off his mid riff. <br />
	For some reason Dustin noticed he was not minding the clothing options as much as he first did. He decided that Ty must have done something to him again. <br />
	He got on to his phone as he realized was right beside his bed. Unsurprisingly he found that Ty had changed it to have a pink protective cover and the background had a rainbow unicorn. Luckily the apps on it were the same as before, with a few new ones that Dustin would guess are gay hook up apps or the like.  Surprisingly Going through his contacts Dustin notices that many changed to some of the more popular girls in school and <br />
	Dustin got on a basic mindless game when a text popped up. He didn’t recognize the number but knowing what Ty said he clicked on it. Surprisingly, or not knowing Ty, it was Andrew from the school chest club. He was actually two years younger but in Dustin’s grade as the kid was super smart. Not overly bullied as most kids in school figured it would be best to have the for all partnered assignments. He could be easily described as a scrawny nerd and complete geek. But Dustin could admit (especially now) that the kid was cute. His text was a simple ask: Would you like to go out with me?<br />
	Well, guess why not, Dustin thought to himself, and texted back a yes.<br />
	<br />
	Ty was in his room, which he continued to change as he was making himself a jock (not some steroid freak that some guys start to look) and was able to sense that Ty had told Andrew yes. He decided the chess champ was a good mix as being a geek he would not likely hurt Dustin and his new femboi emotions, and he wasn’t much taller than Dustin so he would nearly break his neck like he would most other guys at school. <br />
	Ty was surprised that Dustin was taking so well to being turned into the most extreme femboi possible, and was seriously considering making it permanent.<br />
	Ty decided then to work out in his basement workout room, feeling a need to increase his leg muscles a bit. <br />
<br />
	Dustin awoke the next day when his phone’s alarm went off, and went to get ready for his day. As he had decided to give dating Andrew a try he figured to see about wearing a medium length skirt with sheer panties and a cute pink blouse after showering (and how long it now took to shower with hair down to the small of his back, maybe he should ask Ty to shorten it) he then found a small amount of makeup and was surprised that he somehow knew how to apply it. After that when he looked in the mirror he though he looked like a cute girl….and then stopped when that thought came to hum and he was not repulsed by it. <br />
	He was headed down stairs to the garage where his car was when he nearly ran into Ty, who had definitely bulked up from how Dustin remembered him before. <br />
	“Ready to head back to school,” Ty asked with a smirk. Dustin was overly focused on his chest and arms, thinking Ty looked hot now that he hardly heard him.<br />
	“Do I still have my car,” Dustin asked Ty<br />
	“Of course, and looking good their Dustin. Very cute.” Ty’s reply made Dustin’s face flush ashe knew he was blushing.<br />
	The boys made it into the car and Dustin saw that with his new size there were some alterations made so his shorter stature could properly drive; and more surprised as the car wasn’t pink and even the interior was pretty close to being stock. Hover his steering wheel had a very flowery cover on it.<br />
	“Ty could you shorten my hair to make it more manageable,” Dustin asked as he started the car. Ty looked him over and said, “OK.”<br />
	Dustin then felt his hair come up to his shoulders and then braid itself. He decided to check it out when they got to school. “Thanks,” Dustin said.<br />
	After a few minutes they got to school and then Dustin asked Ty before he got out of the car,”Why didn’t you age yourself up and give yourself a car?”<br />
	Ty stared at him thoughtfully, “I think I will later. Anyways Have a good day sis.”<br />
	Dustin made his way to school and saw Andrew waiting by the front doors. Dustin waved to him and greeted him rather sheepishly, as he never had a boy ask him out and never wanted such before.<br />
	He soon forgot he hadn’t seen what Ty had done to his hair and decided he’ll check it out later. Andrew said, “Your look very pretty today, “ when Dustin reached him. <br />
	Dustin found himself somewhat irritated and retorted with “ Don’t I look pretty every day?”<br />
	Andrew blushed and looked down, “ Well I’ve never had the chance to say, and so I am now.”<br />
	Dustin then placed a quick peck on his cheek, “Let’s hurry up. Good thing we got bio first period. I need to stop by the bathroom real quick. Save me a seat?”<br />
	Andrew looked surprised and rather happy, “Sure!”</p>
