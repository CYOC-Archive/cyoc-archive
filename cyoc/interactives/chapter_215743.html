<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The curtains opened to reveal the stage had been arranged as it had been a month ago during the beauty pageant they held. On the stage was the winner of the pageant, who wore the red evening gown she had wore that night, along with the crown, and sash given to her naming her as that year&#39;s winner. The dress gave a generous view of her ample breasts, and hugged her curves. Her brown hair cascaded past her shoulders in wavy curls. Her name was Vanessa, and there wasn&#39;t a single person in the crowd that didn&#39;t recognize her. They all cheered as she glided across the stage in her high heels. <br />
<br />
The pageant winner was required to fulfill certain duties and make appearances at certain events that year, and Andy was able to arrange for his show to be one of the events. This had been one of the most difficult tricks to design since he felt it needed to compliment the change Zoey chose for herself. He had come up with multiple variations of what would happen next but he wasn&#39;t confident all of them matched exactly. Regardless, he continued the show and greeted Vanessa. &quot;I&#39;m glad you could join us Vanessa.&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly introduced her to Zoey. &quot;Now, I&#39;m sure you are wondering what we will be doing next. Zoey, since you already changed, I will have Vanessa be performing the main trick. We will be performing a bit of voodoo.&quot; Andy reached into his pocket and pulled out an unused balloon. &quot;Vanessa, may I have a pit of hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa fussed with her hair for a moment until she selected a single hair. Andy revealed he had some small scissors in his pocket, and cut a little piece off the end. He carefully placed the hair inside the balloon, while Natalie wheeled a helium tank on the stage. Andy placed the end of the hose connected to the tank in the balloon. &quot;Zoey, would you please hold Vanessa&#39;s hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoey reached out and tentatively held Vanessa&#39;s hand. She smiled and Zoey and whispered. &quot;Don&#39;t be so nervous. I&#39;m the one he&#39;s doing a trick on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, unlike the other assistants, Vanessa had actually rehearsed with them and experienced all of the possible changes already. This meant that Jenny only had to redo changes. This was convenient since some of the changes were somewhat convoluted to achieve the desired effect.<br />
<br />
Andy turned the nozzle, and as the balloon inflated,  Vanessa&#39;s body began to rise as if she was also filled with helium. Her body rotated as Zoey kept her arm anchored. Soon her body was horizontal, and then her as her feet kept floating upwards, she was quickly finding herself upside down. Vanessa uses her free hand to keep her dress from sliding up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zoey, you can let her go now.&quot; Andy instructed. As she let go, Vanessa floated higher. The audience watched as she rose higher and higher.<br />
<br />
Andy rotated the balloon,  and as she did her body was once again horizontal. He beckoned Zoey over. &quot;Like a voodoo doll, she will move with the balloon. Give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoey moved the balloon around, and Vanessa followed. To the left, to the right, up, down, forward and backwards. She spun the balloon, and Vanessa spun above her.<br />
<br />
The audience cheered as they watched Vanessa spinning, her hair trailing behind her. Zoey then turned the balloon and different way, watching Vanessa, who appeared to be laying on her side on some invisible force, now turned so she was on her back. Zoey kept turning the balloon until Vanessa now appeared to be laying on her stomach. Vanessa smiled down at her as her hair dangled below her, obscuring her face from the audience.<br />
<br />
Zoey was only vaguely aware of Andy handing her someone. She casually looked at it and then did a double take. In her hands was a pin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you know what to do with that.&quot; Andy told her. Zoey looked up at the still smiling face of Vanessa who nodded encouragingly. <br />
<br />
Never taking her eyes off of Vanessa, Zoey slowly moved the pin towards the balloon. The audience held their breath unsure of what would happen next. A drum roll played over the speaker system.<br />
<br />
As the pin pierced the balloon&#39;s thin rubber shell, Zoey was forced to blink by the sound of a loud pop. When she opened her eyes, her vision was once again obscured by Vanessa&#39;s dress landing directly on her face.<br />
<br />
From the audience viewpoint, mostly from those not close enough to the front so the pop didn&#39;t seem so loud, Vanessa suddenly exploded into confetti which rained down. She left behind her clothes which no longer floated, freed from the helium effect Vanessa was experiencing. <br />
<br />
Of course Andy knew Vanessa hadn&#39;t exploded. Rather, Jenny had changed her into confetti. Their first attempt in rehearsal ended with the paper falling down in a ball. It took a few tried before they realized that they had to also turn her partially into compressed air to get the effect they wanted.<br />
<br />
The undo button would set her right later. Natalie quickly swept the remains of Vanessa up and took the dress from Zoey. She tried to discreetly pick up Vanessa&#39;s panties but she was sure someone had seen them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Zoey for helping us with our show. Ladies and gentlemen, please give her a hand.&quot; Andy took the crown and sash. &quot;If you could do me one more favor, hold onto these until Vanessa can take them back.&quot; He placed the beauty pageant winner paraphernalia on the former boy and sent her back to her seat.</p>
