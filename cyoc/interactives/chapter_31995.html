<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy left the store, placing the bottle in his pocket. He remembered he had to get to his friend's cabin. It was two hours away, just at the edge of the city. He quickly got to his apartment and packed. He got loads of food, a few changes of clothes and such. He was particularly excited because he was meeting a friend of his, Raiden. They kind of lost contact after Raiden switched schools and just found each other a few weeks back. This was more or less a 'catch-up' vacation for the two. <br />
<br />
Guy was now on his way, just driving as fast as he could down the high way. Which soon turned off into a street, then onto a narrow dirt road. (Wow! Two hours just seem to fly by!) Guy noticed Raiden wasn't there, but there was a key under a potted plant, just as he had said. Guy let him self in, stored the food, placed his suitcase in a room and just relaxed on the couch. This cabin was quaint yet fairly sized, it was easily bigger than Guy's apartment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... I guess he really is well off...&quot; Guy thought aloud as he skimmed the walls with his eyes. &quot;He really changed though...&quot; Guy added, remembering old-Raiden and the new-Raiden.<br />
<br />
Old-Raiden had been a squaty-fat-kid with buzzed down brown hair. He had head gear for his horrible teeth. Being British with the full-blown accent didn't help him at all either. His hazel eyes were very attractive, at the least... Which then made Guy think of his old scrawny self. They were always picked on back during that Freshman year... Which explains why Guy decided to get so big over the years. Though after freshman year, Raiden moved away. The abuse was just too much for his lil-sensitive self to take.<br />
<br />
Then there was Raiden now, who was a male model of sorts. Yeah, talk about ironic. He was now much taller, about 6'2. He was no longer fat, though he wasn't like Guy either. He was built for perfect definition, not for size. His torso was just so perfectly chiseled, it could put those famous Greece-Sculptures to shame. His hair was now mid back length and was a bit disheveled. Which just framed those killer eyes of his perfectly. His smile was perfect. It wasn't too broad, nor was it overly-bleach white. Guy got these nice little images from all the pictures he seen in magazines. He never would of guessed that was Raiden! <br />
<br />
With those thoughts brewing around for entertainment, the vile must of got a bit jealous. Since it was now vibrating, insinuating that it was ready for ingestion. &quot;Looks like it's ready and Raiden should be an hour or so away&quot; Guy said. &quot;Heh, I guess at least one of us won't be as smooth as glass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy went to the bathroom in his room. He kept the bedroom door open and just shut the bathroom one instead. He drank the contents of the vile... It was... vile! Guy gagged as the liquid slowly made its way down his throat. Then the sensation just stopped... As if his body absorbed it before hand. Then Guy felt another sensation. The sensation of... nothing! Guy looked himself over in the full length mirror. Then he peeled off all his clothes and checked again. There stood a stunning body, with a moderately handsome face that was charmed with those emerald green eyes... But still smoother and hairless than a newborn baby...<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft...&quot; Guy sneered, followed by a cough. &quot;How anti-climatic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Though Guy did feel a bit sleepy, probably from the disappointment. All he wanted was a nice goatee and a nice sheet of hair all over his body. He pulled up his black boxer briefs and jumped up onto his bed, curling up in the blankets. Guy should of looked closer... He would of noticed his canine teeth were unusually long... And his nails were a bit longer and darker as well...<br />
<br />
While he slept, his mass began to twitch. A thin sheet of hair spread over his body... With each twitch the hair grew longer and longer. It was more like blond fur than hair. His teeth incisor teeth sharpened, his nails followed in suit. Then his bulky mass began to condense. His chest thinning out along with his torso. His spine and ribs cracking to adjust to a new frame. His tail bone now producing a fluffy tail. He looked more like a tamed wolf with gleaming green eyes. But the teeth and claws said otherwise, they looked like they could tear the guys down at the gym in half!<br />
<br />
Guy didn't notice these changes, he was still asleep. And he was still sleeping an hour after the changes had occurred...<br />
<br />
&quot;Guy? Have you arrived yet?&quot; A voice rang out from downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... Huh?&quot; Guy muttered as he tried to rub his eyes. Only to see paws 'n claws. &quot;What the!?&quot; Guy cried. He thought he was having a horrible nightmare. But this felt too real. And he knew what Mr. Yaun's potions could do... At least he could still talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Leave it to Guy to be dozing off already. You were always such a lazy bum!&quot; Raiden jested as he began to climb up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't let him see me...&quot; Guy thought as he began to panic.</p>
