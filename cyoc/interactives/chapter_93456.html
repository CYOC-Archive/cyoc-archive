<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…trigger our own transformations into werewolves, and break free of our ropes!”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Let’s better get passionate rather quickly, I’m afraid. Hopefully, we both have an animal side to call upon now! And since our hands are bound, we’d better start by… Eek! What’s that?”<br />
<br />
Karl heard it at the same time. A squeaking from behind an old assortment of paint cans at one side of the basement. “Mice – or rats,” he reasoned.<br />
<br />
Alice’s eyes went wide behind her spectacles. Karl sighed, Alice was prettified of rodents. Before they could spoil the mood entirely, Karl leaned forward and carefully nipped Alice’s ear repeatedly – hoping that their practiced pretense play at being werewolves would result in them turning into the real deal, thanks to Sally’s lupine saliva in their bloodstreams. Karl then nuzzled the side of her soft face, and Alice sighed with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Distracted from her fear of the nearby rodents, Alice angled her head to gently bite Karl’s ear in return before rubbing her nose along his neck. She growled playfully, and soon her boyfriend responded in kind. They kissed – softly at first, and then more passionately, with their tongues touching. They began to feel hotter, their blood pumping faster. Moments later, Karl and Alice felt their bones aching, and then stretching. Ignoring the discomfort, they continued their dog-like exchange of affection – the tips of their tongues now licking each other’s mouths.<br />
<br />
Karl’s muscles flexed. The rope cords gave a little. “Don’t stop – keep going, Alice!” he urged her. Straining his cords further, Karl painfully began to ease one wrist - then his hand - through the gap he was creating by his efforts to break free. Squeezing his eyes shut, he choked back a scream. At the same time his nose and face felt that Alice’s cheeks were no longer smooth. He could detect prickling…<br />
<br />
Shooting his eyes open, Karl saw that his beloved was entering the change. Hairs were emerging all over her face. He too could now feel his skin itching all over, as hairs sprouted from his pores. His heart pounded faster still, and he could smell subtle changes in Alice’s scent as his senses sharpened. He could detect… Excitement? How I know what excitement smells like? He asked himself. But the wolf awakening in him knew, he realized.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his hand was free. Ignoring the surface bleeding, Karl freed his other hand – then used his sharpening fingernails to cut into the ropes binding Alice’s hands together. Pausing to lick clean her boyfriend’s wrist, Alice next raised her bound hands to her mouth, and she gnawed at the now-frayed rope with the fangs that her teeth were lengthening into. Seconds later, she had broken through.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Now we can really get to work…” Alice lovingly brushed the fur that was forming on Karl’s face, and then saw her own fore claws and hairy forearms. She raised her hands to her face, and felt the short fur emerging there. She touched her nose as it started to turn black and leathery. “I-I’m not immune, after all! I really am becoming…a werewolf. We both are…,” she whispered in awe.<br />
<br />
“Yes. We’ll both join Sally as members of the werewolf race – and we’ll do it together, Alice! Let’s finish the job.” Karl tried to smile back, but then his jaw and nose were starting to stretch forward.<br />
<br />
“Yes, together…always, Karl,” Alice sighed, remembering their private vow that they made when they fell in love. She grinned wolfishly. &quot;You’re going to be a sexy wolf man, after I’ve worked my magic on you.” She and Karl hurriedly undressed each other, their bodies contorting as their bodies and muscles shifted underneath the rolling waves of fur now sweeping across their skins. Pulling off most of their clothes before they could get damaged, Karl felt his socks rip as his feet morphed into a half-lupine form. His toenails burst through the cotton, turning into hind claws. Alice’s feet changed at the same time – and they impatiently used the clawed thumbs and stunted fingers on their hands to tear and shred the remaining material of both their socks and their underwear. Karl quickly eased his erect member into Alice’s vulva before his budding sheath could form – and the panting lovers maneuvered themselves so that their bodies locked together, taking turns to be on top. Finding it now impossible to kiss with their lips, the lovers instead resumed ear-nipping with their fangs, as their furred muzzles stretched into position. Seeing Alice’s eyes turn yellow just before his own eyesight faded to black and white, Karl swiftly removed his girlfriend’s glasses and placed them to one side – allowing her pointed ears to rise to the top of her head, in tandem with Karl’s. He rubbed, then licked, Alice’s now smaller breasts and teats - warm underneath her luscious pelt of ginger-brown fur.<br />
<br />
They managed to climax together. Both aware of the need to avoid alerting Roxanne and Kevin to what was happening in the cellar – Karl and Alice held each other tightly as their transformations became complete, stifling the instinct to howl with joy. Their tails burst forth from above their rears – the bottoms of the spines straightening, lengthening, and becoming furred. The final adjustments to their faces, skeletons and body structures fell into place, and the couple panted – mouth whiskers and lupine ears twitching. <br />
<br />
Alice and Karl separated themselves. They both saw Karl’s sheath take shape, to hide away his malehood. As one, they turned, growling – sprinting after the panicking pair of rats trapped behind the paint cans. Crushing them in their forepaws, the new werewolves fed on a rat each, taking the edge of the hunger that they felt as an aftermath of the change.<br />
<br />
“You…no…longer…scared…of rats?” Karl growled, remembering how Sally broke down her words when talking in her half-lupine form.<br />
<br />
“No. They…scared…of me…, now!” Alice grinned, as they licked away the last of the blood around their mouths. They turned to face the cracked full-length mirror that had been dumped in the cellar, to see themselves as the newborn, bipedal wolf man and wolf woman that they now were. Still the same size, but standing a little taller (and comfortably) on their digitigrade legs, they were a perfect mixture between humans and wolves. Karl noticed that their hands and wrists had healed.<br />
<br />
“You…are…beautiful!” Karl nuzzled the fully-lupine head of his mate, and teasingly stroked her tail, as he drank in her scent and emotions. In turn, she rubbed her half-paws across his light-brown fur, feeling the taut chest muscles and abs, and the wild strength within them.<br />
<br />
She growled in kind. “Thank…you. I’m now…a British werewolf…in the U…S…A. And you…are gorgeous too…, Karl!”<br />
<br />
Their admiration of each other was broken by the howling from upstairs. Roxanne and Kevin had completed their own mating and transformations. They would soon head back to the cellar, in order to feast on their ‘human’ prisoners. <br />
<br />
Racing up the stairs, Alice and Karl discovered that the cellar door was locked. They could break it down with their increased strength and fight the rogue werewolf couple in the house. Alternatively, the small window at the top of the far cellar wall was the only other possible exit. They looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“What should…we do?” Alice growled at her mate.</p>
