<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey made it through the portal to land in the domain of the vampires. She was surprised not to see her mother waiting for her, but rather Lancelot again. &#39;Nice,&#39; Hailey thought to herself. &#39;....my mom is obviously trying to set me up with this guy.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings again, Hailey, and I suppose I should say....is it Merry Christmas or Happy Christmas these days? Honestly I hadn&#39;t celebrated the holiday until my lord and lady decided that our people needed to feel merry this time of year.&quot; Lancelot said as Hailey walked out of the lab where the teleporter back to S.P.E.A.R. was located, she walked outside to see that the Tepes vampire domain looked rather festive than the last time she had been here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly I wasn&#39;t even sure I would have a merry Christmas this year considering all the crap I&#39;ve been through. My mom and me getting turned into vampires, getting recruited into a secret government operation, having to live on the other side of the world away from my mom, and getting my ass kicked several times or having some damn spell make me act like a total bimbo. Can you imagine going through such crap?&quot; Hailey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly can, I have lived through much hardships in my years on this earth.&quot; Lancelot said as she noticed several vampires kissing underneath a mistletoe and looking at Lancelot and beginning to feel a kinship and blushed a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I asked you before, you&#39;re not THAT Lancelot, right? King Arthur and all those guys?&quot; Hailey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you Hailey, I am he who you speak of. I lived through Arthur&#39;s reign, I was the instigator of his fall, and spent years looking for penance for my actions. I became employed in Lord Wyatt&#39;s father for a time, before I...faltered and he too punished me for my actions. Then I spent more years away from the world, until Lord Wyatt himself welcomed me back.&quot; Lancelot quickly explained as they approached Tepes Manor.<br />
<br />
Hailey noticed to one side of her saw Cassandra and Duchess entangled with each other as Duchess giggled while Cassandra smirked. &quot;Oh, mistress, please...we really should reconvene in your chambers.&quot; Duchess suggested. &quot;Oh, very well Duchess. But follow in behind me slowly so you may see my figure as I change into something more...alluring.&quot; Cassandra said as she pinched Duchess&#39;s ass. &quot;Of course, my mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know that the vampires were in such a festive mood this year. Did something change the lord and lady&#39;s minds?&quot; Hailey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It actually happened not too long after your last visit. Lord Wyatt and I went out to find a new group of vampires that had popped up several towns away from here. They seemed more interested in partying than anything else. Lord Wyatt asked to see the vampire who sired them and was taken aback by what he found....&quot; Lancelot explained.<br />
<br />
**********************************************************<br />
<br />
Lord Wyatt made his way to the back yard of a house where on a swing set, a girl of about seven was swinging back and forth. She looked up and nodded towards him. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a big vampire boss.&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am, I&#39;m Lord Wyatt, you&#39;re the one who sired all these people?&quot; Wyatt asked the girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am, my parents barely paid any attention to me before and when I came back from camp, I had been bitten by a vampire, then I turned my parents into vampires so they could play more with me, but they&#39;re not interested in playing with me. All they wanted was people their own age to party with and I&#39;m still ignored. I thought living as a vampire would be fun, but it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve been like this for two weeks and I don&#39;t want to be like this anymore. I just wanted my mommy and daddy to see me as a person. Are you a daddy?&quot; The girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....I am. I have Three boys and two girls. They&#39;ll grow up normally but I&#39;ll grow slower compared to them.&quot; Wyatt answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you&#39;ll be a good daddy. But I don&#39;t want to have my parents anymore....and I don&#39;t want this life anymore.&quot; The girl said as she fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you end it for me?&quot; The girl asked. &quot;I can if you want to.&quot; Wyatt replied. The girl got off the swing and wing to hug Wyatt, as the girl hugged Wyatt, he closed his eyes and she felt a slight pain in her chest as smiled through her pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Were the girl&#39;s last words before she crumbled to dust. <br />
<br />
Wyatt then went to tell the girl&#39;s parents, but they hardly seemed to care. Wyatt felt a fury in him that must&#39;ve been how his half brother felt once as he raged at all the party goers and vampires and slaughtered those who thought it was fun to party while a girl was dead.<br />
<br />
Once Wyatt was done, he realized he never even got the girl&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we returned, Lord Wyatt decided that his children should have a holiday celebration like any children. He also vowed to never think any different of his own children. Lord Wyatt and Lady Kyra may be cruel to their enemies, but they are ever kind in their way to their children.&quot; Lancelot finished.<br />
<br />
They finally approached a hallway, where Cheyenne came into view. &quot;Mom!&quot; Hailey said happily as she went to embrace her mother in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll leave you two alone.&quot; Lancelot said. &quot;Nonsense, come on in Lancelot, I want you to get a closer look at our lord and lady&#39;s children too.&quot; Cheyenne said.<br />
<br />
Cheyenne, Hailey, and Lancelot all went to the nursery where the children were held but stopped by little Ann who looked to growl at Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Ann, it&#39;s alright, she&#39;s my daughter.&quot; Cheyenne said as Ann looked back from Cheyenne to Hailey and nodded as she left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that. Little Ann is very fierce as I told you in my letter and very protective of our lord&#39;s children.&quot; Cheyenne said as they entered the nursery where Wyatt and Kyra were holding two of their children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, young Hailey, welcome back. Visiting family, I see.&quot; Lady Kyra said as she held her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hailey, let me introduce you to the vampires princes, and princesses. This is Andrew, Brendan, and Lord Wyatt is holding Duncan. Here are our princesses, Lady Kyra is holding Andromeda and this sleeping little babe is Nyx.&quot; Cheyenne said as she gently picked up baby Nyx and handed her to Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I don&#39;t think....&quot; Cheyenne shook her head and showed her how to hold the baby. Hailey looked at baby Nyx surprised at how adorable a baby vampire could be or  dhampir as they were known.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re all beautiful, my lord and lady. When they come of age, I will teach them survival training.&quot; Lancelot said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will indeed Lancelot. For now, I want to enjoy all my little moments with them.&quot; Lord Wyatt said as he looked over at Lancelot and Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems Cheyenne has stuck you two under the mistletoe.&quot; Wyatt said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Hailey and Lancelot looked up a little surprised. Hailey turned to face Lancelot who wasn&#39;t looking back at her and kissed him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merry Christmas, Lancelot.&quot; Hailey said. &quot;Happy Christmas to you as well...&quot; Lancelot then went to kiss Hailey on the cheek, but she turned her face at the last second by mistake and kissed Lancelot on the lips and both blushed. &quot;Uh...happy Christmas, Hailey.&quot;</p>
