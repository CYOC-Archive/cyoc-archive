<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Did you have to turn them into pigs though?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else wold I turn the into?&quot; Red asked in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could have changed them into girls&quot; you said. &quot;Though I bet you couldn't do that. You took that potion from your grandmother. I even bet that you didn't know what it did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right on one thing&quot; Red said. &quot;I did take that potion from my grandmother's cupboard. You're wrong that I didn't know what it did though. I wanted to punish those boys and I'm not strong enough to turn someone into an animal with one of my potions. Though I am strong enough to change someone's age and sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you can't&quot; you said feeling a little more confident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; Red said with a smile on her face. &quot;If I can turn you into an eleven year old girl you agree to become my twin sister. If I can't then I'll turn those two pigs back into boys. Though I'll have to go home and get another of Granma's potions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fair&quot; you said. You really didn't think this girl could do something like that.<br />
<br />
Red reached into another pocket and brought out a small vial filled with a red liquid. She handed it to you and said &quot;Drink this then you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged and opened the vial. There was barely a swallow in it so you just downed it. Whatever it was tasted like strawberry and bananas. &quot;That tasted pretty good&quot; you said not noticing anything. &quot;Though it didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it will&quot; Red said. &quot;It just takes a little longer than Granma's. Now then, what shall we call you? You'll need a new name after you become my twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think that I will be&quot; you said. &quot;I think it's time for you to go home and get another of your grandmother's potions so you can change those boys back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I win the bet&quot; Red said as you start to feel a tingling sensation throughout your body. &quot;The potion's working now. Feel your skin if you doubt me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't believe that she's telling the truth but you decide to humor her. You reach your hand up to your face and are surprised that it's soft and smooth. You should have some stubble on your cheeks but there isn't. &quot;What the...?&quot; you begin to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that the potion is working&quot; Red said. &quot;You'll experience some discomfort as the change happens. It shouldn't be anything like those boys went through though so don't worry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were mentally kicking yourself for making such a stupid bet. You should have known that she might have a potion to do this to you. Suddenly your stomach cramps painfully and you double over holding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be your insides rearranging themselves to accommodate your new womb&quot; Red said. &quot;It should pass in a moment or two. When they do go ahead and check to see if you still have a penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a couple moments before the cramps disappeared. Once they did you stood back up. &quot;Give me a second ok&quot; you said as you turned around. You pulled out the waistband of your jeans and briefs as far as you could. It wasn't far but it was enough to confirm that you no longer had a penis. Turning back around you said &quot;Well... it looks like I'm going to be... to be... to be your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you are&quot; Red said. &quot;If you accept a deal with a witch then you have to see it through. Otherwise there could be some unpleasant consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tingling in your body intensified and your clothes became a bit looser on you than they were before. You looked at your body and saw that it had become slimmer. The tingling intensified around your chest and you were waiting for breasts to pop out. They never did as the tingling intensified in your scalp. You figured that your hair was growing longer. Your face tingled more and you knew that it was becoming more like a girl's face. Finally the tingling intensified all over your body again and you started to shrink. You went from your normal six foot to five foot nine, five foot eight, five foot seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, five foot. By this time your clothes had become loose on you and your pants and briefs slid down to your ankles. Fortunately your shirt was long enough now to cover your privates. You continued to shrink, four foot eleven, ten, nine, eight, until you were four foot seven. You were now the same height as Red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like the transformation is complete sis&quot; Red says as the tingling leaves your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's my new name?&quot; you asked resigned to being Red's sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should let Mom decide that&quot; Red said. &quot;Since you're my sister now I'll let you call me Becky. Everyone in my family does so you should too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about never calling you Becky?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's only for non-family members&quot; Red said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it seemed like you hated it&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't hate it&quot; Becky said. &quot;I just like other people to know me by a more unique name. Becky is all too common after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I can call you Becky?&quot; you asked unsure about it. You didn't want her mad at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you can now&quot; Becky said. &quot;Though don't encourage others to call me that. I'll be mad at them and at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll remember that&quot; you said giggling a little. You were shocked that you giggled like a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and the potion also changed some of your non-visible characteristics&quot; Becky said. &quot;We need to get home. Just leave your clothes here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't want anyone seeing me naked&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Becky sad. &quot;Those other two boys could still be around but I doubt it. Though there could be other boys around. You won't be able to walk in your shoes and your socks could trip you up. Your pants and underwear will likely trip you up too. The only thing you'll be able to keep on is your shirt. Though you might want to hold it up on you. It looks like it's about to fall off of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You realized that she was right and so crossed your arms to keep it up. It came down to your knees now so you wouldn't have to worry about anyone getting a look at your privates. As you fold your arms you feel two slight bumps on your chest. You guess that you had some breasts after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me&quot; Becky said. &quot;Stay close to me. You can easily get lost between here and the house if you don't know where you're going. We better hurry too. It's starting to get late and there are things that come out at night around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what type of th-things?&quot; you asked starting to get scared now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've heard Granma say there were werewolves around here&quot; Becky said. &quot;I've seen some shadows from my window at night. I don't know if they were werewolves or just boys trying to get a look at me but I saw them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than likely it was boys&quot; you said more to convince yourself then to convince Becky. &quot;Werewolves don't exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you have said magic didn't exist before today?&quot; Becky asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yeah&quot; you said not liking where this was going to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then consider the possibility of werewolves existing&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we should get going then&quot; you said a note of fear in your voice. You knew that Becky's argument that you should consider the possibility of there being werewolves was valid. Before today you would have said that all magic was was a bunch of cheap tricks. Now feeling the two slight bumps on your chest and the slight gust of wind up your shirt cooling your new female organs, you knew that there was magic. If you needed further proof you just had to look at the two pigs that where once boys, pieces of their clothes still hanging off of them.<br />
<br />
Becky starts down a path and you follow wondering if you would make it to your new home or if you would meet some type of creature.</p>
