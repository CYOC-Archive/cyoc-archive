<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the first rays of sunlight peeking through blinds warmed her face, Marina felt... complete.<br />
<br />
She let out a contented sigh as she stirred into awareness, still curled up atop Adrian&#39;s nude body. There was still an afterglow from their intimacy the previous night that seemed to be coursing through her, a certain sort of pleasant tingle that stemmed from every moment her webbed hands were drawn across his taut muscles. The shock of the previous day, the exhaustion, the confusion at what she&#39;d become, it all seemed to have melted away, replaced by a sense of odd belonging. It was as if... everything that had happened, bizarre as it all had been, was meant to be. That it had been worthwhile to bring her here.<br />
<br />
Her tail curled as she stretched her upper body, and when she glanced down past her long locks of teal hair, she spotted something sparkling in the morning sun. Scales, a lighter blue color than the skin of her tail had been, now sprouted from her waistline down to a slightly larger, thinner, and more intricate fin. She had well and truly progressed from a latex-skinned mermaid to one that that still shined just as brightly, her beautiful tail glinting and pleasant to the touch. Part of her wondered if the passion she&#39;d shared with Adrian had been some key, a final element that had pushed her transformation to be completed as she slept within his embrace.<br />
<br />
Glancing down to the medallion that hung near her chest - which seemed just so slightly larger this morning - Marina couldn&#39;t help but wonder if, perhaps, her discovery of this mystical piece of jewelry had been a blessing in disguise. She had never before felt as wonderful, as certain of her place in the world, as she felt right now. Certainly, she&#39;d never enjoyed a sexual encounter quite so exciting, so thoroughly pleasurable, as what she&#39;d shared with the man breathing lightly under her. In a way, she was even thankful. What she had become was far more beautiful than anything she could have become when she was human.<br />
<br />
Yes... the medallion and its changes had been a gift. One that was only fully secured thanks to Adrian... and for that, she decided, he deserved a gift in return.<br />
<br />
There was a hint of trepidation as she slowly removed the medallion from around her neck. Not from the possibility that its removal would return her humanity... quite the contrary, in fact. She was terrified as it finally was pulled away from her body that, without this incredible artifact, all the wonderful sensations of her tail, her sensitive bosom, the webbing between her fingers, all of it would vanish away as soon as it was gone. But after a few moments with the medallion removed, she felt nothing change, and a silent sigh of relief passed her lips. She wanted this, this body, this feeling of happiness. And she wanted to share it.<br />
<br />
Adrian was just stirring to awareness as she lowered the medallion down to his chest, pulling the chain over his head. He seemed confused, uncertain of what was occurring, until a glow from the golden artifact sent a warmth pulsing through his entire body. She reached behind his head, cradling him and smiling brightly, her eyes conveying everything he needed to know without any need for words to be shared between them. She could sense his fear, his concern for the unknown as the medallion began to work at changing his physical form, but their lips locked into a kiss to restore his spirits.<br />
<br />
She had moved a hand to his legs, expecting the first change to take the form of them merging together. Instead, the first thing she felt changing were the lips that her own had been crushed against. They plumped out, swelling to a more feminine shape and size; the hand upon his legs quickly trailed up to his hips, and found that while there remained the considerable muscle he had spent so long a time building up remained, the overall shape of his lower body was becoming a bit softer, a bit... curvier.<br />
<br />
That same hand rushed to between his thighs just in time to feel the rod that had filled her the previous night sinking away within him, the hole at the end spreading and reshaping into a slit. Adrian was most certainly aware of what was happening, but as her hands entwined with the lengthening dark hair of her lover, she realized the dockmaster was offering no resistance. Thus, Marina found herself doing what she could to enhance the pleasure of this change in gender, a pair of fingers slipping within the newly-formed entrance, basking in the warmth and the soaking wetness. A pair of yet-strong arms, more slender yet retaining a great deal of muscle, wrapped around her back, pulling the mermaid in tight as Adrian&#39;s breasts swelled to a size comparable to her own, mounds of sensitive flesh rubbing against each other and drawing out high-pitched moans of delight.<br />
<br />
She broke their kiss briefly, simply so that she could pull her face away and open her eyes for a view of Adrian&#39;s face. Before, the dockmaster had featured a handsome visage, a powerful jawline and a sharp gaze; in many ways, her new face retained the qualities of power and keenness, but in a much more feminine shape. She was gorgeous, with bright eyes that seemed to bore directly into Marina&#39;s face. The newly-minted woman&#39;s gaze seemed to ask a question, and the affection in her own look served as an answer that put a bright smile onto Adrian&#39;s thick, welcoming lips, before said lips were once again pressed to Marina&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Her tail instinctively wrapped around the woman&#39;s legs as the next step in the process began. Between the fingers tracing over her back, Marina felt webbing grow, a thin membrane perfect for underwater navigation quickly becoming a mainstay feature of Adrian&#39;s hands. She only began to let out truly excited moans, however, as her legs pulled together, the flesh melting into itself, bones becoming flexible cartilage that was reshaping itself to a more useful shape. Her feet splayed out, spreading into a wide triangular shape... a fin, placed at the end of a long, single, tapering limb. The pigmentation of the skin was changing as the tail lengthened, becoming a deep crimson color, contrasting beautifully with the light blue scales of Marina&#39;s own tail. Her own tail was thicker than Marina&#39;s, too; her entire body was still athletic, bordering on amazonian in its strength, and a great deal more in raw, muscular strength was available within her new tail.<br />
<br />
She pulled away once more as the glow of the medallion faded, Adrian&#39;s transformations settling for now. Something within Marina was certain that if they continued, if she blessed this newly-created mermaid with her first orgasm as a beautiful woman, then the changes would be completed for her as they had been completed for Marina. Perhaps there was still time to remove the medallion, and in doing so allow the dockmaster to revert to what she had once been... but as her heart pounded, gaze locked with Adrian beneath her, she begged and pleaded and prayed within her mind that her lover would accept a complete and permanent transformation just as she had.</p>
