<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan read the sentence and thought of just replacing Stephanie’s name with her own but decided against it. She didn’t necessarily what to be one of the most popular people in school plus she had no idea what she would be made popular for. She thought to change Stephanie back to a guy but decided against that as well. The change might break the two up but it could also cause Laura to become straight again, on top of that she liked the new Stephanie. Megan preferred the new Laura but would be sad to see the buff sexy female athlete go. <br />
<br />
Megan was thinking about generating a new sentence when she decided to try and switch Laura and her own name in the sentence. Her thought was that the change might cause Stephanie’s and Laura’s relationship to either disappear or for it to become more open allowing her to get with both Stephanie and Laura.<br />
<br />
Making the change she looked up from her phone. Where there had once been a nervous Stephanie and Laura being found dating behind Megan’s back now stood a quiet Laura trying to suppress a smile and a laughing Stephanie who must have just made a joke. The sight surprised Megan by how normal it looked and felt. She then didn’t know what to do as Stephanie walked over to her and leaned down to kiss her on the forehead. <br />
<br />
“Sorry Megan I’m just nervous. When is Chloe going to get here I can’t stand waiting” said Stephanie as she began looking over the crowds in the mall to see if she could find Chloe. Her previously jovial tone broke away to one that tried its best but failed in hiding her nervousness.<br />
<br />
“Calm down. Chloe said she just parked and it’s going to take her a few minutes to walk here” said Laura as she walked up to Stephanie and placed a hand on Stephanie’s arm. The gesture seemed to comfort Stephanie and she placed one of her own hands over Laura’s. <br />
<br />
Megan was confused as to what was happening or going to happen that made Stephanie one of the most confident persons in her school to be this nervous. When the memories of this reality hit her, she blushed a deep red knowing why. <br />
<br />
This reality had seen both of the couples between (Megan & Chloe) and (Laura & Stephanie) being outed at the same time when they had run into each other while both out on dates. The reveal had gone surprisingly smoothly for the two couples with no one begrudging another for the secret. Near the end of the reveal Megan had joked that they would have to have separate movie nights with the couples or else it might lead to a foursome which they couldn’t do. Laura the pragmatic goth asked why they couldn’t have a foursome and when nobody offered a reason she actually scheduled for the couples to get together and a do it. Today had been the day Laura had planned for and after going to a lingerie store to try stuff on they were going to Stephanie’s house to have their first foursome.<br />
<br />
This was better than Megan could have hoped for, she was not only going to get intimate with Stephanie and Laura but she was also going to have her girlfriend Chloe alongside her for the whole experience. The thought of what was going to happen later saw Megan start feeling just as nervous as Stephanie sounded. <br />
<br />
Megan nearly jumped out of her clothes when Chloe snuck up beside her and put her hand on Megan’s shoulder. The other two noticed and greeted Chloe as Megan got angry at her for scaring her. With the four of them together now they made their way to the lingerie store as they planned. When they made it to the store Laura had the idea that each of them should first find one set of lingerie to have a surprise fashion show with before they got to their real shopping. The four split up to find their selection and met back up in the changing rooms to do their show. Because it was her idea Laura went first entering a room to change then exiting wearing only her chosen piece. <br />
<br />
Laura’s was a black set with lots of straps and lace. It fit her goth vibe perfectly and made her thicc curves standout even more than normal.  Laura did a quick display for the other girls then sat on Stephanie’s lap while Chloe went for her turn. <br />
<br />
Chloe came back wearing a simple dark red set that showed off her lean athletic body. Her display was more elaborate than Laura’s as she turned and shook around almost dancing. Chloe finished and sat next to Megan as Stephanie had to lift Laura off her lap to go for her turn.<br />
<br />
Stephanie came out blushing deeply in a pure white set that had lace detailing. Her display was short and she quickly sat back down where Laura hopped back into her lap. <br />
<br />
It was Megan’s turn and Chloe wished her luck as she went to change. Inside the changing room Megan ran into a little problem, she had found a set of lingerie that had matched her skin tone very closely and if wore right could make her nude. The problem was that in her hurry she had gotten it in a size too small and was having trouble fitting. Megan managed to Get the set on but the tight fit ruined the impression it was supposed to give. Before She left the room to show it off anyways she remembered she had brought her phone and could use the app. Targeting herself she got the sentence <br />
<br />
“Megan’s lingerie fits tightly over her modest breasts”</p>
