<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Standing outside of the ship, you look at the massive vessel in awe, completely 
astounded by how something that massively impressive could even be built. You 
remember though, that even back in the very beginning of large ship building, the Titanic 
was built with what could be considered prehistoric by todays standards. Wanting to get 
aboard the ship, to start enjoying your trip and exploring the boat, you stoop down to 
grab your carry-on bags and start walking up the gangplank. As you ascend into the boat, 
you notice a few really attractive men go down the gangplank to make a second trip to get 
their things and were very happy that you talked yourself into doing this. This was the 
very first gay trip that you planned since you came out to yourself and until now, you had 
been very reserved about your homosexuality, but no longer. Several months ago, you 
decided that enough was enough and you were just going to start living your life and this 
was just the beginning.</Br>
<Br>As you walked into the ship and started into the main lobby, you passed by a few 
attractive men that looked you up and down, which you returned in quick order. Just 
looking around you, watching what was going on and the people moving around, you 
already knew that this was going to be one hell of a great trip. There was so much 
potential there for you too, especially with seeing a lot of couples that could be open to a 
three-way, but several more single guys like you. Wanting to get checked in, you decide 
that it would be a good idea to stand in the line for the main desk. In front of you, you see 
a very muscular and somewhat hairy guy from what you could see of his arms and legs. 
Looking him up and down, inspecting every natural line from the definition of his muscles 
since he didn't have a shirt on, you got one hell of an erection which you hoped would go 
down because you were slightly embarrassed by it. When it was finally your turn, the guy 
in front of you turned around and you could see a lot more of that sexy piece of meat. His 
chest was well rounded, thick and powerful with a light dusting of medium brown hair, 
nice and hard nipples with a flat stomach. You were ok with that though, since you didn't 
think having a six pack was all that important anyway. There was one area that mattered a 
lot to you, which got you the label of a "size-queen", but you were ok with that too since 
you knew what you wanted and you wanted girth to fill you up in all the right ways.</Br>
<Br>With your chance to check in, you step up to the counter and the attractive desk clerk 
greets you.</Br>
<Br>"Welcome to the Pleasure Princess, where anything you would find pleasurable can 
and more than likely will happen. How can I help you sir?"</Br>
<Br>"Hi, my name is Brandon Davis and I have a trip booked here."</Br>
<Br>The clerk typed on his keyboard for a second and pulled up your reservation. "Ah, 
here you are. Now you are on board with us for at least one week, which you can increase 
at the end of the trip once we return to port here in Miami, Florida. Now, which deck would 
you like to stay on? As part of the package, everything on this ship is included and all of 
the rooms on every deck are the same price so our guests feel like they are getting the 
same experience as everyone else here."</Br>
<Br>Looking back, once you were asked that question, you lick your lips while you re-
face the clerk. "What deck was he on?" you ask sexily.</Br>
<Br>The clerk chuckled. "Yeah, I would love to get my hands on that too! He is on deck 
12 which is the sun deck, also known as the naked deck. On that deck, which is at the very 
top of the boat for special reasons, everyone is naked. No matter where you go on that 
deck, you are always naked and no one is permitted to wear clothes at all. Also, that deck 
is private, so only those who pick that deck are permitted to be there. There are special 
times where you are permitted to leave that deck, mainly for eating and experiencing our 
port of calls. So, there is a main hallway that connects all of the rooms on the outer ring, 
which is the only area where you can wear clothing. Then, there is another hallway on the 
opposite side, which is interior and gives you access to the private outside area which has 
the pool and sunning stations. There are a few restaurants, shopping stations for the 
essentials and an entertainment area. Also, every room has a very special feature that is 
only available on that deck."</Br>
<Br>Filled with excitement and anticipation to choose that room, you blurt out "What is 
that?"</Br>
<Br>The clerk looks at you wryly, slightly annoyed by your interruption since he was just 
about to tell you in the first place, but continues right where he left off. "There is a large 
sky light, almost the entire size of your ceiling to let in all of the natural light from the 
outdoors. It is especially nice at night when the moon and the stars are out because you 
are guaranteed to have a 'Howling good time'... get it?" He asked while chuckling, then 
going on to explain his pun, even though you knew what he meant. "Get it, howling good 
time, for the loud orgasms I am sure you will get. That deck is known to be the most fun, 
since you get the most cock on the boat."</Br>
<Br>"Alright, I will take a room then!" You say with eagerness.</Br>
<Br>A few more clicks on the keyboard, the clerk leans in and hands you the card with a 
large smile on his face. "There you go sir, be sure to enjoy your stay and make sure you 
have a howling good time!"</Br>
<Br>You smile as you turn and head off in the same direction as the mystery man, 
wondering where he was staying exactly. It had been a good ten minutes, or so you 
thought, and figured he was long gone by now. Although, much to your surprise, you saw 
him standing in front of the elevator and you knew you had scored a few points already. 
Wondering why he was still there, not to mention just wanting to strike up basic 
conversation, you decide to ask.</Br>
<Br>"Hi, weren't you standing in front of me in line at the main desk over there... like ten 
minutes ago?"</Br>
<Br>He looks at you, wondering where you were even going to go with this, but answers 
you nonetheless. "Yes, I was. Before I got here, there was a line of people and their bags to 
fill the four elevators here four separate times. Wouldn't you know my luck, I got stuck 
behind the lot." He said in his nice voice with a toned down Scottish accent.</Br>
<Br>"Well... at least you are going to go to your deck in a few minutes with the next 
elevator instead of waiting again." You said with a disarming smile, which he returned, 
which seemed a bit forced. "Hey, are you Scottish by the way?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, yes I am lad... why?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh, no reason. I always have thought the Scottish accent was sexy, not to mention I 
have always wanted to travel there and see the sights."</Br>
<Br>He smiled again, this time wanting to, then extended his powerful hand. "The name 
is Timothy Mc' Cullen, but my friends call me Tim."</Br>
<Br>To exchange pleasantries, not wanting to be rude, you did the same and told him 
your name. As soon as the hand shake was over, the elevator dinged and opened. With 
luck on your side, you see the whole thing was empty, which meant you both would be 
headed straight to your deck. Once you both were in the car with your carry-on luggage, 
the doors closed. Since he had a hand free, he stuck his room card in the reader and 
pushed the button for his floor.</Br>
<Br>"Hey Brandon, which floor are you on?"</Br>
<Br>"Same as you Timothy."</Br>
<Br>He looked at you with an even bigger smile, this time where you could see his nice 
and perfectly white teeth. The elevator stopped, you both looked at your room numbers 
and then at the key on the wall to point the way there.</Br>
<Br>"Hey, call me Tim... I am not much for formalities. I guess this is where we part ways 
for now. Which room are you in?"</Br>
<Br>"I am in room number... number one-eighty five. How about yourself?"</Br>
<Br>"One-twenty... which is a bit down the hall here. Well... I guess this is goodbye for at 
least a little while, since I am sure we will be seeing a lot... and I do mean a lot, of each 
other over the coming week."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I am sure we will. See you around Tim!"</Br>
<Br>You both wave as you walk toward your respective rooms. Getting to your door, while 
looking at the view through the entire wall of windows, which was honestly your only way 
to view the ocean while at sea, you stand in front of the door. Letting your bags slide 
down your arms so you can insert the key card into the door, the hit the floor with a low 
plop. Sticking the key in the door, like the instructions showed, there was a buzzing noise 
when the light turned green and the door opened automatically for you. As the door 
opened wider and wider, you eyes went wide with the sight before you.</Br></p>
