<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>JLTF&#39;s branch is amazing!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adrian grabbed the first die and rolled a three. It put him right before the outer circle, but with four different ways to leave the &#39;Furry Fun!&#39; square, he was able to choose between, &#39;Act it out,&#39; &#39;Physical Challenge,&#39; &#39;Truth or Dare,&#39; and &#39;Show What You Know.&#39; He went to the left on the board and landed on the physical challenge.<br />
<br />
He squinted his eyes in confusion. &quot;These cards were blank.&quot; Then flipped it around to show everyone. &quot;Seriously, just a minute ago these were all blank!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other guys looked at him, unsure what to say. Finn coughed into his paws, concealing a grin. The boardgame was magic, so of course they’d be blank. Jeff caught his eye and gave him a smirk and a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Isaac finally said. &quot;What&#39;s it say now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Adrian turned the card back to himself. &quot;Do 20 burpees without taking a break. For every one you do choose one of the following; an extra pound of muscle, 10% size added to your penis, a half inch in height, or 5% bigger balls. For each unsuccessful burpee, gain one pound of fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Paul started laughing.<br />
<br />
Adrian glared. &quot;I don&#39;t want to do burpees...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad big boy,&quot; Brad was chuckling to himself as well. &quot;You&#39;re the one who wanted to play the game. Go on. Play the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Adrian growled. Dave’s house was rather spacious with the living room and dining room connected. Adrian grabbed the couch and moved it off the rug so it would be out of his way, so he could actually perform the exercise. He looked back at his friends as though to ask, &#39;Do I have to,&#39; but with Paul and Brad waved him on. &quot;Alright,&quot; he clapped his hands together preparing himself for the exercise.<br />
<br />
Adrian lowered into a push up position. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said again as he went into the push up. Then to the squat and full on jumped. Luckily the ceiling was a good 20 feet in the air, or his hands would have easily run through it. He dropped back down into the squat and moved back into the push up. &quot;1.&quot; he counted.<br />
<br />
With each time he jumped, the floor shook under his weight. Being the biggest out of all of the friends except, perhaps, Dave, made it incredibly hard for him to do this kind of exercise. Sure, he&#39;d do cardio from time to time, but actually doing an exercise like this was more annoying than fun. And hearing the chuckling from Paul and Brad as the house shook under him made him all the more self-conscious. However, he powered through the best he could. However, that was only being able to get to 10.<br />
<br />
Adrian was really starting to feel gassed as he forced himself through the next repetitions. &quot;12,&quot; came out in soft huffs as he tried to stall before doing his thirteenth pushup. &quot;13,&quot; was just a bit weaker as his body was starting to shake. &quot;14. You can do it you fatass,&quot; adding the insult to make him push through. But 15 was the last one as he nearly fell over as he landed again. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he barely caught himself, then let himself fall over and lay on the ground. His belly raised and lowered at a rapid rate as he tried to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s 14 successes,&#39;&quot; Paul taunted. &quot;What are you going to spend it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian was still breathing hard but he lifted his hand to show the other guys all a single finger and finally said. &quot;All penis...&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone laughed and Brad went to help Adrian up off the floor.<br />
<br />
Paul grabbed the die and then rolled a 2. &quot;You know that physical challenge didn&#39;t look all that bad,&quot; he smiled as he moved his piece north toward a different physical challenge space. He grabbed the card and read it. &quot;10 minutes of mountain climbers. For each minute uncompleted lose 5 pounds of muscle. Upon success, gain 1 mph to your max speed along with the benefits of being able to run it for 10 minutes longer. For fucking real!? Shit... This sucks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think I feel?&quot; Adrian was still breathing fairly hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying I can&#39;t do it,&quot; Paul sneered. &quot;I just don&#39;t want to.&quot; He dropped down in position. &quot;Someone time me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad pulled out the timer on his phone. &quot;GO!&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul began the exercise. With his athletic body there was no way he was going to fail. If anything, his showboating would have been his only downfall, as he bragged about how easy it was and how he could probably complete the 20 burpees as well. His strong legs and firm ass flexed over and over as he completed the exercise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Done and done,&quot; Paul bragged as he jumped back up. He was barely even winded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel any faster?&quot; Brad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno,&quot; Paul replied. He tried jumping. &quot;I do feel a bit lighter. Maybe? Is Adrian feeling a bit fatter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off,&quot; Adrian said. As everyone looked at him, he couldn&#39;t help but adjust his shirt. &quot;Just shut up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad grabbed the die and rolled a 3. &quot;How about some truth or dare?&quot; he asked, moving his space north as well. He picked up the card. &quot;Each player will choose you to tell the truth about something or dare you to complete a task. Upon a success choose one of the following; an extra pound of muscle, 10% size added to your penis, a half inch in height, or 5% bigger balls. Upon failure challengers are allowed to choose one of the following to take; 3 pounds of muscle, a quarter inch of your penis, a half inch in height. Weird. Alright. Truth or dare?&quot; he asked Paul first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Truth. Have you actually been trying to sleep with Claire or are her friends lying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude. This again? Her friends are lying,&quot; Brad said.<br />
<br />
A loud buzzer echoed in the area. &quot;What the Hell?&quot; the group asked. They looked around, but nothing would have made that sound. And with it quiet again, all they could hear was the pitter-patter of the rain outside.<br />
<br />
However, Paul was also the first to speak up again, &quot;Looks like that&#39;s 3 pounds of muscle for me then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, come on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It&#39;s just a game,&quot; Paul shrugged. &quot;Not like any of this is real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... Sure...&quot; Brad said. However, something felt weird about his body that he couldn&#39;t quite explain. He shook it off and turned to Adrian. &quot;Alright. Truth or dare big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare. Do 20 burpees.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Brad asked. Adrian nodded. &quot;Sure man. Whatever.&quot; He dropped down and pumped out the 20 burpees without too much of a problem. Sure, he was a bit winded but after finishing them, he smiled. &quot;That&#39;s what you could do if you lost some of that weight. Eh?&quot; Adrian&#39;s arms crossed against his chest. &quot;I&#39;ll take a pound of muscle then. And you?&quot; pointing at Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Truth,&quot; Isaac said. &quot;How are you making so much money? Your tuition helps, but man, it feels like you always have a full wallet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Brad&#39;s hand went to the back of his neck, rubbing it gently. &quot;I sell pics online.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of you!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Brad smiled. &quot;Tons of gay dudes love seeing this body,&quot; he raised his arm up to flex his powerful arm. &quot;Course they want some weirder stuff sometimes but like nothing I can&#39;t do. Just like crushing stuff with my feet or whatever. I don&#39;t complain just give them a bit higher rate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know man. Like cupcakes or barbie dolls or legos or just covering my feet in mud. Shit like that,&quot; he paused. “That’s your answer. Alright…Dave, what do you have for me?”<br />
<br />
“I dare you to take off your shoes and socks.” Dave smirked.<br />
<br />
“Haha. Who the fuck are you?” Brad rolled his eyes, removing his shoes and socks and flexing his feet.<br />
<br />
“Finn’s best friend.” Dave smiled down at Finn, who grinned back happily.<br />
<br />
“And Finn is…?”<br />
<br />
“My boyfriend.” Jeff said, the tiger puffing out his chest.<br />
<br />
Finn cringed but placed a paw on the tiger’s thickly muscled leg and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what do you choose, Jeff?” Brad rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his mouth, then paused when Finn whispered something to him. His eyes widened and he began to grin. He turned his attention back to Brad.<br />
<br />
“Truth.” Jeff smirked. “Would you have sex with a guy?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Brad rolled his eyes. “No. I just post pics-”<br />
<br />
A loud buzzing sound came from the boardgame. Brad cringed and stared at it in horror.  The other guys snickered to each other.<br />
<br />
“But that’s-” Brad looked around the room, blushing. “It can’t-that’s not false!”<br />
<br />
“All take three pounds of muscle, thanks.” Jeff smirked.<br />
<br />
Again, Brad felt something weird, his body feeling…weaker, somewhat, though he felt normal a moment later. Brad shook the strangeness away and looked over at Finn.<br />
<br />
“Okay…Finn. What do you choose?”<br />
<br />
“Truth.” Finn smirked. “Since you’re at least bisexual, would you take a dick up the ass?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Brad fumed, face reddening.<br />
<br />
The buzzer went off again. Everyone looked bemusedly on as Brad started cursing and pacing around the room. Finn and Jeff exchanged knowing looks.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take three pounds of muscle.” Finn grinned.<br />
<br />
Brad wavered in his pacing, placing a hand on the wall. His tight clothes felt oddly looser than they had been before. He shook his head and sat back down, adjusting his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Finn. it&#39;s your turn,&quot; he slid the die over to Finn.<br />
<br />
Finn grinned and rolled a 2. He picked up his piece and paused, undecided on where to go. He looked around.<br />
<br />
“Avoid physical.” Adrian advised. “You’d lose.”<br />
<br />
“Truth or Dare could be fun, but…” Isaac shrugged. “We don’t really know you? They’d just be all Jeff being gay type questions, heh.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Dave pointed. “Act it Out! It’s like charades, Finn! You’re a good actor, right?”<br />
<br />
“Ummm…” Finn looked around, uncomfortable, then sighed, placing his piece on Act It Out and drawing a card. “Okay, I’ll give it a shot.”<br />
<br />
He read the card.<br />
<br />
‘Show no one. Pick an opponent. You must act out their favorite animal without using any words. If they guess correctly within the next minute, you win! If no one can figure out what you are within a minute, you lose. Winners can choose to trade the target player’s favorite animal with their own. Losers are assigned the animal guessed before the end of a minute.’<br />
<br />
Finn cocked his head, wondering which animal would be the easiest to imitate. No, wait, was it best to trade species with someone? He liked being a fox, but…they could play the game again and he could choose Fox as his favorite species again.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Jeff prompted.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I have to pantomime…something. I have one minute. If you guys can’t guess correctly by the end, I lose.” Finn said.<br />
<br />
“Alright, have you decided what you want to pantomime yet?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Ummm….” Finn looked around, then settled on Adrian. That should be pretty easy. “Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, prepare yourself.” Brad said, adjusting the timer on his phone. “Time starts in 5…4…3…2…1…go!”<br />
<br />
Finn started pantomiming snuffling around, eating berries.<br />
<br />
“Could be anything. Animal?” Adrian guessed.<br />
<br />
Finn gave him a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
“Give us some more, man!” Isaac said. “45 seconds left!’<br />
<br />
Finn realized he had to hurry. He got down on all fours, then stood on his hind legs, hands up, and mimed a roar.<br />
<br />
“Meerkat!” Brad shouted.<br />
<br />
“Kangaroo?”<br />
<br />
“Ostrich!” Dave shouted gleefully.<br />
<br />
“Ostrich?” Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s on two legs!” Dave said defensively.<br />
<br />
“Velociraptor!” Adrian guessed again. “Like from Jurassic Park!”<br />
<br />
“Squirrel!” Brad shouted.<br />
<br />
“Ground Squirrel!” Paul shouted louder, earning him a look of anger from Brad.<br />
<br />
“Armadillo!” Jeff said gleefully.<br />
<br />
Finn snorted angrily and shook his head. Jeff knew what he was trying to become and he was playing around! No help was going to be forthcoming from him.<br />
<br />
“Woodrat!” Dave said.<br />
<br />
“Mongoose?” Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
“Eagle!” Jeff shouted merrily.<br />
<br />
“Oh, wait!” Adrian shook his head, “God, I’m so stupid. It’s bear!”<br />
<br />
The buzzer sounded from the boardgame. Finn sighed and sat back down. Freakin’ idiots! Almost turned him into an eagle of all things.<br />
<br />
“I trade.” Finn smirked. “I’ll take Bear from Adrian and he can have Fox.”<br />
<br />
“Oooh~!” Jeff smirked and elbowed Finn. “Someone’s trying to get on the football team, eh? Eh?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, man! You mean I have to be a twink or something?” Adrian snorted, clearly not knowing what was in store for him.<br />
<br />
“You can be my towel boy.” Finn grinned.<br />
<br />
“My turn!” Jeff grinned and rolled the dice. <br />
<br />
6! Jeff advanced to the outer tier. He chose to land on the ‘Show what you know’ space. He cursed, one short of the tail space. Jeff was curious as to what would happen to him if he had. Being a tiger already meant that either he’d grow another tail…or nothing would happen. He grabbed the card and read it aloud.<br />
<br />
“How long has Finn been gay?” Jeff spoke, then swallowed thickly as he realized the true implications of what the card was asking. “If you answer factually, you can roll again. Incorrectly, and send your pawn back to the beginning of the game.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Adrian snorted. “He was born gay. 21 years?”<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced at Finn, who was staring at him intently. He licked his lips. What else could he do? If he answered falsely, Finn would know anyways.<br />
<br />
“Two days.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
There was a ding from the board. Finn glared at Jeff, and the tiger shrugged. Finn rolled his eyes and muttered something angrily under his breath. But…he didn’t take his phone out.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled again. 1. He advanced one space and landed on a free space. No cards drawn. He was safe. Jeff let out a sigh and passed the die to Isaac.<br />
<br />
Isaac took the die and rolled a 4. He was the second to reach the outer circle and the first to land on one of the special spaces. He chose going west and landing on the tail space. Then rolled the die again. Another four. <br />
<br />
&quot;Show what you know,&quot; he said as he grabbed the card. &quot;Where do all the missing jockstraps and equipment keep going?&quot; <br />
<br />
He paused as the other three looked at him. Everyone on the football team knew they had a thief in their mists, however, none of them could prove it. Just random days there would be someone&#39;s missing jock strap or socks or jersey. Sometimes people would notice before practice and sometimes after. No one knew, because there was never a day where at least someone was accounted for. And the thief stole from literally everyone. Including Coach Bradshaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Isaac asked as their stares became more accusatory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer the question,&quot; Brad said. He was the one who lost the most equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you curious how the card even knows this?&quot; Isaac tried to change the subject.<br />
<br />
The four jocks glared at Isaac. Each one had multiple pieces of equipment stolen and had to replace it on their own dime.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be answered later,&quot; Jeff glowered. &quot;But I&#39;m more curious about where our jocks went. They don’t grow on fucking trees, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve been selling them online...&quot; Isaac admitted. &quot;You know how people pay for pics, people also pay for equipment. So... Yeah. I&#39;ve been having Doug sneak into the locker room from time to time, open them up and then steal it. Or I take it when someone&#39;s in the shower and not paying attention. Alrig--&quot; Isaac let out a grunt as the word was interrupted by a feeling inside him. &quot;Wha--&quot; Again he couldn&#39;t finish his thought as pain rain down his spine.<br />
<br />
Isaac gripped the table with all his might as the pressure on the base of his spine grew. Every second he could feel this feeling running through his body. It was like his spine was growing longer. The pressure grew. The other three gasped as they saw an extra appendage running out of Isaac&#39;s back. It grew longer and longer as he continued to groan. It swung around wildly as golden fur started to cover it. And at the end brown fur formed into a poof at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the-- hell?&quot; Isaac panted as he felt the new appendage sway back and forth right above his real. He reached down and grabbed it. This was a part of him. He could feel it in his brain. &quot;Is this... Is this game for real!?&quot;<br />
<br />
They all stared at the board. The strangeness suddenly becoming real. What had just felt like weird choices were suddenly actually happening to them. Finn and Jeff grinned at the tail.<br />
<br />
“Your turn, Dave.” Jeff said, handing the dice to the ram.<br />
<br />
Dave stared at the lion tail extending from Isaac’s ass. “Can I change my favorite animal?”</p>
