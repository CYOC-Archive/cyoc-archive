<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda was breathing heavily as she had experienced unconceiving her no existing daughter.  After that blissful moment, new clothes appeared on her body as she got up to look at the small white pool containing Amanda&#39;s DNA that was drying up completely and leaving nothing but a clean floor.  She knew that her daughter was no more, but she seems at peace with it.<br />
<br />
Slowly getting up, she looked around to see her reflection in glass surface as the time that has her name on top was showing that she is twenty-five years of age.  Approaching the mirror, she was in awe at what she was looking at.  Before entering the room, she was nothing more then a single mother of thirty-five with a MILFy body, huge DD breasts, mature and delicate face, and spiky short hair with gray tips at the points.  But now, she was ten years younger and looked like she was back to the prime of her life before having a kid.  She has a firm, but bouncy C cups over what appears to be a lavender swimsuit bra to show off the cleavage.  Her curvy waist, trim stomach, and heart shape but fit snuggly with her Daisy Duke short shorts that was showing the lower part of the lavender swim suit.  Her arms and legs were long and toned as if she had done some swimming and outdoor like sports.  And it was evident since her skin has a bronze like tan when moments ago, she was pale and peach.  She was also completely barefoot to as she was wearing any footwear.  But it didn&#39;t matter as she was showing off her acrylic lavender toe and finger nails.  Her face was showing off a radiant and angelic look with no sign of any faint lines or wrinkles, just smooth skin.  She even have lavender lip gloss and eye liner to make her look so sultry.  And to top it all off, she short hair was now long as it goes down the middle of her back and there was a long lavender streak that goes down  to the end.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself, she remembered what her look and attire was.  Turns out, she was on Spring Break with her friends in a sorority in 2013, ten years ago.  They were in Cancun after a long study cram and were on the beach for some R&R and partying.  And with the way she was dressed, she was born and complete party animal, as gets that from her family.  With her mother being an rebellious punk rocker in the 80s and her grandmother who, from what she remembered, was a hippie in the late sixties.  She even remembered how her daughter was made.  See, one night, she was at a bar in a club drinking while the girls were dancing.  In that bar, she came across a nice Mexican guy who was fluent in Spanish.  They were hanging out at the bar, talking and drinking the night away.  But Amanda, sharing her mother&#39;s and grandmother&#39;s bad influence at a young age, had too much to drink and was a little tipsy and her body was on autopilot.  Because of that, she was getting aggressive with the man and wanted to make out with him.  This Mexican male kindly accepts that and the two went to a private room above the club for a passionate make out session.  It was an incredible experience that Amanda had ever had, so much so that she never felt like she needed protection.  But a few weeks after that night, she found out that she was pregnant when she returned home and she never got into contact with the guy.  While it was devastated, having Candy and turning her life around was the best thing that ever happened to her.<br />
<br />
Looking to herself, Amanda was amazed and said, &quot;Unbelievable!  I don&#39;t know what this room did to me, but I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m back from being the hot college girl I once was.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that the room responded from her thought and said, &quot;Of course it does.  This room can regress and progress anyone&#39;s age if they want.  There is a limit though as if someone ages beyond hundred, they would die and turn into dust in an ern or regress all the way to their birth mother and then unconceive, as demonstrated by your daughter as she regressed too soon giving her previous age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Amanda looked to the spot where what was a puddle containing Candy&#39;s sperm dried up and was curious about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means that if my daughter regressed into nothingness, she won&#39;t return?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
The room was silent until it spoke up saying, &quot;Yes...  I&#39;m afraid so...  I am sorry for the loss of your daughter.  I know deep down you are sadden by this tragic event.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looked to the spot and was giving it some thought.  Giving a sigh, she said, &quot;Well, yes, apart of me feel sorry for my daughter&#39;s fate.  But that part was slowly fading away as the other part feels more happy that I&#39;m back to being a college party girl.  I really miss her, but I also miss this body and now I have a future that was once laid before me before Candy came to my life.  Now I have life I once have and goals and ambitions to achieve them now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room heard that and knew what it means, the regressing mentality is catching up with Amanda&#39;s age.  And even if she remembered glimmers of her daughter, it would be a matter of time before she would forget entirely.  But since it was all over, it decided to let Amanda decide on what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that your daughter regressed to nonexistence, I will give you the option.  You can leave this room and start your life anew, or you can stay and either regress or progress your body into whatever you want.  Just remember, don&#39;t age past a hundred or regress before your existence, this room isn&#39;t responsible for your fate like that of Candy.  So, what&#39;s it going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard the room and gave it some thought.  She should leave the Age Room and get the life she once had before her daughter came into her life.  Or, she can stay here and experiment with her age further, even if it means regressing or progressing to pre or post life.  What will she do?</p>
