<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch&#39;s wand began glowing again, and you felt something suddenly covering your groin. At first, you were quite relieved to have something, anything, covering your crotch. <br />
&quot;There! The nakedness problem is solved,&quot; laughed the witch heartily. &quot;Well, the lower body part, at least.&quot;<br />
You looked down. Unfortunately, your relief melted away like snow under the sun in a puddle of further shame. You were wearing a diaper! A big, fat, bulging diaper! Decorated with little teddy bears sporting baby pink bows, even! <br />
&quot;A diaper? Remove it!&quot; you exclaimed, overcome with shame.<br />
&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t want to be naked,&quot; said the witch with a false lack of understanding.<br />
&quot;Not like that! And you know it! This is barely better! And my chest is still uncovered! Stop pretending you don&#39;t understand!&quot; you say, clutching your chest to hide your boobs. <br />
Worse, you couldn&#39;t even remove the hated diaper because you really had nothing else to wear.<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about your chest, baby,&quot; said the witch in a syrupy-sweet tone of voice. &quot;Soon you won&#39;t have anything to cover in the first place.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean...?&quot;<br />
She waved her wand yet again as a form of answer and the transformations affected you at one. You saw the world get bigger around you but by now you had enough unfortunate experience with witchcraft and transformations that more likely than not, you were the one shrinking, and not the world expanding in size. Moreover, you sensed your bodies getting pressed, as if it was assaulted by dull muscle pains. You also felt your hair get shorter, receding from your back. Then, your legs got inexplicably weaker and you fell on your butt. You were secretly glad of the diaper for that. It broke the fall completely. But when the changes finally halted, you couldn&#39;t recognize your body. It was chubby! You had a belly, you were covered in baby fat and your fingers were like tiny fat sausages. The witch was giggling and you looked at her. Or rather looked up at her because she was towering over you. And try as you might, you could not get up or do better than move you arms in jerky movements. You attempt to push yourself upon your shaky legs but even if you&#39;re off to a good start, you have to give up and plonk back down upon your fanny again. Such an action was too tiring. Then, seized by a worry, you look into your diaper. Your privates are still a privacy! You&#39;re still a girl! You just have a bald crotch and a slit that you are happy to have the diaper cover, as awfully girly and juvenile as it is. You yell at the witch again but it only comes out as simple mispronounced words and baby talk. All that is left for you is to glare at the witch who is clearly having a blast.<br />
&quot;How can a pouty baby be so cute?&quot; she teased you. <br />
You shout out insults that only come out as baby babble.<br />
&quot;Why are you so fussy, you adorable princess you?&quot; she said in a false tone of pondering and putting her index to her cheek.<br />
After a few seconds, a face brightened in a theatrical way.<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; she exclaimed as she clapped her hands. &quot;It is because you&#39;re not dressed as the cute princess that you are! Don&#39;t worry, your fairy godmother will remedy to this.&quot;<br />
With a wink and a sing-song voice, she uttered soothing verses while shooting blasts of magic at you from her wand.<br />
&quot;A pretty pink bow for those honey-colored curls. A fancy dress to impress all at the ball. Pretty shoes worthy of Cinderella&#39;s. Ah! And a prince to kiss for the princess!&quot;<br />
After that wave of spells, the witch made a large mirror appear so you could look at yourself. You weren’t naked anymore, that was for sure... Instead, you saw in the reflection a one-year-old toddler decked in a medieval-inspired dress, a velvet bow in her shiny locks of hair, shiny shoes like pearls, and a frog plushie with a crown on its head. You were a baby! A very very girly baby! Dressed as a princess and ready to have a day out to do girly activities like having a tea party with your dolls and teddies or indulge in movies with princesses or queens. At least before you were an adult! You were naked but slipping on clothes would have been easy! This... This was worse! You were looking absolutely ridiculous! And dependant on adults! To get your diaper changed, even! You were utterly mortified!<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not stunning anymore,&quot; said the witch sweetly. &quot;Sorry. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll grow up to be just like the pretty lady you were before. You&#39;ll just have to wait a few year and eat lots of soup! In the meantime, you are so pretty that you shall be considered cute by anyone! I&#39;m sure your new parents will find you utterly enchanting!&quot;<br />
What? What did she mean &#39;new parents&#39;? And... She had no intention of changing you back to a boy? You wanted to shout out your frustration and anger in words but since it was impossible, you started to cry. The witch looked distraught or rather, pretended to be so.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re upset, little princess? Don&#39;t be. Your new parents want a very cute, very pretty, very silly and very girly little daughter. But it&#39;s not what you are exactly, right? You&#39;re just too upset by your pesky boy thoughts. But no matter. I have the solution!&quot;<br />
She made the mirror disappear and a pendulum appeared in her hand. She started swaying it in front of your face. Back and forth, back and forth. You knew she was hypnotizing you but as hard as you might try, you found it impossible to tear your gaze away from the swinging pendulum. Its movements made you relax at once and the witch&#39;s voice was just as comforting and soothing. It was so caressing, so full of good intent that you could not help trusting it. After all, she could do magic and she was your fairy godmother. What could she do wrong? Anything she did was for your own good so listening to her and believing her was very important.<br />
&quot;Your name is Fay. Fay. What a pretty name! Because you are beautiful as a fairy. Don&#39;t you agree?&quot;<br />
You nodded. She was right. You had seen your reflection, after all. You agreed fully with her.     <br />
&quot;You are Fay and you are as cute and dainty and delicate as a princess. Fay the fairy princess! Isn&#39;t that adorable?&quot;<br />
You nodded again. <br />
&quot;You are a baby. A toddler. But you know what you like already. You love everything that is pink and princess-y and girly. You adore fairy tales and you love them so much that it makes a little silly at times! But it&#39;s all right because being a princess and liking princess thing is so, so fun! It makes your heart bursts with joy! You love teddies and dolls and plushies. You love tea parties. You love pink and pastel colors. You&#39;ll grow up to be a true princess lady and fairy damsel. You are eager to please and be femininely endearing. You shall enchant all by your timid, sweet character. Isn&#39;t that right?&quot;<br />
You giggled, clapping your hands. Yes! Yes, it did sound right! Castles and princesses and dragons and knights and balls with pretty dresses looked fun! They made you happy!<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the nice lady said to you. &quot;Your frog prince is still a frog. Maybe you should kiss him to change him into a prince.&quot;<br />
The idea sounded really, really good and you hugged and kissed your frog prince toy with the strength you could muster. But he stayed a frog. No matter, he was soft to the touch and fun to squeeze and hug as he was. But there was still something bothering you. Something that escaped your lips instinctively.<br />
&quot;Mama...&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweetie,&quot; the nice lady said, picking you up. &quot;We&#39;re off to see Mama right now.&quot;<br />
You fell asleep on the way. The witch brought you to the same-sex male couple that had asked for a new child to the witch, a little sister for their older adopted son. The witch passed herself as an agent from an adoption agency and gave them papers to sign. Magically made by herself, of course. The two fathers were elated when seeing their new daughter. Well, one in particular. The one that had strong mothering instincts and loved to pamper his son already. They thanked the witch profusely. They didn&#39;t know how she did it but she managed to get exactly the sort of child they looked for each time! When she went on her way, the witch smiled to herself. These men deserved the children they wanted. They were kind and good people. And you had provoked her and humiliated her, even if unwittingly. So technically, you got off easy. She could have done a lot worse to you.</p>
