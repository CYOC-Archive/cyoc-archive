<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Marg no, don’t let the Spirit maneuver you to request of anything…, oh but I hurt!” Bob moaned as he felt his crotch burning, his balls regressing as up and moving inside his groin. He screamed when the searing pain caused his male penis to whither, as it wriggled quite painfully, doing as did his scrotum, regressing, becoming smaller.<br />
<br />
As Margery lay in a stunned and semi-conscious state, she lying flatly on the barn floor, Bob knew that he was touched by the curse. Pain wracked Bob in a hundred places all at the same time, but his mind remained alert, he fearing his fate!<br />
<br />
“Why, you baited my wife,” Bob moaning said, as he thinking, knew he had put over his shoulders the smaller blanket, the one made to best suit a pony size equine. As he lay there, Bob saw his arms were showing great changing, his fingers gnarling to form a fist as they turned a dark tan color.  He knew the curse was working and he was changing, becoming in due time as a twin to the pony mare Tilda.<br />
<br />
Bob knew he should be thinking as feeling a sense of horror from how the curse would leave him as changed; his gender and body, he becoming a she, but the becoming seemed as an elated thrill. Part of what was before then as Bob wanted him to yell stop; and something new as if original beckoned of him to accept the idea of living of life as would a pony mare.<br />
<br />
The searing pain in his groin began to fade, as Bob reached a changing hand and arm to touch, as feel at his changing groin. He could not reach his arm or hand that was changing, it becoming a fore-leg to feel at what he imagined would be as his new vulva and a nub being his/her new twat. Bob knew his pelvic region was going through a massive change, and the occasional snapping sounds from bone joints re-configuring suggested the reality of his future self.<br />
<br />
A struggle to move at all held Bob crumpled in a hunched forward pose, but he could turn his head, and when so doing, he saw then his dear wife lying flat on the barn floor. He squinting at his wife, blinking his eyes as if what he saw of her, she appeared to him as becoming a different woman.<br />
<br />
The flick of new pain then engulfed Bob’s head, as he felt his teeth wiggling in their sockets. His tongue seemed bigger, as did his lips were puffy, and his nostrils were larger.<br />
<br />
“I can’t stand all the pain,” Bob groaning said, as if pleading for his becoming unconscious and not knowing how his body was changing. As then he heard Margery moan, and she awakening, saw her hands, her arms, as her skin became the charcoal black hide of the pony mare named Tilda. As if that changed was not a horrific difference, Marg took note that on her arms were short slate gray hairs sprouting, the same body hair that Tilda had, was growing to covering of Margery with a pony pelt.<br />
<br />
“Robert,” Marg exclaimed as she looked toward her husband and saw the same skin coloring on him and his legs and changing feet had grown a winter’s pelt of pony fur. She watched in silence, seeing how her husband was changing, and the differences were happening quite fast.<br />
<br />
“Maragg…,” Bob slurring the name said, as he turned his head to cast a larger gold colored eye gaze at his wife. Marg gasped when she saw that Bob’s head looked the same as did the head of Tilda.<br />
<br />
“Medallion Spirit hear me, your Master, as I think my physical transformation is almost complete, is my husband becoming fully a duplicate of the pony mare named Tilda; as if so, I would have a request that he need not be an ignorant animal!<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for Bob to realize, as know of who he was, of what he became, if he being then as a female pony. Also, if it possible, make of him as her, that she be as sterile, I do not want him to need feel the pains from giving birth to a foal. I wish for Bob to experience life as would a pony and a mare, if he desires to chose the latter; feeling then for wanting of the mating with a stallion.<br />
<br />
I wish to let Bob do and live as he might desire, and not have either the curse or the Medallion govern him/her in any manner.&quot; Margery said as she specified to her wished desires for her betrothed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my Mistress Master,&quot; the Medallion Spirit said, as Margery was certain she heard the Spirit as if laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something more I should know, as you were laughing,” Marg asked of the Medallion Spirit.<br />
<br />
“Your son requested and caused the curse to stretch from its original purpose, but of your husband, he is accepting quite well the changes happening, making him as then a female, an equine, and retaining much of his mental prowess. She shall remember you and understand that you have changed as well.<br />
<br />
As so wished, Robert is now Roberta, a Welsh Mountain breed pony and a mare. Due to your request of her being sterile, the curse enhanced her sexual desire to equal that of a nymphomaniac human female, as Roberta will feel her estrus on a continuous, daily basis. She shall feel as humans slang term for her desiring ways is as being constantly horny!<br />
<br />
The curse was succinct about how Roberta would feel, and from past and similar occurrences, the purchase of a pony stallion would work well at quelling the rank sense for sexual passions your new pony mare shall be feeling as her constant need.” The Spirit so suggesting, and Marg then saw Bob, or Roberta to stretch, allowing of Marg to see a mare anus and below it a winking, black vulva.<br />
<br />
Roberta while stretching her different muscular form, then forced the horse blanket to fall off from her withers.<br />
As Roberta became more awake and alert, she opened her mouth wide to yawn and showed her new equine teeth, and a long tongue.  A full body shiver rattled along her lengthened spine, as made her to shaking her new tail, and felt the first of her vulva as it began a lifetime of winking.<br />
<br />
As with a shrill sounding whinny did Roberta scramble her four legs to gain a standing position!<br />
<br />
She shook her head, neck, and barrel torso, to wiggling her pelvis and caused her hairy tail to flick side to side several times. Robert knew how his body had become a female, and taking her first steps being a pony and then noticing her feelings of being a mare, she raised her tail and let go a loud fart. As she walked about inside the barn, she began to prance, seemingly elated by the feelings of her changed self.<br />
<br />
“Well, I see your new self is to your liking, you liked me for being female, and if what the Spirit said about you, you shall feel the pangs of want of having a mating on a daily basis.” Marg said, as after she had complimented her husband for becoming a mare and pony animal, she thought of the minister as coming soon, he expecting to talk with Robert and her about what became of their son Jared. However, Marg too had changed, and she seeing her blackened pony hide and the pelt, was reminded of a pony winter coat of fur had sprouted. Her appearance was such that she thought her future as serving, she belonged better to reside as part of a sexy sideshow with a traveling carnival.<br />
Roberta whinnied loudly, and prancing she trotted out the rear door of the barn and went toward the corral holding Tilda and Mildred.<br />
As Marg watched from the barn, she noted her new pony mare began sniffing the breeze, and that scent led her to take notice of the stallion Jasper; he nearly hanging over the four rail high pasture fence, as if wishing to give a sniff or more to the new mare.</p>
