<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No, Bill doesn&#39;t look like that, he isn&#39;t a woman!&quot; Tammy&#39;s clearly projected voice said, jabbing a flickering finger down towards Bill&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Bill followed Tammy&#39;s finger downward until finally his own non insubstantial breasts swelled into view. And suddenly, Bill was aware that the rest of his body was indeed changed. The former teenage boy turned woman brought the same hand he had touched Gloria with up to his eyes, seeing how slender and feminine it was, the shimmering of his longer nails from the lights floating above. that same hand felt his face, the changed shape of it, his puffier lips, perfectly smooth complexion, tugging on smooth, highly styled hair that was tied into some sort of pattern on top of his changed head. Bill&#39;s hands traveled down his apple-less throat, caressing the soft flesh of his new assets before venturing further down, traveling across the slightly sexualized business dress he now wore, feeling his hips and rear swelling out against the fabric of the skirt like they never had before, before sliding across perfectly smooth legs. It took Bill a moment to process where his feet were before he realized his new breasts were hiding them, and he twisted slightly to the side and felt his balance shift as he saw he was in a pair of black business heels. His arms were the last thing Bill inspected, they were bare up to the shoulder, clearly meaning to further advertise his new breasts, but he paused when he saw the marking on the underside of his left wrist.<br />
<br />
There, in tiny print that he realized that he would have never been able to read before, was stamped:<br />
<br />
AhnCorp Biofake Model SB-11098<br />
<br />
Beneath it was a string of numbers that meant nothing to Bill, followed by what was clearly a barcode.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, bitch, where is my Bill! Who are you, and why can&#39;t I feel my body!?&quot; Tammy hissed, clearly impatient, her holographic form tapping it&#39;s foot against the marble floor in silence, &quot;You better not have done anything with him or I&#39;ll...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Tammy, it really is me, Bill! I used the Stone, I just wanted Gloria to shut up!&quot; Bill flashed the lifeless gemstone in front of Tammy&#39;s face before pointing his own slender finger at the frozen artificial form of Gloria, &quot;But something has gone really, really wrong!&quot; His voice was so...light and airy as Bill truly heard it. There was a very proper cadence to it, with a hint of a accent. British? Irish? Scottish? Whatever it was, like the rest of his body it was a far, far cry from anything Bill had experienced before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; Tammy whispered, her avatar taking a few steps back as she took in the stone and Gloria&#39;s robotic form, &quot;But...what happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think you&#39;re a hologram?&quot; Bill stammered, shrugging his newly female shoulders and for the first time, feeling the ripple of movement across his additional flesh. Why hadn&#39;t he felt all this before? Was something wrong with him? Did...the stone do something else to him besides making him a woman?<br />
<br />
Tammy&#39;s face looked horrified as she examined herself, &quot;This...This can&#39;t be happening. This cannot be happening! I don&#39;t want to be a thing! I&#39;m a person!&quot; She cried out as simulated tears began to stream down her equally simulated face, &quot;Bill, you have to change us back! I want to be human again! I want to just be Tammy Ackerton!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill stared at the stone in his hand and noticed, for the first time, the large crack that ran down one side. Peering even more closely at the stone he could see tiny flecks of gold, either actual gold or gold light, trickling out from the center of the gemstone. Whatever it was, he had a really bad feeling about it. But Tammy was right, he had to try. Bill clenched his pretty little fist and closed his eyes, focusing on how messed up everything was, how it was all Gloria&#39;s fault, how he didn&#39;t deserve this...But no anger came. He knew he should be angry but he simply could not force himself to be. He opened his eyes and stared at the stone, and then at the troubling markings on his wrist.<br />
<br />
Was it because the stone was damaged...or was it because of something else? Something related to the markings? Bill shuddered and looked away, back at Tammy who was wringing her holographic limbs in a clear state of near hysteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!?&quot; She pleaded, and simply sank to the floor in a mass of colorful light with a sad moan. &quot;Why won&#39;t anyone let me be happy like I was? I loved being a mother! I loved being loved! I just want-&quot;<br />
<br />
But Tammy&#39;s existential angst was cut short as the sound of a door sliding open near the desk and the sharp click clakc of heels suddenly forced her to be silent as her form flickered out of existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy?&quot; Bill whispered, fear clear and present in his soft female voice, but as the sounds of the heels clicking became louder, Bill found himself straightening up on impulse, pushing his feelings of fear and confusion deeper within as he quickly walked over the Gloria&#39;s form and depressed a small LED button that was hidden at the base of her neck, her eyes lighting up once more as she and Bill assumed a very servantly posture as the owner of the heels came around the side of one of the columns. When he saw who it was, the inside of Bill&#39;s mind light up in alarm, but he could not force the rest of his body to react. He, outside of his normal breathing, seemed to be standing as perfectly still as Gloria.<br />
<br />
There, making her way to the massive desk, was Willow, Bill&#39;s future child turned older sister turned...something that filled Bill with dread. Willow was dressed in a very expensive looking business suit, though clearly not designed to overly sexualize her. She seemed slightly older, maybe in her late twenties, possibly thirty as she rounded the side of the desk, which came alive as holograms flickered out from the lights beneath the raised edge of the desk, and a chair unfolded from somewhere on the far side of the desk, Willow immediately sitting in it and leaning back, a long sigh of annoyance escaping from her lips as she rubbed the bridge of her nose slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bliss&quot; Willow said, her voice sounding harder, colder, more commanding than Bill had ever heard it before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mistress?&quot; Bill said, stepping forward as, to his horror, his body seemed to respond all on it&#39;s own. Could he be...No, it couldn&#39;t be possible...<br />
<br />
&quot;Bliss, I need you to head down to Records and pull all the dataspheres relating to our artificial intelligence development. Take that Gloria unit with you, since apparently this concerns them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mistress. Can I help you with anything else at this time?&quot; Bill felt himself say, while noticing the slightest twitch from Gloria&#39;s fingers at the mention of &#39;them&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but when you get back, I&#39;ll need you to take some notes while I go over the Ingerman-Bolstrum incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, mistress&quot; Came Bill&#39;s pleasant response, even though every part of his mind wanted to scream or just do something to prove his body, however changed, still belonged to him. But all he could do was perform a slight curtsy and tap Gloria on her shoulder, who immediately turned and followed Bill as he, under a power not his own, walked the length of Willow&#39;s massive office and through the equally massive doors at the far end. The whole length of the room he could feel...something looking at him, almost in desperation, but he, and Gloria, if she was truly in that shell, was obey. And all the while the overriding command seemed to float at the front of his consciousness:<br />
<br />
Travel to Records with GL-OR1A #698 unit. Go to Records and retrieve all the dataspheres on AhnCorp&#39;s artificial intelligence development. Upon return, take notes for Mistress Willow regarding the Ingerman-Bolstrum Incident and comply with any other orders.<br />
<br />
As the door closed, Bill could, with apparently far superior hearing than he had ever had before, heard Willow call out for Tammy.<br />
<br />
Option 1: Bill and Gloria somehow break free of their orders and realize the only way out of this reality is to fix the Anh&#39;Ger Stone. They hatch a plan to escape into the building, but despite Gloria&#39;s protests, Bill refuses to leave without first rescuing Tammy from Willow.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Bill and Gloria learn as much about this new reality as they can as they traverse the unfamiliar building with frightening ease, currently unable to break free of their orders. Bill and Gloria are only able to communicate with each other as Bliss and GL-0R1A #698, much to their frustration as they try to figure out a plan.<br />
<br />
Option 3: Bill, Tammy and Gloria are built to obey humans. Bill eventually succumbs to being Bliss, Willow&#39;s personal Biofake assistant, while Gloria vanishes among the rest of the robodroids, nothing more than expendable property, and Tammy is eventually uninstalled and deleted as a newer program is created to replace her. The Ahn&#39;Ger Stone eventually vanishes just as mysteriously as it appeared in a world that no longer exists.</p>
