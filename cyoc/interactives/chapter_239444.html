<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While he was in the kid&#39;s room, Randy had  decided to take the Chronivac with him, last time the program was no longer there when they investigate, and it would be foolish to leave it in the hand of an exhibitionist teenager.<br />
It will run the new setting Randy put in and then delete itself, as it was now on Randy&#39;s phone and it took the USB cord too.<br />
<br />
Randy arrived, he sees his partner holding a buff teenager in a fake naked outfit, probably this &#39;Jeff&#39;.<br />
As a parting gift, Randy has turn him into a big jock type but leaving him with his nerd personality and intellect, and make it as if he was wearing a fake naked skinsuit as a prank.<br />
<br />
As his partner was bringing the kid back to his home, Randy was feeling weird, not in a bad way, just different, and a grin appear on his face, his changes were starting.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s never been tall, muscular or very remarkable. <br />
Sure he try to and he was in a relatively good shape, but he was always envious of his buff tall and virile colleges, but now it would be is turn to be the best among them.<br />
<br />
He felt his uniform getting tighter against him, and as his look at his hands, he see them growing larger, bigger as small dust of hairs grows on them too. <br />
He felt ecstatic, and hide in a back alley he knew nobody ever pass by.<br />
<br />
It felt surreal, he could feel his bones and muscles moving inside of him, but in a nice and pleasurable way. <br />
He untight and undress, wanting to enjoy his changes.<br />
<br />
He was already getting taller, his merely 5&#39;6, he was often look down by others, but he was growing, inch by inch. He couldn&#39;t tell how much but he was probably closer to 6 feet and it wouldn&#39;t stop here. his legs and arms were so much longer, his previous shirt was feeling like a kid&#39;s cloth and his feet were growing too, large and big.<br />
<br />
His muscles weren&#39;t left apart too, his lean build was blooming, his arms were growing, his legs becoming tree trunks, his neck larger and larger and his torso. His chest was becoming a huge set of massive pecs and his belly was refining into perfect sets of abs.<br />
Randy was rubbing his new body, feeling his now strong and firm muscles growing on him, his whole body was steaming as he was hot.<br />
<br />
He felt his previously hairless body grow a nice pelt of hair, not too much, but abundant enough for him, his shave head growing a thick and complete beard, his chin getting squared and his appearance getting more masculine overall.<br />
<br />
As he finally reach the size he set in the Chronivac of 6&#39;5&quot; he felt a deep pleasure down, feeling his last physical change occurring.<br />
He wasn&#39;t even average down there, but it was about to change.<br />
<br />
He immediately got aroused, his length up but each time he tough he was hard, he felt flaccid and hardening again, growing like this from a 3 inch to a beastly 7 inches and very thick. His hand around his shaft all along, feeling his meat growing longer and thicker.<br />
He was moaning, and his balls weren&#39;t left alone too, from small to huge, hanging between his massive legs.<br />
<br />
He grunt as his jerk himself off, releasing multiple time, his cum at first dark getting clearer and whiter at each climax, like if he was putting the waste out of his system.<br />
<br />
It took him a good hour to change, and he was panting and very satisfy, he flex his new muscular arms feeling pride. His cloths on the ground were slowly extending, he had set up some reality change so for the world he would have become like this during the last years.<br />
He started to get new memories, that he knew were created by the Chronivac, of him getting praised and envied by others for his sudden change and growth spur, doctor not finding explanations but judging him still able to work, and getting many propositions for both sex.<br />
<br />
As he was slowly getting his cloths back, he saw someone looking at him from behind a trash container, he fake not noticing them and open his phone, and particularly the Chronivac, it was here now, all his to use and he had a new target for it...</p>
