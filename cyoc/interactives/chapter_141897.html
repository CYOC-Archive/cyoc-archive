<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lara looked out along the mall landscape and spotted a jewelry store, one of those high end ones that only sold a select set of brand name pieces and flaunted how they were of the highest quality diamonds, silver, and gold. She took my hand and headed over to it, my heart sinking as I realized that I would not be able to afford a single thing in there... well unless I gave up my car. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Lara whispered, walking up to a glass display case filled with various bracelets, a necklace cabinet sitting above it. &quot;They&#39;re so beautiful. Don&#39;t you just love how the diamonds refract the light?&quot; I had to admit I was impressed. She was no idiot. Most girls would use the term &#39;reflect.&#39; It wasn&#39;t really wrong per se but it also wasn&#39;t accurate. My smile was short lived as I beheld the four figure price tags and shuddered. Even the most plain looking silver bracelet cost nearly five hundred dollars. I know I&#39;m a bad hus- boyfriend but honestly that was a lot of money to drop on a body decoration. That&#39;s essentially what it is if we&#39;re honest about it. Fortunately she didn&#39;t dwell too much on them before turning around and moving to another glass cabinet to admire its contents. I glanced around the shop while she sat starry eyed at the display cases. There was no one around save for one woman manning the counter. She was fair skinned, had long dark hair kept in a neat pony tail, and wore ruby red lipstick and eye liner. Her outfit was a black waistcoat, pleated shirt, and creased dress pants making her look as much like a vegas card dealer as a jeweler. She was obviously bored, paying us no attention but instead leaning over the display case in front of her leasurly flipping through a magazine of some kind. At first I wanted to say something about her total lack of professionalism, but then I remembered that I really didn&#39;t have the kind of money to just drop on anything in here, so she probably saw no point in attending to a customer who won&#39;t buy anything. <br />
<br />
Lara moved along the room viewing watches, bracelets, necklaces, mantles, earrings, and chokers, finally coming to rest upon the rings which made up the customer service counter. &quot;Oh... that one&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Lara hissed looking at a ring. It was beautiful, made of two silver bands that interwove with each other, one solid while the other was inlaid with diamonds all the way around. At its top where the two strands became one, was mounted a square cut ruby. It took her breath away as she looked past the glass and admired the piece in the crystal light. &quot;That&#39;s the kind of ring I want when we get married,&quot; she smiled, looking over her shoulder at me. I couldn&#39;t help myself. She looked so cute the way her eyes seemed to sparkle when she mentioned us marrying. Memories of the morning we first met came flooding back. I almost wanted to see her in a wedding dress, with her hair done up in a veil, and a prize ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like a closer look?&quot; I asked, though I knew in my heart that I could never afford it. She flashed a look at me that I can hardly describe, almost like she never expected me to offer her something so nice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; she stammered in disbelief. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... why not? If you really want to get married...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes,&quot; she squeeled excitedly. I called to the girl at the desk who seemed annoyed by our presence and walked over to unlock the cabinet. She pulled out the ring and handed it to Lara who quickly put it on and looked at it as a prospector looks at gold. I have to admit, it suited her. <br />
<br />
I sighed, she was too excited about this, and while I had a feeling it would be way overpriced, seeing her giddy just broke a bit of my hardened will. &quot;How much?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;More than you can afford, kid,&quot; the desk clerk replied. Lara did not seem amused, losing all manner of excitement and wonder to glare. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I asked,&quot; I pressed, trying to assert dominance. I looked at her name tag and could barely hold in a guffaw as I read her name. &quot;I asked you, Veronica, how much is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look kid,&quot; Veronica began, leaning against the display case and eyeing me smugly. &quot;I get people like you in here all the time. Poor or broke, with hardly any income, and a girl on your arm who just doesn&#39;t get that you can&#39;t afford anything in here. Between the brand name and the fact that she&#39;s holding 24 karat silver inlaid with a dozen 8 karat diamonds, and a 16 karat ruby, I&#39;d say you&#39;re at least looking at twenty grand on her finger. The motto in this store is that if you have to ask for the price, you can&#39;t afford it. You&#39;re just trying to impress your girl here and it&#39;s not worth my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your time? You&#39;re just reading a magazine,&quot; Lara protested. &quot;So maybe he can&#39;t afford it, maybe we aren&#39;t a couple of millionaires but we&#39;re here and we&#39;re interested and it&#39;s your job to entertain our interest. What crawled up your ass and died?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t like my time waisted okay? I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s the best you can do but it&#39;s not my problem. Now are you done looking at the ring?&quot; Without a word, Lara slipped the ring from her finger and threw it towards the back of the store. Veronica&#39;s jaw dropped as she realized she would likely be spending the next couple of hours looking for something so small in such a sizeable store. &quot;You bitch,&quot; Veronica scowled, Lara simply cocking a smug eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I&#39;m so sorry it just slipped off,&quot; she grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize I&#39;m liable for anything that gets lost in here right?&quot; the other huffed. &quot;I can&#39;t afford to pay for that thing. What do I look like the golden goose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny you should say that,&quot; Lara smirked. I knew what was coming. Lara was going to mess with Veronica a little bit. At first I thought about stopping her but... Veronica was being a bitch and it didn&#39;t take her nearly as long to find the thrown ring as we had initially presumed. Satisfied with the results of her scavenger hunt, she returned to the counter, placing the ring back in its display box and then the case. <br />
<br />
&quot;You two are lucky I found it so quickly. Now please leave before I call security.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Veronica, are you feeling alright?&quot; Lara asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a bit annoyed, why?&quot; Veronica huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it just looks like you&#39;re cramping really bad,&quot; Lara said, raising an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m fi-&quot; her eyes bulged as she touched her abdomen tenderly. <br />
<br />
&quot;In fact, it&#39;s almost as though you&#39;re having a really heavy period,&quot; Lara continued. &quot;So heavy, that the cramps are making you nauseous.&quot; As Lara spoke, everything she said seemed to be coming to pass in real time. Veronica was bent over touching her abdomen and reaching up to cover her mouth. &quot;Actually, you&#39;re about to throw up.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner had the words escaped Lara&#39;s mouth than Veronica hurled, throwing up a stream of diamonds and gems that covered the counter and floor. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what the fu-&quot; she hurled again, another mass of diamonds and precious stones exiting her mouth. &quot;Wh- what the hell did you do to me you bitch?&quot; Veronica cried, tears streaming from her eyes as she leaned weakly against the counter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Why I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit. I&#39;m going to call security right now,&quot; she squeaked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You do that, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be curious to know how so many diamonds made it into your stomach. I can only imagine they&#39;d conclude a plot by you to smuggle out hundreds of gems went awry and your stomach couldn&#39;t take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what...?&quot; she hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes. I mean it&#39;s all on camera. We did nothing to you. You just starting throwing these perfect little trinkets up while we stood here and watched. I wonder how many are in there?&quot; We all heard an unhappy gurgle from Veronica. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, those are probably the pearls. They&#39;ve finally made it through your intestines and to your rectum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The wha-!&quot; Veronica was once again cut off, straightening up as though to hold something inside. It was no use, as a fart escaped her ass followed by another unhappy gurgle and then her pants began to tighten. Veronica moaned and turned beat red, feeling the round orbs of the pearls passing out of her asshole. Her pants got too tight, forcing her to unfasten and drop them where she stood, doing her best to conceal herself from onlookers. Sure enough her panties were filled with pearls of all shapes, sizes, and colors and they kept dropping out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... not the anal beads I&#39;d use but... I guess they work.&quot; Lara mused. &quot;Oh, but I almost forgot. You mentioned something about being a golden goose. Of course, that&#39;s just silly. Everyone knows the golden goose laid golden eggs. But then again, it is that time of the month...&quot;<br />
<br />
Veronica gasped again, gripping the counter with renewed vigor as she felt herself spread from the inside. She seemed to be trying to hold something in but it wasn&#39;t cooperating. I stared in utter confusion and amazement as her pussy lips spread wide to allow a golden dome to reveal itself. &quot;I&#39;m laying an egg,&quot; Veronica stammered, crying from how much she was stretching. &quot;I&#39;m laying a golden fucking egg.&quot; Sure enough the egg reached its apex and plopped out of her and onto the ground with a metallic thud before rolling a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow, you really are a golden goose now,&quot; Lara grinned, reaching over the counter to pick up the egg that was about the size of a baseball. &quot;Thank you for the gift. You can keep the rest,&quot; Lara smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;The...rest?&quot; Veronica huffed in confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course! All those diamonds and pearls, and every egg you lay from now till menopause. Don&#39;t spend it all in one place!&quot; Lara giggled, the look of horror on Veronica&#39;s face making her laugh. &quot;Oh, and if you ever need help getting those golden eggs out, call me,&quot; she concluded, dropping a piece of paper on the counter before leaving. It was surprising how no one paid attention to us with our golden egg, but then again they probably assumed it wasn&#39;t real gold.</p>
