<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brady always said he wanted a stripper.<br />
<br />
One wouldn&#39;t think he&#39;d feel so inclined. <br />
<br />
The college age young man divided up his attention between his business studies and his bodybuilding. Curly black hair crowned his head, women always said he had the prettiest blue eyes - well, when they weren&#39;t busy taking in everything else about his body. Standing six foot four inches tall and weighing 260 lbs, Brady was the kind of guy who very well filled out any tux or business attire that he ended up in. And indeed, his father wasn&#39;t shy about allowing Brady on to any cruise or excursion that was usually exclusive to business associates. Brady was wise enough to keep to his lane on such trips and leave his father to his own. In his own way, after all, the elder St. Cloud, Armand, was an older mirror of the younger.<br />
<br />
While the older St. Cloud had needed hair transplants to maintain his hairline and extensive creams and treatments to not look too wrinkled, Brady was in the prime of his life and obviously so. Both father and son often worked out together, sculpting a father / son workout routine along with their bodies. Brady&#39;s powerfully built body brought him a lot of attention from the girls at his exclusive college - and he was a kind enough roommate to give his &quot;brothers&quot; in the fraternity he naturally found himself a member in help in finding their own lay of the night.<br />
<br />
So we find him tonight - at the fraternity with two of his &quot;brothers&quot;, getting ready for another raucous night out on the town. The moon illuminated the streets that night, wide and full. Leaving the street lamps to simply provide a certain ambiance.<br />
<br />
The two brothers due to follow him into a night of debauchery would be Ethan McKnight and Charlie Carver.<br />
<br />
A former nerd, Ethan despite having gone through extensive steroid regimens in addition to gym workouts had ended up retaining his boyish good looks, the necessity of a pair of glasses covering his light green eyes, and dorky trusses of light brown hair. However upon seeing his body, nobody would be able to mistake the powerfully muscled Ethan for anything but a man&#39;s man. Tonight he wore a light green polo shirt, just large enough to conceal the slight roid gut he had going on, and a pair of well tailored jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we absolutely certain of the veracity of this occasion?&quot; Ethan asked, arms crossed as he looked at the clock and then at his friends. Though his body had changed, his speaking style hadn&#39;t exactly shifted much. &quot;I mean...I&#39;m just being sure. After all, Garrett&#39;s still missing - and nobody&#39;s heard from him in a while, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Charlie responded. &quot;I made sure to double and triple check the reservation at the club. We got strippers, drinks and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie by contrast with a lot of the other guys was heftier - though not less muscular. Enormous and brawny, Charlie despite his round face and double chin still had a handsome countenance, thick blond hair, and earthy brown eyes. Charlie dressed in a white tank top, black fitness pants, and a vest. Charlie was calmer than many of the other guys, and more down to Earth - though not averse to their usual shenanigans. He just usually saw himself as the one who&#39;d end up having to drive all the way home. When they drank or got high, it was always Charlie who got them home safe. And while that was quite a burden, Charlie saw the opportunity in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Brady put an arm around the shoulders of both Charlie and Ethan, &quot;Nobody&#39;s cancel on a party where they invited moi,&quot; grinning as he led the way out to the car, &quot;This is gonna be epic. Lots of hot ladies ready for the night of their lives. And if you two follow me along...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get our dicks wet, too.&quot; Ethan said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, what kind of brother would I be if I didn&#39;t help my bros get laid?&quot; <br />
<br />
Upon exiting the dorm, Brady opened up the doors to his car - he made sure that Charlie had his own set of keys both for the car and for the dorm largely due to how wild they could get. After all, it wouldn&#39;t do for him to get wrecked the night before a business class exam. Brady was a hard partying college jock - but that didn&#39;t mean he was reckless.<br />
<br />
Before long they were on the road, heading into the city from their sleepy little college town. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long before Brady and his bros could see the gradual replacement of the wide open fields and grassy hills with the skyscrapers and packed businesses lining streets - some pretty wild stores available and as they proceeded further, more night clubs and sex shops popped up along the road, along with strip clubs. While Charlie and Ethan hooted and hollered at the sight of some babes along the side of some random club, Brady kept driving - they had their destination picked out already.<br />
<br />
Though it was largely blocked out by the tallest of the towers, the moon still peaked through - foreshadowing some developments tonight that would reshape young lives. <br />
<br />
They eventually stopped outside a thrumming, three story establishment that had been reserved by Brady&#39;s fellow rich cohorts in school. <br />
<br />
It had previously been a warehouse, bought and repurposed by a local developer to provide a dedicated place for the wealthy college students to let loose. It catered pretty extensively to them - though the fee at the door was large, it wasn&#39;t too large as to cut too heavily into the allowances and trust funds of the attendees. The developer hired working girls and a couple working boys, tested extensively to avoid getting some rich guy&#39;s kid sick with the clap or something (though he couldn&#39;t have known about the more mystical infection...), and offered food, drink and catering at the club as well.<br />
<br />
In practice, it was an all purpose place for the elite college guys to come and unwind.<br />
<br />
As Brady parked in a nearby parking garage, he could already see some other people from the college had arrived as well. Kevin Holland greeted them as he stepped out of his vehicle, &quot;Greetings, Brady! You&#39;re looking as stunning as always.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the very well toned swimmer&#39;s hand in a strong handshake, Brady chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m just not the sloppy type. Always glad to hear that I&#39;m keeping to my own standards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin was more a really toned guy than a big guy, fitting for his sport. His golden blond hair styled short, bright blue eyes and well tanned body all made him quite popular in the club - though not with girls. Kevin was gay, and though a few other guys at the school looked askance at the association, Brady enjoyed having Kevin&#39;s opinion on a lot of things. The gay perspective was, as far as he was concerned, a valuable one.<br />
<br />
As the three now four started in toward the club, Charlie asked, &quot;You still all on about that dude Joaquin there?&quot; Joaquin being one of the male strippers and someone Kevin often invited over to his table for fun and drinks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, pretty much, big cub.&quot; Kevin beamed, eager to see Joaquin.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way...what&#39;s cub mean?&quot; Charlie asked - cognizant that Kevin had called him that a couple times before this outing, but now he was curious enough to want to know. He did however feel like it was a compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Like a gay bear, except not as hairy.&quot; Brady responded as the four walked on to the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of my types, I guess,&quot; Kevin stated, &quot;I mean, if you ever get tired of women all the time, Charlie, I could help you experiment a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I&#39;ll think about it.&quot; Charlie said quickly, the group joining the line in front of the business and fishing out their wallets. Easily the nicest in the group&#39;s being Brady&#39;s of course, though Kevin&#39;s was a close second - Kevin was up there with Brady in terms of wealthy dads. Though Kevin was a bit more tightly guarded in how he spent his trust fund money. <br />
<br />
As they mixed into the line - chatter starting to fill the air, Ethan whispered to Charlie, &quot;...You&#39;ll think about it? You going queer, man?&quot; A quick elbow to the side and a smile made it clear that while it was said jokingly, it wasn&#39;t a mean joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Charlie stated, &quot;I&#39;m just not ruling anything out. I mean, I&#39;ve had sex with women on a lot of excursions with you guys, but maybe---just maybe---I&#39;d like to test the waters. See how life&#39;s like on the other side of the---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna bottom to Kev?&quot; Ethan quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fat chance. If I go gay, I&#39;m topping.&quot; Charlie retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie, it&#39;s more than just size, it&#39;s experience.&quot; Brady laughed, and looked his friend in the eyes, &quot;Kevin&#39;s been gay his entire life. You&#39;d be giving it the old college try. He&#39;d be on top.&quot; <br />
<br />
A quick huff by Charlie made it clear the hefty young man wasn&#39;t budging on the issue.<br />
<br />
Before long though, the group was at the pay window. <br />
<br />
In front of them, Kevin looked at the boyish, well toned young man at the window register and handed him his card, &quot;Here, on my card. And if you want, we could have some fun later! After your shift!&quot; Kevin walked in and the young man at the register blushed a bit, though he didn&#39;t say yes or no.<br />
<br />
Brady walked to the register and handed over his card, &quot;All three of us on my card. After all, I&#39;m Brady St. Cloud.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take very long for the trio to split off and go do their own things on the floor - after all, the Prima Deva Club was extensive, sprawling, and had just about every pleasure that would entice even the strictest protestant son to go a little wayward. The lights shone throughout the club, bathing everything in a sort of retro 80s vibe that seemed only to exist in movies and nostalgia bait tv shows. The people on the central dance stage brought a lascivious grin to Brady&#39;s face - well formed stripper girls all gyrating on stage, shown in more detail when the lights darting about further up aligned on the center stage.<br />
<br />
There were a large number of seats around the central area, framing the place and leading toward a few sets of stairs that led toward three extensive dining areas, serviced by slightly more modestly dressed working girls. Apparently even the chef herself was someone uplifted by the owner - he&#39;d noticed one of the older girls had something with her, and upon seeing she was doing this on the side as she worked toward catering and restaurant jobs, he helped her get on her feet and ultimately end up the chef at the Prima Deva.<br />
<br />
Further up by a pair of long, winding staircases by the walls were the VIP areas, where the guys like Brady felt free to bring the girls or guys of their choice for a wild 30 to 60 minutes. <br />
<br />
As Brady took a seat, he looked at the stage, examining the women working tonight.<br />
<br />
He knew he was always a high priority one, but he liked to offer some extra incentive. As he looked at the women one after another, he unbuttoned his dress shirt, one button at a time. They stripped for him, so he&#39;d give them a bit of the same consideration. Letting them see his gym honed pectorals and abs as he saw their beautiful, sexy bodies. Beauty meets beauty, as far as he was concerned.<br />
<br />
But then as he sat there, waiting to see someone who really got his attention, Brady&#39;s eye was caught by someone who was introduced on to the stage as &quot;Sinnamon&quot;. True to her name, she was a tanned, beach ready beauty who just about swaggered on stage without the slightest hint of trepidation or shame. Clad in a form fitting bikini and thong, her long, dark brown hair and amber colored eyes let it be clear how she chose that name.<br />
<br />
And as soon as she saw the preening college jock readily showing off his body to her in kind, she made her choice - for more than one reason.<br />
<br />
Brady could feel his cock getting hard already. She was eyeing him, she knew what she was doing as she danced on stage, primarily showing her assets to the side of the area where he sat. The rich boy bit his lip to try and keep himself from getting too worked up. He didn&#39;t want to just bust a nut right into her pussy when she and he went right on up to the VIP section. It was just a matter of time...<br />
<br />
As she went on, it seemed she was testing his endurance more and more. Doing everything she could to try and get him more worked up. Brady&#39;s shirt was starting to get a little slick with sweat. His trimmed chest more delineated by the sheen of moisture. He rolled up his sleeves and adjusted his crotch. She knew what she was doing, she knew and he did the best he could to avoid ending up too excited to function. But being a young man at the end of the day, managing himself in such a way was difficult.<br />
<br />
The money he sent her way was pocket change to a man of his station. But it was probably going to be the best pay day she&#39;d had in some time.<br />
<br />
But then she got done with her routine on stage, and as she headed off, equally worked up as he was, he could tell she was going only one place. And indeed, here she came - walking right on over to him. &quot;You ready to go, rich boy?&quot; She looked him over, &quot;You&#39;re definitely well formed...&quot; A quick glance at Brady&#39;s crotch informed her of his size, &quot;In every aspect. But it&#39;s more than size. It&#39;s how you...use it.&quot; She then pressed up against him and let out a mewl of content when she felt how hard his muscles were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I am real good at using all this size. And I&#39;ve been itching all night to show you how.&quot; Brady led the way confidently toward one of the staircases leading to the VIP Section. For her part, &quot;Sinnamon&quot; followed along - though it seemed she was eager to do so for more than one reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s make this our night of fun, big man.&quot; Cupping his ass as she straddled up behind him, she moaned under her breath as she felt up his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who has the nicer ass, me or you?&quot; Brady joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hope it was me, but you&#39;ve got something else in these dress pants.&quot; Though she cut it mostly out while they walked up the stairs, it was clear as she pressed as close as she could that she was looking forward to this. As they got up to the VIP Floor, Brady looked around - the room was large but had no area for personal privacy. Thus when someone came up to have sex, they&#39;d have to make due with seeing anyone else in there having sex too.<br />
<br />
As Brady entered, removing his shirt first and then his pants, he saw that he was not alone in here tonight. <br />
<br />
Charlie had found a hot date on the floor of the club - and was now merrily fucking her, though he had to be careful due to his sheer weight. The tall and hefty young man flexed a bicep as he thrust away. Going by the sound the woman was making, it seemed like more than one thing about Charlie was plus size. <br />
<br />
On one of the other couches in the VIP area was Kevin and Joaquin, the Latino stripper eagerly taking Kevin&#39;s cock up his ass. As Brady and Sinnamon headed toward the couch just to the right of the gay duo, Brady extended a hand for a fist bump. Kevin for his part right in the middle of sex fist bumped Brady and then went back to what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Brady took his seat on the couch, thankful for the upkeep that kept these things clean, and stripped off his boxer briefs next. &quot;Now...let&#39;s see you---holy shit...!&quot; Sinnamon was even spicier and hotter somehow without the even slight bits of clothes she wore for her job. As she climbed on to the couch shortly after Brady, the stripper cupped his cheeks and then kissed him - hot and heavy. She decidedly kept her hand away from Brady&#39;s cock, knowing he was already pretty far along due to all her teasing.<br />
<br />
Once the kiss broke, Sinnamon looked him in the eye and got ready, &quot;Cowgirl time.&quot; As she slipped his cock inside of her and started bringing her hips up and down on top of him, Brady thrust as hard as he could but tried to keep his control ironclad. Not that it was easy - he didn&#39;t know what it was. He&#39;d fucked his share of slutty sorority girls and strippers already, but this woman was something else. It seemed like there was something about her that just drove him up the wall arousal wise.<br />
<br />
He could barely keep control of his dick with the way she was going on him. <br />
<br />
But he managed - even as he started to feel so good that he was just twitching all over. It was like the build up to an orgasm, all over and all at once, but it never came. Yet. <br />
<br />
Before long however, he was on top as he was wont to be.  Brady groaned as he thrust away, feeling her hands rake on his lats and powerful back as he enjoyed the best sex of what seemed like his life. He swore she got really into this, even biting his shoulder a bit - though not too hard - and just enough to register as play in the sack. Though it was actually more than that.<br />
<br />
This was going to be the best Saturday ever...! He had to get her number!<br />
<br />
But any thoughts beyond what was going on here and now were swept away as Brady grunted out between clenched teeth, &quot;I&#39;m---I&#39;m gonna cum---!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cum for me.&quot; She whispered in his ear, and that was the last thing he remembered as the orgasm he experienced obliterated his awareness and his capacity for rational thought. He vaguely thought he was having more sex, going on and on, but it was like a dream he experienced only from the outside looking in...<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
By the time Brady St. Cloud awoke at about 4:30 AM from whatever fugue he had ended up in, he was being shaken awake by Charlie Carver, who seemed worried. &quot;Dude, club&#39;s closing in 30 minutes. Dude! Dude come on, even Kevin got done an hour ago with Joaquin - Ethan&#39;s waiting in the fucking car...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did---Did he get---get laid as good as---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As we did? Sure as shit.&quot; Charlie helped Brady up, as the athlete realized that for some reason he felt wiped right now. More than he ever had before even after a long night of partying. Though it wasn&#39;t like he was perpetually that worn out. As Brady recouped from whatever state that was, he looked around for Sinnamon - but couldn&#39;t see her. It seemed she made her exit - and thankfully, she left his wallet and goods with him.<br />
<br />
As Brady got dressed and started hurrying out, still a little bleary, Charlie elaborated, &quot;Dude got laid with Clara Lambert from Gamma Gamma Phi. Turns out she loves the club life too - and loves nerd dick too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brady was happy by the time he got out to the car to just let Charlie drive them back to the dorm. He just about registered Ethan raising questions about what happened with him in there, but he was still pretty tired - and it was 4 AM after all. So he was out like a light again.<br />
<br />
By the time they got home, it was easier to rouse Brady again to get him to head back inside the dorm to crash on a bed instead of the inside of a car. Brady was just disappointed that he didn&#39;t get Sinnamon&#39;s number. By the time he crashed in bed at the dorm, he barely registered anything - or indeed, how he was feeling kind of weird. It was normal to feel a little off due to the time issue - but tonight it was like some residual effect of a sugary drink.<br />
<br />
A slight giggle and then Brady was yet again asleep.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
By the time Brady woke up the next morning, he was grateful it was a Sunday because it was 11:25 in the morning. &quot;Fuck...that got me good.&quot; He stretched and noted as he did that to his satisfaction he didn&#39;t seem to have to worry this morning about his body hair. Usually every week or some odd amount of time at about that interval, he would have to shave up his body hair. But it seemed like his body hair was either finer today or just not as present. And that meant his muscles looked great despite the long night he just put himself through.<br />
<br />
He remembered everything that happened last night. Meeting Kevin at the club, seeing the gorgeous and mysterious Sinnamon, who still resulted in him feeling a twinge of erotic interest... and then the intrusive thoughts. Kevin honestly looked phenomenal. Simply amazing that night. He could see why Joaquin so often went for the handsome swimmer. Kevin was low key actually kind of hot---woah. Woah. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Brady long to notice. He shook his head, and noted his hair seemed about half an inch or less longer than usual in some spots. &quot;Gonna need a haircut. I&#39;m not into the beach bum look.&quot; Little did Brady know, the next changing night would come on Tuesday night - and he would experience a slow build up of changes up until that night. Brady&#39;s changes though due to the sheer variance would not exactly be into the same subject as Sinnamon.<br />
<br />
He would be changing into...</p>
