<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39;<br />
James looks down at his body seeing his skin slowly turn pink; he looks in a glass window and sees white form around his mouth and eyes. Looking down he sees his pubic hair turn blue, running his hand through his hair he feels it curl around his finger forming a blue afro.<br />
&#39;I am really turning into a clown&#39; James thinks in disbelief<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t want to be a clown&#39;<br />
James slowly looks around and realizes he is standing naked in the middle of the street. Oddly enough naked clowns apparently don’t seem to be out of place here. People paused and laughed but figured it was a clown being silly. James looks back towards to the bar and sets off the other way. He eventually finds an alley next to a club and darts in. He stops and considers how he got into the mess. He was just going into the club for a one night fling; he had been exploring his gay side since he was young. He and his friends messed around when they were young giving themselves relief when they didn&#39;t have girlfriends that would put out and it continued all their lives. He and his friends still got together and sucked and fucked each other during &#39;poker night&#39; just for fun.<br />
&quot;HA, Ha, ha&quot; he laughed at the thought not being able to stop for a while. A door opened into the alley and a very hot woman sneaked out and lit up a cigarette. She had on a tight mini skirt, long beautiful brown hair and dramatic makeup. James stood there naked admiring her not worried about turning into a clown or being naked. She finally notices him and laughs.<br />
&quot;Ha, ha. Looks like you need some help.&quot; she motions him inside. Not really having any other options and having a hot girl help him was a dream come true. He followed her in to a back corridor.<br />
&quot;This is my dressing room.&quot;<br />
James walks in and sees clothes hung up everywhere, a vanity and wigs.<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; James said not really knowing where to start with everything that has happened tonight.<br />
&quot;No problem. Here you go, it is all I have.&quot; She hands him a pair on silk panties. James takes them and considers for a while but again not having a lot of options he steps in to them and pulls them up. The silk brushes up his legs sending shivers through him before it envelops his ass and cock. The feeling of the silk around his butt and cock was starting to give him a erection, he felt ashamed that it did. James quickly sat down to hide any erection he might get.<br />
&quot;Were you doing a clown joke streaking through the city? haha&quot; she asks<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a clown, I was in a bar and I......&quot; James trailed off<br />
&quot;You’re not a clown? You do look like you need some help with your make up.&quot; She pulls James in close and starts to draw on his eyebrows upward at a sharp angle.<br />
&quot;No, no. I don&#39;t need help. I&#39;m not a clown.&quot; James didn&#39;t pull away from her, he was getting a up close look at her breasts and her perfume was making him a little fuzzy.<br />
&quot;You look like a clown?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I was in a bar giving this clown a blow job......&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, so you’re a gay clown. You need some better lips than.&quot; she interrupts him spread some orange lipstick on his lips and outlining them in red before blending the two together creating a sexy look.<br />
James feels tingles on his lips as they fill out and turn upward into a cocksucker smile &quot;Mmmmm... Yes. I mean no, I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you’re a bi clown?&quot; she asks as she brushes blush onto his cheeks.<br />
&quot;No. I mean yes I&#39;m a clown. No, I&#39;m not. What I meant was I&#39;m not gay. I just enjoy sucking dick.&quot; James was getting totally fluster trying to explain his actions her perfume filled his senses. She placed a knee in his crotch pressing against his erect dick and moved in closer to him.<br />
&quot;Your dick tells me you enjoyed sucking his dick, are you sure you’re not gay?&quot; She takes a brush and begins to brush out the curls of his blue hair.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;m gay. I…….&quot; James said dreamily as his eyes fogged over and laughs. He feels his hair start to tickle his shoulder as it grows longer. She brushes it around his face and he sees that it is now a shade of purple. It is getting harder for him to breath as a weight start to develop on his chest.<br />
&quot;Oh, so you are a gay clown.&quot; She backs up and starts to play with the red balls that are now his nipples. James inhales sharply as he feels the shocks of pleasure go through his system from her ministrations.<br />
&quot;Yes, I am a gay clown.&quot; James repeats<br />
&quot;I forgot to introduce myself, I am Lily. I&#39;m a female impersonator and perform here.&quot; She applies some mascara to his eyelashes and they grow longer and glitter. She then highlights his eyes with some green eye shadow.<br />
&quot;I think you need something to help these before you go on stage and performing.&quot; She indicates his small A cup breasts. James looks down and wonders in a detached manner when he got those. She presents him with a padded bra and helps him put it on. The bra pushed up his small tits giving him bigger breasts and cleavage.<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; James comments as he stares at his new body.<br />
&quot;You can do me a favor?&quot; She pulls down her panties and lifts up her skirt and a dick springs forward. &quot;I hate to get a boner on stage could you give me some relief?&quot; James sees the dick spring forward into his face and feels a hunger build in him.  James licks his lips and moves forward to take the cock in his mouth. &quot;Boffo has wanted a performer for his club. I think you would do great.&quot; James takes the cock in his mouth and begins to suck hard on it feeling the hard warm shaft enter and leave his mouth. She was giving him a steady stream of precum that was running down his throat warming his stomach. Tingles were running over his body pulsating with the cock going in and out of his mouth. She grabs his head and begins to face fuck him hard and fast getting closer to cuming. James sucks harder as he feels the tingles increase over his body overwhelming him with feelings of bliss. He grows shorter, smaller and his features soften becoming more feminine. The head of his cock inflates to a red ball and starts to leak precum over the panties. James feels a pressure building in his nose as the tip turns pink. Lily finally slams forward hard orgasming in his mouth before pulling out till just the head is in his mouth letting him savor the taste of her cum. Jamie savored the taste of the cum as it shoot over his tongue. <br />
&#39;This is why I am here. To collect cum and entertain.&#39; James thought as he swallowed the cum enjoying the warm feeling in his stomach as the tingles raced over him.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good girl but you ruined your panties&quot; She criticized him as she pulled off his panties. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to take care of that.&quot; She slowly starts to stroke Jamie&#39;s dick. &quot;Cum for mama.&quot; Jamie goes over the edge as orgasm rack his body and with a pop his nose expands into a glittering pink ball. New knowledge of being a clown, performing and singing fill his mind as a fills Lily&#39;s hand with his cum. Jamie&#39;s dick shrinks down to less than an inch long no longer needed for anything important. Lily brings her handful of cum up to Jamie&#39;s colorful lips and tips it into his mouth. Jamie laps up his cum and rolls it around his mouth before swallowing wanting more. Lily helps him get dressed in new panties and a colorful mini skirt before helping him onto backstage at Boffo&#39;s.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
Jamie stood there waiting for the curtain to open excited to perform again. The crowd was always fun as he told jokes between songs but he especially looked forward to after the performance. All those dicks waiting to be satisfied, his ass grew in his skirt ready to accept them all as he licked his lips imagining all the cocks running between them too. This is why he was here, to entertain and satisfy as many cocks as he could.</p>
