<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Brenda changed Mark was oblivious to these changes and he like a <br />
scared little rabbit headed to the boat.<br />
<br />
When he hit the clearing he saw half a dozen boar men in front of him. <br />
None of them were looking in his direction so he backed up into the <br />
forest underbrush. As he crouched down he saw several others coming <br />
down the beach oinking like pigs with a word here and there of <br />
English.<br />
<br />
What the hell happened here he asked to himself.<br />
<br />
As he sat there he felt a stick poke him in the back. As he turned to <br />
move the branch from his shoulder he looked up and there was the <br />
biggest fattest boar man of them all.<br />
<br />
Get going boy.<br />
<br />
Mark tried to jump up and run but he was no match for the boar man.<br />
<br />
The boar man held him by his shoulder so Mark couldn't straighten up <br />
and get to running as he was forced into the clearing.<br />
<br />
The other boar men surrounded him and he realized that he wasn't going <br />
anywhere.<br />
<br />
The big boar man pierced Marks nose with a big ring and attached a <br />
chain to it so he could lead his new acquisition around properly.<br />
<br />
You are going to be my new toy.<br />
<br />
Mark was led back to the area where he saw Brenda as a half pig woman <br />
quickly changing into a full sow stuffing her face at the trough.<br />
<br />
The boar man chained his human into his own sty and told him to eat. <br />
Mark looked at the trough and his stomach churned. He was going to be <br />
sick.<br />
<br />
I SAID EAT!<br />
<br />
Mark picked up something that looked the least nasty and put it in his <br />
mouth. Mark took little bites and his eyes opened as he realized that <br />
he liked the taste. Soon Mark was stuffing his face with gusto. He <br />
felt himself growing. His stomach painfully full but he just couldn't <br />
help it.<br />
<br />
If Mark had been listening he would have heard the discussion about <br />
his future. The big boar man was asked by one of his generals, So when <br />
ya gonna turn him into a pig?<br />
<br />
I don't know. I might not turn him into a pig at all. I want to see <br />
what happens when he stuffs himself with the special formula in the <br />
food. So no one gets to fuck him till I say. You know what will happen <br />
to you if anyone does.<br />
<br />
They all shuddered.<br />
<br />
Within a week Mark had lost his muscled body and was close to 250 <br />
pounds with a big ball belly. He was laying in the mud his shirt <br />
buttons undone to relieve the pressure and his pants were unbuttoned. <br />
When he wasn't eating he would sit up against the pen his legs spread <br />
wide to allow his belly to sag between his legs. His shirt stained <br />
with food and his face growing a beard. He wasn't able to shave so he <br />
became more and more grubby and slobby as the days went on.<br />
<br />
The boar men would come and rub his belly and poke him as he grew <br />
softer and softer.<br />
<br />
Brenda was bread daily as Mark just ate and ate. She was growing but <br />
not as fast as Mark was. But then she had a litter of piglets growing <br />
inside of her.<br />
<br />
When mark had reached a bit over 800 pounds the big boar discussed <br />
Mark's new direction.<br />
<br />
Lets turn him into a sow now. He will be good for breeding.<br />
<br />
The big boar thought about that.<br />
<br />
Lets just feed him till he explodes.<br />
<br />
He is good as he is now lets just use him as a funny human.<br />
<br />
As the big boar heard the different options he thought to himself that <br />
maybe he would send Mark back to his own life. He would never be able <br />
to find the island again and if he did they could change him into a <br />
sow at that time.<br />
<br />
The big boar stuck Mark with a needle putting him to sleep as he was <br />
moved to his boat. When he awoke he no longer remembered the island. <br />
His mind had been stripped bare of his ordeal but there was no way he <br />
could explain his new form. Where was Brenda? He thought, not knowing <br />
she was on her second set of piglets.<br />
<br />
When he was rescued the tanker had to use a crane to hoist his big <br />
body out of the small personal boat. He found his appetite had been <br />
greatly enhanced by the months of stimulant added to his food  on the <br />
island so there was no way he was going to lose the weight. And as he <br />
motored into his old job on one of those electric carts there weren't <br />
many that recognized this tub of lard but if they looked close some <br />
would see the old Mark in the new supersized version.<br />
<br />
Mark would go out in his the boat he was found in from time to time to <br />
try to figure out what had happened to him and Brenda but he never <br />
found the island again. Mark had never had a boyfriend before but now <br />
that he was the supersize one there were all sorts of men after him. <br />
Some chasers, some bears, but all liked the new Mark. He was so much <br />
less arrogant and more cushion for the pushin.</p>
