<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max heard a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, are you okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Max immediately recognized the voice of his master, John.<br />
<br />
Or should I say soon to be former master, thought Max with a smile.  He looked at his body.  He was changing.  His fingers were thinner, and more slender.  His waist was more narrow, and his skin was softer.  He had lost a few inches in height, and his whole body seemed to be getting smaller as he lost muscle mass.  But he was changing too slowly.  He was still undeniably a man.<br />
<br />
Max cleared his throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go ..... go ..... go away,&quot; said Max shakily.  <br />
<br />
He had difficulty forming the words in his mouth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, are you okay?  Your voice sounds weird.  And what was with that weird voice message?  Is Max okay?&quot; asked John through the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go away, &quot; said Max more confidently.  His voice sounded different, a little higher.  To John it sounded like a young boy going through puberty.  &quot;It&#39;s not safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was now concerned.  &quot;Let me in, Mary.  I am not going away, at least not until I see Max.  Now open the door, &quot; said John firmly.<br />
<br />
Max panicked.  He couldn&#39;t let John see him like this.  What would he think?  But John was obviously not going to leave. He looked at the door and its strange lock.  He wasn&#39;t sure that he could open it even if he wanted to.  He was saved by a heavy thud. <br />
<br />
At first Max thought that John was trying to break down the door.  His hearing was not as good as it used to be. But a second thud allowed him to find the source of the sound.  It was coming from the bathroom.  Something large was banging against the door from the other side.  Mary must have used another vial, too.  Whatever she was now, he doubted that he would be able to dominate her, and establish his role as the new Alpha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, what was that?  Are you hurt?&quot; asked John. Max heard silence from John&#39;s side of the door.  <br />
<br />
Has he gone? Max wondered, leaning close to the door.<br />
<br />
He felt a powerful thud, as John slammed something into the door.  He was trying to break it down.<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s panic rose to a fever pitch.  He was being assaulted from two sides!  He fled into Mary&#39;s bedroom, grabbing the box of vials as he fled.  He looked around the room, and hid in Mary&#39;s closet, throwing the box onto her bed.  He slammed the thin door shut, cowering underneath her dresses.<br />
<br />
Max sat nude in the closet, huddling in fear.  He felt the cloth of the dresses around him.  Maybe he could protect his soft, vulnerable flesh with these garments.  He stood up and struggled to slip one on. It twisted and rolled as it moved down his changing body.  He was still too big, and the dress fit him poorly.  He pulled the dress off, turning it inside out.  He felt his body continue to change, growing smaller and slimmer.  He pulled the dress down again.  It fit better, but still looked ruffled.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the closet door popped open.  Max closed his eyes and cringed, assuming a submissive position, and hoping that Mary would accept his surrender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, are you okay?&quot; asked John, holding his hand out to Max.<br />
<br />
Max recognized his former master&#39;s voice, and opened his eyes.  John was standing above him, with his left hand outstretched.  In his right hand were the familiar tools of discipline he used to train Max - a shock clicker and a stick.  Max hesitated, then realized that John had called him Mary.  It had worked!  John now thought he was Mary!  <br />
<br />
He reached up and took John&#39;s outstretched hand.  John pulled him up off the ground.  Max saw with a shock that he was much shorter now, almost a head shorter than John when standing.  He was still transforming.  He adjusted his dress to cover his male genitalia.  It was much smaller, but still present.  He didn&#39;t want John to see through the illusion.<br />
<br />
But John had other things on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, what the hell is going on here? Did your old boyfriend attack you or something?  Where is Max?  Is he okay?&quot; asked John quickly.  <br />
<br />
A large thump from the bathroom shook the whole room.  They could hear the sound of wood splintering.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And what in God&#39;s name is making that noise?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
Max cleared his throat again. &quot;That is Max, &quot; he said clearly.  His voice now had a soft high effeminate tone.  He felt his throat, and noticed that his Adam apple had receded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max?&quot; said John with shock, as he walked into the living room.  &quot;What is wrong with him?  Why did you lock him in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Max ran after John, grabbing him by the arm.  In his haste, he left the bedroom door open.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t open that door!  Something happened to him!  He changed into a monster and attacked me!&quot; yelled Max.<br />
<br />
John looked dubious, but the door was suddenly ripped off its hinges. A massive hulking dog-like creature exited the room, and walked towards the living room.  Max almost wet himself at the sight of the angry monster.  He was sure that if he was still a dog his old instincts would have won out and he would not have been able to control himself.<br />
<br />
The creature stared at them. He appeared pleased to see John, wagging its tail at the sight of him.  But when it looked at Max its eyes went wide, and it stared at him with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that?&quot; said John, staring at Mary in shock. <br />
<br />
Max saw Mary trying to explain. He had to stop her, or she would ruin everything.  He quickly interrupted her stumbling words with some of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you .... that&#39;s Max!  He turned into a monster and attacked me!&quot;  said Max.<br />
<br />
The beast looked at Max in shock, then began to growl deeply.  This time he did wet himself a little.  His changing anatomy didn&#39;t allow him much control, and it dribbled down his thigh.<br />
<br />
John assumed a defensive position, and shielded Max.  He held up a stick in one hand and his Taser in another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad Max!  Bad boy!&quot; said John angrily.<br />
<br />
The beast looked hurt by his words, and  even whimpered a little as it lowered its ears<br />
<br />
&quot;No ... Max ....&quot; it struggled to say, in a deep gravely voice.<br />
<br />
John dropped his hands in shock, almost discharging the Taser on his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can talk, &quot; said John softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to it.  It&#39;s evil, &quot; said Max quickly.  He had to keep Mary from telling the truth.<br />
<br />
The beast turned on Max and snarled.  It glanced in the bedroom, and Max followed its gaze.  He saw the box of vials on the bed through the open bedroom door.  He looked at the face of the beast, and saw it&#39;s eyes narrow.<br />
<br />
So, she knows, thought Max.  It doesn&#39;t really matter.  She was going to figure it out eventually anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max.....&quot; grunted the beast angrily, as it lunged towards Max.  He was sure he was dead now, but John bravely stepped forward and tried to shock it.<br />
<br />
Wow, thought Max.  He really is brave for a human.  Maybe they are not all bad.  At least, John seems pretty nice. And kind of good looking, too.  For a human.<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by a howl of pain from the beast.  He remembered those shocks well.  They did not feel good.  But it did not seem to be slowing down the large creature at all.  But that didn&#39;t deter the brave John.  He continued to shield Max, and wave his stick at the beast.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Mary backed off.  Apparently, she had no problem harming Max, but did not want to hurt John.  Max followed the beast&#39;s gaze to the bedroom door.  He knew what she planned now.  But Max couldn&#39;t let her get to those vials.  He slipped past John and jumped towards the door just as Mary lunged towards it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; shouted Max, as he slammed the door in front of her.  Max braced himself for Mary&#39;s attack, wincing and closing his eyes.  He was surprised to feel John in front of him.  He was continuing to protect Max, despite the threat.  He felt a new respect for John.  And another feeling.  Almost a longing for him, to be with him and around him. Was it love?<br />
<br />
Mary howled in frustration.  Max didn&#39;t know what to do.   If Mary really wanted the vials, there was nothing either of them could really do to stop her.  Suddenly, he heard sirens, and looked out the large living room window to see several police cars pulling up into the parking lot.  Max knew from his own animal instincts that it was time for the creature to fight or flee.  He prayed that she just ran.<br />
<br />
His prayers were answered as Mary launched herself out the large glass window in the living room.  Max looked down from the window, and saw her land safely on the ground.  He was a little relieved.  He didn&#39;t wish any harm on Mary.  Not really.  True, he didn&#39;t like being hit.  But now that he had his freedom, that was easily forgiven.  He was glad that she had survived. But part of him was a little worried about having a monster like that after him with revenge on its mind.  It gave one last sad look at him, then ran off into the woods.<br />
<br />
Max felt John hugging him tightly.  It made him feel good, safe and protected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, John.  Thank you for your help,&quot; said Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Mary?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
Max sighed.  &quot;It&#39;s been a long day, and I am really tired.  Can we talk about it some other time? Right now I just want to get out of here,&quot; said Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Mary, whatever you say.  You can stay with me, in my apartment, &quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!, &quot; said Max quickly. &quot;Please can we just go somewhere else? I don&#39;t want that thing coming back to get me, and it knows where you live.  Please, John, can you help me?  Just take me somewhere - anywhere - just as long as it is far away from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded, and hugged her tightly.  &quot;Sure, Mary.  I&#39;ll help you.  We&#39;ll do whatever you need to get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max smiled.  Apparently, the females were the Alphas in the human species.  He could easily manipulate John.  But he decided he liked John.  He was brave, strong, and kind.  He would not abuse his new position of authority over his sweet Beta.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, John.  Just let me grab a few things, &quot; said Max as he licked John&#39;s cheek in thanks.  John looked at him strangely, confused by his response.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I guess there are a few more things  I need to learn, thought Max, as he grabbed the box of vials, and followed John out of the apartment.</p>
