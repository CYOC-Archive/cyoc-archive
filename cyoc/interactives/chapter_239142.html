<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Run down to the pet store after school and buy a cage, and set it up in my room,&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;For yourself,&quot; said Ryan, who turned and walked out.<br />
<br />
Jake rolled his eyes, but went about his morning routine. He was surprised for a second as he tried to step out of his bed and immediately dropped to his hands and knees. Right, Ryan had told him to crawl at home. He crawled over to his dresser to get clean clothes out, and found he could reach the top drawer from the floor, so he couldn&#39;t even stand for that.<br />
<br />
Jake, fully clothed, eventually crawled his way down to the front door, and sat on his ass to put his shoes on. Ryan was already there, ready to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a blowjob before we go,&quot; said Ryan, as Jake was putting his shoes on.<br />
<br />
Jake obeyed, the slave collar forcing him into it, and soon his mouth once again tasted his little brother&#39;s semen.<br />
<br />
Jake wondered if he could even cum anymore, but the fact that he now had an undescended nut sack indicated probably not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you going to let me, you know, get off?&quot; asked Jake, as they were walking to school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Ryan was abrupt, and it was infuriating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Jake asked, voice raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the salesguy said slaves were happier if they took time off from doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake started to talk, but Ryan told him to shut up until they got to school. Jake had dreamed of being able to shut his brother up with a command, and now it was the other way around.<br />
<br />
At school, his brother&#39;s command to pee sitting down was starting to get on his nerves. Before gym class, he had to sit in the bathroom stall, pissing like a girl, and holding his hairless prepubescent dick. It felt weird. No one seemed to notice that he was peeing sitting down and not taking a dump, so at least he didn&#39;t get teased for it.<br />
<br />
The worst thing was gym class. He could change quickly without anyone noticing his shrunken genitals, but after class, sweating from running laps, he couldn&#39;t skip showering. The gym teacher was strict on that point, checking students off a list as they went into the shower.<br />
<br />
Jake wrapped himself in a towel before taking his clothes off, and he tried showering as close to the wall as possible. Unfortunately, that drew attention from his best friend Mike , who was kind of bad at reading social cues sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiding a boner, Jake?&quot; asked Mike , not even lowering his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away,&quot; said Jake, turning away. Mike leaned in to check.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, you shaved your pubes?&quot; Mike asked. Jake had hoped the potion would make its affects seem normal to everyone, the way the slave collar did, but no such luck. Soon everyone wanted to take a look, and even Alex, the nerdy late-bloomer who had as much hair as Ryan, came over to laugh at him.<br />
<br />
Jake ignored them, not sure what he could say, but he was embarrassed and felt like a freak. He finished his shower without cleaning as thoroughly as he normally did, and wrapped the towel around his waste. The gym teacher had a curious look on his face as he watched Jake head to his locker.  <br />
<br />
After school, Jake obediently bought a big dog cage, as big as they had, and bought a dog bed too, just in case he really did have to sleep in it. It was a depressing thought, but he had to be realistic.<br />
<br />
It was a struggle to carry the big cardboard box home, but his body was on autopilot so he didn&#39;t have to force himself, Ryan was supplying the willpower.<br />
<br />
His arms and back were killing him when he got home, but he had to set the cage up in Ryan&#39;s room, so his labors weren&#39;t over. Ryan was already home, kicking back and playing Minecraft. Jake couldn&#39;t believe the kid wasn&#39;t tired of that game yet.<br />
<br />
Jake finished setting the cage up, and threw the dog bed inside. Without saying anything to Ryan, he tried to slip out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, try it out,&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you, master,&quot; said Jake, getting to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, any time you go in the cage, you should be naked,&quot; said Ryan. &quot;And never bring your phone into the cage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake glared at his little brother, but dutifully took off his clothes, make a neat pile with his underwear on top. Nude, ass in the air, he crawled inside. Apparently &quot;try it out&quot; included closing the door, at least in Jake&#39;s mind, so he closed the door and slid the bolt in place, which wasn&#39;t easy since he had to wedge his fingers through the wire cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, and when you&#39;re in the cage, you aren&#39;t allowed to open the door, someone else has to open it for you.&quot; His little brother giggled seeing Jake glare at him from his sitting position in the cage. It was the biggest cage they&#39;d had, but it was still cramped and awkward and there wasn&#39;t even enough room to crouch, let alone stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to let me out, master?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, maybe later,&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
Jake huffed, leaning back to pout. Stupid little brother. This was so unfair!<br />
<br />
When their mom called them down for dinner, Jake was left in the cage, Ryan leaving with only a single gloating look towards Jake, who was starving from all his work.<br />
<br />
When Ryan eventually got back, he had a bowl of water, and a bowl of mashed potatoes, which he opened the cage door to set inside, then closed it again, leaving Jake still trapped inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you&#39;re in the cage, you can only eat and drink with your mouth, no hands,&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Ryan, can&#39;t you take this collar off yet?&quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
Jake, feeling like a toy for Ryan&#39;s amusement, got on his hands and knees, and bent his face down to eat his mashed potatoes, getting butter and potato all over his face in the process, which then mingled with the water in his bowl when he slurped water from it. Jake heard the sound of Ryan&#39;s camera snapping a picture, and he turned to glare at Ryan, who then took another picture, and Jake knew it&#39;d show him with a smear of potato around his mouth and nose.<br />
<br />
Jake finished licking the bowl clean, and slurped up the rest of the water, feeling like he still hadn&#39;t gotten enough to eat, but he refused to ask Ryan for more food. He&#39;d wait until he got out of the cage, then get something else from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
His mom entered the room then, tutting seeing Jake with food on his face. She had brought napkins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan said you were playing in your new cage,&quot; she said, making Jake go red from embarrassment. She stuffed some napkins through the cage, and Jake wipe his face with them. &quot;I swear Jake, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re into these games, but I&#39;m not going to interrupt you having a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake knew it was pointless to ask her to let him out, he couldn&#39;t have her thinking this was unwilling. &quot;Go away mom, leave us alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
She huffed and left, leaving her son trapped in a cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you let me out now?&quot; asked Jake. &quot;I&#39;m trapped in a cage with no lock, very funny, now can I go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I let you out,&quot; said Ryan, &quot;There&#39;s one more thing...&quot;</p>
