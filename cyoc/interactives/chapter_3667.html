<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jenny stood in the corral her thoughts of a short stay as a horse now dashed by her loss and Simon's find of the medallion. A cool wet slurp brought her back to reality as she turned to see yet another horny mule asking for some fun.
<br />

<br />
Turning round she walked back into the center of the corral and proceeded to nickker with the jennie mule. The smell of the mules were at first inviting but as she indulged they seem beneath her status in the equine kingdom.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile Simon ran to the dig with his new found treasure.          Professor stood amoung the piles to unearthed useless objects that his students had removed from the tombs. &quot;Professor, called a thrilled Simon!&quot; Out of breath and barely able to speak he told his short story of where he had found the silver medallion.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Very good find there Simon but I think this must be someone's joke. I see varied writings and all of it points to the center blue stone as being a wishing well. Why don't you keep it as a momento of our dig, suggested the Professor.&quot;
<br />

<br />
As happy as Simon was he felt a little let down the medallion wasn't something very special. Clipping the clasp he put it around his neck. The Professor went back to business and gave simon a box of small items to be taken back to the camp for closer examination.
<br />

<br />
Simon a strong young red headed man still covered with healthy freckles hoisted the box against his chest and sent off for the camp. As he walked the medallion seemed to have a funny vibration to it that tickled his chest as he walked along.
<br />

<br />
Finally he reached the camp and placed the big wooden box aside the Professor's tent. Looking at the sun's position he expexted the return of the students soon. Normally they would all work till near sunset and then skurry back through the forest and get to camp before the trails became dangerous.
<br />

<br />
As the evening meal was done the Professor was first to ask, &quot;Anyone seen Jenny today?&quot; The students all began to question eachother but other than Simon nobody had seen her all day.
<br />

<br />
Al was the first to suggest we form up teams of three's and go search, but the Professor was against it due to any dangers of the forest. It was decided to they would wait till morning.
<br />

<br />
Simon sat on the edge of his cot and thought how he acked toward Jenny. Although she was mostly the biggest bitchy person at camp she had a nice personality when at school. &quot;Gee I wish to be Jenny's best friend during her stay here, and even comfort her when she's bored, OUCH!&quot;
<br />

<br />
A jolt of a shock spouted from the medallion and the blue stone began to glow. Simon looked out into the camp as the last tent light winked out. He wanted to speak but his body was stiff as he kept recieving more shocks from the medallion.
<br />

<br />
A pain in his head started to build and soon he squeezed his eues tight shut as if to help hold back his pain. Minutes turned into an hour and then two as Simon was racked in strange pains and muscle contortions. As the pain seemed to flow down and out of his body he opened his eyes.
<br />

<br />
His head was against the top of his tent, this was very strange since he had propped it extra high due to his height. Arms as legs felt stiff and he rolled around till he boosted himself to stand on all fours. Looking up he found his head still touched the top of his tent. He seemed just fine but something was wrong but he couldn't put a finger on just what.  
<br />

<br />
Feeling nervous about the medallions glow and his pains and stiffness he felt something move behind him. Turning his head he looked behind himself is a quick move. There stretching out was a roan hairy back and large hind quarters of the horse he now was. The touching came from his nervous tail flicking almost without thought.
<br />

<br />
Strange and feeling now very strong of will he stepped out of his tent and looked about the camp. Except for the fire all tents were dark. At first he thought to wake the Professor but how could he explain who he was, horses don't talk in English!
<br />

<br />
A big horsey sniff of the air suggested friends might be just to the East of camp. Simon walked and then once his locomotion felt fine he trotted over to the corral. The smell of the mules turned his friendly sense to a rather unfriendly sort of idea. Yet the smell of the stallion seemed to give a pleasure, &quot;Must be since he's a horse and not a mule, thought Simon.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Stepping to the corral gate he pulled the bolt with his big front teeth. Opening the gate he trotted in and turned around and rebolted the gate as a curtious jesture to keep the mules from walking off.
<br />

<br />
Turning again he found himself muzzel to muzzel with the stallion. the big animal a stood a good two feet higher than Simon began to nickker along Simon's withers and flanks. Simon felt fear well up in his chest and at the same time felt a sensual desire.
<br />

<br />
The stallion who was Jenny snuffed at the rump of Simon the horse. As Simon looked over his withers and long roan back the inner horse instinct rouse out of his horse body. Suddenly he saw his tail lift and fall to one side. Taking a half step forward he spread his hind legs a little. This all was so strange and he turned to look away and as he did noticed four female mules standing with tails set to one side too.</p>
