Disclaimer: This story branch takes material from the &quot;... what just happened&quot; option and the &quot;Jen the Queen&quot; option by sneme and combine it into one option. This story branch will also have some original material to smooth things out. The reason for this combined story branch is to make a more streamlined story line. I mean no offense or disrespect to the original writers. This is simply a attempt to make the best of both worlds. <br />

....I&#39;m the biggssssestsss losssssser insss Townsssss! I&#39;mss Georgesss Wasssssshingssstonsss!!! I wasssssn&#39;tss invsssolved insss pantssssing Kylessss! I&#39;msss thesss Presssssidentsss of ssthe Unitedssss Mexssssican Sssssstatessss!,&quot; she said triumphantly, not knowing what to expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments passed and whatever pride she felt deflated out into a pit of dread. She just said the most lies anyone has done EVER. (In hindsight this is probably her dumbest move EVER) And worst of all, she doesn&#39;t know what or WHEN the transformations are going to happen. She just assumed that every time she lies, she becomes a monster more and more. It happen before, so it will probably happen again. She just spent a good chunk of the day spouting lie after lie after lie after lie until her throat got sore. So far, nothing has happened while she was lying, but WHO KNOWS what will happen to her NOW. The best she could do now is hide in the house away from society, and HOPE she could take care of herself from now on. Any thoughts of revenge for Kyle or anyone else died away and was replaced by the oppressive feeling of regret and grief. She was just a follower of the &quot;True&quot; ringleader of the cheerleader squad. So why is she of all people becoming the monster she truly is?<br />
<br />
Jenifer was cold from all of the running and lying on the porch. So with some difficulty,  she managed to navigate her huge antlers through the doorway and inside the abandoned house. She saw a nice and round hole in the middle of the living room with hole in the roof above it. The placement of the two holes looks a little TOO convenient to be natural, but Jen didn&#39;t care. The hole in the ground is right under some sunlight. This is the PERFECT spot  to get warmer, but as soon as she stepped on the natural dirt underneath, she had some... unwanted effects. <br />
<br />
Her toes spread out and broke apart, going into the ground to soak up some nice, oh so deserved water. Jen felt like she was in the presence of a godly substance (AKA light) but when she tried to move to another place, she found that she couldn&#39;t move at all!  Right then and there, she looked down at what&#39;s wrong with her feet. Her fears was confirmed as she saw that her feet was replaced by roots, that of a weed&#39;s! If Jen knows her weeds right, she knows that her feet are probably already deeply rooted into the ground. In a sharp pang of sorrow, Jen realized that she will stuck on this lonely spot for the rest of her life. The only way to leave now is to bearing the pain of ripping her feet from the ground, and the least she wants to do is to deal with more pain. So she simply sat there in the sunlight, waiting for her fate as a hideous monster to begin. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have long to wait as she realized the room around her was growing... or her body was shrinking? Jen is getting very worried of what kind of change she is going through now. She didn&#39;t have long to wait as she caught sight of herself on one of the broken pieces of glass on the floor boards. Besides from the now cuter animal parts, she looks exactly like her five year old self from one of her home videos. Did the curse just make her younger? Even more so, her skin looks a little... green....<br />
<br />
However, she didn&#39;t have time to consider this new development as she  felt a discomfort in her groin. &quot;Oh, oh no,&quot; she panicked as it picked up in intensity. She looked down as her saggy pants  fell to the ground, revealing that her vagina  grew out into a tan growth expanding from her torso. She began to cry as she felt her panties tear off, leaving her naked from the waist down. &quot;Well, I am a wretched beast now, I might as well fit the part,&quot; she said, pulling off her oversized shirt and bra and leaving them at the side. She is now a naked beast and she knows it.<br />
<br />
Soon she felt her new growth reach the ground, surprising her with a sudden bolt of pleasure as she felt it continue to grow. It seemed to expand forever, she felt it bunch up against the wall behind her!<br />
<br />
*CRASH*<br />
<br />
The weight of her new &quot;tail&quot; crushed the wall behind her, expanding into the backyard. &quot;Well, I guess I don&#39;t have to worry about not being able to feel the breeze anymore,&quot; Jen sighed. After several more crashes, and what felt like hours, her new tail was finally done. Luckily, Jen was in one of those countryside houses that has a wide acre backyard and lots of trees that hides it from the outside world. She doesn&#39;t know how far this house is from the town of Glendale, but hopefully far enough. Jen can only assume those crashes were from the poor trees that got in the way of her giant flesh doesn&#39;t reveal her location. Come to think of it, it was a miracle she managed to run as far off from town as she did; wherever this house is.<br />
<br />
Jen was confused, she could feel the flesh&#39;s weight shift as she felt like she was constantly pushing things out of her vagina. She peered behind her, and practically had a heart attack!<br />
<br />
She was met with a huge lump, emerging from between her legs and extending almost 50 feet behind her! She watched as it pulsed, she felt it push and squelch behind her. She attempted to move back to see what she was pushing out, feeling her massive snout nudge against her pulsing mass, but she couldn&#39;t move!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohssss, thisssss isssss jusssssst GREATSSSSS!&quot; Jen called out, lying, as she certainly did not think this was great.<br />
<br />
She felt a tugging feeling on her crotch and looked at it, and still horrified at the fact that she was unable to move and then &quot;Rip-pp&quot; there was a dick on her (or lets say, his) crotch. He/she knew what this meant... but he still technically have a vagina on the end of her pulsing sac, so does this mean he is a she or she is a he?!?!<br />
<br />
Jen was so confused by the male pheromones coming from his cock. His cock is were his vagina used to be so does that make him a guy now? .<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;msss asss monsssster withssss nosss hopesssss ofsss regainingssss mysss humanityssss. I&#39;msss a monstersssss withssss ssssno hopesssss ofsss regainingsss my humanityssss. I&#39;msss a monsssster sssswith nosss ssshopes of regainingssss myssss humanitssssy. I&#39;mssss a monsterssss withsss nossss hopesssss ofssss regainingssss mysss humanityssss. I&#39;m a monsssssster withsssss nos hopessss sofsss regainingssss myssss humannnniiiiwwwaaaaaaasssssssssssss........&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As he repeated this mantra over and over again, Jenifer slowly found tears streaming from his small body. Here he is, a monster stuck in a hole in the middle of a abandoned house in the middle of nowhere. There&#39;s no one to help him... not even Susan. He&#39;s all alone, and now that the monster curse took a break from changing him, he began to realize how much she missed his mommy and daddy.... He wants to go home, &quot;wahhhhhhhhssssssssssssssssss!!!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jenifer&#39;s younger body is not just struggling with her gender identity but also his age mentality.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s going to happen to Jenifer now?<br />
<br />
