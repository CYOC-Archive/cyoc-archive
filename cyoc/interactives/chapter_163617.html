<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Steven thought as he walked. His bare feet squirmed on the concrete ground. Every so often a passerby would give him a funny look. He kept his hands in his pockets, holding up the sweats so his penis couldn&#39;t easily be seen through them. &quot;This fucking sucks!&quot; Steven repeated. He had no idea where these words were coming from. They just felt like something he could say now. He turned around and walked onto a dirt road. It lead directly under a bridge, which gave Steven the best place to hide from watchful eyes. &quot;Finally!&quot; Steven said as he sat down. He picked up his foot and saw that it was completely covered in dirt and pebbles. &quot;Gross!&quot; Steven put it down and started thinking his next plan of action.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I gonna do now?&quot; he thought. &quot;I can&#39;t tell my parents. Like even if they believed me, that perv might do something to them.&quot; The thought of his mom and dad being turned into old people or babies made him shudder. &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot; Steven was lost in thought. &quot;There is someone, but can I convince him?&quot; Steven then realized there was one person who could help him now; his childhood friend, Thomas. They had known each other for as long as he could remember. Steven knew things about him that no one else did, which would make it easier to get Tom to believe him. &quot;I don&#39;t have any other choice do I?&quot; Steven took the one chance he had and texted him first. &quot;Hey dude. Don&#39;t be surprised by what you see, but I need to talk to you.&quot; He hit send and waited. After several dozen seconds, he got a text back. &quot;Steven, is this you? Where have you been?! You&#39;re parents are going ballistic!&quot; Steven checked his phone. The time read 6:10. His parents were both definitely home by now. &quot;I can imagine, but I need to talk with you alone. Please go somewhere alone.&quot; He sent another text and waited again. This time the phone rang. Steven took a deep breath and hit talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m alone, but what are you... Who the heck are you?!&quot; &quot;Tom! Tom, wait its me! It&#39;s Steven!&quot; &quot;What the... Hey, who are you and what did you do with my friend?!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m serious here! It&#39;s really me! This scientist guy...!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m calling the cops!&quot; Tom motioned to end the call. &quot;Wait, wait, wait! Listen! When you were five, you told me that you actually loved to eat vegetables.&quot; As soon as he said that, Tom paused. &quot;... And what was my favorite one?&quot; After a brief pause Tom asked back. &quot;Broccoli.&quot; &quot;I like to sing?&quot; &quot;The Spongebob theme song. You sing it way too much when we&#39;re alone.&quot; &quot;Favorite Color?&quot; &quot;Red&quot; &quot;And where&#39;s my birth mark?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s... on your left butt-cheek.&quot; Tom paused once again and after what seemed like an eternity, finally asked, &quot;Steven... Is that really you?&quot; &quot;Yes! Oh thank fucking god! Yes!&quot; He was successful. &quot;What happened to you? You look like your dad!&quot; Steven then began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow! That sounds amazing!&quot; was the first thing Thomas said after he heard the story. &quot;Trust me. It was fucking horrifying!&quot; &quot;You even sound like a grown-up now... So? What do you want me to do?&quot; &quot;I need help. I need some money to stay until we can figure out how to change me back. And I need some underwear and socks. That perv scientist didn&#39;t give me any. I&#39;m going commando here!&quot; &quot;And just how am I gonna do that? What do I tell my parents?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know. Tell them you left some thing at school. It should still be open right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; &quot;Look I know I&#39;m asking a lot, but I don&#39;t wanna be here in the dark. Please help me. I&#39;m scared!&quot; &quot;Sigh... Okay, I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot; &quot;Oh thank you! Thank you! Also, get me a washcloth. My feet are all dirty.&quot; He lifted his foot up once more. &quot;Ew! Gross!&quot; &quot;I know, right?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Steven told Tom where he was. It was a place they played at a lot, so he knew Tom could find it. After about a half hour, Steven could see Tom arrive. &quot;Hey Tom! I&#39;m over here!&quot; Tom saw him and rushed over. &quot;Wow! I saw you from the phone, but you&#39;re ginormous, dude!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t remind me... Anyway, did you bring the stuff I asked for?&quot; &quot;I did one better. I got you a full set of clothes!&quot; &quot;Oh thanks! You&#39;re a real life saver!&quot; Tom handed him a towel. He dipped the tip of it in the water below, and washed the dirt of his feet and then dried it with the dry end. Soon after he put on socks. After having been barefoot for so long, the socks felt almost heavenly. &quot;That feels so good! God!&quot; He got up again. His socks would get a little more dirty, but that was fine with him. &quot;Hey could you turn around? I want to get dressed.&quot; &quot;No way, dude! I need to see this!&quot; &quot;No way! Are you high?!&quot; &quot;Come on, we&#39;re both guys! What&#39;s the harm, bro?!&quot; &quot;I... I... Ugh, all right! But its not THAT impressive.&quot; Steven first took his pants off, his six inch cock flopped out into the open air. Thomas&#39; jaw dropped. &quot;Oh.. my... GOD! It&#39;s huge!&quot; &quot;Ugh! Don&#39;t just stare at it! That&#39;s gross!&quot; As he tried to cover his modesty, it started to straighten out. &quot;Hey, is your pee-pee growing?&quot; Tom asked. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; Steven said. Remembering what happened before, he quickly grabbed the pair of boxers and covered it up. Doing that seemed to calm it down. &quot;Oh thank god! I was about to get an erection again!&quot; &quot;Erection? Is that what that was?&quot; &quot;Uh, never mind!&quot; Steven quickly said as he adjusted his boxers to accommodate his dick. His pubic hairs shown through a bit, but putting on pants took care of that anyway. He then put on the shoes, so he could fully get his feet off the ground. Lastly he took off his shirt. &quot;Woah!&quot; Tom said. &quot;You look like one of those body builders they show on TV. &quot;You think?&quot; Steven flexed a bit. &quot;Hngh! Hmph!&quot; After a few seconds, he stopped and put on his shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;These are my Dad&#39;s clothes, so they might feel a little loose.&quot; &quot;They&#39;re better then nothing though.&quot; The shirt hung slightly off his body and he had to tighten the drawstrings of his pants, but he could make due. &quot;Now where am I gonna go?&quot; &quot;Got you covered!&quot; Tom took out a map and pointed to a spot. &quot;There&#39;s motel here that&#39;s super cheap. It&#39;s like 50 bucks a day and I&#39;ve got 130 buck here. So it should get you to the day after tomorrow with some left for food.&quot; &quot;130 bucks! Where did you get that?!&quot; &quot;From my Dad&#39;s rainy day fund stuff. He won&#39;t miss it, so don&#39;t worry. Unless you wanna stay the night here?&quot; &quot;Oh hell no! I&#39;ll take the motel!&quot; &quot;Good. It&#39;s about a mile away so you should get there in ten minutes or so. I need to get back though. So I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at about 4, so make sure you&#39;re in the motel by then.&quot; &quot;Got it! And thanks dude! I&#39;d hug you if I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d crush ya!&quot; &quot;Uh, don&#39;t mention it? Anyway, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!&quot; Thomas said as he left. &quot;Well then... time to become an adult for realsies!&quot; Steven said to himself as he made the trek to the motel.</p>
