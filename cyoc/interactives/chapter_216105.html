<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck looked up from his computer and asked the zoned out boys some questions. &quot;So, what&#39;s the deal with the matching underwear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt looked at him with lidded eyes and said, &quot;They are our temple garments. They are a symbol of our commitment to the teachings of the church.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot; Chuck said dismissively. <br />
<br />
&quot;No it isn&#39;t,&quot; piped up Aaron, &quot;it&#39;s just like the special clothes any other religion has. They also help with modesty. We always wear them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Modesty. I&#39;ve never seen much good in that virtue.&quot; Chuck said, the smile breaking on his lips. <br />
<br />
He typed bit and both boys froze. As they stopped moving, Chuck used his cursor to vanish all the clothes the two were wearing. <br />
<br />
He scoffed mockingly at the two sleeping nineteen year olds. Neither of these boys had much to brag about, much less, be modest about. Flaccid, average circumcised cocks, Wyatt&#39;s blonde pubes were different but they were both so basic. Even for guys who rode bikes everywhere, their legs weren&#39;t even that toned. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s ok. Chuck thought to himself, by the time he was done with them, they&#39;d have plenty to show off.  <br />
<br />
Chuck turned his attention to Aaron.  He looked at the sad little cock and balls he had and began to move sliders around.  When he finally hit enter, Aaron definitely had something to show off.  His fat, heavy cock now drooped. The dark purple head of the nine inch log was now partially hooded by a newly regrown foreskin.  The tip now glistened with a slowly pulsing stream of precum. Beneath his cock were a pair of heavy balls in a low-slung ballsack.  <br />
<br />
Seeing his work so close at hand, so near to him for the first time, Chuck couldn&#39;t help himself.  He set his computer down and steeling himself, he reached out and cupped the balls of the frozen elder. He felt their weight as the twin orbs overflowed his palm.  <br />
<br />
Then, he remembered. these boys weren&#39;t the object of countless hours of observation and adoration.  <br />
<br />
They were just interlopers.  They had just kept him from watching the Wilson boys live out one of his dreams. <br />
<br />
Chuck pulled his hand back as if it had been bit.  This sent Aaron&#39;s balls swinging pendulously. A stronger gush of precum gushed out of his tip as Chuck backpedaled to the laptop. <br />
<br />
Chuck stepped back to his computer.  &quot;Hmm. Modesty.&quot; he mumbled.  <br />
<br />
Chuck reversed some of his previous inputs and the magic underwear and clothes reappeared on Elder Aaron.  This time, with a barely noticeable dark spot on his now stuffed crotch.  <br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t good enough, Chuck thought to himself.  &quot;Modest is hottest&quot; is only something the ugly or repressed said to themselves. <br />
<br />
Chuck made a few clicks and the bulge in Aaron&#39;s pants became more defined.  The obstructing long underwear now gone forever.  Aaron had never worn underwear.  It wasn&#39;t his style.  Free-balling was the only way to be.  <br />
<br />
Still, seeing Arron in the khaki slacks was a little underwhelming.  Equipment like his deserved to be on display. <br />
<br />
Scrolling through clothing options, Chuck recalled something he had seen on message boards.  Silkies.  The olive green short shorts that marines used to wear.  It was rumored that every one of them would buy a couple sizes too small.  But Arron&#39;s would be three sizes too small.  <br />
<br />
Chuck hit submit and now the young man was standing before him, his slightly sagging dress socks and his legs bare between his his calves to the top third of his thighs.  Still, his enhanced package was covered by the synthetic fabric.  The wet spot of his dripping cock remained. <br />
<br />
Chuck clicked through options and drop-down menus and finally found an option that he needed.  He clicked the check box for &quot;EXHIBITIONIST&quot; and then hit the slider to 70%. <br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s shirt shrunk both tighter and shorter, putting his slight belly on display.  His shoes morphed into simple slides. His shorts dropped lower on his hips so that the root of his bigger cock was visible along with a nest of brunette pubes. <br />
<br />
Chuck smiled. Now the boy was on display. Modesty be damned. <br />
<br />
Of course, showing off wasn&#39;t the same as advertisement.  Chuck grimaced and then found the helpful menu under the clothes selection that said &quot;PRURIENCITY&quot; and slid that all the way to the top. <br />
<br />
Instead of clothes that merely covered less, Arron was now dressed in clothes that suggested sex. Instead of an unfitting button down, he was now wearing a midriff bearing stringer tank that said, &quot;BIG&quot; followed by an image of a rooster.  It exposed his arms but more importantly included an arrow down to his enhanced endowment, highlighting his navel and exposed treasure trail. <br />
<br />
Chuck noticed with satisfaction that one of the big balls had slipped out of the shorts Aaron was wearing and was now trapped below the tight leg of the slippery shorts. <br />
<br />
However, looking over the totality of the changed person in front of him, he noticed certain deficiencies. His farmers tan led to patches of paleness, and his slim, flabby frame left nothing to ogle except the bulge in his pants.  <br />
<br />
Chuck was getting bored and he found another option in the body modifications that he hadn&#39;t noticed before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;PULCHRITUDE&quot;<br />
<br />
By sliding the line item from 15% to 30%, Chuck saw the young man&#39;s muscles bulge, his skin darken, and his jawline sharpen.  <br />
<br />
Moving the slider to 70%, he finally saw what he wanted to see, a man so beautiful that his clothes were an affront to his perfection.  Aaron&#39;s muscles bulged, his pecs creating a shelf that held the stringer taught in all the right places, his arms expanding to a muscled but smooth perfection. Chuck drew in his breath as he noticed the abs and cum gutters that appeared on Aaron&#39;s torso. <br />
<br />
His thighs and calves expanded showing heightened muscle, and pushing the already tight shorts to the limit of their coverage.  <br />
<br />
His feet appeared, elongated, now covered in mere slides as his body grew and stretched the limits on the allowed coverage of his body.  <br />
<br />
Chuck smiled as he saw the young man before him. Formerly, the picture of modesty and piety, he was now exalted to the himbo ideal. A bro who<br />
Couldn&#39;t help but show off his looks with a dick that nearly demanded attention. <br />
<br />
Aaron couldn&#39;t move but he stood with a certain swagger that Chuck couldn&#39;t help but admire.  His immodest creation, a pure and in the flesh vision of his own lust. Chuck himself felt swayed by his masculine beauty.  <br />
<br />
He checked Aaron&#39;s numbers on the Kinsey scale and dialed his surprising 3 up to five. <br />
<br />
He also adjusted his &quot;DEDICATED SUBJECTION&quot; to 90% with the focus on himself. <br />
<br />
Aaron was now a perfect, hung, himbo, for Chuck&#39;s use.  <br />
<br />
He hit activate on Aaron&#39;s icon and watched the young man move into action.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron how are you feeling?&quot; Chuck asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling great!&quot; Aaron said, reaching down to pull his right ball back up into his shorts while simultaneously exposing an equal percentage of his hips and the root of his cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great.&quot; Chuck said, his smile broadening while still typing on his computer.  <br />
<br />
Arron smiled dimly, his dumb jock look heightening by the awkward pause but his own silence hinging on his desire to please the man before him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do remember that you&#39;re my nephew?&quot; Chuck said. <br />
<br />
Aaron didn&#39;t. He remembered riding a bicycle and ending up here somehow but the rest was an uncertain haze.  He remembered a bicycle and coming here for some reason but, in his memory, he was dressed differently and felt differently. Instead of following his gut and saying no, Aaron found himself agreeing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;m your nephew.&quot; He said confidently, wanting to agree with the middle aged man before him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that you and I were here to discuss your boyfriend, and what you wanted me to change about him.&quot; Chuck said confidently.  <br />
<br />
Aaron hesitated again he didn&#39;t want to disbelieve his uncle but he also didn&#39;t feel 100% about what he was being told. &quot;I don&#39;t know, he said, I remember coming here for a reason but I can&#39;t remember.   I remember riding all the way here with my dick out so if that&#39;s what you say, it must have been important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck gasped but then he remembered the qualifications he had set without limits on Aaron&#39;s clothing allowance.  If he had wanted to cover his head with a helmet, he must have felt the need to uncover another. If Chuck wasn&#39;t careful, a ski trip could  result in truly unfortunate frostbite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it was serious, you came to me to see how I could help you with your boyfriend. You know that I have great advice. Let me help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
The now mostly gay exhibitionist Aaron looked at the frozen and naked Wyatt and sighed as all the missing pieces in his mind fell into an orderly place. His permanently leaking cock had slipped out of his shorts and dribbled a little rivulet of pre on the floor.   &quot;Thank goodness.  I don&#39;t  know who else t<br />
I would go to for help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck sighed dramatically and said, &quot;I&#39;m the only relative who&#39;s supported you since you came out.&quot;<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t feel right. Nothing felt right to Aaron but he almost felt he had to agree to his uncle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re in my life.&quot; Aaron said, giving a wide smile and scratching his exposed abs in front of this (unknown to him) relative stranger.</p>
