<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time passed quickly, the daily routine both easy and comfortable.  Derrick took pleasure in serving his Centaur, and the total lack of worry.  He knew what to do and did it, content and often not even really thinking of anything at all.  So it was something of a shock when his Centaur came back from the resort with a human male who stared at him a moment, then said &quot;Derrick, it&#39;s time to go home.  Vacation&#39;s over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words triggered a return of memories, knowledge, and intelligence that made Derrick stagger a moment before he blinked and grinned.  &quot;Dad! It&#39;s been two weeks already?  Wow!&quot;  The words were a little difficult to pronounce, and his voice was odd - rumbly and higher-pitched.  Oh, right.  He was a horse-boy.  Turning to his Centaur, Derrick hugged the larger being hard.  &quot;Thank you!  I loved it here!&quot;<br />
<br />
His Centaur hugged him back and then stroked his head and ears.  &quot;I will miss you very much.  You are the best stable companion I have ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick felt a pang of sorrow leaving the beautiful centaur, but his Dad frowned and gestured.  &quot;Come on,son.  We have to get you back to normal before we leave for the airport.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back to normal?  Derrick was puzzled, but then remembered what he had looked like as a human.  Other stable boys nodded to him as he walked out, and they looked normal, handsome even.  The young teenager he had been was puny, weak in comparison.  Well, he couldn&#39;t go back home like this.  Though he&#39;d make a great football player with this bulk and size.<br />
<br />
They found their way back to the main reception area where Derricks Mom and sister were waiting by the luggage.  His mother looked unhappy, but his sister grinned.  &quot;I like you way better like that, Derrick.&quot;  He realized she had come to visit him during the vacation, though he&#39;d reacted to her more as a dog to a human.  <br />
<br />
His Dad led him to a side chamber where a woman in white robes waited.  &quot;Hello, Derrick.  My, you certainly make a fine stable boy.  I also understand you have been a hard worker and faithful companion.  As a reward, your family is being credited with a full refund of your vacation fees.&quot;  His Dad smiled at that.  &quot;And you are welcome to return here free of charge any time.&quot;  That surprised both of them.    &quot;But now it is time to restore you so you can go back with your family.  Come intot he bath.  Your clothing is already prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
They followed the woman into a chamber with a large, deep pool of clear water.  Derrick&#39;s hooves clopped on the marble floor, and he saw that the walls were all mirrored.  He admired his reflection - the powerful humanoid equine so strong, sturdy, handsome.  The massive sexual equipment had provided a lot of pleasure, and he&#39;d really miss that.<br />
<br />
Following directions, Derrick stepped into the pool and moved to the center as she followed.  Using a gold bucket, she began to dip water from the pool and pour it over him, having to reach up  to sluice the water over his head.  The water was warm, and it felt really nice.  He started to come erect, and absently rubbed the shaft that pushed out of his sheath.  Something else he would miss.<br />
<br />
The bathing continued, and he relaxed and waited for the change.  It wasn&#39;t until after he shuddered in what he expected to be his final release and shot a load of equine semen across the pool that he realized the woman was frowning.  &quot;Oh, sorry.   We do this in the stable a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  &quot;Oh, masturbation is no problem.  You should have changed back by now.  But you look the same - if anything, I&#39;d say you looked even more like one of the stable boys now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Puzzled, Derrick checked out the mirrors.  Strange.  It was still him, but there really was something different.  Something about his expression, his face, his...  eyes.  That was it.  When he had come in here, his eyes had been somehow different - more intelligent?  Now his expression was relaxed, and slightly dull looking.  It did not bother him at all.<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s father scowled.  &quot;Why is this taking so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman shrugged.  &quot;The new form usually washes away in a minute or so.  I have never had to go so long before, and I think he is actually slightly more changed than before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot;  Derrick&#39;s Father shouted.  &quot;Change him back!  Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman continued for a few more minute, with no changes apparent.  Finally, she stopped and asked &quot;Derrick, do you want to stay like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He answered without thinking about it.  &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; It was like being asked if the sun came up or grass was green.<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand that if you go home looking like this you will be considered a freak?  A half-horse monstrocity?&quot;  The woman held up a hand to keep his stunned father from saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess.&quot;  Derrick thought about it, then shrugged.  &quot;I don&#39;t care.  I want to stay like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is NOT an option!&quot; shouted his father.<br />
<br />
The woman sighed.  &quot;The choice is Derrick&#39;s.  I can&#39;t change him back if he doesn&#39;t want to be changed.  All magic here is voluntary.  We can cast some acceptance spells that will help others adjust to his appearance, but as long as he is determined, this is a Derrick.  You can go home and suffer the indignities of being very different, or go back to the stables.&quot;</p>
