<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The planned ambush had turned into a chaotic mess. There was never the expectation that the Gambonis would toss tear gas grenades through the bedroom windows that faced the backyard of the Charleston house. The Moon Lake PD carried a stock of them in case of a riot or something of that nature, but given Moon Lake&#39;s small size there was only a small supply of it. In this, as Daniel Brooks came out from his back door to see Vito and Marcus split and run into the woods after trying to coordinate with some of the extra agents that had come as the police and FBI refined things to be ready for it, he was greatly surprised white smoke drifting out through the shattered window that had to be either Moe and Nichole&#39;s bedroom or Karen&#39;s.<br />
<br />
All of this had gone against what the main plan was, as it was hoped that they would catch the Gambonis in the Charleston house as they tried to find their way through the building. Thankfully, tear gas was non lethal and for whatever reason the Gambonis apparently panicked and fled when they heard someone in the Charleston house call on a walkie-talkie that they were under attack. That part was fortunate, and Daniel guessed that Marcus or Vito knew Moe&#39;s voice and when the agent spoke, they recognized the voice as &quot;not Moe.&quot; From there, the two Gamboni brothers fled into the woods with the police and the agents soon chasing them.<br />
<br />
Daniel kept his focus on the younger of the two that he could see, as that had to be Marcus, and sprinted after the man. Normally by this time of night, many of Moon Lake&#39;s weres would probably be up to their normal nighttime activities, and when the whole operation began that was a bit of a concern for Daniel, particularly as so many of these FBI agents were normal humans, which could mean they might not respond well to Moon Lake being largely populated by weres. Thankfully, Moon Lake&#39;s residents on that part of town seemed to remain inside, which limited what danger or damage that the Gambonis could pull. Daniel was also grateful that Marcus had largely fled along a northward route, which would take him in nearly the opposite direction from where they&#39;d moved the Charlestons. Their home and the Brooks home was northeast side of the town while Tara Strange&#39;s cabin was to the southwest of Moon Lake. In this, Daniel was certain that there was no way that Marcus or Vito could stumble onto Tara&#39;s cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice night for a crook chase, eh?&quot; came a female voice from behind Daniel.<br />
<br />
He glanced over his shoulder to see the female agent, Brook Reeds, dashing and dodging through the trees as well. She was a bit more &quot;formally&quot; dressed that fit along with the dress code that FBI agents were to wear, though she did have on a pair of gray running shoes and she managed to shift her weight quite well as the two of them ran after Marcus. Getting through all the trees and bushes wasn&#39;t too bad, at least in the sense that it wasn&#39;t so thick that it would be impossible, but it was thick enough that one would expect that someone not used to the terrain of the area to be a bit uneasy with it. As Marcus seemed to be ahead of them. He periodically stopped, started, juked, jived, and looked around, almost as though he couldn&#39;t tell one tree from another. But Agent Reeds kept pace very well and easily managed to dodge trees and bushes and even hurdle some old fallen timbers that were in the woods that filled the space between the spokes that made up Moon Lake&#39;s streets<br />
<br />
&quot;If it saves old friends of mine, then it is a great night for a crook chase,&quot; Daniel answered and focused on Marcus who seemed turned around but continued to make his way north through the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew the Charlestons?&quot; Agent Reeds asked, &quot;didn&#39;t they originally come from New York?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;as did my wife Fran and I. I came here when the department I was in there downsized due to lack of funding at the time. Moon Lake needed an officer at the time and promised no budget fights, so I transferred here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve lost your accent,&quot; Agent Reeds answered with a smirk and noted that both of them were making good time in chasing Marcus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we moved here at least fifteen years ago... maybe more than that,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;I suppose the accent dies a bit over time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Reeds nodded and then noted a flash as Marcus turned and fired at them. The shot was aimed at her, but thankfully she could see the moonlight glint off the barrel and she dodged before Marcus had a chance to pull the trigger. Daniel dodged in the other direction as soon as the shot was fired. The bullet went between them and hit a tree. Agent Reeds continued to make her way along one path while Daniel slowed enough to stay behind the trees and work his walkie-talkie.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Officer Brooks,&quot; Daniel reported in, &quot;I am with Agent Reed and am in pursuit of Marcus Gamboni... headed north-northeast. Shots have been fired.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the shots had been at range and in panic. Marcus might be good at gunning people down at close range or against those in a clear line of sight, or with an automatic weapon that could let him more easily correct his aim, but this wasn&#39;t that sort of situation. Marcus was running through the woods in the dark of night, he could barely see where he was going and much of his aim had been directed at the sound of the voices he could hear behind him. At the same time, with the fact that he was running for his life and trying to dodge trees, bushes, branches, and other sorts of natural obstacles, his aim was off and in that he figured most of his shots missed their mark by a wide margin, but in the end it was just as good in that as they slowed down a bit, Marcus had the time to try and find his way around.<br />
<br />
Though it didn&#39;t help him all that much. His shots were wild and then he hit his head on a tree branch and fell back onto his rear. That in turn bought Daniel and Agent Reed time. As Marcus rolled over and tried to get up, the two charged him at full speed. They arrived at roughly the same time with Agent Reed tackling Marcus at his left shoulder while Daniel tackled Marcus at his right shoulder. The blows took him too the ground forcing his face down into the leaves. The blow caused him to drop his gun and he found himself unable to break free of their grip while Daniel pulled one arm behind Marcus while kneeling on Marcus&#39;s butt to hold him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus Gamboni, you are under arrest for attempted murder, criminal trespass, assaulting law enforcement, and conspiracy to commit murder,&quot; Daniel said to him as Agent Reed moved the other arm back so that the youngest of the Gamboni brothers was cuffed. From there, Daniel continued with the Miranda Rights.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the FBI has a few charges to add to the list as well,&quot; Agent Reed added as she collected Marcus&#39;s gun and Daniel then stood the man up.<br />
<br />
Once up, Daniel held onto Marcus with one hand and activated his walkie-talkie again, &quot;This is Officer Brooks with Agent Reed. Marcus Gamboni is now in custody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten-Four,&quot; was the dispatch response, &quot;and his shots?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wild and inaccurate,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;Mostly the result of running around in the woods in the dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus only scowled as he heard the police officer laugh at that, and he remained silent as Daniel and Agent Reed walked him all the way back to the area where Vito had parked the car earlier. The car was still there, but it was now joined by a few other police cruisers and other civilian vehicle. He saw Vito in the back of one of the police cars.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll look to hold these two overnight,&quot; Daniel commented to Agent Reed, &quot;you and Agent Baoman can work transporting them to... wherever it is they will be tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be up to the jurisdictional fights over the trial,&quot; Agent Reed answered, &quot;Though... given the murder at Mt. Saint Helens... I think the Seattle Field Office will want to claim first dibs on this one. Anyone else can try him with additional charges if they want. Regardless... I think we have enough that these two will be off the street for quite some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded in agreement to that.</p>
