<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Alex made their way up to the front door of the Anderson home with some friendly teasing and joking, which would be rather typical for sixteen year olds, regardless of whether or not they were dating. It was a way to blow off steam and even have fun in a way and neither Nate nor Alex would have it any other way. For them, things were fairly good and calm. Sure, Seattle was in the middle of dealing with the capture and murder of a rogue wererat who might well have exposed the existence of weres everywhere to humanity, but so far that &quot;nightmare scenario&quot; hadn&#39;t happened yet and thus wasn&#39;t too much of an issue for either young male werewolf. And while Dieter Wilhelm may have sent another agent to try and further his attempts to make Jennifer Harper &quot;his,&quot; neither Nate nor Alex were close to the young newly transformed werevixen and her mate. The world to Nate and Alex was largely each other and their own personal battles, which for the moment would be their homework.<br />
<br />
As they made it to the front door, Nate went to open it and leaned in slightly only to find that the door didn&#39;t budge an inch, indicating that the door was locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t get kicked out, did we?&quot; Alex asked to him as he caught up with Nate. His voice having a slightly teasing tone to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Nate answered and pulled his backpack off his back to begin going through one of the smaller pockets on the outside, &quot;Dad is probably still at school, though his schedule can vary with the class schedules... which he says is dependent on how many people take certain classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But shouldn&#39;t your mom be home?&quot; Alex wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess she had some errands to run,&quot; Nate replied as he found a singular spare key and inserted into the lock on the outside of the door, &quot;and she locked the door to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex only shrugged and then followed Nate in once the door was unlocked. The two then headed upstairs with the intent on working on their homework in Nate&#39;s room. They made their way there, though it soon became a race to get to Nate&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! No fair!&quot; Alex protested as Nate managed to get into his chair first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to need a calculator,&quot; Nate countered, &quot;you just have a worksheet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate then pulled out the center drawer on his desk that was just above his legs. Inside it was a brown clipboard that was made out of plastic. Nate retrieved it from the desk and tossed it to Alex as he took the consolation prize of sitting on Nate&#39;s bed. It bounced off the mattress and then hit Alex&#39;s backpack while he was pulling out a textbook for the history class that all juniors took. Normally things like the books were to be kept in the school, just to make sure that books didn&#39;t get needlessly damaged, but if a student didn&#39;t get finished in class, they could take a book home if they came in at the end of the day and signed on a checkout sheet that the teacher had. Both Alex and Nate had dealt with that, Alex with World History and Nate with Algebra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I got a lot &quot;why&quot; questions answer with regard to the Medieval period,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;Lots of looking back and forth between events to prove a point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve generally found that &quot;why&quot; questions are better answered by good reasoning rather than a lot of dates or facts,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;You can put down a bunch of facts, but if you can&#39;t connect them into a reasoned argument, no one will understand what you&#39;re getting at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I could ask you to tell me how you answered the questions?&quot; Alex wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just told you how I did,&quot; Nate chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m not going to give you what my answers were. I&#39;ll help talk you through your reasoning, if you wish... and that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I can hide how to solve the questions you have trouble with?&quot; Alex teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, algebra is different than history,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;and I can figure it out... I just may need some help here or there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Alex sighed, &quot;Just remember to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there the two of them got into their respective homework assignments. Both figured they did fairly well in terms of making progress as they went, but they did provide some help when the other needed it. They enjoyed some back and forth conversations on things they could do. Nate asked on hunting and Alex commented that hunting was okay, but unless they planned to eat what they hunt, the hunt would need to be catch and release. Nate admitted that with no one home at present that that might have to wait, but he also added that catch and release didn&#39;t necessarily sound like a bad idea. It&#39;d also be something that they could involve Ben in, and even invite Kenya if she was willing to hunt as part of a team the way werewolves commonly did. As they went about this, though, they soon heard the front door open with two female voices being picked up by Nate and Alex&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You left the door unlocked?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice spoke. Neither Nate nor Alex recognized the voice, though Nate thought that he had heard the voice somewhere before.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I locked it,&quot; came Martha&#39;s voice in answer, &quot;Either Nate or Eric came home. Moon Lake sent us house keys for all of us when we went through all the paperwork to buy the house when William was hired at the college here. A little odd, I suppose, but hey... the tour of the house was done online and done well and William and I figured everyone just wanted to be helpful and friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we can be,&quot; came the response with a slightly sexual tone to the comment. &quot;They&#39;ll be okay...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate and Eric should know that William and I are in a more open marriage now to let me enjoy the full width of who and what I am,&quot; was Martha&#39;s answer, &quot;We&#39;ll just need to let them know that I have some company and that it&#39;s private... They&#39;ll then let us be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; was the slow response. It fell off at the end, but still sounded fairly eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom made a friend,&quot; Alex smirked to Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;That she did,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;How are you with your homework?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than halfway,&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nate gave a knowing smile, &quot;What say we go say hello before letting mom have her fun... and while the sun is still out... we could come back here and have some fun of our own before finishing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh,&quot; Alex gave an answer as he got up and began to follow Nate toward his bedroom door.</p>
