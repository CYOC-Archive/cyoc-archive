<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas woke up. The warm light of the sun, gently shining over his face.<br />
Lucas yawned, and strechted out, and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a towel was thrown over his behind, startling the poor boy.<br />
&quot;WHOAH, where, what?!?!&quot; He yelped, as he grabbed the towel and instinctively covered his private parts.<br />
Sandra laughed, &quot;Morning, sleepyhead, how did you sleep? Any problems or issues?&quot; she asked with a smile, she was enjoying the boys embarrassement.<br />
<br />
Lucas gulped, clutching the towel, &quot;Okay I guess? Being smaller was kinda comfy on these cots&quot;, Lucas answered, still half asleep.<br />
After making the comment about is height, it finally dawned on him. He was back to his normal size, his legs were complete bald again, so were his arms, apart from a stretch out bit around his wrists, which was the last fur that remained on his body.<br />
&quot;Hey my fur is gone!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lucas was flabbergasted, before he went to bed he was almost a complete monkey, however now it seemed like he mostly turned back!<br />
&quot;I can see that, that is why I am here sweety&quot; Sandra stated, with the same kind smile on her face she had shown him all this time.<br />
&quot;The pills have worn off, for you, it happens for a couple of people, so we are checking up on everyone to see how they are doing, so far you are the only one whose changes are obviously not permanent!&quot; she said, explaining the situation.<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; He asked in return, wondering what this meant, whilst also fishing for a new pair of boxers.<br />
&quot;So now I am going to take you to our mobile lab, just across the river, near the guide camp, there we will test your blood and see what causes this!&quot; Sandra said, she didn&#39;t waste any time either, as she grabbed Lucas&#39; hands and pulled him up from his bed.<br />
&quot;Whoa, can I first put on some clothes? It is kinda cold!&quot; he quickly protested, seeing how he was still naked from the night before.<br />
&quot;Well you can put them on, but you&#39;ll have to take them off anyway, so it is quicker if we just go now, you&#39;ll probably have your fur back after we are done!&quot; Sandra said, as she pulled the poor naked teen out of his tent, who was still clutching the towel.<br />
He really did almost turn back human, he his body was completely furless apart from his forearms. His feet were back to being feet, although his big toe was still more of a thumb.<br />
And the poor boy no lounger sported the tail he so desperately wanted.<br />
<br />
Whilst the pair was making their way through the monkey camp, Lucas could see plenty of other boys who were still monkeyfied.<br />
One boy&#39;s ears were so large they could block out the sun, whilst his fur covered the entirety of his body, with a long flexible tail that Lucas was once again so jealous of.<br />
Whilst another boy, was just no longer human at all, but a complete monkey, yet he could still talk, and was waving towards Sandra, wishing her goodmorning.<br />
<br />
After a bit of a walk, Lucas and Sandra reached their destination, and Lucas was not gonna lie, it was pretty underwhelming.<br />
Having imagined a full laboratory like facility, instead it looked more like a bigger semi truck trailer.<br />
&quot;Here we are, let&#39;s get you examined!&quot; Sandra said, as she opened the door on the side of the trailer.<br />
The inside of the trailer, did look more like what Lucas had imagined. A cold white shining floor, with what looked like a reclining chair straight out of a dentist practice. Only without the fear of having a person root around inside your mouth...<br />
&quot;Ah, I see you did manage to find one!&quot; a female voice called out from behind a cubicle wall.<br />
Standing up from her chair, was an older woman in a lab coat.<br />
&quot;Looks like you were right Marjorie, there is always one!&quot; Sandra laughed. Lucas was still standing there in the back like a fish out of water, not sure what he should do.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the monkey subject?&quot; Marjorie asked Sandra, as she approached Lucas with an inquisitive eye.<br />
Lucas gripped the towel tight, and bounced back a bit, intimidated by the older woman&#39;s presence.<br />
&quot;Yup, this is Lucas, he is the boy that volunteered for a second dosage even!&quot; Sandra said, introducing the boy to the woman.<br />
&quot;Huh....&quot; the woman said, now very close to Lucas&#39; face, &quot;Put him on the bed, let&#39;s see what is what!&quot;.<br />
The woman walked back towards a counter, filled with equipment, as Sandra motion Lucas towards the examination bed.<br />
Lucas took a seat, unsure of his current situation, he looked over at Sandra and asked &quot;What are you going to do, exactly?&quot;.<br />
Sandra wanted to answer him, but she was interrupted by Marjorie, who cleared her throat.<br />
&quot;I am going to take a blood sample, and administer a variant of the drug that will advance your transformation back to a reasonable state&quot;, she said as she shined a little light in the poor boys eyes, as she then grabbed a large syringe.<br />
Lucas eyes went wide, as he pulled the towel closer to him, &quot;Please tell me you don&#39;t need to use that?&quot; he stammered, very afraid of the needle.<br />
Without even saying a word of encouragement or comfort, the woman jammed the syringe into the boys right arm.<br />
Lucas yelped, moreso out of fright then out of pain, as the needle was stuck in his arm.<br />
&quot;There we are, quit your whining&quot; The woman said bluntly, as she ripped the towel away leaving Lucas completely exposed.<br />
After the needle did its work she carefully pulled it out of his arm, and reached for a new syringe filled with a bright yellow liquid.<br />
&quot;You see this, boy? This is the serum we made the pills out of, it introduces a mutagen to your body that is responisble for the mutation, which led you to becoming a monkey like creature&quot; Marjorie said as she showed Lucas the syringe.<br />
Lucas gulped at the sight of another needle, whilst he covered his manhood with his hands.<br />
Before anything else could happen, Sandra finally stepped in.<br />
&quot;Oh come on Marjorie, he is a sweet boy, there is no need to scare him into compliance, as a matter of fact I saw he secretly enjoyed being a monkeyboy!&quot; she said laughing, hoping that the older woman would stop scaring the poor boy.<br />
&quot;Is that so? Tell me boy, what did you enjoy most then?&quot; The woman asked, wanting to test Sandra&#39;s statement for herself.<br />
Lucas didn&#39;t need time to think, &quot;I really liked having a tail, but I fell asleep before I got the chance to really check it out, you know?&quot; he said, his eyes betraying how badly he wanted the tail again.<br />
The woman looked him in the eye for a few moments, before finally gracing her face with a smile, making her look far kinder than she was so far.<br />
&quot;Is that so? What if I told you I can make you look just like you want then?&quot; She said, as she put the syringe down, and looked at Lucas.<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s cool! So I can have the tail back?&quot; Lucas asked with hope in his voice, man he missed that tail!<br />
The woman finally seemed to warm up to the boy, &quot;Yes you can, however, for our research you will have to be a lot more monkey then just the tail! So seeing as you don&#39;t have any clothes on, I am also giving you some fur back, especially around your legs, but before I do that I need to know if you&#39;ve had any problems?&quot; She said and asked, as Lucas tilted his head out of curiousity.<br />
Well the answer was no right? He hadn&#39;t experienced any discomfort or other issues, so he looked up at the woman and shook his head.<br />
&quot;Nothing I can think off right now! Why are others having problems?&quot; he asked and the woman turned around towards a device as she adjusted some settings on it. &quot;Well, you are after all an more of an animal than a normal boy, so for example, some of you have no bladder control, meaning that you would not be able to hold it if you have to pee, others experience a complete change of behaviour and start to act like the monkeys you look like, so for some we need to take extra measures, for example I have given two other boys mandatory diapers to wear&quot;.<br />
Lucas was worried, he wouldn&#39;t have to start wearing diapers, would he?<br />
&quot;But anyway, I can see that your fur is almost completely gone, apart from these sections on your arms, your foot is back to normal apart from the thumb...&quot; She said examining the boy, as she turned him towards his stomach, &quot;And you have what appears to be left over fur just above your rear, where your tail used to be&quot;.<br />
She finished checking Lucas out, and rolled him back to a normal position.<br />
&quot;Now, I can give you your tail back guarenteed, by creating certain enzymes, with this machine you saw me use earlier&quot;, Marjorie said as she pointed to the weird computer.<br />
&quot;So, what will it be?&quot;</p>
