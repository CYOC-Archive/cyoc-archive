<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You weren&#39;t sure what you did yesterday as you felt groggy to get up and out of bed, but you did and walked to the bathroom while nearly dragging your feet on the floor. Unaware that Retsuko, your girlfriend was also sleeping in bed with you through the night from yesterday as she drowsly toss and turned in her sleep to get up after you did a few minutes later. Stepping in the bathroom as you made your way to the sink and turn the faucet on for water that you cupped your hands together and began to splash your face and rub it s to wake up when you started to drink from the pouring water, like a dog would from a hose with the water left out running for to long. Wait, why would you lap up water like a dog for a drink of water?<br />
<br />
Grabbing a white towel from a near by hanger as you dry your face with it that you then placed the towel on the back of your neck, but leaving the two ends over your shoulders while casually holding on to them tightly. Not talking to anyone pacifically as you look into the mirror that you softly spoke out loud to yourself, before leaving the bathroom. &quot;What a weird night. Well, I guess it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as you were about to leave, you quickly rushed back to see your reflection of the mirror again as you thought something was off about yourself. getting a steady look of yourself as you see a grey wolfman with long white hair is when you decided to twiched your ears to if they would move, the wolfman in the mirror did the same for it to twiched it&#39;s ears back and forth. giving one more test to see if this was for real that you opened up your chompas really wide while letting out a growling sound as to saw ahh, yet the beast in the mirror opened up it&#39;s muzzle up pretty wide as you saw a good amount of canine wolf teeth.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure how to explain it, but you were the grey wolfman that was stearing back in the mirror of your reflection. You quickly remembered everything as to what happened last night, even to the point about the wolf costume you desided to ware from the mall you were in. Shocked as you soon remembered about the voice inside your head that if you had to guess what kind of wolf person you are now, you would have to be someone from the tv show pre cure, or the english dub version, glitter force. You were somehow wolfrun, or ulric by just his looks alone, but minus the suit he wares as those were taken off by Retsuko before bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it that outfit from last night at the mall? But how? I mean, this can&#39;t be real.something like this can&#39;t be explained by science in this time of age.&quot; You said to yourself, feeling as if you were in denial to this alien body.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! This an&#39;t possible! This an&#39;t possible! This an&#39;t possible! It&#39;s gatta be that... i see myself as a wolf, but to everyone else that I look normal.&quot; You say to yourself, thinking that this was somehow all a big hallucination. It was then you heard a knock at  the door,  remembering that you closed it while entering the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap! I got to hid somewhere, but where? Wait, did she see me like this last night?&quot; You frantically freaked out as you asked yourself these, and more as the door slowly opened that you calmly settled down your nerve for what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
Once the door was open that Retsuko was in a state of shock to not only see you naked, but also a hairy beast was in the bathroom as you looked over to her. To stun on what to say or do that in your deeper, gruffer wolven voice is when you decided do do something as you broke the silence by asking her a question. &quot;Retsuko, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ah, it&#39;s nothing... it&#39;s just that I remember you telling me about how you were somewhat different than what most people were talking about. Telling me that you were some kind of a reverse werewolf that i didn&#39;t believe in you about it, but i never thought in my wildest fantasies you were a creature which stands before me now. Your so breath taking that your even hotter like this than you were in your normal human form. Please, Can you ever forgive me for ever doubting you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod with a smile across your wolven face. you still wondered though as to what would happen, now that you looked lick a humanoid wolf with a mind that belongs to a normal human. &quot;Of course I forgive you Retsuko. To be honest though, I wouldn&#39;t believe it myself ever. Still, is there anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did tell me that you were alone. being the only one of your kind that is left out there in the world, it&#39;s kinda lonely when you think about it. I was wondering....n,now that I have seen this for myself at first glance and first hands experience, can there be more of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no one really gave me much of a thought to ask me that question before. However, you can help me with that for there is a way to do so. there could be more of my kind that if it did happen, then I won&#39;t be so lonely as to being the only one of my kind anymore. Still though, if you want that it&#39;s only far for you to decide on what choice you want. That said, we can do this tonight and make a start of a new being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s great!&quot; Said Retsuko while jumping with joy as she clapped her hands together that she turned around for a sec to face you again, but quickly turned to face the clock a second later. She didn&#39;t seem to happy about something as her eyes lit up wide, like a rocket blasting off to the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! Be right back. Just give me a sec!&quot; She said as Retsuko ran out of the bathroom, leaving you still standing there in yourfurry naked body. A few minutes later, she returns with the clothes you had on from last night and handed them over to you by reaching out her arm that she was blushing as she looked away while doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, p,put them on! It&#39;s bad enough that I walked in here while you were... well, naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down at yourself that you felt ashamed as you thought of immediately taking your clothes and quickly slip them on while covering up your decency from any one seeing you like this. However, you took it like a man and kindly took it from her hand&#39;s reach. Thanking her that while you were stripping on your underwear that she was getting change to, but in the bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t thank mejust yet. Come on out, once done getting dressed. We&#39;re going to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Late? Late for what? What are you talking about Retsuko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you forgotten already! You of all people, well, you know what I mean. But anyways, you should remember what today is by now? Today is....&quot;<br />
<br />
(What is happening today that got your girlfriend Retsuko all worked up about? Feeling free to add your very own ideas as there are a few listed down below on what&#39;s happening now with them. Thank you, one and all. And don&#39;t forget, happy reading.)</p>
