<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alicia eventually began to grow cold as the sun was beginning to set and a light breeze picked up. She got out of the kiddy pool and wrapped a large beach towel around her body. Jeff looked right into her eyes and leaned forward and kissed her. It was a gentle kiss, but one which Alicia quickly pushed to go farther with than Jeff had anticipated, but he wasn&#39;t complaining as he pulled her body close to his to follow her tongue&#39;s request to go deeper. She however was the one to break it off when she placed a hand on his erection that could be felt even through his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we want to give Cris another sibling just yet,&quot; said Alicia. Jeff knew that the likelihood of getting pregnant with a second baby while pregnant with a first was if not impossible, damn near unlikely, but he wasn&#39;t about to ruin the moment by saying as such.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what am I supposed to do in the meanwhile?&quot; mockingly complained Jeff as she slipped back into her flip flops to re-enter the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think that&#39;d be obvious,&quot; said Alicia with a wink before running back into her mother&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
<i>And highly unlikely to happen with a bunch of first graders under my watch...</i><br />
<br />
Jeff sighed and left the Fuentes back yard. As he came onto the sidewalk, he nearly knocked over Mr. Fisher, who was out walking his golden retriever named Barney,  as he was apt to do at this time of evening. Joseph Fisher was the neighbor catty-corner to the Davis family, and directly across the street from the Fuentes family. He had moved in to the house a year or so ago and lived by himself, except for every other weekend when his ex-wife was seen dropping off his decidedly teenage kids who typically lived with their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going!&quot; chided Mr. Fisher with a sour look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t see you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your mind was clearly elsewhere... I do hope you plan on marrying that girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jeff, taken aback by what sounded like a suggestion from the 1950s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider you&#39;ve knocked her up and you just pressured her to keep the little bastard, the least you can do is make an honest woman out of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had never had much of an opinion about Mr. Fisher, but what little existed suddenly dropped through the floorboards of good opinion and into the cellar of firm dislike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you mind your own business,&quot; returned Jeff, knowing he didn&#39;t need to put up with any crap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look kid, if you really want that baby as much as you said? You&#39;d be wise to marry her so you don&#39;t have to put up with the headache that&#39;s shared custody. But what do I know? I mean I&#39;ve only had the experience of being married and not--what could I possibly have to share about my experience?&quot; And with a loud huff, Mr. Fisher started to continue down the street. Feeling a bit angry, and not wanting the pompous middle-aged man to have the last word, Jeff fished out his phone and pulled out the Chronivac. Perhaps it was time that Tommy got another classmate and friend?<br />

Jeff decided to tweak this one specifically rather than leave certain options on &quot;Auto&quot; like he had previously.<br />
<br />

Without a second thought, Jeff pressed the &quot;Transform&quot; button and watched as Joseph Fisher froze right in front of Jeff&#39;s house. The middle-aged man was overweight, as his pushed out shirt and stocky build communicated for him. He was dressed in casual exercise clothes--a t-shirt with the local football team on it, gym shorts, sneakers, and white socks. A day&#39;s growth was on his face as though he hadn&#39;t cared to shave or take care of himself. His hair was clipped short, with noticeable thinning on top that a close cut could hardly disguise.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Jeff noticed was Mr. Fisher&#39;s hard stomach began to shrink, and shrink rapidly. It was almost comical how much his shirt deflated over the course of his forties. Jeff guessed that the divorce had likely led to him eating poorly and drinking which had led him to put on the weight. His hair also began to grow back in with the top becoming thicker and longer, while the sides of his hair remained close clipped. His day&#39;s old growth was shaved down leaving him with a five o&#39;clock shadow. Soon, a thirty-something stocky man of more average weight was standing in front of Jeff. While he wasn&#39;t the most handsome man that Jeff had ever seen, he had a certain rugged charm and air about his presence which was likely appealing to women, Jeff guessed.<br />
<br />
As Joseph continued to grow younger, his stocky muscles began to shrink little by little, making him look less stacked, and far more athletically muscled. The light brown hair at the top of his head continued to grow longer, now long enough to have his middle part brush the tops of his ears. As he hit the prime of his life about age 30, Joseph looked like a well muscled gym rat. So far all that had changed was his clothes had readjusted for size, with only now his t-shirt transforming into a tight fitting wifebeater style shirt which showed off his broad shoulders, his biceps, and gave a peak to his pecs and thick chest hair.<br />
<br />
He however did not stop there as Jeff was going to bring Tommy yet another classmate, and so Joseph or &quot;Joe&quot; as Jeff was thinking of him as, continued to grow younger into his twenties, his muscles continuing to shrink through the decade where he went from looking &quot;athletically muscled&quot; to &quot;athletically lean&quot; looking by the time he would&#39;ve been re-entering College--which he was as his wifebeater shirt changed to name the name of a University that Jeff had never heard of before. His five o&#39;clock shadow at this point began to disappear, as did the chest hair which spilled over the edge of his wifebeater, his chest looking more like a teen&#39;s as he lost more and more of his college education with each moment that went by. Pretty soon, the athletic college senior had become a lean college freshman, who was more an older teen on the cusp of manhood than a man himself by his smooth baby face features and lack of chest hair communicated. At that point the wifebeater regained its t-shirt shape and gained a high school cross country team logo on it.<br />
<br />
Soon though the leanness became thin, and then almost unbelievably skinny to the point where calling Joe &quot;skin and bones&quot; would probably be more appropriate. It was about this point that the shrink spurts hit as he went backwards through high school as puberty undid itself even more than it already had. Hair on his arms and legs turned to peach fuzz before vanishing entirely. His baby face became even rounder and more innocent looking, and his shrinking spurts left him with hands and feet far too large for his small body, before they too shrank to be more proportional as he was pulled completely onto the other side of puberty and into being a preteen entirely--a short and skinny preteen boy.<br />
<br />
But childhood&#39;s beck and call continued to work its magic on Joe, or &quot;Joey&quot; as Jeff&#39;s altering memories informed him. Joey&#39;s clothes shifted to have a Pokemon t-shirt logo, while still keeping his athletic shorts, sneakers, and socks--though his socks had turned black as he&#39;d gotten younger, and his sneakers had shrunk with his feet and continued to do so as Joey left preteen adolescence for preadolescence. He remained skinny as he got shorter, and his grin began to lose his adult teeth in favor of being replaced with baby teeth, except for a few teeth near the front of his mouth as he ended his final shrink spurt at age six, freckles appearing across his face, and his long top of his head hair reshaping itself into a faux hawk that was popular with certain elementary school age kids. Joey&#39;s sneakers weren&#39;t light up like Ryan and Tommy&#39;s were, instead being black low top all star knockoffs. Joey&#39;s Pokemon shirt design settled at age six with a Pikachu design, with the words &quot;Gotta Catch &#39;Em All&quot; underneath. Joey blinked a few times before a tug to keep moving was felt at the other end of his leash by Barney--the golden retriever who had watched the transformation and whimpered throughout--though thankfully hadn&#39;t turned to barking. Barney&#39;s pull on the leash that Joey held practically caused Joey to fall over, causing him to scrape his hands and knees, sending the boy into a crying spell that he was typically known for Jeff&#39;s mind was telling him. Joey was a scaredy cat as Ryan was apt to say whenever Joey wasn&#39;t around--and was quick to say that maybe they shouldn&#39;t do something if it might get them in trouble Tommy and Ryan were friendly with Joey because he was in their Cub Scout Den like all the rest of their friends (except for Harry of course), but sometimes Ryan would convince Tommy to ditch Joey with Jane so they could go exploring. Jane, for her part was a little more sympathetic to Joey than Ryan and Tommy could be, but even she had her moments where she wasn&#39;t in the mood to mother hen Joey and his almost neurotic fears his parents instilled in him. That&#39;s one of the reasons why Barney went almost everywhere with Joey--for some reason Joey had it in his head that Barney would protect him because he was a &quot;good doggie&quot;. Barney as he currently was, was an aging and tired old golden retriever who&#39;d seen better days, and likely wouldn&#39;t live for more than a few more years--which would mean Joey would have to learn to live without his protector.<br />
<br />
Jeff examined Joey&#39;s brush burns, for that&#39;s all they were, promised that they&#39;d clean them when they went inside, and then took the leash with Barney and directed both boy and dog inside. Once inside the kitchen, Jeff washed the brush burns and then encourage Joey to go and finish watching the movie<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about Barney?&quot; asked Joey with panicky eyes that looked between the dog and the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Barney needs some water after that walk, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey looked at Barney and saw the dog panting hard, and then turned to Jeff and nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll look after Barney quick and you can go in and finish watching the movie now that he&#39;s had a chance to go poop,&quot; said Jeff, purposely saying poop to bring a little smile and a laugh out of Joey--if the kid learned to relax a little and not be neurotic about practically everything, Ryan, Jane, and Tommy likely wouldn&#39;t find him so irritating to be around him. Joey then without another word ran towards the living room, then as if he forgot something he ran back and hugged Barney before returning to entering the living room to finish watching &quot;The Great Race&quot; with Tommy and his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Barney, let&#39;s get you some water and then see what we can do to keep you from pulling Joey to the ground again,&quot; said Jeff as he scratched behind the retriever&#39;s ears and then reached to pull down a bowl to fill with water. Once the water was place on the ground, Barney went to town drinking the water, and Jeff knew that then was his chance. He pulled out his phone once again and scanned Barney.<br />
<br />
Name: Barney<br />
Species: Canine<br />
Breed: Golden Retriever<br />
Age: 9<br />
Mental Age: 9<br />
Height: 23.5&quot;<br />
Weight: 82 lbs<br />
Build: Overweight<br />
Gender: Male<br />
--Neutered<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly switched to his search bar to research just how long Golden Retrievers lived, and when he saw &quot;10 - 12 years&quot; Jeff knew that Joey was definitely far closer to losing Barney than keeping him for much longer--and god knew how Joey would react to losing Barney. No, he&#39;d have to change that now so that Joey would at least have Barney until he&#39;d outgrown this irrational fear stage of his life.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided that perhaps what Joey needed in his life was a puppy--an animal to train and learn to be responsible for. And without giving it another moment&#39;s thought, Jeff turned Barney the 9 year old dog to Barney the 8 month old puppy who shrank and lost weight and became cuter the smaller he became. Soon instead of a slower older dog drinking from the bowl, Jeff had a tiny young puppy who quickly had his full of water and then began chewing on the side of the bowl. Jeff took that as permission to separate Barney from the bowl and then pick him up and bring him into the living room. He put Barney down at the entrance to the living room, which drew the attention of nearly every first grader in the living room away from the musical number occurring on screen in a stereotypical western saloon. Thankfully the words &quot;He Shouldn&#39;ta Hadn&#39;ta Oughta Swang on Me&quot; went completely over their heads. Joey, who had nervously stretched his t-shirt over his legs as he sat on the floor, lit up the moment he saw Barney.<br />
<br />
&quot;Barney... come here boy...&quot; called Joey, patting the floor right next to him. Barney obediently padded his way to Joey and then looked confused as Joey tried to tell him to sit, eventually laying down out of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Joey, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll learn someday,&quot; said Jeff as he took a seat on the couch between Tommy on one side, and Ryan on the other. The moment Jeff had settled himself on the couch, and put his feet up on the Ottoman his mother kept in the Living Room, Tommy positioned himself close to Jeff, and not to be outdone by Tommy, Ryan quickly followed suit on Jeff&#39;s other side, leaving him with a little boy on either side of him, intently watching the movie, but also curled up next to him.</p>
