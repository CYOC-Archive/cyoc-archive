<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We finished our drinks and things began to settle down again.  I decided that I needed to clean some things in the kitchen.  Scott decided to stay back and help me while the others returned to the living room.  I was glad for this as it gave me a few minutes to talk to him about a few things.  “So…” I said.  “I gotta say I’m surprised by this.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” he said.  “I’m surprised myself.  But I know it’s the right thing for me to do.  For us to do.”<br />
<br />
“If you’re sure you’ll both be happy, that’s all that matters,” I said.<br />
<br />
“She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever known before,” said Scott.  “She’s free-spirited and confident.  She knows how to handle herself.  She doesn’t get embarrassed and she doesn’t let you feel embarrassed around her either.  She’s just terrific.”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” I said.  “I’ve definitely never heard you like this before.”<br />
<br />
Scott laughed.  “Of course you haven’t, my voice is different,” he said.  Before I could react to his joke, he added, “I know what you meant.”<br />
<br />
We continued to clean a few dishes and glasses.  I then brought up the subject about which I most wanted to talk to him.  “What about the sex situation?” I asked.  “I mean, is there something more you’re not mentioning?”<br />
<br />
“Really?” he asked.  “Are you really afraid I’m being mistreated or something?”<br />
<br />
“No, not that at all,” I replied.  “I guess I’m just curious as to who’s in charge.”<br />
<br />
“Why is that so important?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m wondering if this big male to female change is causing males to become…like, submissive, I guess,” I answered.  “You know, like are females who were always female going to be more dominant than females who were males?”<br />
<br />
Scott seemed confused.  “How would you tell that?” he asked.  “Everyone’s going to be female.”<br />
<br />
“Instinctively, I mean,” I said.  “Men were always dominant because of physical differences.  Those differences are going to be gone.  So are the women who were men, like us, all going to defer to women who always were women?”<br />
<br />
“No offense, bro,” said Scott as he placed his hand on my shoulder.  “But I think you’re freaking out and over-thinking this.”  Then he scrunched his face and stared at his hand.  “Huh, look at that,” he said as he removed his hand.<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m getting long nails now,” he said.  He held up his hand so that I could see his fingernails were longer.<br />
<br />
I held up my hand and said to him, “Beat you to it.”<br />
<br />
“Huh,” he said.  “But your whole bedroom question.  Why are you so worried?  Something wrong between you and Rachel?”<br />
<br />
“No, there’s nothing wrong at all,” I said.  This was the truth.  Nothing was “wrong” between Rachel and I.  “I guess I was just wanted a comparison to another couple.”<br />
<br />
“Something you wanna tell me?” he asked.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, I thought about telling him exactly what Rachel and I had been up to sexually.  But that would betray Rachel’s trust.  If we were going to tell others about that, it was a decision we’d have to make together.  “No,” I said.  “I think you’re right.  I’m just over-thinking stuff.”<br />
<br />
A few minutes later we finished cleaning the dishes and returned to the living room.  Before I sat down I got that uncomfortable feeling again.  Since I was only wearing an undershirt and a pair of socks, it was easy to pinpoint the cause.  It was the shirt.  “Oh, well,” I thought to myself.  I knew where this was headed anyway.  I took off the shirt and threw it onto the pile of clothes.  Then I sat down in the chair by myself.  <br />
<br />
Carl took notice and said, “How are those socks still on your feet?  How do they still even fit?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s test something,” Carl said as he stood up.  As soon as he was standing straight, his boxers simply fell to the floor.  He had grown so much thinner that even the elastic boxers were simply too big now.  “I thought that was going to happen.”  He picked them up and threw them on the pile.  His shirt looked big on him and it actually hung down below his waist.  He lifted it up to look at his groin.  He still had a miniscule penis, just like me.  But I noticed on him, and then on myself, that in addition to our penises being incredibly small, they didn’t really look that much like penises anymore.  “I guess it’s turning into a clit now,” Carl said.  He looked at me and said, “Yours, too.”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” I said as I looked down.  When I looked down at my penis again, I noticed something else.  My nipples had been growing larger and my chest had seemed puffier.  Now as I looked at my chest I could see that two tiny bumps had formed under my nipples.  I was finally starting to grow breasts!  I shook my chest a little to see if anything would feel differently.  I felt a little sensation but that was it.  Even so I blurted out, “My breasts are starting to grow!”<br />
<br />
As soon as I said that, Scott took off his shirt and tossed it toward the pile.  Everyone looked at him and waited for him to say the inevitable.  “Look, I’m getting mine, too!”<br />
<br />
Then we all looked at Carl expectantly.  He put his hands on his chest and said.  “Yea, me too.  But I’m not ready to show them off.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m ready to show mine off,” said Rachel.  She quickly unclasped her bra and slid it off her shoulders.  The bra went onto the pile and she joined Pam in proudly displaying her fully developed tits.  Pam responded by taking off her socks.  Joyce did something a bit different.  She unbuttoned her shirt and let it hang open.  Then she took off her bra, without removing her shirt, and threw it on the pile, too.  She did not, however, button her shirt again.  She just let it hang free.<br />
<br />
“So we’re all down to one piece of clothing,” I remarked.  “What fun.”<br />
<br />
“Wait!” said Rachel.  “Look at the TV!”</p>
