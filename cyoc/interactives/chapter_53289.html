<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a full day of classes and than football practice, Jerome was dead tired and it did not <br />
help how he had been feeling off all day. Since the time Jerome got to school he had been <br />
feeling that he has not been acting like himself, first with how he was rock hard the entire <br />
day, usually Jerome would throw a boner here or there but today it felt like his cock was <br />
getting stimulated more than usual, Jerome had to pop out of class a few times to release <br />
one in the bathroom so he could at least try to get it down, though if anything Jerome felt <br />
it made it worse cause he would get to class, been even hornier and end up rubbing one <br />
out into his jockstrap. As the day went on during his free period when he would usually <br />
work out, he did, but shirtless and in the small cut shorts he asked the gym teacher he <br />
could borrow, shirtless was a norm, but the pants, and the fact he was hard the entire <br />
time he was wearing them, he was definitely getting stares. Though none of this was as <br />
bad as football practice when he tackled a guy and he ended up behind him with his bulge <br />
against the guys ass, Jerome secretly did like screwing around with guy, but this was out <br />
in the open and he humped him once or twice before getting up. The guys proble took it <br />
as a joke, yet he noticed when he got up he had left a wet cum spot against the guys pants <br />
right between his cheeks and Jerome knew that the guy Rico who he had pretty much <br />
humped was gonna give him shit, yet all he saw was the guy turn around and smile at him <br />
which kinda threw him off. The day pretty much was over and instead of staying and <br />
showering after practice, Jerome just wanted to go home, but before he could leave Rico <br />
had come up to him and had written down if he was ever wanted to &quot;practice&quot; again to call <br />
him, this kinda freaked Jerome out since it was a guy at his school but still at the same <br />
time made his cock get harder that it had been. <br />
Jerome's day was finally over and he drove to his empty house, he stripped down to his <br />
jockstrap, which for some reason he decided to keep on though it was kinda cum covered, <br />
and lay down to pass out.Jerome knocked out within the next few min and that is when <br />
Ryan knew it was time to move up. Ryan focused on the unconscious black stud and felt <br />
himself travel from the jockstrap to Jerome's mind. Ryan felt his entire body sore, his cock <br />
wet and this didn't bother him at all cause he had a body! Ryan arose in Jerome's perfectly <br />
sculpted body and turned around to look at the mirror. He saw this black stud muscular as <br />
hell with a full pouch in the mirror flexing and smiling like he had just won the lottery, and <br />
Ryan knew if he never got his own body back he would be okay with that if he could stay <br />
as Jerome, yet Ryan knew he had to ensure he would retain control of this body. It is than <br />
than Ryan started to rub on his jockstrap, he could feel the wetness from when he had <br />
Jerome stroking himself earlier and this time Ryan decided Jerome wasn't only going to <br />
blow a load this time, he was gonna blow out the very essence of Jerome out of his body <br />
so that Ryan could stay in this body forever. Ryan started to jerk his cock in the jockstrap <br />
and while he was he was getting images of what Jerome was thinking and his fantasies, <br />
one of which was banging Rico from earlier and even another of him screwing Ryan <br />
himself, well the site was appealing, if anyone was banging that body later, it would be <br />
him if VInce ever changed the jock back and at this point he didn't care, he started <br />
building up a load in that jock like none of the previous loads Jerome had blown earlier, <br />
and when he was at his peak he felt his body gush out every drops of cum he swore was in <br />
these huge nuts of his, he could feel Jerome disappearing and being blown into the <br />
jockstrap. Ryan finally came back from his climax and he could sense that Jerome was in <br />
the jockstrap, and that was the sign that he should take it off, he did and decided it was <br />
time to get back to knocking out for the night, though in the back of his head he did <br />
remember he had Rico's number. He decided to just throw the jock into the laundry <br />
though when he threw it he may have missed and threw it on the clean stuff but whatever, <br />
he was ready to pass out in his new muscular hung body.</p>
