<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Larry stood there in the glass enclosure, letting the hot water fall onto his body that was a bit bigger than he was before, before he was mountainous... now he was feeling more like he would be monstrous as all of the muscles on him were thick and beefy... brawny and massive, feeling really good and finally starting to relax. The pitter-patter of the water dripping from the showerhead onto his body and then onto the floor, while draining into the drain was soothing, relaxing and almost hypnotic in a way as he closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. Slowly letting it out, his eyes fluttered open as he looked at his surroundings. Larry was honestly surprised at how nice the place was for a simple motel, but he just shrugged and let that get rinsed away too, imagining that it was a new thing for them to do since the other bigger hotels were even nicer than this for more money... as was to be expected. Slowly, Larry rubbed his body, feeling a little achy from everything that had happened, wanting to relax and get ready for whatever the night would bring. His mind going to the thoughts of the hallway and the smells in there that had wafted into his nose. Larry closed his eyes and smiled on the scents and the one that lingered in his mind more than any of the others was the scent of cologne with a slight earthen smell to it.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait...&#39; Larry thought to himself, &#39;why am I thinking about cologne some other dude wore? Dudes wear cologne, women wear perfume and though there isn&#39;t anything wrong with liking men... I don&#39;t.&#39; He added, reassuring himself of his true nature.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes, he slowly started to rub his hands all over his own body, feeling the thicker hair that had developed running between his fingers. Larry felt the big, strong muscles that had developed under his skin as his cock rose and grew harder. Bringing his hands up over his arms and biceps, Larry couldn&#39;t help imagine feeling the big, thick muscles of another person instead of the lithe muscles Clarice had as a woman. Even the thought of touching her, for some reason, wasn&#39;t appealing and actually made him lose his arousal for a moment. He shook getting the thoughts out as he focused on what he was doing... what he was touching and his erection slowly returned. Up over the decently sized shoulders where the bite was and then down over his meaty, hairy pecs as his thumbs brushed over his nipples and nearly sent him over the edge. Larry&#39;s mind locking onto the thought of his hands touching and rubbing a beefy, burly, hairy and rugged man... not leaving him be. Larry opened his eyes and smiled wryly. Both upper and lower bicuspids were sharper now while his ears were tipped and slightly pointed. His face nicely shadowed with thick, dark brown stubble as his eyes shone amber for a moment and then went back to his normal color.<br />
<br />
Larry grinned as he thought about finding himself a man... a real man... to explore these new feelings with and to enjoy what it was like to be accepting of others for who he also had tried so hard not to be. Before the bite, Larry couldn&#39;t stand being hairy or with a man... but now that was all different. That was all that Larry could think about and his cock twitched in response, which meant only one thing... Larry wanted to go on the hunt for another man. Decided, since he couldn&#39;t think of anything else and he wanted to get rid of this aching and throbbing problem of his, Larry turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, grabbing a nearby towel and dried off quickly. Toweling off as best as he could, Larry knew he would either have to put on the same clothes or go out there to face Clarice to get different ones and figured since all he did was rinse off, his old clothes would be fine. Quickly and with a decided vigor, Larry put on his clothes and made himself look presentable in the mirror. His eyes had locked onto the new changes, but at the same time... he didn&#39;t think they were odd or off-putting. Rather... he thought they made him look even more manly and grinned. As he opened the door, Clarice... who had been setting things up on the bed for her idea of a good time, looked up and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... decided to get dressed again just for me to have to take them off... like opening a present on my birthday or Christmas morning?&quot; She said walking over to him and running a finger down the cleft of his slightly larger pecs.<br />
<br />
Feeling uncomfortable and his legs urging him to sprint away, Larry just shook his head. &quot;No... I... I just need some time. I need a walk or something to clear my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of dismay became plastered all over her face. &quot;But... isn&#39;t that what got you in this situation in the first place?&quot; She said as worry could be heard soaking her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it is, but don&#39;t worry. I am just going to walk around the hotel. I will be fine inside. There aren&#39;t any big, scary monsters in the hotel and I am going to be just safe here.&quot; He said while thinking how much he would rather find a monster of a man, like him, there on the prowl for the same thing he wanted.<br />
<br />
Clarice&#39;s look softened as she smiled. &quot;O... ok then Larry. Don&#39;t keep me waiting for you stud.&quot; She said with a playful and sexy smile that actually made Larry&#39;s stomach churn a bit.<br />
<br />
With a half hearted smile, Larry nodded, &quot;Ok babe. You don&#39;t have to wait up for me either. I have a feeling I might be gone a while. You know how I was cooped up in that hospital bed? I... I just need some time to unwind and I am pretty wound up now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I noticed and that&#39;s what I hoped to help with.&quot; She said sexily again, her index finger on her lips, playfully toying with it and it made Larry want to vomit. He didn&#39;t understand it, but suddenly it was as if this wolf monster bite had awoken something different in him... something that had always been there, but wasn&#39;t at the forefront of his thoughts. A deep-seeded desire of sorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Clarice... it&#39;s just not something that you can help me out with now.&quot; Larry said as he opened the door to their room, stepped out backwards into the hallway and closed the door for him to be free of her.<br />
<br />
As Larry walked away from the room, he rubbed his meaty and hairier hands together, not noticing how his fingernails had started to lengthen already, slowly becoming claws as the skin on his palms started to not only darken, but thicken into the beginning of pads. &quot;Now... for me to find me a real man to see if these feelings that have arisen are the REAL me!&quot; He said with a wry grin full of lust as he licked his chops as the idea of finding one... if not several men... was incredibly delicious.</p>
