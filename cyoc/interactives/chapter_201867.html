<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lindsay couldn’t believe her eyes, they where now on an island surrounded by nothing but ocean with some distant small tropical islands in the distance.<br />
<br />
“LINDSAY!” yelled her boyfriend from down by the beach. Without saying a word, Lindsay turned and ran down the sand dune almost tripping over her own feet and face planting in the sand, but she remained on her feet. She ran toward the beach where everyone was gathering.<br />
<br />
“Guys you will not believe this!” yelled Lindsay but no one was looking at her, instead they were looking out toward the water. Lindsay looked toward the water, to see a small pillar of water rising from the ocean about 5 or so feet above the crashing wave. The pillar took on the appearances of a high-backed chair with arm rests. Sitting on top of the water chair was an actual mermaid. “My God…is this real?”<br />
<br />
“It is real.” Answered the mermaid, the mermaid was in her early to mid-40s and looked extremely good, an average size body, with a nice-looking face with her long blonde hair was pulled back into a tight bun, her massive breasts where contained within a bra made out of sea shells, sea weed and other items. Coming from her hips was a long scaled covered tail, the scales where a sort of pinkish coral color.  “Is this everyone?”<br />
<br />
“My camera isn’t working.” complained someone nearby <br />
<br />
“Your cameras will not work, nothing that works on electricity will work here.” Answered the mermaid, she sounded like a principle or tour guild. “I ask again is this everyone?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Answered a male voice<br />
<br />
“Alright, my name is Tamela and I am your transition counselor.” stated the mermaid <br />
<br />
“What?” asked a women’s voice in the group<br />
<br />
“Since this is a large group can we save questions until the end?” advised Tamela, but of course no one listened to her as people began to shoat questions at her. <br />
<br />
“Are we sure we aren’t having a bad trip?” asked one of Lindsay friends.<br />
<br />
“Believe me after dealing with a lot of young adults I need a good hit of stuff after this.” Stated Tamela sounding like a tired overworked office worker. <br />
<br />
“Shut up!” yelled Lindsay as everyone looked at her. “We can’t get any answers if we just keep asking her questions which she isn’t going to answer, she seams to be working off a script?”<br />
<br />
“Basically.” confirmed Tamela <br />
<br />
“So our only hope to find answers is to wait until either she explains it or the end like she requested.” Stated Lindsay, everyone grandly their agreement and looked toward the mermaid.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Tamela “Alright, yes I am a real mermaid born in the sea and all. Secondly you aren’t on earth anymore.”<br />
<br />
“What?” asked multiple people as Tamela let out a sigh as others forced people to be quiet. “The beach you where on is basically a doorway between the human world and a parallel world full of magical sea-based creatures. It is a one-way door, akin to a Venus fly trap plant, only instead of insects it traps and transports people to this world.”<br />
<br />
“How do we get back?” asked a voice<br />
<br />
“You don’t.” answered Tamela as there was a torrent of people yelling and threatening her.<br />
<br />
“Listen, there is nothing I can do? I nor any other mermaid or merman have control over this thing? It is a force of nature all we can do is manage it.” stated Tamela “Besides it is too late for all of you, you have all been in the water and you are on an island now…”<br />
<br />
“Like hell! We aren’t on a stupid island” yelled one of the boys whom Lindsay wasn’t close to, Mike. He was a muscle jerk in Lindsay’s view, but he was also the life of the party and he was a friend of a friend. He took off running down the beach, splashing in the water as he did. He turned a corner and after a couple of minutes he came around the other side. It was kind of funny to see the stun expression on his face when he ran around the entire island. “What the fuck.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you just speed up your time frame.” said Tamela as she pointed to Mike’s foot, his entire right foot up to his ankle was now covered with pitch black scales with a couple purples mixed in. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” yelled Mike dropping into the sand looking at his now scaled covered foot.<br />
<br />
“The water around this place both in the human world and most of all here is extremely magical.” Explained Tamela “It will transform you into one of many types of mermaids or merman, the more time you spend or have spent in the water the quicker you will transform.”<br />
<br />
“We…we are transforming into mermaids?” asked Lindsay <br />
<br />
“Or merman.” Added Tamela “The magic can do both gender and age change, mostly age regression but most of the time that is only for older people but there is always a chance.”<br />
<br />
“What the actual fuck?” inquired Lindsay boyfriend<br />
<br />
“Sorry, we have no control over this, it is a force of nature like a whirlpool or a tornado for you. You where all in the wrong place at the wrong time. In a couple of months, the portal will open again somewhere else in the world.” Stated Tamela “We are only trying our best to manage it and help you transition to a new life.”<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said multiple people<br />
<br />
“Now, most of you will not have radical changes but all of you will have some.” Explained Tamela “All of you will grow a tail, while one like mine is the most common it isn’t the only kind.”<br />
<br />
With that, Tamela raised her hand as basically a magical hologram showed multiple types of tails, some where very much like Tamela’s only with small fins, or two larger fins or a back fin. Some where like octopuses, eels, squids, whales, sharks, dolphins, lionfish and other types. <br />
<br />
“All of you will experience some physical changes beside the tail, for mermaids it will be things like a larger bust. Don’t worry not all mermaids have as big of a bust as I do? I am considered busty even by mermaid standards. For men, bigger members but they will be internal and only come out during sex.” Explained Tamela as Lindsay remembered her top feeling tighter in the bathroom. “Everyone will be more physical fit, but don’t expect to drop a 100 pounds or so unless your going through a gender change. We do have merman and mermaids who are built like Maori warriors.”<br />
<br />
“Some of you may go through lesser changes, hair color, eye color may change.” Said Tamela as the image of a mermaid with lime green hair and a merman with dark purple hair appeared. “Don’t worry if that happens.”<br />
<br />
“As for merpeople culture we are very welcoming and open culture, everyone is treated equally and all forms of love between consenting adults are allowed. Gay, lesbian, Poly are just as welcomed as straight couples and…” stated Tamela<br />
<br />
“Listen this is a lot to deal with can we have a moment?” inquired Lindsay<br />
<br />
“Of course we will actually cover most of this in greater detail once you transform. I will be just offshore, yell if you have any questions but I will add that if you spent any time in the water here you are already transforming.” Stated Tamela “The rate depends on how long you where in the water, most of you likely have a few hours until the transformation is done. Shorter depending on how long you where in and if you just want to get it over and done with just walk into the water and it will happen much quicker.”<br />
<br />
“How long?” inquired Mike as he looked at the scaled covered foot, already the scales had climbed above his ankle and scales where visible on the other foot.<br />
<br />
“Since you ran through the water, maybe 30 minutes for you.” Explained Tamela as the chair lowered and she sank below the waves leaving everyone stunned at what do next.</p>
