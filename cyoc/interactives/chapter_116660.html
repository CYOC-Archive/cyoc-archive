<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh thank god!&quot; The voice from before cried out and a teenager, probably around his own age came running towards Jack.<br />
<br />
The boy was scrawny, but he had height on his side. The teen looked like he had seen better days, but seeing the open doorway behind Jack brought a smile onto the kid&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been in here for almost 3 days, and the last of the food was used up last night.&quot; The boy was so happy that he wrapped his scrawny arms around Jack and hugged.<br />
<br />
To which Jack just awkwardly patted the boy on the back. &quot;Everything is alight now. How many others are with you?&quot; He looked over the teen, but the darkness prevented him from seeing more than three feet into the room.<br />
<br />
The boy pulled back from the hug and looked sad. &quot;When we were first shoved in here, there had been seven of us. Me, my brother, a pair of police officers, and three older folks who all knew each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious, if there were so many of them, why had only this one boy responded to his call? &quot;Hey kid what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy looked briefly startled before answering. &quot;Me? Well my names Jon and my brother is Lee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are the others Jon?&quot; Was the very next question out of Jack&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
The boy looked sad, but turned and motioned for Jack to follow him. The pair went inside. The room was dark, but the further in they went, the lighter it got. Eventually they came across a small pile of baggage and a table. Jon looked towards his left, and Jack&#39;s eyes followed him.<br />
<br />
A metal cage was set up against a wall. Large enough to hold several bears, but bears were not what was kept inside. It was people, specifically, it was the former survivors. They were quiet, but Jack could clearly see the obvious features that labeled them as Satyrs. Horns grew from their foreheads, hoofs replaced feet, and fur grew in abundance. <br />
<br />
&quot;When the Satyrs overran the checkpoint we were locked in here for our own safety, and at first we thought we were the lucky ones.&quot; Jon sat down close to the cage, a semi-muscular satyr moved closer to the edge. He was brown furred and had a semi-erect cock growing from his sheath. Jon looked at the Satyr and smiled faintly before turning away. &quot;We could hear them attacking the others outside, and then we heard them join in and spread the virus. Before long it grew quiet and we thought it was all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack listened with rapt attention, not aware that a pair of the older Satyrs moved closer when they saw Jack beside Jon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The policemen fell to it first, they displayed the initial signs of infection and had the decency to lock themselves in the quarantine cage. However, they had inadvertently infected everyone else but me. I had been sick with a fever, and locked myself in the bathroom, afraid that I was infected.&quot; Jon&#39;s gaze lingered on the muscular Satyr, who smiled and rubbed his cock enticingly, before he turned back to face Jack. &quot;When I recovered from my fever hysteria, they had locked themselves into the cage and were succumbing to the infection. I watched helpless as they turned from humans into monsters, and then watched as they tried to lure more close to them.&quot; Jon shuttered. &quot;I fed and watered them from a distance, but once food started to run low I was afraid that I would have to let them out in order to escape. I was afraid that I would have to join them if I wanted to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack gave the boy a comforting smile. &quot;It&#39;s alright now Jon, I understand what its like to see your loved ones change. My best friend Tommy roams the streets as a Satyr now. I felt like the world was crashing down around me when I saw him as a Satyr.&quot; Jack admitted the truth, that he was having just a hard time coming to accept the facts of their mutual situation.<br />
<br />
Jack continued talking. &quot;I&#39;m looking for my parents, I think they would have been evacuated here, but I can&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that the older Satyr couple moved into his line of sight, and Jack&#39;s stomach sank. Jon saw the changed in Jack immediately and turned to see what the other teen saw. His line of sight showed the married couple who were the last to succumb to the virus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... Dad...&quot; Jack trailed off. He was too late. Again.<br />
<br />
His dad was just as he remembered, tall and muscled. His cock was dangling between a giant pair of balls, and fur covered his body in the same places as all the other Satyrs. His mother didn&#39;t fare much better, her vagina was closer to her ass now and she was more curvy than before.<br />
<br />
Jon moved over and sat by Jack. &quot;Hey it will be okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack wanted to laugh at the fact that a boy much smaller than him muscle wise, but probably taller than him by a good few inches was comforting him. However, the situation damped his mood, so instead he simply nodded and then asked the next important question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what now? You should leave with me, now that I know my family is a lost cause...&quot; Jack&#39;s eyes trailed towards his silent Satyr parents. &quot;... I think I&#39;m gonna go ahead and move towards the nearest safe zone, which I think might be town hall last I heard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon looked conflicted. &quot;I want to, but what about-&quot; He nodded his head towards the cage filled with Satyrs.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t just leave them, but how to we let them out without giving them the chance to catch up to us?&quot; Jack said aloud.<br />
<br />
He had a few ideas, but they all had some level of risk to them. With Jon&#39;s help, he could make a lift that required the Satyrs to push against the cage in order to level it off the ground; it would take them a long time, but he didn&#39;t know the strength of a Satyr. There also was the option of leaving the rusty pocket knife, he was sure they could think of a way to use it. The easiest, but also the most dangerous, was to leave the key dangling out of immediate reach.<br />
<br />
Jack choose to...</p>
