<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Glitter was sleeping in her bed peacefully when she heard what she thought sounded like a moaning the next morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;....mmaaa!&quot; Glitter was confused as to what the sound was for a minute before she sat up and rubbed her eyes then remembered the day before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; The voice said again as Glitter realized it to be the voice of the young Sarah growing up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby!&quot; Glitter quickly put on her dressing gown and rushed over to the crib she had formed the previous night to see the now one year-old Sarah and Aoloa standing up in it.<br />
<br />
Glitter picked up the two girls and set them on the floor. &quot;Big girl!&quot; Sarah said pounded on the ground. &quot;Remember sweetie, this was your spell, you&#39;ll be back to normal in no time.&quot; Glitter reminded her young daughter.<br />
<br />
Glitter watched as Aoloa struggled to stand up before taking a few brisk walks. Glitter then looked over as Sarah seemed to be having trouble standing up as she kept falling down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my poor girl, you must&#39;ve taken a while to do so much in your life.&quot; Glitter then got down on her knees a few feet away from Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, come here, can you come to mama?&quot; Glitter asked her young daughter with a smile. Sarah stood up as carefully as she could and then took her first step and then another before she walked a few more feet over into Glitter&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, I got to see you take your first steps again!&quot; Glitter said happily as she and Sarah hugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama, I tol&#39; you, Imma big gurl.&quot; Sarah said as Glitter saw her daughter was now 2 years old, as was Aoloa. Glitter then had an idea as she ran over to her dresser and got out an old polaroid camera. She took a quick picture of Sarah who rubbed her eyes from the flash.<br />
<br />
&quot;That hur&#39;...&quot; Sarah moaned rubbing her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry sweetie, but I thought since I&#39;m going to see you grow all over again, I could take some pictures of you and Aoloa as you grow up. They could go along nicely with the one of me holding you as a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds nice.&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Hey, Sarah, wanna finger paint?&quot; Aoloa asked as she looked shyly at Sarah as she was still crushing on her. &quot;Okay.&quot; Sarah replied as the two went to finger paint and Glitter smiled as she began to take polaroid pictures of the girls doing activities as they both grew up.<br />
<br />
The three of them made friendship bracelets at 3, they dressed up and had a tea party at 5, played hide and seek at 6 years old, sung a little kareoke at 7. Glitter, Sarah, and Aoloa drew pictures of each other at 8 years old, with Sarah drawing a picture of herself with her mother, and Aoloa drawing a picture of herself with Sarah and Sarah kissing her on the cheek as thanks with Aoloa blushing bright red. Glitter also had a cake brought in for the girls as they reached 10 years old. They enjoyed it immensely, after a little nap where they entered into their preteen years, Sarah wanted to enjoy a little swimming and luckily the palace did have a pool for them to enjoy.<br />
<br />
As the three of them entered the pool area, a guard entered the room and saw the two now 13 year-old girls having fun with each other and was confused by the sight of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your majesty, are you entertaining some of the children affected by the battle?&quot; The guard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, see the one with the dark hair? That&#39;s Aoloa, she and the other girl were affected by a spell the other one placed on the two of them and now they&#39;re growing back up together.&quot; Glitter explained to the guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, and who&#39;s the other girl? A friend of hers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is, and she&#39;s also my daughter.&quot; Glitter said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your....your daughter?&quot; The guard asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll explain it all later, but for now....CANNONBALL!&quot; Glitter shouted as the girls looked surprised and delighted as Glitter rushed into the pool and splashed down beside them soaking the two of them more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Sarah said while giggling as she splashed the two of them.<br />
<br />
After the pool, the three of them cleaned up and watched an old tape of the cartoon made by a friend of Sarah&#39;s parents. Sarah and Aoloa laughed at some of the moments and how much engulfed in the 1980s it was. &quot;Mom, isn&#39;t there something that&#39;s more...I don&#39;t know, closer to our culture?&quot; 15 year-old Sarah asked her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there was this other cartoon your father and I caught on the morning after he and I....&quot; Glitter began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, for the love of god, please don&#39;t say after you two had sex.&quot; Sarah pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it, not me. But fine, after your father and I had our....&#39;sleepover&#39;, I woke  up and found this cartoon about an old distant cousin of mine, Niamh was her name. Anyway, this cartoon was very enjoyable.&quot; Glitter said as she put in the tape and they all watched it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is it spelled &#39;faeries&#39; and not &#39;fairies&#39;?&quot; Aoloa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, everyone has alway debated on how to spell it for years. But they do have very creative designs, I think the man who did them later helped make a fantasy movie with some extraordinary looking puppets.&quot; Glitter explained.<br />
<br />
As they watched the cartoon, Aoloa looked over at Sarah and was feeling a little shy about it, but grabbed Sarah&#39;s hand as she reached 16 years-old. Aoloa was a little surprised when Sarah held onto it tighter as she looked over at Aoloa and batted her eyelashes and smiled at her.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Aoloa took more pictures together with the polaroid camera. They had made their way into Glitter&#39;s bedchambers soon and Sarah noticed all the portraits of the previous queens before with their child beside them, she then noticed the last one with her mother alone. Sarah now sat down on the bed looking a little sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; 18 year-old Aoloa asked. &quot;She&#39;s been alone all these years, my parents never came forward about it, she never came back herself to keep me safe, the only people close to her were the people in the palace and even then they all had someone to go home to. She was just here by herself. I wish I had found out about her sooner.&quot; Sarah explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look on the bright side, you&#39;ve given her a whole lifetime of memories in a single day. What more could you give her? You&#39;re her daughter, the princess, you just have to say it out loud.&quot; Aoloa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out loud? That&#39;s a great idea, Aoloa, you&#39;re beautiful and brilliant!&quot; 21 year-old Sarah said as she planted a long passionate kiss on Aoloa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta go tell my mom something.&quot; Sarah said as she got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay....I&#39;ll......I&#39;ll just be in here treasuring this....kiss....oh....&quot; Aoloa said as she fell back on the bed.<br />
<br />
The now 24 year-old Sarah soon found her mother talking with some of the people in the palace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I talk to you a moment?&quot; Sarah asked Glitter as she smiled and asked the others to come back later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I....I want to be formally announced as the princess. Everyone at S.P.E.A.R. knows it, Spark and her family know it, but I want our people to know it, I want them to know I&#39;ll be there for them should anything happen to them. I want to help the world, but I want to help the world I&#39;m from too.&quot; Sarah said as she aged back into her early thirties again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dear, I&#39;ll arrange for a public announcement later today. I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re doing this, your father would be happy to know you got to know me.&quot; Glitter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve...been wondering something,&quot; Sarah now stopped to ask as she finally returned to her normal age. &quot;Did you really love dad, or was it just a passing phase?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitter took a deep inhale and exhale before shaking her head and smiling. &quot;When I met your parents, I had never met a man like Jon before. He was kind, funny, he wanted to give so much back to the world. I thought I had finally found a kindred spirit, then when he and I learned we were going to have you, I got so excited, but then I got so scared. I realized that if people found out that the queen of the fairies had a baby, others might come after me. Your father and I discussed all this with Annie afterwards. She was shocked at what we had done, yes, but she was forgiving as though I realized that your father and I had shared a wonderful night, that was all it was, just a night of passion that we knew we could never get back. After that I realized I loved your father, but I wasn&#39;t in love with him. We agreed that the best thing that could have happened was you. So in answer to your question, yes I did love your father. He has never left my mind once, nor has Annie. You aren&#39;t just my daughter, your their daughter as well.&quot; Glitter explained as Sarah&#39;s eyes teared up a little as she hugged Glitter and embraced her in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks mom.&quot; Sarah said as Glitter hugged her daughter back.<br />
<br />
A few hours went by as everything was prepared for the announcement. Queen Glitter had Aoloa spread word that Glitter was to make a proclamation come sunset. Glitter had a few of her hairdressers come in to see Sarah and they were surprised and delighted to be one of the first to know about the new princess. Sarah was dressed in a similar outfit to that of her mother with an ocean blue dress color with gold highlights. Sarah had changed into her fairy form so her hairstylist could finish coming it in a beautiful curls. Finally Glitter had come in to complete the ensemble holding up a small chest containing beautiful earrings and a small crown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mother, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Sarah thanked Glitter as she looked up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re heirlooms, I actually wore this same crown when your grandmother announced me. Now you get to wear it when I announce you, my Sarathea.&quot; Glitter said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Sarah hugged her mother as Glitter went to go make the announcement on the balcony of the palace. Aoloa came up to her, she was also back to normal at the same age as Sarathea now dressed formally for Sarah&#39;s reveal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you nervous?&quot; Aoloa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little, it&#39;s certainly not like standing in front of a classroom to show off your project.&quot; Sarah joked as Aoloa laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you could use a slightly different look.&quot; Sarah said as she began to move her hand. &quot;Please don&#39;t make me young again.&quot; Aoloa said rolling her eyes. &quot;No don&#39;t worry Aoloa,&quot; Sarah smirked. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that. Now Halloween and Trick or Treating though is another story.&quot; Sarah promised as she used her magic that Glitter had taught her to make Aoloa&#39;s hair a little longer as she tied it in a long ponytail, she added lipstick and eyelashes, but for a final touch, the armored suit that Aoloa was wearing now had the symbol of Glitter&#39;s family on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s all this for?&quot; Aoloa said with a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a great friend, you&#39;re a great lover, now Aoloa (don&#39;t worry this isn&#39;t a marriage vow), would you me the honor of being my personal royal bodyguard?&quot; Sarah asked as she held Aoloa&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course I will, my princess. So does that mean you don&#39;t love me as much anymore?&quot; Aoloa asked as Sarah kissed her gently on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never loved a woman like you before and you&#39;re the only woman I&#39;ll ever love like this. I want you to stay beside me, because you helped me discover my roots. I&#39;ll always be grateful to you for that. Come on, I want you to stand beside me when mother announces me.&quot; Sarah said pulling Aoloa&#39;s arm giggling.<br />
<br />
They made their way to the back of the balcony where a massive crowd had gathered below the palace to see what the proclamation was Queen Glitter had, they all had hoped it was good news considering that battle that had taken place not too long ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;My fellow citizens, I am here to tell you something I have kept hidden for many years. I told you years ago that I made a journey to the human world to visit a granddaughter, but that was only a half-truth. Years ago, when I went to the human world, I fell in love and had a child. I kept the child hidden for years to ensure her safety and that one day she would return to her home. She has returned now and some of you may have already met her, as she arrived with backup to our battlefields not too long ago and saved many of our people. Now at last, I&#39;m proud to announce her, my daughter: Princess Sarathea!&quot; Queen Glitter announced as Sarahthea came forward on the balcony next to her mother with Aoloa walking a little ways behind her.<br />
<br />
Many fairies below clapped though not as loud at first. Then two fairies below looked closer at her as she came forward. &quot;I recognize her, she rescued Hawthorn and I on the battlefield!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She encouraged me to keep on fighting!&quot; Another could be heard shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was amazing fighting with that stun baton of hers!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My parents were rescued by her when they were trapped by one of those bad guys!&quot; A young fairy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She united all those other supernatural beings to save us! Hail Princess Sarahthea, the Unifier!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail Princess Sarahthea the Unifier! Princess Sarahthea the Unifier!&quot; The crowd cheered as Sarah looked surprised and delighted as she looked like she was about to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to smile and wave at them, dear.&quot; Glitter reminded her daughter as they both waved down at the crowd.<br />
<br />
Sarah felt a feeling of great belonging now, she was welcomed by those at S.P.E.A.R. and now she was being adored and admired by the fairies of her homeland. Sarah felt happy and Glitter couldn&#39;t help but feel proud of her daughter.</p>
