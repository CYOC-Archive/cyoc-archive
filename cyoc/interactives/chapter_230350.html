<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was so excited looking at his new body that he didn&#39;t notice Jerome stayed longer at the stage talking with Madame Illusia. She was nodding to something he told her while he smiled very happy. A minute later, he left and went back to his seat which wasn&#39;t too far from Andy&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Several magic acts later, Madame Illusia&#39;s show was over. The age swap between Andy and Jerome was the most exciting act but the show was quite entertaining even though. Andy was feeling his new muscles all the time, he was in love with them. Jerome was watching him occasionally.<br />
<br />
When people started to leave, Jerome approached Andy and offered to give him some more of his muscles. &quot;I have a lot more to give. Hahaha. What do you think, boy?&quot; Jerome was younger but was still an impressive male specimen full of raw power and manliness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not boy! Not anymore.&quot; Andy replied. &quot; And yes. I won&#39;t mind be bigger. Being a grown up is so cool!!&quot; Jerome didn&#39;t say anything else. He just grinned and guided Andy to Madame Illusia&#39;s tent where it seems she was already waiting for them. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. Gentlemen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Illusia. The boy... I mean... Andy, has accepted my offer. He agrees to receive something more from me.&quot; Jerome said with a growing anxiety being noticeable through his voice. &quot;Is that true, Andy?&quot; The former kid nodded while he tried to act more serious and mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. So, to begin this exchange you should grab each other hand and stay like that until I tell you to stop. Understood?&quot; Both men nodded and then they did what Madame Illusia told them. A tingle moved from Jerome to Andy indicating it was working. The magic had started.<br />
<br />
Andy was beyond happiness when he noticed his already big muscles swelling even more. His biceps, triceps, pecs, abs, thighs and other muscles were pumping up like balloons while thick veins popped out on there and there. He doesn&#39;t noticed it but he even was getting a few inches taller.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems you&#39;re taking my height. I&#39;m almost 7 feet tall, so you should expect to bend down to go through a few doors!&quot; Jerome laughed while Andy just smiled. The idea of becoming a giant sounded exciting to him. He definitely was going to tower over his big brother now, he thought.<br />
<br />
Jerome can feel Andy&#39;s hand was getting bigger than his. He looked down and noticed that something similar was happening with their feet. &quot;I won&#39;t have to order special shoes anymore!&quot; Jerome thought while he looked at his feet shrinking to a regular size 10 while Andy&#39;s feet reached the impressive size 18.<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly Andy moaned in pleasure when he felt the exchange had already reached his genitals. However he didn&#39;t know that Jerome wasn&#39;t an endowed guy. He was below average, so he grinned when his dick grew while Andy&#39;s was turning smaller. Jerome was to burst in laughing because of Andy&#39;s continuous moans.<br />
<br />
It was almost done. They had exchanged muscles, height, even foot sizes. But Jerome&#39;s true intention wasn&#39;t any of that. In fact, when he approached to Madame Illusia he just wanted to get rid of his copious amount of body hair. It&#39;s been a curse his whole life and now it&#39;s going to be Andy&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He knew that he could get some muscles back if he exercises enough, but those nasty coarse hairs were different. He was tired of waxing, lame jokes about being a bear or an ape, and smelling like sweat even after taking shower. &quot;Andy is young, he would bear it.&quot; Jerome thought while he felt the magic working.<br />
<br />
The hair on his back was the first to go, then it was the one on his shoulders, his nose and ears. Jerome smiled when he noticed the hair on his arms thinning and then vanishing out. Same with his chest, belly and knuckles. He was a little bit sad when his beard disappeared but he knew it was necessary.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andy was so mesmerized by his newly gotten muscles that he didn&#39;t realize about the hair growing on his back, shoulder, ears and nose. It wasn&#39;t until he watched Jerome&#39;s beard fanning out that he realized that something was odd. He put his free hand on his chest and felt the thick pelt of hair. He immediately freaked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your hair!&quot; Andy shouted. &quot; Your body hair is growing on me!!&quot; He doesn&#39;t sound as excited as before. &quot;Yes, Madame Illusia said I can give it to you if you agreed. I told you I&#39;m going to give all of me!!&quot; Jerome can&#39;t contain his laughing this time and began to laugh a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want your body hair! I would look like a gross monkey!&quot; Andy complained. &quot;Monkey, bear, ape, sasquatch. I&#39;ve heard all those nickname. Better you get used to hear them too! Hahaha!!&quot; Jerome kept laughing. &quot;NOOO!!!&quot; Andy yelled trying to free his hand but Jerome wasn&#39;t going to release him until the last hair on his butt is transferred to Andy.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia who was watching the transformation all this time, just smiled satisfied. She didn&#39;t do this kind of magic acts on stage, but they&#39;re definitely her favorites. Like any other witch, she enjoys of humiliating and tricking mortals, especially young naive ones like Andy.</p>
