<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agatha was sat on a park bench. Just looking, looking for people to punish. She sat there for hours just waiting. She was surprised that the no one appeared to be misbehaving.<br />
<br />
That was until three teenage girls entered the park. The first of the three was a tall girl with blonde hair that reached her shoulders and a face with far too much make up on. Her figure was accentuated as well, she was clearly wearing a padded bra and tight leggings to accentuate her almost flat butt.<br />
<br />
The second girl looked alot more normal. Her brown hair was done up in a tight bun and her face was plain. But what this girl lacked in her face she made up for with her figure. She must have been at least a D cup and the skinniest of the three girls. She also had long legs and an ass to match but she was wearing loose jeans and a turtleneck sweater . So she was obviously concerned by her figure.<br />
<br />
The third girl however looked to be one of the biggest sluts Agatha had ever seen. Her face had far too much make up on and her blond hair was flowing behind her. Her figure was extreme as well, her breasts were bigger than the second girl at at least an F cup and her ass and legs were more toned<br />
.<br />
<br />
<br />
This girl was clearly the leader of the group.<br />
<br />
The three girls sat down on a bench for a minute talking but then they spotted another girl on a picnic table. The girl had been their since Agatha had arrived and had been studying the whole time. <br />
The girls obviously knew her as they walked over to her laughing and talking. Agatha snapped her fingers and turned herself invisible so she could watch the girls, this was the most interesting thing Agatha had seen in the four hours she had been at the park so she wanted to see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sam&quot; said the slutty girl to the girl studying. The girl looked up and jumped a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um hello Jenni&quot; replied the girl &quot;do you need anything at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Kim, Jane and I need to borrow your bag if that&#39;s okay.&quot; Said Jenni with that she took Sam&#39;s bag and ran off with Kim and Jane. At first it looked like Sam was going to get up to follow them but then she just sighed and sat back down, she adjusted her glasses and went off in the other direction, presumably home.<br />
<br />
Agatha was shocked, in her 200 years of being a ghost she had never seen anything as bad as that. She decided to follow the other girls to find out what they were up to.<br />
<br />
The girls ran out of the park, out onto the sidewalk and into a nearby house. Agatha presumed it was one of the girls&#39; houses, this was proved right when they went into a room with a sign on the door that said Jane. This also allowed Agatha to find out who was who out of the girls. Jane was the flat one and Kim was the skinny one.<br />
They sat down on Jane&#39;s bed and emptied the bag. Inside was just some study materials and some cash, but after further searching the girls found Sam&#39;s diary. It read Samantha&#39;s diary on the leather cover in big gold letters. <br />
The girls were faced with a problem however, there was a lock on the front of the diary that stopped them from opening it. Agatha quickly fixed this and undid the lock just so she could see what the girls would do.<br />
<br />
The girls read through the diary, most of it was standard stuff any girl would right about but they got to a certain page close to the end and stopped. This page was different to the rest as there were random ink blots across the page from where tears had fallen onto the page.<br />
Jenni who had established herself as the leader of the group, snatched the book away and began to read aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear diary. I&#39;m considering suicide, they just wont stop. Today they put there boyfriends on me who tripped me in front of the entire school. Then Jenni and Kim stole my sketchbook, which had ALL of my drawings in and they wouldn&#39;t give it back until I told miss Smith. But when they gave it back they had graffitid the entire thing and all of my drawings were ruined.<br />
Then during gym class they stole my bra and tied it too a flag pole, so I had to climb the pole to get it back, it took me half an hour.<br />
I don&#39;t know diary, I&#39;ll have to see what happens tomorrow.&quot;<br />
The girls were crying with laughter but Agatha was crying for another reason; pity. She decided she was going to punish the girls but wasn&#39;t sure how. That was until the girls suggested they go to the mall bra shopping.<br />
<br />
Agatha snapped her fingers and appeared at the mall in the most popular underwear shop in town. She snapped her fingers again making it so that she was the only employee, but everyone thought this was normal. Agatha looked down. Her black dress had been replaced with a black polo shirt and leggings.<br />
<br />
Agatha waited for half an hour, luckily no one came in until the girls arrived. They each went up to the counter and asked for a bra fitting. Agatha told them to wait in the changing rooms. When they were in there she snapped her fingers and next to her appeared to clones of Agatha. She snapped her fingers again making it so they each looked slightly different. One was now ginger with a flat chest where as the other was now shorter with blond hair and a small belly yet the original agatha stayed the same.<br />
<br />
The original Agatha went into the same changing room as Jenni, the ginger Agatha went into the same changing room as Jane and the blond version of Agatha went into the same room as Kim.<br />
<br />
Jenni was already topless in just her bra waiting for a fitter, when Agatha entered she stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my name is Agatha and I&#39;m going to be fitting you today. Now, is there a problem is your bra too small or the wrong size or do you just want to know the right size?&quot; Asked Agatha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for the past two days my bra has been digging into my shoulders and I think it&#39;s too small.&quot; Replied Jenni.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what size is this one your wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a 36F&quot; Agatha pretended to know what she was doing and made a few measurements of Jenni.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to break it to you but that bra is far too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what do you mean&quot; as she asked this Agatha snapped her fingers making Jenni only a B cup. Then Jenni looked down, she screamed; loudly.<br />
Agatha snapped her fingers teleporting Jenni, Jane, Kim and herself to an attic room.<br />
&quot;Now girls where shall we start?&quot;</p>
