Finals chapter 1: New Rules<br />
<br />
Megan walked down the hallway to her class. She walked in and waited for the teacher. She was wearing a skirt today, not too short, not too long, but nice. In the class there was a bunch of jerks who liked fooling with the girls. The one that did this often and gave it to the rest of the class, was Fredrick. He was one of those gangster wanna bees. He always said yo, always had a stupid handshake, a pierced ear; you get the gist. She sat there waiting for the teacher to walk in and start.<br />
<br />
That moment happened within a few minutes of her sitting down. A girl walked in in an outfit that made her look professional.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am your new teacher.&quot; She announced, &quot;As you all know, the finals are coming up, and I know all of you will pass.&quot; She said this like she knew we really were. She passed next to her desk holding a long stick in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;The way it’s going to work from now until the finals is you will answer me right or wrong. Right will give you rewards, wrong will give you things you don&#39;t want. For example, let’s do this...&quot;<br />
She went into her desk and pulled out a piece of paper. She cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is 2 + 5 - 6 + ÷ 2 × 0?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan knew the answer to this one. The others however such as Fredrick probably would be here for days just trying to figure out how to do 2 + 5. After a minute, someone raised their hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;0?&quot; She asked. The teacher smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct! A reward granted to you.&quot; Said the teacher. She flicked the stick and before everyone&#39;s eyes the girl who raised her hand began to adjust her shirt alot. We than noticed that she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra for her nipples poked through her once loose shirt as her boobs expanded from a B or C cup to a D. She held them in her hands and laid them on the desk for they were extremely large and she didn’t have a bra to hold them. All the guys drooled at her boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;The more you get right, the more things happen to your body that you will enjoy.&quot; The teacher explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens if you get stuff wrong?&quot; Asked someone else from the back. The teacher chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things happen to your body that you won’t enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Asked another girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer me this, who was the first President of the United States?&quot; The teacher asked. This was a mistake for this particular girl for she was blond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Benjamin Franklin?&quot; She asked. The teacher gleamed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That your final answer?&quot; She asked, &quot;If so, stand up and tell the class.&quot; The blond stood up quickly, slamming her hand on the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I got this one right. The first President of the United States is Benjamin Franklin! *gasp*&quot; She gasped once she was done and quickly sat down. She seemed to be fiddling with her skirt. Alot of people were staring at her as she did this, but Megan was the one who got a clear shot under the desk. She could see her purple underwear in between her legs in her skirt. She was fiddling with a bulge that was protruding from under her skirt in her purple undies. The blond was blushing a dark red. Whatever was growing down below was giving her an immense feeling, and to top it off, she was getting flashes of what she would do to all the women in her class room. She jumped again and looked down at her skirt to see the bulge becoming bigger and whatever it was, was straining on the edge of her skirt like a tent pole. Megan saw what was coming out of her panties. It was a thick rod which made her wet by looking at. The blond was extremely horny and removed the skirt to see what it was, and was shocked at first, that is...  until she accidentally swiped it. It gave her an immense pleasure and she squirmed at her desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get rid of it please!&quot; She shouted in tears from not wanting it, and enjoying it. The teacher shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. What happens to you is permanent.“ The blond continued to squirm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, blondie?&quot; Said Fredrick, &quot;The first President of the United States is George Mannington.&quot; Once the wrong words came out of his mouth, he abruptly stopped. He felt he chest becoming uncomfortable. He breathed quickly, &quot;What did you do?&quot; He asked the teacher, angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;If neither of you have guessed it by now, which I should punish you for, but I won’t. The more you mess up, the more your changed into your opposite sex. Fredrick was it? Like women&#39;s breasts?&quot;<br />
He looked down wide eyed and saw beneath his tight shirt, two bulges, with nipples poking against his shirt. They grew to a C cup. He touched them in shock and breathed in abruptly before removing his hands from his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo…  stupid.&quot; A girl stood up in the back 2 desks behind Megan, who was mocking Fredrick, &quot;Its George Washington *gasp*!&quot; She quickly sat down and fiddled with her crotch. It wasn&#39;t because she said it wrong, but because the teacher built up her lust in her privates. She began to squirm and moan trying to hold back touching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the bathroom and take care of that.&quot; Said the teacher. With that she quickly dashed toward the bathroom, dripping down her thighs, &quot;As for the rest of you...&quot; She snapped her fingers, &quot;Complete these questions.&quot; Paper and pencil appeared on everyone’s desk. The teacher than swiped her wand at the chalk board and the chalk began writing on its own. This is what it wrote:<br />
<br />
A+ - expansion of your choice<br />
A - expansion of teacher’s choice<br />
B - Immense feeling from teacher choice of area<br />
C - slight of both opposite sex expansion and regular sex expansion<br />
D - small expansion of opposite sex<br />
F - major opposite sex expansion <br />
<br />
&quot;This will be the new chart for completing your assignments. Follow it. Right it down if you want. Be aware I don’t give mercy for you all being stupid.&quot; She paused to look at her clock, you have 30 minutes to get the questions answered. Beginning...  now!&quot; Everyone leaned forward quickly and answered the questions.<br />
<br />
Megan looked at the questions and snickered. She knew every answer on the sheet. There were 10 in all.<br />
 <br />
1.	  Who was the second president of the United States? John Adams<br />
 2.	 What is 12&quot; also known as? 1 foot<br />
 3.	 What is the capital of the United States? Washington D.C<br />
 4.	 What was the year of Abraham&#39;s assassination? 1882 <br />
 5.	 What did Abraham Lincoln do as President? Stopped Slavery<br />
 6.	 What was the terrorist attack that we are still struggling with today? 9/11<br />
<br />
They were all pretty simple. Megan finished hers and cupped her hands on the desk. It was another 15 minutes before everyone else was done. The teacher snapped her fingers and the papers disappeared as soon as the bell rang. The people that weren&#39;t done were still in writing pose for a moment while their brain registered the loss of paper and pencil.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shall see who has done good or bad. Go get some lunch and come back here for your reward or punishment. One last thing: I am probably the nicest teacher here. No complaining, or you&#39;ll be transferred to an even nastier teacher that will do worse to your bodies faster.&quot; She tapped the board with the grading system, &quot;This may seem nasty, but it’s not as bad compared to the other teachers. Remember that. Have a good lunch.&quot;</p>
