<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt fell down on Langston’s bed, and Langston was on top of him in a moment. Kissing Langston felt electric, it felt right. His body was responding to Langston in a way it never had before with anyone else. The part of Matt that had become part of Langston was overwhelming all of his senses.<br />
<br />
Langston broke the embrace for one moment, looking at his phone.<br />
<br />
“Oh man,” he said. “It’s almost time. Roll over.”<br />
<br />
Matt did what he was told, and Langston grabbed Matt’s legs, pulling his torso closer. Langston looked at Matt with a mischievous grin, then stuck his long tounge out and bent down. Matt gasped as Langston’s tounge rimmed the edges of his asshole. Warmth exploded through his body, lingering with the strange transformative energy. Matt unconsciously placed his hands on his knees, as a grinding sound filled the air. Behind Langston’s head, Matt’s feet pressed together and began to stretch, absorbing into each other and merging. Matt’s fingers began to elongate as they merged with the warm skin of his thighs. Matt turned his head slightly to look, and then felt his torso pulled up slightly with a gentle crack. It didn’t hurt. His rib cage was cracking and melting, the bones of his arms elongating and merging with his legs. Matt felt himself rising slightly off the bed, Langston’s head still deep in his ass. <br />
<br />
Then, Matt’s reality began to change. The bed started to grow, and Langston’s tounge inside of him grew as well, stretching his tight asshole. Matt groaned as he slowly shrunk further, his now fully merged arms and legs stretching as they grew smaller and thinner, wrapping around Langston’s muscular neck. His merged feet began to harden, reshaping into a fastener of some sort that attached his leg/arms together. <br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me?” Moaned Matt as his body temperature began to decrease. He leaned back against Langston, feeling the warmth of the black man’s body and smelling his delicious scent.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to be hanging around with me a lot more,” Langston pulled out for a moment. He gasped for a moment, and then began to rim Matt’s stretching asshole. <br />
<br />
Matt was only 2 feet long now, dwarfed by the gigantic bedsheets and Langston on the bed. Langston’s tounge was now as large as his entire torso, yet it still licked and gently massaged his stretching asshole. He was so small and light now, he looked more like a doll than a human. His arms and legs, now thin as sticks and beginning to develop swelling bumps all over, began to harden and stiffen into steel. The steel was spreading down his digits, which now resembled a long, thin chain. His abs began to sink into his torso, his nipples glazing over as Matt’s shrunken flesh began to cool into hard steel.<br />
<br />
Matt was completely unprepared for what happened next - He suddenly and without warning shrank even further, and his torso deformed and condensed on itself as it flattened and reshaped around Langston’s tounge. Matt gasped and opened his tiny mouth wide… the tounge was visible inside. All of a sudden Matt’s head began to retract back into his morphing torso, as Langston’s tounge pushed through the other side. His ears and hair withdrew into what was left of his head. His tiny eyes were now on the edges of the rounded ring-like object he had become, wrapped around Langston’s tounge. As Langston’s saliva dropped down onto the ring, the eyes glazed over as well. <br />
<br />
Sweaty and out of breath, Langston rolled over on the bed alone, his new steel ring pendant landing on the soft yet hard surface of his pectorals. He rubbed the circumference of the ring with his fingers as he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Matt was in euphoria, his body thrilling to the touch of Langston’s fingers teasing his body which was now as sensitive as his asshole had been. He laid on Langston’s chest, feeling and tasting the sweaty muscles that he rested on. Then suddenly, his chain was being pulled. His legs were being twisted around until his feet were on the front. The huge, strong fingers unclasped his feet and pulled him free from his chain. He was moving through the air. Suddenly, Langston’s gigantic cock was in his view. Matt knew what was coming but the anticipation was nothing compared to the result. Matt was pressed against Langston’s coco head and then gently pulled down the great shaft to rest at the bottom of it, against Langston’s swelled balls. The salty taste of Langston’s sweat, the smell of his cock and balls were almost too much. Now, underwear was being pulled up around him, sealing him inside Langston’s crotch. Matt hugged the shaft lovingly. He hoped Langston would never take him off.<br />
<br />
Langston left his house and went to his classes, all day leaving Matt wrapped around his cock. He was hard almost all day, enjoying the feeling of what had been Matt around his dick at all times. Every so often Langston felt a slight tug on his dick, and that was all he needed to give him another raging erection.</p>
