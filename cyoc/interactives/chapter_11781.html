<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two Ladies returned to the barn, Prince Daniel was already fitted into the mating stall. The Doc was sitting at the computer typing away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you working with Daniel privately?&quot; asked Sybil.<br />
<br />
Doc Hornaday looked up from his typing then smiled. &quot;No, I have been changing the printouts to read better!&quot; said Doc.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane picked up the most recent printout and read, &quot;Hey Virgil, I'm really happy Miss Jane got this thing for me to tell what has been bottled up inside Daniel!&quot; Daniel thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes this is better on the eyes please continue, excellent work Doc!&quot; agreed Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
Again Sybil sat to the left of Daniel's faced self. Miss Jane sat to the right and Doc sat to the rear at the computer watching the printout and vitals as Daniel's thoughts printed out in the tray.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Daniel you talked much this morning about your passion and lust for those mares you love, tell us what thought about living the life of a pony.&quot; asked Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
Daniel stirred a little in his tight stall. Shaking his mane as if trying to clear the fog out of that pony head and tell what he remembered. &quot;Daniel, afraid at first...Daniel now an animal living with brute animals born as animals being as animals...jealous animals..cunning animals..bite..kick..shove Daniel..must learn to fend for Daniel's right to live...Daniel must learn to be as brute like as jealous as beastly of actions to be allowed respect by the brutes about Daniel...&quot;Thought Daniel.<br />
<br />
Doc Hornaday pointed toward Daniel motioning for Miss Jane's attention to look at the pony as his thoughts were printed out his maleness hung erect.<br />
<br />
Even as Daniel was busy thinking his experiances the almost unconscience act of masturbation began to mix between the thoughts suggestion his deep feelings about the memories.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane gave a simple nod as to what Doc pointed to knowing the common actions of a stallion quite well. Daniel though being originally a human was now much entwined into the life and actions thereof the Dartmoor pony stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please go on Daniel, tell us more of your first days here at the farm.&quot; said Miss Jane in a warm and friendly manner.<br />
<br />
Daniel snorted softly then found his thought. &quot;Daniel found Lilly to help Daniel accept and be accepted by the other mares as she offered herself for Daniel's passion. Marge helped too and after that those mares not attached to some other male pony's harem came over to Daniel....Daniel became proud of what was his herd..Ran trotted played together seperate of the other part of those held in here...Daniel felt free yet caged by fences....needed to learn farm fences...captive not able to roam free as when myself...this is now me Daniel try to dry for self..can't cry...feel low at night..hang head droop tail. Marge and Lilly good friends they human before like Daniel...come and make touching..try to lift Daniel's spirits....&quot;Daniel's thoughts stopped as a roaring splatter of pony semen spewed out his erect rigid cock. <br />
<br />
Sybil jerked her legs away but caught most of Daniel's load.<br />
<br />
Standing up she looked down to see the stinking yellow globs of rich semen and the flood of cum running down her slacks. Turning to leave in disgust and haste even Daniel had to notice what just occured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel sorry Mom..Daniel an animal now...act like animal.. please forgive Daniel..please forgive...&quot; Daniel's thoughts would often trail of into pure on languagal jibberish of mixed letters making no words but still a type of animal mentality communication.<br />
<br />
As Daniel and Miss Jane continued the session, a messed up Sybil walked sternly back to the main house. Once in her bedroon Sybil removed her nice slacks and took them into the bathroom for a washing.<br />
<br />
Turning on the shower she looked at the slacks feeling disfgust over the mess. During her walk from the barn to house the cum dried to a crusty white as if a starch covered the slack's material. The yellowed globs of Daniel's rich count semen still clung in soft jellylike state.<br />
<br />
Holding the slacks under hot water the cum slowly began to soften. The globs clung yet and Sybil was force to  pick at them with her fingers.<br />
<br />
Glob after sticky glob removed off the cloth they stuck to Sybil's hand instead. Shaking her hand they still clung tight making her thick of what those mares felt as their wombs filled with Daniel's cum and seed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Sybil was captivated by her palm almost covered in thick sticky globs of Daniel her pony stallion Son's semen. The rinsed water changed not the thick consistancy and it's smell still was a crude odor. Yet as she stood there looking at the globs her thoughts turned toward devouring her Son's seed.<br />
<br />
Quickly and in her own sudden feeling of passion Sybil opened her mouth wide. Teeth bit out like eating a bite of some apple. The globs seperated from Sybil's palm and soon filled Sybil's mouth with a thick goowy slime. <br />
<br />
Turning in absolute disgust of the rank taste Sybil looked for her drinking glass which normally sat by the sink. As her luck would have it the maid had removed it and not yet returned to place a clean on there.<br />
<br />
The semen globs were accepting well the action of Sybil's saliva mix with her own body's heat. Globs were returning to the fluid state as when coming from the testicles of pony stallion Daniel. Even as Sybil spit into the sink she swallowed some of the slime.<br />
<br />
Choking and coughing Sybil felt horridly foolish for what she had done.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment the Maid came back to Sybil's room and walked in on the half undressed lady. As Sybil was bent over the washbasin spiting and coughing the room filled with rank odors of equine semen, the Maid screamed and setting the glass down ran out the room.<br />
<br />
Sybil not carring about the Maid's thinkings had her own problem right then. Taking the glass she filled it with water and swished out her mouth. <br />
<br />
Nothing, the semen was oily and continued to stick inside her mouth over teeth and gums.<br />
<br />
Fumbling with the medicine cabinet she looked about for some mouthwash, anything to cut the taste and clean her mouth. The cabinet was well stocked with everything but a mouthwash. Grabbing at straws Sybil took hold a spray bottle of allergy nasel saline liquid. Opening her mouth the yellow strings of Daniel's pony semen hung everywhere. <br />
<br />
Spray, spray, spray, the saline spray was fast cutting the semen's hold making the spitting of it out possible. After some minutes of fright and disgust the problem had lessoned away. Redressing Sybil hurried back to the barn for the session with Daniel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry what did I miss?&quot; asked Sybil as she again plopped into her chair.<br />
<br />
Daniel was mid sentence explaining his conquest of a mare when his nostrils flared wide. As his large nose caught the scent so did Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane jumped up and taking hold of Sybil's shoulder she asked the obvious question on her and Daniel's mind, &quot;You did't ingest any of Daniel's semen did you Sybil?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sybil's face turned red, she moved uneasy about her chair and looking into Miss Jane's eyes she blinked and nodded a yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy going to join Daniel's herd....&quot; came printing out off the printer.<br />
<br />
Doc got up and gave the printout directly to Sybil. She read it and then looked at Doc and Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really?&quot; sybil questioned the printout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; replied Doc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; said Miss Jane.<br />
<br />
Daniel pawed the ground and snorted his delights.<br />
<br />
Sybil looked worried at both people and then looked at her stallion Son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please try to understand, Daniel's semen is rich with properties of the Professor Haun's transition formula. It's original composition was much higher in  equine metamorphic abilities. The enzyme remains in the host body for years. If Daniel had had intercourse with some female after injections began she would also become a Dartmoor pony over time. If you ingested his raw untainted semen now the ultimate result will be you Sybil are going to change genus!&quot; announced Doc.<br />
<br />
Stunned and sitting looking up suddenly, Sybil burped!<br />
<br />
A happy Daniel pawed the barn floor and whinnied.</p>
