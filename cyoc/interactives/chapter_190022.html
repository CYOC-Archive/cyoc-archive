<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reham the twelve foot giraffe panted out the last of her sexual release as it ebbed away and let out a content sigh. She raised her nose up and sniffed the air, inhaling the musky scent of her own animal orgasm and feeling if waft ten times stronger than normal through his big nostrils.<br />
<br />
Mmmm. Smelt delicious.<br />
<br />
Combined with the remnants of her own cinnamon tinged perfume it was a spicy and delightful scent. The giraffe let out a final pleased sigh of satisfaction and turned off the bed, thudding her giant cloven hooves to the floor and lying in an incredibly awkward half crouch in her room. Her head brushed the ceiling and she felt her big strong heart pumping blood through her thick walled veins.<br />
<br />
She blinked her long dark lashes, turning her head back to take stock of herself, and managed a deep voiced giggle as she considered the absurdity of the day’s events. One moment she had been worried about home work. The next she was a horny giraffe. Sure! Why not?<br />
<br />
Of course, she knew fully well who was responsible and with what impossibility he had done it. Now the question was what should she do about it? Well, obviously, she couldn’t stay a giraffe in her apartment forever. As she considered these things in her head, her phone dinged somewhere in the living room.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. Curiosity got the better of her. She crawled her way around the door frame, her thick rump in the air, and managed to squeeze out the door just barely. She eyed her phone on the couch and saw a new text. Odd, nobody texted her.<br />
<br />
She crawled closer and craned her neck down for the better look.<br />
<br />
“Hey Reham!!” The text read, “Hope you made it home before you went down on all fours. Is the ceiling okay?? Best, Joey xoxo”<br />
<br />
The giraffe’s eyes widened and she let out another delightful giggle of mirth.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Sarah!” She said in her new husky voice. The phone dinged and waited. “Send my location!”<br />
<br />
Another ding and her GPS location popped up on the phone. Dot dot dot, Joey was writing back.<br />
<br />
“Okay! I’m on my way!”<br />
<br />
Sure, Reham rolled her eyes. Of course you are. Likely want to see what you’ve done to me you weirdo.<br />
<br />
The giraffe sighed. She flicked her tail absently while she waited and looked around the apartment, realizing just how big she was. A little bit of realization began to creep in and she found herself laughing again in sheer absurd amusement.<br />
<br />
Ding! Reham wheeled her head back and looked at the phone again.<br />
<br />
“Might want to hang on. Gonna change you back.”<br />
<br />
A sudden jolt made the giraffe cry out and in seconds she was shrinking down and turning human again. A very startled and somewhat horrified Reham lay naked spread out in the middle of her apartment floor, staring at the ceiling with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” she managed.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
By the time Joey arrived the beautiful Arab girl had redressed and showered off her fresh animal shame. When the bell buzzed, she felt a jolt of terror in her stomach and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
She made it downstairs and met Joey at the entrance door, pushing it open. He smirked playfully and she gave him a stern look.<br />
<br />
“Well, come on, giraffe boy.” She rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t the one who was a giraffe.” Joey giggled.<br />
<br />
This made Reham giggle too. “Why in Allah’s name would you do that to me?”<br />
<br />
“You’re tall. Seemed ridiculous.” He shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, so it was.” Reham shot him another look as she opened her door and let him in.<br />
<br />
“So, I was thinking...” Joey began, but as Reham closed and locked the door she swiftly struck him across the face with the sting of a bare hand.<br />
<br />
“First of all!” Reham stood with her arms crossed. “Don’t ever do that to me again. What if I hadn’t made it home? Or somebody had seen me changing? Or I had freaked out. Or wrecked my apartment! Or who knows what else!”<br />
<br />
“That’s fair.” Joey winced, rubbing his raw cheek and gulping. “I’m sorry I...”<br />
<br />
“Second!” Reham cut him off, breaking into a big grin. “I get to pick what animal next time.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, oka...” Joey stopped and blinked. There was a long awkward pause as the arab girl stood with her hands on her hips and broke into a warm and pleased smile.”<br />
<br />
“W-What was it like?” Joey leaned in suddenly, whispering conspiratorially.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you know, just the most weird thing that’s ever happened to me ever.” She blushed a little and looked away shyly, pulling back her head scarf. “Uh... it was fun though. So thanks.”<br />
<br />
Joey realized and blinked. “Fun?”<br />
<br />
“Sensual.” She blushed deeper. “You follow?”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Yeah!” Joey gulped, blushing too. “I get you. Uh... great. Well, look at the time! I should go!”<br />
<br />
“Nice try!” Reham shoved him back into the living room and pointed to her kitchen table. “You started this! Now you have to deal with the consequences. Sit down, you big pervert!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am.” Joey giggled, taking a seat at the table.<br />
<br />
“So.” Reham sat too, hands on the table. “Magic wish ring. You can clearly do whatever you’d like. I’ve got that part. I had the hooves to prove it.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed.” Joey nodded. “You have to tell me about the sensual part.”<br />
<br />
“Never ask a giraffe what she did in private!” Reham spat, blushing redder. “You obviously like me. You obviously want to play around with me. I’m not going to question that part, but where did you get the ring?”<br />
<br />
Joey told the story about the old lady, the ring, the coffee shop, and his weird dream.<br />
<br />
The dark skinned beauty considered this and smirked, rubbing her chin. “Sooo, you’ve got unlimited cosmic power just right there, on your finger.” She giggled again and blushed. “And the first thing you do is make some random girl you followed on a bus a giant African land mammal?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, pretty much.” Joey shrugged.<br />
<br />
They broke out laughing hysterically at the table.<br />
<br />
“I’m scared of how your mind works!” Reham finally snickered. “But I’m curiously intrigued with what other deviancies you can concoct.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Reham, I’ve got a million!”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm.” She nodded, crossing her arms and silently judging with a smirk. “I bet you do. What is it next? A zebra? Perhaps an ox? A goat?”<br />
<br />
“How about a camel!” Joey spat, suddenly inspired.<br />
<br />
“Sir,” Reham was taken aback. “That’s horrifyingly racist.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Joey blinked, suddenly.<br />
<br />
“What, because I’m Muslim? You want to make me a camel? A giraffe was bad enough, I’m not even African. But wow, such American prejudice.”<br />
<br />
“Uh...” Joey blushed deep red.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh.” Reham crossed her arms disapprovingly and glared. “You’re not making me a camel. Unless you turn yourself into a big fat American pig.”<br />
<br />
“A capitalist pig?” Joey grinned, seizing the moment.<br />
<br />
This caught Reham completely off guard and she broke into a laugh. “Exactly! A big smelly capitalist pig!”<br />
<br />
“Or I could make you a giraffe again. I didn’t even get to see.”<br />
<br />
“Ughh.” The arab girl sighed. “But I was way too big and I had no hands.”<br />
<br />
“Or a giraffe lady.” Joey brightened.<br />
<br />
“Am I not lady enough for you right now? Have to make me a beast?”<br />
<br />
Joey giggled. “I suppose I like you the way you are too.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Reham crossed her arms on the table and relaxed, raising an eyebrow seductively. “I guess I like you too. And I mean, I find you fascinating.”<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; Joey cracked his knuckles. &quot;What would you do if you had a magic lamp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also pretty racist.&quot; Reham sighed, shaking her head.</p>
