<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria stalked around the hotel suite for a bit, enjoying seeing the room from a foot higher than normal and getting adjusted to her new body&#39;s motions. She dropped to all fours as she sniffed the floor, sneezing as the remnants of whatever cleaning solution they used on the carpet irritated her nose slightly. She climbed back onto the bed and sniffed her scent that still was quite prominent-the sheets still damp from her transformation, and she tasted it again. She always liked the taste of herself-not to mention the effect it seemed to have on her lovers when she let them watch her lick her own fingers clean. Now though, it tasted even more amazing to her, and she found herself getting more and more aroused simply by the juices alone.<br />
<br />
She moved into the bathrooom again, admiring herself in the mirror as she flexed her new muscles and admired her large chest with a satisfied smile on her muzzle. “I am one sexy bitch,” she thought as she stared, feeling completely fulfilled in being THIS. As she stared at herself in the mirror, her hand wandered down to where her fur was the thickest, and she began to play, parting the fur to give herself access to her nub. <br />
<br />
Part of her didn&#39;t want to change back, not yet, but she was quick to remember that she could change again at any time. Almost as eagerly as she&#39;d explored her changing body, she slipped into the hot tub and turned on the jets. The freedom of knowing that there was no one here to catch her at it, and no one here to tell her it was wrong seemed to make this moment all the better, and she spread her legs eagerly as she found a pounding jet to caress her. In seconds, her hands were clawing at the tile as she pushed against the stream of water, and in only a minute or two, she hit a quick climax. Her body began to tremble and shrink as the reversion took hold, every bit as arousing and pleasurable as the transformation into the she-wolf had been.  She nearly collapsed under the water as her muscles reduced, still in ecstasy as now the water was there to vibrate her slowly shrinking clit. The reversion happened more quickly than the change, and while she was aware of a weak feeling overtaking her, it was more the good feeling of having been fucked to exhaustion, as opposed to the literal loss of muscle and height.<br />
<br />
She dragged herself out of the hot tub and lay on the bathroom floor for a minute or two before wrapping a towel around herself. After she&#39;d dried herself off, she managed to concentrate on getting clothes on – she ended up selecting a nice little black sundress. It had a deep v-cut, one that bared her breasts almost scandalously. It was almost sheer as well, and anyone who looked closely enough could see that she had no bra on. It was also fairly short. If she bent over, anyone could also see she wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear either. She slipped a pair of sandals on, and then tossed her phone and room key into her small handbag. She didn&#39;t really need much else, and truthfully, she didn&#39;t care if she forgot anything, or if someone noticed her lack of undergarments. Gloria was out to play, and what she really wanted was to find someone-or more than one someone-to play with.<br />
<br />
Heading down to the front desk, she saw the helpful girl, Amy, who&#39;d checked her in and also directed her to the introduction channel.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Gloria,” Amy said with a warm (and slightly knowing) smile. “I&#39;m presuming you..got things taken care of?”<br />
<br />
For a second, Gloria wondered if Amy somehow knew that she&#39;d gotten herself off. “Uhh..yeah, yeah, everything&#39;s fine on that front, now.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Amy said, giving her a lingering look. Gloria couldn&#39;t tell if Amy knew what she&#39;d been up to, if she was subtly flirting, or if it was all in her imagination. <br />
“So..is there anything particularly interesting you&#39;d recommend I see or do here on my first evening?” Gloria asked. It was around five PM. Check in, like at most hotels and resorts, had been at four in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Amy smiled. “Well, things tend to always be a little..steamy around here,” Amy told her, “But once it gets dark, things get more lively. Most of our animal guests seem to have a thing for the night sky. Can&#39;t say I blame &#39;em.” The young clerk smiled, and again, it seemed like there was at least a little bit of flirtation as she toyed with a ringlet of her hair.<br />
<br />
“But,” she continued after a small pause, “I think it all depends on what you&#39;re looking for.” Amy appraised Gloria for a moment, chewing her bottom lip for a second as she locked eyes with her and tilted her head slightly in concentration. “You..look like you went with something predatory, am I right?”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled in return, though she was a little surprised. “You&#39;re right. How&#39;d you know?”<br />
<br />
Amy grinned. “You just have a...look about you. I&#39;ve worked here awhile, and I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at guessing this sort of thing. A lot of us that work here kind of make a game of it.” Amy suddenly looked flustered, even blushing slightly. “Not..not that we would violate your confidentiality, or anything like that..it&#39;s just..”<br />
<br />
Gloria reached her hand over the counter and touched Amy&#39;s hand lightly. “It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m..comfortable with who I am, particularly here.” Amy relaxed almost immediately, giving Gloria a small look of gratitude.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” she said, smiling again. “Sometimes guests can be a little..jumpy, I guess would be the best word for it. Very self-conscious. They know what they want, but they haven&#39;t exactly come to terms with it.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not like them,” Gloria said, “I&#39;ve already been through that phase of my life. I&#39;m very comfortable with it, though..in the outside world, I do keep aspects of myself very..private. But there&#39;s no need for that sort of thing here.” More lingering eye contact continued between the two of them. Gloria wasn&#39;t sure now if it was her imagination or if there was real attraction going on. Was it her own desire? Amy was certainly an attractive girl, and Gloria had no illusions or conflict about her own sexuality, but she didn&#39;t want to project that onto this girl accidentally.<br />
<br />
“So..uhh..” Amy said, shifting her balance slightly awkwardly, and again getting a mildly rosy hue to her cheeks, not unlike a schoolgirl at a dance, “ If you&#39;re looking for something to eat, we&#39;ve got two main restaurants in this wing that cater to predatory mammal shifters.  There&#39;s the Raw Bar, which serves live animals for our guests who want to indulge the animal side of themselves, and then there&#39;s a standard restaurant that serves regular cooked food – a little bit of everything, but it would be classed as American cuisine. Hamburgers, steak, some Italian and Mexican stuff. That one&#39;s simply called &#39;Slice of Life&#39;, since it&#39;s so meat-heavy on the menu.”<br />
<br />
“I probably could stand to eat something,” Gloria remarked. “I haven&#39;t eaten since I was on the plane.”<br />
<br />
Amy nodded. “It&#39;s a good idea to eat regularly here. The change burns a lot of calories. There&#39;s not really a danger of you starving yourself accidentally, or anything like that, but you&#39;ll find yourself getting more easily fatigued if you&#39;re not careful. Thankfully you&#39;ve got the all inclusive pass, so three meals a day and two room service mini-meals are included, though gratuities aren&#39;t.”<br />
<br />
Gloria grinned. “Yeah, I made sure not to spare any expense on this trip. I figured if I was going to indulge myself, I may as well make sure that all my appetites were handled.” She smiled again, this time a smirk that made sure Amy knew that &#39;appetites&#39; held multiple meanings.<br />
<br />
Amy grinned in response and toyed with her hair nervously again. Was she attracted, or was it the uncomfortable awkwardness of a resort employee who&#39;d been told not to discourage guests&#39; flirtation? Was she seeing a tacit admission of curiosity, or the experienced recognition of someone attracted to her? It was so hard for Gloria to tell on a normal day, let alone while she was still processing both the incredible experience she just had and the ones she potentially COULD have.<br />
<br />
“Now,” Amy said, regaining her composure, “As far as our night life, we&#39;ve got the standard stuff that you&#39;d expect at any resort-we&#39;ve got a stretch of beach, as well as a forest. A lot of predator shifters love the forest. Both of those are very couple-centric though, and...I remember you checking in alone.” Again, Amy got a little flustered. “Not..not that you couldn&#39;t meet someone here..or haven&#39;t already..or..”<br />
<br />
Again, Gloria reached her hand over the counter to reassuringly touch Amy&#39;s. Again, the girl seemed to calm right down. “I understand what you meant, Amy. You simply meant that most single folks don&#39;t seem to enjoy those places as much, right?”<br />
<br />
Amy gave her a grateful look. “Yes.” Amy sighed and buried her face in her hands for a moment. “I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just..tripping over my words today.” She smoothed her hair as she exhaled a long sigh and composed herself.<br />
<br />
“While there&#39;s plenty of other standard stuff you could do, like use our gym, get a massage, et cetera, there&#39;s three hot spots for the night life here for predators. Two of them are hook-up type places. There&#39;s &#39;Bitches&#39;, which is our gay and lesbian club that caters primarily to canine and wolf shifters, though anyone&#39;s welcome there, obviously. There&#39;s &#39;The Jungle&#39;, which is a more conventional night club/singles bar type place. We obviously wouldn&#39;t want to call it a &#39;straight club&#39;, but if you&#39;re looking for a hook up that&#39;s a little more hetero, that&#39;s probably your best option, though it&#39;s hardly difficult to find a fling anywhere in the resort. Then there&#39;s our newest place, called &#39;Changes&#39;. It&#39;s a new concept place we started about two months ago. It&#39;s for people who like watching other people change.”<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s interest was piqued. “Oh?” she asked, trying not to betray just how interested or how aroused the concept got her.<br />
<br />
Amy nodded. “To get in, you have to grant the club permission to have control over your nanites-they don&#39;t change anything about what you turn into-but they can trigger it on and off. The logic is that if you&#39;re going to watch others change, you have to be willing to let them watch you. Everything&#39;s set on a randomizer, so it&#39;s not like anyone is specifically targeted above and beyond anyone else-BUT, there&#39;s also an extra trigger. If you&#39;re touched by someone who&#39;s already shifted or shifting, you shift too.”<br />
<br />
“That seems interesting, though a little odd,” Gloria said. <br />
<br />
“We did it because there were some...incidents...when we first opened it. Because it was random, it was pretty often that a husband or boyfriend would shift without their wife or girlfriend shifting as well. Sometimes someone else would get a little..touchy feely...and the other half of the couple would get pretty defensive and fights had a potential to break out. We&#39;re about making fantasies come true, not breaking up couples. So now it&#39;s simply a matter of a partner making sure to touch their other half, and they&#39;re shifting together, and it becomes obvious. Nobody gets in trouble unknowingly.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded. “Ah, I see. That actually does make a lot of sense.”<br />
<br />
“Now people almost make a game of it, trying to be the last one changed in the club, or trying to ensure they&#39;ve caused the most people to be changed. So much so that we&#39;ve started keeping score, which is simple, thanks to the nanites. They actually expanded the club itself, so there&#39;s hiding spots and chasing spots, etc. Things still get pretty out of hand there, but now it&#39;s in all the right ways, if you know what I mean,” Amy said, and her eyes twinkled a bit as a playful smile crossed her face.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve been there before, I presume?” Gloria asked, noticing that smile. It definitely seemed like a flirt.<br />
<br />
 Amy nodded. “Yeah. It&#39;s probably our most unique attraction here, though it runs on very strict hours. While Bitches opens at around 2PM, and The Jungle opens at noon, Changes runs strictly from dusk til dawn, so there&#39;s still..what..I think sunset is at eight-ish tonight, which means it&#39;ll open its doors at around 7:30.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” said Gloria. “You&#39;ve been a great help. I think I&#39;ll..”</p>
