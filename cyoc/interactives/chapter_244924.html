<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty thanked June, and went to his room. He was glad to have seen Lisa, but sorry to not have been able to spend any time with her. Despite having told her, &quot;it won&#39;t be much longer,&quot; it seemed like it was going to be forever.<br />
<br />
He tried to read more to distract himself, but he just couldn&#39;t stay focused on the book. His mind didn&#39;t want to think about anything but Lisa. He looked over to the portal door between their bedrooms. It would be so easy to open that door...<br />
<br />
But no, he had promised Diego and Maria that he would honor the grounding they imposed, for his having harmed Lisa. They didn&#39;t know just exactly _how_ he had harmed Lisa, because neither he nor Lisa were willing to explain that he had turned Lisa into four billion little pieces, one in every man in the world&#39;s cock. Including Diego&#39;s cock, he now thought in horror. And Mark&#39;s. And Dustin&#39;s. He felt like he was going to be ill. He&#39;d thought it was a bad idea from the outset, but Lisa had been insistent. He hadn&#39;t really thought it through, and his new realization made him feel worse. Diego was right in his assessment that Ty had acted with gross negligence. The fact that Lisa had asked for the transformation didn&#39;t mitigate that at all. It was his power, so it was his responsibility.<br />
<br />
And then, to fix it, he&#39;d had to make four billion copies of himself, and transform them into all of those men&#39;s cocks. Including Diego&#39;s, Mark&#39;s and Dustin&#39;s. Now he felt like he was going to throw up. But it had been necessary, to undo the damage that the transformation to Lisa had done. To retrieve her four billion pieces. At least he had only been in each man&#39;s cock momentarily. Because of her own request, each fragment of her had been in some man&#39;s cock for an hour!<br />
<br />
He grabbed the small wastebasket by his desk, but he didn&#39;t actually throw up. He still felt pretty ill, though. He set the wastebasket back down.<br />
<br />
And the worst part of all that was that after Lisa had pressured him to do it, she hadn&#39;t even gotten the enjoyment she had expected from it. She said she felt something was wrong almost immediately, but she was helpless to do anything about it. She&#39;d wanted him to stop, but she hadn&#39;t been able to actually tell him anything. She&#39;d had to endure an hour of being shredded into four billion tiny pieces because of that. And then the time that it took him to gather her pieces, and figure out how to reassemble her.<br />
<br />
Apparently Lisa, as s single conscious entity, could be subdivided into some number of physically separate pieces without it being a problem. At least four, from her experience as his four cocks, which she enjoyed greatly. Which was what had made her want to be ALL of the cocks. But there must be a threshold somewhere between four and four billion, where it became a problem. Maybe at some point her pieces were too tiny. He was afraid to experiment on her to find out.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when he had made multiple distinct but complete copies of her, originally inadvertently when she&#39;d been his cock, and he&#39;d duplicated it (and her), that hadn&#39;t hurt her at all. He didn&#39;t know if there was any limit on how many copies would be viable, but in order to gather her four billion pieces back, he&#39;d made four billion copies of himself, and it hadn&#39;t had any harmful effect on him.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if they experimented with any new, extreme transformations in the future, Ty would have to design the transformation to ensure that Lisa could communicate with him, in whatever form she had, in case there was a problem. He didn&#39;t like that she&#39;d had to wait an hour before he even knew that she needed to be rescued.<br />
<br />
That decided, Ty tried to focus his thoughts on the good times that he and Lisa had had. Most of the transformations he&#39;d done to her hadn&#39;t caused problems, and were a lot of fun. Even when they weren&#39;t actively engaged in transformation-related kinky sex, some of her alternate forms were really nice. He enjoyed sleeping on her mattress-topper-and-pillows form, and also had enjoyed it when she had slept on him in that form.<br />
<br />
Since he couldn&#39;t see her now, maybe he should take this time to experiment with transformations on his own. Of course, he&#39;d have to avoid doing anything dangerous, because she wasn&#39;t here to transform him back if there was a problem. So maybe he should stick to transformations they&#39;d already done.<br />
<br />
And he now knew that he could make multiple copies of himself. He&#39;d only done it in cock form, but there was no reason he couldn&#39;t do it right now, as a full human. He&#39;d barely made the thought, when a copy of himself appeared. He looked at himself, then at his bed. He shoved the pillows off his bed, and transformed into the mattress-topper and pillows form. As he expected, he felt himself lie down upon himself. It felt nice. He&#39;d designed the mattress-topper-and-pillows form so that in addition to experiencing its own pleasure, at any pressure upon its surface, such as a person lying on it, or squeezing it, that it would also experience any sexual arousal and pleasure of anyone atop it, including their orgasms. Right now, just feeling his other body lying on his surface felt great. But then he thought how much more he&#39;d be enjoying it if it was Lisa atop him, rather than himself.<br />
<br />
His human body must have drifted off to sleep, as he felt the body lying on his surface become more still, and breathing more slowly. He drifted off to sleep too.<br />
<br />
Some time later he felt his human body doing something to him. He was rubbing his fur, near his center. Oh, he thought, we want to fuck. In basic mattress-topper form, he had no genitals. No human organs of any kind, really. But he could manifest whatever organs he wanted. (And he&#39;d given Lisa that ability, when she was in that form.) He assumed that his human body still had a cock, or maybe several, so he manifested two copies of Lisa&#39;s pussy. That must have been what he wanted, because he felt two cocks being shoved into them.<br />
<br />
He gave himself a thorough, and quite enjoyable fucking. He both came. As the mattress-topper, he felt both his mattress stimulation from the pressure on his surface, and the orgasm from his pussies, and the orgasm from his human form, atop himself. He felt himself roll over, grabbing one of his pillows (which were actually his breasts, well, his copies of Lisa&#39;s breasts, transformed into pillows), and go back to sleep. He shrank his pussies away, and thought to himself, that was quite nice. Too bad it wasn&#39;t Lisa. It was just himself, just masturbation. Despite the afterglow, that left him disappointed. While his human body apparently had no trouble getting back to sleep, his mattress-topper form was not so lucky. He thought, how am I going to endure five more days without Lisa?</p>
