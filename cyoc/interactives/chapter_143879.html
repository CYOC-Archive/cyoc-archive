<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Camille followed the crow&#39;s flight from the ground, the bird patiently circling and waiting for her to catch up, before finally being lead from the valley into a group of trees against a far eastern path. There, the mother crow perched next to a nest where the high pitched chirping of young birds could be heard.<br />
<br />
The crow stared at her nest nervously and then back at Camille below. The deer looked at the tree and found she could climb it enough with her tall height to reach the higher branches. She carefully did so, snagging her red cloak once, and stood almost sixteen feet off the ground to become eye level with the bird nest.<br />
<br />
There, chirping and falling over one another, were three fluffy young crows. All perfectly black and healthy, the trio chirped and squeaked at the sight of their mother and the ppromise of food.<br />
<br />
The crow looked at Camille expectantly and seemed to be very concerned. &quot;Not hurt babies?&quot; She cawed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you have my word.&quot; Camille said solemnly. She looked to the babies, held her hand over the nest, and watched as her gold misty magic went to work. Like the mother, the three babies began to grow intelligent, only slightly pained by the process, as Camille had willed it to negate as much as she could. When she finished, the three children stared at each other, their mom, the deer, and seemed to be taking the world in.<br />
<br />
The largest hatchling chirped excitedly, and the mother chirped back. The other two began to hop up and down excitedly and soon all four birds were busily chattering and squawking. No doubt the mother was explaining something in bird speak. Camille couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the patient gesturing of the mother crow. She was clearly a mom.<br />
<br />
The mother crow turned back to the deer and bowed in an emotional gesture of thanks, swooping her wings. &quot;Thank you, friend Camille!&quot; There was almost an edge of relief to her voice. She turned back to her nest and cawed something Camille couldn&#39;t pretend to understand.<br />
<br />
Very sweetly, all three hatchlings rose in unison with adorable high pitched voices. &quot;Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh!&quot; Camille touched her heart. &quot;You&#39;re welcome, my loves!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the oldest!&quot; The largest child crow said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not!&quot; Another said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the girl!&quot; The smallest trilled. All three began to laugh and wrestle against each other.<br />
<br />
The mother cawed and ruffled her feathers in mock bewilderment. &quot;Intelligence comes later?&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille joined the mother laughing at her wit and Camille began to climb down the tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find mate?&quot; The mother asked politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course!&quot; Camille nodded. &quot;Of course! You lead, I&#39;ll follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; The mother nodded, pausing to regurgitate some food for her kids, which Camille turned away from just in time, her stomach turning at the idea.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
It was starting to get late. The sun was setting and the sky was turning pink. Amidst the far end of the valley, with only sparse pine trees against a rocky wall, the mother crow lead Camille to her mate. A marginally larger crow hopped on the ground below looking for grubs hidden under fallen pine needles. The mother flew down and perched on Camille&#39;s shoulder, pointing her wing gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see him.&quot; Camille smiled. She waved her hand, concentrated, and at range her misty powers enveloped the male crow. He reacted much as the mother had, straining, tensing, growing smarter.<br />
<br />
When it was done, Camille bent down gently several feet away and watched as the mother crow flew to her mate. The two exchanged glances, squawking, and finally tenderness. They threw their wings around each other and embraced, nuzzling each other&#39;s faces and almost crying. After another tirade of cawing and harsh squawks, they both returned to Camille and one each landed on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello, sir!&quot; Camille smiled, regarding the new male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am.&quot; The male bowed softly. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille took the male&#39;s extended foot in her finger and gently shook. All three chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; The mother crow blinked several times. &quot;Is getting dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Camille considered. &quot;You know, I was wondering if you two fine fliers might entertain an idea I had.&quot;<br />
<br />
They began to head back, the crows remaining on Camille&#39;s shoulders as she began to walk back to her &quot;throne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak, we listen.&quot; The male said agreeably. The female nodded her agreement gently, cawing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, pretty soon we&#39;re going to build this place into a new world. You, I, your kids, they&#39;re going to be the new citizens.&quot; Camille began. The crows exchanged excited looks with each other and then turned back to the deer. &quot;I&#39;m going to need an air force, aren&#39;t I? I&#39;ll definitely have use for talented scouts. Our country will need those who can fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male proudly puffed out his chest feathers and saluted one wing. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot;<br />
<br />
The female crow shook her head and cawed derisively at her mate&#39;s cheesy display of newfound patriotism. &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So. Here&#39;s where it gets interesting.&quot; Camille paused and sat against the dusty wall of the valley, the night closing in and shadows dancing across the blue landscape. The crows dropped from her shoulder onto the ground below, staring up at her curiously. &quot;Do you want to stay as you are? Or would you like a form like mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two birds went wide eyed and looked to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;One moment. We talk.&quot; The male held out his wing feathers to approximate the gesture of holding up one&#39;s finger. The two crows began a tirade of cawing, chittering, and squawking that Camille could never hope to understand. She wondered absently if she could simply make herself understand bird speak. Could she do that? For the moment, it felt like an invasion of privacy.<br />
<br />
The birds nodded gently to each other and the female elected to speak, cocking her head to the side. &quot;Camille means form like man? Bird... man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Camille nodded gently.<br />
<br />
The crows exchanged another look, almost like nervous shock, and seemed oddly unsettled.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Was Camille just deer?&quot; The male asked, blinking. &quot;Camille was not human body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; The deer whispered, the night settling in. &quot;My king, uh, my mate, I guess. Well, he gave me the gift of my mind. Like I did for you. Then, he gave me this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male ruffled his feathers slightly and blinked again. &quot;We... increase? Bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
The female looked at her wings and held them out. &quot;Hands to grip?&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille gulped excitedly as the birds considered changing. &quot;Yes, I can do whatever you can imagine. I can grant you bodies tailored to your desires. Change you however you desire. Change you to whatever size you please. Make your stronger fliers, make you more resiliant, stronger, faster. I can do it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female looked up to the deer in astonishment and seemed to be in awe. &quot;Camille... is... God?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly not!&quot; The deer moved to kneel before the birds and laid in front of them. &quot;But I can change anything in this forest. Including you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crows exchanged another glance and cawed once or twice between each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... change hurt?&quot; The male bowed submissively. &quot;Don&#39;t want hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The deer smirked slightly and chuckled. &quot;Quite the opposite, my loves.&quot; She grinned deviously. &quot;If you so wish, I can bring you physical pleasure that you can&#39;t even dream of. Our animal sexualities limit us, but I can bring you to the height of orgasmic delight and beyond. Imagine the sensation of your very flesh tugging and pulling. Your bones stretching. Your lean muscle expanding under your skin. Prickles and waves of erotic bliss. Imagine what must happen to your most sensitive parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made the female almost look away in embarassment. The male, however, seemed curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do this?&quot; The male considered. &quot;Truly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to find out?&quot; Camille pulled her legs back into the air and began to sway them playfully, her tail flagging. &quot;How about a little taste, my friends? Let me change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female looked back to the deer and seemed to be trembling with either fear or nervousness. It was hard to tell which. &quot;Anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot; Camille repeated in reassurance, staring at the two birds in the young night with fireflies dancing in a field far away and crickets chirping around them. It was magical. &quot;And no judgement. Only my joy at letting you use my ability as you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, the crows squawked to each other. The male stepped forward, clearly intriqued, and stared up at the doe queen with steady blue eyes, sparkling with wonder. &quot;Can... Camille make me little more human? Slow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can.&quot; The deer smiled eagerly. She gently reached forward and touched the male crow, her palm momentarily shimmering with gold energy that transferred to him.<br />
<br />
The male staggered back from the deer and gasped sharply, letting out a sharp caw. He closed his eyes, lost in feelings and sensations he truly couldn&#39;t have imagined before, and delicious warmth began to spread from inside of him to cover his body in a blanket of tingling erotic bliss. He couldn&#39;t help himself, he came right then and there from just that stimulation, his cloaca releasing a stream of white pearly fluid onto the grass below him, his taloned feet clenching into the ground and pulling up dirt. He cawed softly, pulled his head toward his chest, and spread his wings out, trembling.<br />
<br />
The female watched this display with apparent shock and delight. No doubt she was trying to comprehend how good it would feel for her.<br />
<br />
The male suddenly gasped, the pleasure reaching peaks that kept climbing higher, and he uncontrollably released a second squirt that splattered against his fine black feathers and thighs, as he ruffled, he began to breathe heavily, and started to stretch.<br />
<br />
At first, it looked as if he was simply standing up taller, but in his weak and trembling state it became obvious that he was actually beggining to grow in size. Camille watched in her own delight along with the female crow, as the male slowly and carefully expanded. Little by little, millimeters at a time, in warm gentle spurts. Not just larger, he was adjusting at the same time. His upside down teardrop shaped body began to change. He began to pull more upright. His legs grew longer and thicker. His feet grew bigger. He stepped on them gently, adjusting as he changed, spreading out further from his growth.<br />
<br />
The female watched this in total fascination, her long beak falling agape, her eyes widening. Her mate grew to twice her size, standing more upright. Digits emerged from midway down his wing, three clawed fingers covered with soft black down. His pelvis had pulled in closer between his legs, forming a bump between them. The two other animals watched this development with awe and suddenly a bright red bump inverted from the hole where his sex organs would have normally been, plumping and lengthening into a swollen nub housed in tje sheath behind. A bulge behind the new penis presented itself and swelled into the clear outline of testicles housed behind the sheath. The bird fell forward onto his new proto hands, and cawed as his bulge pressed further, stretching to a fine tapering point from the fat nub it had been moments before. It strained and throbbed intensely, the shaft visibly straining. The male groaned as his leg joints snapped forward, penis growing longer and thinner, balls growing more pronounced, thighs pulling forward and legs pulling back, until he was resting on knobby knees. His neck lengthened just a little, pulling his head up, and he opened his eyes gasping as it began to relent.<br />
<br />
The female stared at her mate and called to him gently, trilling. He responded with a slight smile at the corners of his still hard beak, and nodded with a huge grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Theeere.&quot; Camille smiled.<br />
<br />
The male nodded his beak towards his new penis and his female mate stared at it lustfully and then back to him. She gently stepped forward, stared at the deer, and the two females understood each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want some privacy?&quot; Camille whispered.<br />
<br />
The female crow shook her head no and seemed to almost blush through her jet black feathers in the dark of the valley. &quot;Camille... stays?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be happy to.&quot; The deer grinned.</p>
