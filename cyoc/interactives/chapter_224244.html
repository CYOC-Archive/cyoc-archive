<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;.....No, wait!  I&#39;d like for you to decide for me, Madame.&quot;, replied James.  &quot;Well, I can&#39;t have you having an IQ of zero, so I think you should be perceived by everyone as having an IQ of three or about as smart as your average six month old.&quot; said Madame.  Madame then, with a swish of her hand, conjured up a wheelchair on stage for James to sit in.  &quot;James, will you please sit in that wheelchair so that we can begin your perceived transformation?&quot;, asked Madame.  James walked over to the wheelchair apprehensively, but also happy to be rid of his old life, and then sat down in it.  &quot;Now that you&#39;re seated, James, we can let the fun begin!&quot; declared Madame.  Once Madame&#39;s words were spoken, James began to feel his clothes shift and change.  His shoes simply disappeared as his socks turned green and developed anti-skid soles.  Next he felt his bluejeans and shirt fuse together and turn into a green jump suit with durable material that can&#39;t be torn.  The arms of his garment lengthened to cover his hands as thick padded mittens while every button on the front of his garment disappeared.  Then he watched a zipper form on the inseam of his jumpsuit leg, starting at the cuff, and go up and around the crotch and down to the cuff of the other  leg.  Afterward, he felt another zipper start at waist level on his back and work it&#39;s way up to his collar.  He then noticed that a thick and strong strip of velcro was forming over the zipper of the jumpsuit&#39;s inseam.  He then felt velcro grow up to cover the zipper on his back.  Unbeknownst to James, magnetic locks were forming on both zippers where they closed so that only his care takers can unlock the garment and take it off of him.  James then felt that his underwear was growing softer and thicker as it turned into a thick green institutional cloth diaper.  James, leaning back into his chair, poked at his diaper through his jumper with his mittened hand.  As he pressed against his crotch, he heard a crinkle verifying that his diaper has a thick vinyl barrier.  &quot;James, are you pleased so far?&quot; asked Madame.  James looked up at madame and simply nodded his head.  &quot;Good, let&#39;s continue with the fun!&quot; clapped Madame.  Next, James felt a thick foam helmet with a shell and strap form around his head.  &quot;James, look down.&quot; said Madame.  James looked down and watched as his wheelchair foot rests merged into a single foot board that had built in sandals that wrapped  around his feet with straps that held them in place.  Next, he noticed ankle straps forming around his ankles to keep them in place.  Next he watched as leg straps formed around his legs to keep those secure.  Then, he watched as knee bumpers formed on the outside of his legs preventing his knees from moving too far out.  James continued looking in awe as a padded abductor formed in the front of his wheelchair seat further limiting his ability to move as it prevented him from moving his thighs close together and preventing him from scooting closer to the front of  his wheelchair.  He watched as a butterfly harness formed across his chest and shoulders keeping him in place.  James realized that even without his mittens, he wouldn&#39;t be able to undo the straps because they were secured behind him and required a special key to unlock.    A tray formed over his arm wrests which caused James to raise up his hands, but then he lowered them again and rested them on the tray.  Lateral supports then formed to keep James from moving his trunk too much.  To complete the wheelchair, a winged head rest poofed into place giving James a place to rest his head.  Last, but not least, a long green terry bib with vinyl backing formed around James&#39; neck.  &quot;Well, James, we&#39;re finished with your transformation on stage, but we still need to form your new reality of everyone thinking you have an IQ of three as well as setting up your new living situation.&quot; said Madame.  James then watched as Madame formed a cloud that let him see into an empty room.  The walls, floor, and ceiling were all white.  In the corner, a camera was watching all the happenings going on in that room.  The door looked like it was made of steel and it had a window in it with thick glass.  It had a door knob, but above that was a card swipe and a keypad.  &quot;Now watch, James!&quot;, said Madame.  James continued to watch the cloud.  An adult sized institutional metal crib formed in one corner.  It was painted white, but the mattress, green in color, was bare.  James noticed that the mattress was covered in vinyl.  He then watched as a white sheet covered his mattress.  He then noticed that the sheet completely encased the mattress and had a zipper with a magnetic lock closing the sheet around the mattress on the underside.  He then watched as a cage top formed over the top of the crib.  Afterwards, he watched crib bumpers covered in white vinyl form along the inside of his crib bars.  After the crib, he watched an institutional changing table form with its cabinet doors open.  He watched as it stocked itself with spare institutional diapers, wipes, bibs, jumpers, shampoo, and body wash.  After everything was stocked, the cabinets closed and locked themselves.  Madame then walked up to James, grabbed his face, and removed his dentures leaving him toothless.  James was shocked!  He didn&#39;t realize his teeth had been turned to dentures.  &quot;You don&#39;t need these in your new reality, you&#39;re going to be spoon fed soft mushy room temperature food while your juice and milk will be fed to you in a bottle with nipple.&quot;, said Madame.  &quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about changing your clothes, changing your diaper, using the toilet, feeding yourself, or even bathing and entertaining yourself.  Someone else will be there to do all that for you!  During the day, a caretaker will place various toys on your wheelchair tray for you to play with.  You&#39;ll get to choose from soft foam blocks, perhaps a soft foam ball.  Maybe you&#39;ll get fun squeaky animals to play with.  Perhaps, you&#39;ll get a teething toy.  What ever you get to play with, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it.  As for your background story, you are perceived as being aggressive, that&#39;s why there are straps to tie you down in your crib if you need it.  That&#39;s also why you&#39;re wearing mitts and protective head gear.  You&#39;re wearing a bib because you are perceived as having a major drooling problem, but you can expect to keep it on during your meals as well.  You are also perceived as having involuntary muscle movement which is why you have all of the attachments on your wheelchair.  Of course, if you think this new life as a fully mentally functioning adult in a mental health institution may potentially be boring, I can always reduce your IQ down to three so that you wouldn&#39;t have to be bored.  Either way, a mental health nurse is going to walk out of that cloud and collect you.  When you both pass into the cloud again, you&#39;ll be in the mental hospital where you&#39;ll spend the rest of your days inside that single room except when it&#39;s time for you to be wheeled out for you to be bathed.  So, tell me, do you want me to take away your intelligence?&quot; asked Madame.</p>
