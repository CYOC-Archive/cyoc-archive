<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was walking along wondering if he would be running into any of the superheroes he's heard about. Unlike his coworkers he felt the should be left alone and not be forced to reveal their true identities. Sure some did reveal their true identities but they were the ones that didn't have any family usually. If a superhero were to tell him their true identity he would keep it a secret. He was confident that he could even under torture. He never thought that he might need to protect his secret identity.<br />
<br />
As he passed an alley he heard something. Looking he saw someone that appeared to be hurt. He wasn't going to ignore someone who might need help so he ran up to them asking, &quot;Are you alright? Do you need any help?&quot;<br />
<br />
When they looked up Rick could see that it was Shama. She had been around for a long time. She had done an interview a month ago and she had said she was over two hundred years old. She hadn't looked this old though during the interview. Her fur was white now where just a month ago it had been jet black. Her breathing was ragged and her eyes had a film over them. She smiled at him and said, &quot;I'm dying young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I can do for you Shama?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is. I need to pass on my power to someone who has a kind heart and will use the power I give them for good. I believe you to be that person. But you must head my warning. My nemesis Black Light will come after you. He had me but I managed to escape. I didn't get away without injury however and the years are rapidly catching up to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sword that pierced my side undid the magic that kept me from aging. Don't worry though. Once I pass my power on to you the magic will be rewoven. Do you accept my power?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick didn't take long to think it over. He would be able to help a superhero in her last moments and he'd be able to make sure that her mission to battle evil forces and help those that needed it would continue. &quot;I accept,&quot; he said with a nod.<br />
<br />
Shama placed her hand/paw on his face and said, &quot;I'm glad you accepted. The power will be different for you than it was for me. That's the way it is but you'll be a wolf. There may be one part that you won't like but it can't be helped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; you asked noticing that she was getting weaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll... you'll...&quot; Shama started to say but didn't finish. Her eyes closed and she stopped breathing. A golden glow surrounded her and it spread to Rick. He felt a shock and then the glow faded. All that was left was a necklace with a stylized heart on it. Picking it up Rick walked home to his apartment wondering what Shama was going to say. He guessed he'd find out soon enough.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Later that night Rick had gone to bed nude. He hadn't done that before. The only thing he wore was the necklace. As he slept a change came over him. Strawberry blonde fur sprouted all over his body. His hands became more like paws with his fingernails becoming black claws. His feet lengthened and his toenails became claws. His face pushed out into a muzzle while his teeth became sharp wolf teeth. His ears became triangular and migrated to the top of his head. His muscles rearranged becoming stronger while not adding much bulk. A tail grew out of his spine. Then the part that Shama said he might not like happened. His dick shrank while his balls pulled inside him. They rearranged giving him female genitals. Then his chest started to expand. Breasts grew on his chest stopping at a DDD cup. Finally his hips widened and his waist narrowed as did his shoulders.<br />
<br />
His transformation finished he opened his eyes. His skin felt like it was crackling with energy. It was then that he noticed the weight on his chest. Looking down he was shocked to find he now had breasts. Thinking about what Shama had said about him possibly not liking a part of this he moved his hand down to his groin to check the equipment. What he found only confirmed that he was now she. “Maybe I’ll be male again when I change back,” she said noticing her feminine voice. “But how do I change back?”<br />
<br />
Not having any idea how to change back yet she opted to go into the bathroom and look at her new body. She found that she was standing on the balls of her feet and this with her longer feet added to her height. Her ears were brushing the ceiling and she had to duck to get through the bathroom door. As she entered she automatically reached for the light to turn it on. However when she flipped the switch the light didn’t come one. In fact the night light she had in there also went out. “Must have tripped the breaker,” she muttered to herself. At least she was able to see almost as well as with the light on. Looking into the mirror she saw that her eyes had become golden wolf eyes. She took in her fur and figure. “Well at least I’m good looking,” she said admiring herself. “If I have to stay this way at least I’m not ugly. I guess I should have a new name. But what should it be?” After a moment’s consideration a name popped into her head and she smiled. “That sounds good,” she said. “From now on I am Lightning Wolf. Can I change back into a human though?”<br />
<br />
A voice entered her head then saying, ~To return to a human form you just have to think “I am human” and you will be. To become what you are now just think “I am lycan” and you will be.~<br />
<br />
The voice didn’t say anymore but she could still feel it in her head. Shrugging she decided to try what the voice said. She had nothing to lose after all. ‘I am human,’ she thought and she could feel the changes beginning. Her fur receded into her body except for that on top of her head which grew longer. Her feet shrank and she was no longer standing on the balls of her feet. Her paw-hands returned to being regular hands. Her tail shrank back into her spine. Her muzzle shrank down into a human face while her ears migrated down and rounded becoming human again. Her eyes went from the golden wolf eyes to her normal hazel human eyes. Her hair changed color back to her dark brown color. Her breasts shrank down though instead of the flat chest she had been expecting little breast buds remained. All during this she had been shrinking until she was finally four foot two. She expected the transformation to continue until she was male again but that didn’t happen. Instead the necklace she had worn to bed popped into place around her neck resized to fit her. She hadn’t even noticed that it was gone.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t see in the bathroom now so she went back to her bedroom to look at herself. She felt her hair tickling her back and figured that it was about to her mid-back. She turned on the light thankful that the breaker didn’t trip and looked at herself. She guessed that she was about eight or nine or maybe ten. Her human form was that of a little girl. She wouldn’t be male again it seemed. She looked around and shook her head. “Ok,” she said to herself. “Try to think about this logically. I’m a girl now and my human form is about nine. My lycan form is probably an adult around twenty-one I think. I have no clothes that will fit me in either form. I could try to go buy some clothes in my lycan form for both of my forms but I have no idea on what sizes I would need. What am I going to do?”<br />
<br />
~Find me,~ the voice said in her head. ~Find me and you will learn how to use your power. Find me and you will find a safe place. Find me and you will find some clothes for you. Leave your old life behind and find me.~<br />
<br />
The voice went silent but didn’t leave. She shrugged and turned off the light before opening the window. “I’ll need a new name,” she said to herself. “I’ve always liked the name Elizabeth so that will be my new name. I am Elizabeth.” With that she reluctantly accepted the fact that she was a girl now. She looked out at the stars and thought, ‘I am lycan.’ The change happened faster this time and her necklace popped out of existence.<br />
<br />
When her change was done she took a deep breath and squeezed through the window. Once outside she leaped into the air and was surprised that she didn’t fall. Instead she was flying. She felt exhilarated that she was actually flying on her own power. Then it stopped and she crashed to the ground. Getting up she was a little sore but otherwise unharmed. Shrugging she decided to run and when she did she was like lightning she was running so fast. She also noticed that she had shifted onto all fours to run. This was exhilarating and she couldn’t wait to learn how to fly properly. She picked a direction and followed it wondering if the voice would be at the end of it.</p>
