<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There’s something different about Lily as her back was turned and she held her clothes in her arms. Her form seemed less feminine, narrow hips, broad shoulders, and a bit of muscle. As weird as it was you could tell it was her through scent if nothing much else as she held her clothes sat beside her and she seemingly was struggling to get her top to fit.<br />
<br />
You approached Lily and reached out to get her attention and muttered,&quot;...uh... Lily...?&quot;<br />
<br />
But the moment your palm touched her shoulder Lily spun around and screamed,&quot;Gaaah!&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s when you noticed exactly what had happened to her, and it was rather obvious now that you got a frontal view of things. Lily was hardly feminine at all, in fact she wasn’t female at all. Her chest was flat with a hint of muscle, her complexion was all except female, her voice was clearly masculine like a young adult man, and finally the elephant in the room was the seven inches of sheath and golf ball sized furry testicles between her, or shall we say his legs, although there was an effeminate look to his body.<br />
<br />
You blushed upon seeing this, and for a moment you thought you had found someone completely different. However his eyes were the exact same color as hers, so this absolutely had to be Lily. &quot;I-I... y-you uh....&quot; You muttered with a bright red blush beneath your dark fur as you took a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey, don’t...!&quot; Lily growled with the fur on the back of his neck standing on end, but then a moment of realization came across his face and he trailed off,&quot;...s-startle... m-me...... oh my,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L-Lily...?&quot; You asked again and a blush came across this reynard&#39;s face as he slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Are you the g-guy I met before...?&quot; He whimpered and you nodded and his blush grew deeper,&quot;I-I Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay, lets both just take a few breaths and get a hold of ourselves now.&quot; You said holding up your hands and making a gesture for Lily to calm down.<br />
<br />
Lily took a deep breath and nodded, his tail between his legs and his cheeks losing most of their blush as he sighed and explained,&quot;Okay, d-don’t judge but... I was just curious okay? I-I wasn’t thinking things through completely and... well do you have anything that could fit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily came up to your neck in height, and his form would definitely make it difficult for him to fit into anything. But you had to admit to yourself that he... did look kind of cute. You weren’t quite sure if you were exactly gay or not, but then again you haven’t really been interested in any loving relationships as of late.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... might have some boxers, but... nothing in terms of pants that’d fit someone like you,&quot; You replied then Lily groaned,&quot;Oh, Damnit what am I going to do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked up and saw a couple, a horse and a zebra wearing absolutely nothing and walking around. You at first thought it was undesirable, but then thinking back you had no clue how they’d fit themselves into any sort of garment. You pointed up at them, and Lily looked over and blushed then you awkwardly scratched the back of your head and muttered,&quot;It’s uh... j-just as suggestion...&quot;<br />
<br />
With this, Lily sighed and took off his shirt and exposed his furry chest, and then he looked to your body and whined,&quot;This is embarrassing....&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave him a nervous smile and awkwardly chuckled,&quot;W-Well it’s at least y-you don’t have to worry about someone g-giving your nonexistent breasts a feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily looked back to see your face as you pathetically attempted to cheer him up and he sighed,&quot;I guess you’re right...&quot; Lily then looked down at his sheath and sighed,&quot;This thing feels so weird... how do you guys deal with your balls bouncing around all the time while you walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed as you looked down at his sheath, and admitted felt your own red rocket poking out of its sheathe and said,&quot;I-I uh... could say the same about women and breasts to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
With this Lily sighed,&quot;Fair enough,&quot; then he paused and whined, his ears lowered and he whined,&quot;God now I need a new name, and... I don’t know anything about being a guy and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could help!&quot; You blurted out then blushed and thought to yourself,&quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait, you... you would?&quot; Lily asked and you shook your head and focused back on the lithe looking fox and said,&quot;I-I mean... I’m normally a guy, and well... you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt like you’ve put yourself in an awkward situation, but then Lily rushed up to you and wrapped his arms around you tightly and barked,&quot;Oh thank you, thank you so so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your ears perked up and you looked around and saw that thankfully the transformation booths on the ship looked like they provided some privacy, and the equine couple left so you were alone, mostly though.<br />
<br />
You felt your red rocket burst to life in your pants and whined as you thought,&quot;Why now?&quot;<br />
<br />
However Lily didn’t seem to notice, in fact he paused and took a step back to see that his own cock was fully erect at an impressive eight and a half inches in full length. You blushed as you saw this, but felt a bit of comfort knowing you weren’t the only one who felt aroused at least slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey, does yours... usually do this, what does this mean?!&quot; He barked<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... yeah... trust me it’s fine just don’t worry about it for now, okay?&quot; You exclaimed and Lily nodded and sighed,&quot;Thank god!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then watched as Lily as he poked and took his knot into his hand briefly and stroked it some and moaned,&quot;God... so.... sensitive... mmmm, I can get why you men are so attached to these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just protect it... and your balls... that’s about the weakest part of our bodies, okay?&quot; You whimpered imagining the painful feeling of getting kicked in the balls.<br />
<br />
Lily nodded as he saw the pained look on your face as you thought then he hesitantly took your hand and asked,&quot;So... what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed as Lily held your hand and replied,&quot;I... well maybe first with the name,&quot; You looked down at Lily’s hand and continued blushing as you stared at it.<br />
<br />
Lily nodded to you and paused then asked,&quot;L-Leon... how about that?&quot; He then looked to your hands and asked,&quot;I-I uh... is this weird, for guys to hold hands?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I....&quot; You shook your head and said,&quot;No, it’s fine... really, actually I just realized that I’ve never told you my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah! What is it? I’ve been wondering myself,&quot; Leon barked and you saw his tail happily wagging, and that caused yours to start wagging too.<br />
<br />
You gave Leon a small smile and said,&quot;It’s Mark, and... heh, you look kind of nice as a reynard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I do?&quot; He asked looking at his body then he looked up and crossed his arms and replied,&quot;Well I think you look like a strong alpha male if I’ve ever seen one, a real handsome one at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh... thanks,&quot; You replied with a small blush,&quot;Would you uh... like to share a room at the resort when we get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’d love to,&quot; Leon replied and your blush grew several times deeper and you whimpered,&quot;U-Um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... uh, as guy friends of course... nothing too awkward, or.... well... right?&quot; Leon replied and you sighed,&quot;It’s fine, let’s just see how things go, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leon gave a small nod and the two of you started out when there was an announcement over the ship. &quot;Attention passengers, we have arrived at our destination. Be sure to check in at the front desk of the transformation booths those who have just transformed, and those who haven’t yet please do visit before disembarking. Here at the Pleasure Island Resort always be adventurous!&quot; A male voice, obviously being the captain said.<br />
<br />
You looked down at Leon and he gave you a small nod and said,&quot;Let’s go Marky, I wanna see how life being a guy is like once we get off!&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a small nod to Leon, but blushed and thought,&quot;M-Marky?!&quot; You wondered if Leon had caught on that he was aroused before, but that soon left as Leon took off running and you allowed yourself to get dragged along with him.<br />
<br />
You had your picture taken at the front desk of the transformation booths and Leon did too, you were given IDs that acted as room keys to the resort. As you left for the resort the snow leopard said,&quot;If you’d like to stay after the trial run of the place, we’d love to see you on the staff here boys!&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded, but didn’t think about it much at the time for Leon excitedly dragged you off to the grand resort. Once inside the lobby the two of you looked around in awe at how fancy everything looked at the resort. The two of you then looked at each other and collectively decided to go to...</p>
