<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Until the wee hours of the morning. Tired and exhausted the guys fell <br />
asleep in one anothers arms, blanketed with their hair.<br />
<br />
Shortly before 9 a.m. a loud banging at the Common room door aroused <br />
the guys from their sleep. One of the boys from the floor directly <br />
bellow popped his head in starteling the groggy guys. The new-comer <br />
was to their surprise just as shaggy as they. <br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't know if you'd heard. It's been all over the Televison since <br />
early last night. Seems everyone has gotten hairy. Kinda Cool, Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Did he hear right? Everyone? , thought Drake. Sam turned on the <br />
Television. There, on the screen, was an increadibly hairy news <br />
anchor.<br />
 <br />
&quot;This just in, The reports have been confermed. All mankind  has in <br />
fact grown miraculously hairy. No leads yet as to how or why this has <br />
happened. Stay tuned for further updates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don't that beat all&quot; said Sam turning off the T.V. &quot; I don't <br />
know about you guys but I could use something to eat right about now. <br />
Let's meet in the cafeteria for breakfast and then head on over to the <br />
gym for a game of B-ball and a swim.&quot; Sam Suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I go grab my trunks&quot; replied a tall blonde from atop the billiard <br />
table.<br />
<br />
&quot;What trunks? Look at youself. You don't need any any trunks.&quot; Sam <br />
laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I see it,&quot; continued Mike, &quot;clothing has become obsolete. There is <br />
no longer any need for any of us to hide our masculine good looks  <br />
under the constraints of sociatal attire. I'm not ashamed of my hair, <br />
no need for you to be either. Come on let's eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys made their way down to the cafeteria. Sure enough every male <br />
in the dorm had floor lenght manes, beards and body hair. Most went <br />
about au natural, a few dweebs still tried to cling to the old <br />
conventions of clothing. <br />
<br />
Mike and Drake sat down at a table with Sam and the other guys. They <br />
all tried to eat their breakfasts as usual but found it a tad <br />
difficult to eat with their long beards. Several boys, from the fourth <br />
floor, hinted  that napkins where of great help. The guys thanked them <br />
for the advise and continued with their breakfast. <br />
<br />
Ater a few minor messes the boys finished their meal and headed out to <br />
the lobby . Friendly hair banter and compliments flowed form one guy <br />
to the next.  Total strangers, guys form other floors and other dorms, <br />
were greeting one another with broad grins and and words of <br />
comradship. Everyone seemed totally happy with their hairy situation. <br />
Everyone that is excepy Drake.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason the total unity, the oneness, the lack unique <br />
diffrences, somewhat gnawed on his conscience.   <br />
<br />
 Mike tapped Drake on the shoulder. &quot;You comming, you studly wookie, <br />
you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, I wouldn't miss it&quot; Drake replied, trying to shrug off <br />
his feelings of concern.<br />
<br />
The gym was only a couple of blocks from the dorm and the guys decided <br />
to walk. Several guys decided to jog on over as they wanted to feel he <br />
wind rush through ther hair as they ran. &quot;We'll meet you on the court <br />
shortly.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Mike and Drake rounded the corner from the dorm to the main <br />
throughfare and suddenly stopped dead in their tracks. There on the <br />
other side of the street were four college girls, four very hairy <br />
college girls. <br />
<br />
Their head hair trailed ten feet along the ground behind them. Soft <br />
downy velus hairs eight to ten inches long covered their cheeks and <br />
chin forming a fuzzy sort of beard. Their torsos, breast, stomach <br />
shoulders, backs and buttox were similarly covered in downy fur <br />
measuring over a foot in length . Their arms, legs had courser hair <br />
some four feet in length and their arm pit hairs reached almost to the <br />
ground. Their pubic hairs cascaded to the grown like an old fashioned <br />
a-line skirt. <br />
<br />
The boys weren't exactly sure what to make of these hairy females. <br />
Part of them was repulsed and still another part of them was facinated <br />
and arroused. Could the pleasure of last night be duplicated with the <br />
members of the opposite sex? After all, being with the Guys last night <br />
had been the best experience of their lives. Something about all that <br />
hair was a total turn on. Could female hair be as errotic as male <br />
hair? Unfortunately there wasn't enough time to find out.<br />
<br />
A Meto bus pulled up, filled with hairy people of all ages. The girls <br />
boaredad the bus and were whisked away.  In the back of Drakes mind <br />
that nagging feeling once again came over him. Something wasn't quite <br />
right. Sure sex with a hairy girl would be worth trying but for now it <br />
would have to wait.<br />
<br />
The guys continued the last block in silence. When they reached their <br />
destination they were met by Sam who was waiting outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see those Girls? Damn they were hot&quot; said Sam. &quot;Wouldn't mind <br />
a little one on one with them.&quot; <br />
<br />
The guys entered the gym and headed for the locker room when it dawned <br />
on them they didn't have a change of clothes. &quot;Force of habbit&quot;, Sam <br />
laughed. &quot;Come on the guys are waiting for us on the court.&quot;<br />
.<br />
&quot;Who's shirts and Who's Skins&quot; joked the tall blond obviously no <br />
longer modest. <br />
<br />
The guys teamed up blondes and red heads vs brunettes. Dribbling <br />
running, jumping the boys played several games of b-ball. Sweat <br />
glistened and dripped from every hair on their bodies. After each game  <br />
they shook the sweat loose from their hair like human afgan hounds. <br />
<br />
After the game some decided to take a swim while others decide to work <br />
out at the weight center. Those who opted for swimming in the nude <br />
(can it still be caled skinny dipping?) found the sensation of their <br />
hair in the pool, floating, most exhillerating. For the others, <br />
including Mike and Drake, the sight of hugh muscle men covered in hair  <br />
working out with weights was something to behold. Both boys were <br />
mesmerized by the rippling of the hairs over the rippling muscles. <br />
Mike though &quot;If I only  had the lamp here I could be the world's <br />
hairiest Mr Universe.&quot; <br />
<br />
When the workout and swim were done, everyone congregated in the <br />
shower. There was a replay of yesterdays frolic which also included <br />
the muscle bound hunks. Clean, and invigorated the Mike and Drake <br />
headed back to the dorm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever think life could be this perfect?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
 Drake did not reply for a moment or two. Things obviously weren't so <br />
perfect, at least not for him. &quot;What's the good of being hairy if you <br />
don't stand out from the rest of the crowd?&quot;, he thought. He also <br />
wasn't sure about hairy wemen?  Also, The group thing with the guys <br />
was great, yesterday, but not so hot today. Wouldn't it be better if <br />
it was just him and Mike who were hairy?  Or better yet if it was just <br />
him?  &quot; If only I had the lamp,&quot; he thought, &quot;I'd make myself a super <br />
hairy, muscle bound, love god adored by all,&quot; he said aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? Oh no you don't. Not if I get to the lamp before you&quot;<br />
Mike remarked. With that both boys took off running  full speed. The <br />
race was on to</p>
