<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now in the Master category, give a big round of applause for Christopher, who managed to make his small-dick brother squirt his load in twenty nine seconds! That was twice as fast as any of the other small-dicks! And as per his wishes the award goes to his brother contestant number six.”<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered, “We did it bro!” Christopher exclaimed, ruffling my hair while while I was still leaning on the chair trying to catch my breath.<br />
<br />
“As for the penalty the competitor who dropped the first load was-”<br />
<br />
“Ehem,” the judge interrupted again. “I’d like to give everyone a quick reminder that the rules state it should be the ‘contestant on stage’ who ejaculates first receiving the penalty, regardless of whether he is competing in that particular category or not.”<br />
<br />
Wait that means…no...NO!<br />
<br />
“Oh, then it appears the penalty goes to… Daniel! Who couldn’t hold his cum in for even half a minute! And it will be dealt by... Christopher! Who managed to last through just over twenty minutes of vigorous mouth pounding! That’s twenty strikes from the paddle!”<br />
<br />
“Please Christopher,” I begged “go easy on me!”<br />
<br />
“I gotta make it look convincing” he said with a grin “Don’t worry it’ll be just like that time you spanked me when we were kids.”<br />
*SMACK*, “ONE!”,<br />
<br />
As the first painful strike landed I remembered the time my annoying little brother had climbed down from his bunk bed in the middle of the night and pissed right onto my sheets because he was too lazy to walk to the bathroom. Of course I’d had enough of him behaving like a little brat and decided to do what my dad was too soft to. I bent him over my knee and gave him a spanking.<br />
Oh god my I couldn’t believe that same person was now the one giving me a spanking live on stage!  <br />
*SMACK*, “TWO!”<br />
<br />
I remember his fat cock dangling between my legs and my jealousy taking over causing me to hit him as hard as I could.<br />
And his cock had only ever grown bigger over the years while mine stayed the same.<br />
*SMACK*, “THREE!”<br />
<br />
Even when I spanked Christopher as a boy he barely let out a peep.<br />
And here I was a grown man, whining like a little baby.<br />
*SMACK*, “FOUR!”<br />
<br />
Of course he went running to our uncle Chris who had a talk with my dad and convinced him that I needed to be disciplined in the same way as I had done to my brother. He took me out back to the shed and made me bend over the workbench and pull down the back of my pants. Thankfully I didn’t have to pull them all the way down or he would’ve seen my falsie.<br />
But now my falsie was missing, no where to be seen and my tiny dicklet was exposed for all the world to see.<br />
*SMACK*, “FIVE!”<br />
<br />
My uncle Chris paddled me six times hard, he had told me it wasn’t my place to decide how my brother was disciplined. My brother was there to watch. Dancing around with joy at my pain.<br />
Here on stage I could almost still hear the sounds of the paddle mixed with Christopher’s laughter.<br />
*SMACK*, “SIX!”<br />
<br />
When he was done, my uncle Chris asked Christopher if there was anything else he felt I should be punished for. He told him that he didn’t think I washed my penis well enough because I was always stinky. Falsies were a lot harder to clean back in the day. Uncle Chris gave me another three for being unhygienic.<br />
And here I was covered in semen, smelling like a used condom. Not much had changed.<br />
 *SMACK* *SMACK* *SMACK*, “SEVEN! EIGHT! NINE!”<br />
<br />
He told him that I was always hogging the bathroom. And even though my brother didn’t care if I brushed my teeth while he was using the toilet or showering, I’d always lock the door when I took showers and used the toilet so he couldn’t use the bathroom. Uncle Chris gave me another three for being selfish.<br />
I thought about all my brother has done and how generous he was in trying to help me win this competition. I should be more grateful<br />
 *SMACK* *SMACK* *SMACK*, “TEN! ELEVEN! TWELVE!”<br />
<br />
He also said my showers took way too long. He didn’t know at the time but it was because I was always jerking my little cock and sending my spermies down the drain. Of course it never took a long to finish but at that age I was doing it about five times every shower. Thinking about it made my dickie stiff even though I was being spanked. Uncle Chris gave me another three for being inconsiderate and wasting water.<br />
In the present the pain was getting to me, as tears rolled down my face and the humiliation set in I felt my little weenie ache as it grew hard as a pebble.<br />
 *SMACK* *SMACK* *SMACK*, “THIRTEEN! FOURTEEN! FIFTEEN!”<br />
<br />
Then finally he told our uncle that I was always wetting the bed. And about once a week he’d wake up early to watch cartoons and saw my sheets were all wet and sticky. That was when I realized he was talking about my wet dreams. But he said I was lying about him pissing in my bed and I must’ve wet it myself and tried to blame him. Our uncle smacked me another five times for telling lies.<br />
“I think little baby Daniel is enjoying this!” someone in the audience remarked.<br />
“No, I’m not” I wailed. “And I’m not a little baby!”<br />
“Then why is your peepee so small? And why is it so hard?” they retorted, resulting in raucous laughter, making me leak even more precum.<br />
 *SMACK* *SMACK* *SMACK*, “SIXTEEN! SEVENTEEN! EIGHTEEN!”<br />
<br />
I remembered as my uncle delivered my punishment my little teenage stiffie had was aching to cum. <br />
At the time I attributed it to teen hormones but here I was in my forties and I was feel the urge rising up again now just like it had in that shed all those decades ago. Instead of my uncle Chris it was my little brother Christopher, who was now a real man.<br />
*SMACK*, “NINETEEN!”<br />
<br />
After my uncle dealt the final blow my undersized penis had fired shot after shot of warm semen into my underwear. Thankfully the other two hadn’t noticed and mistook my moans of pleasure as howls of pain.<br />
Now I could feel myself right on the edge of another orgasm. There was no more hiding my sick little perversions as my tiny drooling precum spout was out for all to see. All I needed was a little push to get me over the edge. I felt Christopher rubbing my behind with the paddle, maybe worried I he had been too hard when suddenly.<br />
*SMMMAACK”, “TWENTY!”<br />
<br />
The hardest hit of the night sent a wave of force traveling from my buttocks through my body and pushing out the front of my pelvis. I felt it push my hard little nub over the edge and I began spraying shot after shot of watery cum onto the stage as hundreds of men watched, laughed and cheered.<br />
<br />
My brother walked up to me, “You really took that paddling like a big boy!” he said “That was amazing.” I suddenly had a flashback to when I we were walking back to the house from the shed as I rubbed my sore buttocks, still crying and my brother had said the exact same thing back then as he did now. As I stood there on stage rubbing my red ass with one hand and wiping the tears from my face with the other, I was glad to know he still had the same amount of respect for me as the older brother now as he did back then.</p>
