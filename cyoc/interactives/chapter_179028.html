<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary eventually passed out, his masturbation tiring him out quickly. When he woke up to his alarm the next morning, he heaved himself out of bed. Due to his hasty changes the night prior, he had put on over 40 pounds of fat over night; he was gaining over 4 pounds an hour and had most of the day left. His footfalls were heavy and the floor creaked under his weight. Blearily, he tried to pull on his clothes and found extra difficulty. He hadn&#39;t gotten around to new clothes since his last change and with an additional 40 pounds of lard, his clothes simply were not going to get on his pudgy frame. After tearing his second shirt, he tossed the rags aside and plopped down into his chair at his computer. The Chronivac was still open from the night prior; he never closed it after implementing the changes from last night. <br />
<br />
Gary didn&#39;t check his profile too carefully before delving into the menus of the Chronivac, searching for something to cure his clothing dilemma. Eventually, he found one that selectively altered reality in relation to himself. He quickly entered in that all clothes he tried to wear would resize to fit him. Grabbing his discarded shirt, it suddenly with little fanfare was now perfectly sized for him, appearing more as a massive tent of fabric till he had successfully pulled it over his head. <br />
<br />
Gary&#39;s morning was otherwise uneventful; he didn&#39;t have classes with Peter or Tyler nor Coach Larson in the morning and with his automatically resizing clothing, he didn&#39;t notice the additional 16 pounds that crept onto his frame. By lunch, he was struggling to fit into desks and most chairs. Even yesterday people gave him a wide berth and strange looks so the continued interest in his massive size didn&#39;t even register to the behemoth. His new heft came with an even greater hunger, resulting in Gary grabbing two overflowing plates of food before heading towards his typical table. He had been anticipating lunch since the night before; it be the first time he&#39;d get to see either Peter or Tyler today. And based on his quick mental math, they should be nearly 60 pounds heavier since he last saw them. That should be plenty noticeable.<br />
<br />
As Gary rounded the corner, he saw Peter sitting at the table alone. He was slouched forward, leaning over the table as he shoveled food into his mouth. His face was red and puffy and glistening slightly. Gary started marching towards him, relishing that his face did appear to have lost most of its harder edges, though it had avoided becoming fully round like Gary&#39;s. With a small flourish, Gary dropped his tray onto the table, startling Peter and drawing his gaze upwards.<br />
<br />
The two stared at each other for a few seconds, Peter seeming to stare up longingly at Gary. He was the first to break the silence, audibly gulping before squeaking out a &quot;Hey&quot; before turning back to his food and shoveling more into his mouth. Gary smirked as he sat down, the chair groaning as his weight settled into it. &quot;Hey little Pete. Or should I say &#39;round Pete&#39;? Looking a little thick around the middle there, aren&#39;t ya?&quot; Gary couldn&#39;t actually see Peter&#39;s middle that well; his position and stance did well to hide it from view. But Gary knew. Peter&#39;s cheeks went even deeper red as he hugged himself. &quot;Is... is it really that noticeable?&quot; Peter whispered. <br />
<br />
Gary smirked as he stuffed a slice of pizza into his maw. &quot;A bit ya. Its ok though. It looks good on ya. Size is good, that&#39;s what I say.&quot; Peter couldn&#39;t get any deeper red, whether he was flattered or embarrassed more, Gary couldn&#39;t tell. &quot;Th-thanks. Y-you too, Gary.&quot; Peter muttered. Gary pretended to be surprised. &quot;Oh? But just yesterday you were giving me shit for my size. Now that you&#39;ve got yourself some heft, it&#39;s all ok now?&quot; Gary asked teasingly. Peter looked away and sighed. &quot;I&#39;ve... had a strange day. I know what you&#39;ve been going through over the last month. Though it kinda... hit me harder than you, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary took a moment to stare at Peter, taking in his flushed and timid appearance. It helped sell that Gary wasn&#39;t sure what Peter meant. &quot;Really? Let me see.&quot; He tried to play it off as cool and disinterested, but Gary realized after the words left his mouth he was far more eager than he thought he should be. He subjected Peter to this change as a form of revenge, but his half-chubbed cock was telling him something different. He didn&#39;t get a chance to question himself further as the sound of chair scraping tile drew his attention to Peter. His fellow teammate had stood up, holding himself defensively as he looked away embarrassed. This had the unfortunate (or fortunate?) side effect of forcing Peter&#39;s lovely new moobs to be pushed together and up by his chunky arms. His stomach had gained a definite spherical shape to it, pulling his athletic tee shirt tight. Gary could even see a bit of the taut flesh peeking out below the hem. It was clear that Peter&#39;s weight was settling onto his frame nicely and Gary could already feel his heart start to race and his cock poking the underside of his own stomach. <br />
<br />
Peter moved to sit back down. &quot;There.&quot; Peter whispered. &quot;Wait.&quot; Gary breathed, suddenly finding himself slightly light headed. &quot;C&#39;mere.&quot; Gary nearly slurred. Peter shuddered, frozen in his spot for a moment before he shuffled around the table. He stopped, about a foot from Gary as if he&#39;s hesitant to get any closer. Gary noticed Peter&#39;s gaze was focused on Gary&#39;s own stomach. Gary grinned as he stood up, forcing Peter to move his gaze to Gary&#39;s eyes. The two stared, at each other for what felt like hours before Gary broke the silence. Suddenly, the big man closed the gap, pressing his lips against Peter&#39;s. Peter melted into the kiss, his hands breaking away and grabbing Gary&#39;s stomach in a loving, desperate embrace. Gary grabbed Peter&#39;s stomach in turn and their fervent make out was coupled with needy gropes of ever curve and fold of their large bodies. <br />
<br />
Eventually, Gary pulled back, hunger in his eyes as he stared at Peter&#39;s delirious face. Gary grinned, pulling Peter even closer before he paused as Peter&#39;s face turned to the left and started biting his lip. Gary followed his gaze and saw more than a handful of heads had turned in their direction. &quot;Uh...&quot; Peter mumbled, before looking down but not making any attempt to break their embrace. &quot;How about we find somewhere a bit more... private?&quot; Peter didn&#39;t look up but gave a small nod.</p>
