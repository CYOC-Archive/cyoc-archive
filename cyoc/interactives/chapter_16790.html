<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craig watched with envious eyes as Chris the guy who played the Grey Wolf mascot picked up Jeff and made his way to the locker room. <br />
<br />
Craig was one of the top jocks in the football team, almost 6ft and a good 190lbs of solid muscle - broad shoulders, large heavy pecs and a tight set of abs, by contrast Chris was a skinny teenager the physical opposite to Craig. But Chris had something that Craig wanted big time - it was Jake! the football captain, Chris seemed to have complete control over the submissive captain having gay sex whenever he demanded it. <br />
<br />
Jake was a heavy set guy as well, and straight acting - but Craig caught the two of them in the locker room only last week - luckily they didn't see him. Jake was sucking off Chris who was in the Grey Wolf costume. Chris had pulled down his over sized comical shorts revealing his dick sticking out of the Wolf costume. Chris was still wearing the costumes head and gloves. Jake was kneeling down in front of the Grey Wolf giving the team mascot head. Chris grabbed Jakes head with the goofy paws and face-fucked the football captain.<br />
<br />
Craig had approached Jake a couple of times, but without luck - this time Craig had an idea on how to get some action with Jake.<br />
<br />
Craig followed Chris into the locker room - it was empty apart from the two of them. Chris glanced over at Craig and nodded, and continued to unpack the Jeff. Craig smiled to himself and walked up behind Chris, and grabbed him from behind - Craig put his heavy arm around the little guys throat and he flexed hist bicep - after a few moments the sleep hold had knocked out Chris - Craig picked up the little guy and put him into the store room, he would be out for a while!<br />
<br />
Craig walked over to Jeff laying on the bench and looked over the parts of the costume - furry bodysuit, head, gloves, feet, Grey Wolf Jersey and a pair of large shorts.<br />
<br />
Craig stripped naked and picked up the bodysuit, Craig knew it it fitted Chris well, but Craig was a lot more muscular than Chris - he was wondering if Jeff would fit. Without a further through, Craig began to pull on the suit his thick legs and thighs stretched the Grey Wolfs costume legs. Craig worked the skin further up his body carefully passing his dick through the hole in the groin in the Jeff costume. He eased his tight bubble butt into the costumes ass, feeling the tail press up against his crack.<br />
<br />
Craig continued pulling the suit over his heavy chest, next Craig pulled the sleeves of the Grey Wolf up and over his muscular arms. Jeff looked through the plastic eyes of the costume head still on the bench, he felt warm as he watched his previously lifeless body was being transformed as Craig forced his muscular body into the empty skin. Craig himself was admiring the transformation the suit was beginning to fit him like a second skin in the mirror he could see the Grey fur covering his muscular arms and legs. Craig pulled the suit up around his neck, and felt around the back for the cord that was attached to the zipper - He knew this would be the tricky bit as the Jeff costume was already tight across the chest and shoulders. With one swift movement Craig took a deep breath and pulled the zipper closed - easier than he thought.<br />
<br />
Craig checked himself out again in the mirror Jeff looked great! Jeff had somehow molded himself to Craig frame - Craig struck some poses he could easily see his own muscles working below the skin, his heavy pecs and abs flexing as he breathed heavily, his dick sticking through the hole in the costume skin.<br />
<br />
Craig continued to pull on the different parts of Jeff - he knew Jake would be here soon - he always did before a game. He pulled on the shorts, and stepped into Jeff's paw like feet - first the left then the right.<br />
<br />
Next was the Grey Wolf's Jersey, Craig pulled it over the costume skin - it was tight across his chest and shoulders accentuating the large build of this new Wolf. Almost complete - Craig pulled on this funky gloves, hairy with fake claws at the end. Craig smiled at himself again in the mirror and flexed his muscles again, impressed on how flexible the Jeff was.<br />
<br />
Craig picked up Jeff's head and looked into Jeff's plastic eye's unaware of the spirit that dwells within the costume. Craig pulled the head over this over the big head with the big goofy tongue looked back at him Jeff from the masks plastic eyes, and Craig from within the head. Craig goofed around a bit like he had watched Chris do a dozen times before - but this time the teams Grey Wolf was no longer a scrawny wolf - this time he was a huge muscular wolf!<br />
<br />
Jeff, felt Craig's muscles within him knowing what was about to happen, Jeff didn't just want to be a passenger - he wanted more!<br />
<br />
Jeff realized there was a way. Jeff changed, tightening the collar around Craig's neck cutting off the air. Craig felt the tightness around his neck and quickly took off the head with the paws still on his hands he tried to pull at the collar without luck - Jeff's head now on the floor looked on as Craig went red, and full unconscious on the floor - he was OK, but he would be out like a light for a while.<br />
<br />
Craig's body twitched a couple of times, and got to it's feet, closely watched by the Jeff Costumes head. What was strange was Craig's head flopped from side to side, his eyes closed as his body make it over to mirror. Craig's body now under the control of Jeff struck a couple of poses. Satisfied with the results, Jeff walked over to a kit bag and picked up a used sock using Craig's own hands he carefully stuffed a sock into Craig's mouth, Jeff then walked over to his own Wolf's head, and carefully put it over the unconscious Graig's head - the transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
Jeff the Grey Wolf costume &quot;walked&quot; over to the mirror using Craig's body that he now controlled from the neck down. Jeff sensed a stirring, Craig was coming around. Suddenly Craig was aware, he could see through Jeff's plastic eyes, but realized he had no control of his body. He watched in panic as he saw his body pose and flex, as if testing the limits of his body, breathing heavy, spreading his wide lats, all without his doing. Jeff felt Craig's hard dick in the shorts, somehow both of the felt the rough paw grasp Craig's dick.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jeff heard a noise behind him, he turned to see Jake had entered the locker room, and locked the door behind him. Jeff was in awe of Jakes body, even bigger than Craig's. He had perfect skin, black cropped hair, and steely blue eyes. He smiled at the Grey Wolf and whispered in the ear of the Jeff's Wolfy ear - &quot;you look 100% better Grey, let me take some of your strength for the game ahead&quot;, immediately Craig (and Jeff) realize that it's not Chris that Jake has fallen for but the Grey Wolf mascot - Craig was over the moon, and know he needed to be the mascot from now on. <br />
<br />
Jeff, turned and looked at Jake - he dropped his over size shorts revealing Craig's erect dick. No words were needed, Jake dropped to his knees and began to suck on the Wolf's (Craig's) dick in an attempt to taken on some mystical strength from the teams mascot. Craig could feel that Jake was no novice at sucking off, his throat massaged the Wolfs dick and after a couple of minutes Craig shot his load into Jakes mouth and throat. Jake gulped down what he believed to be some secret elixir to make him strong throughout the game -- who was Jeff/Craig was only to pleased to give him.<br />
<br />
Jake stood up and....</p>
