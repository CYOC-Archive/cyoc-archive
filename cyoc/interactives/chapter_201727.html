<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matriarch Carmilla von Karnstein lounged lazily on her throne in the foyer of her clan&#39;s opulent manor. Holding court as a matriarch could be a tedious business on a slow day, but it couldn&#39;t really be skipped. You never knew when one of your clan might have an important request or a vampire from one of the other clans might petition for a formal audience to conduct inter-clan diplomacy.<br />
<br />
Consort Mircalla squeezed her wife&#39;s hand. &quot;Having a long day, darling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla laughed wryly. &quot;Aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Mircalla nodded. &quot;So far, it&#39;s just been an hour of staring off into space and hoping someone rings the doorbell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla sighed. &quot;I know exactly what you mean. It somehow makes eternity feel even longer. It&#39;s honestly not easy being the matriarch. I actually wish I could join Tatiana at Selena&#39;s little slumber party. I imagine that sounds juvenile, but what&#39;s life without some play?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mircalla adjusted the crown that sat on her golden hair. &quot;We could slip off for some &#39;play,&#39; you know. Large responsibility though it may be, the life of a vampire consort has one tremendous advantage over my mortal life in the 1860s, back when I was Laura Hollis. I had every comfort my father could give me... but I was lonely. Now I have you to break the silences. I propose we sneak out to the grounds and have a walk through the woods. Or perhaps we could head for our private chambers and... explore our bodies, if you understand my meaning. It strikes me as unlikely anyone shall be coming tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla smiled and shook her head regretfully. &quot;I yearn to do so, my sweet, but I cannot break protocol in such a manner. It just isn&#39;t the vampire way. So long as there&#39;s even the slightest chance a visitor may come to our clan&#39;s haven, I am bound by honor to be here to welcome them and hear their entreaties from nine in the evening &#39;til midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, the doorbell rang. Carmilla smiled more than a little gloatingly at her consort. &quot;You see, dearest? What did I tell you? One never knows when the clan&#39;s matriarch shall be needed.&quot; She issued a psychic summons for her daughter Liesel.<br />
<br />
Liesel darted into the foyer and curtsied to her matriarch. &quot;What is your wish, my sublime matriarch and progenitor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a visitor, my treasured daughter,&quot; Carmilla responded in the formal diction of vampire court speech. &quot;You may receive them into our haven.&quot; Liesel nodded and headed for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I do hope it&#39;s not Rasputin,&quot; Carmilla muttered to Mircalla. &quot;That filthy, lecherous old hobo&#39;s a disgrace to the vampire race! Why, he almost resembles a werefox who, for reasons known only to himself, has developed a personal vendetta against shampoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just praying it isn&#39;t an envoy from Clan de Rais,&quot; Mircalla responded. &quot;Not only were they allied to Clan von Wisborg back before its destruction, but they actually prey on children! Children!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla nodded. &quot;Patriarch Gilles is truly a blight on the magical community of France. I do not say this lightly, but I eagerly await the day the monster hunters destroy him and his barbaric brood. Don&#39;t worry, if it&#39;s one of the de Rais scum, I&#39;ll send them straight back to the Château de Tiffauges to tell their patriarch EXACTLY what Clan von Karnstein thinks of him. Namely, that he&#39;s a savage, heartless abomination who makes a hideous mockery of Mother Night&#39;s gifts, justifies every fearful belief humans have about vampires, and makes even Clan Bathory and Clan Tepes look benevolent by comparison. But I doubt I&#39;ll have to; it&#39;s probably just a representative of Clan Ruthven here to negotiate boundaries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liesel led the guest to Carmilla and Mircalla&#39;s thrones. Mercifully, it was neither Grigori Rasputin nor Gilles de Rais, or even a Clan Ruthven envoy. Liesel was escorting a young woman in her early twenties with shoulder-length mousy brown hair and blue eyes to the Matriarch. Judging from her rosy complexion, she was a living, mortal woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings,&quot; Carmilla said, her tone polite and formal. &quot;I am Matriarch Carmilla von Karnstein, and this is my consort, Mircalla. My haven is your sanctuary for as long as you have business within it. Who do I have the pleasure of addressing, and what need brings you to seek the hospitality of Clan von Karnstein?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman glanced tensely around the room, obviously nervous to be in a vampire clan&#39;s inner sanctum. &quot;Oh, my name? I&#39;m... I&#39;m Amanda Cooper, but everyone calls me Mandy. I&#39;m from Byron Heights, just down the Clearwater River from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Byron Heights,&quot; Carmilla interjected. &quot;I know it well. We of Clan von Karnstein occasionally have dealings with the local vampire clan, Clan Ruthven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know about the Ruthvens,&quot; said Mandy. &quot;They... couldn&#39;t help me with my problem. I&#39;ve heard of your clan&#39;s tastes in partners, Matriarch Carmilla, and the magical effect it&#39;s had on the female population of Stokerville. I was wondering... could you do that to me? Make me a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla raised an eyebrow, somewhat taken aback by this request. &quot;My I inquire as to why you would wish this? Most people appear quite happy with the orientation they&#39;re born with. There&#39;s a reason I have only ever used this magic on girls still in the womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s lots of reasons,&quot; said Mandy. &quot;Most of my relationships with men have been just plain awful. I&#39;ve been condescended to, ordered around, cheated on, even punched by this one guy who was especially shitty. I need to get away from all that testosterone. That&#39;s not the main thing, though. I met this girl in college, and she&#39;s been the best friend I&#39;ve ever had. She&#39;s kind, generous, considerate, supportive, and joyful. She&#39;s also divinely beautiful and so painfully obviously in love with me. Too bad I&#39;m straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the thing is, I really WANT to be in love with her. I already love her like a sister, and I know I&#39;ll never love any man more than I love her, but the wiring in my brain won&#39;t let me become romantically or sexually intimate with the girl who SHOULD be the love of my life. All because she has tits instead of a dick. Ugh, it&#39;s so shallow and stupid! I told her how I feel, and she said you might have the power to open my heart to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla straightened her tall platinum crown as she contemplated this unique request. &quot;And how did your friend know I was anything more than a wealthy recluse with an especially large family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy chose her words carefully. &quot;She&#39;s... not exactly normal herself. She&#39;s... an angel. Her name&#39;s Yomiel, though she&#39;s using the alias Angelica Ward. The Celestial Bureaucracy sent her to Earth on guardian angel duty, and she happened to be protecting the very college I was attending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she&#39;s courting a fellow female?&quot; Carmilla chuckled. &quot;I can think of a lot of raving fundamentalists who would be VERY disheartened to hear that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea where they got the idea that the angels are against being gay,&quot; Mandy shrugged, &quot;but I can say from experience that it just isn&#39;t true. Angels are mostly pansexual, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to know Heaven isn&#39;t totally unreasonable,&quot; said Carmilla. &quot;My dear friend Morgana Faye had a rather nasty encounter with a senior angel named Kushiel. I understand he took a very hard line against any forms of magic not expressly endorsed by the Celestial Bureaucracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomiel isn&#39;t like that,&quot; said Mandy. &quot;She believes love and kindness should always triumph over rules and regulations. Speaking of love triumphing, is there anything you can do to fix my sexual orientation? Yomiel says Lord Ruthven can&#39;t do it on account of him being straight, but you can because you&#39;re a lesbian. Is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmilla massaged her temples. &quot;This would be so much easier if you were ten or younger, when your sexual orientation is still forming. It&#39;d be REALLY easy if you were unborn, a complete blank slate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it even possible?&quot; asked Mircalla.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; said Carmilla. &quot;It will require a different sort of magic than the kind passively influencing the female populace of Stokerville. The basis of the magic will be my vampire mesmerism, but it will require something extra to make it permanent. Otherwise Mandy will just turn heterosexual again as soon as my concentration is broken. The only solution I can see is sex magic. Are you comfortable with that, Mandy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, if it means I can finally give my heart fully over to Yomiel,&quot; Mandy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I must ask you to disrobe, if you please,&quot; said Carmilla. &quot;Liesel, Might you please do the honors of pleasuring our guest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liesel nodded. She and Mandy both stripped naked. Carmilla stood up from her throne and approached Mandy. The Matriarch looked Mandy directly in the eye, and her usually obsidian-colored eyes blazed red, bathing Mandy in an infernal glow. &quot;Heed my pronouncements well, Amanda Cooper,&quot; Carmilla declared, her voice echoing with almost divine power, &quot;for I am Carmilla von Karnstein, and my word is law! Thou shalt henceforth lose all romantic and sexual desire for men and feel passion only in the arms of a woman. Moreover, thy particular soulmate is the angel Yomiel, who goeth under the false name of Angelica Ward. Be this command pleasing unto thee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Mighty One...&quot; Mandy answered in dreamy, mesmerized voice.<br />
<br />
As Carmilla fought to maintain her concentration, Liesel crouched down and raised her tongue to the lips of Mandy&#39;s pussy and began to lick at them. As Mandy&#39;s cunt began to flush with arousal, Liesel began to concentrate her erotic attentions on the human girl&#39;s engorged clitoris. The platinum-haired vampire licked and nibbled greedily at the aroused nub, stopping only to bite Mandy on the thigh to get some aphrodisiac vampire saliva into her bloodstream.<br />
<br />
Before long, Mandy&#39;s clit began to throb wildly as a wave of pleasure rushed through her trembling body. As her orgasm grew in intensity, her dripping pussy shot a jet of female ejaculate straight into Liesel&#39;s face. The vampiress happily licked up all of Mandy&#39;s juices that her tongue could reach. Human sexual fluids might not be as nutritious as blood to vampires, but it was no less delicious.<br />
<br />
Now that Mandy had orgasmed, Carmilla happily broke her concentration, the unearthly red glow fading from her dark eyes. &quot;Thank Mother Night that&#39;s over!&quot; she sighed exhaustedly. &quot;Mesmerism can drain a body like nothing else!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel any different, Mandy?&quot; Mircalla asked.<br />
<br />
Mandy looked around the room, taking in the sight of the three exquisitely beautiful vampiresses standing before her, her eyes lingering especially long on Liesel&#39;s stunning breasts. &quot;Yeah, I do. You all look so... gorgeous all of a sudden. Not that I couldn&#39;t tell you were beautiful before, but that beauty MEANS something to me now. I see you, and my body starts to get... excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought your aura felt different,&quot; Liesel smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aura?&quot; Mandy asked. &quot;Is that a vampire thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not generally,&quot; said Mircalla. &quot;Liesel is simply rather &#39;New Age,&#39; even for a seer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One last test,&quot; said Carmilla. She pointed to a large Renaissance painting hanging on the wall of the foyer depicting the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus. &quot;Look at that painting. You&#39;ll notice many attractive and scantily clad men and women. Your impressions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy studied the painting as she slipped back into her clothes. She examined the naked, chiseled body of the golden-haired Apollo. &quot;He&#39;s certainly not doing anything for me.&quot; Her eyes wandered over the muscular chest of Ares, the war god. Something in his smug expression churned Mandy&#39;s stomach. &quot;Ew, I&#39;m REALLY not attracted to that creep!&quot; Then Mandy spotted the woman standing just to Ares&#39;s right: Aphrodite. Her silky locks flowed down to her ankles like a waterfall, and her bosom was sheer perfection. And her face, it was sublime! Mandy triumphantly pointed at the gorgeous goddess. &quot;Alright, now THAT&#39;S divinity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can safely judge this magical experiment a success,&quot; Carmilla smiled. &quot;I doubt I&#39;ll need to use it again, but it&#39;s handy to have that spell in reserve, just in case I meet another girl like you, Mandy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy clasped Carmilla&#39;s hands. &quot;Thank you, Matriarch! I can&#39;t wait to tell Yomiel that it worked! Bye!&quot; She waved goodbye as she jogged back out into the night air.<br />
<br />
&quot;It always feels rewarding to do a good deed for the mortals, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; said Mircalla, smiling.<br />
<br />
Carmilla laughed. &quot;Rewarding and tiring!&quot; I think I&#39;ll take you up on that walk in the woods, my dearest. Decorum or not, I don&#39;t think I could take it if one of Gilles de Rais&#39;s clan actually DID decide to show up! Rasputin either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or Tori Vordenburg,&quot; added Liesel. &quot;Remember, Jinx foresaw her coming soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even want to think about that right now,&quot; groaned Carmilla. &quot;Right now I just want to spend a relaxing night with my bride and forget my troubles.&quot; She took Mircalla by the hand and led her to the door. &quot;I do hope Tatiana and her friends are having a more relaxing night than mine&#39;s been so far.&quot;</p>
