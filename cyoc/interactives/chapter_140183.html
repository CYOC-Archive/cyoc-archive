<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff could read the code like he was reading a book.  The Chronivac wasn&#39;t all the difficult to hack into - it was designed logically enough.  The internal storage was something he had never seen before, it looked like information was stored on some sort of crystal on a molecular level, which made for a vast amount of storage in a small space.  It blew his mind.  But all data storage shared certain main commonalities, and Jeff used his knowledge of those fundamentals to discover the problem with his Chronivac; namely, someone had been sloppy, and hadn&#39;t formatted it properly.<br />
<br />
While Jeff had no problem reading the code, he didn&#39;t want to spend weeks reviewing it all and finding the errors that occurred when that code was transferred to the improperly formatted storage.  So he did what anyone in his situation would; he used the Chronivac to boost his intelligence to maximum, so that with his already natural aptitude and a new level of human genious, he could speed-read the code, spotting and correcting errors on the fly, as easily as a proof-reader spell-checking a children&#39;s story.<br />
<br />
Kyle lay on Jeff&#39;s bed, asleep.  He&#39;d fallen asleep several hours ago, it was well past midnight and Jeff had made great progress.  He would be done very soon.  In fact, he hadn&#39;t just fixed the code, he was making enhancements to it that would have left everyone at TransDem labs drooling with envy... but Jeff had purposely left the auto-update option off after he had initially turned it on but sent the updates to a buffer so that he would have to approve them before they were applied.  The healthy distrust of authority he had paid off well in this case; someone at TransDem had tried to send instructions to the Chronivac that would limit it&#39;s power.  Now, that wouldn&#39;t be an issue; Jeff had single-handedly revolutionized the software end of the technology in just a few hours.<br />
<br />
Naturally, he hadn&#39;t started it right away.  First, he showed Kyle how it worked, and they had had some fun with it.  Kyle&#39;s busy blonde hair was a little longer how (Jeff liked it that way), and Kyle now had dark stubble and a hairy chest that he&#39;d never had before, not to mention even thicker armpit hair.  Oh, and a larger cock and balls... Jeffery loved large cocks and balls.  He had even added Kyle&#39;s thumb print to the Chronivac and let him make some changes.<br />
<br />
But then when Jeff was trying to solve the memory retention and lingering memory issues with the device, they both knew that Jeff would have to get down and serious.  This left Kyle worried, that what they felt for each other might be lost somehow, but Jeff promised him nothing would be lost, and assured him that he had to fix this or their memories and emotions might continue changing seemingly randomly.  Finally, Kyle just had to trust him, and so after watching for an hour, fell asleep on the bed.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Jeff did was reset himself completely, getting his body hair back to normal, since that had still been altered.  Next, he worked on boosting his intelligence.  Then he unplugged the unit and took it partially apart to asses the physical perameters he was working with.  That&#39;s when he discovered the very advanced crystal storage drive.  After that, he reassembled it with ease, and reactivated it.  Then he made his first run through the code.  As he did, he discovered the formatting errors which lead to errors in the code.  He was able to jury-rig a solution and fix the code errors on his first run through.  It was then that his emotions returned to normal, and his sexuality.  Kyle&#39;s seemed to already be normal, so he really had a huge crush on Jeff.  Jeff didn&#39;t tell him, but simply kept working.  As he worked, he did discover he really did like Kyle, and even cared for him.  But Jeff himself wasn&#39;t gay, and he simply couldn&#39;t be what Kyle wanted him to be.  He couldn&#39;t get into that with the boy now though, he needed to fix the Chronivac and get control of all the situations his careless use of this technology had unleashed.  Moreover, he had also used his newly created intelligence to hack into TransDem Laboratories&#39; computers, and what he found was troubling; they had sent over 100 of these units out - it was like giving hand granades to chimpanzees.  Plus they seemed to be manipulating and maneuvering worldwide; if Jeff didn&#39;t know any better he&#39;d say someone at TransDem was hellbent on literally taking over and reshaping the world.  But the big question that remained was this: They had created the Chronivac, with just one unit a person could effectively do this... so why hadn&#39;t whoever was orchestrating things already jumped at the opportunity?<br />
<br />
And even more immediately troubling to Jeff, he discovered TransDem had sent an agent out to bring him in - they had discovered he might have potential to fix the very issues with the Chronivac that he indeed already fixed with his just an hour ago; changes would be effective everywhere immediately, and the 20 foot distance limitation was no longer an issue for his own unit.  He knew now that a single push of the initiate button would keep the hour-long safety feature in play - so that if the button wasn&#39;t pushed a second time within the first hour to affirm the transformation (be it temporary by timer or whenever the user reversed it, or permanent) then the changes would be undone.  So that was why he handn&#39;t ended up trapped as gay little Jeffery earlier that day - when Coach Gillian had come to the house and gotten within 20 feet of Jeff (the targetting distance needed), he was immediately reverted to his old self.<br />
<br />
The TransDem agent wouldn&#39;t be a problem; genius Jeff hacked into the Chronivac remote the agent had with him, uploaded a special version of the software into the unit with one preset profile in it, and a trojan that would wipe the software clean and render the unit harmless after it&#39;s single use.  When the flight landed, no one would find Ryan Simmonds on the plane he had boarded to get to Jeff; all they would find would be a little tan chihuahua that would find a home with one of the airline staff families.<br />
<br />
Kyle moaned in his sleep, turning on the bed.  Jeff continued working.  He was nearly done with the software.  He had created a new code compression that cut the storage space need down to a fraction of what it previously was.  He then uploaded all the software from the computer into the remote unit itself.  Then he only had a few hardware adjustments to make, to add the new interactive holographic and optical display he had come up with.  Once that was done, he wouldn&#39;t even need the computer to do all the fine-tuning he wanted - and with the enhancements to the software he had added, he had even more controls he could manipulate.  The computer interface would look like a clunky child&#39;s toy next to the new interface he had created that night.<br />
<br />
The code was done, compiled, and ready for use.  Jeff went downstairs quietly and got a few tools and parts from around the house, careful not to wake his mother, who had gone to bed after watching Hell&#39;s Kitchen hours ago.  He returned to his room.  Kyle was still asleep.  Good.  He didn&#39;t want any interruptions.  He started working on the hardware end of things.<br />
<br />
A half-hour later, Jeff had finished his work.  He sealed the small remote unit - now not even a remote unit since it was the whole Chronivac in its new hand-held form.  TransDem could never get their hands on it, Jeff would see to it that they didn&#39;t.  &quot;There.  Finally done,&quot; Jeff said quietly to himself with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Jeff blacked out.</p>
