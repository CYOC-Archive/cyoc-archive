<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking John made for the phone and dialled Sara&#39;s mobile number. All she could do was leave a message &#39;It&#39;s me. I&#39;m back home. I can&#39;t find the medallion. Do you have it? I want to change&#39;<br />
<br />
All she could do was wait for Sara to return. Meanwhile she got out of the tube dress and looked around for something more comfortable to wear. John&#39;s own clothes were way too big and baggy but he found the bags of clothes Sara had come home with yesterday afternoon. John didn&#39;t understand why Sara had bought so much but she was grateful to put something a bit more modest on.<br />
<br />
She found a new bra and panties which fit her perfectly along with some jeans and a white long sleeved top. The jeans were pink and the top seemed to be made of satin or something similar, however at least she no longer felt she looked like a prostitute. She also had to admit that wearing a bra was comfortable - it helped to support the weight of her breasts.<br />
<br />
She then made a coffee, sat down in the lounge and waited to hear from Sara.<br />
<br />
Sara meantime was 50 metres away, in the neighbouring house, cooking Bill breakfast. Had she really just spent the night in Bill&#39;s bed? She was pinching herself. This had to be a dream. Bill Edmundson, the hunky football player who had bought the house next door to her and John several years ago. She had spent many mornings with her bridge friends looking out her side window as they mutually admired Bill working in his garden. Bill seemed to spend a lot of time shirtless in his garden. All the bridge ladies agreed he was the hunkiest man about town and Sara never had trouble getting a bridge party together. <br />
<br />
She did feel guilty about John. She had been faithful to him for forty years. There had been many times when she had been tempted to stray, she was a good looking woman and had had plenty of offers over the years. However for whatever reason she had this loyalty to her marriage vows and had never gone the whole way.<br />
<br />
She had come close several times. Once she had passionately kissed a work colleague at a Christmas party but in the end had chickened out of his offer to get a motel room. She had put that down as John&#39;s fault. He had promised to attend that party with her but then pulled out at the last minute to go to a party at his own workplace. Then there was the time only a couple of years ago when she went to a week long Bridge conference with her friend Anna. Anna was a terrible flirt and had picked up a couple of gentlemen at one of the Bridge functions. She had invited them back to their unit and things had progressed from there. Left with a tall man called Malcolm while Anna and Malcolm&#39;s friend disappeared into Anna&#39;s bedroom, Sara had not only kissed Malcolm  but had let him remove her top and feel her breasts. However she had then backed out and fortunately Malcolm was a gentleman and acceded to her wishes not to go any further. That was John&#39;s fault as well, he had refused to attend the conference with her.<br />
<br />
Now there was last night. Sara had to admit that she had finally broken her marriage vows. She had found out that Bill was every bit as good in bed as she had imagined. He was huge down below. His thingy had to be approaching 9 inches when erect - twice the size of John. However despite her initial fears on seeing the monster her body had accepted Bill&#39;s member eagerly. Bill had her climaxing on multiple occasions - she could barely remember the last time John had got her to heaven, probably 20 years ago. She had got used to faking it with John just so he would finish and get off her.  With Bill she wanted him to stay inside her and any moaning she did was totally involuntary. <br />
<br />
And then Bill&#39;s recovery was remarkable. Early in her marriage with John they had twice managed sex late at night then again early the next morning. But that was many years ago. For the last 20 years John was lucky to be able to have an erection more than once per week, even then it was likely to fizzle out before he could mount her. However Bill was remarkable. Four times last night he had filled her womb with his seed. Then he had done it twice again in the morning. That was a years worth of sex with John in one night. Maybe she had aided Bill a little on that fourth time last night. She had used her tongue to revive Bill&#39;s monster. She had never tried that with John. Indeed until last night the thought of having a penis in her mouth had disgusted her.<br />
<br />
She justified her straying as John&#39;s fault all the same. The slut had last been seen dancing with some seedy looking guys. If John (or Mandy as was easier to think of her) wanted to dance she could have joined her and Bill. Bill had offered to dance with her on multiple occasions but Mandy refused to leave the corner table, seemingly intent on just getting drunk. Certainly she had seemed quite drunk when finally seen dancing. Then Mandy was gone. She and Bill had asked around the club, eventually they found a doorman who said he saw a twin of Sara leave arm in arm with a man in a business suit about an hour earlier. He didn&#39;t see which way they went.<br />
<br />
Sara had tried calling John&#39;s mobile but found her own handbag ringing. John&#39;s Samsung phone was inside. In the end they went home without her. They first went to her own house, Mandy wasn&#39;t there. Sara checked the medallion was still present and for an unknown reason put it in her handbag. Then Bill invited Sara back to his place for a nightcap and she agreed. Her imagination at that stage pictured Mandy in bed with the strange businessman. Once in his house Sara was then easy prey for a bachelor about town such as Bill. One kiss and she was very soon being undressed in Bill&#39;s bedroom. Sara had actually forgotten about John for the duration of the night. She did after all have &quot;Bigger&quot; things to think about. <br />
<br />
However now cooking breakfast for Bill, as she had done most mornings for John over the last 40 years, Sara was feeling just a little guilty. She checked her phone. She had put it on silent last night. She saw the message from John. Shit! He was home. The message was from half an hour ago. She couldn&#39;t be caught at Bill&#39;s. She thought quickly then texted a reply. <br />
<br />
&#39;Still out looking for you. Have been up all night. Will be home in 30 minutes. Don&#39;t worry I have the medallion&#39;<br />
<br />
Then it was a case of delivering Bill his breakfast. It was very difficult not to return to his bed. Sara was very tempted but the thought of John being only 50 meters away made her desist. She put the dress she had been wearing last night back on as she explained the situation to Bill. They agreed to a story of being out all night unsuccessfully looking for Mandy. Bill also then put on the clothes he had been wearing last night. The two of them then snuck out Bill&#39;s side door which couldn&#39;t be seen from John and Sara&#39;s house. They walked down to the main street, on the way Bill said hello to Max, a friend of John&#39;s who was cutting his hedge. He didn&#39;t need to explain who Sara was. Often attractive young ladies were seen visiting Bill&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Near the train station they found a taxi. The driver was a bit annoyed when the address he was told to take them to was so close. However he was happy when Bill gave him $50 and said to keep the change.<br />
<br />
John still in the lounge saw the taxi pulling into the driveway. Out jumped Bill and Sara. They were still in the clothes they were wearing last night. So they had been looking for him/her after all. She opened the door and let them in.</p>
