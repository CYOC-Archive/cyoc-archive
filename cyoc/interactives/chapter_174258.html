<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around lunch time by the time, Nate, Rose and Nate’s grandparents the retired King and Queen of this merkingdom had reached the North Palace in the massive series of buildings called the Summer Palace. Nate’s sister the mermaid Amara had stayed behind in the central palace talking with multiple people in the Palace public relations office.<br />
<br />
They had journeyed into the Northern Palace passing by a large statue of a mermaid and a merman in full armor holding spears. The statues where nearly as large as the long series of colonnade which ran around the building. The palace spoke of spender and wonder, gold, silver, other prices metals where worked into the marble walls and floors. Tapestries hung from the walls and paints on the walls. <br />
<br />
Rose wondered how the paints where made under water but assumed just that the merfolk had found a way to make paints that could be used underwater. Statues lined the hallways and the royal guards could be seen moving about along with members of the staff. Mermaids and merman looked at Nate and Rose with some confusion, some did come up and introduce themselves and asking if they could do anything.<br />
<br />
“We could use a lunch, if that isn’t too much trouble, Tibus” Said the Queen to the head butler who looked as old as the retired King and Queen themselves. <br />
<br />
“Of course, your grace, we have already set up a table with a small spread for the Crown Prince’s friends, they are in the drawing room.” Explained Tibus<br />
<br />
“Thanks…we will just have what they are having.” Stated Nate’s grandpa<br />
<br />
“I would like some tea.” Added his grandmother<br />
<br />
“Of course…would the crown Prince of his betroth like something as well?” inquired Tibus as Rose and Nate looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Ah…we had this type of juice when I had dinner with Amara when we were transforming.” Started Nate as he explained the drink and what it tasted like. <br />
<br />
“Ah…Nvinad Juice, that is Amara’s favorite as well as your mothers.” Said Tibus as Nate’s eyes widened a bit. “I will get some fresh drink made at once.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have something like coffee?” inquired Rose, she basically ran off coffee. <br />
<br />
“We do.” Confirmed Tibus with a slight grin “That is the King’s favorite drink so we keep a good supply of it.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Said Rose as they kept moving down the hallway before making a turn into the drawing room. <br />
<br />
Drawing rooms where suppose to be to entertain guests when visiting, so it was basically a living room. But neither Rose nor Nate had ever been in a living room like this. Large windows brought in a massive amount of natural light, every other window was stain glass adding color to the room. The white marble floor was countered by a black marble ceiling. Little out covers lined the far wall, some with plants other with seats built in for private talks. A long table filled the room at the end of the room, it was covered with food. If this was a small spread of food, she did not want to see what a feast looked like.<br />
<br />
Other tables and chairs filled the room, some on ground floor some floating in the middle of the room, while others near the ceiling. Since merfolks could easily swim up and down, it only made sense to make use as much of the space they could. Rose spotted their friends, enjoying the food and talking among themselves and a few mermaids and merman she didn’t know. <br />
<br />
“Come on lets get a seat.” Said the retired King as they moved to one of the center sitting areas near one of the large windows in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
“Rose, Nate.” Said Taylor as she swum up only to stop when she saw the elderly mer couple. <br />
<br />
“Taylor, these are my Grandparents.” Introduced Nate “Grandma, Grandpa this is Taylor, she is Rose’s best friend.”<br />
<br />
“Ah…glad to meet you.” Said the former Queen.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Taylor as one by one all their friends moved up and he and Rose introduced them. Once that was done they pulled back to give Nate and Rose more time to talk to the elderly couple. Within moments of sitting down, the wait staff brought out their drinks. <br />
<br />
“So lets keep talking, we have so much to catch up on.” Said his grandfather as they kept talking. <br />
<br />
After about an hour, Rose excused herself and got up, she had to use the restroom. After being guided to the bathroom she came back in and spotted Amanda floating alone in the far edge of the room looking out of the window. She looked toward Nate who was talking with his grandparents and decided she wouldn’t be missed for a moment or two.<br />
<br />
“Amanda…are you ok?” inquired Rose as Amanda out a sigh and looked out the Window. <br />
<br />
“I keep thinking about everyone we loss.” Said Amanda as Rose looked down at the floor, her tail flicking into view every so often. <br />
<br />
“I guess…with everything happening I haven’t been thinking about it.” Admitted Rose as she thought about what was likely happening. They would have been finishing their vacation yesterday, so likely phone calls where being made and the coast guard would be sent out to look for the missing group of people. They would not be found and after a couple of days of searching, they would be declared lost, their families would believe them dead and would grieve their loss. <br />
<br />
“I just hope my father and step-mother will be ok.” said Rose as she thought about her father and stepmother, her birth mother had died in a car wreck when she was 7 and her father had remained 6 years later when she was 13. She didn’t get along fully with her stepmother or her step siblings but they all loved each other. “I just hope that they can pull strength form each other.”<br />
<br />
“I know my parents will say it was the will of God or punishment for my sins.” added Amanda “But…”<br />
<br />
“But what?” inquired Rose<br />
<br />
“While I love them, I am not sad to be away from them.” stated Amanda<br />
<br />
“Is something going on?” inquired Taylor as she swam up to Amanda and Rose<br />
<br />
“Just thinking about what we lost.” Stated Amanda <br />
<br />
“Oh…” said Taylor her voice filled with sadness as well. “I have been trying to push that to the back of my mind. My mother will not take the news well and since father died only two years ago, this will crush her. I guess only really Nate and maybe Sam didn’t loss anything.”<br />
<br />
“Sam has family.” Countered Amanda<br />
<br />
“Whom has put so much pressure on him, he hates them.” stated Taylor “Hell, his parents hate me, the only good thing they like about me is that I look good on their son’s arm. I am not up to their pedigree.”<br />
<br />
“I will miss my mom, but I will not miss them.” stated Taylor “And I have been asking about these corals and sea weed, I can’t wait to study them. Sam is already talking to them about their laws, he still wants to become a lawyer.”<br />
<br />
“And I bet Mike is going crazy over the architect of this place.” laughed Rose as Taylor pointed toward where Mike where talking with an older merman. <br />
<br />
“He is currently talking the ear off one of the people in charge of maintaining this place.” explained Taylor “Sam and Stacy are talking with the someone from the royal legal department.”<br />
<br />
“That makes sense, both where going to law school after all.” Stated Amanda “I wonder if I can still become a teacher here.”<br />
<br />
“I am sure you can, Kenny and Kelly are talking about what they will have to do to get degrees in their fields.” Said Taylor “We may have lost a lot but I think we may gain a lot as well.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Admitted Amanda before Taylor lowered her voice. <br />
<br />
“Also Kelly asked one of the female guards about birth control and she told her they have the same basic stuff they have on the surface.” Whispered Taylor “So none of us will have to worry about getting pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“Still I think I’ll wait a little, I don’t want to go swimming up to a guard and ask.” said Rose as she thought about it. “I guess wanting to talk to a doctor will not be too odd.”<br />
<br />
“I am sure it will not be.” stated Taylor before Rose noticed the sad look on Amanda’s face. <br />
<br />
“I am sorry, we shouldn’t have brought it up.” Apologized Rose “I am sure you will find someone down here and whoever your boyfriend was will be fine.”<br />
<br />
“Boyfriend….ya.” said Amanda under her breath as both Rose and Taylor raised an eyebrow as Amanda blushed a deep read. <br />
<br />
“Wait…it isn’t a boyfriend is it, it is a girlfriend?” inquired Rose, as Amanda blushed and backed away. “That is why you didn’t invite her on the trip, you didn’t want to be outed.”<br />
<br />
“I…I…” said Amanda <br />
<br />
“It’s ok, you are among friends and people who will not judge you.” said Taylor as she put a hand on her friend’s shoulder. “You don’t have to tell us anything, whatever it is it is your business, but we support you.”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” said Rose with a smile as Amanda looked at the floor, Rose understood how this would be extremely hard for Amanda. If she was a lesbian or bi-sexual she would feel ashamed, her family was ultra-religious and ultra conservative, like doom and hellfire levels of pressure and really sexiest, she had said that her parents had only allowed her to study either nursing or early childhood education. Those jobs where acceptable for a women in the view of her family, Amanda couldn’t stand the sight of blood so teacher it was. If she is gay/lesbian, then she would be disowned by her whole family. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Amanda</p>
