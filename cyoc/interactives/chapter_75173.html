<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up next to the peasant the next day, sure it was one of the warmest nights I have spent since being <br />
captive, but he certainly didn't know what a bath was. Once freed from the night spell that bind us to bed I <br />
was sure to correct it. &quot;It's freezing!&quot; complained, certainly his equipment showed that in did it was cold.<br />
<br />
Mercifully I could convince Morgana to give him some clothes. Humble ones like mine, but at least he was <br />
dressed. I tried to enquire Olaf of his motives to become the servant of the witch by their own device. But <br />
luckily for him, we were cut off when his advertisement paid up sooner than we expected. And it did in spades <br />
for he had managed to entangle non other than a most famous adventurer and hero.<br />
<br />
With a built up frame, blond almost white hair. With his famous fulminant blade, and wooden owl companion. My <br />
I grinned, for if but a speck of his legend was true then he would be able to submit the witch. But my <br />
exciment was little when compared to Morgana when she came to us holding her new mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by all the powers! I can't believe I have actually lured HIM here.&quot; said Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said you didn't wanted sons of kings and whatnot. I mean his exploits are famous...&quot; I was <br />
curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why child, I couldn't care less of a rat's ass about his exploits as a wandering hero I believe he fashion <br />
himself.&quot; meanwhile Jack unsheathed his famous blade and with a fierce slash destroyed the front door. &quot;And as <br />
little fact most often ignored he is actually a prince.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A prince? Did some princess actually allure him into marriage?&quot; asked Olaf, obviously also in the dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No! I mean he is pure blue blood. He is the son of an enemy of mine, the fabled Snow Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Bringer of Winter.&quot; I was surprised to learn that such renown hero was the son of the vile Mistress of <br />
Winter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress I can't help but notice that the man is just in the next room.&quot; said somewhat nervously Olaf.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh yes! Don't worry the door is enchanted I will take him a while to break through in the mean time...&quot; <br />
said regaining some composure.<br />
<br />
-o-o-o-<br />
<br />
Blasting through the last door, appeared Jack Frost, with his wooden companion on though. &quot;Morgana I come to <br />
free the princess, from her captivity! That's assuming she wants to be rescued.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you even have to ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact I do. When you dedicate to being a hero like myself, you often find that some captives <br />
weren't captives at all, or that actually had been freed.&quot; explained Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taketh not a step furthereth, oh most reviled enemy, for I Morgana shall end thy fate.&quot; spoke the witch.<br />
<br />
But Jack didn't replied he simply swung the sword, in her direction vaporizing her. The shackle of the <br />
princess magically undid. &quot;My hero!&quot; she said planting a kiss on his cheek. He carried her away.<br />
<br />
-0-0-0-<br />
<br />
The keep appeared empty, but just because of one of the glamour of Morgana, as soon as Jack had left. I became <br />
visible and could talk again, and she came downstairs. &quot;My that was easy. For such an experienced hero, <br />
vanquishing a light construct believing it was me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you left him go. With Olaf posing as me, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack is the son of the Snow Queen, as he is he has a great resistance against magic. But every armor has a <br />
chink.&quot;<br />
<br />
-0-0-0-<br />
<br />
On the way to Sarah's kingdom, they stopped at an inn, he insisted in having separate rooms, but later that <br />
night. 'She' came to his room, while he was already shirtless.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hero, let me show you gratitude.&quot; said the fake Sarah as she undid her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;My princess, that's not necesa-&quot; she kissed him as he forced his way on his pants, caressing his balls. Any <br />
uncertainty he had vanished returning the kiss. His hose quickly discarded, he introduced his pulsing rod on <br />
her. Sucking on her tits as she grabbed his ass, compelling to thrust hader.<br />
<br />
The inn keeper was scandalized.<br />
<br />
Finally they both lay by each other. &quot;That was amazing.&quot; complied Jack. &quot;And we are not done.&quot; said 'Sarah'<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid, for a while I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's other ways.&quot; 'she' said putting the finger in his arsehole. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh!&quot; she whispered. &quot;You have never tried I presumed, but you have not to worry. After all Am I not a <br />
woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT REALLY&quot; thought Morgana caressing herself looking at the whole spectacle with her mirror from within her <br />
quarters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... Ahhhh. uhmmmm...&quot; moaned Jack, obviously enjoying it. Meanwhile a grin appeared in Morgana as she did <br />
a previous spell.<br />
<br />
Jack was so enthralled he fail to notice his bedmate's breast retreating into a flat chest, and her hair <br />
growing shorter, and her pussy sprouting forth into a manhood still coated in the seed of the deceived hero. <br />
Olaf pulled his fingers and inserted something slippery, with more girth. &quot;What's that?&quot; asked Jack feeling a <br />
bigger intrusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more, and spit to lubricate.&quot; still with the voice of Sarah he lied and proceeded to fuck the prince <br />
until both climaxed. And while he enjoyed the experience, he also felt the 'shoot' from her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What matter of?&quot; he said as he turned around and saw naked Olaf with his member dripping from their combined <br />
fluids. &quot;You dared to befoul me?&quot; He said reaching for the assailant neck. But as he was about to smithe, his <br />
cock sent a wave of pleasure as it erupted load after load of cum all over the room. As he was under such a <br />
blissful attack he failed to notice how his muscles began to fade away, how his height became to decrease, his <br />
mature looks regressed and ears got pointer. He kept shooting away his own self, until he became nothing more <br />
than an little imp. Small enough to fit on a hand.<br />
<br />
-0-0-0-0-<br />
<br />
I knew what she had done, she was excited to tell me with luxury of detail. A small nagging question formed in <br />
my head, until I finally spit it out. &quot;Why didn't you change into me? Why leaving the fucking to someone else, <br />
I thought that it was the whole point of alluring princes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is an exception. I will not lay, not matter how fulfilling it would be, with the whelp of my enemy. Beside <br />
letting him be fuck by a lowly peasant boy, now that's humiliating, and more my style. By the end of the end <br />
the prince who would bed any woman, will be begging for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
By supper the next day Olaf returned wearing the clothes of Jack, bringing a small jar containing the reduce <br />
hero. Morgana took the blade and the clothes away (leaving Olaf naked again), no doubt for her doll collection <br />
and whatnot. But she gave the jar to me, before I could retrieve his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well princess, you wanted Jack to come so bad, here he is. His life is your responsibility. He is now a tear <br />
imp.&quot; said showing me the small, whimpering, blue, nude creature. &quot;And he will die unless he remains moist at <br />
night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't mean...&quot; I said, she just replied with a grin.<br />
<br />
By later that night a new doll was adorning Morgana collection, and I slept again beside the nude Olaf, with <br />
my former hero nesting for his life inside my lady parts. I'm ashamed to admit that he was most wet that <br />
night.</p>
