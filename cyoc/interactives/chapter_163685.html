<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The park was shutting down for the night, which meant that the rank and file mascots were free to do as they pleased for a few hours before getting beddy-bye. But there were still booths to restock, food to prepare for the next morning, and the many other things Whimsy World needed to keep running. And the admin mascots had to their part. <br />
<br />
Payments Patty hopes that Legal Ludwig won that under the table court case that that just because Whimsy World was becoming bigger on the inside than the outside, that it still took up the same space OUTSIDE the park, and therefore couldn&#39;t be charged an extra big land tax. <br />
<br />
While it might have seemed odd that Whimsy World still needed to pay land tax all things considered, but the park was doing its best to peacefully assimilate into the world. Just as an endless string of kidnappings would get the FBI&#39;s attention, the IRS would eventually get attention if they realized this mysterious giant theme park wasn&#39;t paying taxes. <br />
<br />
Patty was still going over ledgers when her husband stepped in, she cringed a bit seeing his beautiful cartoonish body hidden behind that stiff business suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to wearing that silly suit?&quot; Payments Patty asked, lounging in her chair, herself wearing only a collar with an emerald dollar sign tag as normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so the humans take me seriously. Dealing with a cartoon wolf is hard enough for them. I just didn&#39;t have time to take it off after dealing with them.&quot; Legal Ludwig said, stripping down to just his red tie. &quot;It&#39;s annoying enough if they ask if my bar association license is real.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;So how&#39;s our new night in shining armor?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Confused. Uncomfortable. Befuddled. But going along with the flow and assimilating into the family. Why again does  Milly the Husky insist on pushing out the newborns right after they&#39;re given their &#39;spiritual essence transfusion&#39;?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She said it was to help jump-start their true mascot self and keep their donor&#39;s self from completely taking hold of them. But hey, Milly&#39;s mascot resources, not me. I&#39;m sure she knows what she&#39;s doing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like with Zoey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone makes mistakes,&quot; Payments Patty said. &quot;I asked Security Sally check the cameras,  they show that Jingles The Cat didn&#39;t make contact with him, guess she prefers to see if their junk data lasts the night before slamming them with existential philosophy.&quot; While Whimsy World did have security cameras, they were only in public areas, Security Sally didn&#39;t want to drive the mascots or guests insane thinking they were ALWAYS being watched. <br />
<br />
&quot;A part me wonders if she&#39;s playing a game, being HELPFUL, or both. I don&#39;t know WHY you had me personally check up on him. We could have just had one of Sally&#39;s big cats tell him to meet Dr. Z tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know Zoey. She&#39;s WHY we get rid of the junk data. She&#39;s still convinced she was kidnapped, tuned into a mascot, and a clone of her was sent out to live with her family instead. Just a good way to make sure she hadn&#39;t snagged him, she&#39;s getting more crafty.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he should be laying down to bed in a minute, and his junk data will be a thing of the past.&quot; <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
 You were impressed how none of the other mascots reacted much to Legal Ludwig&#39;s presence, seemed the admin mascots were just accepted. You did think how there HAD TO BE more lounges and bunks in the park than this, given how big you knew the park to be. Since you&#39;d seen no sign of the white rabbit mascot who had gotten you into this to begin with. <br />
<br />
You were surprised to find other knights... all sleeping in their suits of armor... which actually fit the comical and cartoonish tone this place had. <br />
<br />
One was a bluejay mascot, wearing a bassinet helmet that completely concealed his head but just make his beak all the more obvious. He wore a Surcoat that did nothing to hide his non-existent modesty. A spear with a head shaped like a boxing glove was next to the bed. Sir Jay the Bluebird you remembered. <br />
<br />
There was also the Black Knight, in all his sinister glory, his snores echoing in his helmet. He was done up in black and red armor with his exaggerated arms clasped over his belly, his great helm was shaped like a soup can with a visor obscuring his head with a mace next to him, though the spikes looked to be have been dulled. <br />
<br />
Then there was another animal mascot knight... Sir Lion Heart (guess what animal he was, go ahead!), done up in gold and white armor with a blue cape, and a glowing magical white sword that would never harm the righteous or innocent, having already said his prayers before bed. <br />
<br />
And Sir Percy the Lanky Knight, another human type, with armor that was as skinny as he was, and a lance that was taller than he was. He looked absolutely silly. His head concealing helmet was an Armet. <br />
<br />
And because there had to be, there was Dame Scarlet (Dame being the female equivalent to Sir for Knight), a bright red vixen, wielding an oversized  chakram. Her armor covering her paws and hands, arm braces, and a suit of armor made to resemble female superheroes with the shoulder and legs exposed... You know this was utterly insane tactically, but you remembered Dame Scarlet moving like a blur as she slew dragons and beheaded trolls kicking their heads away making the trolls chase after their own heads. <br />
<br />
And of course your mentor. It seemed you&#39;d gotten here late since they&#39;d all gone to bed already. Time for you to get some sleep too. You laid down on the only unoccupied bed, seeing items that you recognize as your own even though you&#39;d never laid eyes on them before. You went to sleep, listening to the sweet peaceful lullaby coming from the speaker. <br />
<br />
And you sleep deeply... And... faces left you... names left you... places left you... ones that had nothing to do with Whimsy Park, and mostly certainly had nothing to do with Fantasy Kingdom, let alone Sir Hammer... In your dream, you wondered if you should be upset at losing these things, but the more you taught about it, the more trouble you had trying to figure out what you were supposed to be upset about. <br />
<br />
Instead of feeling like you were being robbed, you felt like you&#39;d had a heavy burden lifted from your shoulders. But you did know one thing! Fantasy Kingdom of Whimsy World needed its brave knights to defend it from the tireless monsters and the greedy Burningstein The Red Dragon. (You vaguely recalled his name was supposed to be Feuerwald, but too many misunderstood what the name meant!). You woke up the next day among your fellow knights, ready to face your first full day as a mascot of Whimsy World!</p>
