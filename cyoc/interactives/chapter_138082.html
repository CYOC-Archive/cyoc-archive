<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a few moments, Pete couldn&#39;t move a single muscle. He was just so much in shock and awe of what had just happened. He was still himself without being himself. His thoughts, his memories, everything inside his head still the same. Apart from one thing - his shape. He was a fully-formed adult Komodo Dragon, standing stock-still in the middle of a disused quarry with the sun bathing his skin with its light and warmth.<br />
After a few minutes of inactivity, suddenly, he was deluged with a surge of new sensations! He could feel the warmth of the sun coursing through his body. He could smell scents which were undetectable to a human. He could hear sounds so silent around him as though they were being played through a loudspeaker at full volume and he could FEEL them through his whole body. He opened his new mouth for the first time and pushed out with his tongue in the same way that he felt the pressure of pushing his tongue out when he was transforming. He could TASTE the air around him. So many different odours being detected through his tongue he was almost overwhelmed with the information which was coursing through his body.<br />
At last, he began to move around. His gait was quite ungainly, but as he walked, his tail flicked this way and that to keep his balance. Suddenly, he tasted a new odour. The taste of rotting flesh, of FOOD! He turned his lizard body and flicked out his tongue to detect from where the smell was coming from. As he walked towards it, the taste got stronger and stronger. Finally, he saw it. The body of a fox. About thirty feet away from where he stood.<br />
&quot;I guess this is food for the Komodo Dragon, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll like the taste of dead fox!&quot; Pete thought to himself. But wishing to experience the WHOLE transformation sensation, he carried on. <br />
&quot;If I&#39;ve been given this gift it&#39;s important not to shy away from it - I need to go for it!&quot;<br />
Pete reached the dead fox. It&#39;d not been long dead as the dragon&#39;s senses could detect a residual warmth in its body.<br />
&quot;It must have been hit by a car and limped over here to try and find some safety, but it died.&quot;<br />
Pete could see that its hind leg was shattered and blood had spattered over the fox&#39;s body. Pete moved his nostrils towards the still-warm dead fox. It smelled good, very good, delicious in fact.<br />
&quot;Here goes&quot; Pete said to himself &quot;My first taste of a dead animal as a Komodo Dragon!&quot;<br />
He opened his jaws. He found that he could open his jaws far wider than he thought he&#39;d be able to. He felt the saliva in his mouth flowing almost like water from a tap. With a crunch, the jaws closed in on the back leg of the fox and the dragon bit it off in one mouthful. Flesh, bones, sinews, fur and claws all began to be chewed to a pulp. It was like he was eating bread, it was almost effortless to reduce the fox&#39;s leg to a saliva-soaked mush. With a gulp, he swallowed everything in his mouth.<br />
&quot;Wow, that tastes good! Whoever would have thought that I&#39;d be eating a dead fox!&quot;<br />
The lizard&#39;s jaws continuted to tear large parts of the fox&#39;s body to pieces and eat them in the same way until nothing remained. Flesh, bone, fur, sinew, fur, claws, intestines and organs all were consumed.<br />
Pete walked back into the sunshine and found a warm spot in which to digest his meal. He felt not a little tired and lethargic now. But not his brain! It was the lizard&#39;s body which felt tired and lethargic. Pete couldn&#39;t account for this, but thought it all part of the transformation process - after all, he still had human thoughts in his dragon&#39;s head. So, he found a secluded corner of the quarry which he thought would be safe pushed himself right in close to the rocks and then soon went to sleep. As the body of the Komodo Dragon slept, Pete was eager to think about how he would transform himself back to normal and what his next transformation might be. But first, he had to wait as the Komodo Dragon digested its meal.<br />
As time passed by, Pete lay there feeling quite comfortable and cosy. He could sense the fox&#39;s remains being digested inside the dragon&#39;s stomach. It was a weird sensation. Definitely not a human sensation! He could feel that this meal was giving the animal more energy and power to move when it was ready. Pete too now began to feel tired as though his brain needed to shut itself down in slumber for a few hours.<br />
With a start, Pete&#39;s thoughts came back to him. How long had he been asleep? A few minutes, hours? He had no way of telling. The Komodo Dragon&#39;s body was stirring and was ready to move. He stood up, opened his eyes and surveyed his surroundings. Tasting the air with his forked tongue, Pete detected no danger. He walked towards where he&#39;d put his clothes. He could still see the slight depression in the ground where he&#39;d transformed into the dragon. He turned and lay in it.<br />
&quot;How do I change back to me?&quot; Pete said to himself. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ve just got to think the reverse of transforming into a Komodo Dragon and back into myself.&quot;<br />
He lay still and thought deeply.<br />
Suddenly, he felt the now familiar sensations, pressures and bone-crunching which signalled his transformation into the Dragon except in reverse. His skull transformed into his human skull, his eyes returned to normal.  His arms and legs began to reshape themselves and appear by the side of his rapidly shrinking torso. His skin began to become human skin and his body hair began to grow out. His cock and balls popped out of his body and his gently dropped to the ground. And finally, in a reverse of the first transformation, his tail pulled itself back into his spine and the split in his skin closed up. He was human again.<br />
Being able to talk again, Pete said out aloud &quot;Well, those voices in my head were not wrong! I have the gift of transformation. It&#39;s amazing.&quot;<br />
Pete got dressed, looked around to see if there was anyone around and walked back to the car, still parked in the layby by the side of the main road. He got in, switched on the ignition and then realised just how long he&#39;d been asleep.<br />
&quot;Three days&quot; Pete gasped &quot;I can&#39;t believe that! But I guess that&#39;s what a Komodo Dragon would do in the wild. And I did want to experience the full transformation. It&#39;s just as well that I didn&#39;t have any work committments back home!&quot;<br />
Feeling very satisfied, he drove off and back to his home, his head was reeling with the posibilities of just what his next change was going to be.</p>
