<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie had given Timmy strict instructions not to open the door whilst he was out. He needed to go to some charity shops, to pick up some clothes for his big brother. Even though Timmy had told him there was no need, now he was a man with a great body he wanted to walk around naked, but Jamie was adamant that he was getting him some clothes. Timmy didn’t care anyway, it wasn’t like Jamie could make him wear anything. Timmy hadn’t paid any attention to his brother’s order not to open the door, but he was too dozy from whacking-off throughout the morning to get up. Timmy was just amazed at how good it felt, and how easy it was. Suddenly he couldn’t keep his mind off it, or any of the pretty ladies that were on the television. It was only after the bell had gone for a second time, and his curiosity got the better of him. As he swaggered downstairs, a new sensation hit him. He’d got annoyed before, but combined with the power and strength that was no swimming about in his blood and muscles, he actually felt like he could do something about it. Even if it was Jamie.<br />
<br />
It had been Tim’s idea to go to school. Jamie had been adamant that he was not ready, but Timmy refused to let himself be turned into a recluse and a freak by his brother. He was going to be treated like any other guy his ‘age.’ Getting an old school uniform from a thrift store, which was compulsory at Summer Bay High, that they were going to have to fit Timmy into, all Jamie’s shirts and trousers were a few sizes to small.  Jamie had to button up his collar for him, tuck in his shirt, and do his tie, but Timmy was uncharacteristically compliant as he let his brother dress him. Since the changes to his body, Jamie had noticed how Timmy was less and less willing to let himself do stuff for him. He wanted to feed himself, wash himself, look after himself. And he was like a bear with a sore head if Jamie tried to interfere. Jamie couldn’t help thinking how ridiculous it was. I mean, yes his brother now looked like a man but he was still, undoubtedly, a child inside. <br />
<br />
That was the reason for his main reservation of taking Timmy to school. Jamie knew firsthand the pressures of the schoolyard, and he worried for his delicate little brother, who could quite as easily become a target for the jock-bullies as he himself was. Timmy might come close to resembling a few of those football players, but that would only add to the confusion when they discovered his sensitive childlike nature underneath, and his refusal and inability to be treated like an adult. All his life, Jamie had vowed to protect Timmy from those sort of pressures he himself had to face, and now it was like he was pushing his brother straight into it. Still, knowing how excited and eager his brother was to be joining ‘big’ school, he tried to keep some of the fears to himself as he admired Timmy in his new uniform.<br />
<br />
“You look great” he smiled, then knowing how much it would please his worshiping little brother added “You look like me.”<br />
<br />
Timmy frowned. He’d been having a look at himself in the mirror, he thought he look a lot better than his older brother. <br />
<br />
“This collar’s too tight.”<br />
	<br />
“Leave that, you don’t want to look scruffy do you?”<br />
	<br />
“Is this how everyone else wears it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” Jamie lied. The school uniform at Summer Bay was largely treated with disgust and indifference. On the most part, it was either not worn at all, or its rules and conventions were openly flaunted - some of the brainless jocks didn’t even bother buttoning up their shirts at all, it seemed the scruffier and ‘sexier’ you looked the better. But Jamie didn’t want Timmy to be like that.<br />
<br />
“What are you looking forward to most about joining school?”<br />
<br />
“Um, I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“The lessons, and the classes?”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
	<br />
Jamie smiled, “You’ll like it.”<br />
<br />
Timmy smiled too, but more uncertainly. In his viewing of the different shows on t.v., people mostly talked about getting to know some of the other guys and fitting in. So he would have a few better role-models, he was really thinking about joining a few of the sport’s teams so he would be able to keep his fitness levels up. Timmy was even thinking more about the attractive girls there would be to fuck. But Jamie didn’t seem interested in any of that stuff, so it didn’t seem like he had to say anything to him .<br />
<br />
“Come on” said Jamie, smiling “Let’s go, bro.”&nbsp; <br />
	<br />
On the way to school, Jamie couldn't stop thinking about how much his little brother had changed in so short of a time. Unlike his usual talkative self, he was mostly quiet on the way there, speaking only to answer his former older brother's questions.<br />
<br />
Timmy could tell something was bothering Jamie. At first he didn't really care WHAT his older brother did or said, but after a few minutes of watching, his curiosity got the better of him. He, finally three blocks from school, looked over at Jaime and stopped, &quot;Bro. What's up? Why are you so down today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie sighed, thinking, (Could he really be that dense now?...maybe..) He looked over at Tim and surprised even himself at how emotional his voice was, &quot;Bro..I...&quot; He choked and looks away, forcing himself to calm down. He looked back and cleared his throat a little embarrassedly. &quot;Timmy... That pill's doing more than changing your body. You're acting different, talking different...you don't...you don't even seem to care what I say now...&quot; He sighed and sat down on the stoop of a porch to one of the many apartments in the area. &quot;I miss my little brother. The one...who cared what I said. The one who...The one who...NEEDED me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timmy blinked. He'd never seen his brother so this way. He was both embarrassed and intrigued. (He acts like he needed me as much I need, USED to need..him. Maybe he's right...maybe this is...going too far...but it FEELS so RIGHT...) Timmy sat down next to his brother, not meeting his eyes, &quot;I don't know what to say, Jamie. It's not like I'm going to start hating you cause I'm bigger now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie sighed, &quot;Bro, you don't understand. The pressure of being this old. You were the only one I could talk to...and didn't care whether I was brilliant or dumb or if I made a big goof in school. You were my little brother. I looked out after you...now... you're wanting to do things YOUR way....Guess...I wasn't ready to let you grow up so soon...To..not be needed anymore...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie sighed, &quot;Bro, you don't understand. The pressure of being this old. You were the only one I could talk to...and didn't care whether I was brilliant or dumb or if I made a big goof in school. You were my little brother. I looked out after you...now... you're wanting to do things YOUR way....Guess...I wasn't ready to let you grow up so soon...To..not be needed anymore...&quot;<br />
<br />
Timmy just grinned and said quietly, &quot;I think you'll understand far too soon, LITTLE brother.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Timmy had never seen anything like it before in his life. At the quiet Elementary school he had attended until Friday, things happened a lot differently. As he followed his brother through the school gates of Summer Bay High, Timmy was amazed at the noise, the chaos, the sight of so many people. He was not attuned to the rowdy, unruly behavior that surrounded him as he followed Jamie through the yard. Big kids, they seemed to resemble hardened adults more than they did innocent children: laughing, shouting, smoking, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. It was almost scary. And no one seemed to be dressed like he and his brother. As Timmy looked around at the other guys, he saw they were wearing wife-beaters, open shirts, tight t-shirts, showing off rippling muscles. And on the few occasions a uniform was worn, it was disheveled, untidy and unbuttoned. The rule seemed to be that you showed off as much flesh as possible. Timmy’s large left hand sub-consciously reached for the knot of his tie, fastened tightly around his throat, as if to pull it loose. It felt unnatural to be cooped up in a uniform like this, especially when everyone else seemed to be dressed so wildly differently. The only thing he liked about the uniform was it’s strong, masculine, scent – an obvious remnant of it’s previous owner. <br />
<br />
Jamie looked back at his brother and smiled hesitantly. Timmy could tell that he didn’t fit in here – he wasn’t like any of these guys, and his whole demeanor seemed to have changed the moment they left the house – quieter, quicker, nervier.<br />
<br />
And the girls! Often dressed in short skirts, low fitting tops, they seemed to be really friendly with some of the guys. They were all so….hot, Timmy couldn’t keep his eyes off them. As he feasted his eyes on the proud display of naked flesh, a cheeky smile seemed to spread across his handsome face. He caught eye-contact with one of the girls, and felt her give him a similarly appreciating glance back in his direction. In his pants, his big snake began to stir. He wanted to reach for it right now and jack off, but one of the things Jamie had tried to teach him that he couldn’t just satisfy his sexual desires whenever he pleased – especially not in public. But what else was he supposed to do?<br />
<br />
They’d reached the doors of the school building – and as Jamie and Timmy walked inside, Timmy watched his brother visibly take a sigh of relief. He seemed to be more scared of the intimidating sights of the playground than Timmy had been. His brother could be such a dork sometimes.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked up, concerned: “Are you okay?” and Timmy felt vibes of irritation seethe through. He’d found it a little scary at first, but he wasn’t about to admit to that. It was a scene he felt he could belong to, as one of the handsome guys in a vest-top, being fawned over by a beautiful girl. His brother’s attitude was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
“Yeah” he answered, in sullen, almost cocky tones which seemed to create a sense of unease in Jamie.<br />
<br />
“Okay then” and he smiled hesitantly again. “Let’s go and find that School administrator. Remember, while you’re here you’re Scott Parker: my cousin, over from New Jersey.<br />
<br />
‘Scott’ nodded silently. Maybe he didn’t even have to be Jamie’s cousin – it’s not as if they looked similar. He wasn’t sure that being connected to someone as small and spineless as Jamie would be such an advantage among his new classmates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The day went past in a blur. New people, new places, new experiences, new self. Scott Parker, fresh from New Jersey to stay with his cousin Jamie Parker. As he had been introduced to his class, Timmy had felt the admiring glances of his classmates. Girls who had been chatting disinterestedly as he walked into the class were now propped up and paying attention. Scott smiled warmly back. The jocks at the back of the classroom were sizing the new kid out. He looked like he had a good body, might be a decent player on the football pitch. The girls liked the look of his body too. Scott felt acknowledged and accepted, albeit tentatively. He just wished that he wasn’t wearing this stupid uniform. The guys at the back of the class looked so cool and Scott just felt like a big dork. At least they hadn’t placed him in Jamie’s class. <br />
<br />
By the end of the day his tie and blazer were gone. His shirt untucked and unbuttoned so that a slither of his beautiful hairless physique was on show underneath. As he walked over to his brother, standing waiting for him at the school gates at the end of the day, a couple of his new buddies walked with him. They wanted him to hang around for the practice after school, introduce him to coach.<br />
	<br />
Jamie looked over anxiously. He recognized a few of the guys Timmy was with. They’d been in the gang that had chased him to the locker room only a few days ago. Timmy’s speech to his little brother was quick and blunt. He didn’t want to say anything which would show him up in front of his new friends.<br />
	<br />
“I’m hanging around school. Going to football practice.”<br />
	<br />
His new jock friends kept their distance behind, so that what Timmy’s words remained just out of hearing. But Jamie couldn’t help feeling intimidated by their presence as they laughed loudly over a shared joke, probably at his expense.<br />
	<br />
“Timmy, you can’t. You have to go home now, and you can’t walk back on your own.”<br />
	<br />
“Why not?”<br />
	<br />
“It’s dangerous.”<br />
	<br />
“I’m not a little kid anymore.” Jamie found it hard to argue with that, but he did.<br />
	<br />
“Yes, you are Timmy. These changes, they're not real. It's not the real you&quot;<br />
	<br />
“Fuck off Jamie.”<br />
	<br />
Jamie didn’t even know where Timmy had learned language like that. It shocked him to hear it, somehow he still expected his little brother to act like the sweet little boy he had been a few days ago. Now there was a hardness and an edge about him as he defied his older brother.<br />
	<br />
Suddenly the jocks were around the pair. “What’s the hold up man? What you wasting your time on this little shit for?”<br />
	<br />
“He’s my cousin.”<br />
	<br />
“Man.”<br />
	<br />
Jamie was virtually trembling in fear, but he knew he couldn’t let Timmy hang around with these dumb assholes much longer. He started to raise a final objection, “Timmy…”<br />
	<br />
But one of the jocks cut him short “Fuck off little squirt. Scott, our main man here is coming to football practice with us. Why don’t you run off and do your homework like a good little queer.” More laughter. Timmy didn’t say a word, but there might have been a smidgen of a smile forming on his full handsome lips.</p>
