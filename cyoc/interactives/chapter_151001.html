<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff did not want to wait a full 24 hours to turn into a donkey, then remain a donkey for another 24 hours. So, he decided on the instantaneous option.<br />
<br />
He wanted to be a full-grown jack, and chose that as his next option.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the settings, he clicked &quot;save,&quot; and immediately he felt a shock hit his entire body and he sorta &quot;blacked out&quot; for a moment. His vision quickly &quot;cleared.&quot; Or, what can pass as &quot;clear vision.&quot; Jeff had perfect 20/20 eyesight as a human. But as a donkey, everything was in shades of gray. He was also very near-sighted with blurry vision. However, his hearing was exceptional. He quickly noticed just how loud the buzzing from the chronovac machine really was. He could hear a dog barking down the street with his bedroom window closed that he never noticed as a human. Someone was cutting grass behind his house. Those were the very first things he noticed.<br />
<br />
As for his vision being blurry, it was quite bothersome. He went to lift his right hand to get the cobwebbies out of his eyes. He barely got his right foreleg off the ground, when he noticed he was standing on all fours, and that his &quot;hand&quot; ended in a solid hoof meant only for standing, walking, or running with.<br />
<br />
He swung his now heavy head attached to a very long neck around to get a look at his body. Yup. He was a donkey alright! He could see the large rump extending pretty far back behind him and noticed his tail for the first time! What a strange sensation, as his tail started to move somewhat involuntarily.<br />
<br />
He started experimenting with his new legs. It was strange to be on all fours, but quite comfortable. He tried standing up on his back two legs, but quickly fell back down onto his new front legs. &quot;I guess I&#39;m locked in this position now,&quot; he said. Or tried to say. &quot;Hee haww hee haww,&quot; was all he was able to manage. He just brayed like the jackass he now is, instead of spoken like the human he once was! &quot;Damn,&quot; he thought. &quot;I can&#39;t wipe at my eyes!&quot; &quot;Haawwww heerrrrrr hawwwww heerrr aawww!!!!* &quot;I can&#39;t speak either!&quot; &quot;Eerrrrrr hhhhaaaaaawwww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He thought &quot;I&#39;ll just shut my mouth, rather than make all of this embarrassing commotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wanted to take a look at himself in the mirror. That&#39;s when he finally noticed he wasn&#39;t looking completely straight ahead. His eyeballs are set kind of wide apart and somewhat on the side of his head. It took him this long to notice that, as he couldn&#39;t see really well to begin with.<br />
<br />
Irritated with his sloppy eyesight, he shrugged his shoulders and soldiered on. Well, he tried to shrug his shoulders anyway. But his physiology made that awkward. In any case, he decided to check himself out in his full body closet mirror. He found he&#39;s beginning to be able to move efficiently with this clumsy body and so, made his way to his mirror.<br />
<br />
Approaching from the front, he rembered he has a large blind spot straight ahead. He had to tilt his head to the side. He turned his body slightly to the side as well, in order to check himself out in the mirror as best he could. The result was seeing a typical gray-furred African-style donkey&#39;s head, neck, and tall ears instead of his own face! This slightly turned him on, as his new large equine donkey penis began to slide from it&#39;s new uncut home.<br />
<br />
He then got to feeling his new, large, blocky slab-like teeth with his sour new donkey tongue. He opened his mouth, and found he could move his large, thick, rubbery donkey lips up and out of the way. Because he chose to be a full-grown jack, he was a middle-aged donkey. And so, his teeth were severely yellowed; almost black between the cracks. All he was able to see of them, was mostly dark-looking blocks that blended together. Having no idea his teeth were in the beginning stages of rotting. This was causing the sour taste in his mouth, and to a human, disgusting smelling breath.<br />
<br />
The lack of being able to see his teeth and thinking about possessing a donkey tongue, turned him on even more. His large black jackass of a penis coming more at attention. He instinctively went to grab it with his left hand. But alas, he has legs instead of arms. Hooves instead of hands. Which turned him on even further! Knowing now how restrictive hooves are in place of nimble human fingers, he had a sense of his hands being constricted. He could not spread his fingers! They were now nothing but large blocky hooves, and will remain that way for the next 23 and a half hours!<br />
<br />
This new discovery and realization brought on a whole new set of emotions and sensations. All at once he became scared; agitated with the feeling of being &quot;stuck&quot; and outright horny! He then began to notice how warm it was in his room. He couldn&#39;t take off his thick gray fur. He was stuck with it! Just like he was stuck with useless hooves that were unable to grasp his engorging penis!<br />
<br />
Feeling the frustration building, he began to snort. Followed by a light Hawing noise as he breathed out. He attempted to say &quot;oh fuck,&quot; but let out a full-on bray instead! Heeerrr Haaww!! He tried to speak again. And again, all he could was bray! He can&#39;t talk, he realized for the second time! He is now entering into a state of a full-blown hardon! More intense and frustrating than any hard-on he&#39;s ever felt in his young life as a boy!<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes and desperately wishing himself back to his old human self with his beautiful boy hands instead of these useless clumsy hooves that has him feeling entirely too entrapped, his very large beer-can-thick, meter-long middle-aged black jackass penis began dancing up and down. He felt his balls churning. He had to do something! He was desperate!</p>
