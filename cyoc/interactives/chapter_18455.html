<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter was reading through the classifieds section of the newspaper, when a small display ad had caught his attention.<br />
<br />
“Summer Special: $15 per month for the first six months – gym membership at Samson’s Gym – for new members and beginners only – Sign up today only – Expires at 6PM tonight!”<br />
<br />
“Whoa! What a great deal! I had better go there and sign up!” Peter thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Peter put on a tank top, shorts, and basketball shoes before he headed out the door. He jumped on his bicycle, and pedaled his way to the gym.<br />
<br />
As soon as he arrived, he locked his bike to the bike rack using his padlock, and he walked in. he strolled around the gym for a few minutes, before he walked back to the front desk and patiently waited his turn so he could talk to the manager, who was working behind the front desk.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter heard Allen’s voice speaking inside of his body.<br />
<br />
“Peter… What’s going on? Why are you in this gym?” Allen’s voice asked him.<br />
<br />
“They had a special today, and I figured I’d sign up for a membership!” Peter whispered. He spoke in a soft voice, so that others wouldn’t stare at him and wonder why he was talking to himself.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need a gym membership when I can grow your muscles every day! Besides, this place is a rip off! They’re going to make you sign a one-year contract! Don’t do it!” Allen’s voice rang inside of him.<br />
<br />
But it was too late. Gordon, the manager had already spotted Peter sitting on a bar stool by the front counter.<br />
<br />
“You’re here for the special? Ahh, yes, you look like a beginner. Fill out this form and sign here!” Gordon said, as he handed peter a clipboard with several pages of forms.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the phone rang, and Gordon turned around to answer the phone.<br />
<br />
“I want your biceps to inflate with muscle!” Allen commanded.<br />
<br />
As soon as Gordon had turned his back towards Peter, he began to feel a tingle in his arms.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh…” Peter whispered. “Oh no… Not now… Allen! Don’t do this now!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s arms began to thicken. Allen had sent his commands to Peter’s body, which had obeyed them immediately. <br />
<br />
His biceps started to vibrate a little, and Peter felt it! They began to swell as they slowly expanded and grew to the size of bowling balls!<br />
<br />
Right at the moment, when Gordon turned around to face Peter, the growth stopped.<br />
<br />
“So, Monsieur Karlowski, would you like the one-year membership or the two-year member…”<br />
<br />
Gordon froze, when he noticed that Peter’s arms looked a lot thicker than they were a few moments ago.<br />
<br />
Peter just stared at him, feeling a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“I see; you’ve worked out your arms before, eh?” Gordon quipped.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… well… My arms tend to grow a little now and then… They just grow by themselves!” Peter responded shyly.<br />
<br />
“Your biceps just grow by themselves? Ahhaaahh…” Gordon said. He was a little skeptical about Peter’s “beginner” status as a body builder. “Okaaaayyyy…”<br />
<br />
The telephone rang again.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me!” Gordon said. He turned around to answer the call.<br />
<br />
As soon as Gordon had his back towards Peter, Peter was suddenly overcome by a rumbling noise inside of him.<br />
<br />
“I command your pecs to grow” Allen’s voice said.<br />
<br />
“Allen! No! Please!” Peter pleaded. <br />
<br />
But it was too late!<br />
<br />
His pectorals inflated dramatically, filling out his tank top just before it got stretched to the limit! Two giant spheres of muscle were now sticking out almost 6 inches from his chest!<br />
<br />
Gordon hung up and turned around.<br />
<br />
“Please remember to sign on page 1, 2, 3, and 5 so that we can check your credit history and your employment…”<br />
<br />
Gordon gasped when he noticed Peter’s inflated pectorals.<br />
<br />
“Good God!” he said. He was amazed when he saw how big Peter’s pecs had become.<br />
<br />
Gordon stared at Peter’s body for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you’re just a beginner? You don’t look like a beginner to me!” he said in a stern voice.<br />
<br />
“I’m a beginner! I swear! I can explain! My muscles just grow by themselves! My friend Allen has the power over all my muscles and he can make them as big as he wants to! He just thinks about muscle, and my muscles start to grow! You gotta believe me!” Peter pleaded with the gym’s manager. “I haven’t worked out in over a year! Allen just makes me grow whenever he wants to. He can control my body! Honest!”<br />
<br />
“Riiiiiight….” Gordon replied. He tapped his finger on the table’s surface. <br />
<br />
“I’m not pulling your leg! You gotta believe me!” Peter continued.<br />
<br />
The phone rang again.<br />
<br />
Gordon turned around and answered the phone.<br />
<br />
For the moment, Peter breathed a sigh of relief, until he felt a vibration in his pecs and a rumbling sound, which was coming from inside of his chest.<br />
<br />
“Uh ooohhhh…” he said to himself. “Oh no… Not again! NO!”<br />
<br />
Allen’s powerful magic began to affect his muscles for the third time!<br />
<br />
“You can’t stop me from making you as big as I want! Because you didn’t believe me, I’m gonna make you grow outrageously huge every day for the rest of this week! Here goes. Happy growing, Peter! I’m gonna blow you up!”<br />
<br />
Peter gasped!<br />
<br />
The pecs began to inflate even more, pressing the fabric of his tank top even further, until the stress on the cotton was too great. Suddenly, his tank top ripped in half, with the rip going straight vertically from the collar down to the waist.<br />
<br />
Rrrrriiipppppp!<br />
<br />
Gordon had hung up the phone, and he turned to face Peter.<br />
<br />
Gordon found himself staring at Peter’s giant pectorals, which were sticking out almost a foot from his chest. Pieces of the ripped tank top were hanging from the sides.<br />
<br />
Gordon quickly grabbed the unsigned contract, and ripped all five pages in half, before tossing it in the trash can!<br />
<br />
“Mister Karlowski, I’m sorry to tell you that you don’t qualify for the special deal. However, I can offer you our regular membership, which has a monthly fee of $29.75 per month. Would you like to sign up for that?” he asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“Uhhh….” Peter said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter felt his arms and pecs vibrate a little more, as his shoulders grew an inch wider!<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll pass…”<br />
<br />
“Thank you. Please come again. We’ll have other special deals coming up around Christmas time… Next!” Gordon said, as he turned to help the person who was standing behind Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter stood up and walked out the door, feeling sad that he had missed out on the gym membership.<br />
<br />
As soon as he was standing by the bike rack, outside the gym, his pectorals and biceps deflated until they were the normal size once again.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need a gym membership” Peter heard Allen say to him. “You got ME! I’m your gym! I can make you bigger than their biggest bodybuilder! I can make you grow bigger and wider than the whole building, if I wanted to! So, save your money, Peter!”<br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right. Gee, thanks for looking out after me, Allen…”<br />
<br />
“Peter, I can make you grow bigger then this entire building! In fact, I can make you grow to over 100 feet tall! There is no limit to how big I can make you. Just consider yourself lucky. So, get on your bike, and go home!” Allen ordered.<br />
<br />
Peter unlocked his padlock from the bike rack.<br />
<br />
He was about to hop on the bike, when he felt a tingle in his legs.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his calves swelled up, until it almost seemed like he had muscles the size of melons, which were sticking out from the back of his legs.<br />
<br />
“Look at those babies! You got super calves, Peter! There ya go. Pedaling home will be a piece of cake with those monster muscles!” Allen laughed inside of Peter’s head.<br />
<br />
Peter just smiled as he mounted his bike. Pedaling home was a breeze, with his new, super-charged calves, which Allen had given him cheerfully.<br />
<br />
When would Allen make him grow next?</p>
