<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chenoa smiled smugly, settling into her seat as she gazed at her peers. With the exception Travis and Ms. McKinnon it seemed everyone was happy. Finally feeling comfortable, the Deer girl settled in to study her newly transformed classmates. <br />
<br />
A feeling of guilt now began to wash over her as she watched Travis. The teen was catching an earful from Stephanie and still rubbing the sore spots from where she and Stephanie had struck him. Cloaked in his robe of living shadows, Chenoa now noticed for the first time the expression on his face. Travis looked heart broken.<br />
<br />
This confused Chenoa, why would he be so upset? Did he have something against animals? Maybe he wasn&#39;t a good match for Stephanie after all. Thinking it over though, she realized that wasn&#39;t it at all. &quot;I just want to be normal.&quot; Those were the words spoken by Travis quite frequently. At first Chenoa thought this meant Travis wished for the mundane, the non magical, something human. Slowly it dawned on her what that meant.<br />
<br />
Magic and change didn&#39;t bother Travis, he could deal with that. What he wanted though was friends. People he could trust, people that wouldn&#39;t view him as a freak, people who even if things changed wouldn&#39;t treat him differently. Things people saw as normal and took for granted. Chenoa, in her own way, now realized Travis&#39;s fears had become reality.<br />
<br />
Stephanie didn&#39;t know abou the spell, only a few did. What Stephanie took as an insult was just Travis showing concern for her well being. His kindness though had been turned on him and two of the most important people in his life had attacked him for it. Travis felt betrayed, hurt, for something he had no control over. Chenoa&#39;s eyes now began to dampen with tears, she may be more comfortable but she had hurt someone in the process.<br />
<br />
************************<br />
<br />
As Goldie now sprang from the nearby woods, she could clearly see Chenoa&#39;s school. Even at a distance she could feel the shaman magic radiating from the building. Obviously Chenoa would need to be trained, if her powers went unchecked she could cause serious harm. As Goldie now made her way towards the entrance, she paused as she saw two figures standing in the parking lot of the school. Curiously she now approached, wondering who they could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hello,&quot; a woman said happily as Goldie approached. Goldie smiled, offering a polite wave of her own as she neared the strangers. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said, quickly trying to formulate a cover story to explain why she was at the school. &quot;I take it your kid forgot something at home today too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No not exactly Goldie,&quot; the man said. Goldie paused, she hadn&#39;t said her name? How did they know who she was? &quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse my husband,&quot; the woman apologized, noting the look of confusionon Goldies face. &quot;He far too often forgets to introduce himself. I&#39;m Life and this is my husband death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie balked. As an immortal forest guardian she was well aware of the personification of Life and Death, she just never thought she would meet them. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;So I guess there&#39;s no reason to be coy. You felt the shaman magic as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until we arrived,&quot; Death stated. &quot;Although I must say, your goddaughter is quite powerful to generate such a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We came because of our son,&quot; Life continued. &quot;We felt his emotions from home. Something upset him and we just wanted to check in and make sure everything is alright. By the way, how are you and Bear doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t be happier,&quot; Goldie replied, still taken aback to be face to face with a pair of primordial beings. &quot;But, enough about me. I felt Chenoa&#39;s magic from my home, I hadn&#39;t realized just how powerful she was. I came to talk with her and hopefully settle things down. Afterwards though, I&#39;m going to need to train her so she can control her abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A splendid idea,&quot; Death smiled. &quot;Would you mind if we accompanied you. We just want to check on our son.&quot; Goldie nodded, the three immortal beings now making their way towards the school.<br />
<br />
Chenoa was feeling depressed as she watched Travis and Stephanie. Travis&#39;s head was hanging low as Stephanie continued to berate him.  Apparently Travis&#39;s own abilities affecting those around him as well as Chenoa. The Deer girl noticing several angry or upset people near the teen. Anthro teenagers now crying softly or frowning in anger as they glared at Stephanie and Travis. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Chenoa whimpered as she wiped her eyes. A voice over the schools P.A. system now drew her  attention, why was she being called to the front lobby? Quickly standing she cast a sad expression towards Travis and Stephanie before making her way to the front lobby.<br />
<br />
As Chenoa emerged from the auditorium, she now gasped as she saw her godmother. &quot;Goldie,&quot; she cried racing towards the woman. Leaping into her arms, the Deer girl now began to sob as she explained everything that happened. &quot;Its okay,&quot; Goldie soothed, brushing the Deer girls fur. &quot;Accidents happen. No one realized you had so much potential in you as a shaman.&quot; Chenoa nodded, Goldie wiping tears from the girls eyes as she looked to the two people standing with Goldie. &quot;Godmother who are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re Travis&#39;s parents,&quot; Death replied, offering a small smile. Chenoa paled slightly, she knew about Travis&#39;s heritage, she just never expected to see them. As they explained they had come when they felt their sons sadness, a feeling of dread began to churn in the pit of Chenoa&#39;s stomach. &quot;You have nothing to fear Chenoa,&quot; Life said softly. &quot;We just wanted to make sure Travis is okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s upset,&quot; Chenoa sniffed. &quot;And I think it&#39;s my fault. Goldie I&#39;m so sorry! I just felt so out of place, I didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn&#39;t,&quot; Goldie said softly, offering her goddaughter a reassuring smile. &quot;But, we have to fix this and I&#39;m going to need your help.&quot; Chenoa nodded, wiping her cheeks as she stood before Goldie. &quot;What do I need to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus,&quot; Goldie stated, taking the Deer girls hand. &quot;Feel the magic of nature flow through you. Together we will shape the natural world as it once was.&quot; Chenoa nodded, furrowing her brow as she began to concentrate. It was difficult, the girl reaching out throughout the school as she looked to reverse the changes, to set back everything to how it was. <br />
<br />
Peaking into the auditorium, Life and Death now noticed everyone changing back. In only seconds where a room full of anthro teenagers and teachers had been was fully human once again. &quot;That was quicker than I expected,&quot; Life said in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but I hadn&#39;t even completed the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Life and Death paused, casting an anxious look at both Goldie and Chenoa. &quot;Its true,&quot; Goldie said with concern. &quot;We had just started. We&#39;re not the ones who ended the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you didn&#39;t,&quot; Death asked. &quot;Who did?&quot;<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
Out in the parking lot, a teenage boy of eighteen now entered his car before pulling out his cellphone. Still not used to this archaic technology, it took him a moment to dial. &quot;Rick my boy how was your first day of the school,&quot; the voice on the other end replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its barely started and it&#39;s already been interesting,&quot; Rick replied. &quot;You were right Boss. This is definitely the place those wizards called home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you kid,&quot; the Boss said happily. &quot;And let me guess some shenanigans took place.&quot; Rick simply answers yes, explaining quickly how he had observed the entire school transform into anthro animals before he cast a counter spell putting everyone back to normal. &quot;And here I thought you didn&#39;t pay attention to mine and Morgan&#39;s lessons,&quot; the Boss laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did notice a couple things you might find interesting,&quot; Rick stated. &quot;Two teens, probably 16 years old. One of them was cloaked in living shadows, the other was a Native American girl. I think she might be a shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chenoa and Travis,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;Makes sense. I had that Soul Drive Alpha download everything on the wizards before we jumped to the past. Those two, way stronger than anyone ever gave them credit for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want their power!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In due time Rick,&quot; the Boss laughed. &quot;You&#39;re still learning that soul drain spell. Soon enough you&#39;ll make your move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Catalyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s 80 years in the future Rick,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;And by the time they figure out what&#39;s going on we&#39;ll have already changed the timeline. Now, you&#39;ve done enough, come on home. Casseus and I will use our magic to cover up any knowledge of you witnessing what happened and we&#39;ve got the tech to make it seem like you went home sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded, hanging up the phone as he turned his car on, the teen grinning as the internal combustion engine roared to life. &quot;They certainly don&#39;t make these in the future,&quot; he said, pulling out of the parking lot. If his first day of high school in the past had been this interesting, he was looking forward to what the rest of the year had to offer.</p>
