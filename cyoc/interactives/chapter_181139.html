<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon decided his elephant changes weren&#39;t very far along and he could easily go out on the town without anyone noticing his animal parts. In reality, his sheath created a massive bulge at the front, and the outline of his tail could easily be seen stretching the fabric of his pants whenever it tried to move. But they, he was fully clothed and superficially human, so why shouldn&#39;t he go clubbing?<br />
<br />
He was a bit that he now had to go clean up the elephant-sized mess he&#39;d made in the bathroom, but that orgasm was worth it. Once the floor was clean, he grabbed his keys and went out. He stood up on the bus so he wouldn&#39;t have to sit on his tail, and he couldn&#39;t really see the funny looks from other riders behind him. He was pumped when the bus pulled into his favorite nightclub, the Neata Rita. He went in and danced and got himself tipsy and popped some molly before dancing some more. This place was the best! He found some hot girls to hit on, but it was hard to stay with any of them very long because his prehensile dick would grow up into his shirt and start squirming against his chest. Other dancers warned him to stay away from the bouncers because pets weren&#39;t allowed in the club, saying they didn&#39;t even want to know what he had smuggled in but they were going to dance elsewhere in case he got caught. But poor Damon couldn&#39;t get rid of his &quot;pet&quot;! He just had to try to keep his mind off the sexy and keep his schlong tucked up inside him as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Eventually his beers started to go through him and he had to excuse himself to the restroom. At least it was okay to have his dick out in here, even if it was gigantic, or so he thought. How hard can it be to aim when your dick is like an RV sewer hose? Unfortunately Damon didn&#39;t have any experience with how elephants pee, so it took him completely by surprise when his unsheathed penis curled itself under him and started dumping his urine out backwards onto the floor. It was like a waterfall back there! It was too unfamiliar and too much of a relief for him to stop, but it was so embarrassing he desperately hoped no one else would come in and see him. Unfortunately, in a crowed speakeasy, this was not to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; some young shouted on opening the door and seeing the nasty river gushing out between Damon&#39;s feet. He had no idea what to think of the unseemly gray hose pointing out behind Damon. Damon knew the man was probably going to go get the nightclub staff and that he was going to be kicked out in a humiliating seen if he stuck around, so he quickly finished up, resheathed his outlet and waded out of the bathroom through his swamp of piss. He saw someone in a uniform hurrying into the bathroom, but he just kept his head down, sneaking out a back door into the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with me?&quot; he thought, sulking home on foot through the dimly lit streets back toward his home. &quot;How can having an animal dick be worth what I&#39;m putting up with from it? I&#39;m not even human anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
But the thought of all the hotties he could have been banging if he still had his human penis, and the thought of just how much bigger he was down there than any man on the planet, soon had Damon&#39;s internal testicles burning with lust and also had his mammoth member probing around under his shirt, almost up to the collar. Damon&#39;s buzzed mind thought wrestling his whale just one more time might not be such a bad idea. &quot;At least I might be able to walk home without blueballs,&quot; he thought, turning off into a dark alley away from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
Waving his elephant dick around in the night air seemed to make his troubles melt away. He didn&#39;t want to admit that waving his tail around freely was really helping a lot too. He got to work with both hands again like he did the first time. He was just about to start sucking himself off again when the next side effect caught him by surprise. It was like his nose simply, and for no apparent reason, simply unrolled. One moment he was taking deep breaths in and out of his regular nose without thinking, and the next moment a tremendous amount of new skin was flapping against his legs and he was breathing through a long column of flesh even bigger than his cock. He let go of his penis so he could reorient himself and deal with this new problem.<br />
<br />
Damon was finally used to having two things on his body he could control that other humans couldn&#39;t. But this new growth was more dexterous than his cock, much more so than his tail. He tried out the new muscles in his nose as best he could, waving its length in front of him and curling it up and down. It was hard to see what his new appendage was doing, but his eyes had adjusted to the darkness somewhat. He scratched his belly with the delicate tip of his new trunk, marveling at the detailed coordination he had in it. Even though he couldn&#39;t entirely see what his nose looked like now, there was no question in his mind that he obviously had an elephant&#39;s trunk, something that there was no way he could hide with his current outfit. Trying to enjoy what an elephant has while remaining human wasn&#39;t really working out for Damon. He was still much too horny to reflect much on his worsening predicament right now, though. He had too versatile appendages snaking around in front of him, and one of them was desperately calling for his attention. His new trunk might be the only good thing that&#39;s happened to him since the club.<br />
<br />
Gripping his dick again with both hands, Damon carefully maneuvered his nose and wrapped his trunk around the upper half, grimacing in pleasure as his trunk tickled areas with its tentacle-like length that made him shudder. He knew he couldn&#39;t last much longer with his dick in his trunk like this, so he braced for the impending flood. Aiming his dick forward over the nearby dumpster, he felt powerful muscles shoving his juices all the way up his massive shaft and heard the tell-tale splashes that confirmed his ejaculatory prowess. Orgasms sure were messy with his new arrangement, but at least this mess wouldn&#39;t be his problem. In the throes of climax, Damon raised his trunk up off of his dick and made a funny noise through it, and noise he recognized in hindsight as an elephant&#39;s trumpet. He hoped it wouldn&#39;t draw too much attention to him.<br />
<br />
As his body was finally starting to relax, a pressure surged through his upper mouth, and bony hardness emerged on either side of his face&#39;s connection to his trunk. Not even bothering with his hands, Damon felt at the protrusions with his trunk. They were hard and curvy. Startled, Damon eventually did start exploring the things with his hands, feeling their smooth texture and their sharp points. Feeling them all the way back up into this mouth, there was no mistaking the fact that these were just really large outgrowths of two particular teeth.<br />
<br />
&#39;TWO changes?&#39; he thought. &#39;I pleasure myself ONE more time but I get TWO more changes? I&#39;ve got a trunk and tusks! Last time, I only got a tail!&#39; He struggled to get his pants back on because it turned out he was even taller and had wider legs now, and there was absolutely no way his shirt was going to fit on over his tusks. &#39;Wait, what was I thinking? ONLY a tail? Even a tail was too much! If I keep doing this, I&#39;ll be in a zoo before much longer!&#39; It wasn&#39;t going to be easy to get home without being seen. But if he could make it back in one piece, he silently promised himself he&#39;d wish him back to normal as soon as he got there! ... Well, maybe not literally that second, after all there was a lot he could try to do with his new trunk since it was basically like having a third arm. But as long as he didn&#39;t try to do THAT again, he would still be human enough to make that all-important wish and get his humanity back sooner rather than later!</p>
