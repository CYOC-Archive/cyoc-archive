<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dad&#39;s POV<br />
<br />
Although I wasn&#39;t feeling that hungry, I was still scheduled to eat breakfast around this time. It was weird how my appetite has severely went down since the experiment began. Back then I was able to gobble up thrice the amount of food that I can eat now and it&#39;s only been day four. The results of the procedure&#39;s diet has been very effective though since I am almost the size of David when we first started this experiment.<br />
<br />
In the table at the center of the cafeteria I saw a man who seems to be in his early thirties. His face was familiar but the features that made him distinct as David was gone. His eyes were a lot brighter than what he started with and his salt and pepper hair was coming up nicely. Some brown streaks remained but just like my leftover greys, they seem more like a stylistic highlight than anything else. It was also quite obvious that his facial hair was growing at a fast rate. It wasn&#39;t a beard yet but it was a nice growth of black and some grey, similar to how it will look like when a middle-age man shaved just two days ago and his facial hair is starting to regrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up dad&quot; he said in a voice that was a lot deeper and manlier than how a teenager should sound like. I laughed a bit when he called me dad, perhaps it&#39;s because for all intents and purposes, he&#39;s not a teenager anymore. He looks like a man in his 30&#39;s calling a more diminutive guy his dad. Genetically he&#39;s a lot more &quot;Frank&quot; than he is &quot;David&quot; and I guess that makes me a lot more like my son than myself days ago. <br />
<br />
It was mortifying to think about but I completely knew what we signed up for. I feel like I should be a lot happier to be reclaiming more than two decades of my life back, but it wasn&#39;t my life anymore. I was not going to age back as a teenage version of myself but rather live out my life as my son for the rest of my life. It was a daunting realization but it was also turning me on. I&#39;ve always had this sick fantasy of living someone else&#39;s life but I thought it was all just a fantasy, but now this is it. I did not expect it to be with my son though. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think from now on, I should be calling you dad and you should be calling me David&quot;  I said as he was stuffing his mouth with three pieces of eggs, two hefty slices of bacon, and five slices of toast with butter. His appetite really has grown immensely especially comparing our meals with each other. In my plate is just a single toast with no butter, and a hard boiled egg. Despite this minuscule serving, I still feel extremely full. I don&#39;t know if they put something in our drinks but everytime I eat, I always feel like running to the restroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Suits me...David&quot; he said. It still feels weird, here I am referring to a man who was once a product of my sperm. My offspring, my child, and now my dad. It was so messed up but I also feel very satisfied calling him that. I did not have the best relationship with my own father so maybe having my former son act as my father would end up being better. <br />
<br />
After eating, we were lead to the gym where different workouts were assigned to us fitting our newer bodies. For me, it was a lot more cardio and some light weights to tone my body. I was wearing a loose shirt and some jogging pants while he was geared up with a wife beater and some compression shorts. I&#39;ve always been a bit hairy and it seems like it&#39;s reflecting on his body now as well. His pits were bushy and it&#39;s turning me on a bit looking at how much he has developed to look like my old self. It&#39;s still not a complete replica but he&#39;s looking a lot like me even in how he moves in the gym. His grunts and even his face when he&#39;s pushing himself in lifting heavy weights were all identical to how I used to look like. It was eerie and I wondered, how much of my movements and mannerisms were David&#39;s and how much of my original self remained? <br />
<br />
Our exercise regimen has always been different with mine being more focused on cardio and him being more with weights. We were also given these workout shakes that I could only imagine what&#39;s in them. Maybe it&#39;s whats making me sweat so much as if I&#39;m in the sauna even if I&#39;m just running at low speed at the treadmill and it might also be the one that&#39;s allowing him to work out three hours straight.<br />
<br />
After our workouts, we both took a shower together. Before the experiment, I would be conscious being seen by my son naked, but considering that this is his body and what I&#39;m looking at when I see him is my old body, I feel a lot less conscious about it. Inside the shower, while we&#39;re not saying anything, we both know that we&#39;re checking our bodies out. From our heads to our toes, we are inspecting how much our bodies have changed. <br />
<br />
The difference in height was the most obvious since when he came in here, he was barely 5&#39;8 and I was 6&#39;4 and now I feel like he was on his way towards being a six footer while I was slowly shrinking. Our heights right now are almost identical but in a few days I&#39;ll probably have to look up when talking to him. <br />
<br />
Seeing his hair wet, I can still see some traces of brown but his hair&#39;s base was fully black. His brows were much thicker, and his body was growing hair everywhere. David&#39;s original body was as smooth as they go so to see him grow so much hair was incredible. Water was cascading to his body, which was quite muscular but also heavy. There were no signs of six packs anywhere but he&#39;s got some massive pecs covered with fur. His ass was also developing quite nicely and his dick was limp but it was still impressive and a lot bigger than mine. His body was truly that of a man and not a teenage boy. <br />
<br />
I never considered myself as a stud back in my original body but seeing David naked almost looking like an identical version of my old self is turning me on. Did David have these feelings before? Or is this all me? <br />
<br />
&quot;Frank, David good you&#39;re both here&quot; a woman in all white said as we were toweling ourselves in the gym locker room. &quot;I&#39;d like you both to come to Dr. Markle&#39;s office&quot; she said.</p>
