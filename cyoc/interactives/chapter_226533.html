<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle was 13 years old.  She was destined to be a popular girl when she was older.  Petite, and blonde with a pink sundress on.  She had not a care in the world, as she walked home from her best friends house.   <br />
<br />
On the way home Michelle decided to cut through the land to the senior home near her friends house.  The place always seemed off to anyone walking by it.  No one seemed to visit anyone there but numerous elderly people were always occupied and doing activities.   It was run by a woman, who seemed to always be spying on the people around the neighborhood.  <br />
<br />
Michelle didn’t seem to care.  She was a cute girl and could get out of anything.   As she walked down the side of the yard, she saw various old people.  Michelle felt bad for them.  Having to live their lives in this hellhole.   Suddenly the woman stood in front of Michelle.  <br />
<br />
“Well hello little lady.  You seem to be lost” she said immediately intimidating Michelle.  <br />
<br />
“Thought I’d take a short cut” Michelle said trying to put on her cute charm.  <br />
<br />
“Well this is private property and I try to keep my guests as safe as possible” the woman said smirking. <br />
<br />
Michelle began to back away “Don’t worry it won’t happen again” Michelle said as the woman walked closer to her. <br />
<br />
“It won’t ever my dear.  Cause after this you’ll be my new resident” the woman said, as her hands began to emit a blue flame, as it hit Michelle.  The flame burrowed itself into Michelle as her heart sank.  “You try to be all cute to get your way dear, but I promise.  You won’t ever use that again” the woman said, as Michelle felt sick.  <br />
<br />
Michelle’s arms began to grow thick hairs on them.   Michelle screamed, as she saw her hairy arms.     Her body felt like it was being weighed down.  Suddenly she saw her beautiful blonde hair falling out of her head.    Her body began to fill out, as her legs and arms began to grow longer and wider.  <br />
<br />
She was heaving, as the dark hairs began to spread to her shoulders.  The top of her head was now bald, as it continued to thin and lose its color.  “What are you doing” Michelle squealed, as she looked down at her hands.  Age spots began to appear on her hands.  Fingers began to get thicker and callous.  Fingernails dulled, as her fingers and hands got hairer. <br />
<br />
Her pink dress was beginning to feel tight.  Michelle grunted, as her shoulders were getting wider and broader.    She was on her hands and knees, her body was getting larger by the second, as body felt so heavy.   “Let’s stand you up right” the woman said forcing Michelle to stand on her two feet.  <br />
<br />
She looked to see how big she was becoming.   She howled her voice deepening.   Her shoulders were growing thick hairs on them, as they began to travel down her back.   Her arms were now larger, as the hair traveled but to connect to her shoulders.  She let out a deep howl, as her stomach began to grow and inflate. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing to me?” Michelle screamed as her legs began to get thicker and hairier.   Her feet bursted through her shoes, as they got wider and manlier.    Michelle shifted his feet, as his feet were getting harder to see with his growing gut. <br />
<br />
“You’re gonna be a big man I think” the woman said, as Michelle’s dress began to burst.   His chest got fuller, as he was developing man-boobs.   Michelle gripped them with his large hands as he howled.  “Those will be the only tits you ever have” the woman said, as thick hairs grew on his chest. <br />
<br />
Michelle could barely hear her anymore, as her ears began to ring. They began to get larger and flop, as her nose began to grow. Her nose was now a wide and flat nose, with a mustache. The hair was growing on his chin, as Michelle tried to cover her face.<br />
Michelle was crying, as her cheeks and forehead were beginning to sag. Her once pretty and cute face was now deformed and wrinkly. Her forehead was now a large wrinkle, and her cheekbones were gone.<br />
Her eyes were now sunken in, with dark circles under them.<br />
Michelle tried to touch her face, but was struggling, as his arms and hands were growing and losing mobility. His skin was loose, as it began to get hairier and darker. Michelle screamed, as his hair began to grow on his neck and chest.<br />
<br />
Michelle had not noticed his body had gotten wider, and his gut had gotten much bigger. He was really beginning to feel like an old man. His mind was breaking, as he began to remember his name as Nigel. He could not remember what happened, but he knew this is who he was now.<br />
Nigel began to walk, as his back began to curve and his knees became swollen. His bones were beginning to ache, and he could not bend over. The witch laughed, as Nigel was getting hairier, as man boobs saggy more, as he was going to be stuck at this nursing home.<br />
Nigel was no longer a young girl, he was an old man who needed constant care. He was an easy target for<br />
the witch. His mind was wiped, as he looked confused, as clothing went around his massive body.</p>
