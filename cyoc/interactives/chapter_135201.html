<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ella and Simone had faced plenty of discrimination in their time. Being black made some people see you as less than human. And even in this modern age, there were still an annoying amount of men who saw themselves as superior to women. Of course, things were a lot better in the 21st century than they had been in the last few decades. But at least Ella and Simone had kept their biggest &#39;flaw&#39; to themselves.<br />
<br />
People had assumed they lived together for so long because they were very good friends. In actuality, they were lovers. America was slower to accept homosexuality than the other differences. Ella and Simone had seen the stories of people who were savagely beaten just because they didn&#39;t fit with the norm. And the current administration was not making it any easier for homosexual couples. There had been progress for gay rights, but there was also people trying to see it undone.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Ella and Simone weren&#39;t at Horizon Labs just because Animalia was more accepting of other people&#39;s differences. Simone had Type 1 diabetes, which is not uncommon for African-Americans. Simone took pretty good care of herself, but there&#39;s a point where her age as well as her condition started shutting her kidneys down. It wasn&#39;t very likely she&#39;d find a doner for her and she and Ella weren&#39;t ready to say goodbye yet. So Simone went to Lyre to sign up for Project Phoenix. And Ella was more than wealthy enough to pay for her own conversion.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Judy was looking at the ladies&#39; conversion forms. &quot;So, Simone, you&#39;re wanting to be a black panther, correct?&quot; asked Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, child,&quot; said Simone, &quot;What other form would be better for a black girl like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you don&#39;t have to conform a panther,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I like panthers anyways,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Ella, you&#39;re wanting to be a lioness?&quot; asked Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I see myself as more regal than a panther,&quot; said Ella, &quot;No offense, Simone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None taken,&quot; said Simone, &quot;We&#39;re still gonna be two cool cats with plenty of pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just listing the option, but you are aware that you could become a hermaphrodite lion if you wish,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have those now?&quot; asked Ella. People who have been keeping tabs with Animalia knew about Project Hermaphroditus. As far as Ella knew, there were only horses and hyenas part of that project at the moment. She hadn&#39;t heard much more, except that two of its members, Buddy and Louise, had gotten married.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re relatively new,&quot; said Judy, &quot;They&#39;ve been trying for variety with Project Hermaphroditus for a while and eventually lions were added.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose that&#39;d mean I&#39;d be able to breed with Simone, would I?&quot; asked Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically no,&quot; said Judy, &quot;I mean, I think it&#39;s possible for certain species of the <i>Panthera</i> family to interbreed, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite enough within the limits of Animalia&#39;s edicts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella shrugged and said, &quot;I&#39;m not particularly interested in growing a dick anyways. If me and Simone really wanted kids, we could adopt or get a surrogate father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, I should tell you something else,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Animals aren&#39;t normally attracted to the same sex. Our breeding instincts tell us to go with the opposite sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you telling us we&#39;re wrong to love each other?&quot; asked Simone, sounding offended.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you&#39;ll be getting your animal mating instincts and it&#39;s going to affect your interests,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying we&#39;ll fall out of love with each other?&quot; asked Ella with worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you are going to become bisexual,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Your feelings towards each other won&#39;t change, but you&#39;ll also be drawn to males of your respective species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like something to be worried about,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Judy, &quot;But I&#39;m sure I can recommend a therapist for you if you&#39;re concerned afterwards. But let&#39;s see about your conversions now.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
With so many lions and panthers in Animalia now, it wasn&#39;t that hard to get Ella and Simone some milk from their respective intended species. Their thermoses were marked with the heads of their respective big cats so they wouldn&#39;t get them mixed up. The amount of milk in each thermos would be enough to make them double-dosed, as long as they paused halfway.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you looking forward to being young and healthy again?&quot; asked Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; said Simone, &quot;And I can&#39;t wait to be a sexy panther.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither can I,&quot; said Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, down the hatch,&quot; said Simone as she took a long drink from her thermos. Ella also took a swig from her thermos. Cat milk was not as tasty as cow milk. But Ella could feel a heat entering her body. &quot;Here we go,&quot; said Simone as she saw patches of black fur appearing on her body.<br />
<br />
Ella saw tan fur starting to spread across her own body. She watched with fascination as her fingernails were swallowed up by her fingertips before extending out again as claws. Then she felt a discomfort in the back of her pants. &quot;Simone, could you give me a hand with this?&quot; she asked, reached backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but you have to do mine,&quot; said Simone before walking over and tearing open the back of Ella&#39;s pants with ease. Ella&#39;s growing tail escaped out into the open, a tuft of black fur already growing on the end. &quot;Ok, now do me,&quot; said Simone, turning around.<br />
<br />
Ella found her claws were able to easily slash through the material of Simone&#39;s pants. Ella found her lover&#39;s tail fascinating, but liked the sight of her black fur-covered bottom more. &quot;I can almost see it perking up,&quot; said Ella, cupping Simone&#39;s cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet it&#39;s not,&quot; said Simone, feeling the changes starting to slow down as her new paws burst out of her shoes, &quot;I think it&#39;s time for the second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right about that,&quot; said Ella as her face started pushing out into a muzzle. However, that didn&#39;t keep her from being able to drink from the thermos. She downed the rest of her milk as quickly as she could. Simone was already polishing hers off.<br />
<br />
The two she-cats gave out lusty moans as invigorating energy filled their bodies. The aching they had been feeling in their bodies was erased. Their old, worn muscles were regaining strength and becoming nicely toned. The asses which had been sagging because taut and firm again. Their breasts were also regaining their old shapeliness. Even more so since they were bigger than before. The grey streaks completely left their hair, leaving them shiny and black again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s more like it,&quot; said Simone, rubbing her sexy panthress body, &quot;Never thought being a cat would feel so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Ella, who was reveling in her gorgeous lioness body, &quot;This is better than I&#39;ve ever felt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than anything?&quot; asked Simone coyly, &quot;I think I can think of something that&#39;ll feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do show me,&quot; purred Ella.<br />
<br />
The two big cats soon got very passionate. They spent what little time between kissing to tear the clothes off each other. Before long, they were on the bed, scissoring together. &quot;Ooh, don&#39;t stop, baby, don&#39;t stop,&quot; moaned Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never stop for you,&quot; grunted Ella. She loved the way their big boobs were bouncing against each other, but not as much as they were grinding against each other. &quot;So close, I&#39;m gonna...&quot; panted Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me...too...&quot; panted Simone before they let out a loud feline yowl as they climaxed together. After catching their breaths, Simone said, &quot;That was incredible, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re incredible,&quot; said Ella, giving her lover&#39;s breasts a quick squeeze.<br />
<br />
Simone moaned a bit before asking, &quot;Say, Ella, what would think about me getting a big ol&#39; Afro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a disco queen?&quot; asked Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that big,&quot; said Simone, &quot;But big enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking of a new hairdo too,&quot; said Ella, &quot;What would you say to dreadlocks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Egyptian or Caribbean style?&quot; asked Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a lioness now. What do you think?&quot; asked Ella dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be fine with whatever you want, as long as you don&#39;t leave me,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;d never leave you,&quot; said Ella, &quot;Even if my body has other interests.&quot; She placed a gentle, tender kiss on her lover&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do now?&quot; asked Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking of putting these new tongues of ours to good use,&quot; said Ella in a suggestive tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, you are really wild,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bring out the beast in me,&quot; said Ella.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t seem likely that these two would be breaking up, but a bit of anxiousness existed at the back of their minds. Once they&#39;ve adjusted to their new lives, they&#39;ll probably be seeking out a therapist to keep them from drifting apart.</p>
