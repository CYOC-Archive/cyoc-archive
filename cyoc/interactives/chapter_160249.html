<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas being the naturally curious type wanted to see what the whole house now looked like from the viewpoint of a toddler.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m wanna go explore the house&quot; he told Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s fine by me, I can see why that might appeal to you now&quot; she replied with a thoughtful look, &quot;I bet everything must look really different to you now that you&#39;re a whole lot smaller than before. I probably look like a big scary giant to you right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you kind of do&quot; Thomas agreed with a giggle and Sarah laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you go and have fun exploring and meanwhile I&#39;ll go fix you up something to eat.&quot; Noticing the confused look that crossed the little boy&#39;s face she quickly explained, &quot;I know that we had lunch before the procedure but Dr. Issacs mentioned to me that you might get hungry sometime soon afterward due to the energy your body used up in the regression. That and your stomach is probably empty after all that pooping you did in your diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas proudly grinned at the mention of his first number two, the memory of it still fresh in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of diapers you let me know if you need yours changed, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded once, &quot;I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then you go run off and enjoy yourself and I&#39;ll come get you when the food is ready&quot; Sarah told him.<br />
<br />
Nodding again Thomas turned and eagerly toddled off in the opposite direction, his thumb easily finding its way back into his mouth.<br />
<br />
He only went four steps before he abruptly stopped upon realizing that he still had his clothes on. Now that he was home he didn&#39;t technically need to wear them anymore and besides there was really only one article of clothing that Thomas wanted to go around in, the one that defined him as a baby. And currently that article of clothing was being hidden from view by his shorts. Thomas then decided to rectify this by reaching down and undoing them, letting them drop to the floor with a flourish revealing the thick padded white between his legs. Kicking the shorts away along with his shoes he threw off his shirt and threw it down on the floor as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like someone really wants to go around in just their diaper&quot; Sarah giggled from behind at now seeing the young toddler in nothing but his Pampers.<br />
<br />
Turning around to face her Thomas gave her a pouty defiant look, &quot;Uh huh, I worked super hard to get them back so I&#39;m gonna wear just mine all the time now&quot; he said reaching down to pull the disposable garment up making sure it was nice and snug before turning back around and scampering off. Ignoring Sarah&#39;s lighthearted chuckling at his childish antics Thomas instead focused on the freeing feeling of the air rushing pass his exposed skin and the crinkling of his padding.<br />
<br />
With no clear order in mind Thomas began to aimlessly wander from room to room starting with the living room. His large 70 in. 4K flat screen TV looked even more huge and enormous now that he had shrunk in size and Thomas grew excited at the thought of watching cartoons and movies on it. Taking a look at the sectional couch he saw that it too had grown in height since he last saw it this morning, the cushions now level with his waist. The increase meant that he would now be forced to climb in order to get on the couch and the thought of having to do that pleased him greatly. Thomas liked the physical limitations of his new body as it further reminded that he was a baby now. Though the diaper he had on did a lot of that already, he wanted more of the experience whether it be in the form of changes, baby bottles or even pacifiers.<br />
<br />
Checking the rest of the living room revealed nothing else particularly interesting aside from the playpen set up in the corner and the pile of age appropriate toys Sarah had put out earlier this morning before they left to ReGenesis. Deciding he would play with them later Thomas moved on to the kitchen where Sarah currently was. She gave him a friendly hello as he toddled on by and explore the table by crawling in and around the chair&#39;s legs. He took a moment to inspect the highchair and booster seat that were there, the former having been bought for an optional dining experience.<br />
<br />
Thomas quickly grew bored and decided to go upstairs and check out his room. Heading down the hallway he approached the staircase that led to the second floor. Rather than climb the steps like a &#39;big boy&#39; he got down on his hands and knees and crawled up them one by one. Looking like a baby who hadn&#39;t learned to walk yet Thomas giggled at the fact he had temporarily given up his &#39;toddler&#39; status by embracing such an infantile form of locomotion.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the top of the staircase he stood back up on two feet in a triumphant manner before making his way down the upper hall. On the second floor there was three bedrooms; a guest room, Sarah&#39;s room and his room. There was also two bathrooms, one was part of Sarah&#39;s room and the other was directly across the hall from his room. Since her bedroom was nothing special and his was more interesting, he decided to skip hers and head for the door to his. Thomas was just about to reach up and turn the doorknob when he noticed the bathroom door was open and he could see the toilet. Sparing a brief moment of his time he went through the open door and after checking to make sure Sarah wasn&#39;t around faced the toilet with crossed arms and a smug expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I won&#39;t be using you anymore dumb old toilet because I’m back in diapers again&quot; Thomas declared before blowing a raspberry at the porcelain throne he once used to do his business.<br />
<br />
He actually wished he ended up having an accident right then and there just to prove his dependency on the garment, that would have made the moment even more perfect.<br />
<br />
With his childish proclamation complete he returned to the hall and proceeded to open the door to reveal his brand-new bedroom, which he had set up a week before hand. It was designed to suit a toddler and filled with the appropriate furnishings. There was a small child sized bed, a four-drawer dresser and toy chest along with a closet. The bed had Pokémon themed blankets and sheets and the walls had a variety of posters featuring animated characters from Kung Fu Panda and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The ceiling had glow in the dark stars and planets stuck to it to provide illumination at night. But his favorite piece of furniture was the fully stocked changing table set up against the wall, the presence of which was as comforting to him as the garments he wore that were to be changed atop it. A close second was the crib that he had set up in one of the corners of the room for when Thomas wanted to regress a bit further and really sleep like a baby.<br />
<br />
Wanting to see what he looked like now and remembering there was a full-length mirror on the inside of the closet door he waddled over to it.<br />
<br />
Pulling the large door wide open revealed not only the mirror but that the closet was empty save for a large 60 count box of Pampers Cruisers. Ignoring the box containing his extra padding Thomas focused on the reflection that greeted him in the mirror, gone was the young man he had formerly been and in its place was a young toddler boy whose image Thomas only recognized previously from old home videos and the family album.<br />
<br />
Being the huge adult baby and diaper lover that he was Thomas had copies made of every picture of his younger years, from age 1 up until he was successfully potty trained at age 4 with each of the pictures having his padding visible. Whenever he wanted to indulge, he would take out the photo and stare at them fondly, fantasizing about being that age again and being padded up.<br />
<br />
But no more, the fantasy had now become a reality.</p>
