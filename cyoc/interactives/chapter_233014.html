<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And quickly walked up to her and said, looking down at the little boy Jeffy, who was shocked to find he was now a 7-year-old boy wearing a Superman shirt and skinny black shorts. It didn’t help that he now looked and felt different, with Mandy also noticing he was a cute boy with skinny limbs and bleach-black hair flowing past his shoulders.<br />
<br />
When he was a kid this age before, he had been a fat buzz-cut kid growing up. But she said, “Okay, Jeffy, I think you know you shouldn’t barge in on your big sister and her… friend. Now come on.” With that, she scooped up her now-little brother, whose mouth was still hanging open, not even realizing how his hands wrapped around her neck and his legs around her waist. She walked out of the room and into a new room, which was once their little sister’s but was now decorated for a young boy, filled with Little League and soccer stuff everywhere. From a baseball bat mounted on the wall to soccer ball sheets, it was clear.<br />
<br />
She dropped him onto the kid&#39;s bed and said, “Okay Jeffy, you know not to come into my room again without knocking, especially when I’m with my friend doing… adult stuff, okay?”<br />
<br />
The little boy seemed to be coming out of the shock of being turned into a different-looking little boy and said, “B-but I’m not a little boy, I’m a big boy! And you changed me into this!” He obviously cringed at his new high-pitched child’s voice, which sounded like he could be part of a church choir, pointing to himself as he said the last part.<br />
<br />
He continued, “A-and you need to turn me back now!” He folded his arms, but it was obvious the program had altered his way of acting and speaking to blend into his new kid’s body. Mandy, unaware of this, only remembered Jeff as Jeffy, her little brother who was too sporty. She adored him as her little cute baby brother, but right now, he was in one of his annoying moods where he hated her having friends around and wanted to be part of it.<br />
<br />
She sighed and said, “Jeffy, this is not the time to play. I have a special friend around, and you can’t play with us. And, well, you looked like you weren’t happy with what we were doing when you barged in. So, I want you to stay out of my room until my special friend is gone, and you are old enough to know to knock and listen, okay?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked shocked. He didn’t know what to do because it was obvious his sister didn’t remember being his little sister. He was supposed to be a big 16-year-old. The funny thing was that he was starting to get memories of this new life, looking at the trophies in the room and remembering the Little League and soccer games he had gotten them at. He knew he had no interest in such stuff before, but now, thinking about playing them, he couldn’t help but feel adrenaline start pumping in his new body. He felt ready to have fun playing, and he could now remember his new school and classes and how he was a genius with a brain still like a 16-year-old. He had tons of friends now, much more than before when he was only interested in sci-fi and video games that his dad got him into. He realized he was more of a mommy’s boy, and while his dad didn’t really like sports, he loved them and was happy his mom always took him and cheered for him.<br />
<br />
His sister just sighed and said, “Well, I need to get back to my friend. He’ll be gone by the time you come back from the park, where you’re going to meet all of your cool friends. Isn’t your best friend Max coming over for a sleepover? And Dad is going to let you both watch Star Wars! So, I think you need to get ready for that, okay?” She walked out of the now little boy&#39;s room, leaving Jeff in disbelief. He couldn’t believe what was going on in his head. The new memories were pushing into his mind, and he felt excitement knowing how cool it would be to hang out at the park and have Max sleep over. And the thought of being old enough for the first Star Wars movie made him thrilled. But he still remembered everything about his other life and thought maybe Max, his best friend, could help him break into his sister’s room and take control of the computer that did this. He jumped off the bed, ready to ask his mom if she knew where his shoes were and if she could take him to the park now!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back with Mason and Mandy, Mandy was just happy in the lap of the love of her life, making out with him. Mason was enjoying having a hot girlfriend but was conflicted, knowing what had happened to Jeff. He was the only person in the world who knew Jeff was once his 16-year-old friend who loved all the sci-fi stuff Mason loved. However, he didn’t want to ruin what he had with Mandy now, so he pushed it to the back of his mind, knowing he could change Jeff back anytime.</p>
