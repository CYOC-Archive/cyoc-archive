<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean stands there, awed and stares at the beautiful car, “it... it&#39;s so beautiful,” he whispers, his eyes sparkle.<br />
<br />
“I am happy you like it,” Jeff&#39;s voice suddenly is heard from inside the car, causing Dean to jump in surprise.<br />
<br />
Dean looks around, “Je-Jeff? Wh-where are you?”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “well, where do you think,” he asks, “or have you forgotten that I am your car?”<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes...,&#39; Dean thinks, “n-no of course not,” he then says. Dean opens the driver&#39;s side door and gets in, sitting down on the leather seat and takes in a deep breath. “God... I love the smell of a brand new car, fresh from the manufacture,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe... I can&#39;t wait for you to drive me,” Jeff says, his voice coming from the speakers.<br />
<br />
“Okay... I guess your mouth has become the radio,” Dean asks.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Jeff says, “and the computer is my mind including my memories plus all the important stuff a car needs.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, cool,” Dean says, not really paying attention as he looks around the car, “well, I&#39;d say, time to get this baby registered,” he then says. The teen starts the car up, and grabs the shifter, causing Jeff to moan, “what the hell?!”<br />
<br />
“Um... s-sorry Dean,” Jeff says, “it... appears that the sh-shifter is my... penis.”<br />
<br />
“Well, okay... but keep down the moaning will you,” Dean says.<br />
<br />
“I-I&#39;ll try,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Dean rolls the car out of the woods and onto the main road, turning towards down town, all the time he hears Jeff moaning about how good it feels: Dean&#39;s hand on his shifter, the road under his four tires... Dean gets more and more frustrated. “Your moaning is really starting to get on my nerves,” the boy says, “I&#39;m going to turn off the radio.”<br />
<br />
“Dean... wai...,” Jeff tries to say, but he is muted as Dean turns off the radio.<br />
<br />
“Much better, besides a car is not supposed to talk,” Dean says, &#39;I got to do something about that, also I need to find a way to make it impossible for Jeff to turn back to human without my permission,&#39; he then thinks. Maybe once the ownership gets transferred to him, that issue will be dealt with.<br />
<br />
Dean soon arrives at the car-registration office building, he parks his car in the parking lot, and after grabbing the car papers from the glove compartment, gets out and closes the door, “time to make it official,” he says.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the radio turns on by itself and Jeff&#39;s voice shouts over the speakers, “DEAN, WAIT! I WILL BE TRANS...,” he is unable to finish his sentence as Dean locks the car, sending Jeff into sleep mode.<br />
<br />
“Crazy ass radio,” Dean mumbles to himself as he makes his way to the entrance, “I got to get that issue sorted, maybe I should stop by a chop-shop after I&#39;ve registered the car to get the system checked and fixed.” The moment Jeff had fully transformed into Dean&#39;s car, the teen for some reason began to see Jeff as an object, not as a human.<br />
<br />
The boy enters the registration office and walks up to the counter, “good day,” he says to the young lady, “I&#39;d like to get my new car registered.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, hun,” the woman says, “please pull a number and wait in the waiting area, you&#39;ll be called up.”<br />
<br />
Dean does as told, his number is 140, he looks over at the scree, on which the numbers are displayed, “130... oh well,” he says, “I&#39;ve got time,” he then walks to a free chair and sits down, waiting patiently for his turn.<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes it is finally Dean&#39;s turn, his number and the number of the desk is called up. The boy walks over to the desk and greets the young man, “good day, sir,” he says as he sits on a chair.<br />
<br />
The man looks up and smiles at the boy, “good day to you too,” he says kindly, “what can I do for you?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like to get my new car registered,” Dean says and hands the man the papers.<br />
<br />
The man takes the papers and lies them in front of him, “okay, let me pull up the documents,” he says as he starts typing in the serial number, which actually is Jeff&#39;s birthday (15th January 2000), name and age (16): JE15FF01SMITH200016. “Got it,” the man says, “wow, a Skoda Superb Sportline? Isn&#39;t that a little bit to much for a first car,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Dean shrugs, “my parents gave it to me,” he says, “you know how the saying goes: parents know best,” he adds with a grin.<br />
<br />
The man nods with a smile, “okay, let me pull up the ownership slip,” he says, “okay, what is your full name?”<br />
<br />
“Dean Johnson,” Dean says and the man types it into the system.<br />
<br />
“Your birthday?”<br />
<br />
“30th of February 2000,” Dean replies.<br />
<br />
“Next I need your full adress,” the man says.<br />
<br />
“That would be, Oak Street number 130,” Dean says, “the postal code is 30354 Atlanta, GA.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, now a phone number,” the man then says and Dean gives him his mobile number.<br />
<br />
“The name of the model is “JEFF”, would you like to change that,” the man then asks, “if you can&#39;t think of a name we could leave it blank and you can give the car a name on a later date.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good, let&#39;s do that,” Dean says, “I&#39;ll think of a nice name, I&#39;d like the plates of the car however spell my name “DEAN”, is that possible?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” the man says, he deletes the name of the “car” and moves on to the next topic. “Okay, that should be everything, now let&#39;s get those plates designed,” he then says. The man confirms the changes to the car&#39;s system.<br />
<br />
At Jeff&#39;s house, the Chronivac activates itself as it detects a change to the “subjects” settings. “ERROR! Subject altered,” a message reads, “adjusting subject to new situation. Owner of subject “Dean Johnson”, countdown stopped, subject can only transform if owner commands it.”<br />
<br />
Back at the registration office, the man pulls up the program, with which he can design the car plates. “Okay, so you wanted the plates to spell your first name,” he asks, Dean nods, “okay, any special additions? You can have a sun, palm tree or anything as a colourful addition.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm... do you have something like a blue dragon,” Dean asks, “I really like dragons.”<br />
<br />
The man scrolls through the plate settings and nods, “yep, would you like the dragon to be between DE and AN?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, please,” Dean says, with a nod the man confirms the design.<br />
<br />
“Okay, you can pick up the plates at the plate office,” he says, “I think we are done, if I missed anything, I&#39;ll contact you and we&#39;ll get it sorted. Would you like one of our insurance offers?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, give me an insurance which covers minor damages,” Dean says, “I don&#39;t have much money, I am only 16 after all.”<br />
<br />
The man nods, “we have an insurance for a monthly rate of 30 USD,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” Dean says, “I&#39;ll take it.”<br />
<br />
The man nods again and fills out the insurance form, then he hands Dean a tablet, “now I just need your signature, the first one is the ownership and the second is the insurance.”<br />
<br />
Dean takes the tablet-pen handed to him and signs both forms, the man then confirms both signatures after checking Dean&#39;s ID and with that the “car” officially belongs to Dean and Dean could not be any happier, as his wide smile shows.<br />
<br />
“Congratulations to your first car,” the man says with a smile, “now, head to the counter, your plates should be ready.”<br />
<br />
Dean nods, he thanks the man and walks to the counter, “miss, I want to pick up my car plates,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Are you Dean Johnson,” the woman asks, Dean confirms, showing the woman his ID, “very well, here are your plates.”<br />
<br />
Dean grabs the freshly printed and stamped plates and hurries out to his car to get them attached. The boy unlocks the car and opens the trunk, taking out the tool box of the car.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the radio turns on, “D-Dean... I f-feel strange,” Jeff says over the speakers, “s-something&#39;s wrong.”<br />
<br />
Dean ignores him, &#39;I really got to get that damn radio fixed,&#39; the boy thinks to himself, &#39;also, also the system needs a check up.&#39; The boy then takes out a screwdriver and attaches the plates to the back and front of his “car”. Dean stands back, a huge smile on his face, “it is official,” he says, “you are now mine, baby.” He gets in and starts the ignition, “next stop, the chop-shop,” with that he drives out of the parking lot and onto the main road.</p>
