<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the pen with an air of respect and fear at what it was capable of Dave knew that even though it was mightily fun what he was able to do with it the pen was also very dangerous and he should tread very lightly. The instance with the hair taught him that perhaps he shouldn’t rewrite his own life at the moment and instead focus on remaking the rest of the world and his fellow workers more agreeable to him first baring the management of his workplace of course and not going about risking his job. This mindset is why even though he was bitterly angry at Joe for scheduling the company meeting during the lunch break he didn’t want to risk changing something about Joe that could adversely effect his job or even his own existence in the company. Still earlier Pete did stall Joe and give Dave some extra time and he was looking forward to rewarding Pete and his friendship through lunch and now that option was moot.<br />
<br />
After settling back into his chair Dave suddenly shot his head upwards from its downtrodden position as a new idea came into his head. “I still can have lunch with Dave and it won’t effect the management staff in anyway at least not outwardly” Dave said to himself as he looked back at the pen on his desk and the blank piece of paper sitting beside it. What Dave was thinking was quite bizarre and maybe a bit cruel to his friend but Dave kept his promises even if it meant swapping people around in the process. Picking up the pen in his writing hand Dave gave it one last inspection as his mind raced to the next steps he had to perform. Striking the pen to the paper Dave quickly wrote: “Pete Simpson will turn into Joe Daniels beautiful new female secretary Penelope Simpson. Penelope Simpson is fresh out of high school at nineteen years old around five and a half feet tall, physically fit, has large breasts, and has strong Nordic features including long blonde hair and blue eyes. Pete will retain all of his former male memories and personality traits and will still believe that he is Pete even though he will also be aware that he is no longer in his male body. At the same time Pete as Penelope will have all the skills and education necessary to perform the duties of a secretary and will know that the position that she holds at this company is that of a secretary. I will be the only other person besides her that knows who she used to be before the change.” Lifting the pen from the paper Dave was impressed with himself in his ability to write such clear and concise instructions just at the drop of a hat as he saw with the passing of several seconds the writing on the paper begin to glow.<br />
<br />
Cursing himself for not setting himself up in a better position ahead of time to watch the reaction Dave quickly got up from his desk and walked over to his door which he promptly opened a crack. The secretary desk outside of Joe Daniels office formerly occupied by his longtime assistant Marcy was empty and the new Penelope was nowhere to be found. Just then Dave spotted a beautiful blonde woman   nervously exiting Pete’s old office space which looked unused with no name tag on the door. The woman was wearing a collared and long-sleeved white blouse with several of the buttons left undone near the top, a tight slightly above-the-knee length black pencil skirt and black high heels. A black leather pocketbook hung from her right shoulder. The woman looked unsure of herself for a few minutes shaking her head and looking back to Pete’s old office before then looking towards what Dave believed was her real position at a small desk in front of Joe Daniels office. Rinse and repeat for a few moments of this back and forth with her confusion until suddenly she gave her head one last shake ruffling her long blonde hair around in the process and began making her way towards the desk a short distance from her. Opening up a desk draw once she arrived the woman dropped her pocketbook in the space and closed it before lowering herself comfortably down to the chair. Scooting herself in she turned on the laptop in front of her and began quickly typing on the keyboard at a speed Dave never saw the old Pete work at. Suddenly the phone rang and the new woman quickly picked up the receiver “Joe Daniels office this is his secretary Penelope speaking how may I help you? Sure please hold” the woman trawled off as she directed the call to Joe in his office with an air of professionalism.<br />
<br />
Dave was stunned at what he just saw as he quickly closed his door and leaned his back up against it thinking of the possibilities that this may bring to his relationship with Pete actually at this point Penelope.</p>
