<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Please..... Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, you looked around. Everywhere you looked, darkness. One moment ago, you had been lying down in bed to go to sleep, then you were here. So, this was most likely a dream. Yet, for a dream, it was strangely empty of scenery, actions, and pretty much everything. Instead, infinite darkness stretched out in every direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is anyone there?&quot; A girl's voice.<br />
<br />
You turned and looked every direction, trying to find where she was calling from. Then, you saw her.<br />
<br />
The girl was wearing silver dress, a few bracelets and anklets, though no shoes or socks. Her hair for some reason was a light blue, and fell down to her ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please. Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; You called back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found someone thank the gods. Please, I have no idea who you are, but you must help. My name is Saphira. I've lost something very important, and now my entire world may suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; You respond. &quot;It is official. This dream makes less sense and is less logical than any other one I've ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; She cried. &quot;This is not a dream. Well it is a dream, but it's not a dream. Let me explain. The only way I could contact someone in your world is through telepathy. However, they must be sleeping at the time, and I have no control over who I am put in contact with. Now please listen, my own world is in about to perish, and your own is in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Until you wake up, it's not like you have anything better to do, so you decide to listen to her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;My world, is a parallel universe of your's. While in your world technology prevailed, in my, mythical and spiritual energy rule. Basically, you have your world of technology and mine of magic. In my world, there are Seven Ancient Tomes that act as the source of all forms of magic. These tomes were originally kept sealed within ancient temples, and put under guard to insure that the fabric of my universe was not destroyed. I know myself, for I am one of the guardians. For those in my world, the tomes were much sought after, as if one was able to retrieve one they would obtain untold power. However, if all the tomes were removed from their temples, then my world would loose all magic, and cease to exist. The books and their respective powers are.....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Beast: This book gives control over all animals. With it, you can command any animal to do any bidding for you. That is not the book's only power though. Whoever owns the book will also gain the ability to transform themselves or others into animals, or partway. For example, if they wanted, they could just give themselves the claws of a beast to increase attack power, or a monkey tail for an extra arm. You can make anyone with this book any combination of man and beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Time: This book is a powerful book that grants one the power of chronomancy. They can use this power to change the flow of time of others, making them younger, or older, or even stop them from aging ever again. It also has abilities such of that as freezing time, freezing just certain individual's in time, or even traveling through time. Probably the best ability of this book is that whoever owns it is immune to time paradoxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Body: This book gives one control over the shape of their own and others' bodies. For example, they could make themselves more and or less muscular, and thus stronger or weaker, as well as make them and others larger or smaller. Another power of this book is to change the gender of the one a spell is being cast on. Basically, it can change one's body in any way without changing its species, or giving it a supernatural ability. For example, if you give one wings they will not be able to fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Transmutation: While most books give you power over other people, this book gives you the power over the inanimate. You can transmute one substance into another with this book. For this reason, it is often sought by alchemists who want to transmute lead into gold. However, the book has one extremely formidable power. If used on a living creature, it can transmute them into an inanimate object.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Myth: The Book of Myth is similar to the Book of Beast. However, instead of controlling nearby animals, you gain the ability to summon and command fantastic creatures such as dragons, phoenixes, and unicorns. However, a warning. The wielder of this book's willpower must be stronger than the creature summoned or they will break loose of his control. For this reason, it's best to summon benevolent creatures who could understand your need for them. The tome also had an alternate ability like the Book of Beast, that allows the owner to transform themselves or others fully or partly into the fantastic beast you could summon. The form of everything from a simple elf to a fearsome dragon can be achieved through this book.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Mind: This powerful tome allows one to alter the mind of another. While they can not enslave the mind of another, they can alter their memories to make them think they were loyal to the wielder, or to make them think they're something else all together. It's a powerful book in the right hands, though lesser minds who use it will find themselves in ruin.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book of Arcane: Possibly the most sought after book. This book does not contain the ability to alter oneself or other people or objects like the other books, but instead contain the power of arcane magic. Everything from throwing fireballs, to summoning a thunderstorm can be achieved through this book.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If all these books are removed from my world, my world is perished. Which is why they are so well protected. Yet, someone still managed to steal them. They're apparently aware that this world will collapse without them, so have escaped into your world with the books. However, I think something went wrong with their plan, as when trying to enter your world the books were scattered. I managed to acquire one of the books after whoever stole them lost them. However, I am unable to enter your world. Therefore, I need to send the book into your world, to someone who will retrieve the others. Please, I care not if you use this book for good or own personal gain. Just please, take it and find the other six, and bring them back to my world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This seems relatively complex for a normal dream.&quot; You respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose, you will not believe this to be something other than a dream, until you receive the book in reality and witness its power. However, I can not give you the book until you agree to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I agree.&quot; You respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you. Whenever you sleep, I will contact you in your dreams to help you track down the other six books. As for this one, before I hand it to you.... Tell me a little about yourself.&quot;</p>
