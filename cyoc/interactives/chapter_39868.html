<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She dreamed and in her dreams, Anna learned that magick was responsible for all that was happening. She learned that one time she was probably a boy named Ric, but something happened and she became who she is today. She had a brother named Josh and he is somehow connected to Amelia. And then the vaguest part was the man named Fransisco Mendes, whoever he was.<br />
<br />
She awoke with a start, memories of being Ric flooding back, remembering everything and as she slid out of the bed, Anna thought to herself, &quot;I must find that book. It has to be here somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused as it came to her attention that Amelia was not in the room and then she gasped as she realized that she wasn't even in he same room she fell asleep in before. Walking around, Anna took in the canopy bed, the wardrobe, the night stand and a vanity for applying make-up, complete with brushes and various eyeliners, lipsticks, brushes and curling irons.<br />
<br />
In the wardrobe Anna found several clothes, all in her size. Selecting a flowing, low cut sundress and a pair of white bikini briefs with blue polka dots, she slipped her feet into a pair of sandals and exited the room.<br />
<br />
Outside she founds herself in an hallway that did not resemble the hallway she'd exited before. Walking back into the room, she gazed out the window. At first she only saw green grass as far as the eye could see. The longer she stared, the more it began to resemble the carpet in her room, complete with the glass of milk still hanging in the air instead of a real pale moon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd,&quot; Anna thought as she once again returned to the hallway. Looking up and down the hall, she called out, &quot;Amelia? Are you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer. Scared because she couldn't find her sister, Anna did note that whatever transformation the house had been undergoing, had stopped. Looking up and down the hall once again, figuring she might be in the front half of the house, Anna wondered where the stairs to the upstairs were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clearly I'm on the second story,&quot; she reasoned as she began to open doors.<br />
<br />
It was about twenty minutes into her search when she found the library. Curious, she entered. On one of the larger tables was several books open and next to on of them were several pieces of paper, each with something different written on them.<br />
<br />
It was the one with the names Fransisco Mendes and Ric written on them that caught her attention, but it was mixed in with a lot of gibberish. Not being able to make heads or tales of it, she picked up the piece of paper and tried to read it out loud, seeing if it made any sense what's so ever, but still not sure what she was reading.<br />
<br />
From behind her, a door opened and a Latin American man entered. Seeing what she was holding, he cursed and quickly muttered something in the gibberish that was written on the paper. But none of it made any sense to her as a pleasant feeling overcame her. As the world began to fade out to white, a memory sprang forth and the last thing she remembered was dropping the paper as she asked, &quot;Fransisco, is that you?&quot; and the man replying, &quot;So that's how it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Jon, who was really confused, was trying to think of himself as possibly being Joy. Uncomfortable because of the bloated, cramping feeling coming from her body, she paused next to a portrait of one of the school's founders.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt really nauseous and doubled over in both pain and fear that she was going to be sick right there and then. A wave of vertigo washed over her and she dropped to her knees and then fell to the floor, curling up in a fetal position, wanting to call out in help, but unable to make a single noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is everybody,&quot; she asked herself as the bloated, cramping feeling let up; only to be replaced by a burning sensation.<br />
<br />
All this confused her because it appeared that everything around her was growing larger. Scared, she pushed herself up, fell back down and then tried once again. Once she was up, forgetting her book bag, she began to take shaky steps down the hallway.<br />
<br />
A few steps and her shoes fell away, her feet to small to fit in them any more. A couple of more steps and her skirt fell off, followed by her underwear. To engrossed in trying to walk, she failed to notice as her bra melted away, her breast recessed back into her chest and her blouse began to change slowly into a onesie.<br />
<br />
As it grew to a size that fit her, a pink diaper fitted over her crotch and bottom. Overcome with the sense of being unable to hold herself up anymore, Joy dropped to the floor and began to crawl forward. She didn't get far before, overcome with exhaustion, she lay down on the floor, rolled over on her back and stuck her fist in her mouth. Withing minutes, she was asleep, sucking on her fist. Once asleep, the transformation sped up and with-in moments she was a five month old infant girl.<br />
<br />
Around her, the walls melted away. The floor became softer and bars started to form around her. Seconds later, Joy was laying in a crib and around that a house began to form, complete with two loving parents.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
The pleasant feeling grew as the whiteness increased around her. Presently other colours began to form and Anna found herself outside, looking up at what her memories told her to be Ric's house, her original house.<br />
<br />
Walking forward, Anna stopped when she noticed was walking on all fours. Looking down, she yipped in alarm. Rolling over on her side, she stuck her snout into her privates. Thinking, &quot;Well that's a relief. At least I'm still female,&quot; she began to look around the backyard, hoping she didn't have to live out the rest of her life as a Basset Hound.</p>
