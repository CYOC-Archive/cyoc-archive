<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time, you were allowed to wake up and get up on your own schedule, instead of being chased out of bed by your mom or dad come to make sure you&#39;re up and ready for Sunday services. Content to lie where you were, cuddling the plush you fell asleep snuggling with, still kind of tired because of the uneasy sleep you’d had, you eventually roll out of bed. Your thoughts going back over everything which had happened, jumping to what Mrs Griffiths had told you, then to your parents not being home the few times you tried, they finally settle on a question Julie had asked you yesterday.<br />
<br />
As the two of you were eating breakfast, and you had commented on the dishes she and her mom served you, she&#39;d asked, &quot;Do you like things which pretty?&quot; to which you&#39;d replied you guess so before wondering if there was something the matter with you, or if your mind was somehow changing. Thinking over this, still finding the idea you did in fact like things which were not only pretty, but also cute and beautiful, you stepped in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
The reflection of a girl clutching a plush toy stared back at you, and in much the same way you know you are now age seven, you feel you can say without a doubt there wasn&#39;t anything wrong with you, or your mind was being altered, but in ways you found difficult to understand, you&#39;d started to adapt and learn to be a girl. Unsure how you should take this, you consider whether it further cemented your need to find the well and undo your wish. Turning away from the mirror, thinking all of what you learned, feeling it was inadequate in the long run when compared with what a girl would know by the time she was the same age as you&#39;re now, comparing it to how your mind and thoughts were still clearly those of a boy age sixteen, despite how your new experience had added to it, you set the plush puppy on the bed. Going through the few items Mrs Griffiths had bought you, you select a pair of light blue board shorts, a tank top with a bright, pastel coloured scale print covering nearly all it, and, after a moment of deliberation, a clean pair of underwear.<br />
<br />
Dressed for the day, you take a look at your reflection one more time, think about doing something about your hair, and decided it could wait. Collecting the plush without a second thought, you exit the guest room. Heading toward the bathroom, placing the you on the sink, you don&#39;t stop to give too much thought as you sat down to pee, nor any of what you do afterward. When you were done, you collected the plush and hugging it, you head downstairs, where you find Julie and her mother were already up.<br />
<br />
Neither saying a thing about the plush toy you&#39;re carrying around, they instead bid you, &quot;Good morning,&quot; Julie asked if you wanted breakfast, and when you told her, &quot;Yes, please,&quot; Mrs Griffiths took down the bowl you used yesterday, got the matching spoon, and poured you some cereal and added a splash of milk.<br />
<br />
Food passed to you, you set the toy on the empty chair next to you and began eating. As you did, you kicked your legs back and forth in absent way as you went back over what you had been thinking about earlier, turned your mind to what you planned to do today, and glancing over at the plush, you were suddenly overcome with what you thought was the most ridiculous think you could think to do, yet somehow felt it was okay to do. Looking at the toy, thinking about picking it up, dishing up a spoonful of the cereal and offering it to the toy, much in the way a mommy would spoon-feed her baby, or a girl would pretend spoon-feed her dolly, you were distracted from these thoughts when Mrs Griffiths asked, &quot;Any plans for you two today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Across the table, Julie commented, &quot;We should definitely get in touch with Daniel&#39;s parents,&quot; and looking at you, she said, &quot;And I suppose you want to go looking for the well again.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod to acknowledge the last bit, you explained, &quot;Mommy and daddy goto church, an won&#39;t be home until afta twelve.&quot; taking note as you did you didn&#39;t even cringe at your altered speech and taking a bite of cereal, thinking it had to do with how you were adjusting, you furthered what you said with, &quot;An that&#39;s only if daddy hassan&#39;t planned sum famlee outting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afternoon is fine,&quot; Julie replied and about say something else, Mrs Griffiths offered, &quot;I think you should take a break from looking for this well,&quot; and holding up a hand to still your objections, she said, &quot;This has nothing to do with what I told you yesterday. Instead, what I&#39;m saying is from the perspective of a parent. You have been missing for two days now. And though you might have been a teenage, your parents will still be worried. You need to get a in touch with them, reassure them you are okay, and explain your situation. From the perspective of a concerned parent, this should be your priority, at least for today. Maybe tomorrow as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was so much you wanted to point out why you shouldn&#39;t hold off looking for the well. This biggest reason you could think of was there was no guarantee any of your family would be home, at least not until late in the day, five or six pm, seven at the latest. Then there was, for a lack of a better way to describe it, how you were getting used to be a girl, being comfortable as so. The idea of how you were adjusting to your situation didn&#39;t sit well with you, despite how you knew it didn&#39;t do any good to carry on as you had when you first awoke to your situation. Thinking over these things, and other reasons why continuing seeking the well should be your main concern, understanding you were making excuses, you still have nothing to answer Mrs Griffiths with. Finishing the last bites of cereal, you settle for, &quot;Okay I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not willing to settle for this, Mrs Griffiths stated, &quot;There is also an issue I feel I should be addressed. Mainly the amount of bike riding you are doing. Whilst I would never say no to exercise and bicycling, as it&#39;s good for you and is better than sitting around. And I am sure you&#39;d be used to the amount you&#39;ve been doing for the past two days, if you were still who you used to be. However, you need to take into account your limits now. You are seven years old. Your body is clearly not used to what you are making it do. If you need proof, look at the way you’ve come back each time so tired you can barely sit up, let along eat anything. Take a short break, give your body some time off, to reenergise. A day, maybe two at the most. After that, go out again, then take another day off, and repeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
What she said did make sense to you. When you were sixteen, the amount of bike riding you&#39;ve been doing would not have bothered you. But now, now you are willing to admit the reason you are so tired when you come back to the Griffiths&#39; place was because of how much you’re pushing yourself. Unsure how to describe how you&#39;re feeling, settling for dissatisfied with your body&#39;s new limits, but feeling this wasn&#39;t an adequate way of describing how you felt, you sighed and asked, &quot;Whatta am I do as I wait for mommy and daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something to do,&quot; Mrs Griffiths replied and turning to look at Julie, she said, &quot;But, in the meantime, your father and I have something place we need to be. We&#39;ll be back later today. Please make sure the last of your homework is finished, and we&#39;ll see you tonight,&quot; and glancing at you, she included you with, &quot;Both of you, if you haven&#39;t gotten a hold of your parents,&quot; and standing, Mrs Griffiths gave her daughter a hug and a peck on the cheek, came around the table, gave you a hug, and about to leave, she stopped and nodding toward the plush, she commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think I remember that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynn or Jessica used to place with him,&quot; Julie supplied. &quot;But neither one had in some time and he was buried toward the bottom of the pile of plush, among a couple others I set on the bed. I sort of handed them to Daniel to sleep with without giving any thought to what I was doing. Sort of like what I did yesterday with the dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last bit directed more toward you, you watched as Mrs Griffiths picked up the plush Dalmatian puppy and looked at it carefully. Handing to you after a bit, she asked, &quot;We bought him when we went Florida, when you were about five or six, right, Julie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think so,&quot; the teenage answered as she finished her breakfast, collected the dishes and took them to the sink.<br />
<br />
Mrs Griffiths nodded in response before leaving the room. Left alone with Julie, you hugged the plush as you wondered what you ought to do to pass the time. As if you&#39;d inquired this aloud, Julie turned away from the sink and said, &quot;I&#39;m going up to my wrong to get ready for the day and finish the last of my homework. Why don&#39;t you go watch television. Or, you can find any number of things in your room to occupy your time.<br />
<br />
Clear she&#39;d made another unintentional slip, and wanting to point out what she&#39;d said, you changed your mind. Letting the matter go, figuring it was going to keep happening, you muttered, &quot;Think I&#39;ll go see what&#39;s on tv,&quot; and hugging the plush close, you headed for the living room.<br />
<br />
When it was clear there wasn&#39;t anything on, as two of the channels were running live recordings of church services, a third had a news programme, whilst the fourth was still off the air, you head back to the guest room. There, unsure what to do, you locate the comb, brush, and a barrette. Doing your hair up into a pony tail, you put away the brush and comb and looking about the room. Peeking in the toy box, you examine the dollies and doll clothes, put them back, and look at the other toys. Taking out a pretend make-up kit, you asked the plush puppy, &quot;Do I hafta to play with this if stuck a girl?&quot; and putting it back, you pick through the toys a bit longer before, unsure what you’re looking for, nor what you&#39;re supposed to do with the toys, all for girls, you close the toy box.<br />
<br />
A quick look at the one bookcase, which was only a few inches taller than you and clearly intended for children, and the books placed upon, and you turn away. Having no interest at the moment in fantasy books about talking animals engaging in daring deeds, or in the case of a set of Angelina Ballerina books, doing activities you thought of as girly, and you wander over to the closet. Peeking inside, you examine the clothes hung up inside, and after a bit, discover there are dress-up costumes as well. Examining the princess costumes, all with tights and crowns, the fairy costumes, which also had tights, but pretend wings instead of crowns, among others, you find yourself torn between liking how they looked and wondered what it&#39;d be like to try them on, play in them, and the sense of needing to distance yourself from something your mind insisted would be inappropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m a girl now, so itta be okay,” you thought, but found this didn&#39;t matter, as you considered how, as soon as you found the well, you wouldn&#39;t be.<br />
<br />
A glance over at the plush puppy, and you asked it for its opinion. Getting none, as your mind insisted it wouldn&#39;t give one, it was a toy, you look at the plush Angelina Ballerina. Turning back to the closet, you take out one of the ballet costumes you’d found. Looking at the black bodysuit with an attached lacy skirt, you check the tag. Seeing it was a size S, you stand in front of the mirror and hold it up in front of you. Finding you couldn&#39;t tell anything, you huff in agitation and about to put it back, you instead look for a pair of tights, find a white pair and proceed to change into the costume.<br />
<br />
Still in front of the mirror, unsure if you are wearing any of it right, as you have decided to put on the tights first, without any underwear, followed by the bodysuit. Adjusting the shoulder straps, twirling so the skirt, which had a glittery appearance, flared out, then examining how the garment hugged your body and was like the swimsuit, loose, but not baggy, yet tight, but not in an uncomfortable way. Glancing at the ballet slippers, then at your reflection, you think you should take the stuff off before your caught, and instead sit down. Taking your time, working out how they laced up around the leg, it wasn&#39;t long before you had the last piece of the costume on, which you are surprised how comfortable they felt and how cute they look on your feet.<br />
<br />
Satisfied after some time, you glance at the mirror. Seeing a girl sitting on the floor with her legs spread like a boy, you asked yourself, “Can I look to doing stuff like this if I hafta be a girl?” as you again think you should take the stuff off.<br />
<br />
No answer coming to you as you found you were actually liking being dressed the way you were, you decided you don’t want to take the costume off for the moment. Standing, you stare into the mirror and try, unsuccessfully, a couple poses. Remembering what you’d seen on the bookshelf, an idea comes to you and you turn away from the mirror. Heading over to the bookshelf, selecting from it a number of the Angelina Ballerina books, you sat down and open them with the intention of only looking at the pictures to see if you could copy what was there.<br />
<br />
Soon losing interest in the pictures, you become engrossed in the books of the little mouse girl. When you exhausted them, you moved on to the rest of books, stopping after a bit to fetch the plush puppy, and, after some thought, the Angelina plush as well as a fawn-coloured horse with three candies stitched on its side, like it had a tattoo. Returning to the books, setting the toys next to you as you read, you lost track of time and before you knew it, Julie was knocking on the door, telling you she’d fixed you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch with some apple slices.</p>
