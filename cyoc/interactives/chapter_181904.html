<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Atlantis…we are in Atlantis?” inquired Oscar<br />
<br />
“I think…we need to find a place to rest and gather ourselves.” Advised Stacy as everyone looked around, they were in what remained of a market, it wasn’t wooden stands which surrounded them but something that looked like coral but the results where the same. They were floating in the middle of what seamed to be an abounded lost city. <br />
<br />
“I would recommend we check out the pyramid but I don’t think that is best place to rest.” Advised Barbara as she pointed toward a large pyramid located on the other side of the market where a glowing orb floated above the peak giving off basically a late afternoon sunlight. <br />
<br />
“In horror movies, going to check out the ancient temple in the center of an ancient city is the for sure fire way to get killed by some monster.”<br />
<br />
“It is also where they find the answers, but I agree let’s not go check out that building yet at least.” Confirmed Stacy as she looked around and even swam a little bit away from the group, not far maybe 20 feet which only took her 2 or 3 powerful kicks to get that distance. <br />
<br />
“I think I see a house of some kind.” Said Stacy as she began to go that way Barbara following her.<br />
<br />
“Sure…lets go check out the abounded house in the middle of an abounded city?” stated Elizabeth but she followed as well. <br />
<br />
The house or whatever it was did look mostly intact, it looked to be three stories tall with the roof seemly still intact and some busted windows. The doors where open and everything was dark within. <br />
<br />
“This looks real safe, and how are we suppose to see inside, we can’t start a fire underwater.” Stated Elizabeth then she looked around at the other buildings, all of them either had fallen in walls or missing roofs. “I take that back; this is our best bet but we need light of some kind.”<br />
<br />
“I got something.” announced Oscar as he swam down to the ground and moved some sand aside to show cobblestones and some kind of lamp, inside was a rock. He looked at it for a few moments before twisting the rock in its placement, instantly a glow brighter then firelight but not the equal of the electric lights they were used to begin to radiate from the rock.  <br />
<br />
The door was arched and instead of a wooden door, there was a door which looked like it was made from coral of some kind. Once inside they closed the door to make sure no one followed them in. The room was a hallway, and the entire place was trashed, so they went into the nearest room. It was trashed as well with furniture and the like destroyed, sand covering the stone floor and the entire place was horrible. The one good thing was all the windows had stain glass in them showing scenes of merman, mermaids and different sea creatures were still intact. <br />
<br />
“A mirror.” Announced James as he looked at himself in a dirty grim covered mirror. There was a mad rush as everyone tried to get their first look at themselves in this mirror. <br />
<br />
Lindsay finally got to see herself, she knew she was wearing a red tube top with crisscrossing straps which rapped around her neck and she could see her dark red, blood red and black tail but seeing them all together in this mirror was something else. Her skin looked perfect, her dark red hair now looked even better, she had a pixie cut but now parts of it was longer which made it look even better. Her neck was longer and for a moment she was transfixed watching the water flow out of the gills on her neck. Her arms seamed lightly longer, and her fingernails looked perfect even with the red webbing between her fingers. Her bust had grown a bit but not over the top, maybe a half cup size and she looked like she had a stronger core. It kind of reminded her of how she imagined an elf version of herself would look like, she half expected to see pointed ears, but her ears remained the same. She even still had her earrings on. Past that her scales took over, it was not a clean line, there were some scales above the bulk of scales and so on. <br />
<br />
“You look good.” said Oscar, he flushed a bit but hid it quickly. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Lindsay trying to hide her blush. Slowly everyone finally got a good look at them knew bodies. <br />
<br />
“So what now?” inquired Elizabeth “We need to find a way to fix this?”<br />
<br />
“I think first we need to find food and figure out how to live as merfolk.” Countered Stacy as she came to rest on a stone bench. It sat higher then a normal bench would but their tails where longer than legs. <br />
<br />
“Best way to do that is to explore the city.” Said Lindsay<br />
<br />
“I think I may have something that could help us.” Announced James as he waved everyone over to a large table which while covered with seaweed and sand was still standing. Behind glass was a large map of what had to be Atlantis before the fall. It was in the language of the merfolk’s but once again they all could read it like it was English.<br />
<br />
“Central Market, that is where we are.” Said Barbara as she pointed to near the center of the city. There was a dozen other smaller markets each with their own name. <br />
<br />
“Temple of the Seven Seas.” Read Lindsay as she pointed to the pyramid in the center. “That is in the center of the city and has that glowing orb over it.” <br />
<br />
“And on the other side is Government Forum.” added Oscar “We may be able to find out what happened to us there.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should go here.” Offered Stacy as she pointed to a large building a few districts over in another square. “Atlantis Royal University, that may be our best bet to find out what happened to us.”<br />
<br />
“Or maybe we should figure out if we are alone, there are many residential areas.” Advised Elizabeth “If there are people here, they could help us.”<br />
<br />
“Or hurt us, there are guard stations, I assume they are like police stations marked, we should try there to get stuff to protect ourselves.” Advised James “Whatever we do I don’t think we should split up if we don’t have to, if this is to scale this city looks massive.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed, so where do we go?” inquired Oscar</p>
