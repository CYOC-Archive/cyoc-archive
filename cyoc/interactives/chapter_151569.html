<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His changes stopped for a few moments so both brother and sister can take it all in. One happy and satisfied. The other terrified and shocked. Neither one of them fully understanding how the other feels. But only one is able to express it in the complex language of a human. All the other can do, is make the unintelligible braying of a jackass. &quot;Eeerrrrgghhh hhhhaaawww eeerrrgg hhhaaawww eerrrggghhh hhhhaaawww.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gleefully the sister, Kat, told Jeff he might want to stand up on both of his legs, as it would be the last few moments he gets to relish such an experience before he would be irrevocably degraded to standing around on all fours forever. Braying, Jeff tries to stand up on his own to attack his godless sister. But his humungus sensitive donkey penis was getting in the way. So was his overweight frame he is totally not used to dealing with. All he&#39;s able to do, is to paw around on the ground, gripping mud and grass between his large 40 year-old man hands. <br />
<br />
He eventually manages to get to his knees, long donkey tail swishing on the wet ground. He puts his right leg underneath himself, bare foot pressed into the muddy, wet ground. But he feels joint pain in that knee as well as his back, and uses his right hand to push up on that knee like an old fat man might do. He attempted to get his left foot under his obscenely heavy 400lb frame. He ended wobbling and falling back over onto the ground. Letting out a series of frustrated braying. <br />
<br />
Kat stood there, laughing at the ridiculous sight. The faces he makes whenever he attempts to speak and the sound that comes out instead. She sees him biting at something invisible in the air, his large black rubbery donkey lips dancing every which way, as if unsure how to use them to form unspoken words.<br />
<br />
His brain knew what he wanted to say. What he was trying to say. Unfortunately, his vocal and mouth structure would never allow the words to escape his lips. Nobody will ever understand what his ridiculous irritating brays mean. &quot;Eeerrrrgghhh hhhaaww eeeerrggghhh hhhaawe eeerrrgggg hhhaaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughter subsiding but still highly amused, she used one of the first spells she learned to help him in getting his feet under him. A levitation spell. <br />
<br />
She lifted the heavy 80% donkey frame up so he could straighten his legs to stand on his own two feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;After this, I will never help you stand back up again. You&#39;ll just have to figure out how to do it on your own, and get used to it. By that time, you&#39;ll be down on all fours anyways!&quot;<br />
<br />
She gently set him down. Squinting through his poor monochrome oversized donkey irises, he tries to glare at her. But again, donkey faces are not &quot;designed&quot; to convey any sort of meaning. His eyes just have the dull, stupid look of a jackass. Which will make the world completely unaware of the intelligence behind those eyes from now on. <br />
<br />
Again, attempting to speak, his vocal chords and shape of his mouth trapped the words, and only conveyed the distinct braying of an irritated donkey&quot;eerrrgghhh hhhaaww eerrgghh hhhaawwww!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, each time you try to talk, it just makes you sound stupid. You know you&#39;ll never be able to form words ever again. Haha,&quot; she teased.<br />
<br />
He wanted to reach out to choke her, but as he pulled his right arm up, his fingers shrank. Wrists, elbows, and forearms all  extended. As his fingers shrank, the keratin-coated hooves broke though the top of his diminishing man hand. The hoof connecting to the wrist, as the hand shriveled up into the wrist and disappeared.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his....Uuummm....&quot;arm&quot;....was getting longer and less mobile. Same with his &quot;wrist,&quot; which was quickly turning into an ankle. <br />
<br />
All of this was quite painful, especially when the skin of his hand shredded. As this was occurring, he was bent over, holding his deforming arm and crying out forcefully and loudly: &quot;HHHHHAAAWWW EEERRRGGHHH HHHHAAAWWW EEERRRGGGHHH HHHAAWWW&quot; <br />
<br />
As the pain in his right &quot;arm&quot; subsided, he stood back up again and tried flexing his fingers. Alas, he had no fingers! Tried flexing his hand, but donkeys have no hands either! He stood up, and his arm was extended straight out from the core of his body, with the hoof pointed slightly downward at the ankle. <br />
<br />
He tried bringing his arm back close to his body, but the range of motion was quite limited. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhhaaww eeerrrgghh hhaawww EEERRGGHHH hhaaaww!,&quot; he spoke quite unintelligibly. <br />
<br />
His penis began to stand erect, growing longer and longer and longer. It pointed accusingly at Kat, like an angry one-eyed snake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeewwwww!!! You might want to put that....THING!....away!,&quot; she said in mock-disgust. Knowing full well he can&#39;t &quot;put it away.&quot; Not ever.<br />
<br />
Her words carried with them a curse of humiliation. Jeff immediately brought his left arm, the only one he has left, and his right foreleg, down to cover himself up as much as possible. That only drew more of his sister&#39;s attention! His manhand, as large as it was, was entirely too small to even begin to cover a fully-erect donkey&#39;s penis! He was only able to grip half of the base of the thing, which made him very horny, as well as incredibly humiliated! <br />
<br />
It looked like he was playing with himself. But even whatever small bit of modesty his left hand was able to cover, it soon began to join his right hoof. <br />
<br />
Going through the same process as before, Dan once again doubled over in pain, eerrgghh hhhaawwwiing the entire time. This new development brought his levels of lust to new heights. <br />
<br />
His left foreleg now finished, he stands back up on the only human body part left to him: his feet. And the only dignity left: the ability to stand upright. As he stands back up, both of his much-longer and less useful front legs stick straight out from his fat, mostly donkey torso. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghh hhhaaww eerrrgghhh hhhaaww eeerrrrgghhh hhhaawwww,&#39; he says, attempting to negotiate.. Frustrated by the fact that he now has hooves instead of hands! Legs instead of arms! And. Oh God, his giant dick was burning with lust and his black softballs tingling with hot, churning, yellowish donkey cum.  And in full view of his sister!<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you&#39;ll never play any of your video games ever again . You&#39;ll have those HOOVES and those LEGS for a while! Hahaha! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, not like you&#39;d be playing your games anyway. Your room is now my study, and your games and gaming console no longer exists. All that progress you&#39;ve made on your silly little RPG and sports games? All gone! Just like all your hard school work! You&#39;ll never have any use for those things ever again! All you need to know, is how to follow orders in plowing huge tracts of farmland somewhere in Amish country. You&#39;ll be doing that, while I get to go to the beach as a reward for the money we earn by selling you to the Amish. You&#39;ll be doing back-breaking labor, while we are all soaking up the sun and fishing on a yacht.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way she was cruelly rubbing in his fate was meant to make him feel dejected and hopeless. Make him submissive, like all animals lower on the tree of life are supposed to be. Especially the lowly donkey, Dan&#39;s newly permananently assigned species. <br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t all over yet. Still two final indignities left. They&#39;ll occur at the same time.<br />
<br />
As he was contemplating his fate and what all donkeys look like, what he now looks like, and what they&#39;re supposed to do such as him, he felt a tingling in his feet. And at his waist. His ankles both started growing longer, and it felt like he was being forced to stand on his tip-toes. At the same time, his waist became longer, and his hips wider. With his hips widening, his rump started ballooning out, gaining more mass. Muscle and fat. This is where his final 280 lb weight gain will come from. <br />
<br />
As he was being lifted on his tip-toes and his hips widening, he started leaning forward. But then, like with his hands, his feet skin was stretching on top and tearing. New hooves were stretching outward, it&#39;s joints with it&#39;s ankle getting longer and larger. His human feet were shrinking. Eventually, all of his weight was slowly transferring on onto his newly-developed rear hooves.<br />
<br />
His spinal cord began to crack as it elongated. Adding new vertebrae along it&#39;s length. His hips continue to widen in order to accommodate his much heavier, wider body. His rump enlarging as his intestines makes its final changes to full donkeyhood as his hole turned black and moved a bit up his rump and much closer to his spinal column and base of his tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is it! This is the very final moment you&#39;ll ever be on two legs! You better relish it, because in less than 20 seconds, you&#39;ll be stuck on all fours forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EEERRGGHHH HHHAAWWW EEERRRGGHHH HHHAAWWW EEERRRGGHHH HHAAWW!!!&quot; Jeff screamed unintelligibly. <br />
<br />
He continued to tip further and further forward, and his ass end raised higher and higher. Almost like the ass end of the Titanic. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his penis and balls made one last change, as they migrated up closer to his deep dark butt hole. From the right angle and with tail out of the way, you&#39;d see his low-hanging, softball-sized black balls hanging from the rear. Only his tail will give him some cover from now on.<br />
<br />
And finally, the penultimate moment:<br />
His front hooves connected with the wet grass and mud with a loud, soft &quot;thud!&quot;<br />
<br />
His rump putting on the last few pounds of fat and muscle, and Dan is finally a full donkey in body! Even if not in mind! A fully grown, middle aged 680 lb African jackass with joint pains. Joint pains he will be forced to endure and work through. Joint pains hell be unable to say anything about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghhh HHHAAWW eerrrgghhh hhaawww EEERRGGHHH HHHAAWW eerrrgghhh hhhaaaw&quot;</p>
