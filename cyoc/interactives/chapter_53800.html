<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick sat in his cabin writing down what happened in his own blood. He knew this was cheating a bit and he figured he knew the price he would be paying. He had wrote a farewell note to Maylene explaining what happened and why she wouldn't remember him if he was right. He paused in his writing and sighed. He had decided to write down what happened when his memories started changing. The biggest memory change was that there was always Lupmans, Leomans, Felmans, Gargoyles, and Golden Deer. He still knew they hadn't always existed but that knowledge was fading fast. The other change he was aware of was in the new reality Samantha hadn't come onto the boat and forced them to go to the island. Instead a few of the passengers were going there to help record the experiment with the Golden Deer and they were caught up in Kurse's little war. He sighed and went back to writing. At least he knew that this would enable him to keep a record of what really happened even when he didn't remember it anymore. He was thankful that his mom and sister had been witches before they were killed. His mom had taught him about magic and the infinite chaos right along with his sister. She had said that he did posses the gift but it was dormant because he was a boy and very few boys who possess the gift are able to use it.<br />
<br />
Rick paused again and thought about the infinite chaos and Marie. Quite a few of the passengers and crew were afraid of Marie and that fear was justified. Marie had been immersed directly into the infinite chaos by Kurse. It's amazing that she didn't immediately go mad. That probably wouldn't last though. He thought about how he caught her crying in the mirror. He had seen her watching as he proposed to Maylene and then run off. He had followed and when he found her crying he guessed it was because she might not be able to get married.<br />
<br />
Rick shook his head and went back to writing since he could feel his memories slipping more. He had to get this done before he forgot. He paused again as he saw his writing was getting lower on the page. He looked at himself and sighed since he could see that he was getting younger. &quot;So this is how it's going to be,&quot; he said shaking his head, &quot;I'm going to be a kid again and won't be able to marry Maylene.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick put the quill down and took off his clothes since they didn't seem to be changing with him. Once he had his clothes off he went back to writing trying to keep the words in a straight line. He breathed a sigh of relief as he finished writing down everything just as he seemed to finish transforming. However as he sat back he noticed his dick get smaller until he couldn't really see it and then a gash opened between his legs. &quot;Well I certainly won't be marrying Maylene as a little girl,&quot; Rick said sighing. &quot;At least she'll know how I feel even though she won't remember me. But why did I transform into a little girl?&quot; He had figured his marriage to Maylene wouldn't happen if he wrote things down. He could understand being turned into a little boy since that would be the path of least resistance. Reality couldn't change someone's feelings easily and since he did get on the boat in the original timeline he still had to have boarded in this timeline. But why a girl? As he sat there and pondered it he didn't notice the blond fur cover his body or his toes and balls of his feet turn into paws. He didn't notice his legs rearrange themselves to become digitigrade. He only noticed he was changing further when he saw a muzzle push out of his face.<br />
<br />
Rick suddenly sprang up and looked at himself. &quot;I'm turning into a wolf girl,&quot; he said in shock. &quot;This isn't the path of least resistance though so how can this be happening? It isn't logical unless...&quot; He quit fighting the new memories and opened himself up to them. He immediately knew what had happened. He was Martin's twin brother in the new timeline which made sense since he would need different parents. What startled him though was the battle had gone a bit differently. Instead of Glass going into the mirror world with Abbey by themselves he had tagged along. He had hit his head and was knocked out the moment he entered. When Abby had knocked out Glass she had a moment of indecision of which to take out first. That moment of indecision is what sealed both of their fates as they didn't get out before Kurse was killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'll need a new name,&quot; Rick said as he completed his transformation into a glass wolf girl. Should he pick a name beginning with R or a totally different name though? After a few seconds he said, &quot;My name is Richelle now.&quot; She looked around at the now empty cabin and said, &quot;I should get back to Mommy. She'll be worried about me like she is Marie.&quot; She climbed up onto the table and stepped through the mirror. Once on the other side she smiled as she saw her dress was red with black runes. That made sense since Martin and Rick liked to dress alike but opposite. Their favorite shirts were a yellow tee with a black smiley face for Rick and a black tee with a yellow smiley face for Martin. It made sense that their dresses in the mirror world would be the same but opposite. &quot;Though mirror world is a little bland I think,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;It should be looking glass world like looking glass house in Through the Looking Glass. Now to Mommy before she worries herself sick.&quot; She took three steps and found herself in the reflection of her cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richelle, have you seen your sister?&quot; Eliza asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen her Mommy,&quot; Richelle said. &quot;I think I might know where she is though. I'll go find her for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do,&quot; Eliza said. &quot;Tell her that Mommy wants her to come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will be back Mommy,&quot; Richelle said smiling, &quot;and so will I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still worry though,&quot; Eliza said smiling. &quot;Now go to your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Richelle turned she sighed and looked down at her paw. There was a cut on it but she knew better than to try to write everything down in her blood again. Her blood turns to glass in the outside world which makes it hard to read if it remains intact. Setting her mind on wolf manor she walks out of the cabin mirror and into a mirror in wolf manor.</p>
