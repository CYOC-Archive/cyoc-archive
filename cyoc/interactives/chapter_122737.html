<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Josh was slacking off, playing a video game while he slumped down into the couch, when his girlfriend Mandy came into their apartment.  She groaned and threw her bag across the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, babe?&quot; asked Josh, not bothering to look away from the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s work... again.  I just can&#39;t seem to attract customers the way I used to.  I mean, I should be the star, the center of attention.  I work harder than any of the other girls,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
Mandy worked as a stripper.  Most guys would not have allowed their partner to display their nude body for strangers.  But Josh thought it was pretty cool.  For one thing, the money was great.  Josh got to laze around the apartment all day while Mandy slept and play video games all night while she performed at the club.  She made more than enough money for both of them. Plus, Mandy was super hot, with a body that only seemed to get more attractive every day.  So what if other guys drooled over her, dreaming of having sex with her?  Josh got to enjoy the real thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad, &quot; said Josh as he continued to mash buttons. Mandy was always complaining about her looks. It was nothing new.  But the money kept flowing so Josh didn&#39;t worry too much about her complaints.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am serious, Josh.  I am really worried.  I am supposed to go to the convention this weekend.  I even paid for a booth.  But how will I get noticed there if I can&#39;t even get noticed at work?&quot; whined Mandy.<br />
<br />
That finally got Josh&#39; attention. <br />
<br />
A few months ago Mandy decided she wanted to get into adult films, believing that was where the &#39;real money&#39; was.  She had raved to Josh about how the porn stars not only got paid for their film work, but also for personal appearances, sex toy endorsements and even for autographs.  Plus, once she was a famous porn star, Mandy could charge a premium fee to strip club owners for the opportunity to book her to dance at their club.  Josh supported Mandy&#39;s decision.  Well, he supported it as long as he didn&#39;t have to do any work.<br />
<br />
Mandy had been working hard to make contacts in the industry, but had little success.  Fate smiled on her, however, when the Triple XXX Con rolled into town, one of the largest adult entertainment conventions in the country.  She spent quite a bit to rent a small booth in the vendors area, hoping to catch the eye of a producer.  Josh had begged Mandy to let him go with her, but she had insisted that he stay home.  This was not supposed to be fun, it was a business opportunity.  <br />
<br />
But now Josh saw his own opportunity presenting itself. Josh paused his game, put down the controller and gave Mandy his full attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I could go with you.  Help you promote yourself,&quot; said Josh.<br />
<br />
Mandy gave Josh a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet, honey.  But - no offense - I don&#39;t think you are the kind of person they are looking for,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
Josh wasn&#39;t offended.  He knew he was lucky to have a girl as hot as Mandy.  Josh wasn&#39;t an ugly guy, but he wasn&#39;t exactly a stud either.  He wasn&#39;t fat, but he didn&#39;t have a lean, muscular body with rock hard abs and a smooth chest.  And although he wasn&#39;t small, he knew his penis couldn&#39;t compete with the monsters that belonged to the male porn stars who would be attending.  In short, Josh was just really average.<br />
<br />
Defeated, he turned back to his video game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you could bring another girl, somebody from work,&quot; said Josh as he returned to his game.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could, but I don&#39;t trust anybody enough.  One of the other girls might hog the spotlight and try to steal away any jobs,&quot; said Mandy wistfully.  &quot;Besides, that lesbian stuff is so old and tired. I need something new, a gimmick that will really get everyone&#39;s attention....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a sister?  I mean, it&#39;s kind of sick but also a little kinky, &quot; said Josh as he continued to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww, that&#39;s gross. She is way too much of a prude anyway.  Besides, no one would know we were sisters unless we told them. It would look like every other lesbian act,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad you don&#39;t have a twin.  Twins are really sexy and they always get a lot of attention, &quot; said Josh.<br />
<br />
Mandy squealed and jumped on the couch, landing next to Josh. She startled him, causing Josh to lose his game.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, you are a genius! Will you do me a favor?  A really big favor?&quot; said Mandy, giving Josh her best puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, babe.  You know I would do anything for you,&quot; said Josh.<br />
<br />
Mandy gave Josh a big kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much, sweetie! Wait here, I will be right back,&quot; said Mandy as she jumped up off the couch and ran into her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Josh smiled.  Maybe he was going to get to go to the Triple XXX convention after all.  Josh was getting a little excited at the thought of being surrounded by all of those beautiful women.  But what was Mandy doing in there?  Was she going to try on some crazy costume? Some exotic lingerie?  Or maybe bondage gear?<br />
<br />
Josh was little disappointed when Mandy returned holding up a small medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now I know this is going to sound crazy, but hear me out.  This medallion has magical powers.  If you touch it to a person&#39;s clothing, your body will be altered to look like that person.  If you touch it to clothes that have never been worn, your body will adjust to fit the clothes. I have kind of been using it to touch up my body over the last few weeks - you know, a larger bra for a bigger bust, a corset for a narrow waist and wider hips, that kind of thing.  I am a little surprised you didn&#39;t notice,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
Josh was surprised, too.  Sure he thought Mandy looked a little better lately.  But he hadn&#39;t noticed any drastic changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right - I do think you are crazy. But for the sake of argument let&#39;s say I believe you.  What does that have to do with the convention?  Or me for that matter?&quot; said Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &quot; said Mandy, blushing a little. &quot; I was kind of hoping......&quot;</p>
