<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And Bigby,&quot; Balthilde spoke, just as he made it to the door, &quot;as glad as I am to see that you will be associating more with the pack, do you remember where each Pack member lives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bigby paused and looked back to his elder and her granddaughter, who was still sitting down. He noticed a sort of look of recognition on her face. He didn't know what it was, but figured that Elder Balthilde would be busy helping Sarah get used to being a werewolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured I'd go to where we normally meet, and attract their attention,&quot; Bigby spoke after a moment or to, &quot;let you work with your granddaughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While you're still in wolf form?&quot; Balthilde lowered one triangular ear in confusion, &quot;the wolf that does the most to protect the pack, even to the point of mistaking a pack-mate for a human and then scarring her grandmother, will attract human attention by howling during the day? There are human woodsmen that do come into the Forest to cut down trees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bigby hung his head again when he remembered the humans that came into the woods, chopped down trees, and then left. They were commonly the sort that Bigby tried to chase off to protect the pack's woods. Dealing with them took a lot of work and effort to make sure when he did do it, there was no massive human response. But the present incident was enough to show that the way he had behaved may not have been the best way to handle the situation. He had run into Sarah, while she was still in human form, and not knowing she was already a member of the pack, went off to attack her grandmother, thinking that Sarah and thus her grandmother were humans out to take away the woods from the pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; Bigby then admitted.<br />
<br />
Balthilde walked over to a small desk and began fishing out a pen and a piece of paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll draw you a map which will have all the locations of pack members' homes on in in relation to the town,&quot; Balthilde spoke, &quot;I'll let you talk with Sarah while I'm busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Bigby said nervously.<br />
<br />
He then looked over to Sarah who was sitting down. Her hair had gone from blond to a light gray, her musculature had grown much larger, as had her breasts. Her hips were wider, and he could see an inner &quot;wildness&quot; in her that her human form didn't have.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's so beautiful,&quot; Bigby thought nervously to himself.<br />
<br />
Sarah, meanwhile sat quietly where her grandmother had explained things to her. Seeing Bigby, and more importantly, smelling him, something about the wolf Bigby struck her as familiar. He had a friend that was known by that name, and something in Bigby's scent made Sarah think that the wolf Bigby was him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He must have transformed,&quot; Sarah thought to herself, &quot;he transformed and decided not to come back... or was too scared to... he sure turned out sexy though...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah found herself blushing as that thought went through her mind as she examined his broad chest and practically perfect musculature, as well as the impressive sheath between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're blushing,&quot; Bigby said to her, &quot;the fur on your cheeks is now dark gray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sarah said looking down for a moment, &quot;Bigby, do you remember me? Or at least remember a girl named Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I remember a young girl that I was friends with when I was younger,&quot; Bigby admitted, &quot;we did a lot of things together growing up... heh... heh... I remember a day we chased Mrs. Fogsworth's mangy cat up a scraggly pine tree after it'd decided to steal Sarah's fish sticks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah gave a half chuckle at that. She and Bigby had been having a sort of picnic outside of school when the cat had come out of nowhere, took a fish stick and ran off with it. She and Bigby then chased it about the school yard till it went up a pine tree near the edge of the school yard. As she remembered it, the cat didn't come down for the rest of the day. It never returned the fish stick, but something in Sarah's mind felt very proud at chasing the cat up a tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe my inner wolf was always there,&quot; Sarah thought to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you chuckling at?&quot; Bigby wondered, as he caught on to Sarah's chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just thinking back on the memory,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;you nearly got that cat that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bigby blinked at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Bigby asked, &quot;the Sarah I knew was a little girl, and a human girl! We were friends, and good friends... but my own abilities manifested one day a few years ago and I could never see her again. She'd be afraid of me now and would certainly send hunters to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah got up and moved slowly toward him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know about that because I was there,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;The cat stole my fish stick and you gave chase to defend me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're saying...&quot; Bigby began to gasp.<br />
<br />
Sarah then approached him and placed her hands just above his tail and held him to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm saying the Sarah you knew was a bit more wolfish then you thought,&quot; Sarah said, &quot;because I AM that Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah?!&quot; Bighby asked as Sarah felt his tail begin to wag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Sarah said back and began to wag her own tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is you!&quot; Bigby gave out a great exclamation, &quot;It is you! Oh, it's been so long!&quot;<br />
<br />
He then pulled Sarah into a very firm hug, feeling her breasts push against his chest. He then began to lick her face and muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you at least send me a message?&quot; Sarah asked him as she began to lick him back, &quot;my parents never said to be wary of wolves... I know now because I was one... in a way... I wouldn't have been afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the time, I was still a bit scared at what I became,&quot; Bigby answered, &quot;I was out chasing fireflies one night, when I was hit by a sudden pain. When it stopped, I was as I was now. I was afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt a bit afraid too,&quot; Sarah said, &quot;I changed just after you left. I'd gotten a drink out of a well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The magic well,&quot; Bigby chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma says it's just water,&quot; Sarah answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of its direct properties... yes, but we commonly have a lot of definitions for magic,&quot; Bigby commented, &quot;my parents supposedly took each other as mates at that well, and from what my dad has said, that night was magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we'll have a night that is magical like that,&quot; Sarah said with a smile and gave a slow sensual lick of the side of Bigby's muzzle.<br />
<br />
This time, Bigby was the one who blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-hem,&quot; came Balthilde's voice from beside them.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Bigby pulled away from their hug. Balthilde then handed a sheet of paper to Bigby. It had a fairly detailed map of the village and the area around it. &quot;Xs&quot; marked the houses of members of the Pack with their names on it. Balthilde's home was in the woods to the south of the village, and Sarah could even see the home she shared with her parents to the east of the village in a different part of the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the list, Elder Balthilde,&quot; Bigby spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Balthilde commented, &quot;Off with you now. You and Sarah can resume your childhood courtship later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah gave a sigh as Bigby then licked her goodbye, submissively bowed to her grandmother, looked out the window and then went out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see him again, Sarah,&quot; Balthilde said to him, &quot;In the meantime, we have some training to put you through... so you know about the Pack, know who is in the Pack, as well as controlling your own transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Grandma,&quot; Sarah admitted.</p>
