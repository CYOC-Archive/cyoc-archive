<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He took another look in the mirror and was surprised to see that his ears had elongated slightly, the tips now pointed and furry. His nose had also grown a bit, slightly flattened, and a slight snout was forming. His eyes had changed, too, becoming more piercing and slightly more wolf-like. Steve&#39;s heart raced with excitement and fear. He was turning into something else, something more than human.<br />
<br />
He decided to go out, to see if anyone noticed his changes. He put on a loose shirt and pants, trying to cover up as much as he could. The fabric rubbed against his new fur, sending waves of pleasure through his body. He stepped outside into the cool morning air, and the smells of the city assaulted him—garbage, car exhaust, and the faint scent of a nearby bakery. The noises were louder, more pronounced. His hearing had also changed, sharper and more acute.<br />
<br />
Walking down the street, Steve felt the eyes of passersby lingering on him, but no one said anything. Maybe they thought he was just a hipster with a good costume. His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden growl from his stomach. The hunger was intense, like he hadn&#39;t eaten in days. He followed the scent of fresh bread to the bakery and bought a loaf, tearing into it with his teeth, the crust crackling and the warm dough giving way to his new, powerful jaws.<br />
<br />
The woman at the counter gaped at him, and he realized he&#39;d forgotten to pay. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he mumbled, fishing out his wallet. His voice had deepened, gruffer, and he had to fight the urge to snarl at her as she took his money. The taste of the bread was heavenly, the smell of it mingling with his fur. He felt like an animal, and he liked it.<br />
<br />
Back in his apartment, Steve decided to explore his new body further. He stripped off his clothes, letting the fabric slide over his furry body. His cock was now a monster, thick and veiny, and the sight of it made his heart race. He stroked it gently, watching the fur on his body ripple and shift with every touch. As he grew more aroused, his features began to change again, his teeth sharpening, his nose elongating further into a snout.<br />
<br />
The fur grew in even thicker, coating his legs and feet in a soft, warm layer that tickled as he moved. His toes had become slightly clawed, and the hair grew denser around his ankles and wrists. He couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing, but the pleasure was too intense to stop. His strokes grew faster, his hips bucking as he watched his body change. His ears had moved up his head, now pointed and covered in fur, and his eyes had taken on a yellow tint, gleaming with lust.<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s body was now a canvas of fur, his cock standing proudly in the center. He was a creature of lust and power, and he reveled in it. The orgasm built within him, a pressure cooker about to blow its lid. He could feel the fur on his back stand on end as his muscles tensed, and then it hit him like a freight train. Cum spurted out of him in thick ropes, coating the floor and the lower half of the bathroom door. He bellowed his release, the sound echoing through the apartment like a howl.<br />
<br />
As the pleasure subsided, Steve felt his body begin to change again. His legs grew longer, more muscular, and hairier, and his feet morphed into paws with sharp claws. The fur on his back thickened into a mane that trailed down his spine, and his eyes shifted to a more wolf-like hue. He looked down at his hands, now covered in fur and tipped with claws, and felt an overwhelming sense of power.<br />
<br />
He stepped closer to the mirror, watching as the last vestiges of his humanity melted away. His nose and mouth merged into a snout, and his teeth grew sharp and pointed. His eyes were now a piercing yellow, and his pupils had narrowed to slits. The transformation was complete; he was now more wolf than man. The only thing that remained unchanged was his massive, fur-covered cock, which still stood at attention.<br />
<br />
Steve felt a thrill of excitement and a touch of fear as he took in his new form. He was powerful, untamed. His skin itched and tightened as his body continued to shift, the fur growing thicker and more pronounced with every passing moment. He had to admit, it was exhilarating. The way his paws felt against the cold tile floor, the way his tail swished with every move he made.<br />
<br />
He decided to test out his new body, his new...abilities. He went to the living room and tried to jump onto the couch, expecting to land with a clumsy thump. But to his astonishment, he leaped with the grace of a seasoned acrobat, landing on the cushions without a sound. His new muscles rippled beneath his fur, and he couldn&#39;t help but pant with excitement. He felt like he could take on the world. Or at least, the local park.<br />
<br />
The next evening, Steve in his wolfish state and ventured outside. The city at night was a cacophony of sounds and smells that his enhanced senses picked up with ease. The scent of a nearby alley cat sent his instincts into overdrive, and he found himself stalking it, his tail low and his eyes focused. The thrill of the hunt was intoxicating, and he felt alive in a way he never had before. The cat, sensing the danger, took off, and Steve chased after it, his paws barely touching the ground.<br />
<br />
The alleyways were a blur of shadow and light as he pursued his prey, his powerful legs eating up the distance with ease. His heart pounded in his chest, not just from the exertion but from the sheer excitement of being in this form. It was like nothing he had ever experienced—his human mind was in awe of the animal instincts that now governed him. When he finally caught the cat, he felt a brief pang of guilt before the hunger took over, and he devoured it whole. The taste of raw meat was surprisingly delicious, and he reveled in the satisfaction of a successful hunt.</p>
