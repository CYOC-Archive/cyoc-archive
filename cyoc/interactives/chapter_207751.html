<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spark woke up in a bed that seemed very unfamiliar to her, she looked around to see a very lavish bedroom that was fitting for someone more in-line with being a princess than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Spark said as she stood up and saw that she was a grown woman wearing a lavish night gown. Suddenly, there was a knock at her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, come in?&quot; Spark called out as her sisters, Star and Midna stepped into the room both looking like grown women, more mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god. Star, Midna, do you two know what&#39;s going on here?&quot; Spark asked.<br />
<br />
Star and Midna both looked at each other before laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you believe that question, Midna?&quot; Star asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed Star, I can&#39;t believe that Princess Spark doesn&#39;t even remember it&#39;s her wedding day.&quot; Midna declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess? Wedding day?! Wait! I....&quot; Spark tried to argue as Star and Midna began dressing her up in a wedding dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two don&#39;t understand, I&#39;m not a princess, I&#39;m not a bride, and I&#39;m not getting....married.&quot; Spark said as she got a look in a mirror at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look...beautiful.&quot; Spark sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Connor, right? I&#39;m getting married to Connor?&quot; Spark asked excitedly as Spark and Midna were confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know a Connor your highness.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Spark said quietly assuming that they didn&#39;t know him. &quot;Still, I can&#39;t wait to see the looks on mom and dad&#39;s faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a shame your family is being held hostage for this wedding.&quot; Midna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...what? But you&#39;re my family, my sisters.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
Star and Midna looked at each other then at Spark.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re only your ladies in waiting your highness.&quot; Star said as Spark became a little sad now as they put her veil over her face and led her to the throne room. Spark could see her parents, Arion and Nova smiling at their daughter while being surrounded by guards. Spark tried not to cry as she was led to the front where her betrothed stood.<br />
<br />
She could see what kind of tale this was supposed to be. She had been brought up as a princess not by birth, but as adoption. Her parents had no doubt been brought there because she had refused marriage to whoever her husband to be was. She felt alone as she walked down the aisle.<br />
<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t recognize the person and she really didn&#39;t care. After the priest read the vows, Spark was asked if she took the groom.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I....&quot; Spark began to say before a commotion was heard.<br />
<br />
A man dressed in black with a mask and cowl over his face came thrashing through the guards and took out the ones near Arion and Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both must flee quickly, I&#39;ll rescue your daughter.&quot; The man declared to Arion and Nova as Spark heard this too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need too much saving.&quot; Spark said to herself as she through her bridal bouquet at her groom and kicked him away and tried to run before being overwhelmed with guards on every side. Her savior stood next to her now with his sword drawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to step aside, I wouldn&#39;t want you injured before I can return you to your family.&quot; The man in black said.<br />
<br />
Spark grabbed a nearby sword out of the hilt of a guard on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary, I like a little action after every wedding.&quot; Spark said with a smirk. Now she and and her savior dueled against the guards and made their way to the doors of the hall, where they eventually made their escape on a horseback with Spark grasping her hands around the man in black&#39;s waist.<br />
<br />
Eventually they made it out of the city to a hidden part of the forest with Spark still in her wedding dress. It had gotten dark and they had made a fire for the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I know the name of my heroic savior?&quot; Spark asked as the man unveiled himself  and to Spark&#39;s surprise and delight it was Connor as an adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor Moreland of the Moreland clan. My father owed a debt to your family and I thought I&#39;d finally repay it and rescue you out of your forced marriage.&quot; Connor explained as he removed his shirt and his abs were revealed to Spark who felt her heart beat so loudly it would almost pop out of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I feel I owe you a reward for my rescue Connor Moreland.&quot; Spark stated leaning closely to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What did you have in mind Princess Spark?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;First, please just call me Spark. Secondly, since it is my ahem &#39;wedding night&#39; I thought you would do me the honor of giving me a wonderful night?&quot; Spark asked as she began to remove her wedding dress until she was completely naked. <br />
<br />
Connor now obliged and removed his clothes as well and the two of them began making out on the cool night near the fire. With their bodies gently touching the other.<br />
<br />
Spark awoke to see Amara in her cat form nearby though looking a little plumper now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I&#39;d try and make up for you a good dream with a little dread there in the beginning. How was it?&quot; Amara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was...a decent start. But I still don&#39;t like you that much.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The feeling&#39;s mutual.&quot; Amara said as she left Spark&#39;s bedroom, no doubt going back to Nat&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Spark could see it was still early enough, she had to get ready for school and headed to the bathroom and saw the door closed. She knocked on the door and heard Connor on the other side. Connor opened the door and Spark saw he had a towel wrapped around his midsection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Spark, didn&#39;t mean to hog the restroom.&quot; Connor apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, oh no, you....you...take...all the...time....you...want...&quot; Spark tried to say as she began to get a little red in the face and waved her hand to cool it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoo, is it hot in you or something? I mean, is it hot in here? I NEED TO SHOWER NOW!&quot; Spark shouted as she rushed past Connor into the bathroom and hopped into the shower just barely remembering her dream. The most she remembered was the final moments of the dream with Connor and breathed a loving sigh.</p>
