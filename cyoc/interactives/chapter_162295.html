<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was shaking as he pulled his phone out and texted his best friend, Nat. &quot;Get your ass over here, asap&quot; he typed, quickly hitting send and turning back to the computer.  He pulled up a quick change, lengthening his hair, just to make sure it would actually work, and to his delight, in seconds his hair had grown to his ass. His phone buzzed, a response from Nat: &quot;omw, whats up?&quot; Jeff replied back hed see when he got there, and went back to work, planning what he had always wanted to do.<br />
<br />
He had just finished up when he heard Nat bounding up the steps. It had been years of friendship and Nat basically had a blanket invitation, he rarely ever had to knock to get in, like now.  He appeared in the doorway, looking a little frazzled having rushed over, and said &quot;okay, spill, what the hell is so imp...what the hell is with your hair?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oops,&quot; I said, &quot;well it wont be as much of a surprise, then.  Go sit down.&quot; Nat did, and Jeff took the time to admire him as he went by.  Very soon, he thought to himself.  &quot;So, remember when you told me how transforming and shapeshifting and shit turned you on?&quot;  With a bit of an embarrassed blush, Nat nodded.  &quot;So, I got this program thing, called Chronivac.  That&#39;s what happened to my hair.  How awesome is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Nat replied incredulously, &quot;its a wig.  Lame prank, man.&quot;I thought you&#39;d say something like that,&quot; Jeff smirked, punching a key, and turning back to Nat, &quot;so I knew I&#39;d have to change you some.  You&#39;re welcome, by the way.&quot;  <br />
Nat was about to ask what for when he started squirming.  His pants felt a much tighter in the crotch than they did a second before.  Jeff laughed a little, and said &quot;go ahead, take a look.&quot;  Nat looked up sharply, then tentatively pulled his waist band out and looked down.  His cock was definitely bigger.  Not by much, and he had never had reason to complain, but it was definitely bigger now, with more girth.  He gulped, also noticing that his newly enhanced penis was hardening in arousal, and looked back up to Jeff.  &quot;Okay, it works...now what, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled again, and replied, &quot;I&#39;m so glad you asked that. See, about that &quot;man&quot; thing?  I&#39;m not one.  But I was always terrified of even mentioning it, because,&quot; he paused, hitting another button on his keyboard,&quot; then standing up, &quot;I knew I could never be accepted for who I really am, and was terrified to be out as transgender.  But now I not only don&#39;t have to be, but I can be exactly who I want to be.&quot;  Jeff looked at Nat, obviously gobsmacked.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry to spring this on you like this, but you are my oldest friend.  I wanted you to see it.&quot;  <br />
With that, Jeff began to strip.  Within 10 seconds he was standing before Nat, totally naked.  &quot;There&#39;s no point in being embarrassed by what you see, because in a few minutes, you&#39;ll be seeing how I&#39;ve seen myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat finally recovered his voice, asking &quot;this is a lot to take in, but how do see yourself?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for starters, no more Jeff obviously.  You can call me Candi.  And what I am is a huge tittied slut. Oh that feels so good to say out loud.&quot; The newly minted Candi moaned as the changes sped up.  She already had noticeable breasts, her vagina had replaced her penis, and her face had shifted to become gorgeous.  She began to feel herself up.  &quot;Mmmm, these feel better than I imagined.  And they&#39;re only getting bigger and bigger.  Come feel my titties.&quot;  Nat looked at her weird, and she said &quot;look, I know you&#39;re hard as a rock, you can&#39;t exactly hide that thing.  I did this on purpose. I want you to be my first.  I knew watching my transformation would turn you on, especially with the promise we can play around with it more.  I&#39;m going to be very free with my body, that was the whole point, and I want share with you.  Take off your clothes, and come feel me up, come feel them as they grow in to your hands.  Suck on my nipples as they grow...&quot; she trailed off as her own words turned her on, and she began to masturbate right in front of Nat&#39;s face.  <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for her to feel a hand on her right breast and a mouth at her left, and she looked down happily.  Nat was getting naked as he fondled and sucked at her breasts, and she knew she had him.  She was overjoyed because she was going to get good and fucked for the first time.<br />
<br />
She gently broke off his fondling and held up one finger.  She gently led him back to the bed and sat him down, then sank to her knees in front of him, his cock standing gloriously to attention right in front of her.  &quot;I also programmed myself certain skills,&quot; she cooed, and while locking eyes with him, slowly parted her lips and slid down his pole.  She had to hand it to the Chronivac, she shouldn&#39;t have been able to go even halfway, but sure enough, she pulled up to the base of his cock, tonguing his balls, never taking her eyes off Nat&#39;s eyes. &quot;Jesus christ, that&#39;s incredible!&quot; Nat managed to get out, while Candi winked and slid back up and off.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I remember you bragging about how that one girl couldn&#39;t do it, not even close.  So, I wanted to be the best, plus give you a little something you&#39;d never gotten before,&quot; and went back to basically fucking her best friend with her mouth.  She could still feel her titties growing, and she could also feel her mental changes kicking in. She wasn&#39;t going to be an idiot, but she also would never be called smart again. Before she knew it, she heard familiar moans coming from Nat and pulled off his cock.  &quot;Oh yeah, I want your cum on my face, Nat!  Cover me in your cum!&quot; With a loud set of grunts, Nat proceeded to do just that.  Candi giggled glee as the ropes of hot cum landed on her, savoring the parts that got in her mouth.  Once Nat was done, she turned around and got on her hands and knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another surprise for you, you can go again whenever now.  Never get tired, never not get hard.  Come fuck me like the slut I am, Nat, fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat proceeded to do so, until both collapsed from exhaustion, Candi covered in dried cum.</p>
