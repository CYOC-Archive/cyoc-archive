<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oakmoss sighed, he laid on a soft and comfy bed in his and Celestia&#39;s bedroom, the feeling of the leather blanket brushing his strong scales made him feel great, he started rolling around the bed, spreading his wings wide to feel the tender touch of the leather, he tried to fall asleep since he had nothing to do, at first he wanted to do something, but most of the group was occupied with something, Celestia went with Oliver in a private place near a orchard, this made Oakmoss quite happy, one of the things he wished mostly for his Rider is to be happy, and to find someone who loves her equally or if not even much more than him, Luka and Ethel couldn&#39;t stop talking together, Oakmoss knew that both of them started developing a crush, which Karyu quite wanted to assist, willingly searching for the most beautiful flowers to give to Ethel, so he could gift them to Luka, the only ones that weren&#39;t busy in any form were the two hens, Astrid and Hilda, at first Oakmoss wanted to learn more about them, but he was more than certain that if they would see him, they would instantly beg him for a clutch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, it&#39;s better than being cooped up in this room all alone.&quot; Thought Oakmoss as he slowly got up, heading towards Ethel&#39;s room, where the two hens spent their time, at first he expected the two hens to be watching through a window some of the Kilin males, but to his suprise, he saw both of the hens playing a simple game of Chess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Checkmate.&quot; Suddenly said Astrid, as her scaled visage lit up with an impish glee, in response Hilda gave a frustrated growl as she started to fix the Chess board, eventually Astrid saw Oakmoss watching both of them playing the chess game, a smile formed on her lips, &quot;Oh hey sweetie! You can join if you want.&quot; said Astrid, in response, Oakmoss rolled his eyes as he went towards them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what is it sweetie? You finally decided to give us both a clutch?&quot; Asked Hilda seductively, at first Oakmoss wanted to respond to Hilda&#39;s question, but Astrid gave an annoyed growl as she swinged her tail across Hilda&#39;s face, &quot;Ow! What was that for?!&quot; asked Hilda again as she looked at Astrid with an innocent look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must you ask every drake the same question?!&quot; Replied Astrid with an angry voice, &quot;No wonder why every drake feels uncomfortable around us!&quot; she said again, with her voice much calmer, Astrid shook her head multiple times only to then roll her eyes, she approached Oakmoss, &quot;Sorry for Hilda&#39;s behaviour, she&#39;s born this way.&quot; apologized Astrid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse you?! You act almost like me, stop lying!&quot; Protested Hilda, only to be slapped again by Astrid&#39;s tail, Oakmoss had to admit, it was quite an adorable sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what bringed you here?&quot; Asked Astrid as she looked at Oakmoss, with an interested voice and look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just, wanted to know more about you both.&quot; Replied Oakmoss quickly, a small blush formed on his scales, &quot;Is there a problem with that?&quot; He innocently asked, looking at Astrid.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Ofcourse there isn&#39;t!&quot; Replied Astrid with a smile, &quot;Just tell me what you want to know about me or Hilda, so that i won&#39;t tell you something useless.&quot; said Astrid as she waited for Oakmoss to ask her questions.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss thought of a possible question, he quickly sighed, &quot;How does it feel like being a hen?&quot; asked Oakmoss bluntly, with an embarrassed voice, only to then bite his scaled lips, at first Astrid became a little bit suspicious about the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, i never turned into a drake, so i can&#39;t tell you if it feels better than being a drake, but i can tell you that having multiple hot drakes following you around makes you feel like you&#39;re in the center of the attention.&quot; Replied Astrid with a smile, &quot;Are there any other questions?&quot; she asked with the same interested voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, there is one.&quot; Replied Oakmoss, he felt his heart thumping in his chest, he opened his mouth for multiple times, but no words came out, &quot;How does it feel like being mated as a hen?&quot; he asked finally, Astrid&#39;s suspicion grew more and more at those questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels great, being mounted by a drake feels like heaven, and when they climax and fill your womb with seed? Hoho! The feeling will be forever embedded in your mind.&quot; Replied Astrid, &quot;Now, let me ask you a question, you can refuse to answer it if you want to, i won&#39;t be angry.&quot; said Astrid, &quot;Are you thinking about becoming a hen and being fucked by Karyu?&quot; asked Astrid.<br />
<br />
At this question, Oakmoss&#39; heart skipped a beat, the hen caught his intentions, he had no choice but to answer it, even if he tried to find a possible method of escaping that question, Astrid would easly know that he was hiding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, i was pondering if i should become a hen and have a session with Karyu.&quot; Replied Oakmoss, &quot;It&#39;s just... That i love him so much, i want to bear his offsprings.&quot; said Oakmoss, he looked like he was about to cry, Astrid smiled at this as she nuzzled him in an encouraging manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s perfectly understandable.&quot; Said Astrid, &quot;But don&#39;t straight up become a hen! You need to talk to Karyu about this! Maybe he was also thinking about turning into a hen and doing the same with you.&quot; finished Astrid her voice becoming sympathetic with each word.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, i will speak to him about this.&quot; Said Oakmoss with a determined voice, &quot;Thank you for speaking with me Astrid, also thank you Hilda.&quot; finished Oakmoss as a smile formed on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem!&quot; The two hens replied at the same time, both of them tilted their heads in a cute manner, as they watched the teal green drake leaving the room.<br />
<br />
Just as Oakmoss left the room, he saw Ethel outside of his room with Karyu, who was holding a basket of flowers, although Oakmoss hated to do it, he eavesdropped both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Karyu, you&#39;re the best.&quot; Said Ethel as he gave Karyu a friendly pat, &quot;Thank you for helping me with Luka, now you should go to Oakmoss, i bet he&#39;s craving you.&quot; finished Ethel as he looked at Karyu with a smile, at this Oakmoss quickly went to Celestia&#39;s room, and laid on the large bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, you already know i would do anything for my Rider.&quot; Replied Karyu with a smile, &quot;And you&#39;re right, Oakmoss is probably going insane without me being there for him.&quot; said Karyu as he went towards Celestia&#39;s room, being greeted by Oakmoss who was laying on the soft bed, Karyu slowly went towards him and nuzzled him, covering him with three of his great wings, while also entwining his tail with his, &quot;How is my mate feeling?&quot; asked Karyu as he kept nuzzling Oakmoss, being careful to not harm him with his great antler-like horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m alright.&quot; Replied Oakmoss, his heart was racing, he needed to speak with Karyu about what he spoke with Astrid and Hilda, &quot;Karyu, there&#39;s something i wanted to talk about...&quot; said Oakmoss, as a blush formed on his scaled cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it my love?&quot; Asked Karyu as he looked at the teal green drake with a beautiful smile, noticing the blush on his scales.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss didn&#39;t know how to explain it, he had no choice but to bluntly say it, &quot;I-I&#39;ve been thinking about turning into a hen, so i could bear your offsprings.&quot; replied Oakmoss bluntly, this Karyu open his eyes widely, a blush also formed on his black scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-To be honest, i was thinking about turning into a hen also.&quot; Said Karyu, the two of them looked at eachother, both of them chuckling softly, &quot;Well, it&#39;s your choice, you can be the hen or i&#39;ll be the hen.&quot; finished Karyu.</p>
