<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dude! It’s Sunday afternoon, my big foster brother Dustin is out of town, we got no school tomorrow because it’s Easter, and I got no homework…” Ty said, while talking on the phone to his best friend Allen.<br />
<br />
“So? Go watch TV dude!” Allen responded.<br />
<br />
“I spent seven hours watching TV and I’m sick of it now, dude…”<br />
<br />
“Well, how about I come over and we play some video games on your XBOX?”<br />
<br />
“Dude! That’s what I did all day YESTERDAY! I’m BORED!” Ty shouted back at Allen.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you said Dustin’s gone?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah dude, he’s in Jacksonville for his work, I don’t want to bug him when he’s on his business trips, you know?” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
“What about Peter?”<br />
<br />
Ty suddenly had an evil grin on his face. He paused to think for a minute, when he realized that his cousin was studying for his Chemistry test in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Allen, can you come over here, like right now?” Ty asked his buddy.<br />
<br />
Peter was in his bedroom, quietly reading his Chemistry textbook. He was reading through the chapter and started answering the questions at the end of the chapter. When he was done, he grabbed his lab workbook, and started going through the lab assignments.<br />
<br />
“God, this is so much work…” Peter thought, obviously feeling tired of studying for several hours straight, and feeling like he needed a break. <br />
<br />
As soon as he got up, his face turned red, his body became stiff, as all his muscles started to ache! His pectorals and his biceps increased slightly, and his whole face suddenly broke out in sweat.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! What’s this?” he said, as he looked down and noted his larger pecs. He suddenly became incredible thirsty, and he opened the bedroom door and stumbled down the stairs to get some water in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Peter grabbed a plastic cup from the cupboard and he then opened the refrigerator door. He grabbed a plastic water bottle and was about to turn the plastic top off of the bottle, when his biceps suddenly inflated and grew almost by 4 inches! The sudden increase in strength made him break the top off the plastic bottle, spilling almost half the water over his arms and on the tiled kitchen floor!<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! What’s going on here?” he wondered, as he grabbed a kitchen towel and wiped the water from his arms, hands, and from the floor. He then poured the remaining water that was in the broken bottle in the plastic cup, before tossing the empty bottle in the trash can.<br />
<br />
Finally, while standing in the kitchen, he opened his mouth wide, raised the cup with his right hand, and drank the remaining water down with one big gulp.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhhh… That was refreshing!” he said, as he felt the fresh, cold water flowing down his throat.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his skin began to feel really strange; he started to itch all over! Within seconds, water started spraying out of his pores as if he were a human sprinkler! He got his tank top shirt and his shorts soaking wet, while he was spraying water all over himself and the kitchen floor!<br />
<br />
“Whaaaaah!!!” he shouted, as soon as he felt his body becoming drenched by the incredible outburst of water coming from his skin. He was now soaking wet, dripping water all over the kitchen floor like a wet sponge.<br />
<br />
“What a mess! Well I guess I better mop the kitchen floor again!” he mumbled to himself, as he tossed the cup in the kitchen sink. Suddenly, he found himself standing in the kitchen wearing his dry shorts, dry basketball jersey, and his high tops. Not only that, but he also had the incredible urge to go outside, and to just go for a walk. So he walked out the front door and made his way into the street.<br />
<br />
Within moments, however, he started to feel tired and he didn’t understand why. He suddenly felt a warm tingling feeling in his waist, which made him stop walking for a moment. Suddenly his body grew wider! Not only that, once his waist was about 8 inches wider, a stump started growing next to his right leg!<br />
<br />
The stump grew longer and longer, until it formed an exact copy of his right leg, with the same shoe and sock! Suddenly Peter found himself standing on the sidewalk in front of his house with three legs, three feet, wearing three identical basketball shoes. His jersey transformed into the uniform of the Orlando Magic basketball team, and Peter suddenly found himself wearing a pair of sunglasses on his head.<br />
<br />
“Man, this is weird…” he mumbled to himself, as he found himself walking on three legs, with both right legs in unison.<br />
<br />
“This is actually kinda cool, though…” he thought, as he began to like his third leg more and more while he continued to stroll down the sidewalk. He kept on looking down, counting the number of shoes he saw before him. “2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1…” he felt stronger and faster, since the third leg greatly increased his stride and his stability. He was able to stand on his outer legs, while just raising only his middle leg as if he were kicking a soccer ball.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment a girl came on her bike, stopping where Peter was walking. She knew Peter from school, and her name was Carrie. <br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, what’s up with the third leg?” she wondered, while still sitting on her bike while she was standing right next to the basketball player.<br />
<br />
“Well… I… ummm… You can say it was a growth spurt of some kind…” he stuttered, not knowing what to say. Carrie had a slight crush on Peter, and she just loved the way he always got himself into these unusual situations. She was well aware of Peter and his powers, but she tried not to show it directly. She gently stepped of the bike and let the bike rest on the sidewalk. She then walked over to Peter, stopping right in front of him.<br />
<br />
“So, tell me Peter… Is it a coincidence you root for a basketball team called the ‘Magic’?” she wondered, as she moved closer to him.<br />
<br />
“Well, no, not really…” <br />
<br />
“Every time somebody talks about magic at school, your names come up…” she whispered to him.<br />
<br />
“It does?”<br />
<br />
She then placed her hands on the sides of Peter’s face as she slowly moved her lips closer to his, as she was about to kiss him on his lips.<br />
<br />
“Show me some of your awesome magic, Mister Peter the Wizard…” she whispered, as she closed her eyes and was about to kiss him on the lips, when Peter suddenly shot up and grew six inches taller, making her kiss him on the chest instead!<br />
<br />
“Whoa, you didn’t have to show me that fast!” she startled, when she realized that Peter had suddenly grown taller. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t do it! Trust me! It was a growth spurt! Honest….” Peter pleaded with her, but she was upset and walked over to pick up her bike.<br />
<br />
“Next time, shrink a little before I can kiss you, okay?” she said angrily, as she hopped on her bike and started to peddle.<br />
<br />
“Oh Carrie, wait… I’m sorry! I didn’t…” Peter shouted behind her, but it was too late. Carrie turned the corner and was gone from sight.<br />
<br />
Peter began to wonder what was going on, although he had a suspicion. And that was confirmed when he suddenly heard a loud roaring laughter coming from Ty’s upstairs room!<br />
<br />
“Allen! Stop it! STOP!! HHHAAAAAHAHAHHAAH” Ty laughed out loud, almost rolling off his bed. “I CAN’T HOLD IT ANYMORE!!!”<br />
<br />
Allen was laying flat on his back, laughing just as loud!<br />
<br />
“Poor Peter! God, that was funny!! HAAHAHAHHAAAA”<br />
<br />
“ALLEN, YOUR MAKING ME PEE IN MY PANTS FROM LAUGHING!!!! WHAAAAHAAAA!!!!” Ty shouted, falling off his bed, with his face as red as a tomato.<br />
<br />
“YOU TWO CLOWNS!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ty and Allen stopped when they noticed the three-legged Peter standing before them, with his arms folded in front of his chest.<br />
<br />
“I knew it! You two jokers have been messing with me for the past thirty minutes! You guys got NOTHING BETTER TO DO??!!” Peter shouted out loud.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, Peter! You gotta admit; you enjoyed it!” Ty responded carefully.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Peter! We were both bored and with Dustin being gone…” Allen explained, as he stood up. He realized that Peter wasn’t as angry as he first appeared, for he started to chuckle himself.<br />
<br />
“Besides, you look great with three legs, Peter! Keep the leg!” Ty said, challenging Peter to keep his third leg on his body. “It’ll help you when playing basketball!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, you two… Speaking of basketball… How about we see what’s going on at the park?” Peter suggested, as he grabbed his basketball from Ty’s bedroom floor. <br />
<br />
The three teens then walked out the door, heading towards the park. But Ty and Allen continued to whisper things to each other, whenever Peter wasn’t looking.<br />
<br />
“We can still have fun with him at the park!” Ty said quietly.<br />
<br />
“How about, we change him some more?” Allen replied.<br />
<br />
Ty just responded giving a thumbs-up sign, as the teens walked into the park.</p>
