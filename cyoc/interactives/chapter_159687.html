<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Trying to expand the universe, feel free to add your own stories and characters, or just add onto the lore!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam Page was a freshman at Garrington University in Pennsylvania, but lived off-campus in the nearby city. He was African-American and moved here from Michigan, though he really never felt like he belonged. After high school, he never talked to any of his friends. His family hadn’t bothered to check on him, and it was a miracle for him to get a girlfriend. No one had ever really shown any interest in him.<br />
<br />
<br />
When the were-outbreak reached his city, he was fortunate enough to find himself within a quarantine zone swiftly set up by the military. He met a girl who was nice enough, but when he asked her if she wanted to hook up after the event had blown over, she reacted with disgust at how he treated it as nothing.<br />
<br />
Not too long after, the alarms went off.<br />
<br />
<br />
The beasts had somehow joined together and surrounded the base, easily swarming the entrances. When they breached the walls, it was complete pandemonium. People were swarming up in giant groups trying to get on the last helicopters, only to be left behind to fend for themselves, Sam among them.<br />
<br />
<br />
The girl he had been flirting with was pounced on by what looked to be a snow leopard, and when he mounted her, Sam decided to leave her behind. There was no way he’d be able to free her from his grasp. Now, he was fleeing the fenced-compound, running down one of the streets branching off of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
All he wanted was someone to be with, let alone people around him. He began crying helplessly, both in frustration and fear of what was to come. He had no car. No other humans around him. Nowhere to go. But no, he was all alone. Again.<br />
<br />
<br />
He stopped at a street corner to prevent himself from hyperventilating. Looking behind him, he was lucky enough to have avoided any weres and began to calm down, only to hear a strange sound from his left.<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s when he saw a lioness on top of her victim just down the street. A young man, not too much older than Sam, was being forced into a French kiss, his screams and cries muffled by her tongue. Sam began to freak out again, moving in the opposite direction of the lioness while keeping his eyes on her and her now-transforming prey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam started running backwards before turning over his shoulder, only to run directly into a wall and sent flying onto his back. Rubbing his head, he looked up and his eyes went wide-open. To his horror, he hadn’t run into a wall. Standing in front of him was a massive humanoid female grizzly bear, bigger than any beast he had seen before. She was nearly eight feet tall and very muscular, though heavier when it came to weight. She had a rack of six breasts lining her front, still slightly jiggling around from the impact.<br />
<br />
<br />
As he recovered from being frozen in fear, he began crawling away on his back. The beast towered over him and slowly bent down and reached out for him. He cried out in fear as she wrapped her arms around the struggling boy and lifted him off the ground with ease, looking at him with a gentle smile. He struggled to breath as she pulled him into a literal bear hug, his face smushing up against her pudgy breast. Sam prepared himself for the worst as she slightly released her grasp of him, still keeping him confined in her arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
He was ready when she pulled him in for a kiss, making sure he kept moving his head and keeping his mouth shut. He ended up with her slobber across his face, but it was better than it in his mouth. When the bear-beast released her romantic gesture, she was disappointed that her companion wasn’t going to give up easily. Then, she got an idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam became concerned when he watched the bear’s expression shift from discontent to mischievousness as she released one of her arms from around him, her other firmly holding him in place. She glanced down at her breast with a devious smile, Sam gulping as she began squeezing her top right teat.<br />
<br />
<br />
A small squirt of breastmilk landed on Sam’s cheek, causing him to react in disgust. This distracted him long enough for her to pull him closer to her chest, which allowed her to use her free arm to push his face into her breast. After a bit of force, her nipple broke through his lips, and his lips were forced open wider with more pushing. Sam was horrified by his assailant’s ability to execute such a plan, but all thoughts her cut short as she squeezed his torso tight, restricting his airflow.<br />
<br />
<br />
He tried sucking in air, but instead began unintentionally sucking on her teat, filling his mouth with her breastmilk. Knowing he was going to suffocate otherwise, he was forced to swallow the thick liquid, the milk pouring down his throat. The taste wasn’t nearly as repulsive as he had imagined, but he was still in a panic mode from his current predicament.<br />
<br />
<br />
He was still being forced to suck on his assailant’s breast, and was only barely allowed to breath through his nose. However, he couldn’t help but notice how the bear held him. She was gentle with him, and looked at him with what looked to be genuine love. She didn’t care how he looked or acted, she just wanted to be with him because of nature, which is all he needed. He began to lower his guard as he continued drinking her milk, feeling the first of the changes overwhelm him.<br />
<br />
<br />
He soon realized that there was no way out of his situation and lowered his resistance. Besides, maybe it wasn’t so bad after all? This bear had shown him more love than anyone had before, and that’s all he wanted in life. He began willingly sucking on her breasts, taking in large gulps of her milk and causing her to pant. Sam closed his eyes as he felt a strange sensation on his face, failing to identify the fur growing around the sides of his face.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam’s abdomen began to change from the transformative breastmilk, bloating up and increasing his overall size. His face slightly pushed out, his tongue enlarged and his nose started to gain a leathery texture.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bear beast noticed Sam’s content and slowly pulled him from her chest, the  boy relaxed and panting from his breastfeeding. She decided to try and kiss him again, and to her delight, he reciprocated it. His tongue entered her lips first, and the two began to explore each other’s mouths. Sam could care less that his body was constantly gaining weight and mass, or that claws were bursting out of his fingernails. <br />
<br />
<br />
With her soon-to-be bear no longer resistant, the bear-beast released his arms, which allowed him to wrap them around her and pull her in closer. Sam had outgrown his clothing, his shirt and shorts tearing at the threads and snapping off entirely. His nude body was in the process of growing a thick layer of fur as his arms began to bulk up, as did his legs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam had become much more difficult to carry, and his mass continued to increase as his mate slowly set him down on his newly-clawed and lengthened feet. He continued to grow, nearing his new-girlfriend’s height and overall appearance. His ears had migrated up his head and his face had begun its final changes, and Sam grimaced as his jaws and nose pushed out all the way into a grizzly bear- beast muzzle. His body finished fattening up and the two mates embraced once again, passionately kissing.<br />
<br />
<br />
While Sam’s memories were still intact, though they gained more animalistic elements to them, such as the need to breed with the beautiful bear in front of him. The two broke their embrace and walked towards a nearby shop front, which they would soon convert into a den for their future cubs. <br />
<br />
<br />
———————————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
<br />
Nearly three years later, Sam and his mate still resided in that shopfront, the two bears raising three cubs together. The city was now overgrown and home to hundreds of beasts who had converted the buildings into dens and habitats. The overgrown streets provided plenty of food and resources for their survival, and not one human dared to enter the area.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, something was happening. Sam and his bear wife woke from their slumber with massive headaches, grabbing their skulls in pain. Then, they fully remembered who they were. They kept their new bodies, as well as the memories of the past three years, though they remembered who they were before.<br />
<br />
<br />
The same phenomenon was happening across the nation. Beasts regained their consciousness, and they soon realized how much the world had changed, and how much further it would change in the coming years.</p>
