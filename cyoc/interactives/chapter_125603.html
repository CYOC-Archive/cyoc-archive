<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Samantha was it? Ms. Tomlin said, back still turned to the both of you. “Working at a Zoo you must have quite a bit of experience with animals“- Ms. Tomlin looked over her shoulder at Sam-“and seeing them acting… naturally.” The sly smile that crossed Ms. Tomlin’s lips was somewhat unnerving.<br />
<br />
“Naturally?” Sam asked after a moment’s hesitation. “As in-“<br />
<br />
“I think you’ll be a fine candidate for the first transformation of this school year. Please, come up to the front of the class.”<br />
All eyes watched Sam stand up and follow Ms. Tomlin to the front of the class where the teacher handed Sam a glass with a white liquid. Ms Tomlin added, “When you’re ready drink the liquid. Don’t worry, it doesn’t taste bad.”<br />
<br />
Sam was blushing with so much attention on her. She looked at me as she took a deep breath and drank the liquid.<br />
“Very good.” Ms Tomlin said, “This will be a little uncomfortable. I would advise you to remove your clothing. Don’t worry, you’ll all see each other in your underwear soon enough.”<br />
<br />
A few dog whistles came from some in the class which were quickly cut off with a fearful glare from the teacher.<br />
<br />
Sam had been a good friend since elementary school. She was a gorgeous woman. Flowing brown hair that went just past the shoulders, large inviting blue eyes, curvous body, and well developed breasts. You had never thought of her in sexual terms but you could feel your pants growing tighter as she removed her shirt and pants; leaving her in nothing but a bra and underwear. Sam was blushing even harder now as you saw the chill in the air cause her nipples to become visible through her bra. She looked back at you for support, which you tried to offer with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Sam exclaimed as she looked down at her underwear which she stretched out so she could see underneath. “My hair’s turning white!” It wasn’t long until soft thick white fur spread from her underwear and progressed down her legs and up her chest. “It tickles!”<br />
<br />
You slid your hand into your pants to adjust your stiff penis. You looked around and saw that all the other guys were doing the same; some were even beginning to pump theirs stealthily. You looked back at Sam as she was bringing a hand up and started to pet her fur covered chest.<br />
<br />
“..ohhhhh…”<br />
<br />
That was a moan of pleasure for sure. You didn’t think your penis could get any bigger but it had.<br />
Sam closed her eyes as she continued to pet herself. White fur had covered her body now with no other physical alterations visible to her form. Her hair had also started to retract and turn white. As her hair finished retracting black spots became visible in the white fur. Sam was now a woman with an amazing snow leopard fur coat. She opened her eyes and the entire class held its breath. Her eyes were now golden-hue cat eyes. “Let me get these off”- she unhooked her bra and took off her underwear as she admired herself. Nudity didn’t seem to bother her anymore, though the fur did cover everything. She looked up at Ms. Tomlin after a few moments and inquired, “Am I done?”<br />
<br />
Ms. Tomlin shook her head, “No. You will be a full snow leopard. This is just a momentary repre-“<br />
<br />
“AHHHHH!!” Sam screamed as she straightened herself, arching her back and throwing her head back. She held that position for a few seconds before she relaxed again and asked with concern, “What was that?”<br />
<br />
“This will be a little painful, just keep breathing.”<br />
<br />
“Wait whaHHHH!!” Sam screamed again as she collapsed onto the floor.<br />
<br />
You stood but prevented from advancing as Ms. Tomlin held up a hand and smiled confidently. “She’s not in too much pain, just discomfort and surprise.”<br />
<br />
Sam moaned again in pleasure before letting out another scream. She was writhing on the ground in a fetal position while also rubbing herself intimately. You could see small changes starting now. Her breasts were not nearly as large as they had been and you could see 6 dots along her stomach. Sam screamed again, much more gutturally, as a sickening POP came from her hips as they noticeably contracted causing her shorter back legs to no longer allow a bipedal stance. She looked up at you with her cat eyes and you could see concern in her eyes. You kept your eyes on her as you noticed her ears had disappeared. Slowly new rounded ears popped out on top of her head as her shoulders gave another sickening crunch causing most laterally mobility to be lost form her slandering arms. She writhed some more as pained cat cries escaped her as a tail push out of her back. She moved her head back as you watched her mouth push out and her nose recede into a muzzle.<br />
<br />
You look down and notice that her hands and feet had become large paws. Sam opened her mouth and gave a deafening roar as she threw her head back. Her chest barrels downward in a final bit of transformation at which point all her strength gave out and she went limp on the ground.<br />
<br />
The entire class was still staring in awe at the snow leopard which just minute before was a beautiful young woman.</p>
