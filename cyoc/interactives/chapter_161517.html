<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is about to happen.&quot; Mitch said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to.&quot; Adomm retorted, &quot;It&#39;s happening anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
The spirit&#39;s hand went into Tiffany&#39;s back, and a second spool was drawn out, glowing just as vibrantly as Mitch&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll start with you, female.&quot; she smiled, &quot;You seem the more eager.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked Mitch and smiled gleefully. &quot;I&#39;m gonna be an animal!  A braying jenny ass! My life has been building up to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can any of us have predicted something like this?&quot; Mitch asked, &quot; This is the craziest- oh! Woah, your feet!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was slow, but easily noticable. Her toes curled in and her feet expanded out, forming large black solid keratin hooves. Then, gray fur began to crawl up her legs, vanishing under her skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; She yelped. Clops filled the barn as she stumbled around on her unfamilar legs. She was about to fall when Mitch caught her.  She looked down and made a big silly grin as she saw her gray furred ankles inches away from the grown.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to them.&quot; Mitch said confidently, perfectly balanced on his own.<br />
<br />
Adomm said nothing. She was too focused on threading the strings through her hands, weaving and flowing them around. Her motions were hypnotic and even kind of poetic.<br />
<br />
The fur reached up to Tiffany&#39;s hindquarters, and she already started feeling the return of an old friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to rip them wide open this time!&quot; Her butt was on fire! She felt like ants were crawling over it, and there was a mad hot tingling right at the top of her crack, then the feeling of pops and snaps from it. She felt her tail shoot into her panties and shred through them, then ram into her skirt<br />
<br />
Adomm&#39;s blade trick to rip the skirt. The tail stretched and expanded out, moving from side to side hitting her own butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
The gray fur never stopped. It continued to climb up her chest. Mitch watched in shock and awe. <br />
<br />
Adomm then reached forward and slid her fingers down Tiffany&#39;s skirt. With a burst of threads, her skirt and her panties unravelled as individual threads and fell away into the hay covered floor, revealing the girl&#39;s naked lower body.<br />
<br />
The white and black spirit did the same to her shirt, revealing her chest covered with silky gray fur, reaching to her elbows and neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mitch I...I feel so..so warm...&quot;  She ran her hands up and down her furry belly, giggling. The fur on her belly was a light gray while the fur around her sides was pitch gray. She reached back and grabbed her tail, pulling it around to run her fingers through the black silky tassel.<br />
<br />
She ran her fingers up and down the fur until she could no longer feel it, and before she knew it, she could no longer even feel her fingers. Her palms had blown up like balloons, sucking her digits slowly in and melting them into a large fluid glob attacked to fur-coated stubs.<br />
<br />
Then they shaped, they hardened, and they were stiff and still; alike to her feet, yet just a little different.<br />
<br />
She stared at them. &quot;Look at me, Mitch...I don&#39;t have hands anymore.&quot; She clopped around in the barn, tail twitching back and forth rapidly. &quot;Oh I feel so...so good! I feel like such an animal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her nose bloated forth and formed a long snout. &quot;My whole life has been leeee-heee-heeee-hawwwwwwwwwwww!&quot; Tiffany suddenly brayed.<br />
<br />
And finally, almost poetically ending it all; the parts that started it all. Her ears folded in and then flowed out on either side like a party blower.<br />
<br />
Mitch had no words. It was the most craziest thing he had ever seen. Never, in his wildest nightmares, in his weirdest dreams, had he ever imagined such a phenominal sight.<br />
<br />
Tiffany had a massive grin, one that scrunched up her bulblous muzzle and showed off large buck teeth.  &quot;Me so happy!&quot; She said, her voice was oddly thick, as if forming words was hard.  &quot;This me. More me.&quot; She put a hoof on her chest. &quot;Me donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
One final touch. A slight stretch and a curvature to the spine. With a great pull of her strings, Adomm brought the Jenny down to all fours, never to stand upright again.<br />
<br />
Tiffany stood there on four hooves putting her head between her forelegs, shaking it occasionally. Suddenly she looked up. &quot;HEEEE-HAWWWWW!&quot; She let out a very loud, very real bray. The little gray donkey kicked her legs a couple of times.<br />
<br />
With one final swirl of her finger, Adomm tossed the strings and they flew right into Tiffany&#39;s body, vanishing from sight.<br />
<br />
Then, she turned to Mitch, who stood there. He couldn&#39;t move. <br />
<br />
Tiffany was now braying continuously, bucking her hind legs around clearly just for the joy of bucking. The little donkey went outside so she could have more space to buck.<br />
<br />
Mitch stood. He was ready. He was willing. He was. ... wasn&#39;t he? Was he... was he really OK with this? Come on spirit, he thought, start it already! Don&#39;t let me second-guess.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your last chance to run.&quot; Adomm advised him, &quot;I cannot move nearly as fast as you can run, so I wouldn&#39;t bother chasing.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he wanted to. He so wanted to. This was Tiffany&#39;s dream, not his. Did she really even need him? They had only known each other for two days, after all. This was absurd.<br />
<br />
He should run. He should have run.... but he couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; he stammered.<br />
<br />
She looked up at him. She was so small, just twice the size of his head. Yet, she was so scary. So intimidating. Even her stare of Indifference was one of confidence. It was like she was reading his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;...be...before you do this...&quot; Mitch choked, his eyes tearing up, &quot;An- answer me one thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adomm shrugged and looked to her threads. Mitch&#39;s threads. She began to run her fingers through them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am...&quot; Mitch stuttered, &quot;I... did- d-did I.... did I make the right choice? Is this... the right thing to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was so fucused on the thread, not reacting to Mitch at all, that he feared he would never get an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no right or wrong choice.&quot; she said statically, &quot;You are bred, conditioned, and influenced to make these calls. There is no choice to make because it is already predetermined by many different factors what your action will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at Mitch with her diamond-shaped eyes, not out of concern, but more out of discipline.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is why I will never understand humans.&quot; she said, &quot;They are so focused and driven by past events. All it is is reference material. Out of date. A single millisecond can change a world. And despite that, rarely do they truly focus on the &#39;now&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have run. You are not equiped for the life you are about to live. It is not ideal for you, having been conditioned all your life as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you couldn&#39;t because you were bound by the past. You felt committed because of a past promise. A past event.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stuck her fingers into the thread, and Mitch felt a lurching in his gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Word of advice.&quot; she said, as though granting him a million gold coins, &quot;Forget your past. It will be obsolete now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt his legs shifting. In a moment, he would no longer be able to stand upright. He would no longer be able to even barely pass off as human, even if he did cut the tail off. He couldn&#39;t bear to think about it, so he did what the spirit told him to. He willed himself to let himself forget. He let himself forget about his friends back at home. They were probably out partying now, wondering where he was. No more. The brown fur climbed up his arms as he fell over, catching himself on his hands in the pile of hay. He forgot about his school, and his education. All the things he learned and studied, from home economics, to math, to English... none of that mattered anymore. His hands stung under his weight, but he didn&#39;t have to bare it for long. His fingers receded and he was left with two flat hardened hooves, pushing up against the hard dirt floor. He forgot his future. Taking over the bakery, perhaps opening his own. All those people he would have satisfied and fed. All the connections he would have made. All the girls he would have met and got along with.<br />
<br />
His neck stretched, and dark fur flowed out from up his spine into a long bushy mane, sticking up and out from the top of his forehead.<br />
He forgot about his dad. His dad, whom, after his mother had passed, he was all his dad had left. He meant well, working him so hard. His dad didn&#39;t want him to suffer. He wanted a son capable of taking care of him until his end of days. And now he was alone. No more.<br />
His snout lengthened out and his eyes, still tearing up, seperated to either side of his face. As the fur climbed his face, his ears climbed the sides of his head, stretching up like insect antennae.<br />
He forgot about it all. It no longer mattered. This was his future now. A future he had committed to.<br />
<br />
And, if it was going to be the case...... why not at least enjoy it?<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWW!&quot; he screamed, making the barn walls rattle, &quot;HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
And it was done.<br />
<br />
He could no longer thank the spirit through words. He felt that part of him was gone. But he still wanted to at least give her a nod. To thank her for all of this. This experience.<br />
<br />
But Adomm was nowhere to be found. Her work finished, she disappeared. No goodbye, no salute, not even a wave. The glowing green pods were gone, and the barn was dark and still once more. No evidence remained that she was even there.<br />
<br />
Tiffany was grazing in the field, filling herself with as much grass as she could take.  She ate greedily and quickly, as if trying to make up for all of the meals she&#39;d had that had not been grass. She had 12 years as a human, in donkey years she was 2 year old. She had a lot of time to satisfy herself!<br />
<br />
Mitch stumbled out of the barn, unsure of how to walk on four legs. He figured out two hooves; eventually he&#39;ll learn to use four. How Tiffany nailed it immediately would remain a mystery to him.<br />
<br />
It was very clear Tiffany was far more asinine than him.  She indulged every urge of her new body no matter how basic was. It was like the donkey had always been there, deep down. Now it was finally free.<br />
<br />
He pushed his way out of the barn and into the clear night air. His companion for life was already running about free.<br />
<br />
Adomm was right. No more thoughts. No more attachments to the past. From now on, he was going to live in the now. He walked. Then trotted. Then ran through the recently trimmed hayfields to join Tiffany as she whipped her black mane around and wagged her tail proudly.<br />
<br />
And he joined her in a chorus of sounds and brays, whisked away by the dark sky into a hint of subtle outlines.</p>
