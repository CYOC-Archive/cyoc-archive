<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oblivious to the centaur&#39;s true goals, Derrick allowed himself to be led by the horselike servant.  Two other of the creatures joined them, whickering and snorting excitedly.  Hard, three-fingered hands slid over his skin with no regard for personal space or propriety, groping and probing private areas as well as his nose, mouth, and ears.  At first it was the thought of three million dollars that kept Derrick cooperating, but he found himself returning the exploration.  It was like having three huge, curious dogs focused on him.<br />
<br />
He was taken to a stall that had a large pile of manure in the back.  One of the servants led him over, then stooped to scoop up the pile with its hands.  It carried the mess out and dumped it in a manure pile out back of the building.  They then went to another soiled stall, only this time the servants watched him.  He blinked and stared - did they expect him to...?  Three million dollars.  Three million dollars.  Sighing, he leaned over and wrinkled his nose in disgust as he slid his hands under the still warm shit, trying to keep straw between fingers and manure.  This worked the first time, but five stalls later his hands were dark with streaks of centaur crap.  But by that time he found he really didn&#39;t mind.  Only the original servant was still with him by that time, the others gone on to groom centaurs or beasts.  It turned out that all of the equine creatures of the Spa lived here - centaurs, pegasus, and horses, donkeys and mules.  No wonder they needed help.<br />
<br />
After muck duty, he was given the task of moving hay bales.   This time the servant worked with him, moving twice as many bales as Derrick to start.  The boy&#39;s muscles burned, but the bales seemed to get lighter as he worked, until he was almost keeping up with the larger and stronger servant. Work never seemed to end - the manure pile had to be moved out to a large spreader, water buckets filled, feed bags moved, grooming, and then back to mucking.  It was halfway into the second round of cleaning stalls that Derrick realized his hands had changed. The fingers were flatter and longer, and while not joined, they moved more like two digits then four.  That got him curious.  A look down made him smile - his gentials were obviously larger and darker, and his body was more muscular.  This was just for a few days - and the servant&#39;s hands did work better for the job.<br />
<br />
The stalls were filling up as animals and centaurs came in for the night.  Eventually, there was no more work to do.  Derrick was feeling tired, but oddly satisfied with his efforts.  Good thing his parents weren&#39;t seeing him work this hard - then again, his allowance wasn&#39;t three million dollars!  He followed the servants to a communal rest area where they slurped water and ate grain from large troughs.  His teacher, or at least the one he thought had started him off, held up a handful of the feed to Derrick&#39;s mouth.  It smelled good, and he tried a few.  The grain was a little bland, but if he chewed it up enough it was digestible.  Probably one of the ways they tried to prevent having to pay the reward.  Derrick wasn&#39;t giving up that easy.  He ate more of the grain, and found that it really was pretty good.  Without thinking about it, he was soon shoveling in the feed like the servants, and slurping up the water scummed with saliva and bits of uneaten grain.  <br />
<br />
Fatigue hit hard after that.  The servants were laying down on the straw bedding in small groups.  His teacher guided him over to where another nearly identical male welcomed him into their cuddle.  Sandwiched between the two servants, Derick was surprised to find his genitals pressed against his teacher&#39;s crotch, with his face almost level with the beast&#39;s muzzle.  He had gotten taller!  That thought pleased him, though it was short-lived as a growing erection met that of his teacher, and the servant behind him pressed against his anus.  <br />
<br />
It was obvious from the sounds starting up around him that this was normal behavior for the servants.  But even if he had gotten bigger, was he really up to accommodating...  Derrick gasped as the question as answered for him.  Positions changed several times over the evening, and by the time he drifted off into thoroughly sated and content slumber, Derrick had no questions or reservations about servant copulation.</p>
