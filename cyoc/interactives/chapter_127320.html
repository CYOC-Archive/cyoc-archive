<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A nice summer day in town had turned bad, as the clouds burst. Now it was raining cats and dogs outside. People tried to flee to their homes during the rain, but two unfortunate individuals were too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler, don&#39;t go any further, take shelter at my house!&quot; Misha shouted towards her friend. Tyler hesitated for a moment, looking up into the sky. It was pretty spontaneous from Misha, she&#39;d never invited him before. In this weather however, he didn&#39;t want to walk, or run another mile to his own house. He shrugged and followed her.<br />
<br />
The two were covered by the roof sticking out from her house, as Misha searched for the right key in the collection. Tyler was still panting, out of breath from running. &quot;There it is.&quot; Said Misha, delighted. The door unlocked and she opened it. &quot;Come on in, this is your first time in here right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler looked around him once he had entered. It was like she and her friends said, spacious indeed! &quot;Mom?&quot; Misha was calling for her mother, but no one answered her. &quot;They must be away then...&quot;<br />
<br />
Misha put her shoes outside and started walking. Looking behind her, Tyler was still standing on the welcoming mat. He was soaked completely, Misha still had a raincoat. &quot;Ty, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; Tyler shrugged, Misha had an idea. &quot;Look Tyler, I don&#39;t have an older brother at home, and my dad is working abroad still, so I can&#39;t hand you any boy&#39;s clothes. But I can&#39;t let you walk around in such wet clothes, so put off your shoes and socks and then go upstairs. The door closest to you as you enter the hallway is the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler looked at her. &quot;You want me to take a shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
Misha answered. &quot;For my part you take a bath for half an hour, I&#39;ll fetch you some of my clothes, in hope they&#39;ll fit. If you throw your wet clothes outside, I&#39;ll get them washed.&quot; Tyler groaned. Misha reacted a bit offended. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Ty, jeez. I&#39;ll pick out the most masculine clothes I have,&quot; She then winked, &quot;besides, I don&#39;t have any dresses or miniskirts I can prank you with.&quot; Tyler grinned at that joke, but still stayed put.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; Said Misha, shoving him towards the stairs, &quot;Really, you don&#39;t want to catch a cold. I had a raincoat on, so I&#39;m still pretty dry.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Fine then. Take a shower it is. Tyler saw the temperature of the water was to his liking, all he had to do was turn on the shower. He waited for a moment, and as the water warmed up, he stepped into the stream and the steam. He&#39;d thrown his clothes on the hallway floor, and locked the bathroom door behind him, so he could shower in peace.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Tyler dried himself off with a spare towel set aside for him by Misha. He looked around, not finding any clothes. He hit himself on his forehead. Stupid of him, locking the door. He fastened the towel around his waist, and knocked on the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Misha? Are you out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
No reaction. She must be downstairs then. He unlocked the door, and opened it.<br />
<br />
Right beside the exit stood a small stool, with a bunch of clothes on top of it. His mobile phone and own keys were lying on this pile as well. He brought them into the bathroom, and inspected them.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s see. A vest, perhaps a bit too short for him. Misha used to wear those during gym practice, or with sports events, organised by school. He smelled it, noticing it was washed and clean.<br />
<br />
Next were the pants. Well, they were not pants, just leggings, also used for exercise probably. Jogging pants, likely. These were too short for him as well, obviously. Tyler was about 15 centimeters taller than Misha. But still, he preferred to have clothes on when someone was in his presence.<br />
<br />
..., was this a joke? &quot;Misha! What is this about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tyler heard her shouting from downstairs. &quot;What are those panties for?&quot; He shouted through the door, a bit annoyed, &quot;I ain&#39;t a woman, you know!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had nothing else! As I said, I only live here with my mom, daddy works abroad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least give me back my shorts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t, they&#39;re in the washing machine already, together with the rest of your clothes. Either wait for an hour, or put this clothes on, like a &#39;man&#39;!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tyler heard her emphasize the &#39;man&#39;-word in that sentence, and got annoyed by that. But there wasn&#39;t really anything to do against this. In an hour, he would have his clothes back again anyways.<br />
<br />
Tyler once again shrugged, and didn&#39;t waste time. He heard Misha walk out of the stairway again, towards the living room downstairs. &quot;Let&#39;s just get on with it.&quot; He muttered to himself, he put on Misha&#39;s panties.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Why would he be getting such a weird tingle by it? He stood still for a bit.<br />
<br />
He was blushing. Almost entirely naked, wearing a girl&#39;s panties, what a pervert he must be looking like right now. Was he getting an erection? It felt like it. Well, he was aroused, that&#39;s what he felt. There was no change, no discomfort.<br />
<br />
Tyler bit his lip, then moved on, wanting to distract himself from such thought. He put on the leggings with a swift movement. He then grabbed the shirt, and looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Was he seeing things? His posture had gotten wider? Something was going on with his hips. These leggings were hugging his legs completely, hips and ass included. But still, these legs didn&#39;t look like they belonged to Tyler himself. His hips looked like they had become wider, and his legs also hugged this piece of clothing perfectly. It was almost sexy.<br />
<br />
Tyler made some poses, leaning his hips outward, or sticking out his butt behind him. <br />
<br />
They definitely didn&#39;t look like his legs. What was going on?<br />
<br />
Once again, Tyler shook it off. It was probably a hallucination, or just a weird dream. He put on the vest, not unzipping the zipper, but just by sticking his head and arms through the holes. He picked up his phone and keys, then left the bathroom, and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
It still felt odd. He was used to pretty much running down the stairs, but right now, it was as if his butt was bouncing up and down in these black leggings. It was then that he entered the living room, and saw Misha chilling on the bench, playing on her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ty... erh... there&#39;s some drinks on the table behind you.&quot; She looked at him weird too, as she said that. Tyler just wanted to bring some peace to his mind. He picked up a glass of juice and carefully walked towards where Misha was sitting. He then sat down on a chair.<br />
<br />
An odd silence fell between them, with Misha occasionally looking at Tyler, as if something was wrong about him.<br />
<br />
Tyler let out a breath. &quot;So...&quot; As he wanted to start a conversation, he put a hand in front of is mouth, his eyes widening in shock. That wasn&#39;t his voice. <br />
<br />
Now Misha was in full attention as well. That didn&#39;t sound like him at all. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Exclaimed Misha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; She asked, fiercely. <br />
<br />
Tyler didn&#39;t exactly know how to answer, but did so with another question. &quot;What&#39;s with these clothes, Misha?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at him from bottom to top. The person in front of her looked like a female version of Tyler. Sitting there - Tyler unintentionally had crossed his legs for some reason - was someone with female legs, and almost a female figure. The only things this person in front of her lacked was two visible breasts, but these were probably hidden underneath the vest. Only the face still had most of Tyler&#39;s features, only much more feminine somehow. His hair was still pretty much short.<br />
<br />
Misha could barely believe it, but asked to be sure. &quot;You&#39;re still Tyler right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put off these clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious, get naked, this shouldn&#39;t be you anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler first undid himself from the vest, going topless. The features had gotten very feminine, him almost having an hourglass figure. It didn&#39;t look like he had actual breasts, but from Misha&#39;s view, the areola&#39;s had grown. She approached Tyler, touching and carefully massaging one of them.<br />
<br />
Tyler couldn&#39;t believe the sensations he felt, he felt his nipple stiffen. His friend&#39;s breath stocked at the sight of this. Tyler felt himself get erect. Well, erect? No, not that. Just aroused, it was as if he felt the blood rushing to another organ, he&#39;d never felt before.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck.&quot; He said, his breath lost to the odd pleasure. Tyler took action, pulling down the leggings he was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop there.&quot; Misha said, and she started examining his legs.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s legs were shorter than before, but it wasn&#39;t much of a difference. All hair was shaved off somehow, even though he&#39;d never shaved his legs before. Besides that, they were much wider than usual, his hips were the points of his body which stuck out the most right now. It used to be his shoulders. His feet had also changed shape, albeit not drastically, having gotten smaller.<br />
<br />
Misha bent down, bringing her hands to both sides of Tyler&#39;s left leg, and she brought them upwards, slowly. He was feeling tense, but got more tense as the hands brought their way to his inner thigh. His heartbeat increased by a little bit. Then Misha waved her hand over his ass, and he felt how much more of a curve that part of his lower body had. &quot;Definitely a woman&#39;s.&quot; She whispered under her breath. Tyler confirmed that thought, not knowing how else to react.<br />
<br />
Misha cupped her hand, and looked at Tyler. &quot;Can I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-hm!&quot; Tyler answered, in a high pitch. He didn&#39;t dare inspecting his genitals himself, he&#39;d already confirmed that he lost his penis in the process.<br />
<br />
Misha brought her hand to his groin, and tried to feel through the fabric of the panties he was wearing. She pulled back her hand once she&#39;d felt enough.<br />
<br />
Misha let out a quick breath, trying to break through the long period of silence and surprise. &quot;How did this happen Tyler? You&#39;ve become a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler knew already. &quot;It has to do with your clothes.&quot; That must be it. Every time he put on a piece of clothing which she lend out to him, his body changed to fit it perfectly. As these were girl&#39;s clothes, he himself had turned into a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;So weird.&quot; The two said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Misha said gleefully, as her eyes lit up, &quot;I&#39;ve something I want you to try out.&quot;<br />
<br />
She ran upstairs, towards her own room probably. Tyler followed her until the stairway. &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bra!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Abra?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, a BRA!&quot; Misha shouted back, louder this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Misha entered Tyler&#39;s field of vision again, on top of the staircase. She was holding a sports bra in her hands, showing it to him.<br />
<br />
Misha walked down the stairs. &quot;But why?&quot; Asked Tyler.<br />
<br />
&quot;To do this. Lift your arms.&quot; Tyler obeyed, and Misha slid the bra down his arms, past his head, onto his chest.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked at the whole process, and saw how the bra already had some sort of shape or mold in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; Misha gasped, looking at her friend from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you honestly think they&#39;re real? Misha, the bra already was that shape when put it on me.&quot; His friend proved him wrong, by grabbing and violently squishing the two mounds on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch! Wait...&quot; Tyler looked down again. His now slender hands touched the fabric, but he could feel the space in between his chest and his bra was filled by two lumps. Even the nipples were sticking out again, through the fabric, that was.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be fair Ty, you are a girl right now...&quot; Misha told him in amusement and admiration.<br />
<br />
Tyler cringed. &quot;Yeah whatever, let me put them off, I want to be a guy again. And give me my own clothes back.&quot;</p>
