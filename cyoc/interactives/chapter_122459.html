<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold Jenkins and his fiance Virginia McCoy watched as the quartet of raccoon teenagers, all dressed like cowboys, approached the punch bowl on the food table they were standing by.<br />
The adults were concerned that Alice Decrux, a were-raccoon that they had been having troubles with, had spiked the punch with the powerful aphrodisiac she called &quot;Love Potion #9&quot;. This drug, for lack of a better term, seriously ramped up the sex drive of both weres and normal human beings alike.<br />
This wasn&#39;t really an issue for were couples, or even for normal couples. Just simply find a quiet spot with your partner and have at it until the urge and the chemical concoction wore off.<br />
But if there was an unplanned sexual encounter between a were and a normal, which was what Alice was hoping for between Harold&#39;s daughter Melissa and whoever as part of her twisted scheme of revenge against Harold for spurning Alice in favor of Virginia, then there would soon be a new addition to the were population of Moon Lake, whether or not the former normal had planned on ever becoming a were, regardless of what their new fursona was.<br />
Alice&#39;s ultimate hope was that Melissa Jenkins became a were-raccoon as a constant but unwanted reminder of Decrux. Melissa was currently leaning toward eventually becoming a werecow to be with her werebull boyfriend Trevor Tyson when their relationship had progressed enough to &quot;take the next step&quot;.<br />
But regardless of when and what Melissa became, Harold Jenkins was determined that it would be her decision alone, and no one was going to influence or interfere with his daughter&#39;s right to choose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you boys?&quot; asked weretigress Virginia McCoy, who was on chaperone duty at the annual Moon Lake Halloween dance that night.<br />
&quot;Yeah. We&#39;re thirsty and would like some punch,&quot; said one of the were-raccoon cowboys, while eyeing the punch bowl.<br />
The quartet&#39;s plan was to secretly fill the water pistols of their costumes with punch and get Melissa Jenkins to &quot;drink&quot; some when they &quot;accidentally&quot; squirted her.<br />
None of the four boys knew about Alice Decrux&#39;s plan or why she wanted them to make sure Melissa had some punch. The only thing on the horny teenagers&#39; collective minds was the fact that Decrux had promised a serious bout of hot sex with the successful teenager.<br />
Then again, Decrux didn&#39;t know that the four boys had decided to team up instead of making it a competition so that they ALL could fuck the hot older were-raccoon lady when they went to collect their &quot;prize&quot;.<br />
&quot;Afraid I can&#39;t serve you any of that bowl. We&#39;re waiting on some fresh punch to arrive. Would you like some bottled water or some soda in the meantime?&quot; asked Virginia.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with the punch?&quot; asked another were-raccoon, moving closer to the bowl. He was too busy trying to smell the punch—in case there truly was something wrong with it—to notice Harold Jenkins starting to bear his weretiger teeth in anger.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been spiked,&quot; admitted McCoy.<br />
&quot;What do you mean &#39;spiked&#39;? Somebody put nails in it?&quot; asked another raccoon cowboy.<br />
&quot;No boys. That means somebody, and we happen to know who, put something in the punch bowl to make people sick,&quot; said Harold Jenkins, moving a step closer to the one closest to the punch bowl.<br />
He was doing his best to control his anger, but there was no denying that the weretiger before them wasn&#39;t a happy man.<br />
&quot;Err... I don&#39;t smell anything,&quot; commented the were-raccoon closest to the punch bowl. &quot;Just how sick would someone get if they drank it?&quot;<br />
&quot;VERY sick,&quot; replied Harold Jenkins in a low growl, bearing all his teeth for the quartet to see.<br />
<br />
The four were-raccoons looked at each other, wondering what to do next, when a voice asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on over here?&quot;<br />
Everyone turned to look and saw werevixen/high school student Migumi Tachibana, the head organizer of the dance, approaching.<br />
Virginia bowed slightly, out of respect for the Tachibana name, before answering, &quot;Somebody spiked the punch and we&#39;re waiting for a fresh bowl.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Again?&quot; said Migumi in return. &quot;Happens at least once every dance. I&#39;ll just dump this, wash out the bowl, and then make some fresh. Back as soon as I can,&quot; she promised, before grabbing the punch bowl and walking away with it.<br />
Both weretigers were visibly relieved at this new development, but the wereraccoons grew concerned. Even if they had been successful, would they have been guilty of poisoning someone? Would that land them in jail? How would they ever collect on Decrux&#39;s promise of hot sex then?<br />
Just as they turned to leave to figure out what to do now, Harold Jenkins said in a polite voice, &quot;Oh boys...&quot;<br />
This made the were-raccoons stop and turn back around to face the weretigers. &quot;Yes, sir?&quot; their self elected leader said.<br />
&quot;If you see her before the police do, tell Alice Decrux that we&#39;re on to her schemes, and the last thing she ever wants to do is cross our paths again,&quot; said Harold, as he put an arm affectionately around Virginia&#39;s waist.<br />
&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; promised all four were-raccoons, as they turned and left the high school gym where the dance was being held as fast as they could.<br />
<br />
OUTSIDE, BACK IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT...<br />
&quot;Okay. What do we do now?&quot; one were-raccoon asked the others.<br />
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; replied another. &quot;I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re not going to jail!&quot;<br />
A comment to which the other three rapidly agreed.<br />
&quot;Say. If Decrux goes to jail, that means she can&#39;t reward us,&quot; realized another.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said the second since, being teenage boys as well as teenage weres, they were horny and had yet to be satisfied sexually that night.<br />
&quot;Listen. What if we go to Decrux and collect our reward before the police arrest her?&quot; asked their leader.<br />
&quot;How can we do that? We never did what she asked us to do,&quot; the third were-raccoon pointed out.<br />
&quot;But she doesn&#39;t need to know that. We can always say we squirted that girl with the punch in our water pistols like we planned. Then, if Decrux asks any questions, say we didn&#39;t stick around to see what happened next because we wanted to have fun with her,&quot; explained the first.<br />
&quot;I like that. For an older were, Alice Decrux is one sexy MILF*,&quot; replied the fourth boy.<br />
&quot;Okay. The night&#39;s still young and so are we. Let&#39;s go find her and collect our prize before the police arrest Decrux,&quot; said their leader, before the four were-raccoons went off into the night, away from the high school.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Megumi Tachibana took the bowl of tainted punch to the kitchen of the school cafeteria, since the staff of the Halloween party had access to that area.<br />
There, she saw another empty punch bowl and ladle sitting on one of the metal food preparation tables.<br />
Checking the refrigerators, she found the rest of the premade punch in an over sized container.<br />
Pouring the contents into the new bowl, Migumi added some ice and stirred.<br />
Then, she happened to look up and saw what time it was.<br />
<i>Dang! There&#39;s too much to do as it is! I&#39;ve got to get back to the party!</i> she realized, while grabbing the new bowl of punch. <i>I&#39;ll have to come back and dump out the spiked stuff later,</i> thought Megumi, walking back to the dance while leaving the original punch bowl out on the table where she left it.<br />
<br />
