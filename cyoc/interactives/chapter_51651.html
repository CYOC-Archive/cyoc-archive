<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Cassie Plunkett,&quot; Angela said holding out her hand to you.<br />
<br />
You decided that you might as well and go meet Cassie so you took Angela's hand and let her lead you inside. You looked back over your shoulder and saw that Nick looked like he was beating himself up. &quot;I forgive you Nick,&quot; you called back. &quot;Don't beat yourself up.&quot; You hoped he would be alright.<br />
<br />
You were glad that Angela was leading you as it looked like you could get lost in here. You were led to the third floor and a door. Angela opened it and said, &quot;Cassie. I have a roommate for you. She was just transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I watched it,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;I'm Cassandra May Plunkett and this is Alexia. What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya May Turner,&quot; you said smiling. You were extremely happy to give someone your new name since your dream had come true.<br />
<br />
Cassie smiled back and said, &quot;It's nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is nice to meet you,&quot; Alexia said.<br />
<br />
You were surprised that the doll Cassie was holding talked. You recovered quickly and said, &quot;Nice to meet you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well girls it's time for dinner,&quot; Angela said. &quot;Come along and wash up. You can bring Alexia Cassie.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Cassie slid off the window seat. You would need to learn how to do that in a dress as well as she did. Once she had joined you and Angela you were led to a washroom. Cassie set Alexia on the counter and went into one of the stalls. You realize that you need to pee so you go into one of the other stalls. Once you closed the stall door you realized that you couldn't whip your dick out to pee anymore seeing as you don't have it anymore. Thinking for a moment you realize that you'd have to sit down to pee. Now you just had to figure out how to do it. You couldn't drop your pants like you could before. Now you were wearing a dress. Then you smacked yourself in the forehead realizing that you were wearing a dress. After dropping your panties it should be a simple matter to hike the skirt part up and sit on the toilet. Sitting down on the toilet you let the stream of pee go. It was strange going as a girl. Instead of the splashing sound you were used to it was more of a tinkle sound. Also it was strange not having to direct it like you had to before. You finished and got off the toilet not bothering to wipe. You pulled your panties back up and flushed the toilet.<br />
<br />
You went to one of the sinks and washed your hands. As you did you took a look at yourself. You looked cute with your black hair in small curls down to your shoulders. Your eyes had turned hazel in color. Pushing your hair aside you saw that you were wearing earrings and you were sure your ears were pierced. Smiling you dried your hands and followed Angela down to dinner.<br />
<br />
Dinner consisted of spaghetti, bread stick, salad, fresh fruit, and milk. You ate as much as you could but it was a bit much though you did at least eat half of everything you were served. After dinner Angela took you and Cassie to a room where you could get some clothes. She had both of you take your clothes off so she could measure you to get the right size clothes. You had fun picking out the dresses you wanted. That's all you would have picked out but Angela insisted that you have a more varied wardrobe. After that you were led back to your room and both you and Cassie got ready for bed.<br />
<br />
Once you two were ready you sat on your beds and talked. &quot;How long have you been here Cassie?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got here today,&quot; Cassie said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sorry,&quot; you said thinking that you had hit an open wound. Trying to apologize you said, &quot;I didn't mean to... I mean it still must hurt... but you seem happy enough... I remember when my parents passed... it was a couple of years ago... oh I'm rambling.&quot;<br />
<br />
To your surprise Cassie laughed and said, &quot;My parents are still alive. At least who used to be my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you asked very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I was transformed today,&quot; Cassie said smiling. &quot;In fact it was Alexia here who transformed me and I transformed her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; you asked. Cassie told you how she came to be transformed. After she finished you asked, &quot;So you didn't want to be a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have been curious about what it would be like to be a girl,&quot; Cassie admitted. &quot;I didn't think I'd have the opportunity to actually find out. Today was the first day I even heard about the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But everyone knows about the game,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe those who have lived in Glendale for awhile,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;I haven't been living here long. In fact it's only been four months since I moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said nodding. &quot;I'm sorry you had to find out about it like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Cassie said waving it off. &quot;What about you? Did you want to be a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't expect to be ten,&quot; you said smiling. &quot;Though I'm not complaining. I've always wanted to be a girl and now I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're lucky,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;You get sort of what you wanted. Do you have any abilities?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; you said. &quot;I wasn't really good at anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you misunderstood me,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;I meant abilities like with me. I have two forms. This one and a glass one. In my glass form I can go into any mirror or reflective surface into the mirror world and travel between mirrors in three steps.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were stunned for a moment then you said, &quot;Cool. Can you show me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Cassie said.<br />
<br />
Her pajamas started to fade away as she turned to glass. You had expected her to be nude when she was glass but it looked like she was wearing a bikini though that was glass too. It looked like she was poured into a mold when she was molten glass. &quot;That is so cool,&quot; you said not expecting an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Cassie said surprising you by moving and speaking. &quot;The only thing is I just found out that it hurts. It's just a dull throbbing pain and it only lasts as long as it takes me to transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sucks,&quot; you said crossing your arms and frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry I can handle it,&quot; Cassie said waving it off. &quot;It's nowhere near as painful as my first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot to make the transformation painless?&quot; you asked looking at Alexia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Alexia said. &quot;I didn't want to hurt her I just forgot to put that in. If it's any consolation I went through the same pain she did. And don't go thinking she forgot. She didn't know about the game so she didn't know that the transformation would be painful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad Nick remembered to make my transform painless,&quot; you said. &quot;I don't like pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't either but I'll have to get use to it,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;I may be switching between my forms quite a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could travel between mirrors like you can,&quot; you said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can take people with me,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;We could go now. We do have a mirror in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great,&quot; you said excited about the prospect.<br />
<br />
Before you could do that though Angela came in and said, &quot;You girls get to bed. You both have a full day tomorrow. Oh is that you Cassie?&quot; She had obviously just realized that Cassie was glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I'm not Cassie then I don't know who I am,&quot; Cassie said then giggled.<br />
<br />
You started giggling too as Angela said, &quot;Well get to bed. Cassie, Julie is going to be here tomorrow and she's going to take you till Sunday. So make sure you pack an overnight bag in the morning. And Tanya, I have something special planned for you tomorrow so get to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you and Cassie said at the same time.<br />
<br />
Angela left and Cassie changed back. You watched as she became flesh and blood again and her pajamas faded back on her. Once she was finished she laid down hugging Alexia and said, &quot;Good night Alexia, Tanya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Night Cassie, Tanya,&quot; Alexia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Night Alexia, Cassie,&quot; you said as you turned off the lamp and laid down. You wondered what Angela had planned as you drifted off to sleep.</p>
