<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look at the card. It reads: If you were a girl…<br />
<br />
1. Would your handwriting be nice?<br />
You think for a bit. Your current handwriting is absolute garbage, but pretty much all the girls in your class have beautiful handwriting. <br />
[Yes; my handwriting is very neat and loopy, with perfectly even spacing. I write about as quickly as most people write. Trying to write any other way requires constant mental attention to how I’m writing.]<br />
You flip to the next card<br />
<br />
2. Would you like pink?<br />
You think some more. You don’t really like pink; but it’s not terrible.<br />
[Kind of; it’s not my favourite colour in the world, but I don’t hate it.] You write in neat, loopy, perfectly spaced handwriting, but you don’t notice.<br />
You flip to the next card<br />
<br />
3. What would be your favourite colour, then?<br />
‘Hm, odd’ you think. It’s almost as if this card was written in response to your answer… Nah, that’s ridiculous.<br />
[I would like warmer colours, with the title of my favourite belonging to the mixture of metallic black and gold. Most of my clothes and accessories would be mainly one of those, with highlights of the other colour. A black shirt would have gold highlights, and vice versa]<br />
You don’t notice, but underneath you, your clothes change to your preferred colours.<br />
<br />
4. What would your hair be like? Please describe in detail.<br />
‘Pfft, as if I haven’t been using details,’ you think, before writing <br />
[My hair would be the same colour as pure gold, with a few dyed black streaks. The biggest one of these streaks would be one of my bangs. The main body of my hair would reach my ankles, my black bang would reach my belly button, and my other bang would reach the underside of my breast. Speaking of my hair will never be inconvenient. My hair would naturally be straight, silky smooth, and would be very thick. Aside from special events, or whenever my friends use me as a hairstyle model, it would be in two bangs, which would rest on either side of my head. The rest of my hair would be in… something like a ponytail, but only tied at the bottom.]<br />
Unnoticed by anyone, your hair virtually explodes into three strands: one on your left which reaches your belly button, one on your right that ends under the curve of your pec (you’re not a super muscly guy, but you’re not fat, either), and a main one behind you, pilling up on the floor. Your light brown hair turns gold, as if someone dropped a paint bucket on your head. Once your last strand has gilded, a black darker than the deepest night emerges from a few roots; most of it darkens your left strand.<br />
<br />
5. What would your face look like?<br />
You pause for a bit to look at your watch, not noticing the silky strands stroking your skin. It reads 8:35. You groan a bit. ‘This class starts at 8:30 and ends at 12:00. I suppose I have tons of time then.’<br />
[My face would be very elven, with high cheekbones and a pointed, delicate chin. But with a resting murder face. My lips would be soft and kissable. My eyes would be wide and piercing, with bright, gleaming silver irises. My smooth skin would be bronze. My nose would be defined, yet feminine.] <br />
You scratch your nose a bit, with no one noticing your transformation!<br />
<br />
6. What would your voice sound like? Include accents, languages, and anything else voice related.<br />
‘Oh boy, my hours of wiki walking are coming in handy today!’<br />
[My voice would be a deep, commanding, honey smooth and crystal-clear contralto, which growls easily. I would have a mix of an American, a German, and a Quebecois accent. I can speak fluent English, German, and French, along with passable Russian and Japanese, and the ability to read kanji and Cyrillic alphabets. I don’t speak very often, to the point where a few people have thought I was mute.]<br />
You clear your throat a few times, your voice rising slightly, yet deepening. Your voice sounds like you chug bottles of honey 24/7.<br />
<br />
7. What would your general body shape be like? Think (pudgy pear shaped), not (A cups with smooth hips)<br />
‘Alright,’ you think, before putting your bronze hand to the paper.<br />
[I would have a toned hourglass. My muscles would be permanently defined, but not overpowering my silhouette. My waist would be only a bit thinner than my shoulders and my hips.]<br />
You feel your body tightening, as your clothes loosen up.<br />
<br />
8. How big would your breasts be?<br />
‘Wow, getting explicit,’ you think, before looking around. After ensuring no one is looking over your shoulder, you write:<br />
[My breasts are large and perky, the size of my head. Despite their size, they will not sag, nor will my back hurt because of them. They also won’t get in the way; even if I don’t wear a bra, they won’t sway inconveniently.]<br />
On your chest, two massive globes of flesh emerge, stretching your poor shirt nearly to its limits.<br />
<br />
9. How big would your ass, hips, and thighs be?<br />
You huff a bit, and write:<br />
[My hips would be as wide as my shoulders, my ass would be round and defined, and I would have muscled, watermelon crushing thighs]<br />
You rise a bit, as your ass solidifies and bulges out. ‘Ugh,’ you think to yourself, ‘Why did I put on these tiny things?’ You still haven’t noticed anything wrong, and the only reason you’re not bearing it all to the world is that these shorts were a bit too big for you.<br />
<br />
10. What would your vagina look like? Add in any reproductive details<br />
A blush comes onto your face, as you write:<br />
[My vagina would be puffy and naturally closed. I can only get pregnant if someone else brings me to vaginal orgasm and both of us can and have consented to me getting pregnant. It doesn’t matter if the other parent is a girl, and only fingered me. If both stipulations are filled, I’ll get pregnant. The resulting child will look like our child and will be a perfect little angel. The pregnancy won’t have any side effects, such as morning sickness, swelling, cravings or anything. My stomach will only ever show a slight bump during the last month, even if I’m pregnant with octuplets.]<br />
You feel your shorts relax the slightest bit; your cock, made erect by the flood of hormones filling your body, shrinks, your testicles flipping around and becoming ovaries. <br />
<br />
11. What would you wear on an average day? Not including underwear.<br />
Fiddling with your clothes, you write:<br />
[It depends on the day and what I’m doing. But on a summer day, I’ll wear some short shorts and a crop top. On a temperate day, I’ll wear a tank-top and some regular shorts, (I don’t get cold,) and on a cold day, I’ll wear some sweatpants and a t-shirt. Once in a while, my friends and family will wrestle me into a knee long skirt and a blouse. Occasionally, I’ll wear some skin-tight pants, and a hoodie. When exercising, I’ll wear a tank-top and some yoga pants. However, two of my friends, Ollive and Rachel, have conspired together and have some fancier or skimpier clothes for me at their houses.]<br />
Nothing changes about you, but at home, your room’s (Which has become black with gold fittings,) closet changes, the graphic t-shirts, jeans, shorts, and pants shifting into various crop tops, tank tops, short shorts, and yoga pants. <br />
<br />
12. What underwear do you wear? Both top and bottom.<br />
You think about what Rachel, your fashionista friend has told you about female underwear, and get writing:<br />
[It also depends on the day, and what I’m planning to do. I don’t really care about my top, picking out either a fitted sports bra or a regular supportive bra. If I’m preparing to exercise that day, I’ll put on my sports bra. For my bottoms, I usually wear boxers; but if my pants would show it, I’ll wear panties. However, two of my friends, Ollive and Rachel, have conspired together and have some fancier and lewder underwear for me at their houses.]<br />
At your house, a couple drawers that were previously empty fill up with briefs and bras, and all your boxers expand to fit your now wider hips.<br />
 <br />
13. Would you shave?<br />
You remember Rachel complaining about having to shave, and you find body hair a turn off. Not to say you hate it, it’s just not your cup of tea.<br />
[No, I have a medical condition that makes it so that I can’t grow any hair apart from on my scalp, my eyebrows, and my eyelashes.] <br />
All your body hair falls off, tickling your skin.<br />
<br />
14. Would you wear pads or tampons?<br />
You also remember the groans of pain Rachel had during her first few periods and decide ‘FUCK THAT SHIT’. Rubbing your thighs, you write:<br />
[I would only use tampons, but very rarely. My periods are so soft and mild that I barely notice when they happen.]<br />
An unopened bag of tampons appears deep in your gold with black highlighted bag.<br />
<br />
15. What would you be wearing right now?<br />
You think about the weather, and write:<br />
[I would be wearing a supportive standard bra, a black crop top with a golden ‘fleur de lis’ over my right nipple. My black short shorts would be covering a pair of plain panties, with my black and gold sneakers and white socks. I won’t get in trouble for breaking the dress code.]<br />
After you write that last one, (Even though it’s not necessary. Everyone knows that the creep of a principal that should enforce the dress code doesn’t care about punishing the hot, pretty girls that break it, so long as they break it the right way.), you let out a soft sigh of relief. You briefly wonder why your clothes had gotten so tight, but then forget about it, and continue on to the next question.<br />
<br />
16. How often would you wear traditionally girly clothes and makeup?<br />
You look at the girl you’ve created in your mind. ‘Yeah, she doesn’t wear that stuff often,’ you think, but then realise this bombshell goddess would be fucking attacked by Rachel and Ollive. <br />
[I would never wear it by choice, but once every week I hang out with my besties, who love this kinda stuff. So, I’d probably put it on once a week, but only ever go out with stuff like it a handful of times per year. Birthdays, Holidays, and the once in a blue moon event they pick out something I like, and they convince me to.]<br />
Nothing changes yet, but Rachel and Ollive’s rooms fill with things that fit you.<br />
<br />
17. Would you be good at makeup?<br />
Even though you’d never use it, you’d like to be able to, just in case.<br />
[I’m very good at doing my own makeup, and at doing other people’s makeup, even though I never really use it. If I feel kinda fancy, I’ll put on some eyeliner and lipstick.]<br />
It seems you were feeling fancy today, as black eyeliner appears, sharpening your gaze even more. When you look at the other card, you pout, your red lips appearing especially kissable.</p>
