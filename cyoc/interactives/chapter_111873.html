<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley slowly opened his eyes. He still felt a bit tired and groggy, but some noise had woken him up. Bright daylight streamed into his room; he must have slept in quite late. Riley hoped he didn&#39;t miss any of his classes. He heard a somewhat quiet slapping noise; &quot;That&#39;s what woke me up!&quot;, Riley thought to himself. He opened his eyes fully and waited for them to adjust. As the cobwebs cleared from his head, he turned his head towards to noise. When he saw it, Riley&#39;s eyes bulged out of his head. His roommate Kyle was sitting up in his bed with his laptop. Kyle was wearing only boxers, and he was busy jacking off.<br />
<br />
Riley was shocked; his roommate was jacking off right in front of him! &quot;What the hell is this? This is totally not normal for Kyle!&quot;, he thought. He felt his head get fuzzy as more thoughts drifted in; &quot;Why am I so embarrassed; were both guys, and guys get horny&quot;. Riley still wasn&#39;t convinced that this was normal; it couldn&#39;t be.<br />
<br />
Riley just couldn&#39;t take his eyes away from his roommate doing this brazen act. Riley eyed his roommates cock, and was shocked to see how big it was. It was at least 9 inches long, and very thick. It was covered in veins and it erupted from a huge kinky bush of brown pubes. Riley was convinced that Kyle was pretty small down there, and definitely only had a small amount of pubes, however, another part of his brain was still trying to convince him this was normal. He shook his head to clear the confusion. <br />
<br />
As Kyle pumped away, obviously lost in whatever video he was watching, Riley checked Kyle out. Kyle&#39;s huge veiny forearms, which were covered in a respectable amount of brown hair, pumped up and down his huge cock. Riley saw thick tufts of brown hair peeking out from under Kyle&#39;s arms. &quot;I always keep telling Kyle to trim that&quot;, he thought to himself. A confused part in the back of Riley&#39;s head told him that Kyle didn&#39;t have any armpit hair before, but he quickly disregarded that. <br />
<br />
Next, Riley saw Kyle&#39;s torso. He saw that Kyle&#39;s shoulders were much broader. Riley spied a couple thick brown hairs that had sprouted around his niples, and a small patch of hair in the center of his chest. It wasn&#39;t much, maybe a dozen hairs, but they were thick and long. Riley also saw a large smattering of brown hair all around Kyle&#39;s belly button, trailing down to his huge bush. No matter what Riley&#39;s brain was telling him, he knew for a fact that Kyle had never had chest hair before or such a wide shoulder. He was terribly confused!<br />
<br />
As he tried to sort this out, Riley noticed something going on with himself; Under his covers, he was pounding erect. He was getting turned on by Kyle jacking off! &quot;What the hell is this? Im not gay!&quot;. Riley looked over at Kyle&#39;s cock again, and he got even harder. Riley pulled the sheets back and pulled up his boxer waistband. &quot;Oh my god&quot;, he muttered to himself; his cock was now huge! It wasn&#39;t as big as Kyle&#39;s, but it was really close! Riley snapped out of his confusion; he knew someting was up. He knew that he had always had a small cock; he even remembers getting picked on last year in the locker room about it. He glanced over at Kyle and saw how he was hairier and bigger. There was no way this was normal! They were changing somehow!<br />
<br />
Kyle glanced up from the laptop and saw his roommate staring at him. &quot;Hey Riley&quot;, he said, still intently jacking off. Riley was surprised that his voice was so deep. Kyle finally reached a climax. He grabbed a wad of kleenex off his desk, bucked his hips, and shot load after load into the kleenex. When he was done, he pulled up his boxers. His softening cock made a huge bulge in the fabric. Kyle casually tossed the kleenex on the floor next to his bed, not even bothering to throw it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what the fuck was that?!&quot;, Riley yelled at his roommate. He startled himself at how deep and powerful his voice sounded, too. His hands flew up to his neck where he found a small bump; the start of an adams apple. Kyle flashed his roommate a confused look; &quot;Bro, what are you talking about?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot;, Riley said. &quot;You were jacking off in front of me!&quot;. Kyle shrugged; &quot;Riles, what are you talking about? We already talked about this before we moved in, that we didn&#39;t care if we did it in front of the other. I do it all the time, we both do! Hell, Riley, you jack off in front of me more than I do!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s brain was having trouble processing this. Like before, he did remember jacking off in front of Kyle before, but another part of his brain, the momentarily stronger brain, was apalled at the idea and knew it wasn&#39;t true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides&quot;, Kyle continued, flashing a grin, &quot;If that is any indication, you like what you saw&quot;. Riley saw Kyle was referring to his huge erection tenting the blanket on his bed. Riley flushed bright red!. &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to go get cleaned up. See you in a few minutes Riley&quot;. With that, Kyle got up and walked to the bathroom. A few seconds later the shower turned on.<br />
<br />
Riley sat there by himself, still in shock over what had happened and the changes they were going through. Why were they getting bigger? And why was he getting turned on by his roommate? Riley knew he wasn&#39;t gay! Riley hopped out of bed and ran to the mirror on his desk. He gasped at what he saw; his face now had some light brown stubble on it. It wasn&#39;t enough to be called a shadow, more like some small stoner sruff, but he knew he couldn&#39;t grow facial hair before. He felt the hairs in awe, surprised at how thick they were.<br />
<br />
His eyes trailed down and he saw that his chest was much bigger; his pecs were still small, but they had picked up some definition. Riley also saw his shoulders were broader as well. Riley looked at his nipples, which were hard and sticking out, and saw that he too had a few thick hairs growing out around his nipples. Likewise, 5 or 6 thick brown hairs had sprouted at the center of his chest. &quot;Chest hair?&quot;, he asked, finger the hairs, &quot;What the hell is going on!&quot;. He looked further down and saw that he now had very slightly visible abs; nothing special, but still a bit noticable. He also had a strip of hair running from his naval to his pubes, although not nearly as much as Kyle. Looking past his boxers and the bulge in the front (he was not mostly soft), he saw that his feet had grown bigger too. They were now about size 12s, and he had a small smattering of brown hair dusting the tops. The hair continued up his legs giving him a nice covering.<br />
<br />
LAstly, Riley flexed his biceps in the mirror. He saw them jump up a bit. A flash of dark drew his eyes to his newly sprouted pit hair. He had a medium sized brown bush of hair in his pits. He fingered the hairs with a sense of awe; he had never had pit hair before now, or at least before a few days ago. A strong, musky smell quickly surrounded Riley. He took a quick sniff of his pit and grimaced; phew! he had some bad BO. Riley remembered learning about BO in health class, but he had never ever had it before. Taking another look at his body, Riley saw that Kyle had more pit hair and bigger biceps, but Riley was catching up.<br />
<br />
Riley walked away and glanced at the clock; it was 11:45, and his class was starting soon. &quot;I have to figure out what is going on to me and Kyle!&quot;, Riley thought. &quot;Why are we changing and getting bigger and hairier! And why is it so hard to remember what we were like before!&quot;. Riley thoughts again wondered to Kyle&#39;s cock, and his big strong arms pumping up and down. Riley felt his huge floppy member quickly get hard at the thought. &quot;And why am I getting turned on by Kyle!&quot;. Riley tried to hide his boner as he fumbled for some clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to fix this!&quot;, Riley thought to himself, as he heard the shower shut off in the bathroom.</p>
