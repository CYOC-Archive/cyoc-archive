<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole woke up with a gasp. He blinked awake, with his vision blurry. <br />
<br />
Damn...his head felt awful. His whole body ached, and his pants were...sticky? <br />
<br />
Cole groaned. Slowly, his surroundings came clear. He saw fluorescent lights on the ceiling, and blue walls surrounding him. In front of him was a table with another chair, with a door on the wall behind it. He looked left...<br />
<br />
Steph. She was in a hard chair right next to him, still in her clothes as before. She was waking up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Cole?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Steph!</i>&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god. <i>Our kids! They-</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
In front of them, the door opened. And in walked Doctor Eberheardt with a folder in her hand. A uniformed guard was outside, and he closed the door behind her. <br />
<br />
Immediately, Cole tried to jump from the seat and throw himself at the sick labcoat-wearing bitch. But he found his body couldn&#39;t get up. He looked down. There weren&#39;t any cuffs or ropes; his body below his neck just couldn&#39;t move. Same with his wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you do?!?&quot;, he yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are immobilised,&quot; said the woman, calmly. She sat down on the other free chair, and placed the folder down. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s quite reversible. Your children are still asleep. We&#39;ve given something to cover your son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; uttered Steph, in tearful disbelief. &quot;Why did you do that to our kids? What kind of monsters are you?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We never signed up for this! What kind of sick things are you running in this place?!?&quot;, exclaimed Cole.<br />
<br />
Doctor Eberheardt smiled, and raised her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please. Your family has nothing to fear, Mr Farlon. None of you are in danger, and I am deeply sorry if my experiment caused your family distress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole fumed. &quot;Fuckin-&quot;<br />
<br />
From her folder, Doctor Eberheardt pulled out a large photograph. She lifted it up to show both Cole and Steph. It looked like a microscope image, but there were dozens of strange geometric pieces that looked like 20-sided dices from board games. <br />
<br />
&quot;These are nanobots,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;Microsophic machines. Usually only simple enough for surveillance and medical monitoring, but Metamorph Inc has invented these high special ones, which can act on multiple purposes. With a combination of-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You put those THINGS in our body?&quot;, uttered Cole, once again furious. <br />
<br />
&quot;You signed the wavers, and knew the conditions. That includes the involvement of your kids.&quot; the scientist replied. &quot;You knew that the nature of the experiment was secret, and you may not be divulged on the methods used. You&#39;ve also been promised that these tests will leave no side-effects. You&#39;re not the only former test subjects we have. They&#39;ll quite happily tell you the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s it for? Mind control? <i>Is that why you did that to us?!?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s capable of that, true.&quot; Eberheardt&#39;s mouth curled. &quot;But we have more....different intentions. We&#39;re not interested in assisting government control. Our invention is for the purposes of medicine and science, as well as new fields of....recreation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did we have those dreams?&quot;, asked Steph. &quot;We had them...they&#39;re about turning into things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was to condition your mind,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;You see...besides these nanites, we have also invented a unique chemical that can drastically alter a creature&#39;s body-chemistry. With the help of nanites, we can control what these changes can be, and they can be &#39;quite&#39; drastic. We combined them into a compound called Merlin-5, which is what is currently contained in your bodies. It not only enables alternation of behavior and action...but also, of form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Form?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Merlin-5 allows for rewriting DNA, affecting the structure of bones and muscles. In simpler words...metamorphosis. It can allow humans to take many forms; be they animal, mythical creatures or everyday objects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like turning into...things?&quot;, uttered Steph, aghast. &quot;That&#39;s not possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was absurd, thought Cole. But from what he&#39;s seen today...somehow he knew that with these scientists, it could be possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to turn us...our KIDS...into god damned animals?&quot;, he uttered. &quot;You mad Frankenstein piece of shit, <b>LET US OUT.</b>&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Cole tried to leap from his chair, but it was no use. He wanted to kill her. That fucking insane witch, using their children for her sick discoveries for this twisted company. How could they?!?<br />
<br />
Cole looked ahead, and saw Eberheardt pulling out a digital tablet. Her expression was as calm and dispassionate as ever. She clicked a few buttons, and showed the screen to the couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your account number, correct?&quot;, said Eberheardt. Cole tried to calm down, as he looked at the number on the screen. It was an account page for a bank. Not Cole and Steph&#39;s shared account, this account was someone else&#39;s.<br />
<br />
But he looked further down, and saw their familiar account number on the &#39;Receiving Account&#39; box. <br />
Cole gritted his teeth. He didn&#39;t answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have ways of making people...forget,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;Should you want us to terminate your experiment, you will not remember the events of what happened here. You will be paid as agreed, of course. But only for a token sum. Not enough to stabilise your family&#39;s life situation, most likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole bit his lip. Steph let out a shaky sob. <br />
<br />
God damn it. Losing his job was hard enough. Losing the house and all their belongings was even worse. They&#39;ve also had to keep up with other debts, with moving Abby into junior high, buying groceries and paying rent for the temporary apartment. All while Cole searched far and wide for another stable job. They&#39;re already digging through some of the savings for Abby&#39;s future college fund, which they swore not to touch. But at the rate they were going, they&#39;d be run dry. They could be separated from their kids....their entire future...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alternatively,&quot; Eberheardt continued. &quot;Should you continue our experiment, not only will you earn enough to rebuild your lives...you will ALSO be given the chance to forget the events in this experiment. Whatever you do here, you and your entire family will not have to remember. Not you, nor your children. After 8 weeks, you can simply leave with your lives rebuilt, and none the wiser.&quot;<br />
<br />
The couple said nothing. They looked at each other; Cole saw tears from Steph&#39;s eyes. He wanted squeezed her hand, but they were still paralyzed. <br />
<br />
He heard the sound of tapping. Eberheardt was typing in things on her digital tablet, before giving a final tap. Nodding, she showed the tablet screen to both Cole and Steph. <br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve thousand dollars,&quot; said Eberheardt. The money had been sent right to their account. &quot;An addition to the million you&#39;ll receive at the end of this experiment. Consider it our apology for your distress tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole took a deep breath. It felt like he and Steph were making a deal with Satan himself. A deal for the family&#39;s fate. Their children&#39;s fate. <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re children,&quot; he uttered. He thought of Danny and Abby. Their dear faces. &quot;Is that what you do? Sex-experiments on kids? You actually think that&#39;s right?&quot; <br />
<br />
At that moment, Eberheardt said nothing. Then, unexpectedly, the female scientist stood up, and stepped from her seat, to around the table.<br />
<br />
Cole watched, wearily, as the scientist loomed right over him and his wife. He wondered if she was about to strike him, for questioning her morality. Whatever that sick morality in her head was. <br />
<br />
&quot;I grew up in a farm, in Switzerland,&quot; said Eberheardt. She leaned back against the table, facing the immobilized couple. &quot;I had a mother and a father who loved me, and treated me like you do to your children. I had aunts and uncles, who did the same. They were all ordinary, normal. Conservative, you could say. It was a nice life, in a most wonderful country.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment, the woman scientist looked wistful. Like seeing some far-off memory. Her eyes went to Cole.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I was 9, I put my mouth on a boy my age,&quot; she went. She looked at Steph too. &quot;I played with myself. I experimented in the mirror, when my parents were not there. I played with the animals in our farm. The goats. The dogs. The horses....I didn&#39;t fit the horses, of course. I used my mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph shivered. Cole&#39;s face reddened, as his mind imagined a Swiss little girl sucking off horses in a barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;I quite liked pretending to be them, too. And why wouldn&#39;t I, they were free! No worries, no work, just living as they are. I took walks in the woods and fields without clothes. I did things with friends who were also girls. Just for fun. But it got more fun when I became older...oh, much fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Eberheardt paused, as she looked down at the Farlons. Her eyes glowed in quiet amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody taught me. No one mistreated me. I simply learned. And what I learned was that I enjoyed my activities. All children will learn about sexual matters, in their own way, even when they&#39;re still childlike. Their secret passions, even at that young!  You two must have, as well. Your first ejaculation? Your first orgasm?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cole grimaced. He remembered, all right. He was a lanky twelve-year-old, sitting in his spaceship-decorated bedsheets with one of his dad&#39;s porn magazines. He left a mess on his schoolbag, and he thought his dick had broke.<br />
<br />
And Steph. Steph told him about experimenting with a shower head at thirteen, while thinking about one of her friends&#39; older brothers. Cole glanced at his wife, who looked aside rather guiltily. <br />
<br />
&quot;For your children,&quot; said the scientist. &quot;That moment has simply come early....until you choose to have them forget, of course. Until then, you can have them spend these 8 weeks fearing their bodies...or you can teach them otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole grimaced, as Eberheardt went back to her seat. &quot;This experiment. You&#39;ll REALLY let them forget? No side effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None at all.&quot;, she confirmed. &quot;The Merlin-5 will simply disassemble themselves, and become nothing but protein in your body. Afterwards, a separate amnesiac will be applied to your family. Not to worry, we are precise with memory excision, so you won&#39;t forget anything precious. Only memories related to this experiment, aside from your payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was silence. Both Cole and Steph said nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changing,&quot; said Steph. The tears in her ears have dried, though they were still quite red. &quot;You said you&#39;ll change our bodies? How are you going to change our kids? And us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will not be painful, for one,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;I believe I said that Merlin-5 is also intended for recreational purposes. There is quite a market for people who wish to become other things. Animals, fantastical creatures, objects...other types of people. And all reversible. It was quite difficult to achieve, but the results are marvelous.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you won&#39;t tell us what we&#39;ll turn into?&quot;, asked Cole.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will depend on circumstance,&quot; said Eberheardt. &quot;We want to gage reactions from you and your family, after all, and any behavioral changes. Sometimes it will be all of you changing, and sometimes only certain people in your family. If you&#39;re lucky, there will be occasions where you&#39;ll get to decide on your forms. Perhaps your children can become things they enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll be watching the whole time, huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eberheardt smiled thinly. &quot;Nothing that you&#39;ll have to remember. Any other questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist sat in silence. Once again, Cole and Steph looked at each other. It was insanity, Cole thought. Absolute insanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do?&quot;, Steph whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eberheardt stayed silent, though she politely backed her seat slightly, and dipped her head. She waited patiently, as the couple deliberated in near-silence, exchanging looks, nods and mutters.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, Cole and Steph. They met the scientist&#39;s cold gaze. Cole opened his mouth, though he had to put all his strength into forcing his next words.<br />
<br />
&quot;...one million and three hundred thousand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Eberheardt smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
When Cole and Steph returned (still with a foul wetness in their lower clothes and underwear) they found Abby and Danny were in their beds. The two woke up right as the couple returned; no doubt something triggered by the scientists. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy? Mommy?&quot;, said Abby, as she woke up to find her parents over her. Steph quickly wrapped her in her arms, breathing in relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, pumpkin...everything&#39;s ok.&quot; Steph stroked Abby&#39;s blonde locks. Meanwhile, Cole went up to comfort Danny, who sat up on his bed, a little dazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey buddy, everything alright?&quot;, said Cole.<br />
<br />
Danny rubbed his sleepy brown eyes. He looked rather flushed, and seemed confused. And embarassed, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll explain everything,&quot; Cole replied. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s all sit down at the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before that, though both Cole and Steph quickly changed out to some cleaner clothes, with Cole doing so in the bathroom, and Steph in her room. Fortunately, Eberheardt promised to switch off all their libidos for the rest of the night. <br />
<br />
The dinner table had been cleared by the scientists. Once the Farlons were seated, Cole and Steph gently explained everything they knew.<br />
<br />
The first thing was, awkwardly, explaining to the kids the concept of an &#39;orgasm&#39;, and also the very basics of sex. Neither of their kids had much education on human reproduction, though Abby is supposed to learn during her next school year. <br />
<br />
&quot;So that was sex?&quot;, Abby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no,&quot; said Steph. &quot;Those feelings themselves aren&#39;t sex. It&#39;s...it&#39;s how people get the urge to have sex. They feel good, and they...I guess they feel even more good when they put their parts together. Which allows people to make a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the white liquid that came out of you, Danny...&quot;, Cole added. &quot;When it goes inside a girl&#39;s vagina, that can make a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why did we all feel that together?&quot;, asked Danny. &quot;Is it the experiment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now this was the trickier part. Together, Steph and Cole explained the nature of the experiment. They talked about &#39;Merlin-5&#39;, and expressed their own righteous annoyances at the scientists.  Though they also added that they&#39;ll be able to forget this entire experience. The kids did perk up at the new amount of money they were promised (&quot;Now we can definitely buy a mansion!&quot;, quipped Danny).<br />
<br />
And then they got to the strangest part.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re really going to turn into stuff?!?&quot;, Abby exclaimed. He and Danny looked in disbelief. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Cole sighed. &quot;That&#39;s apparently what they want us to do. Turn us into animals, creatures. Not sure how, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, so I could really turn into a car?&quot;, asked Danny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they did mention &#39;things&#39;&quot;. Cole tried to wrap around the image of his son transforming into an inanimate object, Would he still be alive? He had to be, but he still couldn&#39;t comprehend it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will it hurt?&quot;, asked Abby. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, the scientists say it won&#39;t,&quot; said Steph. &quot;The lead scientist...the, uh...creepy woman, she promised it might actually feel good. Like how you did today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like...wanting sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole breathed. He and Steph tried not to comprehend it. The possiblity that they&#39;ll fall into sexual encounters with their own kids. Steph had already tasted their young son&#39;s semen by accident. Even if they won&#39;t remember, would they all really be fine with that?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be alright,&quot; said Cole, as he took both Abby and Danny&#39;s hands. &quot;They promised it won&#39;t hurt, and that it...I don&#39;t know how, but might be a little fun. If not, we won&#39;t remember any of this anyway. Except for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we do this, we can get another house, and we won&#39;t have to worry about money for a &#39;very&#39; long time,&quot; added Steph. She took his children&#39;s hands too. &quot;I promise. We&#39;ll take care of you, and we&#39;ll make sure things won&#39;t be scary.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get through this together, as a family,&quot; said Cole. &quot;Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The children looked uncertain. But they both nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Got it.&quot; &quot;Ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a bit more bravery than before, the family hugged.  <br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
The rest of the night was normal. Or at least something close to normal. <br />
<br />
Danny got a proper shower, and had no more trouble with his penis for the night. His parents had a quick rinse themselves, too. They tried to ignore the fact that there&#39;s people watching them on camera, even while they used the bathroom or undressed.<br />
<br />
Then came Abby&#39;s turn. The girl stripped herself down, and got under the warm sprinkle of water.<br />
The &#39;feeling&#39; didn&#39;t come to her. Just like her parents said, the scientists have somehow turned it off for tonight. She wondered what made those guys think it&#39;s okay to make people feel like that. Was that just something scientists do? Tease people? Make them scared?<br />
<br />
Abby half-heartedly rubbed soap on her bare skin. She remembered being afraid at seeing her parents and Danny just collapse like that, with those weird things happening to their privates. It was nothing she&#39;s ever seen her family do before. It disturbed her.<br />
<br />
And yet now, Abby knew they were feeling good, like she did that entire day! Orgasms, sex...was that all supposed to look scary? She remembered her family screaming and making weird noises. It&#39;s almost looked like they were getting hurt or dying!  How can something that feels so good look so freaky?<br />
<br />
Not only that, they were going to turn into things too. What kind of things will these scientists make them? The stuff in their dreams? Her drawings? It was like she was in some magical story, where impossible things could now exist... <br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s hand brushed by her bare vagina. Again, no feeling.<br />
<br />
She paused. Vaginas...her parents said sex had something to do with penises going inside vaginas. And her finger didn&#39;t seem as big as a penis.<br />
<br />
Tempted, Abby put a finger inside herself. There was a slight tickle. Nothing as strong as before, but it wasn&#39;t bad either. Abby licked her lips. <br />
<br />
She wanted to feel it. So far, she was the only one who didn&#39;t know what an orgasm felt like. If it was so good, she wanted to try it herself. She pushed deeper....<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Ok, not happening,</i> Abby thought, as she quickly pulled out. <br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Dr. Eberheardt took one last visit to the Observation Room, as the Farlons drifted into an uncomfortable, weary sleep. The lights of the Habitat were once again dark.<br />
<br />
Things were mostly uneventful, with both Abby and Danny falling to sleep without any &#39;self play&#39;. They did, however, talk in private, wondering what things they could be turning into, or what other things the scientists would do. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Stephanie was crying again, and Cole was there to comfort her. Dr. Eberheardt will admit, there was just a tiny tinge of guilt in watching them. But their reward will be more than enough to compensate for their current distress. Along with, perhaps, their experiences in these next eight weeks. <br />
<br />
All cameras were active, with various members of her staff looking through the Farlons habits. It was always interesting to see how test subjects react to Merlin-5 on their first nights, but tonight&#39;s event was rather extraordinary. Three simultaneous orgasms between parents and child. <i>Remarkable.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;One million and three hundred thousand dollars?&quot;, said Dr. Adam. &quot;Seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re applying transformations and behavioral adjustments of sexual nature to somebody&#39;s children,&quot; said Dr. Eberheardt. &quot;As prices go, I would say it&#39;s a fair number. It will still be affordable for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we could always make them forget they agreed to that much, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will contribute some of my salary,&quot; Eberheardt replied. &quot;A deal is a deal. Whether they remember it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eberheardt supposed it was also justified retribution from two upset parents. Though that would make the events planned for them and their kids even more worthwhile. Both as data, and as spectacle. <br />
<br />
Dr Adam shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s your money, doc. We&#39;re still having the scheduled events as planned, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eberheardt and her team had organized an entire calendar/time table of transformations and behavioral tests on the Farlons, with all 8 weeks charted out. Much of it could be rearranged or altered if required.<br />
<br />
Day 2 will be the Farlon family&#39;s first day experiencing the transformative power of Merlin-5. Currently, the plan was to have it occur in the middle of the day (like today&#39;s activation of Merlin-5). It could give the Farlons some relief in the morning, considering their distress this evening. But Dr. Eberheardt could always change thing. <br />
<br />
The woman gave another look at the experiment&#39;s schedule on the notebook. Yes, she remembered what they had planned for Day 2. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe this will all do,&quot; said Eberheardt. Tomorrow, the Farlon family are going to have quite an extraordinary experience....</p>
