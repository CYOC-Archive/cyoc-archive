<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sick feeling stomach was but the first sign the infecting semen was beginning to make some changes. Infectious as well filled with the magic that spewed from changed Drake, he by that time had run away from school and leaped a fence, found consoling comforts as he joined some mares grazing peaceably in their pasture. The same semen got by chance blended into the coffee setting on the classroom desk of teacher Merriweather.<br />
<br />
Mr Jon Merriweather, cut his teaching day short, leaving school claiming he was feeling very ill, his drive home was one with several stops. Stopping to stand and puke his day's ingested food, the more he stopped the sicker he felt.<br />
<br />
A bachelor all his life, women never seemed a worthwhile interest, they fickle and in a constant mood of jealousy one disliking another, or even spiteful of the man they were with. He found his work and the hobbies he enjoyed as his favored manner of living, lonely at times, but still he had to bow to no man or woman.<br />
<br />
Staggering hunched over forward at the waist, Jon fell onto the living room couch, as once there he fell asleep, sinking into a lulled coma as the infection raced within his entire body.<br />
<br />
Comatose, Jon knew to some degree he was in that way, and saw in his mind then a dream, he seeing the future, his new self and what others governing him would force him to do. His dream began as seeing a loony looking Genie and he with his new master, they together began the spiral of drastic changes, as student and friend Drake Fratenburger became the first to feel the envelopment of magic, he in a flash found himself changed, becoming one horny endowed donkey.<br />
<br />
Asleep and amazed, Jon moaned, as if he too were in that men's room and there with the others, he partook of helping to masturbate Drake, and affording the new donkey something he would learn to relish as he did it often. Jon heard the students laughing as he thought it humorous, especially since by some reason he knew that the donkey came to school that day, driving a car and being quite as another human male.<br />
<br />
Oddly, since Drake showed no fear from his animalistic transforming, Jon felt this as a normal sort of happening. He liked of what he helped to touch and feel, as if when the donkey blew his load, AJon messed his pants too.<br />
<br />
As the others left Drake to being a donkey in the aftermath of their arousing him and causing Drake to fully lose himself into the state of being as is a donkey, Jon walked out of the bathroom too, feeling the stickiness in his underwear, he rarely aroused like that, but this time found it a real pleasure.<br />
<br />
The scene in his dream panned away so that Jon could see an overview of the others as they began to feel and later discover their own strange affects coming from the spewed magically laden semen.<br />
<br />
As like any infection the ill health begin where in the set body is the weakest point, either in an organ or some place were the person had injured himself in the past. So as if watching from afar, Jon saw those avid young male college students going about their day, some in classes, a couple went to cross-country jogging, and one went to lie back under a tree, planning to study but soon like had Jon, the young man fell into his own life changing comatose slumber.  <br />
<br />
Seemingly relating to the sleeping student, Jon stood by this scene as if standing guard over the youth, and marveling as a human body made of itself the complete embodiment of a male donkey. Seeing as the muzzle formed, it changing, caused the head of the student to conform, becoming wholly a donkey like head.  <br />
<br />
Head heavy then it tucked tight to the expanding chest, the neck of a human lacking strength enough to hold the enlarged head upright. Snoring harshly, the kinked neck and much bigger nostrils fighting to suck in air as the body and lungs felt the race of change.<br />
<br />
Laughter turned Jon from his careful inventory of a changing human, he hearing the deep toned sound of another in his dream. He turned and met then face to face, the Genie was there, he having come to check on yet another so infected.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who the hell are you?&quot; Jon inquired of the Genie, he feeling a bit irate that someone would enter his dream and come there uninvited.<br />
<br />
Laughing in his usual uproarious manner, the Genie eyed Jon and then looking past the dreamer, did point a magical finger at sleeping Terry Andersen as he said, &quot;Change is righteous, find it your delight, waken soon be then animal, beast, and aroused to loving the bestial feelings, you are a donkey so learn quick to love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Jon took a right cross swing trying to hit the Genie, but his arm and had he saw it pass through the chin and head of the spirit. &quot;Damn you, you are cursing the lad, forcing him to want for becoming an animal, losing his link to being human, and his want for ever to be human again!&quot; Jon yelled, he hearing his own voice echo off into the distance, as the Genie put his nose to that of Jon and began to laugh again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do watch as while he sleeps he will change, awakening to be then a young donkey, he will want first to masturbate his organ, spewing from it the remaining semen of his human past, once sated, his bigger balls will produce only equine hormones, donkey sperm, and his life as a person comes to a very bestial end. As he should be your focus, do watch him change, as while you are sleeping, you too are changing, becoming one in the same but of a larger, more matured breed. Do enjoy, as when you are about to begin your adventure into the animal kingdom, I shall visit you, granting something special for you to relish.&quot; The Genie saying, as Jon remembering it, and then the magical spirit vanished in a poof of purple smoke.<br />
<br />
Angered by what he saw and heard said, Jon looked at changing Terry, he by then was completely transformed from the waist up to be likened to having been born as a donkey.</p>
