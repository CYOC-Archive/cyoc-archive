<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill thought that it wouldn’t be the best idea if he tells his wife that tomato she just blended into her energy shake, and drank is actually her adopted son. She will freak out, get confused, and kill him if she ever finds that out! The best option is to wait for her to use the bathroom, and Bill has to somehow convince her after when she uses the bathroom that she should not flush the toilet. If he asks her now, she will think that he is acting weird or suspicious, and will demand him to spill the beans on why. It&#39;s probably a good idea that Bill ask her about it once she gets back home from work...<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, he heard the door open from the master bedroom. He walks inside to see who it is, and of course it’s his wife, obviously. With Bill now seeing his wife at a much clearer view, he notices her sexy toned exposed tummy protruding out a little. Bill never ever seen his wife bloated until now!<br />
<br />
As both Layla and Bill encountered each other. &quot;Hello, Honey! Are you having a problem with something? What’s the matter?&quot; Layla said with a mild challenged look at her face. &quot;Oh, it’s nothing! I feel a little tired today, I feel like I want to take a little break for a bit.&quot; Bill answered her with much anxiety. &quot;Alright... By the way, do you know where Jeffery is?&quot; She responded back to him, as Bill’s heart sank but keeps it together, and try to act in a normal behavior. &quot;Oh! I forgot to tell you. h-He actually gone out with his friends to a convenient store to get something for breakfast, and they will be heading to school the way there.&quot; Bill answered to her in a little nervous response. &quot;...Alright! I hope he having fun with them.&quot; She said, thinking that what Bill said was the truth. He really hates lying, but it’s the only way to make this debacle of a situation less stressful to resolve…<br />
<br />
“By the way, were you the one that took my “Tomato” that was on the counter?” Bill mentioned about “it” to her. “Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t know that was yours. We ran out of them, it was the only Tomato that we had in the house. I’m sorry but, it’s now in your wife’s vigorous tummy, as fuel for my body!.. Don’t worry, I will get more tomorrow!~ What did you need that Tomato for anyways? A little snack?” She replied back to him, with a perplexed look. “u-Uh, Yes! I was going to have it as a little snack for myself… Oh! I notice that your tummy’s a little bloated. I never seen that happen to you before!” Bill replied to her as he starts to blush even more. “Yeah, I am guessing there was something that’s in one of the fruits and vegetables I put in, which isn’t really agreeing with me… I know, I look that great being bloated and all.” She said to Bill in a somewhat down mood. “What?! Don’t be ridiculous! You look fine the way you are! People won’t even notice it at all! You always look beautiful, no matter what!” Bill replied to her as he blushes, while also trying to hide his anxiety from her. “Aww, thank you honey!~” She replied back to him in a lively mood, as she begins to hug him, feeling her little bloated tummy pressing and rubbing on his chest. Which gave him a boner, in a fucked up way. “If you want, you can rub it for me!~” She lustfully replied back to him. “Really?! Are you sure?” Bill paused a little before replying back to her, and his face starts to become more beat red as the result. “Come ‘on! Don’t be shy!” She teased, as she grasps his right hand, and slowly places it on her bloated gut where Jeff is in currently.<br />
<br />
It’s smooth, stiff, and nicely warm. Bill can somewhat feel the shake sloshing around in her bloated stomach. Bill knows he’s in there, but Layla has no thought that her son is currently churning inside her, blended in with the other contents. Being how powerful Layla&#39;s digestive system is, Bill hopes that his son will enjoy the ride on what will soon come to him. That being when her system kicks into overdrive that is. Since Bill is moderately aiding her body to speed up the digestion process a little, the jogging will probably speed it up even more... Being how powerful her digestive system is by default, she usually goes to the bathroom once or twice a day, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. Oh god, now that he thinks about it. His son&#39;s journey through his loving mother will be the first time ever to see a women pretty much bare or half naked in front of him! What&#39;s worse is that it will be his own mother… Bill’s wife, Layla! With his 360 vision he will be able to see things at all angles. He will soon, taste, touch, smell, and see his mother&#39;s feminine feces by being compressed, and mixed into her past or recent meals with it. What even worse is when he will lay, and wait inside his mother&#39;s rectum for under a day or less. She will wait at the right call for her body to release her post-digested scat contents which Jeff will be a part of, out through her sexy rear’s tight puckered anus. Jeff will feel, taste, and smell Layla&#39;s anus once he is in the process of being excreted out by her unknowingly! After his escape and landing, what will tower over him will be a perfect view of his mother&#39;s female genitalia, and her backdoor in which he came out of. He will probably look completely unrecognizable, from the rest of her stool, and she will probably treat him like any ordinary turd of hers. Bill’s adopted son was once a human being, minutes ago he was a Tomato, and soon he will turn into any ordinary piece of his mother’s poop, all done by her powerful seductive body. This whole thing will mentally ruin him! He is probably scared to death on what&#39;s happening! At least he is adopted, but either or he will probably never look at his mother the same way as he did before, ever again. After this is all over…<br />
<br />
After around a minute of Bill rubbing her tummy; “God, you’re starting to tickle me! Alright, I think that&#39;s enough!” She giggles with a cheerful smile, as Bill slowly stops rubbing her tummy. “Anyways, I have to go out, and start doing my jogs. I’ll be back in about a half an hour, and once I get back I’m gonna head to the shower, then head to work.” Then suddenly a loud *GLURP* erupted from her bloated abdomen. “Ugh! And if jogging doesn’t help once I get back, I am going to take some stomach medication before I go to work… Anyways I’ll see you later, darling!~” Layla said to him, as he watches her head towards the front door to start her jog around the neighborhood. Then a devilish idea just hit Bill. “Oh alright, good luck! I am going to go to the hardware store to get some parts, in about a minute. See you later, Honey!” Bill said to her, then she replied again with an “Alright! Cya!~” as she walks out the door…<br />
<br />
Before she heads to the sidewalk to start her run, she was pulled out her smart phone, and set up her timer, and along side opened her music playlist. Listening to music while doing her jogging exercises. Before starting her jog, she takes a deep breath, and started to stretch her arms and limbs as Bill watches her through the window worried that this will all be too much for Jeff. She then went to the neighborhood sidewalk and started her jog waving at Bill through the house window, and with a little wave back as a response from Bill.<br />
<br />
What will Bill do next while his wife&#39;s out doing her jogs, getting her body going to digest her Jeff shake? Since he has the Chronivac, there are some ideas he has in mind relating with his wife. Everyone else in the house is still asleep. Maybe he wants to have some fun, and mess with Greg or Mia? He has been thinking about transforming into something inanimate for his wife to use throughout the day, so that he can keep an eye on Jeff. He is very curious on what it’s like being something that isn’t considered “living.” The possibilities are endless with that thing, but at the same time Bill is afraid to use it again. But sometimes Bill has to get over his fears, and make his fantasy a reality with the Chronivac...</p>
