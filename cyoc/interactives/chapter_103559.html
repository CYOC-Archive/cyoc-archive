<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan and his Best Friend Lucas decided to head on over to youth ministry the following day like they&#39;ve always had, like the devoted Christians they are along with the rest of their youth group members. Like the rest of the young men, both of them were discussing about the beautiful women inside their ministry, feeling incredibly aroused but abstaining due to their faith and training. A mixture of slightly boisterous yet conserved voices bounced from within their group...well except one member.<br />
<br />
Allen didn&#39;t feel like he belonged, listening to the other boys boistering about kinda annoyed him. He hadn&#39;t gotten the courage to tell anyone that he was gay, the average sized Asian sat down there alone and quietly observing his surroundings. His Long hair brushed over his head hanging loosely shoulder length, weak as he didn&#39;t exercise much , which accounts to his pale skin and gentle nature. Wearing in white converse shoes, dressed in a plain Long sleeved Green Turtleneck with brown shorts, hiding away his rainbow band tucked beneath his sleeves. He wished that they didn&#39;t implement this stupid rule about separating boys and girls, wanting to talk to his Friend Danielle about the things he was worried about, she was always such a good listener to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;BOYS! ITS PRAYER TIME! SHUSH!&quot; Their girls shouted over to them, and they happily obeyed and apologised gentlemanly, yet with a hint of masculinity. The girls giggled in response as they began their prayer, with the boys following in pursuit within their circle, palms connected. Taking turns saying in prayer with their eyes closed, except for Allen who felt butterflies after feeling the familiar,  strong grips of two other male Christians. As he tried to keep his eyes as tiny as possible, while still being able to admire the features of his fellow youth group members once again. Ryan started off his prayer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord, pls help us to be able to find us delightful wives , so the each one of us can become husbands to each of his own family, and God pray that our future children continue shining in your glory, find beautiful spouses as well, and remain homo free.&quot; Ryan said truthfully, before making a straight joke at the end, with majority of the other boys snickering at that, except Allen who felt his boner being put to shame and filled with disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;AMEN TO THAT!&quot; The boys agreed one by one, going about in the circle as Allen just listened unhappily, not even noticing he himself muttering the word &quot;Amen&quot; as his head continued to look down, feeling itself being filled with thought. Him waiting for his turn.<br />
<br />
As he thought about it, Allen became slightly frightened and worried the others may discover him and shame him for it. He had to go for casual conservative , his mind told him, saying it was the most appropriate choice in his current situation.<br />
<br />
As the rest of the boys continued to mutter their own prayers, Allen thought about the dress code he could pull off, directing him away from any lustful desire that could harm him, to a useful herded mentality. Feeling a row of buttons appear down the center as the turtleneck turned and popped down into a collar, eyes whilist still open, too distracted by his subconscious to even notice his surroundings.<br />
<br />
A pair of natural cuffs connected themselves on the sides, mini checkers popping all over the design and whole shirt turning into a Long  sleeved checkered dress shirt. The cold Breeze blew onto his legs, as Allen felt discomfort, as the next process began.<br />
<br />
His shorts grew longer down the sides, reaching down as they gave him warmth and comfort whilist turning a dark navy blue, they grew tighter and tighter , tight fitting like what normally teens and young men would like to wear, being hip and one of the crowd as they see themselves into tight fitting jeans below.<br />
<br />
The guy next to him began his prayer, as Allen glanced to right, originally staring at the bulge but eye jerking downwards to the shoes, like he wasn&#39;t supposed to commit such indecent perverse acts in public, that&#39;s what he told himself , like a new rule placed onto him. If he wanted play safe and be one of the boys he had to get used to it, taking note of the black dress shoes the man next to him wore, wiggling his toes as his own shoes becoming identical to those. With socks turning into that typical pure white Colour that most Christians enjoy wearing. Allen was pretty good at adapting, although he still felt uncomfortable with his pretend dailogue with the other guys,  but he wanted to fit in, like it was important to him. The man ended his prayer, and gave Allen&#39;s hand a tight squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...I&quot; Allen tried to come up with something to say, normally being able to spout out general things like Good grades and the such. But he felt completely shaken by what Ryan said, as though the comment and prayer left a mark, sucking away all of his generality and completely leaving his former Dick limp, yet despite that, the bulge seemed to be larger than normal regardless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Allen felt his dark brown-black bangs droop over his head, distracting him from his previous thoughts as though it became a problem all of a sudden, never ever experiencing this dislike ever before for his Long hair--? Long hair? Isn&#39;t Long hair for girls, why would he be having Long hair? <br />
<br />
His sides and back became shaved off, as his bangs became trimmed slightly and got pushed and held back by the Holy Spirit. Slicked back with pomade and styled into a conservative undercut, handsome looking yet appropriate for his presentation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree with you man.&quot; <br />
<br />
Allen&#39;s mouth moved on its own, dailogue spitting out stuff he couldn&#39;t control, agreeing with Ryan? But he was gay wasn&#39;t he? No...that&#39;s not right...is it? Huh? <br />
<br />
He felt his heart being broken into pieces , like the formal him and his crushes have been thrown away so that he could continue being one of the boys, like it suddenly meant the whole world to him. Not for the sake of blushing and arousal! He&#39;s a guy for goodness sake! He should be attracted to g..gu...g...<br />
<br />
&quot;I sincerely hope that each of us will be blessed with beautiful wives and have children as well that&#39;ll continue in our legacy.&quot; He...smiled, feeling a new yet a similar, satisfying renewal of himself. Closing his eyes and resting in heaven&#39;s embrace.Baptising away the sinful deeds of his past...past? He was never gay! Haha! Modern society has too much influence on everyone nowadays, they should be resting in the spirit and keep their faith strong like he has all these years. Abstaining and remaining pure, like a good Christian should be until they get together with their life partner.<br />
<br />
He felt his body Aging and toning in the process, not so much like the jocks within his group, but of someone who worked out decently and maintained his shape so that he could look good for his future Wife. Feeling out the jeans and dress shirt as they showed signs of firmness in his pecs, arms as well as a good amount in his legs to support his ever growing height, reaching around a 6ft right about now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! Like you and that Danielle senior am I correct?&quot; Ryan spoke out.<br />
<br />
Danielle? Wasn&#39;t she his Best Friend? Someone that can listen to him when he was feeling down? Someone that could always be by his side and sing lovely worship songs together with him? Someone that he felt genuinely attracted to? Why yes that Danielle. He felt his jaw reshaping to her interests, as he doned several Asian-American features that she adored in him. Friendly, but confident and dependable eyes that she adored in him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha!&quot; He coughed, feeling a deeper, sexier yet a slightly boyish voice coming from within his system.Neck adjusting as it grow proportionate to his body. Danielle was head over heels for him, and likewise was he for her gorgeous features and body, as well as the lovely personality she had. Feeling blush rising to his face like never before. True genuine, martial love like God had always wanted for him for all these years , and he was going to get it.<br />
<br />
The rainbow bracelet faded away in Colour, as it solidified into a men&#39;s watch Danielle got for his birthday, as he thought of all the wonderful things he did with her, a true sense of happiness dawned on him. As a handsome Christian man in his early twenties, graduated college in pursuit and devoted his life to his church and God, being a member of the church band and choir. He tightened his left hand, as a silver, engraved ring dawned on his finger, a show sign of his trust with his fiancé. With that being said, it is without a doubt that Lennard is definitely a true man like his peers, already garning their respect from day one with his charismatic personality as well as also being the shoulder his brothers in the house can lean on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big Brother&#39;s going to get married with Dani once she&#39;s finished with college. And you guys are all invited!&quot; The men cheered quietly! Maintaining their voices like Big bro has reminded them too, guiding them to their life partners and giving them the nudge to make the move on the girls, they were thankful and respectful to him in every aspect, being the true alpha of the wolf pack amongst all of them.<br />
<br />
Lennard expertly and calmly finished off the rest of his prayer, enlightening the rest of his group as the other beside him continued to say their prayers until they&#39;re done. Once finished, he gathered the group as their leader towards the girls, already finishing the prayer before them. He held Danielle&#39;s hand and gave a kiss to her cheek, the lovebirds and big sibling figures blushed happily as they only taught of the happiness each other brought to them.</p>
