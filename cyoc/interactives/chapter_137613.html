<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa and Marilyn frowned as they searched through some of Gloria’s old clothes. Thankfully Gloria seemed to be okay, while the girl was acting more like a 6 year old than the 14 year old they were accustomed too, she appeared to be mostly herself.<br />
<br />
“Doing okay Gloria,” Lisa asked as she opened up yet another box. Gloria nodded as she gazed around the room. “I’m okay mommy,” she said. “I’m really bored though, can I go and play now?”<br />
<br />
“Soon sweety we just have to find you something to wear.”<br />
<br />
Lisa now pulled out a dress that appeared like something Gloria would probably have worn for the holidays. “Oh that’s pretty mommy,” Gloria exclaimed. “Can I wear that one?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Lisa shrugged, tossing the girl a dress. Gloria squealed in excitement as she quickly changed into the dress. The girl now pirouetted in front of her mirror as she admired her appearance. “It’s so pretty,” she said happily. “Can I keep Mommy? Please.”<br />
<br />
“Sure Gloria,” Lisa said sweetly. Gloria squealed with joy as she now began jumping happily. Although Lisa had yet to find any shoes or socks for the girl she would at least be dressed. Sighing she now looked at her mother who had a look of annoyance on her face. “What is it mom,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
“You really need to have a talk with that future daughter of yours Lisa,” Marilyn frowned. “I know mom,” Lisa sighed. “And I will. I can’t have her useing crazy magic like this around the house. I’m just thankful it’s only Gloria that’s been affected so far.”<br />
<br />
As the two adults now stood in Gloria’s room they could hear childish giggling and footsteps racing up the stairs. Curiously they looked out into the hall, both sighing at what they saw. “You gotta be kidding me,” Lisa groaned.<br />
<br />
Jackie, Ann, and Stephanie were now barely 12 years old now. The three preteens seemed to be having the time of their lives as they giggled happily amongst each other. The girls were trying to  to keep their overly large clothing on their diminutive bodies as they raced towards Gloria’s room, their socks flapping behind them, dangerously close to falling off their small feet. Lisa now stepped into the hallway, glaring at the three girls in annoyance.<br />
<br />
“Seriously you three,” Lisa groaned.<br />
<br />
The girls stopped in their tracks as they sheepishly gazed at Lisa. “Hey Lisa,” Ann squeaked. “Was hoping you could find some clothes for us to wear.”<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as her mother came behind her. The elderly woman angrily gazing at her daughter and her friends. “Ann what were you thinking,” she said sternly. “Don’t we have enough problems without three more children in the house.”<br />
<br />
Ann blushed as she guiltily looked down at the floor. With the loss of so much of her maturity she felt like a little girl in trouble. No matter how much she wanted to stand up for herself and say she was a grown woman, she couldn’t. Her young instincts were just too overpowering. As she tried to answer the three girls glowed once more.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Marilyn watched in shock as the three 12 year olds began to grow smaller. What assets of puberty the girls had were quickly wiped away as they descended towards childhood. The girls seemed to melt into their clothing as they grew smaller and younger. When the glow finally faded three 6 year old girls looked guiltily up at the two adults. Their pants, finally becoming too large cascading down their legs as their shirts looked like dresses now.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry mommy,” Ann whimpered. “We just wanted to play.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn sighed as she looked at the girls. As disappointed as she was at Ann becoming a child, it was difficult to be angry. Looking at the small blond girl she was reminded of Ann’s first childhood. The girl had always been such a sweet natured girl and was easily the easiest of the three sisters when she was that age. Rubbing her eyes as smiled before turning to Lisa. “Hard to be mad when she looks like that,” she mumbled. “Do you think you can find something for these three to wear Lisa.”<br />
<br />
“Might as well,” Lisa groaned. “Really don’t need these three running around with clothes.”<br />
<br />
After searching for outfits for Ann, Jackie and Stephanie Lisa was finally able to find some outfits that fit the girls. Deciding on some old holiday dresses Gloria had worn as a child she passed them out to the girls, much to their delight. Dressing quickly the three girls now admired the dresses in Gloria’s mirror.<br />
<br />
“Their so pretty,” Stephanie said dreamily. “Thank you Mrs. Turner.”<br />
<br />
“Um Your welcome Steph.”<br />
<br />
“Lisa do you have any shoes,” Ann whined as she looked down at the girls bare feet. “”Umm no,” Lisa snorted. “And theirs no way I’m spending money on shoes for you four. Your just going to have to deal with it.”<br />
<br />
 Ann frowned grumpily at her sister before Jackie pulled her to her side. “Cmon Ann,” she said happily. “Who cares about shoes. Let’s go watch cartoons. Gloria turned on My Little Pony downstairs.”<br />
<br />
Ann squealed with joy as the girls now raced downstairs to join Gloria. As Lisa listened from upstairs she coluld hear the four 6 year olds happily laughing as they sang songs and played. “Well at least they seem to be enjoying themselves,” she smirked. “Too bad we can’t join them but I guess someone needs to be the adult.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you would even consider joining the four of them,” Marilyn grumbled. “Lisa your a grown woman, and preganant. You need to grow up and take responsibility for your house.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously mom,” Lisa said flatly. “Already do that. You’ve seen how Katie and Gloria are. And for the record run my own business so I’m Adulting just fine.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn paused, she wanted to give a retort to Lisa but found her daughter had a point. Lisa was doing quite well for herself and succeeding beyond her expectations. As much as she hated to admit it, her daughter was truely a grown and independent woman.<br />
<br />
“Your right Lisa my apologies,” she mumbled.<br />
<br />
“Hmm that sounded like an apology,” Lisa grinned, to which Marilyn only frowned. Placing her arm around her mother she sighed as they began to make their way downstairs. “I appreciate that mom,” she said. “I learned from you so hope your proud of the woman I’ve become. Still, sometimes, you’d be surprised how much fun it is being a kid again. Even if it’s just for a little while.”<br />
<br />
“Please tell me your not considering useing Lynne’s powder,” Marilyn said with concern.<br />
<br />
“Haven’t made up mind,” she smirked. “What I do know is that we have four 6 year olds unattended downstairs. Pretty sure we better go keep an eye on them.”<br />
<br />
As mother and daughter went downstairs they smiled and laughed softly with one another. Christmas was going to be interesting this year.</p>
