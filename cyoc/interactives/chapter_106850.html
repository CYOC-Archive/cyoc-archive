<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blake and Ton, short for Anthony, were friends hanging out at the mall. They were 14 and had several hours before Blake&#39;s mother expected to pick them up. They had already gone through a few bucks at the arcade and browsed through the cooler stores. You know, the ones filled with trendy nick knacks, black lights and snarky shirts that would be questionable at best but are more likely banned by the schools dress code policy for the swears, sex, drug, or alcohol references. <br />
<br />
Having done the main things they wanted to and still having plenty of time to kill, they began walking to the &quot;as seen on TV&quot; store. Its occasionally good for a laugh. Why would I use a rag when I could spend 49.99 on this product that will complete the task just as quick?<br />
<br />
As they walked toward their destination the crowds became grew thin and slowly waned to just a few people. There was an empty storefront here and there, some had a coming soon sign some didn&#39;t. In one of the shops that were still holding on, Blake saw a big sign over a tie display that read &quot;Father&#39;s Day Special!&quot; Looking closer it said, &quot;Bring a friend into the store and your tie is free!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake grabbed Ton and dragged him into the store. it had a ton of curios, nick-knacks, and it all seemed out of place. None of the brand names were recognizable. Chef Susan&#39;s Kitchen Set was next to a display for Sassy Mouth Lip Balm, which was next to an Altered Fate&#39;s Halloween Mask, which had Harry&#39;s Handsome Straight Razor Shaving Kit next to it.<br />
<br />
Ton stopped right inside the door not sure what to make of his suddenly chaotic surroundings. he put his hand through his neck length black hair and asked Blake why they are here. Blake just flashed his winning smile and pointed to the sign. Ton could see the excitement flash in his light blue eyes and decided not to mention that something felt very off about this store. Similar to how the perfume hung in the candle stores Ton could feel the weight of something but couldn&#39;t place it.<br />
<br />
Blake was already heading up the aisle asking if anyone was manning the store. Ton just watched as his wavy blonde head disappeared. With a sigh, Ton hesitantly took a step in and looked at the items closest to the door.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Blake reappeared with an old man in tow and pointed to the tie display. &quot;You realize Father&#39;s day is past right? I brought my friend in here so I get a tie.&quot;, Blake said motioning to Ton. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right young man. No strings attached, though I would appreciate it if you would at least look around to see if there is anything else you would like.&quot; With that the old man shuffled back to his post in the back of the store. Blake smiled and began eyeing the ties.<br />
<br />
Ton&#39;s skin was crawling, he could feel something all around him trying to get in. It was maddening because he could feel it so clearly but there was no indication of what &quot;it&quot; was. He isn&#39;t allergic to anything but his body is clearly having a reaction to something... &quot;Hurry up man, this place is making me stir crazy.&quot; he called to Blake, not knowing how else to express his discomfort.<br />
<br />
Blake didn&#39;t register that Ton was speaking, he was engrossed by the ties. He had no intention of giving it away, one day he will need a tie for a job interview or a school dance and now he will have one. All the ties appeared to be of high quality, and many of them had designs that were pleasing to his eyes. His gaze settled on a black, silver, and purple tie that somehow expressed class and fun at the same time. Blake loved it.<br />
<br />
Blake picked it up and began looking for a mirror, Ton was beginning to feel less panicky and more intrigued by what he was feeling in the store. He realized that when he picked something up, he would have varying degrees of... whatever that feeling was... all the shaving kits felt the same, all the socks felt the same, all the lip balms felt the same but they all felt very different from one another. <br />
<br />
Blake found a mirror, and much to his surprise he had tied the tie around his neck, which was no small feat seeing that he had never done it before. Blazing past the weirdness in true Blake fashion, he took the opportunity to cinch the knot up and tried to imagine what it would look like with a dress shirt on. Imagination was not Blake&#39;s strength but he thought it would look okay.<br />
<br />
Blake headed back to Ton to let him know they could leave if he really wanted to. He found Ton with his eyes closed waving his hands over displays. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Startled Ton looked up, dropping his arms to his side, his face flushed with embarrassment. In that moment Blake felt a sudden, powerful and deep connection to Ton, unlike any other he had ever felt. In a single action he glided over to Ton and kissed him for a long second. Ton was stunned and couldn&#39;t move but he felt the presence of the tie and felt it washing into him. When the kiss ended Blake looked dazed and Ton asked &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake didn&#39;t respond for a second and then said,  &quot;Oh hey, we can leave whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot; seemingly oblivious to what just happened. Ton stared back dumbfounded. They had discussed the girls in class and who was cutest. They had placed bets on who would be hottest by end of high school. Neither he nor Blake were gay, it didn&#39;t make sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to talk to the clerk for a few minutes, feel free to look around some more.&quot; Ton didn&#39;t wait for a response he, headed to the back.</p>
