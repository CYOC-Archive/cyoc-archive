<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What?&quot; Finn repeated. He was still in a bit of shock. He had specifically written that &#39;Jeff is uninterested in the Chronivac,&#39; yet, here he was specifically wanting to make a change.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man. Before he gets back. I want it to be a surprise,&quot; Jeff flexed his fingers as to tell Finn to hurry up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to change,&quot; Finn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon I want it to be a surprise,&quot; Jeff said. Though he was still thinking about the bedroom that he destroyed. He had a few other ideas, but that was his only real reason for wanting the reality altering device. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, that doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his eyebrow cock at the statement. His tone went cold. &quot;What doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot; Instantly, Finn froze up. He sat perfectly upright in his chair. &quot;What doesn&#39;t make sense?&quot; He stared daggers at Finn. &quot;First, make the bartender drop all three margaritas on Dave,&quot; Jeff ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot;<br />
<br />
The growl emanating from Jeff made Finn know he was serious. Finn pulled out the Chronivac and typed in the sentence. The bartender slipped and all three margaritas went spilling onto Dave. &quot;Shit!&quot; followed by apologies, commotion and promises of a free meal. Dave waved over at them as he went to the back to clean himself up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Jeff paused, holding back his anger, &quot;What did you change about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... Well...&quot; Finn squirmed under the interrogation. &quot;First I made it so that whenever you have sex with me your loads are twice as large as usual.&quot; Jeff&#39;s whiskers twitched. The anger on his face softened, but he remained stern. &quot;And I made it so you only wore a jock at practice, and that your pre allows any man&#39;s hole the flexibility to fit your cock completely, and that it would be some of the best sex that man has ever had, and that it would turn them into a bit of a furry and if they had sex with you in too frequent of succession, they would become a full-fledged furry too. And that you can have sex as often as you want and it still feel like you haven&#39;t had sex for like three days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is--Is that all?&quot; Jeff felt his tail swish behind him. None of that sounded bad at all. He always just figured he was lucky that his pre was so versatile, but if that was because of Finn, then could he really be mad? &quot;But then... Why&#39;d you say it was weird that I wanted to use the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Finn caved in on himself. &quot;Cause I kind of made it so you weren&#39;t interested in it anymore...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jeff&#39;s mouth hung open as he realized that the moment Finn got the Chronivac was also the moment he was no longer interested in it. He took a drink of his water. &quot;Okay...&quot; he breathed really trying to think things through. &quot;And I guess it&#39;s not that I&#39;m interested in the Chronivac, I&#39;m just interested in fixing my mistake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re mistake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took another breath. A smile broke through the corner of his mouth as he thought about the overwhelming sexual experience he&#39;d had in Dave&#39;s room. &quot;I may have made a mess in your dad&#39;s room,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me. Suddenly, I was overly stimulated and the next thing I knew the entire room was destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah really,&quot; Jeff snorted a laugh. &quot;I was just going to use it to fix my mistake and then maybe have a bit more fun with your dad tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Oh. Oh!&quot; Finn paused between each one as he realized what Jeff was suggesting. &quot;Fun like how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... Make him 21 like us and then go out to a club?&quot; Jeff shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think he&#39;d want to?&quot; Finn asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff pointed his claw at Finn&#39;s phone. &quot;There&#39;s a way to make sure he has a good time tonight. Just make it so he&#39;s physically 21 again and then when he wakes up he&#39;ll be back to his original age. Just so there doesn&#39;t have to be any weird shenanigans with him not being your father but being your father. Something like spilling margaritas on him cause him to age backwards at a rapid rate but he&#39;s never noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn snorted a laugh at the idea. &quot;Okay,&quot; he happily went typing away at his phone. &#39;Whenever my dad drinks around me and people my age, he regresses to my age so I know I&#39;ll have a friend. In his slightly drunken state, he doesn&#39;t realize what happened and is just happy and excited to hang out with me.&#39; <br />
<br />
Watching Finn&#39;s orange tail wag wildly, Jeff was starting to get curious. &quot;What&#39;d you change?&quot; he asked. &quot;Can&#39;t I know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right,&quot; Finn changed the perception so Jeff would know as well. &quot;But let&#39;s see if you can guess.&quot; As he hit enter, dozens of happy memories of him and his father hanging out on Friday and Saturday nights filled his memories. He remembered having several friends over and playing games into the wee hours of the morning and no one ever said a thing. Sometimes Dave would wake up on the floor with a bit of a headache but would go about making breakfast as though nothing out of the ordinary happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re playing that game again?&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he kept a smile on. At least this time he&#39;d actually have a chance. &quot;Hey. But don&#39;t forget about his room. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Finn quickly added another line of text and hit enter. &quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jeff leaned over, poking his boyfriend. Just as they finished the waiter brought around a fresh batch of margaritas and apologized for the accident. Dave was going to be getting a free meal along with a free drink. However, the two were more surprised to see him come out of the bathroom rocking some fairly small booty shorts and a t-shirt that was at least a size too small for him. It showed off his meaty belly and thick burly arms. Whether he ripped the sleeves off on purpose or not was yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all they had,&quot; Dave grumbled at the clothes he was wearing. The shirt had the logo across the front with a blast of colors behind it. Jeff shot a concerned look to Finn, who only shrugged at the strangeness of the situation. &quot;At least they got our drinks out.&quot; He quickly took a sip and the anger on the ram&#39;s face started to dissipate. &quot;God damn that hits the spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave took another long drink of the margarita in front of him. It instantly drained down into his belly. Finn pulled out his phone and typed something. The waiter instantly returned with a fresh one. &quot;We&#39;re so sorry about that,&quot; the waiter said. &quot;Here&#39;s another one on the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww man, thanks bro,&quot; Dave said. He took another sip and let out a heavy sigh. &quot;Almost makes it worth it. Don&#39;t it?&quot; His posture changed to something far more comfortable than it had ever been. The stuffy authority he normally tried to take relaxed into a more comfortable position. His legs spread wide while he leaned back in his chair. &quot;You know,&quot; he took another sip. The gravel in his voice softened as he spoke. &quot;I always wondered if there was something there. Never wanted to say nuthin. Didn&#39;t want ta scare you off. But, buddy,&quot; his hand gripped Finn&#39;s shoulder, shaking it lightly, &quot;I&#39;m glad you finally took that step.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Finn&#39;s orange fur on his face seemed to turn brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it man,&quot; Dave took another drink.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared blankly at the Ram. He could tell something was different, but not quite figured it out. The way the man spoke was obvious, but there was something about his body as well. The heavy-set build was shifting from his belly to his chest and shoulders. They widened more, making the shirt somehow look even smaller than it had been. It seemed to stretch and strain as the fibers cried out as though they were going to snap. His arms didn&#39;t change size, but the flabby nature turned more into a strongman. With a clear set of muscle underneath the fat that was used to stabilize him. <br />
<br />
It was same with Dave&#39;s face as the heaviness of age left it. His eyes were brighter and sharper, but not nearly as narrow. And it looked like he&#39;d tried to dye some of his white fur black when he was in college. &quot;What?&quot; Dave asked. &quot;I&#39;m not being a third wheel am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Cause he&#39;s basically a son ta me,&quot; Dave smiled. He leaned around the small table to give a few light punches to Jeff&#39;s arm. Then played the concerned parental figure, holding Jeff by the shoulder. &quot;I&#39;ve raised that boy from a wee lad and would hate to already see him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir,&quot; Jeff played up the father part. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to have him home by midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thata boy,&quot; Dave gripped his shoulder. &quot;But you two better not think this is all we&#39;re doing tonight to celebrate. Right? We need to actually have a bit of fun. So, what&#39;s next?&quot;</p>
