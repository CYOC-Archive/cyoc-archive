<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last day of camp was always like trying to make sense of a kicked anthill, but somehow Alex made do. Breakfast was served up then everyone was sent back to their cabins to pack up. Campers first of course. Counselors would leave later in the afternoon. Alex had had a good weekend, every single counselor had elected to stay, that was always a rare but welcome event.<br />
<br />
The first to leave were of course the campers that wouldn&#39;t be staying, which was most of them. Their bags packed, Alex led the milling crowd to the parking lot. As they passed through the camp gate and into the gravel lot the world spun. Alex shifted his shoulders uncomfortably as he felt himself become human again. He would skip that if he could.<br />
<br />
As the campers crossed the threshold they snapped back into their old human forms. The memories of their lives completely returning as their memories of camp would always be a little foggy but enjoyable. They&#39;d never be able to put their fingers on why they had felt like kids again, or what was so strange about the camp, but it would always be a fond memory. Adult weekend made it easy though, as the kids all snapped back into adulthood and started filtering to their various cars, driving off with a final wave for Alex. Those that had left someone behind who had decided to stay would find their memories filling with reasons, or the person just disappearing from memory altogether.<br />
<br />
Alex sighed as he crossed back, giving himself a shake as his fur once more settled back into place. Already the parents of campers were arriving to pick up their kids.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
One van pulled up and a middle-aged lop-eared bunny woman hopped out of the driver&#39;s side. George went right up to her and pulled her into a hug. She was a smaller woman, but oddly for a bunny was on the curvy side. Todd could see where he got his great ass from. He hung back and let George and his mother talk.<br />
<br />
A few younger rabbits were already running up and piling into the van, the woman counting them then looking to George. &quot;Where&#39;s Marty?&quot;<br />
<br />
George laughed and pointed over to another part of the parking lot where Marty and Ollie were exchanging goodbyes. &quot;Saying goodbye to his new crush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crush? My little Marty?&quot; She gushed. &quot;Oh.. they are cute together, aren&#39;t they? Are you really going to let your little brother beat you like that. I want to see my oldest taken care of, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; George said, &quot;Actually, I want you to meet someone.&quot; He took the bunny woman by the paw and led her over to where Todd was standing, awkwardly trying not to look like he was lurking. &quot;Mom, this is Todd, my boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, Mrs. Quicklegs.&quot; Todd said in his best &#39;I&#39;m a good guy, honest&#39; voice.<br />
<br />
She looked Todd up and down once quite critically, and Todd was almost certain she was going to give him a tongue lashing, then ended up on the receiving end of a bunny hug. &quot;Oh, well aren&#39;t you a catch.&quot; She waved George off. &quot;Go get Marty while I have some words with Todd here.&quot; <br />
<br />
George suddenly looked very worried but went to do as his mother told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am?&quot; Todd asked, once again not seeming so sure of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me tell you a little secret about Quicklegs men. They are utterly insatiable in bed.&quot; George&#39;s mother started, Todd felt his cheeks flushing. &quot;More so than most rabbits. If you let them they will be bugging you morning, noon, and night. The secret is to give them just enough to keep them happy, but not so much that they completely wear you out. It also keeps them on the hook. Also, they like having their tails played with more than they will ever admit. Trust me, I&#39;ve managed mine for over twenty years.&quot; She looked at Todd and laughed. &quot;Oh don&#39;t be so embarrassed. If you&#39;re going to be joining a rabbit family you have to learn we&#39;re very open about these kinds of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot; Todd said, still blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lad.&quot; She patted Todd on the cheek, turning and smiling as George approached with Marty. Off on the other side of the parking lot, Ollie was getting in a car with his parents. Marty gave one last wave to his new boyfriend from across the parking lot and loaded up in the van with his siblings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Todd and I were thinking of stopping by for a day or two before heading back to school, if that&#39;s alright with you?&quot; George fell in next to Todd, putting an arm around his monkey&#39;s waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to! And I&#39;m sure your father will want to meet him, too. Good thing I was planning a large dinner tonight. You&#39;ll be leaving soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A few hours.&quot; George confirmed, &quot;We&#39;ll head right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting!&quot; George&#39;s mom hopped in the van and soon was driving off and out of the parking lot, one of the last of the parents to leave with their campers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she want to talk to you about?&quot; George asked Todd, suddenly sounding very worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;She offered me advice for keeping you, um, satiated in bed.&quot; Todd answered honestly, because he couldn&#39;t think of a convincing enough lie to cover for the odd conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;She would.&quot; Was all George said before turning to head back to the cabins. Todd idly wondered what he had gotten himself into.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Having gotten his paycheck from Alex. Liam was now in the parking lot, tossing his gear into the back of his pick up truck. He was also glad to be out of that uniform, back in his cargo shorts and a short-sleeve plaid button up. He had even pulled out his hair gel and got his blue mohawk standing back up on top of his head. He felt like himself again. Those uniforms really were the worst part of an otherwise good job.<br />
<br />
Grayson slammed the hatch back of his surf wagon shut. He likewise was back in normal dress, which was a pair of shorts printed with bold hibiscus flowers and a white tank top that showed off his lean body beautifully. They really did look like a mismatched pair, at least until their eyes met and the both smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;ll see you back at school then?&quot; Grayson asked as he scooted in closer to his new boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Liam gave the otter&#39;s ass a little squeeze.<br />
<br />
There was a whooping cheer at that from Todd as he and George drove by in Todd&#39;s old convertible on their way past. &quot;You show him, Liam!&quot; Todd called as they pulled out of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Liam shook his head. &quot;I have a feeling those two have decided we&#39;re all friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are worse friends to have.&quot; Grayson said with a small laugh. &quot;Though.. how about we catch dinner and a movie tonight after getting back. I&#39;ll meet you at the student union around seven?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Alex watched as two of the last three cars pulled out of the parking lot and onto the road. Liam and Grayson both headed back to the college most of the counselors were now attending. He headed over to the last car himself, dropping into the driver&#39;s seat with a heavy sigh. Summer was almost over, which meant only a couple more weekends at camp before going to his new day job teaching at a certain high school that both Marty and Ollie would be at. Wouldn&#39;t his campers be excited?<br />
<br />
He knew most of those relationships would hold. He met his own wife at this camp seven years ago. It was strange knowing they used to be two male roommates, but it wasn&#39;t a thought that came up unless he really thought on it. He sent her text letting her know he would be home soon, and got a pic of her and the baby waving in return.<br />
<br />
The camp really did know just what people needed.</p>
