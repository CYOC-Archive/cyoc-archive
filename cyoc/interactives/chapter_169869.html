<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her brother&#39;s voice sent her heart fluttering and her dick throbbing. She couldn&#39;t believe herself, 5 minutes ago she was in complete control and now just the sound of his voice made her almost blast the door open to get to his lovely...warm.... moist.... vagina. She shivered and put her mouth on her dick. The taste of his juices was getting less, she needed fresh, she needed more. <br />
Again there was a knock on the door followed by a careful voice &quot;Kat are you there?&quot;<br />
She almost came from his voice. But if she stayed quiet he would leave her and she could find a cure. But she needed him so badly. &quot;Okay Kat, get it together.&quot; She whispered. There was no way that dipshit with that lovely...warm....moist...vagina was going to see her like this. &quot;C...coming.&quot; She heard herself say. Damn it.<br />
She put the heels away, but her hand wouldn&#39;t let go. It took all her power to force it. &quot;Okay Kat, you cannnn do this. And I&#39;ll find a counter spell after.&quot; She whispered to herself.<br />
<br />
She got up and tried to zip her pants. &quot;Fuck&quot; She whispered. The erect cock remained, it wasn&#39;t merging with her body anymore. She needed to cover it up, he couldn&#39;t see her like this. She snatched her bathrobe and put it on, tying it together. Now she could open the door and see her moronic brother with the hot....sexy....vagina... &quot;No, get it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan stood waiting, it took forever before his sister opened the door. If she hadn&#39;t answered he would&#39;ve thought she&#39;d left somehow. His knees were starting to hurt and the weight of his belly was pushing on his bladder. Finally the door opened. Kat was in her bathrobe and she looked terrible. Her face was red and sweaty and her eyes seemed to have a wild glare to them.<br />
&quot;Umm, are you okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yesss. Now what? Or do I need to point you to more changessss.&quot; Kat hissed.<br />
&quot;No..No, please don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat could barely contain herself. She&#39;d wanted to swing the door wide open, but found herself needing to clutch the door itself to stop her from launching herself at Dan. He was saying something about his belly and giving birth. She didn&#39;t care, she just wanted him to bend over and open that lovely little twat of his. One hand started stroking her hard dick through her robe, oh yes, she would plunge that in and show him how to please a woman. Wait, why wasn&#39;t he on the floor asking for a dick? This was annoying her right? No, it wasn&#39;t. She didn&#39;t find him annoying, she found him irresistible.<br />
&quot;So you see Kat, please undo this pregnancy.&quot; Was the only bit she&#39;d heard before he finally stopped flapping his mouth. She should&#39;ve just turned that into a vagina, when he was in the egg.<br />
But she had an idea.<br />
<br />
Dan was confused, Kat didn&#39;t seem to be listening at all. She just seemed to be staring straight through him. She seemed annoyed, but he wasn&#39;t crawling on the floor asking for dick like he did earlier, so he was obviously wrong. What was going on here?<br />
&quot;Okayyy &#39;Dan&#39;&quot; She said, each word sounded like she had to focus on them to come out. &quot;I will end yourrr pregnancy, come on.&quot;<br />
The door swung open and Kat stiffly walked away as Dan waddled after her. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re okay sis? You don&#39;t look so good.&quot;<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; She turned around to face him. &quot;Drop your pants!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not m..&quot;<br />
&quot;DROP THEM!&quot;<br />
As fast as a highly pregnant man with an impossibly huge dick and balls could he dropped his pants.<br />
<br />
There he stood. With his pants around his ankles. His useless massive dick and balls dangling freely. She should&#39;ve just shrunken it into nothingness, then she would&#39;ve seen his lovely mound already. She could smell his lovely...warm...moist vagina from here. She could almost taste it. She was going to fuck him in a few moments. She just needed to keep it together for a few minutes.<br />
She waved her hands.<br />
<br />
Dan stood there watching. What was she doing. He suddenly felt a tingling in his groin, he was getting aroused by this. Was this her doing, or was he getting turned on by standing here naked before his sister? Was he that fucked up?<br />
His massive dick slowly inflated, becoming as long as an arm and throbbing for attention. His pussy warmed up and started to beg to be touched. &quot;Kat, how will this help.&quot; He said breathing heavily.<br />
She barely seemed to hear him, she just mumbled something about natural lubricant. She wasn&#39;t going to have him lay that monster egg right? What the hell was wrong with her? And why did his chest suddenly feel a bit wet and cold. He looked at his shirt. Two wet stains had appeared on his chest. He pulled on his collar and tiny streams of milk were leaking from his nipples.<br />
&quot;Oh my god Kat, I&#39;m lactating! I need to get rid of this pregnancy right now!&quot; <br />
He was feeling uncomfortable. His pussy was aching, his dick was throbbing and leaking precum. When was this egg coming out, it took all he had not to start playing with himself before her.<br />
<br />
If she wasn&#39;t so horny, seeing him leak milk like this would&#39;ve send her crashing to the floor laughing her ass off. <br />
But not now, Kat felt her cock oozing precum. She needed it so badly, she could imagine his warm pussy squeezing her dick. The smell of his wet pussy was overwhelming. &quot;It&#39;sss not coming out&quot; she said, of course it wasn&#39;t this was an arousal spell. Not an ending pregnancy spell. But that hot sexy cunt before her didn&#39;t know that. Now for part two of her plan: &quot;I read somewhere that having ssssex can expedite things. How about I ffffuck YOU?&quot;</p>
