<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spencer and Kai continued to walk around the pet shop looking at the animals around. Spencer couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit surprised as just how big of a store this was for something in the mall. Or just how many animals there were to take care of. Though, based off the single employee, it was hard to tell if he would have any free time at all. <br />
<br />
They continued to the back of the store to find a self-serve pet washing station. &quot;Hey,&quot; Kai suddenly got energetic again. &quot;How about I wash you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Spencer growled. &quot;Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Kai pointed at the washing station. &quot;I used to cut my friend&#39;s hair all the time. And you look like you could really use a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly...&quot; Spencer glared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly,&quot; Kai smiled. He placed some of Spencer&#39;s shaggy hair in between his fingers. &quot;Or do you think this is going to impress your job interview tomorrow?&quot; <br />
<br />
It&#39;s not like Spencer didn&#39;t know that he was right. He just didn&#39;t like getting called out on it. &quot;And what if someone sees us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We get kicked out?&quot; Kai scrunched his face like that was the obvious answer. &quot;Duh. Come on. Let&#39;s do it.&quot; He started pushing Spencer all the way into the back of the store. &quot;Look, they&#39;ve got tubs big enough for you,&quot; he laughed as he pointed at the extra-large tub for bigger breeds. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit being such a baby. Get undressed and I&#39;ll go find you some shampoo,&quot; Kai said. He was already off into the store before Spencer could say anything.<br />
<br />
Spencer stared at the large tub with higher walls and a shower handle. It really was a perfect size for him. The head of the shower might have been a bit low, but with it being a hand-held he could just lift it a bit higher. Looking back into the store, Spencer couldn&#39;t help but notice that no one else was around. &quot;What the hell...&quot; he muttered as he started to take off his shirt. A cold breeze ran across him, making him shiver. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t stop as he dropped his shorts and underwear with it. Then turned on the water to let it warm up. &quot;Found some!&quot; Kai came back with a smile on his face. &quot;O-la-la,&quot; he whistled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Spencer ordered as he snatched the shampoo bottle from the other guy. He was a bit surprised he didn&#39;t have the urge to cover up. Most of the time, Spencer was a bit embarrassed by his extra weight. He&#39;d often avoid pools because he felt like people were staring. But right now, he almost felt comfortable in it. &quot;Cinnamon?&quot; he growled as he looked at the bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t like cinnamon?&quot; Kai shrugged. Spencer felt his eyes roll again. &quot;Look. I&#39;ll go find some clippers. You get the shower done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Spencer stepped into the tub and let the water hit him. It was a bit of a shock at first, but he quickly relaxed. He poured a bit of the shampoo into his hands and then ran it through his hair. &quot;Hmmm... This does smell good...&quot; he muttered as he continued to massage it into his scalp. It dripped down his face, leaving a trial of black and brown hair in its wake. With how good it smelled, Spencer figured he might as well use it as a body wash as well and pour a bit more on his hand.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his hands together and then started to rub the suds over his body. It was incredibly relaxing as the sweet-smelling liquid filled the air. He almost felt like he was in a full body massage. Though, he didn&#39;t notice the black and brown fur that was starting to overtake his skin. It was rapidly filling in every bit of his body. Brown fur grew around his mouth, on his belly, chest, hands and feet, while black fur filled out every other part of his body.<br />
<br />
Spencer scratched at it subconsciously not noticing his nails starting to grow longer and rounder. They quickly turned black. He barely noticed as the massage to his muscles felt just too damn good. Every bit of his body felt like it was going through a full body massage. His lack of muscle was rapidly changing as his hefty body turned into a more bulky frame. Heavy muscle started to grow underneath his fat. He let out a deep moan as his hand ran against his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; his nails scratched against the glass window on his small room. His cock throbbed. Never in Spencer&#39;s life had he thought about jerking it in public. Technically the thought never came up as he was slowly running his thicker fingers over his cock. He didn&#39;t even notice as small little paw pads emerged on each of his fingers. The strange callouses only made the sensation all the better.<br />
<br />
As he stroked, his mind went blank. He could only feel the urge to keep going. And that urge only distracted him as the bones in his feet started to shift. The whole foot lengthened and then his weight shifted only onto the balls of his feet rather than his whole foot. He lost his balance and fell into one of the walls. That didn&#39;t matter. As long as his hand kept running up and down his cock, Spencer was fully satisfied.<br />
<br />
His tongue lolled out of his mouth. Far longer than any human one. Not that that mattered as his nose and mouth started to extend outward and cover it back it. His nose turned wet and black. Sharp teeth filled his small snout. He continued to pant as a heat rose up deep inside him. The tops of his ears grew longer and longer until they finally folded over into floppy ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; he moaned as one final stroke sent him fully over. His body lurched as his human seed evacuated his body. For a few minutes Spencer let the water run over his body as he stood there in bliss. He turned off the water and looked down at himself. &quot;Huh?&quot; Using the window as a mirror, Spencer could see a rottweiler&#39;s face looking back at him. &quot;What the hell?&quot; but his paws moved whenever the reflections moved. He didn&#39;t understand how he had so much black and brown fur covering his body. The only thing keeping him calm was the overwhelming smell of cinnamon wafting from his body.<br />
<br />
Kai came running back with some sheers. &quot;Hey bud. I don&#39;t know how you let your coat get so long,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Good thing I&#39;m here to help tidy you up.&quot;</p>
