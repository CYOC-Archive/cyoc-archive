<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria hesitated a moment, unsure if she was only going to make things awkward between herself and the desk clerk. But Gloria was a woman that knew what she wanted, and she certainly couldn&#39;t deny her attraction to the petite blonde girl who certainly seemed to be reciprocating the attraction.<br />
<br />
“So..Amy..is it too forward of me to ask if you&#39;d like to join me for dinner? Dining with someone is always preferable to dining alone.” It was a safe way to find out if she was game. There were plenty of excuses the girl could make – previous plans, company policy, et cetera – that wouldn&#39;t be too confrontational, if she wasn&#39;t interested. <br />
<br />
Amy smiled and blushed again, this time a bit more strongly. “I..uhh..yeah,” she replied, toying nervously with her hair. “I get off of work in about a half hour. I&#39;d be happy to join you.”<br />
<br />
“Awesome,” Gloria replied. “So..six, then? Meet up at my room, and then we&#39;ll figure out where to go?”<br />
<br />
Amy nodded rather eagerly. “Yeah, that sounds good to me,” she replied with a cheerful grin. Gloria couldn&#39;t help but notice the way Amy was now looking her up and down. She was trying to be subtle about it, it appeared, but Gloria caught her eyes lingering and smiled back with a slightly raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll be waiting. In the meantime,” she told Amy, “Why don&#39;t you think about what you want for dinner...” she ran a finger down the V of her sundress, and then along the contour of the concealed portion of her right breast, brushing her nipple just enough to get it hard and poking at the soft cotton. “Or for desert..”<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes widened and she stammered. “I..I..yeah..I&#39;ll..mm..I&#39;ll do that,” she said nervously as she chewed her bottom lip and tried to hide how flustered she was, causing Gloria to wink and then turn back down the hall to the elevator. Gloria glanced back over her shoulder once and noticed Amy still at the counter, watching her closely with a look of hunger on her face, though she quickly pretended to type at the keyboard of her computer when she got caught. As Gloria headed back to her room on the slow-moving elevator, she smiled and tried to ignore a certain amount of her wetness and once-again rising desire. Yes, this vacation had been EXACTLY what she&#39;d needed.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
(Amy&#39;s perspective.)<br />
<br />
Amy was both excited and terrified. It was always like this when a guest and she ended up having a tryst. Gloria would hardly be her first; it was one of the benefits of working at the resort. Virtually everyone that visited any of the wings had a sexual kink associated with their transformation, and the few that didn&#39;t usually STILL ended up being more liberally-minded toward the idea of a fling. Still, it was slightly unusual for her to be approached, at least so quickly. <br />
<br />
Once Gloria was in the elevator, Amy typed Gloria&#39;s  room number into the computer along with Amy&#39;s own personal pin number. The computer let out a soft beep, and the words “HIGH VALUE CLIENT” popped up on the screen. “CONTACT SUPERVISOR PRIOR TO OFF-HOUR INTERACTION.”<br />
Amy felt a knot in her stomach. She&#39;d heard that other employees had been pulled off of people flagged with this designation. Gloria was the first one she&#39;d encountered on her own, though she&#39;d been directed by higher ups a couple of times to help a girl “entertain” a man or woman (once it was a couple) who&#39;d been flagged, but it had never been more than one night. Rumors persisted that some of the employees had much longer-term relations with those clients, and that they were richly rewarded by both the resort and often the guests. She crossed her fingers as she dialed her supervisor&#39;s extension, a strict woman by the name of Clarice. Actually, strict was probably being kind. “Bitch” and “Ballbuster” were two of the more common terms she and the other girls on the staff said when she came up in conversation after work. She hoped she wouldn&#39;t be pulled off of Gloria-she was curious precisely what went on with these so called “high value clients”. None of the girls or guys she was friendly with ever admitted being on one of those assignments.<br />
<br />
The phone rang twice before being answered with a clipped, “Yes?”<br />
<br />
“Clarice, this is Amy. I work the desk in the animal wing and-”<br />
<br />
“I know who you are. What is it?” The voice cut her off, sounding both irritated and authoritative.<br />
<br />
“I was approached by a guest for some..interaction later. When I did the standard check on her, it was flagged high value,” Amy said, deciding that brevity was best.<br />
<br />
“Name and Room?” the voice said, seemingly less harsh, though Amy knew not to read much into that. Clarice was known for never betraying anything in terms of true intention or opinion until it was far too late for an employee to prevent termination.<br />
<br />
“Gloria Cardon, Room 1152,” Amy replied helpfully. She could hear typing on Clarice&#39;s keyboard even over the phone. The woman banged the keys quite forcefully, probably just as much a sign of her dominating personality as anything she said or did.<br />
<br />
“And she made the request of YOU?” the voice seemed surprised, but not overly so. The question seemed a confirmation.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“You are permitted at this time to continue interaction with her. Her last nanite readings show heightened arousal, and her history shows at least two self-initiated climaxes. You will follow our guidance on this. Do you understand?” The clipped voice sounded almost analytical, and Amy wondered just how much information the nanites relayed. More importantly, why didn&#39;t AMY know about this?<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma&#39;am,” Amy did what she could to hide her confusion and uncertainty. This wasn&#39;t something she was willing to just throw away by seeming to be a foolish girl who didn&#39;t know how to do her job.<br />
<br />
“She seems quite amenable to sexual relations with you, or at least pliable, given these readings.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, she is, ma&#39;am. Trust me,” Amy said confidently.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Clarice responded, seeming almost pleased with the response. “You will initiate sex shortly after joining her. You will also continue to encourage her to transform throughout the evening, and you will encourage her to feed the animal side of herself. We need to know her hunting and animal reflex. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“I do. I doubt that will be a problem. She has that air about herself.,” Amy added.<br />
“Good girl,” Clarice said, and Amy smiled to herself that she&#39;d somehow gotten the approval of Clarice.<br />
<br />
“But..sex right away,” Amy asked. “What if she just wants to get to know me first? Isn&#39;t that a little awkward?”<br />
<br />
There was silence on the other end of the line. Then finally a response. “Let us worry about that. Go to your quarters and get dressed...appropriately. Bring along at least two changes of clothing.”<br />
<br />
“Yes ma&#39;am,” Amy said before hanging up the phone. As she headed out of the building and caught the tram to the employee quarters,  Amy&#39;s mind continued to ponder the cryptic meaning of that last statement, and for the first time since she&#39;d started working here, she found herself wondering if there wasn&#39;t something darker underneath the surface.</p>
