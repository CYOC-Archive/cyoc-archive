<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are Rick, a fifteen year old boy. You have five close friends that are at the carnival with. They are Danny, Ron, Jack, Jen, and Sam.<br />
<br />
Danny is sixteen and very athletic. He's five foot eight and weighs one hundred forty pounds. He's the second string quarterback though there is talk that he will be starting quarterback next season. He isn't your typical jock though. He's smart and is very friendly. This makes him an outcast with both the jock and smart cliques.<br />
<br />
Ron is fifteen and pretty much a geek. He loves to play D&amp;D and is usually a female elf. He has to wear thick glasses since his vision is so bad. Because of this he gets picked on quite a bit. One day when the jocks had taken his glasses Danny had stepped in and retrieved his glasses. Since then they have been friends. Ron is five foot nine and weighs ninety pounds.<br />
<br />
Jack is sixteen and comes from a military family. He has no interest in joining the military however. He's a conspiracy buff and thus doesn't really trust the government. He's determined to investigate all the conspiracy theories and prove them true or false once and for all. His investigative skills had saved Danny from being kicked off the football team when he had been accused of cheating on a test. Jack is five foot seven and weighs one hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
Jen is sixteen and a cheerleader. She is pretty smart and very outgoing. She had gotten the reputation of being the school hoe even though she has never had sex. She had gone out with Danny but after a couple of dates they had agreed that it wasn't going to work out at this time. They remained friends however and they might try the boyfriend/girlfriend route later. She prefers to wear jeans and loose fitting shirts when she isn't cheer leading. She's five foot and<br />
weighs one hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
Sam is fifteen and is a hermaphrodite. She is just about the complete opposite of Jen. She's just as smart as Jen but she is rather shy. She prefers to wear skirts and tight fitting shirts. The whole school knows that she has a dick and as such hasn't had any boyfriends except for you. She can function sexually as both a male and female. Whether she can get pregnant or get someone else pregnant is still unknown. She does have a period like every other girl so she should be able to get pregnant. She likes to spend her time reading books. She likes romance and fantasy novels. She and Jen are lab partners. She is five foot four and weighs one hundred<br />
ten pounds.<br />
<br />
Of course the last member of your little clique is you. You are relatively smart and are into the paranormal. You also like to read fantasy novels. It was at a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore that you discovered that Sam also likes fantasy novels. Both of you were after the same book but they only had one left. There was another book that you both wanted so you decided that you would buy one and she would buy the other. You would then borrow the other's book when they were finished. After a few days you started to go over to her<br />
house to read and chat. Your relationship developed from there. When her parents first found out that you two were becoming boyfriend/girlfriend they were overjoyed. They didn't think that Sam would find someone until well after high school. You two have had sex. Sam's dick doesn't seem to bother you. In fact you have sucked her off while she sucked you off. You have even allowed her to take you anally. You are five foot six and weigh one hundred twenty<br />
pounds.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did the fortune teller say to you?&quot; Danny asked. &quot;What is your future like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she said that my life would become interesting&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
At this point Sam noticed the ring on my finger and said &quot;Ooooooooh, she gave you a ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; I said. &quot;She called it the Ring of Truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean you can only speak the truth?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said that the ring would change reality to make whatever I say true&quot; I said. &quot;She did say that it wouldn't work if I was asked a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's good&quot; Ron said. &quot;You don't want to alter anything accidentally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Jack said. &quot;You could have the South winning the Civil War instead of the North if you answered wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
We all laughed at this and then Sam asked &quot;Do you really think that that ring can do what that fortune teller said?&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about it for a minute. It seemed to absurd on the surface but maybe it was possible. The tent that the fortune teller was in had vanished after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Jen asked when I didn't respond right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that it is possible&quot; I said. &quot;The fortune teller's tent did disappear after I left it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do something with it&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait&quot; Danny said. &quot;Will you still have your memories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure&quot; I said. &quot;The fortune teller never said if I would or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you might want to make sure that you do keep your memories&quot; Jack said. &quot;You wouldn't want to lose yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good idea&quot; I said. I chose my next words carefully. &quot;I keep all of my memories whenever reality changes as well as gain new memories to fit the new reality. The same thing goes for you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for including us&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; I said. &quot;You guys are my friends and I figured you should see whatever changes I make. Now I just need to figure out what I want to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a suggestion&quot; Sam said seductively as she leaned close to me. &quot;You've sucked my dick and even let me fuck you in the ass. Wouldn't you like to experience sex as a girl? You could become a hermaphrodite like me if you want to keep your dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good idea&quot; I said. &quot;But I think that I should start small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then have Jen wearing her cheerleader uniform&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I'm not cheer leading right now!&quot; Jen said. &quot;You know that I hate wearing skirts unless I'm cheer leading.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which will make it a good test&quot; Danny said. &quot;Besides it will only be for a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as long as Rick changes my clothes back immediately after I guess he can do it&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping that you'd say that&quot; Danny said. &quot;Go ahead Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Jen, you are wearing your cheerleader uniform&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Immediately Jen's clothes changed into her cheerleader uniform. Her pants changed to her red and white pleated skirt, her tee shirt changed to her red and white sleeveless top, her shoes changed to her white soft soled shoes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I could remember Jen coming to the carnival wearing her cheerleader uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it worked&quot; Jen said. &quot;I even remember putting this on before coming. I thought that I'd see if I could shake you guys up a bit. Now please change my clothes back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Jen, you're wearing what you were before I changed your clothes&quot; I said. I figured I should add that last part since the ring might interpret it as what she was wearing before she put on her cheerleader uniform on in this reality. That could mean that she would be naked and I don't think she would have been happy with me if that happened.<br />
<br />
After Jen's clothes changed back she said &quot;Well that ring certainly can alter reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good thing that you added the part about her clothes being what she wore before you changed them&quot; Sam said. &quot;Otherwise she might be naked now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought about that possibility&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would that have happened?&quot; Jack asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it was a different reality&quot; Ron said. &quot;Jen could have been wearing nothing before she put on her uniform in that reality. The ring probably would have changed Jen's clothes based on that reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have ended up naked&quot; Jen said. &quot;I had taken a shower before getting ready to come out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least it would have been an accident if that had happened&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still wouldn't have been happy&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we know that the ring works&quot; Ron said. &quot;Things could get very interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I know what I want&quot; Sam said seductively as she ran her finger down my cheek.<br />
<br />
I smiled at Sam and said &quot;I'm a hermaphrodite like Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again the transformation happened immediately. I lost a couple inches in height, my whole body slimmed down to a more feminine shape, my hips widened while my waist narrowed, my hair grew down to just past my shoulders, my chest expanded out to b cup breasts, I felt new tissue form between my legs and inside me.<br />
<br />
Once my physical transformation was done my clothes changed. My pants became a denim mini skirt. My briefs changed into panties and a bra formed around my chest and breasts. My shirt became a tight tee shirt. My shoes became sandals. My socks disappeared, and a purse appeared hanging from my shoulder.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I had a sense of vertigo as new memories flooded my mind. I remembered being teased by both the boys and girls for having a dick. One girl had suggested that I get my dick removed. When I had told my parents about it they had told me that they wouldn't do that. They said that I was born this way for a reason. They loved me for who I was. Though I was alone until Sam had moved here two years ago. We became friends rather quickly because of the common bond we had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok that was weird&quot; Jen said. &quot;I've now known you for the past two years instead of the past year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try having a whole life of new memories flood into your mind&quot; I said my voice now a feminine pitch. &quot;That's weird and disorienting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least our sex is good&quot; Sam said. &quot;I like putting my dick into your pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same goes for me too&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Allison, who will you change next?&quot; Danny asked.<br />
<br />
That was a good question. Who would I change next?</p>
