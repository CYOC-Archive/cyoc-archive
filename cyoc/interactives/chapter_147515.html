<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff considered the options at his disposal and nodded resolutely. Although it was likely too good for the asshole gone dildo in his hand, he would set it up in the girls locker room. This wasn&#39;t really for Randal, it was for Jeff to get an eyeful of the variety the school had to offer. Maybe he&#39;d even get lucky and his crush would be changing while he waited. Once again an unwarranted rise of his member brought him back to the task at hand, hopefully giving this dildo off to a worst case scenario. That was all one could hope for, he&#39;d also considered that he&#39;d forgotten to erase the bully from existence. Likely no one would even care that he was gone and might even be glad for it. If it came down to it, he would go ahead and do the deed but for now, nah. <br />
<br />
Jeff made his way toward the girls locker room with plans on how to sneak it in and yet stick around. The classic idea of hiding in a locker would likely get him caught. Invisibility maybe? That seemed like a hit or miss depending if the Chronivac could do it. He could erase himself from people&#39;s attentions or become an object himself... However, if he got separated from the Chronivac, he&#39;d be shit out of luck. That last option came to him and maybe could be the best. How would you hide a tree? With a Forest... So to hide in the girls locker room, Jeff would be a girl or at least look like one. The issue there would be that a new girl would be subject to questions and possibly even more attention, so he&#39;d have to be someone no one would think of and yet there couldn&#39;t be two of them. All of this was causing Jeff so much of a headache that he didn&#39;t notice that girl in front of him knocking them both to the ground.<br />
<br />
Alice Markson was an average girl all around except maybe her cocoa complexion. Otherwise, her body was just that average in height, hair style, color, even cup size wasn&#39;t much to squeeze at which Jeff had just discovered through her sweater. Once the two of them had fully come to grasp the situation, it was Alice who reacted first starting to shout. Jeff tried to shush her to no avail, he had no choice then as doors began to open in the hall. Jeff reopened the Kiri app cycling to menu, only briefly glimpsing the still splayed form of Kelly. Time was running short as the app scanned Alice&#39;s form and heads just started to peak out. Using the same slider he&#39;d found earlier, he slid it almost to the end and instantly Alice seemed to vanish leaving only her clothing and a tiny squeak. At least he hadn&#39;t shrunk her into oblivion by accident, he flipped over almost laid out on the pile of items when the first faces appeared. He&#39;d only get one shot at this...<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;I saw the girl that screamed, I tried to help her but, Randal just shoved me out of the way and chased her.&quot; <br />
<br />
He almost sweat bullets with how badly the excuse sounded to him. Sure enough though, Randal&#39;s reputation preceded him and a couple teachers ran down the hall while the others ushered curious onlookers back into their rooms. Jeff stood up gathering the entire pile and heading off for the nearest restroom. He locked himself in the biggest stall and laid the pile gently on the floor, it wouldn&#39;t do to crush the tiny Alice. Searching through the pile, he of course found the form of Randal first. The first good thing to ever come out of your life I&#39;m betting, thinking back to the hallway incident just prior. He kept searching and finally found Alice encapsulated in her animal print panties. He gawked momentarily both at the panties for her age and the less than an inch tall Alice. <br />
<br />
Jeff picked her out of her panties with great care concerning her size setting her atop the pile. He did try to make out the details of her nude frame but, with her size the finer details were lost. She did her best to cover the goods as it were anyway, even considering the bewildered look on her face. While she covered and considered herself, Jeff looked at the Chronivac&#39;s statistics of her. <br />
<br />
Name: Alice<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 17<br />
Hair:  Blonde<br />
Height: 2 centimeters<br />
Weight: .3 ounces<br />
Bust: B<br />
Waist: .3 centimeters<br />
Gluteus: .4 centimeters. <br />
<br />
Jeff had really begun to hate the statistics after shrinking, way to much to figure on. Jeff looked at her tiny form once more and spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;I&#39;m going to fix you real quick, just down scream anymore when I do...&quot;<br />
<br />
He waited for a moment before the agreement slowly came after. He adjusted the slider back to approximately how tall he&#39;d thought she had been. Once her size was roughly human again she began to take stock of her surroundings. While she was sitting quietly Jeff once again reviewed the statistics.<br />
<br />
Name: Alice<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 17<br />
Hair: Blonde<br />
Height: 5&#39;3&quot;<br />
Weight: 143 lbs<br />
Bust: B<br />
Waist: 27 inches<br />
Gluteus: 29 inches<br />
<br />
Now Jeff could see everything she had been covering with her guard down. He wasn&#39;t surprised to say the least that she lived up to her title of average. Alice had caught Jeff&#39;s leering, once more covering herself and when he&#39;d looked back at his phone, took her chance to scream again. Jeff, who&#39;d been figuring out what to do with her now heard her scream begin and scrambled to put anything in quickly lest he be caught like this. Instantly, her scream cut short as quickly as it began, before Jeff laid an incredibly lifelike replica of Alice. Even as he reached out to touch it, it indeed even felt real. No longer at threat at being caught Jeff checked his phone.<br />

<br />
Jeff had simply typed in the word &quot;Doll&quot; and the Chronivac must&#39;ve based the rest off of previous entries. So now here he sat with an odd trio of once people. An AI, formerly his sister, A dildo, formerly his bully, and a hyper-realistic doll of a girl with poorer luck in life than he had. He did feel a slight pang of guilt about it being permanent but, on the other hand nothing could be done about it now. Though the word &quot;Limited&quot; stood out in the statistics, Jeff leaned toward the doll. Couldn&#39;t be the same... Could it? He thought to himself as he brushed her clit with his finger. The movement didn&#39;t come with the same reaction at his toy at home but sure enough, the lips quivered and did the ones above. Considering everyone was in class, a little test wouldn&#39;t hurt would it? Standing firmly on cue and as if edging to the affirmative, his dick was firm. <br />
<br />
He unzipped his pants letting his dick find its way out as he positioned himself over the new doll. He decided to start with the mouth to get the experience of a blowjob and a little extra lubrication. Grabbing hold of the back doll&#39;s head, he kneeled settling his dick in the doll&#39;s mouth with closed around it. Carefully, he started thrusting back and forth, the tongue to his surprise moved along the shaft working the tip when able. Having already been primed since the play with his ex-sister early, he came in the mouth of the doll in short order. He pulled his wet dick out leaving the semen to dribble out on to the doll&#39;s breasts as he thrust into it&#39;s vagina.<br />
<br />
Unlike his toy at home, this vagina clamped onto his member so firmly that it hurt just a little. Still he pressed on thrusting slowly working into a rhythm as he fondled the semen covered breasts. The nipples stood firm on the easily palmed breasts, that held a charm of its own he supposed. He kept easing his successive thrusts to be faster getting used to the tightness. In the back of his mind he&#39;d wished that the doll have been able to move more on its own but, he&#39;d make it work. Though, the idea that she was in there an fully aware was alluring enough to satisfy him. His hastened thrusting was rewarded by some convulsing around his cock eluding to the ensuing climax. The doll&#39;s fluids oozed out over his balls as he buried himself deep inside. A few more deep thrusts and he pulls himself out leaving a trail of semen mingling with the rest of the flow. <br />
<br />
Jeff settled back on the clothing still laid out on the floor. He took in the full view of the various fluids dribbling out of the orifices he&#39;d just used. He wondered periodically how Alice was holding in there but, recalled his original plot for the day. Looking back to the violet dildo sitting on the floor, Jeff revisited his ideas to get it into the girls&#39; locker room. As if a lightbulb flashed in his mind he turned his eyes once again back to Alice. He had a way in after all and it was practically staring him in the face.</p>
