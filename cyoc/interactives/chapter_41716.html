<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Before Paul could light the cigarette, while facing away from the blinding sunset, he heard a familiar voice call out to him.</Br>
<Br>"Hey buddy! You dropped your keys!"</Br>
<Br>Paul stopped short in his tracks, held his drunken head low and sighed. Turning around Paul saw the buff, hairy, bear of a bartender jingling Paul's keys.</Br>
<Br>"Oh thank you sir! I would have been screwed when I got back home without them."</Br>
<Br>"You are welcome, but please don't call me sir. My name is Mark."</Br>
<Br>"Can do Mark... my name is Paul by the way."</Br>
<Br>"Nice to know you Paul. So what are you going to do for the night? Do you have a place to stay?"</Br>
<Br>"You know, I don't and I don't have any clue where I am going to go since it is so late. Heck, the sun is almost set and the moon is poised to rise."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I can see that. Well... why don't you stay with me for the night and then you can go about your business as usual tomorrow."</Br>
<Br>"Really... you would do that for some guy you don't even know?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, besides... I am off for the night and I was headed to be alone in my home. I would definitely welcome the company that you would bring. Also, I think you will need someone like me for what is coming tonight."</Br>
<Br>"What do you mean?"</Br>
<Br>"That drink you had, I had it several years ago before I started working here full-time and let me tell you, when the liquor really kicks in, it would have been nice to have someone to be around to help even with the smaller things."</Br>
<Br>"So you are telling me that this stuff has yet to kick my ass fully?"</Br>
<Br>"That is exactly what I am telling you. The thing is, it is most potent when the moon is full... which is tonight and it is going to be above the horizon pretty quick. It is a good thing that my house is just a couple doors down and we will have plenty of time to get you situated."</Br>
<Br>Mark extended his arm, having ushering Paul onward and within a few minutes, Mark stood at the front door. The door opened to a semi-wide hallway with a long staircase. Mark had Paul go up first, so that Mark could be behind to catch Paul if he fell backward in his drunkenness. Once the two got to the top of the stairs, Mark unlocked the door to his home which was immediately in front of the two at the top of the stairs. When Mark opened the door for Paul, Mark could feel the changes start to happen to him and could see that they were also happening to Paul. Paul stepped into the bachelor style apartment loft and when Mark was directly behind him, Mark closed and locked the only exit.</Br>
<Br>"Well... what do you think about my place?" Mark asked with a large and toothy smile.</Br>
<Br>"I think it is really great!" Paul replied while noticing more about Mark than he had earlier.</Br>
<Br>Mark's body was definitely bigger, broader, more muscular and furrier. Paul also noticed that Mark's K-9s were longer, more prominent and fang like. Not wanting to be rude or stare, Paul moved over to the ceiling to floor windows and watched the nighttime sky. As Mark walked up to Paul, he could see that Paul's body grew thicker and more muscular, with his current clothes straining with Paul's new musculature. Walking directly up behind Paul, Mark's bulge pressed against his pants, which he set against Paul's left cheek. As he did that, Mark grabbed Paul's shoulders with his massive hands and began to massage the tense muscles.</Br>
<Br>Feeling Mark's hands on his newly sore muscles was welcoming, even wanted, but he also felt divided about the throbbing bulge he could feel lightly pressed against his posterior. The more Mark rubbed, the more Paul relaxed and when Mark could feel no tension, he stopped while just resting his hands on Paul's shoulders.</Br>
<Br>"You know Mark, that felt real good."</Br>
<Br>Mark smiled, squeezed tighter on his shoulders while pressing his rock hard bulge against Paul's butt. Paul smiled, not caring about anything at that moment, while being so relaxed.</Br>
<Br>"You know..." Paul said, but paused quickly as he looked to his left shoulder.</Br>
<Br>What Paul saw was startling, to say the least. Paul noticed that his own muscles were huge and tight against the once loose fitting fabric. The other thing, Paul saw that the hands on his shoulders weren't just hands anymore... they were paws with short and sharp black claws. Paul also noticed that Mark's paws were covered in a short dark auburn fur. Not sure if he wanted to turn around, Paul just stood there and tightened right back up.</Br>
<Br>Feeling his tenseness again, Mark squeezed tight, which only forced Paul to relax once more. Not sure of what was going on or what Paul's new problem may have been... Mark had an idea toward what it was and spun Paul to look him right in the face, er... muzzle.</Br>
<Br>"Wha... what are you?"</Br>
<Br>"I am a werewolf, just like you are going to be as soon as that moon comes up. I can already see the changes in you; the bigger muscles, the denser hair on the exposed portions of your skin."</Br>
<Br>"A... a werewolf? Like in Lon Chaney?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes a werewolf... what did you expect when you were drinking a 'Full moon-shine'? No, not like Lon Chaney, but like myself as you can see."</Br>
<Br>"I don't know, just didn't put two and two together." Then Paul's eyes widened as he felt a new attraction to the bartender, more so than when he was in the bar at first and when Mark offered him the room for the evening. "Yeah, I can definitely see! You must be very uncomfortable in those clothes, with your dark auburn fur poking through the areas that ripped."</Br>
<Br>"Heh, yeah... you do have a point there Paul. I usually get naked before I transform, but since I felt attracted to you sexually, I couldn't stop myself from transforming. I have left my clothes on because I didn't know how you would feel about seeing me naked."</Br>
<Br>"Well, you being naked is one thing and being a naked werewolf is another." Paul joked with a sly grin on his face.</Br>
<Br>"You do have a point, I guess I will start undressing and getting more comfortable."</Br>
<Br>As Mark started using his wolf paws to remove his clothes, Paul grabbed Mark's paws and stopped him. Feeling really turned on, Paul smiled wryly and Mark got the hint.</Br>
<Br>"Alright, I get the hint and look, the moon is up and it's shining bright tonight!"</Br>
<Br>As Paul looked at the light shining in the room from the moon, Paul began to feel even more different, while feeling sexier than he ever had and extremely horny. As Paul grabbed the base of Mark's red polo, he noticed that the black hair on the back of his hand was actually dark auburn like Mark's fur. Pulling up slightly, loosening the tucked in shirt from his pants, Paul caught a glimpse underneath. As Paul ran his hands up the six pack, fur covered abs, the shirt bunched at Paul's wrists while Paul continued exploring. Mark wanted to help, so he grabbed the rest of the shirt and pulled it off over his head. Paul gasped as he saw the large lats flare, his biceps tighten from the pull, which made Paul even hornier. When Mark lowered his massive arms to their natural position, Paul saw how large and bulky Mark's pectorals were. Using his hands to explore, Paul realized that his hands were no longer hands. Each of his fingers had bulked up, his fingernails lengthened slighty and turned black to match Mark's black claws. Paul smiled as he watched his new paws develop the same thick fur that covered Mark's hot body.</Br>
<Br>"Hey Paul, I am glad that you are so enthusiastic to explore my body, but why don't we wait for your transformation to finish to do any more. With your hands already changed, it wont be too much longer and everything else will be different."</Br>
<Br>Saddened, Paul knew that Mark was right, not to mention he was definitely more experienced in the werewolf transformation process. Paul took his paws away and took a few steps back. </Br>
<Br>Paul was sure that the look on Mark's face was a smile, but from what, Paul wasn't really sure.</Br>
<Br>"Hey, can we go to the bathroom so I can watch the changes that are happening to me?" Paul asked in his new, gutteral sounding voice.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, sure... follow me."</Br>
<Br>As Mark padded into the bathroom on the dark, hard wooden floor, Paul smiled from what he saw and how he felt. Paul could see that Mark's hind paws and claws made short work of his work boots, as they stuck out through the shredded fabric. Paul could also see Mark's tight, small butt through his tight jeans, not to mention what Paul thought was a huge sack.</Br>
<Br>Once Paul was in the bathroom and he could process his reflection, he could see that he already sported a dark and thick 5 o'clock shadow. Paul just stands there, in front of the large wall width mirror, watching as his new changes slowly develop. Where Paul was once skinny and hairless, Paul now had huge muscles and a six pack of abs covered in the same thick, dark auburn fur that spread from his paws, up his arms to his shoulders, now traveled down his huge pecs and into every ridge of his abs.</Br>
<Br>Paul started to moan, almost sexually, and braced himself as he felt the next transformation start to occur. Paul felt tension build up in his feet, which changed into paws and when the claws formed, he felt the tension release from his new wolven toes bursting through his white and red trimmed Nikes. Bracing himself against the counter, squeezing his padded fingers against the granite counter-top, Paul watched as his face pushed out into a muzzle while his eyes changed from his sensual blue to a brilliant amber and forest green. His ears grew pointed and migrated to the upper sides of his new skull. Paul smiled broadly with his new muzzle, revealing his toothy mouth that changed. Not to mention his bi-cuspids lengthened and were more prominent as fangs.</Br>
<Br>As the transformation paused for a second, Paul turned to Mark to speak. "You know... this is really strange, but holy shit does this feel good!"</Br>
<Br>Mark growled lowly and short. "What next is going to feel even better then! Not to mention, if you want to, I can help you feel even better!"</Br>
<Br>Paul growled in return, definitely thinking that being at Mark's pad was better than things happening to him alone. Paul had no idea that this was going to happen, not to mention how it would make him feel, especially in the sex department. Paul braced himself again, feeling a pain come from both his groin and his butt. Mark realized where Paul was and ripped a large hole in his pants at the seam of his pants. Suddenly, the pain was released as his large, fluffy wolven tail grew just above his tail-hole. As the pain continued in his crotch, it went from being a bad pain to one that felt incredibly erotic. Paul could feel his cock stir to life, growing to where he thought was normal, but then things became much tighter until his bulge popped the zipper apart and Paul's underwear contained bulge showed otherwise. A great amount of happiness swelled within his heart and he just stared at the newly transformed self.</Br>
<Br>Mark growled sexily when he looked at Paul. "So Paul, how do you feel?"</Br>
<Br>"I feel great, but I am extremely constricted in these clothes for humans."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I know how you feel. Why don't the two of us get more comfortable."</Br>
<Br>Mark turned and walked up to Paul. Mark grabbed Paul's shirt and removed it. Looking at Paul and Paul looking at himself, they both started drooling over the new body.</Br>
<Br>"Man Paul, you are so hot!"</Br>
<Br>"You are too Mark!"</Br>
<Br>Paul, wanting to pay Mark for his hospitality, went back to what he started earlier. Paul placed his paws on the waist band of Mark's pants and unbuttoned the waist. Like a rocket, the zipper pulled itself apart and Mark's bulge got a bit more relief. Getting on his knees, placing his muzzle at Mark's crotch, Paul slid the tight pants down and off. Mark, using his claws, made short work of what was left of the clothes and freed himself. Paul nuzzled up against the thick and average length cock that was spewing pre and causing a large wet spot to form. Taking in a huge whiff, Paul could smell the spunk and he wanted a taste. Opening his muzzle, he pushed himself over the fabric covered cock and took every bit of the pre soaked undies he could, then sucked drawing out the pre.</Br>
<Br>Enjoying what Paul just did to him, Mark gushed out another thick bead of pre and Paul repeated his actions. Wanting the cock to himself, Paul pulled the undies off and down, revealing the seven inch beer bottle thick cock, spewing lots of tasty pre. Paul was happy to know that his cock would be human in shape like Mark's. As another drop started to bead on the tip, Paul dove in and sucked on Mark's cock. Slowly and methodically bobbing, making sure to pleasure Mark as best as he could, Paul worked over Mark's cock. Slowly, Paul built up a load and when Mark could no longer hold back, the flood gates opened and his huge grapefruit balls dumped it's seed down into Paul's hungry stomach.</Br>
<Br>As Paul pulled off Mark, Mark shot another smaller amount of cum onto Paul's muzzle. Just when Paul was going to lick it off, Mark moved in and licked off his own handiwork.</Br>
<Br>"Paul, that was wonderful... but now it is my turn."</Br>
<Br>Just like Paul did, Mark did all of the work getting Paul's clothes off and revealing Paul's cock. To Paul's amazement, his cock was seven inches long and slightly thicker than Mark's tasty cock. Just like Mark, pre was just pouring from the tip of his cock, which Paul was happy with both the results. Paul was very happy that that much pre was coming out of him when he barely made any before he got off when he was just a human, not to mention he had a baby dick which all of the guys at the gym would have made fun of him for when he decided to shower there.</Br>
<Br>As Mark slowly and methodically worked on Paul's cock, he could feel a large load building in his balls and yet when he would have came already, it was still building. After about fifteen minutes of Mark's handiwork, Paul climaxed down his partner's hungry muzzle. When Mark was done draining Paul dry, Mark got back to his wolven hind paws and kissed Paul while depositing Paul's own sweet and tasty cum on Paul's tongue. Tasting his own spunk, Paul knew that his was slightly sweeter than Mark's load.</Br>
<Br>"You know Paul, I think I just swallowed half a gallon of cum from you. Wolf, when you cum, you cum big! I definitely need to keep you around."</Br>
<Br>While they both chuckled, Paul and Mark moved into the living room to talk and decide what each of them wanted.</Br></p>
