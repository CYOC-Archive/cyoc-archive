<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Terry? Is Terry in here?” yelled a voice from somewhere in the crowed of merpeople. <br />
<br />
Terry looked around not sure who was speaking, there where so many people stuffed into the transport tank, he couldn’t be sure who was searching for him or even if it was him. Terry wasn’t that uncommon of a name. <br />
<br />
Then the person called again and added his last name, so whoever was out there was looking for him. That caused a debate, should he answer, did he want to know who was calling and did he want them to see what he had become.<br />
<br />
“Right over here, this mermaid right here.” Stated Jack as she pointed toward Terry, who turned and looked at her, not sure how to answer but more then temped to slap her across that new mermaid face of hers.<br />
<br />
He never got a chance and suddenly he was wrapped up in multiple arms and he was pulled close into a mound of flesh. <br />
<br />
“Terry…Terry I can’t believe I found you.” Said the women’s voice as Terry struggled against the arms, two arms were holding his head to the body while his tail was wrapped up in something. He pushed against whoever was holding him before finally the person realized he wanted to get away and let him go somewhat. <br />
<br />
Terry was still being held by the shoulders, but he at least could see who was holding him.<br />
<br />
It was a rather beautiful woman in her late 30s early 40s, her hair was a bright orange cut in a shorter style and her eyes where orange as well which was strange enough but the main feature which stood out on her top half was her massive breasts. <br />
<br />
Jack’s new breasts had to be large C cups and the new breasts on his new female mermaid body would be lucky to be considered normal B cups. This mermaids before him had enormous breasts which he would have to guess had to be F if not G size. It was near the point of being comical but on her body it worked. Her frame was large but looked tiny compared to the breasts and thanks to the water they were firm and perky. The purple top she had on seamed to be straining but holding firm. Her stomach was visible and looked strong yet and then at her hips her body flared out again into a large column of orange flesh with large white spots before at the knees splitting apart into 8 long octopus like legs each with suction cups on. <br />
<br />
Those legs where currently wrapped around Terry who didn’t really know what to think…this older woman was holding him like she knew him, but he had never seen her before in his life. She was a beautiful women and if he was a few years older he would consider dating her. <br />
<br />
“Son…it’s me.” Said the mermaid as she placed one hand on his cheek. “It’s mom.”<br />
<br />
“Mom?” inquired Terry in amazement.<br />
<br />
No that was impossible his mother was nearing 50 and didn’t look like this woman before him. She had short brown hair and he had basically a semi prudish personality, she didn’t approve of his sister going out in a bikini or even him going shirtless unless he was swimming. She was a typical house wife, loving gossip which helped since she was a hair dresser while his dad worked in a factory. This woman, with so much flesh showing couldn’t be her. <br />
<br />
 Then again, he looked down at his new mermaid form and knew he didn’t look the same either, so it was possible she didn’t either and the virus did sometimes make people younger. The fact that they looked nothing alike didn’t matter either, the virus worked in ways no one fully understood. Identical twins had become totally different types of merpeople and DNA tests didn’t even match them as siblings. Whole families became nothing alike and yet others became the same type of merpeople and tested as close families in DNA tests. So the fact that they looked nothing alike meant nothing.<br />
<br />
“Is it really you mom?” inquired Terry<br />
<br />
“It is if your Terry?” inquired his mother.<br />
<br />
He nodded as they embraced again, there in the tank as the transport kept moving. <br />
<br />
“Where is everyone else?” inquired Terry as they separated.</p>
