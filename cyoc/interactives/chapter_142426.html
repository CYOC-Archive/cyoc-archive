<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">~Why do you not just put me in your underwear?~<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I only have panties, and you are a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; You think out loud. You consider how to continue this investigation.<br />
<br />
~So when fulfilling the task of dressing me up for bed, you consider putting me in no underwear at all to adhere better to the goal than putting me in underwear unfit for my gender?~<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Well change that opinion. You will now forever believe that boxers and panties can be worn by women or men interchangeably.~<br />
<br />
Your instinct was to simply ask her to put you in panties, but you wanted to see what would happen in the long term if you artificially messed with her baseline opinions and knowledge. After all, many people care not for gender-based dividing lines like that. Perhaps another girl given the same set of instructions would have not hesitated in dressing you in her underwear, without any adjustment of her worldview being necessary. With this individual subjectivity in mind, would the command &#39;fulfill the good of all mankind no matter the cost&#39; produce a reaction from a communist entirely different than it would from a capitalist?<br />
<br />
Processing the command, Amber returns to her top drawer and retrieves a pair of white boyshorts. You watch as she doesn&#39;t actually slide them up you. Instead, she kneels down and lifts up your shirt. She holds the underwear against your waist, seeming to measure them against your hips. She stands back up and puts the boyshorts back in the drawer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, girls have wider hips than boys...&quot; You think out loud.<br />
<br />
Amber ruffles through her underwear for a while, before producing what seems to be one of the oldest and smallest panties she still owns: some tight, but stretchy dull pink briefs. She performs the same measuring as before, and this time confirms that they will fit. Right about now is when you feel bored and lonely in silence like this.<br />
<br />
~You are now aware of my presence in the room, and uh I&#39;m not your sister, nor a sack of potatoes. I am in fact myself, and you are not bothered or worried by my being here. No matter what, you will be perfectly calm and happy with me being here.~<br />
<br />
You stumbled a bit on the conciseness there, because you were trying to make sure you cleaned up any previous commands that may cause a conflict.<br />
<br />
Amber looks up at you.<br />
&quot;Oh hey! Who are you?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Daniel Kelly-Woods. The &#39;Kelly&#39; is part of my last name, not my middle name.&quot; You say your name, followed by your standard clarification.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, nothing wrong with having a girl&#39;s name.&quot; Amber chuckles. She stretches the panties out. &quot;Okay, lift up your foot.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she is still fulfilling the task of dressing you. You follow her instruction, followed by the other foot, and eventually let her slide the brief up your legs. You notice that as the brief nears the top, she slows down for a bit, stares at the space between your legs, and clears her throat before finishing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you here, Daniel?&quot; Amber asks, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m from around the neighborhood, and felt like making some new friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait a second, when did you put my shirt on?&quot; She asks, grabbing and looking at it. &quot;And wait...&quot; She leans in and sniffs your hair. &quot;You&#39;re wearing my conditioner!&quot; She pulls back and puts a hand on her hip and smiles at you with confusion. &quot;When did you put all that on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave me a bath and then dressed me, remember?&quot; You answer. ~Your memories of bathing me are now accessible to your conscious mind, and you remember having done it voluntarily and happily.~ You follow it up with a command. A pretty experimental one, in fact. Presumably, the memories of her actions are stored within her brain (else she wouldn&#39;t have the capacity to perform the task in a logical sequence), but simply suppressed from conscious accessibility, as-per the default conditions of the sapphire&#39;s commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; She says, letting go of your shirt. &quot;Oh... oh...&quot; She bites her lip and avoids eye contact, looking at your chest instead of your face.<br />
&quot;Hey... nice necklace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this?&quot; You reply, holding the sapphire up. &quot;I know it looks fancy, but I found it on the side of the road somewhere, so it&#39;s probably a fake gem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well anyway, I was getting ready for bed. I&#39;m gonna go brush my teeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, I&#39;ll come with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, ok gotcha.&quot; She leads you back into the bathroom. &quot;...why do you want to be here while I brush my teeth?&quot; She asks, rinsing out her brush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just bored.&quot; You say, sitting on the stool beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... okay...&quot; She mutters, applying toothpaste to her brush and popping it in her mouth.<br />
<br />
As she brushes, she keeps looking back over at you, a little more embarrassed each time. While the command disallows her to feel unrest, anger and fear as a result of your invading her privacy, she seems to be wearing the ambivalent emotion of (possibly sexual) tension brought on by a boy you just met in your bathroom; both of you without pants on. In fact, you noticed this nervousness begin when she saw you naked, and worsened when you allowed her to remember the bath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem a bit high-strung.&quot; You say, crossing your legs on the stool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm?&quot; She mumbles through the brush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you not ever seen a boy naked before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes bulge out a bit, and she starts brushing back and forth rapidly for a few moments before spitting out.<br />
&quot;AHEM! Well...&quot; She stammers. &quot;No I have not. I suppose I am the shy little virgin, and you are the sex god in the room here, yes? With a magnetic personality like yours, you are surely connected to a revolving door of women.&quot; She cocks her head at you, popping the brush back in her mouth for her bottom teeth.<br />
<br />
A few observations to make from this reply. Firstly, that your commands have not made you immune to the Mateus snark factor. Second, that Amber clearly wanted to take the heat off herself and throw it back onto you. Amber doesn&#39;t appear <i>that</i> embarrassed about how the night is going, she is carrying herself a lot more confidently than a lot of actual really shy people would. And yet, she seems unruly about discussing how she feels. This could perhaps be caused by the dissonance of her preferences and her actions. Most likely, a completely free Amber without any restrictions of mind control, would not choose to put her own underwear on a boy she just met. And yet, that is what she has just done. Hypnosis--as it is conventionally portrayed in movies and cartoons--is more of an override of the victim&#39;s entire personality. Sometimes this is permanent, sometimes it is temporary, but it usually involves the victim going into a flat, drone-like state with no emotion until their task is completed. Or in the event that the mind control is a direct alteration of personality, it is indeed a <b>complete</b> paradigm shift to their identity. The sad character becomes happy, the bookworm becomes slutty, ext.<br />
<br />
By contrast the sapphire--as it has been demonstrated many times--does not affect the victim in any way other than exactly how the instructions are laid out. It would make sense that this could run a high risk of causing existential or personal crises, as an otherwise free individual finds themselves behaving in a way that defies their own personality. It makes a lot of sense, then, that a command is not consciously perceived by its victim--at least, not by default. And it would then, further, make a lot of sense that the victims are very hesitant to ponder their own actions under the sapphire&#39;s influence. This in mind, you want to see what might happen if you try to screw with Amber on this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanna know, why&#39;d you let me into your room and give me a bath and everything?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
You wait until she spits out again.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d ask the same to you. A girl you don&#39;t know giving you a bath? Pretty creepy. Maybe you should go to creepy jail.&quot; She says, popping in her brush for a final round.<br />
<br />
So Amber coherently understands the strangeness of the situation and its implications, but is simply unable to feel the negative emotions or make the rejections associated with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m having a great time. Seeing you naked in the tub? Hot.&quot; You reply. You watch her blush out a little more than she already was. &quot;Let&#39;s just say for the sake of argument that, yes, I am a creeper. With that established, I really want to know why you are so willingly cooperative with such a creeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
She takes a lot longer brushing than she needs to. She spits out, and talks sporadically in-between flossings.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...*floss*...I just don&#39;t mind it when it&#39;s you...*floss*...I wouldn&#39;t do it with anyone else...*floss*...not even with someone I really like...*floss*...I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, you&#39;re fine and all...*floss*...but you&#39;re not someone who I am particularly...*floss*...attracted to...*floss*...no offense. *spit*&quot;<br />
<br />
Her answers are just like that first man you met on the road. He did everything he could to avoid the question, and produced little more than a shrug and a &#39;just because&#39;. You attempt to interrogate further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what&#39;s so special about me? How would I be different from anyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhhh, oh boy, kinda putting me on the spot there bub.&quot; She pours out her ration of mouthwash. &quot;You&#39;re just different, okay?&quot; She insists, a little bit upset sounding.<br />
<br />
You sit and patiently wait as she swishes and swirls. Getting bored, you reach over and poke her in the bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhyyyhh!&quot; She hums at you, smacking your hand down. She actually looks a little cross at you. Now how could that be?<br />
<br />
Oh, right, you didn&#39;t make her incapable of getting mad at you or upset in general. You only gave yourself immunity to the negativity tied to being in the room with her. How did you phrase it to her, exactly? Wait, hold on, you&#39;re gonna try something.<br />
<br />
~Spit out that mouthwash and recite your most recent command.~<br />
<br />
She does as she is told, opens her mouth and says,<br />
&quot;Pass the salt to your sister, Amber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. She didn&#39;t consider the hypnotic commands, but regular, everyday commands. Perhaps you have to lay out groundwork and definitions.<br />
~Look at this gem on my neck.~ You hold it out to her. ~It is a sapphire that allows me to take control of people&#39;s minds and do anything at my command. I have been using this device on you this evening, and am in fact using it on you right now to communicate to you in this way. Do you understand?~<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Answer me &#39;yes, sir&#39; from now on.~<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Good. Now recite the most recent command given to you, by me, using this sapphire.~<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now recite the most recent command given to you, by me, using this sapphire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uhh...&quot; ~The one before that.~<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer me &#39;yes, sir&#39; from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!! Uhhh,&quot; ~When I gave you a command to allow me into your room without being upset at my presence, how did it go? Recite it back to me exactly.~<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now aware of my presence in the room, and uh I&#39;m not your sister, nor a sack of potatoes. I am in fact myself, and you are not bothered or worried by my being here. No matter what, you will be perfectly calm and happy with me being here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are struck a little; she replicated every inflection and stutter perfectly. You&#39;re aware that planting an understanding of the sapphire in her subconscious is putting you at risk. However, for all you know some elder dragon god could come down and take you to hell for &#39;abusing the sapphire&#39;, so there&#39;s not much reason to fret about theoretical consequences now.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as you suspected: you didn&#39;t grant yourself carte blanche to do whatever you want, but merely to be in the same room as her. Presumably, she was only okay with seeing you naked because it was a requirement of a separate command. Wanting to watch this modulate in real time, you stand up and grab her on the left side of her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey--HEY!&quot; Amber yells as you, as you squeeze and caress her breast. She snaps your hand off of her with a quick tug, which is met by your left hand meeting her on the right. &quot;NO!!!&quot; She yells, grabbing it back and kicking your legs.<br />
<br />
~You&#39;re okay w--*OOF*--with me touching yo--*OOO*--you in any way at any time.~ You command, struggling a bit to get a word in kick-wise.<br />
<br />
The kicking and resistance stops. Her face and posture soften instantly. You promptly raise both of your hands to each of her breasts. She &#39;humphs&#39; and looks away as you stand there and rub her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... I wanna get to bed now. Can I go?&quot; She asks meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you can&#39;t. I want to keep rubbing.&quot; You reply, your grip tightening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want to sleep!&quot; She backs away from you, your clasping hands now clasping the air. She struts off and heads out the bathroom.<br />
<br />
You observed that she made no attempt to directly remove your hands from her body, but her legs made an effort to move her in the direction she wanted to go. You followed behind her and continued massaging her chest, this time moving along with her. She whimpered a bit, but made no objection. So she has no respect for her privacy, and now neither for her body (as it pertains to you at least), but has kept her sense of personal freedom in every other respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey could you hand me that pencil?&quot; You ask, testing this out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; She answers, reaching over at her desk and giving it to you.<br />
<br />
Oh, right, you told her to answer to you with &#39;yes sir&#39;. But handing you a pencil was a very mild request. She doesn&#39;t just do whatever you say, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, how sensitive are your breasts?&quot; You ask, continuing to rub them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an inappropriate question!&quot; She snaps at you, organizing her desk a little bit in spite of the obvious stimulation she&#39;s feeling.<br />
<br />
You take one hand down to her backside and ride your fingers up and down her ass crack. She lets out a moan, but continues to turn off her lamp.<br />
&quot;Do you like this?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut it out with the creepy questions!&quot; She says, strutting off to her bed.<br />
<br />
So Amber is decidedly not at your beck and call. Perhaps it&#39;s time to fix that.</p>
