<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as the boy realised you are back to your old self, by watching you feast on oats, he closed the door of the barn from the outside. The sound of the closing door took you by surprise, but even though you got spooked, you didn&#39;t let yourself spill the oats from your mouth.<br />
<br />
After a few, uninterrupted, moments of mindless munching, you realise you are all alone in the barn. Your feast comes to an end as you decide, that the food can wait, while you try to evaluate your current vessel and living courters.<br />
<br />
Being a first time barn dweller, you are intrigued by the idea of living in one, but it doesn&#39;t really excite you too much. &quot;It is incredibly dull.&quot;, you think, since all it has in it is hay, few tools and a feeder. The walls are in shade of worn-out beige, which would make a person think this barn really isn&#39;t maintained that often, especially since you could see rat and/or mouse holes on some parts of the barn. Size of barn is cca 6 meters high, 8 meters wide and 7 meters deep, so it is not too big or too small, but just right. Even though this deteriorated building isn&#39;t much, it makes you feel warm and safe, also the idea of someone caring about you makes you feel a wee bit happier and cozier.<br />
<br />
When you first entered this body, few minutes ago, you didnt really know what to expect. At first all you thought about was your tail, and how to control it, but you got a hang of it pretty soon. This helped you realise how fast swipes of the tail sure make for a nice fly swatter. Next thing on your repertoire was learning how to move your body in a natural way. Thankfully, just by transforming into a horse, your body became one with the movements pretty soon, since your whole, previous locomotive system knowledge, assimilated into now existing system without much problem. <br />
<br />
Your most desired change, however, remained unexplored, since you didnt really have time to investigate your underside. Until you were left alone that is. With unusual amount of shyness, you become hesitant of looking below, and shuffle on the same place for a few hours until twilight comes, after which you start to peak underneath yourself. Just to see, your sheet, in its place. A mere glance, made your legs quiver with joy and your penis to expand. Your human mind is overwhelmed, but your stallion mind knows what to do. You, almost with a hypnotic glare, call your love tube out of its den. Desire within you grows from second to second. Your penis reaches critical mass and starts to shed tears of joy. In hopes of reaching the final destination, you commence hitting your belly with it. Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t as pleasurable as you initially thought, so you, with your strong jaws, grab ever so gently by the flaring tip, and start tugging. This feeling cant be matched with anything you have previously experienced. It doesn&#39;t take you long to unload the whole magazine in your mouth. It overflows your gaping cavity as you hold onto the tip until it stops. You try to swallow as much of the syrup as you can, while the taste and the release leaves you satisfied. The leftovers of your, pleasure escapade, can be seen on the floor beneath you and on your face, as they drip from the edge of your lips. With your last ounces of excitement, you try to lick the remaining seed of your face. Your futile attempt at cleaning yourself left stains on your fur, which can only be cleaned by the human hand. As your final, desperate endeavor to clean the stable and yourself, you throw hay around to cover the evidence of a spillage. While the puddle was covered succesfully, you were still in stains, but now parts of hay were stuck to them. You considered it a good enough job, even though, stallion aroma could be smelt.<br />
<br />
Tired from wearing yourself out, you rest on some clean hay. <br />
You start to think if this transformation was really needed, but you console yourself with that, it will give you new experiences. However, you are not satisfied with your own answer, since this experiences really won&#39;t be needed in my regular human life. &quot;Was I content with the transformation at the very start?&quot;, is your first worry as you lay on hay. It slightly disturbs you that this could be your final life. Your final way of life. A horse life. &quot;It can&#39;t be, magic barber wouldn&#39;t lie to me, would he?&quot; you, full of fear, ask. But you cant get an answer and you know it, so you calm down and try to make sense of it all. &quot;He said he will visit in a month, so he might transform me back, then. Thats ok. I can live for a month as a horse.&quot; with a relaxed sigh you accept your fate. By accepting your fate you start to wonder if you enjoy being a horse, since you did enjoy testing the body out, and since you are stuck in it for a month. Horse orgasm was better than when you were human you discovered, and the graceful movement of a horse really pleased you. Under a period of 1 minute you thought of few more reasons why it would be nice to be a horse for a month and those are: grooming (you just never got cared like that as a human), lesser worries (no need to pay the bills). It wasn&#39;t too much but it made you much more content with this, horse life. Safe to say that, this and the thought that you actually love horses, made you happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Few moments passed, until something started to peck your mind. &quot;Where am I tho?&quot; you wondered, since you were pretty much transported into a picture. It was a surreal experience and still is. But instead of panic, you start to consider the possibilites of your current reality. First is simple; a dream. Second is a bit more worrying; a nice trip due to drugged up picture and more than likely missing kidney. Third is esoteric; by using knowledge of the eldritch beings you are transported to a pocket dimension in which your soul is stuck for all eternity. To roam as a being that is under the influence of a shapeshifting manager, that prolongs your life by changing your form, every month. Whatever the answer is, you wont be the one to solve it, since you are going to try and enjoy life for awhile.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the night grew stronger, and your thoughts drifted further, you fell asleep with a cheeky smile on your face, in excitement for tommorow.</p>
