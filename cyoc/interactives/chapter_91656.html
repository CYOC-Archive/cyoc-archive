<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Subject 2 was Chris&#39; good buddy and fellow wrestling jock, Dominic. Jeff looked over his profile, snickering as he thought of ways to make mischief with it. <br />
<br />
Dominic was 80% straight, but also 20% gay. That was perfect for what Jeff had planned. He brought up the rest of Dominic&#39;s stats: male, 21 years old, 6&#39;1&quot;, 190 pounds, muscular and smooth. The first thing was to make Dominic a bit taller. Jeff inched the slider up until it read 6&#39;4&quot;--a full two inches taller than Chris. Next was weight. There were numerous subfields that could be opened. Jeff went to the one labeled &quot;muscle&quot; and began sliding it to the right, until Dominic&#39;s total weight reached 350 pounds. Whereas Chris was being turned into a skinny twig, Dominic would be a muscle freak. <br />
<br />
Finally Jeff opened up Dominic&#39;s other sexual details. He saw that when erect, Dominic was a respectable (but not extraordinary) seven inches. With a few clicks of Jeff&#39;s mouse, that became nine inches. Erect circumference was five inches; two clicks turned that into a girthy seven. At last, Jeff reached the &quot;sex drive&quot; score--Dominic was a six on the ten point scale. Jeff chuckled as he dragged the slider to the right, until it rested at 9.5. He had considered making Dominic a full 10, but worried that such an extreme number might have consequences beyond the fun he had planned for his brother and his brother&#39;s bud. He tripled the size of the jock&#39;s balls, just for fun. <br />
<br />
For a final tweak, Jeff set things so that he and Chris would be aware of Dominic&#39;s changes, but no one else. Giggling evilly, he hit the button to make the changes take place. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
In the next room, Chris and Dominic were lounging about, chatting about their girlfriends, the wrestling coach, and whatever else seemed worth gossiping about. Chris felt the change first, gasping as a shudder ran through him. His powerful muscles started to shrink, losing their hardness as they withered away. His body hair fell out in great clumps, only to disappear into the ether. His hair darkened and lengthened, his cock shrunk, and his balls swelled. Chris gasped again as the changes settled in, then blinked a few times, as if nothing at all had happened. &quot;Sorry, what were we talking about?&quot; he asked, looking at Dominic, clearly befuddled. But as he looked his friend up and down, Chris couldn&#39;t help but think to himself what a fine body Dominic had, and how very much he would like to have wild, kinky sex with him. <br />
<br />
Dominic&#39;s mouth moved, but no sound came out. He saw what had just happened to his buddy Chris, a muscular jock like him, reduced to some sort of wimpy emo! Although Chris was as tall as before, the blond stud who had wrestled so many opponents into submission was gone. Dominic jumped up from his chair in alarm, not entirely sure if he should flee, or stay and try to figure out what was going on. The way Chris was looking at him... there was a hunger there. Desire. It creeped Dominic out, even if a small part of him enjoyed the attention. <br />
<br />
Then a shudder ran through Dominic&#39;s body. At first his muscles tingled pleasantly, but as the feeling spread they burned, like after a killer workout. He grunted in confusion, taking a step back, letting out a low groan of pain as his bones shifted and grew, making him taller. Another grunt came as his muscles throbbed, seeming to get larger with each breath he took. His tee shirt and shorts struggled to contain him as he swelled, filling up with thick, hard muscle. Ultimately, it was all too much for his clothes and they began to slowly shred, seams popping and cloth tearing, until his shirt and shorts clung from his huge body in tatters. He let out a low moan of pleasure as his cock and balls joined the act, growing larger and more potent. He quickly became erect, his new tool jutting out from under the wreckage of his shorts, tenting his tight underwear dramatically. <br />
<br />
Chris watched all of this with wonder. It didn&#39;t make sense--people didn&#39;t just suddenly turn into muscle freaks right in front of your eyes! His new compassion kicked in, and he jumped off the bed, rushing toward his friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dominic, are you all right?&quot; Chris asked breathlessly, reaching out to try and steady his towering bud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course,&quot; Dominic replied. He didn&#39;t understand why Chris was acting so weird--could it have to do with how he shrunk, moments ago? <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course?&quot; Chris shrieked, &quot;Dom, you just grew huge right in front of me! You must have added 150 pounds! And now you&#39;re taller than me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dominic scoffed. &quot;I&#39;ve always been taller than you, Chris.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris wanted to protest, but he felt something press against his hip. He looked down, and saw the tent in Dominic&#39;s underwear, pushing aside the shreds of the huge man&#39;s shorts. It poked his hip again, seemingly innocently. Chris looked up, and saw Dominic take in a few deep breaths, his huge chest rising and falling, clearly trying to gain control of his raging erection, his rising lust. &quot;Poor thing, let me help with that,&quot; Chris said softly, going to his knees and pulling down Dominic&#39;s tight underwear and torn shorts. The large dick and huge balls eagerly bounced free. Dominic tried to protest, but the words died in his mouth. He was horny as fuck, and if his best bud wanted to help him out, well, that&#39;s what friends are for, right? <br />
<br />
Chris leaned in, running his hands up and down Dominic&#39;s massive thighs. He couldn&#39;t believe how big the man&#39;s legs were now, how impressive his quadriceps muscles had become. He leaned in, gently licking the tip of the muscleman&#39;s big cock. &quot;Aww fuck, don&#39;t tease me like that bro,&quot; Dominic growled, pushing his hips forward, trying to drive his dick into Chris&#39; mouth. But Chris had other ideas, dodging the torpedo aimed at him, letting it rub against his cheek instead. Then Chris went down, licking Dominic&#39;s huge balls, sucking on them gently. The huge man howled in response, his lust skyrocketing as the skinny emo teased him. &quot;F-fuck Chris... gonna lose control, you keep doing that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the smaller man replied, his voice full of seduction and challenge, before he moved in to nibble on one of Dominic&#39;s huge nuts, his teeth scraping across it slowly. <br />
<br />
That drove Dominic over the edge. He reached down and picked Chris up, flinging him unceremoniously on his bed. The big man followed, reaching down to tear Chris&#39; clothes off of him, not caring if a seam was compromised or a button lost in the process. Finally Dominic ripped off his own shirt, tossing the wreckage aside with all the items he&#39;d taken off of Chris. &quot;You made me do this,&quot; Dominic growled, &quot;You&#39;ve got me so horny I feel like I&#39;m going to explode!&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris was shocked by Dominic&#39;s sudden forcefulness, but turned on by it as well. He reached up and put his hands on the big man&#39;s thick chest, caressing it, pulling on the hefty nips. <br />
<br />
The huge wrestler couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. He was about to fuck his best bro, and the guy seemed to want it! But he was too horny for anything else. He roughly forced Chris&#39; legs apart, lined up his big dick, and thrust it hard into Chris&#39; ass. The smaller man&#39;s eyes bugged out in shock at being invaded by such a large tool, and he shrieked in pain. Dominic paused, worried about hurting his friend, but surprisingly it was Chris who urged him on. Between Chris&#39; enhanced homosexuality and his new hyperemotional state, he was determined to have Dominic fuck him until the big man was satisfied. <br />
<br />
---<br />
In the next room, Jeff was surprised by his own success. He could hear the grunts and cries from his brother&#39;s room, not to mention the sound of the bed protesting as Dominic fucked Chris hard. Jeff crept out to the hallway, peeking through the doorway to watch the show. He was treated to the sight of Dominic&#39;s huge back, looming over Chris, the latter&#39;s thin legs splayed up in the air. Jeff was momentarily mesmerized by the sight of Dominic&#39;s huge muscles in action, seemingly all focused on the same goal of ramming his big dick into Chris as hard and fast as possible. Feeling his own dick start to harden, Jeff crept back to his own room, closing the door behind him. &quot;Damn...&quot; he muttered to himself as he returned to the computer. He knew he was making big changes in the next room, but seeing the effects on display like that was something else! Still, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but be curious. He now knew the Chronivac worked. What would he change next?</p>
