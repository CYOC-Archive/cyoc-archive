<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think,&quot; Neil said with a grin, &quot;I have a pretty good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Brock put an arm around Neil&#39;s broad shoulders, &quot;Do go on. We can use my place for our nightly fun times!&quot; Well, that made things pretty easy. And honestly, Neil, with how his place was so crowded and messy... he wasn&#39;t sure about bringing a woman or a man over to his place.<br />
<br />
The person Neil had decided to call was a young woman who had just been very eager to try to get Neil out of his shirt at that bar - she had really wanted to get a photo with &quot;Mr. Physique&quot;. &quot;Her name&#39;s Clarissa, she was pretty hot, and I think she was into me, and open to gettin&#39; freaky with another man too. Called me Mr. Physique...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so she&#39;s really into you, then.&quot; Brock lightly punched Neil on the shoulder, &quot;You lucky dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil had found that she was very interested in him, outright touching his arm and chest in the middle of their flirtation and the drinks at the bar. He&#39;d known from the moment she kept on feeling him up that way that she was gonna be a sure thing tonight.<br />
<br />
...Though admittedly, Neil found himself thinking, he was somewhat surprised. Here he was enjoying a night out with a former foe of his, and he seemed so at home with flirting, with sexuality, with having somebody just all over him. Neil found himself looking in the passenger side mirror as he and Brock got into the car to go back to Brock&#39;s place. And just as well, Neil looked at Brock - for all that the jock had physically aged, well into his mid-forties, his mental age had stayed the same.<br />
<br />
On some level, Neil wondered if that factor of physical age might come into play.<br />
<br />
As they drove, Neil called up Clarissa, who seemed to anticipate the call; &quot;Hey...I remember this number. Pretty boy with the big muscles and the dashing smile, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got me,&quot; Neil responded, &quot;That&#39;s totally me. Would you be down for some fun with me and my friend Brock over at his place? I&#39;m pretty sure we can do dinner too as well as the nightly fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock nodded in affirmation.<br />
<br />
Clarissa seemed excited by the prospects of this, &quot;Ohh you have a friend! That sounds sexy! Is he ripped as fuck too...?&quot; She definitely seemed to be into guys like him, Neil thought with a degree of satisfaction. Haah, here he was enjoying a night on the town and sleeping with a woman who was just into his body. He almost wanted to chuckle - it was like he was usurping Matt&#39;s status as king jock of the school. Though he swore he wouldn&#39;t use his power for evil.<br />
<br />
Brock evidently heard her inquiry, and shouted, &quot;Twenty two inch arms, babe!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh twenty two inches...!&quot; Clarissa was now very much interested indeed, and she said, &quot;Count me in. Just give me an address and I&#39;ll be there, just let me dart home to take a little pill. Hmm, usually I have to beg and plead to get my dates to go along with a little MMF action. You guys sound almost too good to be true.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the call ended, Neil looked over at Brock with a grin. Which was returned in kind and, as the two drove toward Brock&#39;s home, they fistbumped in the car and shared a kiss - both feeling eager to get this evening underway. It occurred to Neil he had never been to Brock&#39;s place. The guy hadn&#39;t exactly invited Neil along to any of the parties he threw before, but he guessed there was a first time for everything.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Brock&#39;s home was a surprisingly upscale affair. An apartment he lived out of via a trustfund, Brock it seemed was of substantially higher wealth than Neil had assumed just based on how rough and bro-like he was. There was a large bedroom that promised to see quite a bit of use tonight, lit by about three lamps, with a red rug on the floor - the bed being an enormous queen size bed fitted with blankets and a sheet. There was even a full size mirror by the bed - the purpose for which was transparently clear. Purely for appreciating the view as sex got underway.<br />
<br />
The rest of the place was surprisingly classy, and Neil was left wondering if he might be able to come back here some time for the parties Brock threw on the regular.<br />
<br />
As they got in, Brock started getting ready for the evening, drawing Neil&#39;s attention. The newly minted bodybuilder-jock crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked with a sense of enthusiasm as the larger of the two got ready for the night&#39;s events. The massive jock removed his button up shirt, showing a white tank top underneath strained by the massive musculature of Brock Medina.<br />
<br />
He removed his dress pants next, revealing a tight pair of boxer shorts, which only barely covered Brock&#39;s groin, though his balls hardly made as much of an impression as his cock or ass. Brock whistled, &quot;Whew, glad to get all that stuff off for the night. You ready for some fun tonight, big man?&quot; A grin spread on Brock&#39;s face as he brought Neil in close, &quot;Yeah, yeah you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil gulped as Brock opened up his shirt most of the way down, and then outright moaned as the man started rubbing the front of his own tight dress pants. Neil took a harsh breath and gasped, &quot;...Fuck you&#39;re good at this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, man. Just getting you nice and revved up.&quot; Brock then slapped Neil&#39;s ass, drawing one more moan out of the (physically) younger man. That was when the doorbell rang, and Brock leaned back, looking at Neil - who was now excited in more than one way. &quot;Well, man, best bring your date in. Lets get this underway. I&#39;m looking forward to a fun time tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another slap on Neil&#39;s ass, and the bodybuilder went along to go answer the door. A cursory look through the peephole showed it was indeed Clarissa...now dressed even more enticingly, and ready for a night they&#39;d all enjoy. As Neil opened the door, he said, &quot;Welcome to Casa De Medina, Miss Clarissa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh my! Someone came to the door already happy to see me,&quot; she said as she stepped inside, &quot;I&#39;m feeling in a mood for fun and then dinner afterwards. This...this is a very nice place, by the way. Your friend must be quite the man of means...&quot; She mused and Neil eagerly stepped after her as she headed in toward the bedroom. It was time to see how the night went. The first erotic liaison of the night, and it was already shaping up to be pretty spicy...</p>
