<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selina wasn&#39;t quite sure how or when it happened...only that it did.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the week she made good on her word and began what she liked to call operation &quot;terrible twos&quot;. Starting off small Selina would do little things like act fussy in the middle of being changed, not cooperate during feedings and complain when she was put down for naps. But when that showed no signs of working she decided to up her game and basically act like a brat. Selina became very demanding and if she didn&#39;t get her way or wasn&#39;t given what she wanted fast enough she&#39;d end up throwing a crying fit.  As for her diapers she used them constantly hoping to overload her Uncle Al with wet and poopy Pampers. Speaking of number two&#39;s whenever Selina made doodie she made sure to sit in it a few times so as to smush it around her bottom and make clean up even harder. Another one of her ploys was to try and stay in a dirty diaper for as long as possible, easily stinking up whatever room she was currently in. Though Selina didn&#39;t do it quite as often to avoid getting a nasty rash. And yet despite throwing all this at him the man never once got angry or upset at her. He would just smile and hold her until she calmed down, then lay her down on the changing table and get her a fresh diaper if it was needed, lovingly and tenderly wiping her dirty bottom until it was clean. It was kinda creepy how nothing she did got on the guy&#39;s nerves. Well that and at times it seemed like he was happy she was acting her age. Even more unsettling was the fact that a part of her enjoyed being cared for by the man.<br />
<br />
As the days passed Selina remained committed to her routine at the same time a change began to take place completely unbeknownst to her. First she made her uncle switch her from sippy cups back to baby bottles, saying she wouldn&#39;t drink out of anything else otherwise. Next she demanded her small bed with guard rails be replaced with a crib. When he argued that there wasn&#39;t a difference in functionality, Selina just said there was a difference and the subject was dropped. Then she developed a love for pacifiers due to it being Uncle Al&#39;s go to move for when she started crying and he needed to calm her down quick. The first few times she spit it out, but at some point she kept the rubber nipple in her mouth and suckled it. Finally the last change to take place was when Uncle Al presented a training potty to her and asked her if she wanted to try learning to use the toilet. Selina&#39;s response to the offer was to angrily kick the thing before pooping herself. She then flopped down on her back and proceeded to throw the mother of all tantrums, only finally settling down when her diaper was changed. As a clean pamper was being taped on her, she failed to notice the pleased grin on the man&#39;s face. At some point Selina became aware that she had succumb to and embraced her new age&#39;s role without meaning to. Rather than get scared or mad at the epiphany she simply continued on as usual but with the added benefit of the clarity. Selina did however stop acting out quite as much and behave more. Though she didn&#39;t give it up entirely as she enjoyed letting out her baby side.<br />
<br />
Sunday eventually rolled around and found Selina relaxing in her nursery. Though one would mistake it for a daycare given how large and well set up it was. Aside from having the main necessities it was stockpiled with the latest toys, an indoor jungle gym playset (like the ones at McDonald&#39;s) and a designated tv area with a seventy inch flatscreen and a library of animated movies. After her usual morning change and breakfast Selina was left to play while her uncle did some work in his office. A few hours spent  with her toys the twenty six month old eventually grew bored and toddled over to the tv to watch a movie, the baby girl clad in just her diaper. Though she had been offered clothes to wear, she preferred going about in just her disposable underwear. Lying down on her front she put on Disney&#39;s Lion King, swinging her legs back and forth and sucking her thumb since she left her pacifier in her crib as she watched the animated classic. When the &#39;I can&#39;t wait to be king&#39; song came on Selina actually got up and danced to it while singing along. Just as it came to an end and she was about to sit back down she felt a familiar pressure in her bowels. Squatting down a little Selina grinned as she pushed a thick log into the back of her padding, the long solid curling in on itself as it hit the seat. Laying back down she resumed watching the film, now with the added bulge in the back of her diaper. Her bladder cut loose a few minutes later and she soaked the front with a lot of pee. Going to the bathroom, anytime and anywhere was just how the toddler liked it.<br />
<br />
Right as the final battle was just starting did her Uncle Al walk into the room. &quot;Is my little girl enjoying her movie?&quot; he asked to which Selina responded with absentminded nod and &quot;Uh huh.&quot; The man smiled until he got a whiff of a smelly odor and quickly deduced his baby girl needed to be changed. Not wanting to disrupt her movie experience he brought the supplies over and kneeled down beside. Moving the toddler onto her back before untaping and opening up her diaper. Selina was too transfixed by the fighting lions on screen that she didn&#39;t notice her legs being lifted, the removal of the used padding or even the wiping of her privates. In fact it was until the credits started rolling that she became even aware of the brand new diaper and the old balled up taped one sitting a few feet away. Sitting up and beaming at the sight of the new garment Selina reached down and rubbed the front with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now that you&#39;re clean and I have your attention I have some good news.&quot; Her head perked up at that. &quot;My scientists were able to engineer the antidote to turn you back to your original age. Actually they found a way to reverse the youth formula all together, but the point is you can become an adult again. I can have it administered within the hour and then you can leave with your money, that is if you want. I wouldn&#39;t mind taking care of you forever, and with the youth pills in my possession coupled with my vast fortune I can definitely make it happen. You can stay in diapers for as long as your little heart desires and never have to grow out of them. But of course the desicion is still ultimately yours, I just wanted you to know all your options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprisingly Selina didn&#39;t have to think long about it as immediately gave her answer, choosing to...</p>
