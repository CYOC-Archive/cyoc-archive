<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her arm firmly gripping his, Emily led John into another room. As they walked, Emily told him exactly what he had to do.<br />
<br />
When they got into the next room, they found a sinister-looking man dressed like John was, sitting in a chair sipping a drink. Emily spoke. &quot;Byron Spelstorm, this is my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man smiled in an unsettling way. He got up and put out his hand. &quot;Pleased to meet you, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
John shook his hand. &quot;Likewise.&quot; Emily nudged him, and he added, &quot;But I'm afraid I have bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
Byron looked slightly puzzled. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
He swallowed. &quot;My daughter will not be marrying you. I cannot in good conscience allow her to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glared at Emily and John. &quot;What? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiding his nervousness, John continued. &quot;Because of your reputation. The Spelstorm name is not what it was. My daughter will not be associated with the scandals that have surrounded your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Byron's face went red. &quot;Very well. I suggest you leave, then.&quot; he said, apparently barely controlling his anger.<br />
<br />
Emily spoke up as Byron went back to his chair. &quot;It's for the best, Byron.&quot; She turned and guided John out of the room.<br />
<br />
Once they were out of the room, Emily breathed deeply. &quot;Oh, thank you! I'm free!&quot;<br />
<br />
John smiled. &quot;No problem, I was....&quot; he trailed off as he saw Emily slowly becoming transparent, &quot;Can you change me back now?&quot; he asked before it was too late.<br />
With her last wisps of existence she said, &quot;it is my gift to you, now being a man of honor and respec....&quot; And she was gone.<br />
Confused by her words, Johnny stood still for a moment waiting to be returned to normal, and he was relieved when everything was twisting and changing around him. &quot;Finally&quot; he thought, I need to get back home soon. When the room's twists and turns subsided he noted that though he wasn't in that mansion. He was in a different one altogether, and not at home like he had hoped. This mansion, though, was definitely a newer one.  He saw a 42 inch HDTV, so he knew he was back in real time, he just didn't understand why he was here.<br />
So Johnny decided he was done with this and he started to find his way out when he felt really weird, like someone had tied weights onto every limb. Despite his exhaustion, he walked around what he observed was a bedroom, until he came upon the full length mirror next to the dresser. That's when he was stopped flat. Instead of being transported back to his time and normal self, he was transported back to his time, but kept the father's body he was put in. He was the same rich old man, but back in his normal time. This isn't what he wanted! He looked around for any trace of Emily, this man's daughter but he couldn't see her anywhere. Now panicking, he went back to the mirror and stripped, determined to prove that this body wasn't him. But the mirror showed him the old man still. He looked deep into his eyes for the real him, but only saw old eyes surrounded by wrinkled crows feet. He rubbed his balding head, and pulled his white sideburns and moustache, but they were fully attached. He tried to grab at his now humongous fat belly, but no matter how he pushed or pulled, the massive gut just swayed and bounced, giving him the oddest of sensations he's never had before. He looked back at the mirror and surveyed the naked grossly fat old man he had now become and was terrified. <br />
He grabbed his clothes, thinking if he left the house than all would be put back to normal. He looked at the tag of his slacks, it said waist size 56, what an enormous man! he put his 4x polo back on and attached the old man suspenders, feeling every movement on his now very large belly. He slipped on his fancy shoes and made his way outside, trying to think of anything but his predicament. He found himself in a busy Britain town, having no idea how he ended up here. After accidentally signaling a taxi when he was really trying not to fall over not being used to his weight difference, he decided the taxi would be much preferable seeing how he was already huffing from exertion.<br />
Struggling to get in the cab, the driver asks &quot;where to big guy&quot;. This was even more unsettling to Johnny because there was still a hope that this was not real until someone else also noticed it, and he would never have been called &quot;big guy&quot; before today. Not really knowing what to say, Johnny thought he might as well drink since he was thrown in this situation, so he said, &quot;Whatever bar you suggest.&quot; To which the cab driver once again said, &quot;You got it gramps.&quot; Which was definitely depressing and scary for him. Even if he was mistakenly called &quot;big guy&quot;, someone like Johnny would surely never be called &quot;gramps&quot;. He really was the old fat man. He would find a way out of this body, but first he was going to try and drink. After being dropped off at the bar, he paid the cab (he found a wallet full of money in his pocket) and went in.<br />
The bar didn't have too many people in it, and as he waddled towards the bar, feeling every pound of his belly swaying, he took a seat and stared forward. And this particular bar, unfortunately had the mirror behind all the glass shelves, and he had a perfect view of the large old man's face that was staring back at him. He was determined to forget this and looked away, when the young bartender walked over and said, &quot;what can I get for you old-timer&quot; Leaving absolutely no trace of doubt that he was now indeed an old-timer.</p>
