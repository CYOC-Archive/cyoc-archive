<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Golden reptilian eyes snapped open, pupils darting madly. The room was drenched in shadow, yet he could somehow see. Scattered pages and notes lay scattered around the room, he noted with haste as he rose to his feet, staggeringly momentarily before he managed to catch himself against a nearby wall, claws catching moss in the cracks. <br />
<br />
His eyes scanned his new body curiously, black plated scales across his muscled chest and crotch, contrasting the silver scales coating the rest of his body and the golden claws adorning his fingertips and toes. A claw danced across the center of his chest, the original golden claw from his predecessor protruding outwards, tip facing upwards. Comparing it to his own, they were practically identical, runes etched onto the exterior of the golden talons.<br />
<br />
Flexing his hand curiously, the dragon&#39;s hand drifted to his arm, claws tracing upwards to caress his overly large bicep. It quickly left his bicep to admire his plated pecs, toying with a nipple out of mere curiosity. Had it not been for the growth of his neck, his head would&#39;ve most likely been crushed between the two mountains of muscle. Despite his torso being plated, the touch of his claws radiated such pleasure he couldn&#39;t help but curl his toes, talons digging into the stone floor.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Mere curiosity, hmm?&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
The draconic Isaac exclaimed at the voice in his head, bells ringing all throughout his mind. His reptilian gaze darted around the room as it had when he had awakened, ignorance etched onto his very soul.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Mortals, how forgetful you tend to be…&#39;</em></b> His predecessor&#39;s voice whispered within him, dejection present within its voice. <b><em>&#39;I suppose in the end it can&#39;t be helped, my champion. The merging of two souls is not a painless process as you so clearly experienced… I could only make it go by as quickly as possible, lest you&#39;d have perished from the drawn out changes.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s claws scratched tiredly at his head, before his fingers gripped at the jagged horns protruding from behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;I… see…&quot; The paladin commented, disorientation ever prevalent.<br />
<br />
A sigh filling his mind regained his attention. <b><em>&#39;It appears the strain from the immediate transformation has also left you rather… depleted…&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;I… didn&#39;t exactly plan on having a seizure during it.&quot; Isaac grumbled, admiring the scaled tail protruding from his backside, experimentally whipping the new appendage around. &quot;And becoming a seven foot tall overly muscular dragonman is also quite disorienting. Having a tail is not how I expected it to be, not that I ever wanted one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I forgot about the wings too.&quot;<br />
<br />
An amused chuckle resounded from the dragon as Isaac caused the tail to slam into his crotch. <b><em>&#39;Humans truly are vulnerable to physical change. Your Order of Paladins seems ignorant of this.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Ignorant isn&#39;t the right term, it&#39;s more <em>opposed</em> to change. Only sadists would want to willingly alter their bodies. Individuals who willingly corrupt themselves are the scum of the Earth, they care little for the innocent lives taken. I feel no sorrow for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;You seem quite passionate about your opinion, paladin. Was it not carelessness and stubbornness that brought you here?&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
Isaac reptilian eyes rolled, closing momentarily as a burst of smoke flew from his nostrils. Swiping his claws through the air, the smog dispersed. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what brought me here. Now you&#39;re stuck with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The progenitor&#39;s baritone voice chuckled once again, amusement ever present within its tone. <b><em>&#39;I am simply an observer, paladin. Your thoughts interest me, as do those of all humans. While pity served as motivation in proposing the pact, my kind has despised the corruption since it&#39;s birth long ago.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of corruption…&quot; Isaac whispered, claws tapping against the lower jaw of his draconic face. His gaze shifted to the table where he and found the progenitor&#39;s claw. While the remainder of Crawnav&#39;s notes had been sent flying by the magical aura of the merging, the artifacts remained. <br />
<br />
His claws clicked against the stone floor, predatory eyes firmly focused on an odd ring-like relic. Eyes narrowing, the dragon&#39;s head tilted as he picked up the ring, it&#39;s silver color matching the scales of his body. Beautiful and rather intricate designs etched across it&#39;s pure surface, the figure of a woman embossed at its center.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;The Deity of Purity?&#39;</em></b> The progenitor&#39;s voice fell silent as Isaac curiously toyed with the ornate piece of jewelry, fixated on its silver coloration. <b><em>&#39;...You&#39;d do well to put the ring on instead of playing with it like a child.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m simply… <em>observing</em>.&quot; The draconic paladin whispered, head tilting in thought. &quot;I remember this depiction of Her Grace. I was told of her blessings upon us mortals during my days of paladin training…&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Still enamored by the silver color are you?&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;It looks a lot like my, and by extension, <em>your</em> scales.&quot; Isaac noted aloud, placing the ring flat against his palm.<br />
<br />
The voice in his head exhaled deeply, sending a jolt down his spine. <b><em>&#39;You are trained well in the arts of flattery, my champion. But no, the deity and I are not one and the same.</em></b><br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Dragons and gods, while we  both resist the corruption, we are not entirely on good terms with each other...</em></b><br />
<br />
Maw parting with a breath, Isaac gently lifted the ring, pinched between his claws. While initially worried his finger would be too large, relief filled him as it slid on without issue. He felt a lukewarm energy fill his draconic body, the ring radiating with power. The effects were clearly subtle at best, granted his corruption had already been reduced by the progenitor&#39;s assimilation of his form.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Finally putting it on? A wise choice.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;A seal can only last so long until it is broken, dragon. Consider this ring a contingency plan of sorts.&quot; Isaac replied calmly, allowing his hand to drop to his side. Glancing the other artifacts left by Crawnav, he caressed his lower jaw with a claw. &quot;Anything else worth salvaging from here?&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Crawnav carried many artifacts with him, all collected from different parts of this world. If you believe you require another relic, choose at your own risk.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;...I think becoming a hunky dragonman and getting a ring is more than enough at this point. You don&#39;t sound very reassuring either.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;I see…&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
Backing away from the desk of relics, Isaac&#39;s gaze dropped to his feet, face furrowing in amusement at the sword that lay beside him. Leaning over to pick it up, the dragonman&#39;s head tilted in curiosity as he twirled it lightly within his grip, testing its weight. It was practically as light as a feather, granted he had gained an immense boost in strength. It was a miracle he could still hold the sword in the first place.<br />
<br />
Attention returning to his body, the draconic paladin&#39;s teeth grit in thought, his eyes drifting downwards to his plated crotch, fingers caressing what appeared to be a slit where his balls should&#39;ve been. Suddenly growing desperate, the dragon inhaled sharply as the tip of his rod emerged from the depths of the slit, drops of semen leaking and staining his scales. Stifling a moan as he reluctantly pulled away, Isaac&#39;s predatory gaze snapped upwards to scan the room, maw clenched tight.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Quite resilient when it comes to sex it seems. Anyone else would&#39;ve already observed their newly gained equipment to the fullest.&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t flatter yourself, dragon. I just don&#39;t find it wise to walk around these dark catacombs naked. I thought you&#39;d made me female for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Your scales are stronger than they seem, and while it would certainly be amusing, I have no desire to bring such complications upon you.&#39;</em></b> The progenitor whispered with a chuckle, voice filled with amusement. <b><em>&#39;Humans tend to pride themselves on their choice of clothing…&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
&quot;This is <em>certainly</em> going to take some getting used to.&quot; Isaac muttered as he traced his claws along his hip, the dragon&#39;s offhand commentary not aiding the situation. He wiggled his toes, unused to having three-toed feet.<br />
<br />
Ignoring his internal companion&#39;s voice, Isaac&#39;s gaze shifted to an iron door a few meters away from the table, an exit. His claws clicked against the stone floor as he trudged over to the door, iron blade within one hand. Nearing it, his head tilted at the unusual lock placed across the door. Unlocking it without difficulty, the door opened to reveal another hall of stone.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the hall, the dragonman&#39;s golden orbs examined the expanse of stone. Per the rest of the crypt, torches lay lined across the stone walls; yet here the flames flickered a mystical violet. His scales shivered at the sight of the everlasting flames, an eerie feeling drifting into him. It&#39;d be of little surprise if the torches were lit by magic, especially when factoring in their unusual color.<br />
<br />
Sword braced in the case of an encounter, Isaac continued onwards. The claws on his feet had resulted in clicks accompanying each step, which meant sneaking around was a lost cause, and the feeling of a tail dragging behind him didn&#39;t help either. Even with his wings folded, the dim torchlit hallways left him with an immense feeling of claustrophobia, made worse by his larger height.<br />
<br />
The paladin&#39;s scales tensed as the sound of footsteps resounded further down the hall, snapping him free of his thoughts as they increased in volume.<br />
<br />
Sliding against a nearby wall as he reached the corner of the hallway, the dragonman forced himself to press his weight onto his heels. He grit his fangs tightly as he craned his head to glance at the source of the steps that were not his own.<br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s draconic features grimaced at the sight, pearly white fangs glinting as the dull violet light illuminated them. Ways down the hallway staggered what appeared to be an ice demon of sorts. It&#39;s eyes were black and mad, teeth sharp and bared, and it&#39;s entirely body lay exposed for all to see. The tail protruding from its backside swayed slowly, rhythmically in sync with its limping footsteps. The demon&#39;s member, almost a foot in length, stood strong and erect as it walked, the mere sight of it unnatural and uncanny.<br />
<br />
The first demon he&#39;d seen up close, and most certainly not the last.<br />
<br />
Hissing to himself in frustration, Isaac leaped out from the hallway without hesitation, delivering a well-timed slash to the demon&#39;s abdomen. <br />
<br />
For a moment, the blade halted, refusing to sink past the demon&#39;s thick flesh. Veins in his arms bulging, a roar burbled from the depths of the dragon&#39;s throat, who pulled his sword free from the ghoul&#39;s stomach before plunging it forwards towards its chest. <br />
<br />
The demon let out a spine chilling scream, clawing at the blade futilely. A white hot rage burned in Isaac&#39;s reptilian eyes, the paladin forcing the ghoul towards the wall. Victory shone upon him as the demon&#39;s soulless eyes grew dull, it&#39;s arms falling to its side uselessly.<br />
<br />
Kicking the body free of his blade, Isaac paused to observe at what he&#39;d done. Within mere seconds he reduced a demon to a lifeless bag of flesh. Had he been anything else, it was doubtful the beast would&#39;ve gone down as easily as it had.<br />
<br />
<b><em>&#39;Seems you&#39;re rather merciless in your procedures…&#39;</em></b> The progenitor&#39;s words rang, causing Isaac&#39;s head to snap up. <b><em>&#39;But I suppose this will serve as a warning for those who dare to stand in your way?&#39;</em></b><br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s gaze fell to his blade, meeting his reflection in the metallic sheen of the bloodied blade, golden eyes blazing with righteousness.</p>
