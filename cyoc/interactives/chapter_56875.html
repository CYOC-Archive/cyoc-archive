<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eliza sat still silently observing all in her victorian era dress, while Betty asked. &quot;How could <br />
Monica of possibly known that? About the mob of thugs that the witches changed?  You <br />
didn't mention her being there during the narrative.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Rosa and Monica were both given unnaturally long life spans by the witches as part of <br />
their experiments both intentionally and unintentionally, the witches were sure that Rosa <br />
and Monica loved them utterly for their gift. This was before the thorn maze was in <br />
earnest. Monica had wanted to instruct the witches' orphanage, figuring she'd be at least <br />
accepted there, and actually observed at a distance what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Monica was scared of even trying it?&quot; Maddex's head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. She was not. Not in the least. She was surprised, and it was the day she realized the <br />
witches were indeed magic users, but she wondered for a time if their power had come <br />
directly from God in spite of their attitude during her classes. In the end however, Gita, <br />
Gomorrah, and Golgatha, had no interest in Rosa 'infecting' their 'pure children' with the <br />
'pollution' of christian thought and the idea that rules existed for a reason.&quot; <br />
<br />
The children, even Alice, had gone effectively silent as the tale progressed, the battle about <br />
to occur keeping their attention utterly, Maddex's heads were just waiting for the first call <br />
sign to cover his daughters' senses. <br />
<br />
However, Abbey asked, &quot;What was it? What was it that scared Marie when she was having a <br />
waking dream? What did she see behind the raven's mask? What shocked back to reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Death.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;There are times when I would not be surprised you were not looking after my child,&quot; <br />
Gabriel asked of Azriel/Thanatos/GrimReaper, &quot;After all Death, weren't you a godfather <br />
once yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once upon a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'Of course, I do not have that kind of power to turn people into objects to begin with,' Amy <br />
thought, 'I'm not a witch or wizard, alchemist or sage. I hope Zelipe isn't getting <br />
superstitious of me...' <br />
<br />
Anne had of course, started a petition among the Pack members, not to have the shinto <br />
statues removed, but to have a small chapel consecrated on Pack grounds showing the <br />
Lamb to balance out Amy's small Shinto Shrine. <br />
<br />
Of course, Amy's interest in history wasn't limited to the origin of her adopted faith. Recent <br />
events had left her even more curious about the history of the game and read up on what <br />
precious little history of the aftermath of the game's onset had survived various purges. <br />
<br />
Supposed after mortally wounding their dearest comrade under the influence of the Game, <br />
the Hunter had Dared their dearest comrade to live. Weather The Hunter had succeeded <br />
with this use of the Game had not been recorded. <br />
<br />
It reminded Amy of an anime that Alpha Kaylee had in her collection maintained by their <br />
resident pack movie buff Jasmine. Of a young exiled prince given the power to order <br />
anyone to do any one thing he commanded of them. And in one instance ordered the love <br />
of his life to live as she bled to death in his arms, a failure that cost him just one tiny bit <br />
more of his sanity. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The same time Amy looked at the picture of the lupman form of Ame-No-Uzume Sarah <br />
was working with Ulysses when she felt like someone had just walked over her grave. She <br />
nearly dropped what she was holding for the injured Pack and Pride, but managed to catch <br />
it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah are you okay?&quot; The teenage pup and the last in the pack to receive a formal letter <br />
rank looked concerned for his sister-at-heart and official unofficial pack <br />
emotional/mental councilor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm fine Ulysses don't worry.&quot; The lavender she-wolf smiled at the young purple lupman. <br />
She knew that this feeling logically had to be just psychology, logically brought on by the <br />
recent heightened danger from Kurse.  'I feel, like there's somewhere I need to be... but I'm <br />
right here with Ulysses.' Sarah shook her head, 'Likely just nerves.' For some reason <br />
however, for the rest of the day, she kept rubber necking at the entry way statues like <br />
there was something important missing. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As a sacred rule within the Big Bad Wolf Pack, no two lupmans could ever have the same <br />
name, since surnames were considered a violation of the unifying devotion to Pack and <br />
Alpha, and Jessie, when he had tried to implement it had been met with -violent- rejection <br />
by Mr. P and quickly retracted the suggestion. On the other hand, this made it impossible <br />
to tell just from a quick glance at name records who was directly related to Jessie and who <br />
was not. <br />
<br />
While Jessie was remembered as a being a unscrupulous police chief, he was while alive <br />
considered the pinnacle of a member of the Big Bad Pack and several males and females <br />
openly wept at his funeral when he died of old age. <br />
<br />
When his means of becoming Police Chief had been uncovered after his death along with <br />
his less than savory actions, one lupman =not one of his mates= died of a heart attack in <br />
shock. Another who had built a small shrine to him in their bedroom committed suicide. <br />
And yet another was still undergoing treatment at the local mental hospital (kept outside <br />
Glendale's city limits from the danger of an patient getting their hands on a turn of the <br />
game) from her mental-break down at finding out about Jessie's hidden side he never <br />
showed his packmates, wives, or his many pups. <br />
<br />
Many of his mates and pups had left Glendale within days of the truth coming out in shame <br />
of their own accord. The rest stayed in Glendale, but left the minor scattering to the city's <br />
outskirts where the remaining members who didn't live directly at the Wolf Estate resided. <br />
<br />
Sydney was middle aged, had gray marks in her orange-ish brown fur on her body before <br />
it's time, and kept her rare hair (rather than just head fur) in a tight braid on the back of <br />
her head. Like the majority of Lupman, her fur color matched her eyes. <br />
<br />
She had once planned to follow in her father's footsteps in becoming a police officer, but <br />
the overwhelming hazing that result when the truth of her father's actions came out had <br />
forced her to leave the police academy and cost her what friends she had made (guess they <br />
weren't really friends). <br />
<br />
Of all her dreams and ambitions, and here she was, halfway through life... chopping meat. <br />
Every day was exactly like the last and every day that followed would be the same as this <br />
one until she died, and was buried in the ground and forgotten.   <br />
<br />
In a warped way, she had almost WELCOMED Kurse's insanity, at least then she didn't have <br />
the wits to appreciate how worthless her life was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sydney!&quot; Called her boss, human but strong enough to beat her in an arm wrestling match, <br />
&quot;Two cuts of sirloin!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; She called back. <br />
<br />
At the same time Amy observed the images of the two missing Shinto statues, a thought <br />
occurred to her to add -something- to her monotone existence.  'Maybe I should visit the <br />
manor... none of the young pups are old enough to remember father, and none of the <br />
teenagers are likely to recognize me as one of father's pups, and the older ones... I guess <br />
I'll just take my chances.' She thought, and short of expendable-zombie-slave, she wished <br />
for some purpose, any purpose, besides the one she had now. <br />

<br />
Trevor sat on a bench with his sister Sabrina &quot;Nala&quot; with a couple of their friends, boys on <br />
one side, girls on the other, both sides curious about what Trevor had in his hot little <br />
hands. More of the playground equipment was suited for Leomans than yesterday, given <br />
the increase in Leoman to Human students in the grade-school from yesterday. <br />
<br />
Friends transformed friends who transformed siblings who transformed their friends, this <br />
sadly had the inescapable and harsh and unforgiving side effect of meaning that those not <br />
transformed into leoman were the ones with no friends or family that they cared for. <br />
<br />
Trevor opened the letter that had finally made to Trevor's family yesterday, and now the <br />
little boy during recess finally had the time and curiosity to open it. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything returned to normal the witches had touched with their magic? Everything?&quot; <br />
Maddex's heads asked figuring that was too much to hope for and REALLY wanting to get <br />
away from the topic of 'death' Marie-Eliza had just brought up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only the things the witches themselves had not personally handled and instead had done <br />
through the 'blanket spell' they had covered Glendale with. This included the majority of <br />
age regressions on the general populace and mutations of plants and livestock.  But the <br />
flowers for example by pollinating had become a natural part of the world. But they were <br />
seen as a reminder of the witches and exterminated within Glendale's city limits, and those <br />
that managed to spread outside the city limits died when magic in the rest of the world <br />
began to flow solely to Glendale to feed the game. <br />
<br />
For another example, the former mob members had all developed unique and individual <br />
identities during their time as children, and thus had cemented their place in existence, <br />
while their birth was magical, their behavior in of itself was not and completely their own,  <br />
much like Joella's.   What the witches saw as 'inferiority' was really that the infinite chaos <br />
had not driven them insane or made them loose touch with reality. If the witches had not <br />
been insane themselves by this point, they would have seen the former mob members and <br />
Samantha and Alissa as a vast improvement over the inflicted children.  The former mob <br />
children might have been considered odd by some, but were in no way unable to live a <br />
normal life unaided once they reached adulthood.&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty said, &quot;You said before Marie Cruz would figure out that Joella hadn't always been <br />
Joella, but didn't try to 'cure' her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no cure for who you are. Restoring her to normal would be just another murder <br />
someone who was alive to resurrect someone else who was dead.  Not all of Marie's <br />
companions agreed with her decisions.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August 10th 11:58 AM<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz remembered, Abraha, no, Abaza. The look in his eyes that had gone <br />
systematically gone from defiance, anger, hatred, and then finally fear as she had <br />
methodically extracted any information regarding any fellow Turk infiltrators out of him (in <br />
the presence of a watchful priest of course, she wasn't a savage after all). <br />
<br />
 She remembered the horror and betrayal she felt when she had finally seen his real self <br />
behind the mask of Abraham.  She remembered the temptation she had felt to disregard <br />
the very precise restrictions handed down by the Inquisition on what could and what could <br />
NOT be done to prisoners.   Finding out he had been charming Zoey, and Kathrine, and a <br />
leoman nun who worked in the records at the same time to collect his 'three virgins' hadn't <br />
help her self control. <br />
<br />
Rosa asked before the four allies departed to keep their heads down, &quot;You never answered <br />
my question. What Pride are you with? I've never seen a leoman like you, and why do you <br />
cover yourself like you were a human?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a leoman, I'm a felman.&quot; Kathrine had the very strong suspicion that she was going <br />
to be saying that a lot in the next few hours of screaming, confusion and havoc. She <br />
looked at the spear in her hands, knowing it would likely taste blood of mortal Men, <br />
Women and Children for the first time rather than the ichor of tentacled abominations from <br />
beyond. <br />
<br />
Of course neither Marie or Kathrine were wearing their nun attires, it would be wrong and <br />
impractical to be dressed as such for this task. Kathrine, the Nun NOT a part of the <br />
infamous Inquisition, was certain The Lord would allow their actions in spite of their vows. <br />
<br />
Draco likewise was not wearing his priestly robes, he doubted there would be any converts <br />
today least the five of them ended up just five more enslaved puppets for the witches' <br />
amusement. <br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Rosa asked to Kathrine's answer of her species.<br />
<br />
Kathrine sighed, normally she'd have loved to talk about her kind, &quot;I promise to explain in <br />
greater detail once the witches are dealt with but please go now!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh looked at the witches grounds, fill with terrors and wonders, and most <br />
importantly, her sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mal'Akh?&quot; Marie Cruz asked, &quot;Please don't tell me you want to go in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do... but... I'm so afraid...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing wrong with being afraid Mal'Akh.  And I lost this eye because I was a child <br />
who thought she was a warrior. It's -alright- to be a child... &quot; Marie Cruz really, -really- <br />
wished she had gotten to know more Leomans better, then maybe she'd be more able to <br />
tell females of the same coloring and age apart.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Promise me you won't hurt my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz shuddered. She looked away. &quot;I've promised I'd bring her back.&quot; <br />
<br />
She then ignored the scared cub as she was dragged away by Rosa with Monica close <br />
behind, Omega-Winifred had already left the hunters to their fate, eager to be aside her <br />
twin again. <br />
<br />
Marie spoke to the hunters, &quot;Remember, we're an invading army, not a a small ground of <br />
raiders. We have to keep that illusion up as long as possible! We have to come in through <br />
more than one way if possible.&quot; <br />
<br />
Linus said, &quot;That only have that opening because they WANT us to take it, be bottlenecked, <br />
and slaughtered like sheep.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Which means,&quot; Marie Cruz said, &quot;We blast or cut a hole through the thorns, as a <br />
distraction, which one of us gets their attention. Then one of us goes through the hole <br />
they've left us. Then we cut or blast a THIRD hole if possible and the remainder enter <br />
through that. REMEMBER these horns are magic, and they might be able to 'heal up' from <br />
the holes we make instantly, if that happened if the first hope we make, we'll use what's <br />
left of our blast powder on the hole they've left us and move in their one moment of <br />
surprise, which is all we're going to get.  Vadican, you can't fly with that broken wing, can <br />
still you match the witch's gargoyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do your part Marie, leave my part to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Dawn, Frank's old prime-mate, Twilight, along with the human Benjamin, and other <br />
lioness' named Daye, Night, and Dusk were assigned to act as melee guardians to the child <br />
familiars (but these were hardly the only lionesses under the witches control), including <br />
Rosalie, Gloria, Ashton, Grace, Donna, Cody, Chadwick, Rouge, Canary, Jimmy, Oliver, <br />
Oceana, Becky, Samantha and Alissa, their own cubs, and the two lupman pups; as lady <br />
leomans were expected to do. <br />
<br />
The town's folk so fogged by the witches magic that they saw Meranda's death as due to <br />
the hunters rather than mauled by a bear as they were told. <br />
<br />
As for the child familiars themselves, were eager when they were told they would avenge <br />
Meranda's death. Like Free and the Leomans, the child familiars were instructed to fight to <br />
the death if need be. <br />
<br />
 While the males did what was their duty to protect their territory from direct danger and <br />
enemies. Yes, plural, not singular. <br />
<br />
After Frank's death, the Witch Pride had been left with only one male, Mondain Renard. <br />
That had since changed. <br />
<br />
One had been a pudgy fast talking 'home remedies' saleman named Earl The Great who <br />
afterwards had begun to travel around but instead selling the idea of 'visiting' Glendale. <br />
<br />
Ten young and strong female leomas stood at attention with her legs together and their <br />
arms at their sides, her eyes looking straight ahead and their expressions empty.<br />
<br />
The witches had many flaws, but sexist had never been one of them.  Earlier, Gomorrah <br />
walked with a short black haired girl in a simplistic beige gray tunic named Pollyanna in <br />
one hand, and a blond long haired boy named Edgar in elaborate party clothes the other. <br />
<br />
The female leoman grew from nine teen tall, to eleven feet tall, their muscle mass <br />
increased several fold to make even a traditional leoman shudder. A mall of black or blond <br />
hair grew around their faces as a mane. Their practical, equally sized breasts (as most <br />
leoman females were) receded into their bodies.  Then their woman hood inverted and <br />
became sheathed packaged sealing their stature now as men, complete with the new <br />
purpose of being on the next line of defense. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are of the Witch Pride.&quot; The ten lion men growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To serve the Chaos Coven in all things, and protect the free future.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what is this secondary to?&quot;<br />
<br />
They all roared, &quot;--Nothing!--&quot; Pollyanna and Edgar clapped and cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; <br />
<br />
They all knelt down and bowed their heads to her.  She didn't bother to ask their names. <br />
What did it matter? Many or most of them had been men before their changes anyway, and <br />
names didn't matter as long as they fought and won. <br />
<br />
Twilight and Dawn however, were already thinking about asking the names of these <br />
leomans, along with the many, many other lionesses, and were curious as to why they <br />
hadn't done so before. <br />
<br />
Twilight already mentally picked out the one she would ask to be her new Prime Mate once <br />
the battle was won, she hoped Dawn would approve of him too.  The lionesses in their <br />
pre-battle chatter discussed which leomans they thought looked the most handsome and <br />
how they would propose as the remaining females were assigned to guard the house <br />
interior. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
The explosion was nearly deafening. And the witches knew the enemy was at their second <br />
ring of defenses, but the leoman and Free were waiting with more than one unpleasant <br />
surprise for these dogs of god. <br />
<br />
And the ring of thorns like the boxing trees before it, wondering why it had been made to <br />
feel to pain! First for the first time in it's left it felt pain as a tiny cut was made in itself, <br />
then it TRUELY knew pain as a explosion tore a hole it, with the edges of the blast still <br />
stinging in agony, and the ring of thorns never having before knowing pain, was <br />
distracted. <br />
<br />
And for the first time it perceived it had failed in it's duty as it felt invaders through <br />
through it.</p>
