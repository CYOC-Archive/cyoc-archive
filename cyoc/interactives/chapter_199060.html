<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew watched as the wheels spun around and around, eventually landing on four tiles,<br />
‘Female’<br />
Not really understanding the concept, Andrew just kept watching,<br />
‘Taller’<br />
Weird, he still didn’t really understand it,<br />
‘Bimbo’<br />
This thing had to just be picking random words right? He looked at the final tile and it read,<br />
‘7’<br />
<br />
“What a weird machine, guess I’m not getting that quarter back. Maybe some of thE—Ese games… will be…” Andrew suddenly cracked in his voice. He put his hand on his neck, feeling it. Whether he admitted it or not, that was a really strange thing, “what just happened?” He said to himself. He couldn’t help but think he was losing his voice, it sounded higher, but it felt lighter, “hello?” He said to himself, testing it. It was like every time he spoke it was getting even higher, “this has got to be some kind of jO-Oke! What the hell!” He said quite loud, hearing his voice crack like a glowstick, “what is going on!?” He exclaimed, “I sound like a girl!” Then he looked at his arms. He was wearing a somewhat loose t-shirt, which draped over his fairly thin frame. His arms, which were once covered with light hair were suddenly hairless!<br />
“Huh!” He shouted. He turned around, seeing a door to a bathroom nearby. He quickly ran into it, closing the door behind him, he even locked it. The bathroom was pretty clean, but he’d accidentally run into the womens half! “Whatever,” he said, knowing he’d already locked it. No one else was anywhere near this part of the arcade so who cared.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror. His arms were hairless, and he looked at his face, it was so much softer, much more feminine. He was starting to have a horrible fear inside of him. He looked at his legs under his shorts, they were getting even more dainty, like a girl. His feet had shrunk as well, his shoes feeling really free inside of his shoes,<br />
“This can’t be happening!!” He shouted, looking at his face, seeing his features become more and more feminine as the moments passed. He then remembered that if he was suddenly becoming a girl… that meant… “NO!” He shouted, pulling his shorts and staring at his now tiny penis, slowly but surely shrinking into his crotch, being replaced by a slit he could only assume was a vagina, “NO! PLEASE!!” He screamed. His pride and joy, the one thing that kept his company, his cock, was gone. He was anxious about touching it.<br />
Without realising it, he felt his shorts getting tighter, he looked at himself in the mirror. His hips were widening slightly, not exaggeratingly, but noticeable during the change.<br />
Andrew knew the next change… he lifted up his shirt and stared as his nipples got harder and bigger. Not long after, his chest began to rise like dough in an oven. He watched as he grew cup size after cup size, his breasts growing until they stuck out enough to be noticeable. They weren’t gigantic or anything, but you’d see them… especially with his hand nipples,<br />
“NO!” Andrew shouted, “NO!” He shouted again, “THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING!!” He screamed in horror, cupping his breasts. He let out a breath of pleasure, which made him quickly let go of his breasts for, “h-how did this…” he suddenly realised, “that damn game… I’m gonna BREAK IT!” He shouted, angrily. He headed for the door of the bathroom, reaching for the lock… but something was off…<br />
<br />
“Why is the… oh no…” he said. The lock to the door was further down. He quickly rushed back to the mirror and realised he was getting taller! “So it’s all coming true!” He exclaimed, “Why is hell is this happening to me!?” He cursed.<br />
He stared at his reflection as his feminine body got taller, stretching his torso. His breasts held his baggy shirt up, causing his torso lengthening to expose his midriff. His legs got together in his stretching shorts. Before too long, he felt the change stopping. He looked at himself in the mirror. He could see his face, but couldn’t see the top of his head.<br />
He started at the height of 5’8”, he wasn’t the tallest guy, he wasn’t short. Now he was somewhere around 6’7”… he was the tallest woman he’d ever seen. Heck, maybe even the tallest person he’d ever seen.<br />
<br />
“Wait… what does Bimbo mean?” He asked himself. Which was answered almost poetically as he looked at his hands.<br />
His previously short nails begun to grow and colour themselves pink. He watched as they grew to just under an inch in length, “how they hell am I gonna manage with these!?” He exclaimed. His complain was followed swiftly as he looked at his face. His eyelashes suddenly grew longer and longer, looking much faker than he would’ve liked, but before he could make another witty comment, his eyelashes were followed by his lips plumping bigger and bigger, looking like someone had stuck two thumbs onto his lips. They suddenly coloured pink, along with a barrage of makeup applied to his face. His face also looked a lot more made-up in age… he looked much more mature, not milf-level, but definitely more than he would’ve liked.<br />
<br />
“This is like, too crazy!” He said, not noticing his odd dialect change. He looked at his short hair, watching as it’s brown turned to blonde suddenly, growing longer and longer down his back. He looked at it, it was almost shiny with how much bleach was put into it.<br />
He was looking at his long locks and almost missed the pressure in his butt. Out of nowhere, he watched his hips widen, his thighs thicken, and his butt grow until it looked like a stereotypical bubble butt. His shorts were very tight, he felt it squishing against his much more sensitive genitalia.<br />
Andrew was straight, and he liked sexy women. Even he was attracted to his own ass. He placed his hand on it and squeezed… he’d never touched a girls butt before, but something about it felt real, it felt natural to him. He had a perfect natural ass.<br />
<br />
Andrew was so busy with his ass, that he didn’t notice the sudden rising of his chest. He looked at his tight shirt getting tighter and tighter around his suddenly swelling globes. He couldn’t believe it, his breasts were going from average, to big, to bigger, to huge! And they were still growing. His breasts got so large that they started peeping out from under his shirt. If his nipples weren’t so large (and hard) his shirt could’ve been mistaken for a bra with his they sat on his chest. His shirt tore, exposing a huge display of his brand new cleavage. The breasts finally stopped. They were incredibly large, somewhere between cantaloupes and melons… he couldn’t believe it. He’d not only turned into a girl, not only gotten taller, but turned into a tall sexy bimbo woman who looked like she’d come straight from a reality tv show! The final cherry on the cake was Andrews waist suddenly shrinking dramatically, making him look like a total supermodel.<br />
<br />
He didn’t know what to do.<br />
Reaching down, trying to see with his huge melons in the way, he managed to walk back over to the machine. No one else was around still. He realised he had only one choice…</p>
