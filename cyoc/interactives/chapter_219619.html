<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was still a boy. Just one who happened to have constructed female genitalia. That thought brought him back to reality. No matter how strong he tried to pretend to be, no matter how many self-affirmations he recited, it still hurt.<br />
<br />
He picked up the bag of dilators and stared down at them, unsure of what he should do. Slowly pulling the one he had been using out of his new pussy and holding it up to the light, he realized that there was no  denying it any longer. This was his pussy. All these years he had been fucking girls with this kind of stuff inside them, while thinking  he was doing them a favor.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly shut off the lamp and walked over to the window and pulled back the curtains. He stood there naked, staring out at the moonlit sky, watching as the stars twinkled through the gap in the trees beyond the yard. He watched a shooting star dart across the sky and smiled for the first time in a week as it burned out against the black backdrop of space.<br />
<br />
Eventually he turned around and walked towards the bed. He undressed and crawled under the covers, curling up into a ball, hugging his pillow close to his chest.  Soon he fell asleep, exhausted and mentally drained from all the stress.<br />
<br />
Morning found him lying awake, staring blankly up at the ceiling. He wasn&#39;t sure if he was ready to dilate or if he was expected to go back to school today. His new pussy ached when he sat up. Jeff knew vaginoplasty was a big deal surgery, but this soreness went far beyond anything he had imagined. Eventually he forced himself to get up and take a look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He had done quite well for himself. His new pussy would have looked beautiful, on a girl. There was no doubt about it. But a shaved cunt looked alien on his hairy muscular quarterback body, or so he thought. His pussy twitched at the sight of his own modified body, somehow arousing but new and terrifying. He winced involuntarily as he spread his legs to take a closer look.  There was a distinct ridge where the foreskin once covered his now nonexistent cockhead, but not nearly enough of it to cover the entire length of the labia. His newly built vagina appeared pretty tight, and was definitely going to need some time to stretch out before he could even think about exploring his new parts properly. It seemed as though his enlarged clit was making up for lost ground, though. Jeff rubbed the rough pink area gently and could feel the increased sensitivity. He couldn&#39;t help but notice that he was slightly erect, or at least it felt like it. Warmth and tightness radiated from the area above his canal. Weird. After rubbing the fleshy bulge around his new clitoris for a while, Jeff grabbed his laptop and sat down on the edge of his bed. As he was looking up information on the procedure and recovery, he realized that he was already more aroused than usual, even just by simply looking at pictures of the before and after. He also couldn&#39;t help but notice that it was getting difficult to concentrate on what he was reading. All too soon he gave up on reading and started searching porn instead. Finding one of his favorite sites, he eagerly scrolled through the listings until he came upon an erotic story called &quot;Drew&#39;s Secret.&quot; Jeff always thought he was mostly straight but he was never too sure, and it’s not like his masculinity could be hurt any more. It had been almost a week since the transformation and he wanted to see how his newly made pussy reacted to seeing another man, a handsome, muscled guy who worked as a personal trainer. Without hesitating he pressed play.<br />
<br />
Jeff was hooked almost instantly. The video played out in typical internet fashion, slowly building anticipation as the main character masturbated in his office chair and the narrator spoke softly about how he would love to fuck Drew and wondered if he&#39;d ever get the chance. Before long they were fully undressing each other and Drew was unzipping his pants and dropping his underwear to the floor. Jeff nearly jumped out of his skin when he saw. Drew was a trans man, that was his “secret”, he looked just like Jeff did only much better. Drew bent forward and showed off his hairy cunt from behind, beckoning the other man to come over.  Jeff gulped. Then without warning Drew pushed himself backwards, placing his hands firmly on the other man’s hips and spreading his legs wide open, taking all 7 inches inside. Jeff could hear Drew’s breath quicken as he gazed lovingly at his beautiful stretched out pussy, but the image that really sent him over the edge was Drew’s face. It was ecstatic, absolutely drenched in pleasure. This guy, whom Jeff could have easily mistaken for a supermodel, was finally getting fucked and enjoying every second of it.<br />
<br />
The video was very hot, but unfortunately ended too soon. Jeff laid back on his bed with his legs spread.What the hell? Suddenly Jeff heard a knock on his bedroom door. It was probably Lisa coming to check on him, but with his luck, maybe it was one of his friends from football team coming to get him for practice. He held his breath, wondering whether to answer the door or pretend he was still asleep. In the end he decided that being rude wouldn&#39;t help his situation. He pulled his pajama bottoms up and opened the door a crack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey there,&quot; Lisa said. She didn&#39;t sound surprised to find him sitting on the bed in nothing but pajamas. He quickly shut the door behind her. &quot;You&#39;re up early,&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; he replied. &quot;I guess I&#39;m just excited for class.&quot; &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s understandable.&quot; She leaned against the door frame, peeking in. &quot;How are you feeling? You know I’m proud of you taking this step, right?” Jeff blushed out of embarrassment, apparently at least his family knew about his new sex, he didn’t even want to know who else.  &quot;I-I appreciate your support Lisa. Uh, but, what exactly do you mean?&quot; He didn&#39;t quite know how to phrase his question, because he didn’t really know what she knew.  Or didn’t know. Either way he knew that this was bound to be awkward. Lisa, realizing he wasn’t going to ask outright, explained: &quot;Huh? We both know you went through hell to get those… ahem… changes? So of course I’m proud of you! Don’t tell me I’m the only person here that knows that. Hell, everyone on campus is talking about you!&quot; Jeff&#39;s face turned redder by the minute. &quot;So when are you gonna go out and find Prince Charming? Got your eyes on anyone? He must be pretty damn hot if my little brother is gonna go through hell to take such a big dick,&quot; Lisa teased. Jeff blushed again.<br />
<br />
Oh god. This was awful. What should he say? Did he need to start dating now? How does this work? Suddenly a question occurred to him: How would people react to seeing him naked?  Would they be disgusted? Envious? Jealous? Relieved? Afraid? None of these were good options. But wait. Did he need to hide? Maybe hiding was the wrong choice. Lisa could tell something was up. “Oh please, you’re the talk of the town, everyone wants a piece of that. You know authenticity is attractive, and who’s more real than you? Anyway, mom actually sent me up here to ask if you’re going to school today.”</p>
