<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You point the key at Keith and push the unlock button. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure how it works, but I guess I can&#39;t make it any worse, you think as Keith begins to change again.<br />
<br />
You hear Keith whinny, as his back begins to crack. He stumbles a little, as his front hooves begin to change. His front hooves split, forming again his human hands. His legs shift, and he slowly stands on his feet again. His swollen abdomen deflates, becoming flat like it used to be. His barrel chest contracts while the bulging pecs dissappear inside. He was slowly turning back to normal, however you soon realize that he&#39;s still naked. His snout recedes into his mouth, and his whinnies become recognizable human words and grunts. The fur on him turns into his regular body hair and, lastly, his equine genitals deflate into human&#39;s. Keith is back a man but now he&#39;s still nude in the middle of the park.<br />
<br />
Keith looks at his body in a mix of happiness and angry, twisting around to see his front and his back. You stare at him in awed silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, man? Why did you turn me into a horse? And where are my fucking clothes?&quot; says Keith. His voice denotes how upset he was while he was covering his nudity with his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried. I am not sure how it works. But hey - at least you&#39;re human again. We can go to my car and find a way to...&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Keith interrupts you with a yell while he storms over to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that! &quot; says Keith angrily, as he grabs the key from you. Standing close to you, you can see he&#39;s shaking maybe because of the embarrassment he was feeling. He&#39;s still stunk so bad, result of his poor hygiene and sweat. You decide it is better to let him try to fix himself. But he stares at the device with confusion. <br />
<br />
You wait patiently for him to give up, and return the device to you. Keith was so focused on it that he forgot to cover himself and you can see his veiny dick and balls bouncing between his legs.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but laugh. &quot;Maybe you should keep covering yourself!&quot; you say, and immediately regret it.<br />
<br />
Keith glares at you angrily. &quot;You think this is funny? Let&#39;s see how you like it!&quot; says Keith, as he points the key at you and presses the unlock button.<br />
<br />
You feel an electric buzz before your clothes begin to vanish. Your shoes disintegrate in the air closely followed by your socks and now you can feel the hot concrete with your feet. The vanishing moved upward through your pants but skips your underwear momentarily. Your shirt dissappear instead, beginning from your abdomen and moving to your sleeves. Even your watch and the small necklace you had vanished before it&#39;s your boxers&#39; turn. It happens so fast that you can just stare at the last fabric on you disintegrating in the air and exposing your own privates.<br />
<br />
Oh, shit! You think as you feel the cold air touching your dick. You immediately covered yourself and realize how embarrassed must Keith be.<br />
<br />
You stare at him for a moment before he starts to laugh at you like you did at him before. You know that it&#39;s your chance to recover your key and you quickly make a move to take it from his hands. However, he reacts immediately and fights back to take it back. Now you both forget to cover yourself while you fight to own the key.<br />
<br />
During the wrestling, one of you mistakenly pushes the key&#39;s button and it quickly changes you both. Keith seems familiar to it but you are struggling with being a horse. Unable to use your arms, you use your necks and whole bodies to take dominance over the other one while the key now lays on the ground.<br />
<br />
Keith manages to push you back and take the key with hid teeth. He tries to use it and he shoots you with it. You feel weird while you turn back to normal but when you&#39;re human again you take the key from Keith&#39;s mouth and use it on him. He also turns back to normal, however you&#39;re still naked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Truce&#39; He says while he gasps and you agree. It seems that the device is on loop between horse and human and you must figure it out how to change it. However, you must find a place to hide because your naked and subsequent horse fight is getting attention from some people in the park.<br />
<br />
&#39;We can stay here! We must run!&#39; You say  but before you give a step. Keith takes the key and uses it to turn you into a horse again. You are going to charge against him but you see that he points at himself with the key and uses it to turn into a horse too. You stared at him confused for a second but you see that he takes the key with his mouth and starts to run and makes a gesture to you to follow him. So, you both begin to run as horses through the streets, obviously some people stared at you bewildered, but it was better than laughing at you by running naked. <br />
<br />
A cop siren begins to sound and you immediately realize that you must hide somewhere before you&#39;re chased by the police. Keith must think the same because he guides you to a school backyard where you can be safe for a while. He uses the key on you and when you turn back to normal you use it on him too.<br />
<br />
&#39;That wasn&#39;t the best idea but at least we&#39;re not naked in the middle of the park.&#39; Keith says while he grins at you. For some reason you don&#39;t care anymore about looking at his nudity as he surely don&#39;t care about yours either. You look around and see that the school is empty but before you can think on a plan, Keith enters the building. You sigh and go after him, maybe there could be clothing that fits you in there.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey, I go to pee.&#39; You tell Keith while you find the restrooms.<br />
&#39;Ok.&#39; He replies before he uses the keys on you and you become a horse again. &#39;You made fun of me before, pissing like a racehorse, remember? So it&#39;s fair you do the same.&#39;<br />
<br />
At first, you thinks it&#39;s ridiculous but then you figure out that it&#39;s better than fighting with Keith again. So, you walk through the men restroom and when you&#39;re in front of an urinal you unfold your horse dick and piss like a race horse too. It&#39;s really hard to stay in balance in two legs while you piss but you manage to do it without making a big mess around. Now that you have finished you wonder how to put your dick back inside you. You don&#39;t know how to do it and decide to find Keith instead, so he can turn you back to human.<br />
<br />
Walking with your equine shaft bouncing below you feels even weirder than being a horse and you wish to find Keith quickly. You find him in the teacher&#39;s lounge unsuccessfully looking for some clothes. He hears you coming and smirks when he sees the dangling shaft you&#39;re sporting. He uses the keys on you again and you become human. Then, he asks you to help him because he has been looking for clothes for a while but he has just found kids clothing.<br />
<br />
You look at the keys that Keith has left on a desk next to some kids shirts with cartoons characters. You think about the troubles that those keys have given to you and absent-mindedly push the device which is pointing at Keith. A blinding flash surrounds you for a second before you see a 6 years old boy instead of your messy friend. He is still naked but he looks way more clean and nice without that pungent odor and sweaty body hair.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey!&#39; He yells at you but before he could yell any more, you use the keys on yourself and turn into a 6 years old version of yourself. You grin at him and begin to wear the clothes on the desk, Keith immediately figures out your intentions and does the same. You saw him wearing a SpongeBob t-shirt and blue shorts while you&#39;re wearing a Ben 10&#39;s one and green pants. You smile at each other,  take the keys and leave the school. You&#39;re too far from your houses or the park where you left the car but at least you&#39;re not naked anymore.</p>
