<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie, Merlin, Baba, And there friends now pulled up to the entrance of Circe&#39;s amusement park. Kellie had texted Jack before they left and now anxiously awaited his arrival. Kellie fidgeted slightly as she wAited for him to arrive, she still had no idea how she was going to explain this to Jack. As Jack now pulled up with Sebastian in tow she waved him over. “So what’s going on,” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Long story,” Kellie sighed. “By the way where are Ayami and Rexie?”<br />
<br />
“They’re watching Mia and Zack,” Jack said. “Apparently they wanted to keep a close on the the two of them. They’re supposed to be meeting up with Gloria, apparently Jason and Lisa are taking the kids to the park.”<br />
<br />
“Is Lisa going to be okay,” Katie asked anxiously. <br />
<br />
“Nothing is going to happen,” Jack assured her. “Remember we have a peace treaty right now. No one is going to do any harm against any one of us.”<br />
<br />
Kellie groaned, glancing over at the young Baba Yaga. She wasn’t quite sure how Jack would take her actions against his mother. “About that,” she said sheepishly. “You should probably talk with Baba over there.” Jack looked confused as he gazed at the young woman. “Baba what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” she blushed. “Your mother and Circe were starting to worry me. I kind of used the hourglass on the two of them.”<br />
<br />
“What,” Jack yelled. “What the hell Baba! Do you know how dangerous that thing can be.”<br />
<br />
“What is the hourglass,” Sebastian asked.<br />
<br />
Jack sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Basically the hourglass is an ancient time item,” he groaned. “Think of it like the Ring of Age only much, much stronger. It also happens to be wildly unpredictable, which is why Baba, Circe and my mother always warned me not to use it!”<br />
<br />
“Do as I say not as I do,” Bab said flippantly causing Jack go red with anger. Kellie now quickly grabbed her former lover, yanking him backwards as she tried to get him to focus. “Look how’s not the time,” she said. “Right now your mom and Circe are 6 years old and in a amusement park all by themselves. I’m sure you realize that even though they’re immensely powerful we shouldn’t let two 6 year old kids run around unsupervised.”<br />
<br />
Jack sighed, agreeing with Kellie as they now entered the park. As they did Kellie looked around and immediately began to worry. There were far more anthro people around than her previous visit. These anthros were much different from her last visit though. The anthro creatures walking around the park looked demonic, fiendish with features that were truly monstrous. Before the anthro people appeared to be humanoid animal people. Their features were animalistic yes but you could still see they had been human. The ones now mixing with them though contained no humanity whatsoever. These anthros looked like creatures of legend like the Minotaur, animal features crafted onto monsters that were quite frightening. <br />
<br />
“Umm anyone know what happened,” Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
“It appears Lilith and Circe have joined forces,” he said softly. “Lilith has begun transforming her demons into anthro creatures.”<br />
<br />
Kellie shuddered, demons that were loyal to both Circe and Lilith? If that were the case did that mean Circes followers would now become demons? If that were the case the armies they controlled would be unstoppable, it also meant that Kellie would need to train the rest of her friends in magic. As she now turned towards Baba Yaga to talk, she paused. Baba’s dress looked slightly loose around her hips, while her face appeared fresher than when they had arrived. If Kellie were to guess the witch looked closer to 26 than 30. <br />
<br />
“Baba look,” she yelled.<br />
<br />
Baba gave Kellie a confused look before glancing in a nearby mirror. “Damn,” she sighed. “It appears the hourglass is still affecting me.”<br />
<br />
“Wait the hourglass is affecting you too,” Jack exclaimed. Baba could only nod sheepishly. “It was an unintended side effect,” she stated. “I had hoped to avoid this..complication but unfortunately it appears the hourglass was more chaotic than I anticipated.”<br />
<br />
“Has your magic been affected,” Merlin asked, slightly concerned. “No,” she stated. “I still have complete control over my magic. I do worry though about what may have happened with Circe and Lilith. I find it highly improbable that they would join forces considering the mutual dislike they had for one another not long ago.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she glanced first at her friends then at Jack. “We better go find your mom,” she said. “Before things get even more out of hand.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” he stated. “So how do we find them?”<br />
<br />
Kellie now looked over the fairgrounds, smiling as she recognized one of the anthros. “I know just who to ask.”<br />
<br />
Franklin appeared slightly befuddled as he observed the demon anthros and the other anthro people mingle around the park. Despite the demons monstrous appearance they seemed to be getting along rather well with Circes followers. Franklin though was practical and needed to anticipate the worst case scenarios. If the demons were to ever turn on any of them, their would be no way to stop them. Hearing someone calling his name he turned, sighing in relief. “Kellie what an unexpected but welcome surprise.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah good to see you too Franklin,” she smirked. “Can you tell me what in the world is going on here?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” he started. “It appears my goddess is....reliving her youth. Apparently she and Lilith are enjoying a...um...play date.”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s, unexpected,” Kellie mumbled. “Did you notice anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Well they were both acting rather odd,” he said. “If didn’t know any better I would of thought they were actually children.”<br />
<br />
“It appears the hourglass has completely transformed the two of them into innocent 6 year old children,” Merlin stated as he rubbed his chin.<br />
<br />
“Yeah magical children with more magic than you can imagine,” Katie said dryly. “Anyone have any ideas on what to do?” Kellie now rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she tried to think.</p>
