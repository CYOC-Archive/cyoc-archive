<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You continued to gallop deeper into the forest, until you suddenly heard another voice coming from nearby: “there they are, come on boy we’ve almost got them!”<br />
<br />
You and Jessica both looked back to see another horse and rider approaching you from behind. You felt a chill run up your spine when you realised that it was Vicky that was bearing down on you. However, your anxiety grew tenfold when you recognised her mount as well. It was Harry, the same stallion that had given you this cursed body in the first place!<br />
<br />
Seeing this gave you a rush of adrenaline as you raced away at an even faster pace. However, you could sense that Harry was slowly gaining ground as his reputation as the Stable’s most prized equine specimen seemed to be well-founded. Before long he had closed to within 50 meters, while you could feel yourself beginning to tire.<br />
<br />
Upon sensing that you were struggling, Jessica did her best to encourage you. However, despite her best efforts she couldn’t change the fact that you were still not fully-used to your new body. As a result, you could feel yourself beginning to slow as your muscles burned and each breath came out as a loud, exhausted wheeze.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of the chase, you knew your time would soon be up. With this in mind you moved to plan B, and desperately prayed for a happy outcome…<br />
<br />
Jessica cried out in surprise as you suddenly turned around and reared-up, sending her crashing to the floor. She quickly jumped up and shot you a look that you translated as ‘what the fuck are you doing!?’ However, she seemed to understand what you were planning as you motioned for her to keep moving.<br />
<br />
“Baby no! You can’t give up like this.” However, you had already made up your mind as you turned to face the approaching stallion. You looked back and whinnied a ‘goodbye’ to her before you moved back towards your pursuers. You then heard Jessica say “I love you baby” in a shaky voice before she started running barefoot away from you.<br />
<br />
Having sensed that this was the only realistic hope for escape that either of you had, you planted your hooves firmly in place and prepared to sacrifice yourself so that Jessica could get away. And so you stood there struggling to make peace with your decision as Harry and Vicky pulled up beside you.<br />
<br />
“I told you you needed to work on your fitness Princess! Glad to see that you’ve finally accepted your inevitable fate.” You pretended to look defeated as Vicky dismounted Harry and approached you with a rope in her hands. “I noticed that Jessica has already reverted back to her old self. A pity to lose such a fine broodmare, but I’m sure you’ll be more than capable of making up for this loss.” You struggled to keep your cool as Vicky caressed your neck possessively. You wanted to get some sort of payback for all she had put you through, but for now you knew you had to stall the vile woman for as long as possible.<br />
<br />
Strangely, your hated equine body actually proved useful for the first time as you sensed an all-too-familiar heat beginning to rise to the surface. You could smell Harry’s strong musky scent invading your senses as he stood watching you nearby. It was obvious that he had noticed your arousal as he seemed to stare at you with a hungry expression on his face. <br />
<br />
As you noticed Harry’s interest in you, you reasoned that such a distraction would give Jessica the best possible chance of escape. You therefore started to subtly encourage the big stallion by turning your ass towards him and slowly raising your tail. In the meantime, you also kept Vicky entertained by licking her hand and whinnying along with her jokes, despite the fact that she was making them at your expense. It was shameful behaviour to be sure, but it was certainly effective as both Vicky and Harry lavished attention upon you.<br />
<br />
After a short time spent ridiculing you, Vicky finally turned her attention back to business. “Right then, let’s go and get that troublesome girlfriend of yours. Harry should easily be able to catch up to her, isn’t that right boy…”<br />
<br />
Vicky gasped when she saw the state Harry was in. You looked back and smiled to yourself when you saw the normally cool and composed horse staring at your ass with a feral, hungry look in his eyes. He seemed to be drooling in anticipation as you flashed him your pussy and wiggled your ass slightly. Given that you were in the height of your oestrus, there was now a steady stream of juices frothing from your swollen cunt as a dense wave of pheromones were wafted towards him by your swishing tail. It was obvious that Harry wanted you as his cock now stood fully to attention beneath him.<br />
<br />
“Harry!” Vicky said in an exasperated voice. “What has gotten into you?! You can deal with Princess later, but right now you have a job to do!”<br />
<br />
To your relief, Harry remained transfixed by you as his eyes appeared to glaze over. He barely seemed to even hear Vicky’s words as he instead took a step towards you.<br />
<br />
Now that you had him under your spell, you were determined not to let your hold on Harry slip away. To that end you looked back at the stallion and gave him the most seductive whinny you could. You also made a point of spreading your back legs slightly, ironically using Vicky’s own lessons against her as you enticed Harry like a professional. Before you knew what was happening you felt a warm pressure on your sensitive vagina as Harry started to lick at the source of his arousal.<br />
<br />
As Harry got into it you were quickly reminded of your first time with him. It was obvious that he had a great deal of experience with the ladies as he delicately ran his tongue over your vagina’s outer lips before occasionally sweeping right over the slit itself. In the meantime you felt your body temperature rising even higher as your mating instincts built in power. However, rather than fighting the urges you were actually encouraging them, allowing you to truly enjoy the experience; safe in the knowledge that it was all for a good cause.<br />
<br />
As Harry continued to eat you out, you couldn’t help noticing that Vicky was becoming increasingly flustered. After trying and failing to pull Harry away from you several times, the attendant was now attempting to tie you up to a nearby tree. As she did this you did your best to make things as awkward as possible and thus buy Jessica as much time as possible. <br />
<br />
Sadly Vicky was eventually able to use her skill and experience to secure you to the tree. Once she had done this she promptly took off after Jessica, muttering curses to herself as she went. Seeing the woman in such a state made you feel good, but you were still concerned that your stalling might not have been enough.<br />
<br />
However, you found it hard to dwell on this for too long once you felt Harry slowly slip his tongue inside you. You now knew it wouldn’t be long until you were a horse forever. It was an unfortunate way to go, but in that moment you just hoped your sacrifice had been worth it…</p>
