<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shawn had just finished downloading TransformaZone. It went much faster than he anticipated, and he didn't even have a chance to grab a drink before it was done. After logging in, Shawn started making his character. He had heard about the Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, and Supers settings, and was shocked to see there were many others. He couldn't decide on one, and randomly picked Pop Culture. Apparently, this was one for the kiddies, as it looked far more cartoony than the others. Shawn, decided to take advantage of this, and made his character look like the Sniper from Team Fortress 2. After creating his character, Shawn entered the game.<br />
<br />
The first place Shawn ended up was a beautifully rendered version of Main Street USA from Disney World. As he walked down the street, he noticed something odd. There were no quests. He started running around like a mad man trying to find an adventure. There were trainers, guards (the weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit), merchants, and dozens of other NPC's, but not a single quest giver. After a while, Shawn ended up at the end of Main Street. Finally, he found it. In the middle of the courtyard was a bronze statue of some kind of wizard holding the hand of what looked like Felix the Cat. Above it was a big glowing exclamation point. Shawn happily clicked and proceeded to read through the quest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brave adventurer, welcome to the land of cartoon, yada yada yada, princess, blah blah blah, Quest Rewards: 50 XP, 100 silver.&quot;<br />
<br />
'There we go,' Shawn thought, 'rescue the princess, gain a level, get rich.' Of course, when Shawn accepted the quest, things didn't work out the way he intended. He was sucked into his computer and trapped in a room that looked like the scrolling text from the Matrix. He wasn't sure if this was a glitch or a reference. Either way, he sure as hell wasn't supposed to be pulled into the game. No sooner had he thought of a &quot;witty&quot; quip about immersive gaming, then he started to transform. It wasn't as painful a process as years of werewolf movies would have made him believe. Instead it was just really tingly. He shrank at least a half foot, putting him somewhere around 5' 9,&quot; and his body hair fell out. Then the weird stuff started happening. His already skinny stomach flattened even more, while his hips and chest bulged outward. His hair grew and changed color to make him blond. His legs slendered and grew slightly, around an inch, until he looked like a model in a magazine. Unfortunately for Shawn, that magazine wasn't Abercrombie and Fitch, it was Victoria's Secret. After his physical transformation, Shawn's clothes changed as well. His jeans and t-shirt fused together and became a bright pink. Then his pants turned into the bottom of an incredibly long skirt, reaching down to his (or, more appropriately, her) ankles. Her sleeves slid back into her dress, which is what it clearly was at this point, revealing her dainty arms. Then the dress became detailed with golden lace sewn into a beautiful pattern all around it. Next, Shawn's underwear tightened around his recently formed pussy, but also grew much softer. In addition, it felt like the same fabric was now wrapped around her D cups. Not to leave a job undone, makeup and nail polish appeared on Shawn. Finally, Shawn felt a jolt of pain run through her torso as a corset materialized under her dress. Just when Shawn thought she was done, the clothes started ripping themselves apart. First the skirt of her dress tore severely, making it not even reach her knees. Then her bodice started to tear too, revealing the tight corset underneath. Next, her hair, became messy, some of it getting in her eyes. As she brushed it away, she saw that her fingernails had chipped away as well. She couldn't see it, but most of her makeup washed off too.<br />
<br />
After that traumatic experience, Shawn froze. The world around her started moving incredibly quickly, and she was soon back in the game world. This time though, she wasn't on Main Street. She had somehow transported to a castle somewhere, and the bars on the window seemed to indicate she wasn't a welcome guest. Confused, Shawn pulled up the quest log, which was no just a book that appeared from nowhere. She decided to read the quest in detail this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Objectives:<br />
              Kill Ogre (not complete)<br />
<br />
Brave adventurer, welcome to the land of cartoon. You have arrived just in time, as we are in dire need of help. Our fair princess has been captured by a malicious ogre in a far away land. We have found a way to bring her back, but cannot do so yet because the ogre will know she has gone. We need you to take her place in the tower the ogre has trapped her in. Then, we will be able to bring her home without the monster coming to reclaim her. Once you are there, you will have to kill the vile beast so that you can escape too. Only when the ogre has been killed and the princess is returned will you be able to return to your current form. You will be rewarded greatly for this, but it is a dangerous mission. Once you have slain the beast, go to the princess, and she will give you your reward.<br />
<br />
Quest Rewards: 50 XP, 100 silver, transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
This isn't going to be worth 50 XP.</p>
