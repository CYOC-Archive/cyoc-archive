<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The hotdog man runs as fast as he could to escape you, not knowing what you intended as well as freaked out from seeing you transform right in front of him. You just stand right where you are, knowing that he couldn't run forever and that he was more than likely going to hide, when he does hide that will be your time to strike. Even though you were massive, strong and super powerful, you didn't like hunting in the open. Smelling the air and the ground, you could smell the man still, taking in not only his manly scent, but the scent of fear and slight arousal. You knew then that this might be fun for you tonight.</br>
<br>Sniffing the air again, still where you transformed, you could tell that he was hiding now as his scent of fear had dwindled slightly. Still on your two legs, you drop down to all fours and run in the direction he went, continuously smelling the ground and following his manly scent. You followed it into the woods, where you could tell he had hoped to throw you off, knowing that there were several scents to mask his own there. He was right, in one sense, but not in the other. There were several things in the air; the smell of evening dew on the blades of grass, the smell of urine from dogs relieving themselves there, the smell of musk from several different animals left behind from mating not too long ago which stirs your still human shaped cock. Inwardly you smile, thanking him for this little treat before his inevitable infection.</br>
<br>Bringing yourself back to the task at hand, your mind sifting through the smells, keeping his at the forefront of your thoughts. Never really losing it, but indistinctive for a moment, you find it again and continue on your hunt. You can smell him stronger than before, which meant you were much closer to him as he probably stopped or slowed down to find a good hiding spot. Slowly you stalk through the woods, following him to a large hill and down into a huge storm drain. As you near the opening, you could hear his heartbeat race, his breathing still labored but quiet so not to attract you. You sheath your claws, retracting them into your thick furry fingers and toes, you then step into the opening softly, not wanting to catch his attention quite yet, wanting to block the only exit out of there so that there would be nowhere for him to run. Now that you were fully inside, with no way for him to escape, you stand upright and unsheathe your claws from both sets of paws. Walking slowly, you progress forward little by little, sharp and curled black claws tap ever so menacingly and loudly that he was sure to hear you coming. Creeping forward still, you could hear him now, trying to escape, muttering to himself about what a mistake it was to go down there. Slowly you continued until he was in your sight, holding a flashlight so he could see where he was going and know that he was now trapped. Looking past him, you see the cause of his muttering, the fool had forgot about the massive gate that separated the park from the outside world, keeping all it's inhabitants inside it's confines. You continue to walk toward him, at a normal pace now, until you were standing nearly chest to chest with the man. He gazed in terror at you, looking into your yellowed eyes, seeing you for the beast and nothing else. He tries to back away from you, not going anywhere with his back pressed up against the welded metal grate, but you stand there with what he thought was a smile on your face.</br>
<br>Still able to talk, you smile and lick your chops. "Well little man, it seems that you have an issue on your hands. I am going to give you a choice, I am not going to force your hand in anything, but there are benefits and downfalls to the decision you make. First, what is your name?"</br>
<br>The hotdog vendor was surprised by a few things. First, he was surprised that you could still speak. Second, was how deep your voice had become. Third and most astonishing of all to him, was the fact you were giving him a choice, but he was apprehensive because he didn't know what he was going to be able to choose from. Stuttering a bit from his fear, he tried to speak. "G... Ga... Gary."</br>
<br>"Excellent, my name is David. I really do hate not knowing who I am talking to. Now Gary, here are your choices. You can choose one of a few things. One to become infected by me and have total control over yourself. Two, you could choose not to become infected and I infect you anyway and turn you into my slave, bound to do what I want like a puppet. Three, you can choose neither of the two but accept my werewolf DNA into your genetics and any children you have from that point on will be male and become werewolves, like me, on their twenty first birthday. If you choose this option, they will have an urge, on their twenty-first birthday, to track me down and find me, this will be something you cannot stop because you will still be bound to me."</br>
<br>"Alright, what are the benefits to all the options above and what are their downfalls?"</br>
<br>"Option number one gives you immortality, never aging another day in your life, virility and insane sexual stamina, the ability to change into the beast like myself when you want outside of this park and a body no man or woman could resist. Downfalls to this would be being hungry more often for raw meats, constant desire for sex as some see this as a bad thing, never being able to die unlike what they show in movies with our kind dying from a silver bullet. Never dying can be bad because you will watch everyone around you grow old and die, unless of course you infect them. What you have seen or read is bullshit by the way. If we get shot with silver bullets, the silver just burns pretty bad and even if we get shot multiple times, our systems will expel the bullets, but we never die."</br>
<br>"What about being shot in the head? Wouldn't you die from that? Also, could I infect anyone I wanted?"</br>
<br>"Nope to both questions. First our skulls are twice as thick as humans, making it impervious and unbreakable. Second, Lycanthropy only affects men, women can never get it because their bodies kill it off immediately. Option number two gives you all of the benefits of being a werewolf as well as the downfalls. However it has one more downfall, the fact that you will have no will of your own. You would be like a puppet and I would be the puppeteer, having you do what I want, when I want and make you change when it would fit the need. Option number three gives you no benefit at all, except keeping your humanity with having insane virility and sexual stamina. The downfall to that is not having everything in option one and cursing your line with pure Lycanthropy, much like myself."</br>
<br>"So what happens if I choose option number three?"</br>
<br>"I bite you and instructing the DNA of the saliva only to affect your reproductive organs and then you would leave and I would go on about my business. About an hour later, you will feel the intense urge to mate with a female of your choice and spread the Lycanthropy, always acting as though you were going to wear a condom, but never do. Your sperm would always make it to the egg and fertilize it with xx sperm as that is all your body will produce. The child would appear normal throughout gestation, birth and life. As an added piece of info, even though women can't be infected, the child can be as it will be male and the child is separate from the mother even though he is in the womb. Her body wouldn't see the werewolf gene as bad because it's rooted in his genetic sequencing. Once the male is fully mature at age twenty one, he will track me down, never realizing how and why. I will fill him in on things, we will transform together and I will give him choices to make as I am giving them to you."</br>
<br>"Ok... that doesn't sound too bad... What is the story with you?"</br>
<br>"My father was given the same three choices I am giving you and he choose option number three. He didn't want to become a werewolf, but he didn't mind having all male children. What the previous werewolf didn't tell him was that his children would become pure blood werewolves on their twenty-first birthdays. On my twenty-first, which was not too long ago, I had the urge to walk but I had no end. I walked and walked till I reached a park where I found a man sitting on a bench in a secluded area. I felt as though I needed to speak with him, so I walked to his bench and sat down. It was then that I found out that I was a werewolf, that I would be changing soon for the first time as the full moon made it's way into the sky. I changed, liked this form you see me now in and I was given my options."</br>
<br>"Do you mind if I ask what those were?"</br>
<br>"Sure. He told me that no matter what, I would always do what I wanted because I didn't have an option to lose my will. My choice was to either be a part of his pack or make one of my own. I made the choice to make a pack of my own, as I have never been good at following orders from someone else. So there you have my story, now what do you choose?"</br>
<br>"One more question before I do though. What will happen if I choose option number one as number two is pretty much the same?"</br>
<br>"I will bite you, my DNA will infect you as it is, with no modifications and you will become just like me. Your fur will match your natural hair color, your muscles will be huge as you see on me, while your cock and balls will be just as big as mine are and your cock will remain human in shape. Now, no more stalling as there more people to give this choice to! What do you choose?"</br>
<br>"I choose..."</br></p>
