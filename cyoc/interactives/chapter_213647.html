<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think we need to get out of here.” said Greg as Amy nodded her head.<br />
<br />
Neither of them cared about leaving the pool side bar unattended at the moment, because literally all hell was breaking loss as the entire world around them was changing.<br />
<br />
Then it hit them. <br />
<br />
Neither of them had taken a step out of the bar before their legs snapped together at the ankle and they fell down onto the foam bar mat. <br />
<br />
However, the mat was gone and instead they were falling deeper into of all things salt water. They both came to a rest on a sandy bottom, but the sand was a pitch black mixed with red.<br />
<br />
“FUCK!” cursed Amy as she spoke outload underwater which caused both of them to blink in confusion. However, as they blinked both of their eyes turned a solid color and instead gave off a sickly green color in the case of Greg and a dark purple in Amy’s case.<br />
<br />
Both of them groaned as their bodies were wrecked by the change sweeping over both of them.<br />
<br />
Amy’s eyes where on Greg and Greg’s on Amy’s both trying to get a hint about what was happening to themselves by watching the other.<br />
What happened first was all their cloths seamed to melt away leaving both of them in the nude as they lied side by side on the sandy bottom of this tiny pool. Amy covered her breasts with one of her hands but as she did, they grew about a cup size becoming closer to C size then the A borderline B cups she had before.<br />
<br />
Greg didn’t attempt to hide his junk because it was hidden for him as flesh wrapped wrapped both his legs together just a second or two before Amy’s legs where also hidden. For a moment Greg did worry that he had lost his manhood but then coming out of a slit came a much larger and more animal like dick. He did attempt to hid that but a blush still crossed Amy’s pale skin as she saw the size of his member. <br />
<br />
Was Amy’s skin always that pale?<br />
<br />
The answer was no, as almost all the pigment left Amy’s skin turning it a sickening yet somehow beautiful white while the freckles which Greg always loved about her turned a dark purple almost black color the same color as her eyes. Auburn red hair turned a blackish purple as well as two extremely long pointed ears came out of it. Gills where now clear as day on her neck as her face because more beautiful yet also horrifying at the same time with an unnatural sharpness. Her lips turned purple as she rolled over to lie face down as she started coughing up her teeth as new sharp needle like teeth came in. The teeth was like one would see on a deep sea fish. Her fingers dug into the sand becoming unnaturally thin and pointer. It reminded Greg of one of those beauty horror makeups he saw on a movie makeup show he had seen on TV. <br />
<br />
For his part, the color wasn’t leaving Greg instead his skin was turning a sort of sickly green, his chest filled out into something any guy would kill to have as his elbows sharped to the point, he could nearly use them as weapons. Then they sharpened to the point they could be weapons. While actual claws grew out of each of his fingers even as his hands became webbed aside from the thumb. Across his back, rib cage and up his neck and along the side of his face thick sharp tiger like black strips appeared. Greg began to cough as well as his teeth went flying upwards before drifting back down towards him before melting away. In their place he felt multiple sharp teeth grow in but not the needle like teeth Amy hand. <br />
<br />
He forced himself up onto his back as he looked down at his legs, his legs had turned to a single limb covered with dark green scales with multiple black bone like horns coming up from different points while his legs formed a tail. <br />
<br />
He looked over toward Amy who was still on her hands coughing into the sand, as suddenly her back bent as a fin of needle like points came out of her spin about of the back of her neck getting longer as it went to the about her upper rib cage area before getting smaller and disappearing around where her tail bone should be. The purple tipped spikes were joined together with a thin purple membrane as her legs now a tail became a single dark purple almost black tail. Around her hips more spikes came out not as long forming a sort of almost belt of needle like points contented by thin black membrane around her hips. <br />
<br />
For a second everything seamed to be over as both of you breathed heavily beside each other, underwater in whatever place this was.<br />
<br />
Then somehow, a leather bikini top formed over Amy’s breasts with of all things the bar’s logo on it while an open vest with the same logo appeared on Greg’s. Both looked at each other, there was a horrifying beauty to Amy, while Greg was handsome in a horrifying way. <br />
Without a word both kicked, toward the surface only to come up into a much different Vegas but still at the pool side bar, only now the pool was on both sides. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck happened?” inquired Amy breathing just as normally now as she did in the water.<br />
<br />
“I don’t fucking know.” Added Greg, “We seamed to be in some kind of hell, and we are mermaids?”<br />
<br />
“Mermaids in hell, don’t be stupid.” stated Amy before a women, maybe one of the members of the bridal party they had been serving went running by, only now she had the lower body and head of a goat. Her breasts where also larger and she was screaming her head off, but the funny thing was she was screaming like a goat. A couple of yards away, multiple demon like people where running out of the water, while someone who looked like the swamp thing in a business suit was running in. “Well, there are water demons, right?”<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck knows.” added Greg “Can someone tell me what the fuck is going on!”</p>
