<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oohhhh...fuuuck...&quot; Henry moaned as he took it all in again. It wasn&#39;t every day after all that you blew up in muscle, and your best friend did so as well. Henry registered the fact that his manhood was as hard as a rock, pressing up against the front of his badly strained boxers. He was also aware of the fact that both he and Eric were now in this similar state, and the incredibly homoerotic tone to this. Two incredibly well muscled young men, standing there and so incredibly aroused, dressed only in boxers which themselves were near to breaking... <i>FUCK</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry?&quot; Eric asked in a quiet tone. He seemed pensive, even as Henry himself was starting to realize the exact implications of all this...and the fact his arousal was still peaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuh...I mean, yes, Eric?&quot; Henry started, quivering, well aware that he was sweating, quite heavily so. His nipples stood out on his chest and his well muscled abs glistened in the light of the room. Henry had never quite felt this way before. He and Eric were young men, so it was true they had a libido - and indeed, he and Eric had discussed their romantic prospects with the female students at college before. But never before in his career as a college student had Henry felt this HORNY before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems,&quot; Eric started as he tried to stretch and lightly flex, taking things slowly, &quot;That whatever did this to us, if I had to guess possibly the---the latte, it has also endowed us with a fearsome libido that the athletes here would be keen to envy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded along, not even paying attention to his friend&#39;s flowery language. He was too focused on his body! Henry watched with wide eyes as he experimented, flexing his biceps, tensing his chest, posing with his back toward some windows so as to watch the flare of his lats...ohh yes, he had never been this hale and healthy before. Henry even found himself flexing his glutes, watching the muscles bulge under his boxers...and OH FUCK he jiggled a little bit! <br />
<br />
Henry grinned - he had a bubble butt!<br />
<br />
But the more that this went on, the more Henry found himself registering that insurgent and insistent libido. Even as he tried to divert the blood into more vain pursuits, it seemed that he inevitably found his attention driving toward sex. He thought about Kristy Evans, the hottie from his geometry class - and whether she&#39;d let him pin her up against the wall, kiss her really passionately, and then plant that rock hard part of himself deep within her. Let her feel his solid eight or nine inches in that wet pussy, and then he&#39;d start thrusting...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry. Henry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!?&quot; Henry felt angry that his fantasy was interrupted, even when it was Eric doing the interruption. For the first time, Henry just as well also found himself reckoning with the side effect of such a groundswell of testosterone. He almost snapped there. He almost took up a more aggressive stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Eric seemed to recognize that, and he said, &quot;You...you kinda uh, spaced out there. And your manhood. You seemed to be uh, you were like, leaking or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh <i>shit</i>!&quot; Henry looked at the small stain on the front of his boxers, and the small trickle of clear liquid down on to the ground. He was initially confused about whatever that might be. He worried he might&#39;ve even cum too soon, but he was still registering urgent and needed arousal. So he realized as he looked that this...this was just his pre-cum! Dripping down on to the floor, right there between him and his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that, Henry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my fucking pre-cum, Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, man. Get your head outta the gutter!&quot; Eric chastised him, even though it seemed Eric could hardly be called a saint in this matter. Just watching how turned on Henry was seemed to have the additional effect of turning Eric on in the process. The rough and stubble laden man&#39;s crotch was every bit as tight, but his seemed to be twitching rather than emitting quite so much pre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you&#39;re one to talk!&quot; Henry teased him.<br />
<br />
Eric moved over and slugged Henry&#39;s shoulder lightly, &quot;Oh fuck off, man, there&#39;s only so much I can see without getting a sympathetic reaction. It&#39;s uh...I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s something scientific that points toward this kind of thing. Like, it&#39;s how porn works on people I think. Can&#39;t remember it exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah...&quot; Henry realized as he stood there that he was according to that more or less living pornography for his best friend. And for whatever reason, that yet again excited him.<br />
<br />
Both young men were starting to realize as they stood there, blushes starting to flourish upon their faces, that they needed to get out there pretty soon and find someone able to handle and help in relieving their arousal. There was only so much the two could do by themselves...right? The two started thinking, Henry about that woman he knew from class - whereas Eric thought about how their mutual friend Lance, who they often helped study for tests so the footballer could keep his grades up, knew so many, many sorority girls. And how Eric really wanted to get to know some of those sorority girls. How they&#39;d surely give him so much more than just the time of day now that he was so big and muscled...!<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems our libidos are raging,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;But it is pretty late. And we might be out of luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Eric responded, &quot;We gotta find someone to help us out. I mean, I am not going to bed <i>blue-balled</i> when I look like an American Gladiator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Henry nodded along. There was nothing he thought of that might be more frustrating than failing to get laid when they had both achieved the bodies of Greek Demi-Gods. They had become some of the most ripped, muscled sons of bitches at the school, and to fail even then...? Well, it was inconceivable! &quot;We gotta find some way to get laid tonight. I&#39;m not going to bed a virgin.&quot;<br />
<br />
He contemplated further, realizing something, &quot;...What if?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if what, Henry?&quot; Eric turned to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we got in some practice?&quot; Henry looked at him with an awkward smile, &quot;Everybody experiments at college. Even the popular guys. Especially them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way...no way...&quot; Eric shook his head several times, resting his temple in his palm and pacing back and forth, &quot;I&#39;m...I mean, I&#39;m not gay, you&#39;re not gay...it&#39;s just not a thing where you can just---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, sexual experimentation is real.&quot; Henry answered, crossing his arms over his broad chest, &quot;And besides, you said it yourself. You don&#39;t wanna go to bed blue-balled. And I don&#39;t wanna go to bed a virgin. We don&#39;t have to. It doesn&#39;t have to become like, a recurring thing. Keep in mind, man on man relationships while at the same time engaging sexually with women has been a thing historically since the Ancient Greeks and Romans. It was considered normal and healthy for a man for example to learn sexually from his larger cohort before engaging with a woman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t that also kinda gross for other reasons?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
Henry shook his head, &quot;Not the point I&#39;m trying to make. What I&#39;m saying is, we don&#39;t gotta attach a label to it. If you like it, fine. If you don&#39;t, also fine. We could try this thing once, and then never do it again if we find it doesn&#39;t suit us. Just keep in mind that two uhh, straight guys fooling around in the context of a pre-female encounter is not as rare as you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric groaned, running his hand through his thick hair, &quot;Fine...fine. Fine. Alright. I&#39;m bored and horny enough that I think even going for you&#39;d likely help with it. How do we start?&quot; Eric hoped he wouldn&#39;t regret this, and being that he had never seen or heard any mention of ways to do something like this...well. He had no idea what he was getting himself into. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well uhh...&quot; Henry admitted that for all his historical context he had no idea how to get a man on man encounter going. &quot;How about we like, kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sure.&quot; Eric closed in quickly, both young men blushing as they recognized how close they were right then and there. Neither exactly sure they wanted to start the kiss...but eventually Henry worked up his nerve and pressed his lips against Eric&#39;s. At first the kiss was tepid, both young men simply smacking their lips together, barely doing anything beyond that. Henry eventually managed to start working in some tongue...and despite his and Eric&#39;s issues, he was rather impressed with how it felt. There was a difference to making out with Eric as opposed to a woman. It wasn&#39;t better, or overwhelming, or possessed of some allure he never knew - it was just...different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, ah...&quot; Eric moaned into the kiss as the two slowly started working on heating up their encounter.<br />
<br />
Henry was aware as he leaned into the kiss that Eric was grinding their hips together, gripping his ass with one hand. Henry decided then and there to repay this in kind. Suddenly he moved his hands around and clutched both of Eric&#39;s voluminous cheeks, grinning between kisses, &quot;...Good for the goose...is good for the gander...&quot; And he was rewarded by Eric moaning lewdly into his mouth and then intensifying their liplock.<br />
<br />
Kissing another man was so different so far from kissing a woman. And it was a sense of difference that gave both Eric and Henry perspective on why it was considered so popular to &quot;experiment in college&quot;.<br />
<br />
The two started wavering, moving around the room - Henry still kneading Eric&#39;s ass, which he seemed to respond well enough to, whereas Eric seemed to have a thing for touching Henry&#39;s muscles. Every moment Henry could feel Eric&#39;s hands moving across his physique, gliding from his well toned muscles one by one, taking in and feeling how tight, toned and large each one was. The sheer scope of their build, the overwhelming size they both now possessed...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...fuck, Henry...&quot; Eric gasped as the two collapsed on to their bed. Not sure what they were going to do from here, but sure at least that this felt good. Henry was at work rubbing at the front of Eric&#39;s boxers in between Eric grinding their hips together. When Henry felt Eric&#39;s hands groping at and touching his pecs, he was astonished by how sensuous and stirring the feeling coming from his nipples was. Henry suppressed a sexed up moan as it seemed Eric had realized he&#39;d found a sensitive spot on Henry.<br />
<br />
All the while the two were intensely making out - each moment seeming to make it become even further heated, even further passionate. Both were only thinking about the eventual release, contemplating how to get there. Neither was sure, but as they writhed on the bed - both alternating between the positions as it went along - Henry realized he was going to need to finish this somehow. While he could not deny that simply humping each other like this was...surprisingly stirring, it also lacked the feeling of completion and &quot;virginity loss&quot; that some more intense sexual experience might bequeath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric...&quot; Henry managed between kisses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, big guy?&quot; Eric paused, realizing Henry wanted to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I wanna do something more...&quot; Henry contemplated, &quot;Let&#39;s...Let&#39;s try something. You and I. I mean, we&#39;re already this far along. We&#39;re experimenting. So I wanna try...&quot;</p>
