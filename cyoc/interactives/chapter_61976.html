You must’ve been starvin’,” comments Rico. <br />
<br />
Isaiah responds by nodding his head as his mouth was too stuffed to speak. Soon afterwards, he swallows the remaining contents, wipes his mouth with his back hand, and proceeds to chug the rest of a cold can of root beer. He sighs in relief and belches boorishly soon afterwards. “Woah, excuse me” he apologizes. “’ey, I really appreciate the chips and the money for the root beer, man. I don’t want to sound greedy, but ya got anythin’ else on ya?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, I’m clean dude” answers Rico as he tosses on a clean Red sleeveless t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Isaiah lustfully eyes the 29-year old as he lifts his leg and slides on a baggy pair of black cargo capris. “You look really cute in that outfit,” eagerly compliments the teen.<br />
<br />
“Thanks. They’re a birthday present from Monty last year.”<br />
<br />
“So he gives you clothes, but steals mine, huh?”  Isaiah couldn’t picture that guy being nice at all.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… Again, I’m real sorry he did that.”<br />
<br />
“Does he like you or something?”<br />
<br />
“Heh. Like is an understatement; the guy’s practically in love with me. When he’s not hangin’ with his bike buddies, he’s either at work or chillin’ with me.”<br />
<br />
“You feel the same way?”<br />
<br />
Rico pulls out a pair of ankle socks and sits on the bench next to Isaiah. “Not really. I mean, Monty’s a cool guy n’ all, but the guy literally has a fetish when it comes to making trouble. He sort of reminds me of a country version of one of those thugs in the city.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, I see…”A brief pause entwines into their conversation and Isaiah begins scratching at his arm again. He examines his skin and finds it to be much dryer then before.	<br />
<br />
Rico catches Isaiah itching at the corner of his eye. “You need some lotion, brah?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was just about to ask.”<br />
<br />
Rico rummages through his duffle bag and tosses a large bottle of lotion to Isaiah. While Isaiah rubs the contents over his arms, Rico slides his feet into his oversized red Nike Air Jordans. He finishes up by using some gel deodorant on his pits, and then grabs a pair of sunglasses and adjusts it on his head. Just before he asks for his lotion back, Rico turns around and is slightly surprised to find Isaiah rubbing some on the top of his back. “You use lotion on your back?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Well… no. It’s just that my back started itchin’ too all of a sudden. You don’t mind me using you lotion like this do you?”<br />
<br />
“Naw. Go ahead and help yourself.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah finishes with his back, and then squirts a little more onto his left palm.  He then starts rubbing it onto his chest and face as he stands and returns the bottle.<br />
<br />
As Rico stuffs it back into his bag, he couldn’t help but sense something a little different about Isaiah. He couldn’t quite put it, but for some reason, Isaiah looks a tad bigger in both height and width.<br />
<br />
“Somethin’ wrong?” asks Isaiah.<br />
<br />
Rico snaps out of it and thinks something’s up with his eyes. “Naw, it’s nothing.” He then shoulders his duffle bag and slams his locker close. “I need to hit the road, man. Thanks for the chat in the shower.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it was a real treat. Sorry if I didn’t talk much. It’s my first time being in a shower with another guy, y’know.”<br />
<br />
Rico pats Isaiah’s shoulder. “Hey, don’t sweat it, man. You get used to it after a while. I’ll be seeing you around this complex more, right?”<br />
<br />
“Eh… Probably not.”<br />
<br />
“Aww, bummer... Well even so, I hope we’ll catch each other again someday! Adios!” Rico gives him a gesture and begins walking out of the locker room.<br />
<br />
“H-hey, wait!,” shouts Isaiah as he turns around. “Um… D-do you think…I can get your number? Maybe, we can chill… again sometime.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm? I thought you had the hots for Lester?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah was about to deny it; however, upon thinking of Lester he couldn’t bring himself to say no and blushes. “Uh… um…eheheh...”<br />
<br />
“Well… Y’know, don’t take this the wrong way man. You’re a pretty nice guy, but my preferences lies in dudes around my age or much older.”<br />
<br />
As soon as Isaiah heard that, a truck blasts its way through his confidence and shatters it into pieces. “Oh… uh, yeah that’s understandable I guess…”<br />
<br />
“Aww, don’t be upset man. I really did like hangin’ with ya today. We can still be friend’s right?”<br />
<br />
“Su-sure..!” <br />
<br />
“Awesome! I really gotta go, bro. See ya!”  With that, Rico leaves the shower room and makes his way to exit.<br />
<br />
Isaiah was extremely disappointed by Rico’s turn down. Just when he was beginning to adapt to being a homosexual, this happens. “Damn, man...” he mumbles. He turns back around and depressingly mopes back to the bench where his AXE bottle rests. As he sits, Isaiah sees a scrawny middle age male approaching him. He recognizes the man as the same one who gave him “advice” back within the restroom. The man is completely shirtless and although scrawny, the middle age man was extremely hairy; much more so then any other bear Isaiah has seen yet. “Awe, poor fella. Turned ya down, did he?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“You were listenin’?”<br />
<br />
“Heheh, shure was. Ain’t no one else in here y’know.”<br />
<br />
“Oh…,” replies Isaiah lowly. “Whaddya want ol’ man?”<br />
<br />
“Well, after gettin’ rejected like that, Ah jus’ figger ya wanted sum company is all. Ya mind if’n ah sit wit ya?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah figures why not. It’s not like he can just leave this place anyway. He scoots over a bit to make room for the man.<br />
<br />
“Thanks fella,” says the guy as he sits just next to Isaiah.<br />
<br />
Isaiah can feel the man’s shoulder & bicep fur rubbing against his skin. He also picks up a sweaty odor emanating from the man as well. “Great... ANOTHER guy that’s a turn on…,” grieves the teen in his head as he senses his lust swelling.<br />
<br />
“So what’s yer name, boy?”<br />
<br />
“Isaiah.”<br />
<br />
The old man reaches his hand out for a shake. “The name’s Roger. Ah seen ya in the workout room earlier.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah doesn’t respond and returns the handshake. <br />
<br />
“What’s a youngen like you doin’ in this joint?”<br />
<br />
“I came here lookin’ for one of my friends. His name’s [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. You heard of him?”<br />
<br />
The man plays with his pepper colored beard. “Naw… Can’t say that ah have.”<br />
<br />
“Figures…” replies Isaiah in his head.<br />
<br />
“So ya came here fer a friend, eh? Why you sittin’ in a bathhouse wit’ only a towel round yer waist then?”<br />
<br />
“Good question,” Isaiah thought. At first he couldn’t understand what drove him to come here; but now, he realizes it must’ve been for Rico. He ended up ditching his friends in order to fulfill his own newfound pleasures. Thinking about it that way only makes Isaiah more irritated and a little ashamed. “I… came here to see if I can hook up with that guy …” utters Isaiah in a pitiful tone as he could no longer lie to himself.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be so under the bucket ‘bout it, boy. There’s plenty of fish in the sea.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not that. It’s just…” Isaiah started to feel a little dizzy. “Well… it’s… just…” Immediately afterwards, his vision begins to blur and a sharp pain is felt throughout his entire head. “AHHH!” he screams in agony as he stands and covers his face.<br />
<br />
Roger instantly rises and stops Isaiah from collapsing. “Woah woah! What’s happenin’!? Calm down!” <br />
<br />
“My… head…!” he replies as the pain already begins to subside.<br />
<br />
“Hold on! I’ma git sum help!”<br />
<br />
“Wai-Wait!” Isaiah shakes his head and slowly opens his eyes. “I-I’m fine…!”<br />
<br />
“Ya shure, boy?<br />
<br />
He clutches his head again and straightens himself up. “Y-yeah…! I think.”<br />
<br />
“Ahright. Good! Ya really got me worried fer a sec… there.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah notices the pause in Roger’s sentence. “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Yer-yer face… It’s…”<br />
<br />
In a complete panic, Isaiah speeds into the restroom, and immediately upon reaching a mirror, he glimpses upon someone else looking back at him. “No… fucking… way…” he stutters in complete shock as this entity in the mirror does the same. “Th-This… isn’t possible…” He doesn’t want to believe it, but his entire facial structure had shifted into that of another person. What’s even more frightening is that the skin around his (or whoever’s) nose has “cracked away” sort of speak. Indeed, his nose has become that of a white male. Wondering if this is real or not, he slowly moves his hand towards the cracked black skin and begins “peeling” it away. His mind soon delves into a pit of darkness and the teen stood their completely dumbfounded. The burning pain returns, but this time throughout his entire body. Isaiah’s couldn’t take all of this hitting him at once; thus, his eyes rolls back and he falls unconscious onto Roger’s hirsute arms who was just behind him.<br />
<br />
Roger became so frantically confused and awed by this bizarre situation that he just drops Isaiah onto the hard floor. Doing this not only further cracked the skin on Isaiah’s head, but also made the skin along the teen’s waistline, arms, chest, and back crack a little as well. “H-help….!” yells the middle age man as he darts out the restroom. As he leaves the locker room, he turns and collides into Lester.<br />
Lester sighs and brushes his arm. “Ouch! Ya clumsy fool; watch where yer goin’!”<br />
<br />
“L-L-L-Lester boy, sum-sumthin’… sumthin’-” <br />
<br />
“Stop yer stutterin’ ol’ man! Lemme guess; sumthin’ happened to that black fella back there, huh?”<br />
<br />
Roger nods his head.<br />
<br />
“Figgers… Take me to him.”<br />
<br />
Roger then leads Lester back into the restroom and shows him the scene. He then proceeded to tell him the events that transpired previously. <br />
<br />
“Hmm, ahmagine this would happen…” comments Lester.<br />
<br />
“What’s goin’ on wit’ him, Lest? Why’s his skin all comin’ apart?”<br />
<br />
“He’s turnin’ into a full-blown country bear like the rest of us.” Lester digs his fingernails into Isaiah’s skin on his back hand and peels off a small piece of it. “Looks like he’s rearin’ to be a real hairy one at that,” he comments as long brown body hair pops out from the removed layer.<br />
<br />
“What!?! How!?”<br />
<br />
Lester figures it would be best not to tell this guy too much information. “Ah ain’t too shure how mahself, but he is. Ah reckon it’s all science ‘n stuff.”<br />
<br />
“So, sum science is makin’ his skin turn white?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, ah don’t know, ol’ man. Ah guess so.” Lester walks around Isaiah’s body. “Help me carry him under the showers. Ah’m gonna havta start strippin’ the rest of his skin.”<br />
<br />
Lester grabs and carries the top of Isaiah while Roger get’s his legs. He notices how big Isaiah’s feet are compared to what they were a couple of minutes ago. The large black shower sandals seem to fit him rather well now. As they carry him, Isaiah’s towel falls off and they both notice the teen’s semi-erect cut penis. <br />
<br />
“Heh, he must be havin’ a good dream,” comments Roger.<br />
<br />
Lester doesn’t reply as he was too concentrated on tending to his friend. They soon set him down on a shower bench and Lester immediately picks up a dry bucket nearby. “Start pickin’ off his skin and put it in this bucket. I’m ‘fin ta lock this place up and get a bag.” <br />
<br />
“Uh… shure thing.” replies Roger. <br />
<br />
As Lester leaves the showers, Roger stands and gets a good look at the changing teen and his “gift”. Although freaked out, he’s mildly enticed at how this relatively smooth black kid is turning into a hairy white male. He looks in wonder as the boy slowly gains body mass and as some of the skin naturally fall away on its own. To him, it was like watching a baby hatchling breaking from its egg. Judging by the kid’s fruitful boner, it seems the young lad is rather enjoying it as well; at least, in his dreams. Roger cups his own penis as the mere sight of this boy changing into a man is gives him a hard on. He achingly bends down on his knees, takes a hold of the teens’ penis with his right hand, and slowly caresses the lad’s new facial structure with the other. “Yer a rather endowed fella, aint’ cha?” he asks as he fondles with the boy’s long rod. “Ah betchyer a real handsome gun under all this black skin.” Roger peels away some of the skin from Isaiah’s cheeks before diving in and licking off the remains. He spits the old skin into the bucket and wipes his mouth. “Hmhm, you got a good taste to ya…” The old man then dives his mouth onto Isaiah’s large white nose and begins sucking on it like a lollipop. His slimy tongue twists and attempts to drill into the teen’s stout nostrils, getting a small taste of the dried nasal mucus in the process. Soon afterwards, he gives one final lick and rises away from the teen’s nose which is now drenched in the older man’s thick saliva. <br />
<br />
Still engulfed by lust, Roger quickly wipes his mouth and stretches himself over to the teen’s plump rod. He immediately engulfs Isaiah’s skin-cracked shlong and starts working it as if it’s his daily job. Roger had to slow down as he could feel Isaiah’s penis reaching its full erection in his mouth. Judging by the boy’s semi-erect size, he knew there’s no way he’ll be able to deep-throat the entire thing while it’s fully stiff. Slithers of skin from the shaft and head are sucked away and Roger could sense a change along the head. He grunts in pleasure, removes his mouth from the rod, and sees the boy’s penis has become naturally uncircumcised. Of course, the skin color and pigment is akin to that of a white male’s penis now. In addition, the shaft was covered in protrusions of thick veins.<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to continue, a loud “HEY!!” is heard behind him. He turns around and sees Lester quickly approaching. Lester grabs Roger’s bicep and pulls the lust-filled man away from his friend. “What ‘n grant’s name ya doin’ to him!?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Ah’s jus’ pickin’ the skin off… like ya told me to,” Roger replies as he wipes some layers of black skin from his mouth and swallows the rest.<br />
<br />
Disgusted, Lester forcefully pushes him away towards the exit. “Urgh… yer nasty man. That poor fella’s unconscious and probably scared shitless; yet here ya are, suckin’ on his rod like a mindless idiot! You fuckin’ rapist! If mah buddy wasn’t in that state, ah’d call the blue-suits (cops) on yer hind!”<br />
<br />
“Woah, now. Mah fault. Ah couldn’t control mahself.”<br />
<br />
“Tch! Yeah right!! Jus’ evermore reason why ya rear should be behind bars! You give us bears a bad name. Jus’ fetch yer shirt and scram! Mah pah will beat ya to the ground once he hears ‘bout this!”<br />
<br />
“Hmph! Whatever, boy. Ah reckon the kid enjoyed it.”<br />
<br />
Lester really lost it when he heard that; however, he holds himself back as he knew it’s best not to waste time on this old fool.“Jus’ git! NOW!!” he yells.<br />
<br />
“Keep yer britches on, Ah’m leavin’…” With that Roger leaves the shower room and heads out the door.<br />
<br />
Lester quickly turns around and rushes back to his friend’s aid. “Don’t worry, buddy. Good ol’ Lester will take care o’ ya.” He then scoots the bucket over, puts the trash bag in it, and slowly begins peeling off the rest of Isaiah’s former black skin. <br />
<br />
Lester finishes up his face, and is mildly surprised at how different his friend looks now. His cheeks are much plumper and have a healthy pink/rich maroon-ish glow to them, his jaw is squarer while maintaining a thick roundness to it, and his chin has a cute yet small dimple in the middle. Furthermore, Isaiah’s brows protrude further; and, his nose (of course) is a lot more pronounce and much larger in general. His new facial feature’s compliments the bulkier and rounder size of his skull perfectly. Lester notices the eyebrows and eyelashes are quickly starting to grow in; thus, he grabs his friend’s former hairline and pulls off the entire scalp in one go. The pain of this was so immense, that it caused Isaiah to regain consciousness and hiss lowly.<br />
<br />
“Uh… whoops… sorry, man”, apologizes Lester as he drops the crumbled dark scalp in the bucket. He then sits Isaiah up and begins lightly smacking his friend on the cheek. “Isaiah! Come on, big guy! Stay wit’ me.”<br />
<br />
“L-…Lester…?” he mumbles as he slowly comes to.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, ah’m here.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah places his bulkier palm on his forehead and opens his eyes. “Du-dude… you’re back. Urggg… This headache…” he moans achingly.<br />
<br />
Lester instantly picks up the change in his friends voice. Although not as deep as one would expect of his (new) size, it’s still completely different as his vocal chords are akin to that of an average Caucasian. <br />
<br />
“What-what’s with my voice? It feels like something’s in my throat; and my body… it’s so itchy”<br />
<br />
“Uh… it’s yer adam’s apple.”<br />
<br />
“What..? I-I don’t have an adam’s apple.” Isaiah rubs his neck and feels a rather large lump there. Suddenly, he remembers having that painful headache earlier, and then recalls those dreadful images he saw in the mirror. <br />
<br />
Lester catches his friend’s eyes widening and reacts. “H-hey! Please don’t blow a gasket, ahright? Ah’m fixin’ to tell ya everything, so jus’ please bear with me.<br />
<br />
Isaiah didn’t need to hear an explanation. Despite the absurdness of it all, he knows he’s becoming that gay brute in that dream of his. “Just save it, man… I know I’m turnin’ into a bear like you, alright?” Lester is left speechless while Isaiah grows silent and looks down at his much larger feet. He examines the mix of black and white skin and notices how the previously big shower sandals securely fit him now. “Why… didn’t you just confess to me straight up, Lester?”<br />
<br />
“How could I? “Hey, man! Not only you a homo now, but yer also gonna turn into a big hairy bear as well! Oh yeah, yer also gonna be a white guy and no one will recognize ya.” he mocks. “Most would turn all crazy if they were told that out the blue.  Ah figger you would too.”<br />
<br />
Lester makes a valid point; but nevertheless, any person has the right to know what’s happening to their own body regardless if it’s too hard for the person to handle or not. Unfortunately, all that’s past & done and he’s more than half-way to being a bear now. “So tell me, is anything else gonna happen to me?”<br />
<br />
Lester decides to go ahead and tell him the entire truth. “Well… truth be told, the reason why yer a white guy is ‘cause mah pa put sum o’ mah D.N.A in ya. It’s reactin’ to the special tobacco in yer system and it’s changin’ yer D.N.A to copy mine somewhat. Once I finish peelin’ the rest of yer old skin and all yer hair grows in, you gon’ end up lookin’ like mah kin.<br />
<br />
“That’s not everything though, right…?” comments a skeptical Isaiah.<br />
<br />
“Err… no. Ya see, mah pa and some execs from a company called Arctos wanna make ya one of tha head honchos ‘round here.<br />
<br />
“What… does that mean?”<br />
<br />
“It means exactly as it does. They aim to craft ya into an authoritative figger hopin’ you can shove sum discipline and sense into these bears. Once mah pah and Monty put their D.N.A in ya, not only will ya turn older fer tha job, but yer also gonna end up rightfully becomin’ Monty’s daddy as well. Yer gonna be mah uncle and be part of our family.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah once again grew silent. “I kinda figured that was the case…”<br />
<br />
Lester asks what he meant by that and Isaiah tells him about the dream he had while in the bar. “Oh… I see now,” replies Lester. “It ain’t uncommon for someone to dream ‘bout their new selves. Ah was in the same boat as well, man.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…! You tellin’ me you went through all this to?”<br />
<br />
"Yep, Ah was mah pa’s first victim as you could say. After mama died a long time ago, mah pa couldn’t keep up wit’ our shop in the city. He needed help money-wise so he ended up meetin’ a man named Allen Pryce from a shady industry called Arctos. Ever since, mah pa ‘came more and more interested in the bear community; to tha point, where he picked up the pounds and became a gay bear himself. Soon afterwards, he introduced mahself to Arctos’s special chaw and forced me to try some.  You can probably reckon what happened after that.<br />
<br />
Isaiah nods his head. <br />
<br />
“Mmhmm. So anyway, ah changed from a skinny guy into a chubby hairy cub. At first, ah was like you earlier and didn’t want to believe it; so, I ended up testin’ the waters to see if ah still had some hetero-mentality in me. Ah soon met Suzy at school and we started dated for a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Suzy? You mean that chick at the front desk when we came in?”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh, her. Unfortunately, mah “straightness” gradually went away and ah was stuck in a relationship that ah can’t enjoy anymore. Ah ended up breakin’ up with her; and the next day after, ah started joinin’ mah pa everytime he went to the bears den.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds real tough man… I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Naw, it wasn’t all bad. Ah ‘ventually got used to mah new lifestyle as a cub and started to enjoy mahself. Mah pa ended up becomin’ Arctos’ posterboy and we moved back out to the country to start our own joint. As soon’s we did though, Arctos calls up sayin’ they gotta a “customer” who hates their ol’ life and wanted a new one. So to keep on their good side, mah pa took him in and used the chaw to change him into the Monty you know now.<br />
<br />
“So, he’s not even your real cousin?”<br />
<br />
“Nope; but since he got sum of mah family’s D.N.A in him now, he’s kin to us. Mah pa and I never really see him as such though ‘cause the way he act.”<br />
<br />
“If… or, when… I officially become part of your family. Will you guys’ treat me the same way?”<br />
<br />
“To be frank wit ya, I’m not sure. Ah really jus’ see you as a friend man. Ah can’t picture ya ‘comin’ an uncle o’ mine.<br />
<br />
Isaiah in a weird way feels disappointed to hear that. If he’s going to end up becoming an uncle, a father, and a brother for the rest of his life, he at least wants them to rightfully acknowledge him as so. “Hey, man… uh… can you like... start treatin me like your uncle?”<br />
<br />
“What…? Is sumthin’ loose in yer head or are ya seriously dandy wit’ all o’ this?”<br />
<br />
“To be honest, I’m scared out of my wits. My old life is practically gone, man. No one, not even my friend’s will recognize me like this. To that end, no one will ever believe my story of a can of gay-changing chaw and bears as well. It’s really hard trying to soak this all in; but in the end, I don’t want to end up grieving in despair for the rest of my life, y’know?"<br />
<br />
Hearing that from a guy who was drove to tears because he turned homo is… shocking to say the least. “Um… wow,” stutters Lester. “Ah shure didn’t magine you would take it this well… What happened to you when ah was gone?”<br />
<br />
“Rico happened, that’s what. We ended up taking a shower together and I stood to your advice to the very end. Despite HOW I became gay, I think I can live with being a queer. I see it’s not all bad; and besides, I’m still the same guy inside. You told me no matter how different I become, as long as I stay strong and be a man, I’ll always be the the same guy, right?<br />
<br />
“Sumthin’ like that yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if/when I become yer uncle I’m sure I’ll still be the same ol’ Isaiah, and since I might be living the rest of my life akin to you and as a bear, I just want you guys to at least feel that I’m truly part of your family as I am.”<br />
<br />
“Well shucks man, ah don’t know what to say…,” mumbles Lester as he grabs a hold of his friends hand. “Ah can’t say fer mah pa or Monty, but ah shure would like to feel yer part of mah family. It’ll take some time; but if’n ya want, ah’ll start callin’ ya mah uncle, alright?"<br />
<br />
“Thanks er… nephew,” replies a blushing Isaiah. “Umm… wanna give your uncle a hug?”<br />
<br />
Lester dives into his uncle’s chest and gives him a big hug. Isaiah smiles goofily for a bit, and returns his nephew’s hug with equal passion. “So I guess my name’s Isaiah Maxwell now, eh?”<br />
<br />
“Shure is, unck.”Lester rubs his head on his uncle’s chest which accidentally causes the dense brown body hair from underneath to break forth from the cracked skin.<br />
<br />
Isaiah moans in bliss as his newly grown chest hair is constrained no longer and receives its first trifle of fresh air. “Aww, man. That felt really good.”<br />
<br />
Lester removes himself from Isaiah’s grasp. “Eheh, yeah… Let’s get all this black skin off ya now eh?”<br />
<br />
“Please. My back’s killing me.” Isaiah turns away from Lester and the two begin to peel the rest of the skin away.</p>
