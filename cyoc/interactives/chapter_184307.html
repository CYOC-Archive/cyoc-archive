<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh yeah, sorry Dan. We&#39;re just surprised that you saved up that much money to buy snacks for us since you usually just get, like, one container of popcorn for yourself.&quot;<br />
All of Dan&#39;s snacks began to spread out amongst the 4 of us. I got the M&M bag and medium soda, Jeff got 2 chocolate granola bars and a water, Kent got a bag of Hershey Kisses and large soda, and- as directly stated -Dan got a large container of popcorn. Along with the container, Dan got a lot less fat than before. He wasn&#39;t even close to his athlete form, but this was an improvement none the less.<br />
And just like that, I managed to fix Dan&#39;s eating habits and get myself some free candy. Now I just-<br />
&quot;Hey Dan, you bought that popcorn just for me...&quot;<br />
Jeff acted like he was going to finish his sentence, but it was obvious he was just being a cunning jerk. Dan nodded and gave the popcorn to him.<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, I wanted to get a container for the three of us too, but I forgot to get it. I&#39;ll go back down and get that.&quot;<br />
As Dan speed-walked down, Jeff gave me a sly grin. Knowing him though, this was probably him showing off the &quot;better payload&quot; rather than him planning to fight me about undoing Dan&#39;s inflation.<br />
<br />
Before Dan got back, the movie began playing. It was a new-ish action movie about a car race to the death. Me and Jeff already saw it at the premiere, but Kent really wanted to see it with Dan, and he ended up inviting us along. I looked over at Jeff and immediately knew that he was gonna start something.<br />
&quot;Psst, hey Kent. The main character? He dies halfway through and gets replaced.&quot;<br />
Kent didn&#39;t budge, but I could see that he was upset. I was also upset, but rather because I got spoiled, it was because that didn&#39;t happen. Jeff was changing the truth again, and I had to think of a way to stop him.<br />
&quot;Huh? What are you talking about? There isn&#39;t a &#39;false protagonist&#39; thing here. Remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. He definitely gets ran over. In fact, I heard that instead of using digital effects, they actua-&quot;<br />
&quot;Jeff, no. You shouldn&#39;t be trying to ruin the movie with some dumb rumors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, [Name]. The dude dies. Let me have this.&quot;<br />
&quot;...You must still be reeling from that fall you took on the stairs.&quot;<br />
Suddenly, Jeff&#39;s food left his hands and teleported to the seat on his right. He had a bandage in the middle of his forehead that he started rubbing. Kent, who was getting annoyed at the two of us arguing, said, &quot;Oh yeah, you should probably see a doctor afterwards.&quot;<br />
I didn&#39;t like what I did in the slightest, but not only was he upsetting people and drawing attention to us, he was also ready to kill the lead actor! Other than obvious moral problems, a human death being shown in a released film could cause a horrifying butterfly effect.<br />
Dan started to walk back up when a mother with a kid told him about us. He went to confront us before returning and telling the Mom about the movie&#39;s plot. She nodded her head and tried to get her son to leave. Obviously, this ended up being a bigger disruption that led to the movie starting over and the two being escorted out. Lucky for us, since that meant we didn&#39;t have to &quot;whisper&quot; for the time being.<br />
&quot;What the hell guys? Not talking at movies is- it&#39;s one of the biggest rules!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh fuck off Dan, the movie was barely starting! It doesn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t make me regret wasting $21 on you. Shut up, and watch the movie.&quot;<br />
Even though Dan wasn&#39;t cursed and he was less muscular, his voice was imposing on Jeff that he stayed quiet. Just to make sure though, I whispered, &quot;Jeff won&#39;t speak until he leaves the theater.&quot;<br />
Even though Dan was just 21, he was kind of like the group&#39;s dad. He always scolded us whenever we fucked up, but also was the most enthusiastic when we did good and most comfortable when bad stuff happened. He... He should have been on the Subway with Jeff. He would have let him have it. Now though...<br />
My left shoulder was tapped a bit. I looked over and found Kent looking at me. He gave a thumbs up and tilted his head, his way of asking if I was good. Even though he doesn&#39;t know ASL, Kent was a master at non-verbal communication. He was also the one to tell when someone&#39;s having a bad day and knew how to help out. He was like a mini-psychologist, even though he never took any psychology classes or the major. There was also just, something about him, something that changed my bad state into happiness. I gave him a heartfelt thumbs up, and we continued watching the movie with no more interruptions.<br />
<br />
The movie ended and everyone left began to file out. I was the 2nd-to-last person to leave before Jeff grabbed my collar. Looking back on it, I should have known that he would find out about my statement. We tussled a bit before he pushed me down the stairs and I kicked him into a seat. I grabbed the railing just in time and held him down.<br />
&quot;Jeffery, stop this now! You don&#39;t know what powers you&#39;ve been given!&quot;<br />
Even though he couldn&#39;t speak, he could still open his mouth, which he did to spit at me.<br />
&quot;Jeff. You almost *killed* someone. If I didn&#39;t make you hit your head, you would have gotten a whole-ass snuff film into a theater. You do know what the Butterfly Effect is, right?&quot;<br />
Jeff began biting at me, like actually chomping his mouth at me like dog. I had to back away, which gave him the time to flip me off and run down the stairs.<br />
If I didn&#39;t stop him now, there&#39;s no telling what he&#39;d do. I have to be careful with this though, since preventing him from ever being an ass to the gypsy could cause some time-space anomaly. When I left the screening, he was almost out of the theater. In the last second, I said...</p>
