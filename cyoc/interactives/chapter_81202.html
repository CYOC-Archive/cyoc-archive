<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'm sorry sir, but there's nothing I can do. There was once a youthening clock that paired with the aging <br />
clock, yet it was destroyed a few years back in a fire. I'm afraid you'll just have to wait it out and hope <br />
the changes aren't permanent. Tell me, how many times were you affected by the clock?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see, about 4 times&quot;.<br />
<br />
The man thought for a moment. &quot;And that was over the past 24 hours? You might still have a chance. The longer <br />
the clock runs uninterrupted, the more of a chance the aging becomes permanent, especially if it is set on a <br />
low setting, anything under about a year every 20 minutes. Short bursts of aging are much more temporary, <br />
although again the longer it's used, the less temporary it becomes. The effects tend to disappear within a <br />
day. Although multiple exposures in a short period of time can increase the chances of not becoming your <br />
original age, it is a definite you will at least return to an age where you stopped using the clock&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake let out a sigh of relief. &quot;Well at least I won't be 60 any more. But the first time I used the clock, I <br />
thought it was an alarm. I ended up 20 years older over 10 hours. What are the chances of becoming a kid <br />
again?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man shook his head. &quot;I'd say it's extremely slim, sorry. Looks like you're stuck as an adult. For now, I <br />
can do some research to see if there's any way to help you, but I am only an amateur in the temporal arts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Temporal arts? You mean people practice time magic or something?&quot; Jake had never heard of such a thing. He'd <br />
would of originally assumed it was ridiculous, but aging 50 years in a day had certainly changed his tune.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that. I only got into it after a man mistook me for a different clock maker many years back. He <br />
kept me in time stasis for 4 hours until he realised his mistake. Since then, I've been learning about it in <br />
my spare time. In fact, the aging clock was sent to me just last week by a cloaked man, telling me to sell it <br />
to the first person who asked for it, which just happened to be you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cloaked man? It sounded ominous. What if he did something to the clock to make things permanent? Jake shook <br />
the thought from his head. &quot;Well if there are temporal arts, then there must be other ways to make someone <br />
younger apart from that clock!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The man sighed and said &quot;Well you'd think that, but most of the temporal arts focuses on affecting time <br />
itself. Stopping, reversing, speeding, slowing, whatever. It's a very delicate business. The clock was an <br />
extremely rare artifact. It had the power to youthen an individual without affecting the rest of time around <br />
them. Of course it had its side effects, which you boys have already discovered with its counterpart, which is <br />
why it was one-of-a-kind. Nobody wanted to risk getting too young to remember how to work the clock as they'd <br />
disappear from existence. It's difficult to contain the effects of time and focus it on a single subject <br />
without all kinds of problems. People think they can just drink some water and be rejuvenated, but that's <br />
never how it works. However, there are alternatives. It is possible to transfer age between you and a willing <br />
participant, as the exchange of time is equal. There is also a token that is able to adjust reality to include <br />
time displaced individuals such as yourself, as many people make mistakes in time that could shatter the <br />
fabric of reality. However, I think those should only be an option if I can't find anything to help you by <br />
tomorrow. For now, I suggest you go back home and rest. If you and your friend aren't any younger by tomorrow <br />
then come to this address&quot;, the man wrote down a home address on a piece of paper and handed it over to Jake, <br />
&quot;because I'm not open on Sundays and I have all my resources at home&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake thanked him and went back home, arriving slightly winded and with a dull ache in his knee. To think he <br />
couldn't wait to grow up a few days ago. He found Matt still on the sofa asleep, snoring loudly. Although <br />
irritating, at least it meant he was still alive. Jake went over and nudged him awake. Matt tried to sit up in <br />
shock, but yelled out in pain. He'd definitely broken his back after Jake dropped him. He mumbled to himself <br />
while Jake slowly sat down in the armchair opposite. Jake explained to Matt everything that the man had told <br />
him about their situation. After he'd finished, Matt thought over his words then said &quot;So we'll get younger <br />
but not be kids again?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much but also no. You'll have a much better chance of becoming 10 again, but I was affected by the <br />
clock while I was asleep, so there's a big chance I won't get younger than 30&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you were awesome at 30. That's not too bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, but I just want to be a kid again. I'm fed up with being old&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt nodded his head. He wanted to be a man, but never this old. &quot;So we just wait huh? Can't we wait in bed? I <br />
have never been this tired before in my life. It's only 7 and yet I bet I'll sleep all the way back to youth&quot;. <br />
Jake couldn't agree more. He helped his friend off the sofa and up the stairs into his parents room. They both <br />
flopped onto the large bed and fell asleep instantly.</p>
