<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Handsome, a satyr worthy of his name and formerly a human frat pledge called Mark, was a new father and he loved it. He did not know how much was because he really was genuinely happy at being a father and how much was because his new son was his bully in his past life. The maenad he had impregnated was as sweet and nice as his other lovers and she had done a stellar job at carrying her pregnancy, gushing and laughing as she thought it funny that Handsome took an interest to it much greater than other satyrs, themselves good fathers and enjoying the presence of children, even if they weren&#39;t his. Everyone commended the paternal abilities of Handsome once his baby son was born. Oh, he had fretted immensely during his lover&#39;s labour, s much he had been more frightened than her, when she explained the babe she was about to have would not be her first. When the infant, named Aran, was placed in his daddy&#39;s arms, his face reflected all the relief in the world. He had laughed the hardest too when Aran had instinctively suckled his mother&#39;s milk through her nipple, obviously extremely happy to have a little boy.<br />
And Handsome was lauded by all to be a stellar father. He was so supportive towards little Aran! He checked on him and and fussed all the time like a mother hen, asking his partner endless questions and always proposing he take charge of the infant. The maenad laughed, saying that after the babe was weaned, Aron would become his mother in all but sex and that it was excellent to have such a doting paternal figure for her little boy. The other members of the community chuckled at Handsome&#39;s attitude but not in a hostile way. It was amusing to see but guaranteed a valuable member of society who&#39;d help raise children and was already proving himself a jovial companion and devoted father and helper. Everyone was liberated here and more tolerant than within human society. And was Handsome a caring, devoted and supportive father! Aran was the apple of his eyes, it seemed, the way he never let him out of his sight. He carried him in a sling across his chest everywhere and as soon as Aron was hungry, he let him suckle any breasts he wanted, gushing at his movements and healthy appetite. Even after he was weaned, the caring daddy loved to offer him a bottle, delighting in any babyish attitude he kept. He saw absolutely no problem in diapering, burping and rocking his baby to sleep. In fact, no one noticed the evil little glint in his eyes as he sometimes doted upon his son, mollycoddling him all day long.<br />
<br />
Handsome loved being with his former bully. His desires had really come true. Aran was now barely three and toddling around. Mark had developed genuine love and care for his baby. It seemed his desires to check if his past bully would grow up as he wanted had seriously rubbed off on him. Also, the toddler that was formerly Arthur was really, really cute. All gushed as he tottered around naked, showing off his butt with its tufty tail, and his minuscule goat horns and ears, smiling innocently at all. He did not have the legs of a goat but no one cared, really. They all assumed he had simply taken after his mother. And everything Mark had decided Arthur to become was so far becoming a reality. He had left him with more human features than a faun or a satyr. His face and hair would remain the same. But his frame would be skinny and hairless. He could say goodbye to his prized virility! Also he would be incredibly shy and scared of his own shadow. This worked perfectly well, Aran seeking refuge behind his daddy&#39;s legs, grasping his loincloth in fright and tears in his eyes, sucking his thumb. Or he cried and snivelled abundantly if his father was out of his sight. Everyone marvelled at Handsome&#39;s incredible patience, never imagining that it was tinged with sweet vengeance at seeing his former enemy humiliated so without his knowing, indeed encouraged by the one that was the object of his love and admiration. Because Aran absolutely adored his father, basking in his love and attention, scrabbling for any piece of affection, acceptance and approval he could bestow upon him. His eyes shone with love at his model and Handsome just could not get enough of that. Having Aran near meant he could tease him under the pretext of playing and pampering him. His son was already staring with wild eyes at musicians and smiled at tasting foods, showing he would develop artistic talents later on, a much better use of his brain than before. And he just loved foods, a real explorer of new tastes. And he was so cute! How could a former bully be such an adorable little toddler? His chin, armpits and feet (another reason to keep them human) were tickle magnets and Handsome never refrained from gently torturing his former tormentor with tickling. A painless torture that tickled his little son, to mould as he wished, into submission. His steady diet of milk, bread, olives and honey had shaped the sweetest little paunchy belly that attracted more tickling, brushing fingers, poking and made Aran squirm, gurgle and giggle amongst cooing and kisses. A situation his former self Arthur would have loathed and be appalled to see. Which he would realize in the future, in many, many years. But Handsome would always be a supportive father, in spite of his teasing. After all, he felt genuine love for his son. He would enjoy seeing Arthur realize what his life had become but he hoped that he&#39;d understand that his life was indeed more fruitful as he moulded it for him. And he was just teasing in the meantime. Tickling Aran under the chin, uttering sweet words to him and long strings of &#39;coochie coochie coo&#39;, pampering him and mollycoddling him all day long was something the toddler fully basked in and adored too. His shyness just made him all the more cute. He was a little pot of glue, staying near him all the time, but he most adorable one ever. It was clear he&#39;d do anything Handsome would ask of him. And Handsome encouraged him without fail, reassuring him constantly he&#39;d always love him, to not worry because he&#39;d pamper him and give him plenty of soup so he could grow up fast and that he would encourage him to be the best musician and cook ever. And he tickled his son, happy to see him so happy but still in the back of his mind content to see his past foe so compliant and helpless under his tickling assaults. When they were alone, he could tease Arthur fully by calling him by his name and asking him if he loved being what re hated and if he loved being a scared little effeminate boy so reliant on the dweeb he scorned so much but now thought the world of. If he loved being surrounded by women who just thought him adorable enough to offer him them breasts. But only to suck on their nipples because for the rest he was just too, too young. Those things were for his well-endowed father to have pleasure in once he was asleep in his cradle. He&#39;d leave him with tiny privates, even as an adult, but it was not important for the others, just for Arthur, and Aran would then have more time to invest in more artistic purposes that would be admired by all their little community.</p>
