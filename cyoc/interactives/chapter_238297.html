<br />
Jackie O&#39;Toole-Kirkman sat behind the wheel of her car while she looked over to the passenger side to see her beautiful wife, Ann, holding a pie they were bringing over to the Harris family home. Thanksgiving had come and both the Harris siblings, as well as their own children had yet to return from the kitsune realm. Typically the couple would spend Thanksgiving with Ann&#39;s sister Lisa, however, Lisa and her husband decided to vacation this year. With the rest their families having other plans, Ann and Jackie were beyond thankful for an invite from the Harris family. Still, this was proving to be a difficult holiday.<br />
<br />
Ann had been okay maybe a day or so after their daughters had left, but it had at least been a week at most now, and they hadn&#39;t heard anything from and Ann was beginning to fear the worst. Jackie and Ann finally made their way into the driveway of the Harris home where Ann had been staring down at the pie, and didn&#39;t even look up when the car stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel, we&#39;re here.&quot; Jackie said gently putting her hand on her wife&#39;s shoulder. Ann looked up to see the Harris home before them, and they could see Claudia and Mika standing outside to greet them. Ann and Jackie now got out of the car and went to greet the couple at the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie, Ann, it&#39;s so nice of you two to come for Thanksgiving with us.&quot; Claudia thanked the women as Ann quietly nodded. Mika also remained quiet too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for inviting us Claudia, we really needed to take our minds off of things, what with my job, and Ann at home, she&#39;s been looking over pictures of the kids and...&quot; Jackie began to say before Ann interrupted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you heard from Fukushu? How are our daughters? What&#39;s going on over there? Are my babies okay?!&quot; Ann begged to know as she held her pie tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, I&#39;m sorry, but we don&#39;t know. It&#39;s really hurting me too. I don&#39;t know how any of my children are doing over there, and Aaron said he and Chase had plans for Thanksgiving, so he won&#39;t be able to attend either.&quot; Mika sighed, but the two still let the married couple into their home.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both remember my father, Hideo.&quot; Mika said as Hideo stood up with his cane and shook the ladies hands. The years had been kind to Hideo, but the years had caught up to him as his hair had turned grey and his legs were becoming weak and had to resort to using a cane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then of course is my brother, Shiro, and his lovely wife, Jennifer.&quot; Mika re-introduced everyone as they all headed to the table to eat their meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just us for the moment?&quot; Ann asked Claudia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Julia, Tammy, and Rick should be along soon. They were going to pick up Tammy from S.P.E.A.R. before they came over for the meal.<br />
<br />
Everyone was helping to set the table and pick out places to to sit down to begin eating their meal. They talked for a while about the past, and what everyone was up to. Jackie had become a child psychologist and it suited her, helping out kids that found themselves in tough spots like her when she was growing up. Ann was retired from her business, but living on years of long saved retirement.<br />
<br />
For Shiro and Jennifer, the couple found that living within the hustle of New York didn&#39;t quite suit them. The pair moved to the suburbs shortly after marrying, settling in a town called Darien along the Connecticut New York border. From there, they became the picture of suburban life. Shiro working as an accountant while Jennifer worked as his secretary. After almost 20 years of marriage, they had settled into a life of suburban bliss. Joining the PTA and attending their children&#39;s school activities. Ashley, their 16 year old soccer star, and Bobby, their 14 year old gamer and musician. Currently both kids sat watching TV, a little disappointed to not find their cousin Mason was here.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Mika, how&#39;s business?&quot; Jackie asked, desperately trying to change the subject. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I suppose,&quot; Mika shrugged. &quot;In December I&#39;ll be accompanying Lisa and Kumiko to New York for a fashion show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Ann smiled. &quot;What about you Claudia? Anything interesting going on with work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I work in the Town Clerk&#39;s office Ann,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;The most exciting thing about work is the lunch order.&quot;<br />
<br />
After an awkward conversation, everyone got settled and sat down at the Harris family dinner table, and Hideo suggested that everyone hold hands for prayer before they began eating their meal. Everyone wondered who should lead the prayer meal, and though they suggested Hideo, he insisted that his daughter in-law, Claudia, lead it, to which she obliged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, thank you for letting us all be here together, at least everyone who was able to make it, and those who are still on their way here. But more importantly we want to say a special prayer for those who are....away in another land, fighting for people who need hope and saving. We ask that you look over them and make sure they&#39;re protected. Stephanie, Anjelica, Kari, Haley, Mason, please let them all be....&quot; Claudia began to say before she heard two women crying and looked to see Mika and Ann crying into each other&#39;s arms as they had sat next to each other at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika, it&#39;ll....the children will be alright. They have Shizen and Tatsu there to look after them, along with Fukushu. None of them will let anything bad happen to any of them.&quot; Claudia said as she put a reassuring hand on her wife&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but....but Claudia, Anjelica and Mason are still so young. They haven&#39;t even.....they haven&#39;t even been in a school yard fight before, much less a war. We just want our babies to come home safe and sound!&quot; Ann said as she went back to crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel, we wouldn&#39;t have let them go if we didn&#39;t trust Fukushu. He may come off as grim most of the time, but he cares for the kids, he&#39;ll make sure they all come back to us in one piece.&quot; Jackie said patting a hand on her wife&#39;s shoulder to reassure her of their children&#39;s safety.<br />
<br />
They all heard the front door knock before opening as Rick Harris-Moreland, his wife, Julia Harris-Moreland, and their daughter, Tammy Harris-Moreland came into the house with food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi everyone, happy Thanksgiving, why don&#39;t we all dig in, because I am famished!&quot; Tammy said with a smile that looked like she was hiding something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy Harris-Moreland, tell your aunt Claudia and your aunt Mika what you did or I will and you won&#39;t be going back to S.P.E.A.R. anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom, I...&quot; Tammy began to argue with Julia before she saw her mother with her arms folded and glaring at her directly into her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so....uh, Aaron definitely won&#39;t be joining us for Thanksgiving. Neither will Chase for that matter.&quot; Tammy admitted to her family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mika asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because......Aaron and Chase went to the vampire realm a few hours ago.&quot; Tammy admitted as Mika and Claudia&#39;s eyes went wide after she said that.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!!!!!!!&quot; Mika and Claudia both shouted at Tammy.<br />
<br />
Now Mika and Claudia&#39;s increase in worry for their family had increased more than it was before. All four mothers now rushed the young co-ed, causing Tammy to back away in wide eyed fright.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean vampire realm?!&quot; Mika exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they get there?&quot; Ann moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Caleb or Connor know?&quot; Jackie asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck were you doing helping them Tammy?!&quot; Claudia exploded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia calm down,&quot; Julia shouted, stepping in between her daughter and sister. &quot;Tammy messed up, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Messed up?!&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;Julia! You do know my son hunts vampires right? And now him and his idiot friend are pulling some jackass level stupidity by going there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia turned red, sputtering as she tried to form a sentence. Seeing how flabbergasted her wife was, Mika placed a hand on her shoulder slowly moving her to the side. Now standing in front of Tammy, she glared into the taller teenage girls eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why did they go there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm I..I don&#39;t know,&quot; Tammy stammered. Mika furrowed her brow, causing Tammy to fidget in place. Gazing into Mika&#39;s eyes, Tammy could see the woman&#39;s eyes surging with power. While not magical herself, she had seen enough in her life to know when a wizard was angry. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think they have girlfriends!&quot;<br />
<br />
All sound now seemed to vanish within the Harris home. Everyone stared slack jawed at Tammy after her statement. Girlfriends? Aaron and Chase were dating vampires?<br />
<br />
It was Jackie who now shook herself from her delirium, the woman marching towards her cellphone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie what are you doing?&quot; Ann asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calling Duke,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;I&#39;m hoping he can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not calling Caleb?&quot; Ann asked.<br />
<br />
Jackie furrowed her brow, shaking her head no. &quot;If Caleb finds out that Chase and Aaron are in the vampire realm,&quot; she said. &quot;Then he won&#39;t stop until every vampire is turned to ash. Let&#39;s hope Duke can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while that&#39;s happening young lady,&quot; Claudia barked. &quot;You and I are going to have a serious talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Claudia!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia raised a hand, silencing Tammy. The cold now turning to her mother. &quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you this was a bad idea,&quot; Julia stated. &quot;Think about that next time you want to help your cousins hop dimensions for a booty call.&quot;<br />
<br />
As chaos now ran through the home, Ann and Mika turned to one another. Their children were in tremendous danger. Hopefully, they could fix this before anyone got hurt.</p>
