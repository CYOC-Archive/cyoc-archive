<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The others looked disgusted at Marks horrible way to torture Jeremy and realized that Aidan would be in the same predicament. But before any of them could say something their looks changed a bit calmer. Like Mark had said, to them the pacifier was a new one and the bib was freshly washed, so why should there be a problem. Only Aidan kept his sympathy for Jeremys fate, being in the same one.<br />
Grinning wide Mark then took the pacifier back out after it had finished changing and Jeremy had sucked it a few times. Jeremy gagged for a couple of seconds before he was able to talk again. “You are an asshole Mark. How can you torture Aidan like that and then plan to do the same to me? We don´t even have known each other before. What did Aidan or I do to deserve this?”<br />
The others wondered why Jeremy was so furious at Mark for just the simple get-up until now. But they had wanted an answer as to why he did it to Aidan.<br />
“Neither you or Aidan has done anything to me to earn this fate. With Aidan it was just that I had him at my mercy. It seems I have an sadistic streak in me and therefore like to torture others. Maybe you don´t have earned this and the others here would have more, but who says that their fate isn´t much crueler or more torturous than yours? Whatever I don´t need you to backtalk if I took out your pacifier. From now on you won´t be able to talk anymore, but will just make baby-noises and baby-talk instead. Maybe then it will be quieter.”<br />
“So you just need to have fun on our cost? You ag ja an aggo” said Jeremy, gaining a look of shock when his speech changed mid-sentence. The others looked shocked at Jeremy. But that shock would only grow after Marks next sentence. “Now that you are fully clothed as a baby and talk like one you should finally be one. So your body will regress into a baby of exactly four months old and stay so forever or until I change it again, being my second adopted baby brother. But you can have your pacifier back, Jeremy, not that its to big for you later.”<br />
Jeremy couldn´t stop his body from greedily taking back the pacifier, reapplying the bad taste to him. All around him had started to grow and he knows that he is shrinking down, regressing into a baby like Aidan had some time before. And he could do nothing against it.<br />
The others watched their friends regression into a baby. Nobody laughed at it. Even Jack feared what Mark would do with him when he would start. His underwear was still not empty and he could smell it, making him feel sick. He could never stand that smell, he had never visited his grandparents in their nursing home. He had tried, but only lasted a minute in the hall outside the many rooms before he bolted outside. He know his brother could stand it a bit better, he had gone there more times with their parents.<br />
When Jeremy had finally finished regressing Mark went over to the laptop on the stroller, adding that he could read Jeremys mind like Aidans and gained access to his memories before he switched over to looking at Jeremys changed profile, the extra points minimized so he just saw the basic stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Jeremy Smith (adopted)<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age body: 4 months (locked)<br />
Age mind: 27 years, 4 months<br />
Height: 1ft 5 inches<br />
Weight: 11 pounds<br />
Hair: Blond<br />
Eyes: Blue<br />
Orientation: Heterosexual<br />
Skin: Light Olive<br />
<br />
Only one statement was left to Mark before he deleted the “Mark rules” comment out of Jeremys profile, because he wouldn´t need it for him anymore. “Everything owned by Jeremy Smith before the regression will either vanish from existence or change his owner. Only the most important things to Jeremy will be transported to my home to decide what to do with them later.” Then he thought that it Aidan and Jeremy should be more similar as they are the same age, so he reduced Jeremys weight by one pound and added an inch to his height. He deleted the orientation and made his skin color light brown instead, just like with Aidan before. When that was changed he opened Aidans profile again, but just to copy the points under behavior and extra over to Jeremy. Adding the same password to the profile then he had to Aidans he saved the changes. In Aidans file he had included Jeremy with the bottles, meaning he would also taste them in different randomly chosen tastes. His favorite taste, apple juice was in the files beforehand.<br />
<br />
To anyone present they could only see Jeremy growing a little bit again and his skin taking a darker tone while he seemed calmer than before. Aidan could only guess what Mark had done now, but it was most likely that Mark just copied Aidans files to not be typing for longer. But he had no way he could think off to find out.<br />
Jeremy had more of it. Next to the outer changes he could see one of the books in the shelf just blur for him and he wasn´t able to say what the book was called. Then a feeling of calmness washed over him, letting his body relax. He regained movement, only to drop down, not able to push himself up again. He was confused why he wasn´t able to stand up and why his body was calm, but he could do nothing for now. Then to his embarrassment his body slowly crawled over to Aidan and the stroller while giggling happily around his pacifier.<br />
Mark took that as his cue to strap Jeremy in the stroller next to Aidan and both babies giggled with each other. “So, now Jeremy will only be able to crawl around and get calm near the stroller just like Aidan. And they look like twins from afar. The only difference beside their facial features is their hair color, the rest fits. And of course the different colored onesies.”<br />
That at least explained to both Aidan and Jeremy their unusual calmness. Mark looked a last time on Jeremys whole stats, only reducing the clothing parts and the objects.<br />

“Interesting, like Aidan his new family name added itself now.” Mark thought. Seeing everything as it should be, Mark closed both Jeremys and Aidans profile, not having a need for them at the moment. Then he turned to look at the others. &quot;So, let´s see who is next on the list.&quot; Mark said grinning. Nobody volunteered.</p>
