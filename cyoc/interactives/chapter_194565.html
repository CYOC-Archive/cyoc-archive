<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin pulled at his lips, stretching his mouth open wide to see the damage done to his teeth. The incisors on both top and bottom had clearly extended, pulling into dull points that pushed on his lips when his mouth was closed. Not to mention his new underbite. <i>Samantha will never want to kiss me again. I’m a fucking freak.</i> <br />
<br />
And his EARS. What the fuck? They jutted awkwardly from the side of his head, thick and at least 50% bigger than they had been, as little tufts of hair jutted from their depths. He closed his eyes and sighed, leaning his head against the mirror.<br />
<br />
He breathed in and out several times, trying to calm himself, though when he opened his eyes again the shakes started anew as he saw his naked feet again. His big toe on each foot looked as though they had been yanked down and inward, sticking out awkwardly and about twice the length they had been before. In fact, all of his toes looked a bit longer, though nothing quite as drastic as the big toes.<br />
<br />
He had sat pulling at them a while, trying to pull them back into position, wondering if they’d popped out of their sockets or something. Could that even happen with toes? Did he really fuck them up or something? They didn’t hurt, but they looked WRONG. He tried to bend them and found that they were quite dexterous, but that made him feel weird so he stopped.<br />
<br />
Bracing himself, he looked in the mirror again, trying to see if there were any other changes. Nothing really? It was hard to tell, as his head still throbbed from his hangover. He maybe looked more hairy? He turned to the side. <i>Oh yeah. Fuck, that too.</i><br />
<br />
His tailbone had apparently unfused from his pelvis and stuck out about 3 inches. While he wondered if he could move it on his own, he really wasn’t sure if he wanted to find out. <i>Then he wouldn’t be able to pretend it wasn’t real anymore.</i> Denial suited him today.<br />
<br />
What didn’t suit him, however, was being butt fucking naked. He made a face at the blue-and-white Hawaiian Shirt that lay crumpled on the bed from where he’d thrown it earlier in a huff. It was responsible for this, some how. He knew. But it was clothing.<br />
<br />
He picked it up and put it on, buttoning it up. He tried pulling at the hem to see if he could get it to cover his dick and balls and contemplated the position he’d have to walk in. <i>NOPE NOT HAPPENING.</i> He took it off and looked it over in his hands before he tried stepping through the arm holes as though they were ridiculous pants. If he buttoned them up and bunched the fabric up, it looked like a ridiculous diaper, but it at least kept his naughty bits covered.<br />
<br />
He threw his head back and groaned before stepping into the hallway. He just needed to make it to his car, so he could go home, get some different clothes, and go to the Emergency Room. <i>He could do this...</i><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
His scream had apparently woken up the blockchain of rooms. A natural morning person, he had been the first to wake, notice his stuff was missing, and lose his shit.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck dude, keep it down. I’m trying to sleep he…where’s my door? OH MY GOD <i>WHAT THE FUCK.</i>”<br />
<br />
Basically that. Times 15. He’d been relieved to know that he wasn’t the only one going through this fucking nightmare. Everyone’s doors had been removed. Everyone’s stuff was missing. Everyone had fucked up shit happening to their bodies. They varied slightly, but it was all close enough to be concerning.<br />
<br />
Well, more concerning than, well you know. THE FACT THAT THEIR BODIES WERE FUCKING CHANGING AGAINST THEIR FUCKING WILL.<br />
<br />
He slapped his face a couple times. Come on, dude. <i>Find your inner Zen.</i> God, why was it so hard to think this morning?<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
A few of the other guys were milling about already, in various states of undress. Oh yeah. In addition to having their shit stolen, everyone had been given a new “wardrobe” that matched the picture they had created for themselves. The reason they were all here in the first place. At least he fared better than some of the others. One guy, Brett, had given his Ape Frat dude only a Puka Shell Necklace. 1 - BORING and 2 - GOOD LUCK BEING NAKED YOU STUPID FUCK.<br />
<br />
Wow. He was being kind of a bitch today…<br />
<br />
Kevin’s face dropped, however, when he saw Brett sitting at the table with his bedsheets wrapped around his waist.<br />
<br />
…oh. I mean, that was a pretty good idea…<br />
<br />
He blinked down at his ridiculous Hawaiian Shirt Diaper looking getup and turned around, his toes slapping on the concrete floor as he walked back to his room, soon returning with his sheets around his waist and wearing the shirt like a shirt. Buttoned Up. He had taken a couple of extra minutes to fold the sheets to hide the stain from where he had wiped up his semen the night prior.<br />
<br />
Ok now to business. He made his way to the double doors with the full intention of giving Tad a piece of his mind now that he was halfway decent. But by the time he arrived, he was horrified to see that there were no inside handles on the doors. He quickly searched the cracks, his fingers not finding any purchase. He hit the door.<br />
<br />
“TAD! <i>TAAAAAAAD</i> TAD! Let me out! I have a complaint about this place. I’m not going to give it a good review!”<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
“Come on Tad, I’m sorry for being a dick yesterday. Please?”<br />
<br />
Still nothing.<br />
<br />
“I get it, you FUCKING PRICK. This is ILLEGAL.”<br />
<br />
He slammed his hands against the wall and jumped up and down, screeching at the top of his lungs.<br />
<br />
<i>Still</i> still nothing.<br />
<br />
Defeated, he returned to the Commissary as his stomach rumbled. He needed a banana and he needed alcohol.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s heart fluttered when he saw Marcus lounging, cool as a cucumber, in the sitting room next to the Commissary. He felt embarrassed about that, as he took stock of the jock’s changes, walking up and lifting his chin slightly. “Sup, dude.”<br />
<br />
Marcus had already had a bit of an underbite, so that wasn’t too big of a deal. If anything it just squared his jaw out even further. His Mutton chops had maybe grown? He definitely had more stubble on his chin than he did yesterday, but that could just be because his razor had been taken? His ears DID look bigger, but they actually looked kind of cute on him. Especially since he still had his baseball cap on, turned backwards.<br />
<br />
He blinked and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
They looked <i>alright</i>, he guessed.<br />
<br />
As his gaze went lower, he couldn’t see any other real changes as Marcus had been wearing his sheets, not like a dress or a towel, but like a fucking TOGA.<br />
<br />
<b>WHAT A FUCKING GENIUS.</b><br />
<br />
“Dude! A toga? Haha that’s awesome.” He reached out with a fist bump, hoping it felt natural.<br />
<br />
Marcus grinned widely. “Thanks, bro! When my shit was gone, I just figured I’d just wear the sheets!” He stood up and turned around in a circle, as Kevin noticed that his feet also looked a little weird.<br />
<br />
He wondered if Marcus had the beginnings of a tail? Right above his nice, juicy…<br />
<br />
Anyway! He grinned and briefly pulled off his sheet, trying to keep his bits covered. “Can you show me how you tied that? It’s much better than dragging around all over the ground.” He hoped Marcus wouldn’t notice the cumstains…<br />
<br />
Satisfied, he went over to grab himself and Marcus a beer while the other guys lined up, and soon everyone was wearing a toga. In fact, it became a sort of group ritual as Marcus would roll it up and show how it went around the arm, etc.<br />
<br />
“TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!”<br />
<br />
He handed over a stein of Lager to Marcus and walked over to grab a banana from the food bar, easily tearing off the stem and barely pulling the peel down before biting into it with a laugh, his sharper teeth feeling awkward as he chewed. This was fucking hilarious.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
And so the day went, as everyone leaned into the alcohol as escapism for their situation. At one point, they were all in the Gymnasium having a weight lifting competition, trying to see how many bicep curls they could do WHILE chugging an entire stein of beer as the rest of the guys watched, hanging from the jungle gyms. Kevin had volunteered to be one of the beer runners with Marcus.<br />
<br />
&quot;TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!&quot;<br />
<br />
Certain that they had finally brought enough beer for everyone, they sat next to each other on the floor, as Marcus pulled Kevin into a bro-hug, their dirty togas spread out over them and the floor.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt a jolt of pleasure as the next two contestants took their places at the stands, sloshing beer all over the equipment. It was only now that he realized he’d been sporting a massive erection as Marcus had reached under his toga to pull awkwardly at the head and shaft.<br />
<br />
<i>He leaned his head back into Marcus, breathing deeply and feeling a bit dizzy from the drinks he&#39;d had.</i><br />
<br />
“Ahhhhh. Ohhhhhhh, dude!”<br />
<br />
<i>…as Marcus’ hand worked him up and down under the sheet.</i><br />
<br />
“Uhhhh. Ohhhhh. Ooooooh. Bro, don’t stop…”<br />
<br />
<i>…Up and down. Up and down. He felt Marcus’ dick jutting against his back…</i><br />
<br />
“Ooooh. Ooh. Ooh.”<br />
<br />
<i>…He closed his eyes, gritting his teeth as he grunted, trying to catch his breath.</i><br />
<br />
“Ooh….Oooh….Oo ooh…”<br />
<br />
<i>…As Marcus pinched his nipples with both of his hands, which were hugged just under his arms while he expertly pulled at his dick.</i><br />
<br />
“Oo oo…Ah-uh-ah, ooh…”<br />
<br />
<i>Breathing deeply he glanced under his sheet…No wait, Marcus was jerking him off with his foot, the big toe having grown out further from this morning into what looked like a thumb.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Wait, no something was wrong.</b><br />
<br />
“Unnnnngh!” He threw his head back into Marcus as his vision whited out, his cock spasming as Marcus continued to pump his shaft with his foot-hand.<br />
<br />
“Good job, Bro. That was a big one!”</p>
