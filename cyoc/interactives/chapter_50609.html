<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah had been carried away on a litter by two eunuchs, while Milan <br />
ran ahead to draw her bath. Jo-jo had been ordered to give Jeff a foot <br />
massage while Bongo and Fizzy continued to massage Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, boys, you're doing a great job.  I bet Tim would enjoy a massage <br />
too. Can you boys back up this massage equipment and take it and me <br />
over to Tim Murray's house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, master,&quot; Jo-jo said eagerly as he stood up from where he'd <br />
been licking the soles of Jeff's feet, &quot;Can I be one of the ponies <br />
today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ponies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pony boys that pull your surrey. You'll need at least two, and two <br />
can run behind carrying the massage table and supplies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused. He wasn't sure if it was wise to have naked men running <br />
through the town, even if the Chronivac was supposed to make their <br />
existence acceptable, he wasn't sure how the police would cope with <br />
nudity laws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot; asked Jo-jo nervously.  He glanced over at the heavy whips and <br />
canes hanging on the back of the door. He hoped he had not overstepped <br />
his bounds by asking to be a pony slave today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you boys run through the streets naked?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, sir!&quot; Jo-jo answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then get ready to go!&quot; snapped Jeff, &quot;And Jo-Jo you can be a pony, <br />
pick one of the others to be a pony too.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat on the table with the sheet wrapped around him and was amazed <br />
at the latex and leather suits and harnesses that Jo-Jo and Bongo <br />
dressed in.  They wore black skintight tights with a hole in the <br />
bottoms. Latex dildos with horsetails attached were inserted through <br />
the holes. Hoof-like boots contained their feet. Their arms were <br />
hidden under the heavy sleeveless latex shirt and a horse-head hood <br />
covered their heads, their lower jaws remained visible with steel bits <br />
and leather harnesses visible. Jeff marveled at their speedy <br />
transformation.<br />
<br />
Fizzy had unshackled Go-go, and they both stood there in pvc black <br />
short shorts with black mesh tank tops and black leather running <br />
shoes.  Their necklaces had been replaced with heavy black leather <br />
posture collars with large cow bells hanging from each collar. The <br />
cowbells had a not-so-hidden-compartment at the top which undoubtedly <br />
contained the testicle necklace that each slave had worn earlier. The <br />
word SLAVE was inscribed on each cowbell.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Fizzy and Go-go dressed Jeff in clean clothes, and carried <br />
him on their shoulders downstairs.  The staircase was a tight fit for <br />
them, and Jeff was concerned about the loud clomping of Jo-Jo and <br />
Bongo behind them.  He half expected the hooded horse slaves to trip <br />
and fall, but they didn't.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, he was ensconced in the carriage with two horse slaves <br />
harnessed to the front. He was handed the reins, and then Fizzy and <br />
Go-go dashed inside with their bells jangling. They would get the <br />
massage table and stuff, and run to catch up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gidyap!&quot; ordered Jeff shaking the reins. <br />
<br />
The surrey lurched forward and out of the garage.<br />
<br />
Jeff's eyes widened as they pulled on to the street.  The Chronivac <br />
was a lot more powerful than he realized.  To make a world where <br />
Joshua could legally be a eunuch slave, the Chronivac had changed the <br />
entire world.<br />
<br />
Several carriages traveling in opposite directions rolled by pulled by <br />
slaves dressed in various garbs and harnesses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jeff, beautiful evening for a ride, isn't it?  I do love <br />
daylight savings,&quot; said Mrs. Worth as she cracked her whip across the <br />
backs of her pony slaves. &quot;Don't slow down! Gidyap!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Mrs. Worth, have a good ride!&quot; Jeff called.<br />
<br />
As the surrey rolled down the street, Jeff paused to wonder who all <br />
the pony-slaves were. They were all well-muscled, though not of the <br />
uniform height that his eunuchs were. For that matter, from the bulges <br />
in some of the shorts he saw on the slaves, most of them were not <br />
eunuchs.<br />
<br />
About a block from Tim's house, Jeff heard the clanging of cowbells <br />
and knew that Go-Go and Fizzy were catching up.<br />
<br />
Tim was not as enthusiastic as Jeff had expected when he arrived at <br />
Tim's house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, I thought you'd enjoy a slave massage!&quot; Jeff snapped shocked by <br />
his buddy's ingratitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose I could if it wasn't going to be me in the collar in <br />
three years.  Since it'll be you too, I don't know why you're so eager <br />
to enjoy your slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean me too?  I'm not a slave, and I don't intend to be <br />
one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you don't impress me as a ROTC type, and military service is <br />
the only way to avoid mandatory slave service at the age of 21.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, when I turn 21, I become a slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, only for five years, unless you are accepted into the military <br />
and get exempted, or if you're dumb enough to try sneaking over the <br />
border into Mexico like Josh and his frat brothers did. Then you're a <br />
slave for life, and get all those special surgeries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Special surgeries? You mean the castrations?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Your parents insisted that all the slaves be eunuchs if they were <br />
going to be the house with Sarah.  They just didn't know that you'd <br />
already bought Joshua's slave contract when they said that. I'm <br />
referring to the brain surgeries that make them such obedient slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brain surgery?  I thought they were just well trained. They don't <br />
have scars on their heads!&quot; Jeff protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, they use long steel rods and shove them up the slave's nose. They <br />
technique goes back to ancient Egypt.  It's how they got their slaves <br />
to so energetically build pyramids and stuff. Unfortunately, the <br />
technique was lost for ages until it was rediscovered in the 1920's <br />
when they unearthed the hidden room behind King Tut's tomb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Tim, I have a confession to make. None of this is real, you see <br />
I used a Chronivac on Josh and his buddies, and they'll turn back in <br />
two days, and then this will all be over. So we'd better enjoy it <br />
while we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You used a Chronivac? You idiot, Jeff, didn't you read the warnings, <br />
the directions?  Oh, man, yeah, Joshua will revert to your annoying <br />
jock brother, maybe he won't be a eunuch, but he'll still be a slave - <br />
that is unless he wasn't really 21 yet and you made him 21.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? No, you've got it wrong, all physical and mental attributes will <br />
return to normal.  It said so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it also says that any adjustments to reality will permanent <br />
, and to exercise due caution before making any transformations that <br />
will alter the fabric of reality,&quot; Tim scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wrong, Tim, I've got my Chronivac with me. I'll show you. <br />
Let's set it up in your room.&quot;</p>
