<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sat on the edge of his bed, bewildered at the thought that he had caused his <br />
foster brother to regress in puberty. As he sat and pondered how any of this <br />
could be possible, he didn't notice the dazzling light which filled the opposite <br />
side of his room. He remained oblivous as from the light appeared a large <br />
anthromorphic lion with pure white fur and brilliant blue eyes. It wasn't until the <br />
creature stood directly in front of him and cleared its throat loudly that the young <br />
boy was awakened from his thoughtful stupor and turned his attention to the <br />
strange apparition. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Tyler,&quot; the personified feline greeted him. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-who are you?!&quot; Ty jumped back into the furthest corner of the bed in a fetal <br />
position, his eyes wide with terror and befuddlement. &quot;How do you know my <br />
name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peace, child,&quot; the creature said soothingly as it sat on the edge of the bed. &quot;I <br />
am sure you are afraid and confused; I understand. However, I am here to <br />
explain things to you, so please control yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty regained his composure and released himself from his self-created cocoon. <br />
However, he did not move any closer to the lion. <br />
<br />
&quot;I fear that my true name would be much too difficult for you to pronounce,&quot; the <br />
creature chuckled, &quot;so why don't you think of something to call me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Ty said, &quot;Aslan? That's pretty cheesy, but I'll remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aslan? You're right, that is rather cheesy. But it will suffice. Now, I am here to <br />
explain to you many things. You must pay close attention to what I am about to <br />
say. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. You see, Tyler, this world is but a small part of a large universe. There <br />
are many other planets and solar systems out there with life on them far <br />
different from yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're an alien?&quot; Ty asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, let me finish. There are also many universes parallel to this one. Many <br />
different planes of existance exist which have different physics and laws. And <br />
beyond these there is a special place called the Order Space. It is both visible <br />
and invisible; tangible and intangible; everything and nothing; all at the same <br />
time. It is the dimension where all of the others connect. In this Order Space <br />
reside super-powerful beings that look over their respective worlds and insure <br />
they remain stable. I am responsible for this planet. Now, if I haven't fried your <br />
brain already, I will tell you your part in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded in shocked wonder; was he really going to be a part of something so <br />
grand?<br />
<br />
&quot;When one of us decides it is time, we relinquish our powers to one of the <br />
inhabitants of our worlds. We teach them everything we know so that they may <br />
take our place in the Order. I have chosen you. You will inherit my powers and <br />
become the new keeper of Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I don't want to?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is too late, you have already been given power. But I do not believe that you <br />
would rather stay here with an abusive foster family than become a super <br />
being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is true,&quot; Ty admitted. &quot;So what will I have to do to become part of this <br />
Order?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite simple, really. I'll bring you to the Order Space where a council of the <br />
most powerful super beings will judge you. If you are deemed acceptable, <br />
which I am sure you will be, I will give you my full power and transfer all of my <br />
knowledge to you. Once that is done, I will be placed back into the time stream <br />
where I was taken out by my predecessor and you will take my place among <br />
the Order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Ty conceded, &quot;So when do we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are already there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked around to see that his bed was now floating in an indescribable realm <br />
of alternating appearances. It seemed that the place was constantly changing <br />
from one landscape to another; most were strange and alien, but a few familiar <br />
or similar to Earth. Ty's mind was having difficulty taking in his surroundings, so <br />
he tried to focus on Aslan. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite overwhelming for the first time,&quot; Aslan chuckled, &quot;But don't worry, <br />
you'll get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bed seemed to be stationary, but Ty saw other objects floating by in the <br />
endless space. He couldn't tell whether they were moving, or he was. But his <br />
attention was now drawn to a huge structure coming closer and closer. As they <br />
neared it, Ty saw that it was an enourmous judge's stand whereat sat seven <br />
large creatures. Each of them was the same pure white as Aslan, but they were <br />
all different creatures. The one in the middle, and clearly in charge, looked like <br />
a dragon, but with human arms and legs, a wolvish head, and great antlers that <br />
stretched beyond his snout. To his right sat a muscular nine-tailed kitsune and <br />
to his left a busty gryphon woman. The other judges were apparently creatures <br />
from other universes as Ty couldn't recognize, or even describe, any of them. <br />
<br />
Aslan stepped off the bed, but remained floating in the semi-void. He suddenly <br />
grew to the size of the other creatures leaving Ty feeling small and alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keeper of Earth,&quot; the dragon thing stated in a booming voice, &quot;You have filed <br />
your resignation with this council. We will begin your hearing for your potential <br />
replacement. Keeper of Ytl&uuml;ng, you may begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gryphon woman stood up, her breasts bouncing a bit and making Ty feel <br />
weird. She adressed Aslan in a soft but powerful voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keeper of Earth, you have chosen your replacement. Would you please inform <br />
the council of how long you have monitored him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have watched him since his birth 15 Earth years ago, or 1.5 Order years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, and how is his character?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is kind-hearted, but he has been with an abusive family for the past four <br />
years. He has had some troubles, but I believe him more than capable to rise <br />
above them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what of your power and knowledge have you already given him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave him power enough to perform one change and have told him a basic <br />
overview of the Order's existance and purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will now leave this court,&quot; the dragon creature picked up again, &quot;so that <br />
we may evaluate your replacement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Keeper of Gœral,&quot; Aslan nodded and disappeared from sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Earth child,&quot; the dragon addressed Ty, &quot;Please rise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was afraid to leave the bed, but he was more afraid of the creatures in front <br />
of him. So he took a leap of faith and stood up off of the bed. He was amazed <br />
that he did not fall, even though he had seen Aslan do it not long ago. He stood <br />
there in the huge realm and looked high up to the creatures at the stand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keeper of Fenc&oslash;ql, you may begin evaluation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitsune stood up and passed through the stand. As he approached Ty, he <br />
shrunk down to the size that Aslan had been. <br />
<br />
{Human, I will be evaluating your potential to become a member of the order,} <br />
came a telepathic voice from the kitsune. {In order to do so, one of my tails <br />
must connect with your mind. Please do not fight it. Just relax.}<br />
<br />
Before Ty could even consider what this meant, the kitsune thrust forth one of <br />
his nine tails and it touched Ty on the forehead. Suddenly, Ty was taken to yet <br />
another realm, this one was a simple black void which pulsed a pure white <br />
periodically. Ty and the kitsune were the only ones here and could see each <br />
other even when their surroundings were completely dark. <br />
<br />
{This is the Plane of Truth,} the kitsune explained. {In this place, we are <br />
stripped to our bare selves. No, not your clothes...}<br />
<br />
Ty had reacted to the word stripped and checked to see that his clothes were <br />
still there. Just because these creatures were unabashed in their modesty didn't <br />
mean he was.<br />
<br />
{...I meant your character. Within this realm no lie can be told, no prejudice can <br />
exist. We are simply us and will be judged on that alone. I sense your fear and <br />
nervousness. Be calm, you can come to no harm here.}<br />
<br />
Ty tried to relax, taking deep breaths and closing his eyes. <br />
<br />
{Much better,} the kitsune reassured him. {You are a kind and generous <br />
person. Your spirit is that of a child who only wishes for accpetance and love. <br />
You do not like your current foster family, but you bear no grudges against <br />
them. Your anger towards them comes from frustration, not hate. You wish that <br />
they could see their faults and change, you do not wish them harm. <br />
Forgiveness is important to you, as well as morals and justice.}<br />
<br />
The two were back in the Order Space in front of the council. <br />
<br />
{You pass.}<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then,&quot; the dragon stated. &quot;Keeper of Earth, you may return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aslan reappeared as the kitsune returned to his former size and went back to <br />
his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keeper of Earth, this child's character has been established as accpetable to <br />
replace you. The council will now vote aye or nay to permit or decline his <br />
accpetance. Keeper of Ytl&uuml;ng...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; the dragon voted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keeper of Fenc&oslash;ql...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; said the kitsune. <br />
<br />
The rest of the council voted in unanimous ayes and the dragon stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;This coucil has found your replacement acceptable. Child, do you agree to <br />
become the new keeper of Earth?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had been fighting a mental battle with himself while the council had voted. <br />
When the time came for him to answer, he had finally decided to say, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand that you will be responsible for the well-being of your <br />
planet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you uphold the sacred task of keeping order within your jurisdiction?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand that you cannot leave this position unless you are <br />
banished or have served a term of 100 million Order years, which would be 1 <br />
billion Earth years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, by the authority of this council, you are hereby decreed the new Keeper <br />
of Earth. R&agrave;cs&aacute;g&aelig;d&auml;m, you may relinquish your knowledge and power to your <br />
successor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aslan shrunk back down to Ty's size and took his hand in his paw. He <br />
positioned their arms so that it looked like they were about to arm wrestle. A <br />
bright light enveloped the two of them and Ty felt his mind surge with infinite <br />
knowledge while his body flowed with unlimited power. As the light faded, so <br />
did Aslan, and Ty then grew to the size of the other super beings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, Keeper of Earth. Before you may begin your duties, however, <br />
you may choose to alter your form. Whether you do or not, you will become the <br />
pure white which signifies you as a member of the Order. You will also be <br />
required to relinquish your clothing, as Order members are required to have <br />
modesty and simplicity. This will also be an exercise for your new power. <br />
Proceed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty knew that the form he chose would be the one he was stuck with; at least <br />
for this realm and for the next billion Earth years. After a long consideration, he <br />
chose to be...</p>
