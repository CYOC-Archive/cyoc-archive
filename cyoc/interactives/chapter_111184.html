<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna is perplexed. She laughs, thinking the old man was joking or something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right. You can&#39;t possibly know anything about me or my boyfriend, what are you saying?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I do actually. Did you notice I called you by your name even though you never told it to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s true I guess... but how? How do you know my name, have we met before? I don&#39;t have the greatest memory to be honest.&quot; Anna admits. <br />
<br />
&quot;No miss, we haven&#39;t actually met in person, though I was pretty sure you must be Anna. He spoke to me a lot about you, showed me pictures too. Your boyfriend Joe that is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know Joe?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I do. Strange guy he is, I&#39;ll tell you that much. Not that I should be the one to talk about strange, with this little peculiar shop of mine heh heh. Anyway Anna, your Joe is a regular customer of mine. Well not actually customer, he never actually bought anything, but he comes by often. At first he just looked around for a few minutes then he left without saying a word. But after a few such visits I thought I&#39;d ask him if he needs some help, and we started talking. He told me about himself, about you, and he also talked to me reluctantly about a... big problem of his. You see Anna, Joe has a really weird fetish if I do say so myself, he&#39;s one of the weirdest people I ever had in my shop...&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;I knew it, I just knew he was hiding something from me! Ugh, why doesn&#39;t he trust me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that he doesn&#39;t trust you Anna, you see he&#39;s deeply, sincerely in love with you, trust me on that one. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s ashamed, he&#39;s afraid to come clean with you on this... strange fetish of his, if we can even call it that. Now I don&#39;t want to allarm you, but he did tell me that this little problem of his might lead to a crisis in your relationship.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?! But if he loves me so much, what&#39;s the problem? I don&#39;t get it.&quot; Anna seems pretty upset now, tension visible in her beautiful blue eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think I better tell you everything. As I said, Joe is deeply in love with you, he couldn&#39;t even imagine living without you Anna, but... the problem is, Joe discovered he&#39;s actually bisexual, leaning much on the gay side. Anna, your boyfriend found out he likes men more than women.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no this can&#39;t be true. Tell me you&#39;re joking!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious. He told me you are without a doubt his soulmate, he could only ever love you, Anna, and that life with you is perfect except for well, sex. He reluctantly admitted that he wished you could be a man when you two are intimate. He said he feels really guilty about this though and he&#39;s afraid that if he&#39;d tell you you&#39;d get angry and leave him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My head is spinning. I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m hearing, this is... this is really screwed up. What the hell am I gonna do? Oh god...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anna, let me ask you something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, ask me whatever.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you love your boyfriend?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I, I do. I really do, believe me!&quot; A tear runs down Anna&#39;s cheek as she says this. <br />
<br />
&quot;And would you do anything to save your relationship with him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...yes. Yes, anything! I love him, I love him so much!&quot; <br />
<br />
The old man smiles, he seems moved by her sincere words. &quot;Okay. Then I think I can help you... As I said, I know just what you need. Please follow me into the back of the shop.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna follows the old man in the back part of the place, her head still spinning from the shocking revelations. The place was terribly dark, but then the old man switches on a light and Anna lets out a startled gasp. The room appeared to be filled with... dead bodies. Naked, inanimate bodies layed out on what appeared to be metallic medical tables. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? Are these... dead people?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hah hah, no no my dear, don&#39;t panic, please. These aren&#39;t real people, they&#39;re just costumes!&quot; The old man goes near one of the apparent corpses, a fairly attractive brunette woman, and lifts her up, revealing a slit along her back. She appeared to be hollow on the inside, though she certainly wasn&#39;t just a fake skin. She looked solid, substantial, like there was also muscle and fat beneath the skin, and what could be seen through the slit on her back was a reddish and wet cavity. Looked disgustingly much like actual flesh. <br />
<br />
&quot;These... costumes are awfully realistic&quot; Anna comments. &quot;She looks creepily life like. Eww!&quot; She goes as she tentatively touches the hand of the inanimate, eyeless woman. &quot;Feels like real flesh too.&quot; <br />
<br />
The old man looked amused. &quot;Yes well these are very realistic and sophisticated costumes in fact, miss Anna. Made to look and feel like real people, made of real flesh. They have certain realistic functions too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is pretty disturbing. So you were saying you could help me, with Joe?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. Now Anna, as I told you, what Joe would want if for you to be a male when you have sex. What you need is one of these special costumes. To change your gender and become a male while you wear it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... never in my life even remotely considered getting a sex change. I&#39;m really not liking where this is going, but I really do love Joe... and if this is what it takes to prove it to him... I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m kind of angry at him right now, but my love is stronger I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
The old man takes Anna gently by her arm and takes her to a costume in particular. Anna raises her eyebrows and makes a nervous laugh when she sees it. It looked like a pudgy, nerdy teenage boy, with freckles on his chubby face, curly, shortly cropped reddish hair. His ears were kind of funny and big and he had a bit of teen facial scruff, mostly on his upper lip. His body was soft and pasty, with a rounded belly, a bit of man boobs and his hands were a bit meaty with stubby fingers. His penis was kind of thick and short, though not really that small, and surrounded by thick, curly reddish pubes. He looked like a regular nerd, a loser, Anna thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this? Why are you showing me this unattractive boy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well your boyfriend doesn&#39;t find him so unattractive. I know, unconventional tastes I guess, but I&#39;m sure this is exactly the costume he would like. He always goes to look at Owen here, when he visits the store.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you can&#39;t be serious! THIS is what Joe is attracted to? THIS is what he&#39;d prefer I looked like? A, a, a fat nerd boy? He has a slim, blonde, good looking girlfriend and he wants THIS?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems so. I&#39;m sorry Anna. He talked to me a lot about this, trust me. He said it would be great to be with this boy...Owen, but only if he knew it was you under his skin.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna couldn&#39;t believe what she just did, but she actually bought &quot;Owen&quot;. She left the store and ordered the heavy, life sized costume to be delivered at her apartment. She must be going crazy, she thought, but she loved Joe, she really did, no matter how screwed up this was. He wanted &quot;Owen&quot;? Then she wants to do her best to become &quot;Owen&quot;! <br />
<br />
That same evening she went out, alone, to shop for some new clothes. She loved buying clothes, shoes and accessories, but this time it would be different. She was going to buy men&#39;s clothes. To wear when she&#39;ll become &quot;Owen&quot;... <br />
While going to the shopping mall, Anna was texting with Joe on her smartphone. She didn&#39; tell him anything obviously, but she casually chatted with him, lightheartedly asking stuff so she can make out what &quot;Owen&quot; might like to wear. So she started joking about nerds and what&#39;s nerdy, and she discovered Joe got pretty chatty. &quot;Bow ties are cool&quot; was one of the texts she got from her boyfriend. She also discovered suspenders, prim and neatly buttoned up shirts, and glasses might be winners. <br />
Anna felt really out of place buying all these geeky men&#39;s stuff, but she went through with it and when she left for home, she hid the shopping bags in her wardrobe, even if she did live alone and it&#39;s not like anyone could see them... <br />
<br />
Anna didn&#39;t sleep very well that night. She cried in bed and she had a few bad dreams which caused her to wake up with a bit of a headache. She got out of bed and went in front of her full length mirror. Her eyes looked a bit tired, sure, and her long blonde hair was a bit uncombed, but she sure looked very attractive. Her body was practically perfect, slim and smooth skinned, her face was just plain beautiful, and she looked damn sexy in just her red silk bra and panties. Anna took the brush and began combing her hair while thinking &quot;How the hell can Joe be unsatisfied with the gorgeous girlfriend he has?&quot; <br />
<br />
She got dressed in a pair of skin tight black leggings, a red tube top that left a good portion of cleavage, and black high heeled shoes and she went into the kitchen to make herself a cup of coffee. She was exchanging loving text messages with Joe when she heard the doorbell ring. She opens up and it was a delivery guy. It seems &quot;Owen&quot; arrived... <br />
Anna signs the form and the delivery guy leaves as she takes the large box containing the costume inside, moving it in the middle of her small living room. She drinks her coffee while she reflects on what she was about to do. She felt nervous, unsure and even a bit upset, but she had to go through with this. For Joe. For love. She had told Joe to come over by her place after he gets out from work, so she had until 7 o&#39;clock this evening to complete her &quot;transformation&quot;... Boy, what a surprise Joe was in for, she thinks and for a brief moment she smiles. <br />
<br />
Anna carefully cuts open the cardboard box and there he was, &quot;Owen&quot; the nerdy fat boy, sitting still like a cold corpse. Along him was an instruction manual, fortunately. Anna takes the lifeless naked boy out from the box and with some effort she plops him face down on the sofa, with the slit on his back facing upwards. She picks up the instruction manual and begins reading a few things. <br />
<br />
Apparently this was a bit more than just a mere costume, Anna learns, it apparently is very sophisticated and permits a lot of realistic functions. Apparently while wearing it, she&#39;ll be able to feel through its flesh as if it were her own, her voice would be altered and... she&#39;ll be able to get erections, feel sexual pleasure from the penis and even expell sperm when orgasming! To wear the costume one must merely enter it through the opening in the back and it should fit your body like a glove. Once the costume&#39;s sensors feel the wearer&#39;s body heat, the slit will weld and seal itself on its own. To remove the costume one must simply tug and pull on the skin behind the neck or nape of the head, and apply some force. It only hurts slightly until at least a minimal portion of the costume detaches from the wearer&#39;s skin, afterwards it immediately disconnects from the wearer and all sensorial links are interrupted. Continue to tug on the skin to recreate the slit along the back and simply exit the costume the way one entered it. &quot;This is truly disturbing&quot; She thinks, &quot;And I guess Joe knew these things pretty well.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steeling herself, she decides she&#39;s going to do this. She removes her clothes, her high heels, her bra and her panties and swallows hard before she grabs the sides of the costume&#39;s slit, opening it wide. The wet, flesh colored interior really did not look inviting, but mustering all her courage she starts inserting her right leg inside... Anna feels a bit queasy at the sensation of inserting her leg inside of what felt like a tight, wet, fleshy tunnel, but with an effort of will she continued without pause. <br />
She pushed her leg all the way in, then her other leg. Then she pulled the lifeless flabby upper body upright and inserted her slender pale arms into the costumes thick soft ones, with her dainty fingers ending up inside &quot;Owen&quot;s chunky short fingers. Next came the head. It was a pretty gross sensation as the sticky wet insides on the costume&#39;s face pressed against her features, and she tried not to gag as she took her hands to her back to push the floppy suit as closed as she could. <br />
<br />
Then it happened. As if a wound healing itself in accelerated rhythm, the slit on the suit&#39;s back closed up, leaving behind no sign of a scar. Anna screamed when she felt something meaty suddenly entering her vagina, and then she felt ants and stings all over, as the suit&#39;s flesh came alive. She realized she could now feel the cold parquet underneath her naked, chunky feet, and the air in the room on her new skin... <br />
<br />
Anna ran with heavy steps inside her room, ignoring the feeling of her flabby body jittering all over, and she sat down at her vanity table, heart pounding like mad as she met eyes with her reflection in the mirror. It was unbelievable, and deeply disturbing. She looked just like him now. Owen. She was inside him. She put her chubby hands on her round soft face, pushing, pressing and pinching. It felt real, disturbingsly real. She tried plucking out one of the boy&#39;s facial hairs and she let out an &quot;OWW!!&quot; as she felt the sting of pain. Her voice was now lower, and a bit nasal, and unmistakably masculine. She looked at her flabby male chest and her round pudgy belly, covered with sparse curly body hair, then lowered her eyes and saw the penis and scrotum. She tentatively touched it with a trembling hand and boy was it sensitive. She got startled and disturbed so she stopped. She looked back at her new face in the mirror, feeling sick and unclean, like she&#39;s done something terribly wrong.  It was all too much for Anna. The apparent teenage boy begins sobbing incontrollably, head down on the table and face buried in hands. She cried continuously for almost an hour before collapsing to sleep. <br />
<br />
When Anna wakes up she&#39;s a bit confused. She sees her fat male arms and hands though and she remembers. She&#39;s in the costume. She&#39;s Owen the teen boy. She suddenly remembers about Joe coming over at 7 o&#39;clock, and she quickly runs back into the living room to retrieve her smartphone. She looks at the time. I&#39;ts almost 4 o&#39;clock. Phew, there&#39;s still some time. Anna still has to get dressed and she intends preparing a surprise dinner for her and Joe. <br />
<br />
Returning to her bedroom, Anna takes out the shopping bags with the men&#39;s clothes she bought yesterday and lays them all out on the bed. She then proceeds to dress Owen&#39;s chunky body. She puts on socks and a pair of white and blue striped briefs. Then she puts on the brown baggy slacks and begins buttoning up the light blue dress shirt. While struggling to get the top button done against her fat neck, she realizes she doesn&#39;t have the faintest idea how to tie a bow tie. &quot;Crap!&quot; She says in her nasal male voice and she quickly picks up her phone to search for some instruction videos. Luckily after a few failed attempts she actually manages to get the thing tied properly, and hurriedly finishes dressing up by putting on her new brown men&#39;s shoes and blue suspenders. She then sits down at the vanity again to check herself out. She adjusts her blue bow tie a bit better as tears begin flowing down her freckled face. &quot;I love you Joe. I love you.&quot; She says while taking in the image of the boy she&#39;s made herself into. She notices the framed photo of her real self on the table in front of the mirror. She&#39;s smiling proud and seductively in that photo, and looks very sexy and feminine in a tight halter top and bold red painted lips. She picks up the framed picture with trembling thick hands and stares at it for a moment while crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Anna suddenly says, trying to stop her tears. She slams the photo down on the table flat so that it can&#39;t be seen anymore. &quot;No. Enough crying. You&#39;re a boy now Anna. A boy. Man up. Boys don&#39;t cry!&quot; She wipes her face clean of the tears and she... no HE takes HIS new glasses and puts them on. No more she&#39;s. No more pretty blonde Anna. He&#39;s Owen now! He looks at himself in the mirror once more and tries to look confident. &quot;Joe wants me like this. He doesn&#39;t want Anna, he wants Owen. So fuck Anna, who cares? She&#39;s got to go. I&#39;m not Anna, not anymore, I&#39;m Owen. I want to be Owen. I want Joe to like me!&quot;</p>
