<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Take it easy buddy, trust me, you're gonna like this.&quot;  The huge hairy biker says in his deep bass.  <br />
<br />
He grunts as he takes pleasure in you.  You look at him; he's about 6'6&quot;, full thick black beard with silver shot through it, the hair on his chest, arms and back is thick and black and also peppered with silver.  Underneath his pelt, he's incredibly muscular.  He's extremely masculine and you wonder why such a man would be fucking other men.<br />
<br />
He growls out as his thrusts become more urgent and powerful, &quot;Look at it this way, you and I will always be together after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare into his steel blue eyes in the mirror, he smiles back at you.  &quot;You hate me now, but trust me, we're gonna become best buddies and you're gonna love how I take care of you.  I'm gonna protect you as if my life depended on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rubs your back, massaging you as he fucks you.  Your ass has grown used to it's intruder and the constant rubbing of his thick seven inch cock against your prostate feels really good.  You want to come, but for some reason can't seem to.  This is not a problem for your assailant, within seconds he shoots six huge loads into you.  He roars out his orgasm, filling you with his hot biker seed.  He pushes into you deep and collapses on top of you, breathing heavily.  <br />
<br />
He growls in your ear, &quot;That was fuckin' good... real fuckin' good!&quot;  He pants for a bit and then says, &quot;Now it's time to make my little buddy feel good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stands back up and you realize suddenly that, you're now joined to him at the balls.  You panic as you realize that your sack and his have merged, his balls have merged with yours and his penis is now permanently fused inside of your rectum.  <br />
<br />
You start to panic and the biker says, &quot;Shhhhh…easy now… I told you, I'm gonna take care of you.  You and I are gonna become the best of buddies.  I'm going to be real good to you.&quot;  He pulls off your T-shirt and begins rubbing your hairy chest and your sides.  Your/his balls feel like they could go another round.  He says calming and soothing things, telling you just how big your are, how wonderful it's gonna be to be part of him and for some reason, this calms you.  He rubs your sides and then puts your arms to your sides and hugs you.  He kisses your neck and rubs your face, petting you from nose, down your chin and neck to your chest.  This sends a thrill through your body and his and you want him to do it more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name stud?&quot;  The biker growls, hugging you, caressing your neck, chest and belly, rubbing your arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Charley.&quot;  You say and you close your eyes in pleasure as the biker's hands run all over your naked torso.  He tweaks your nipples and you moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Chuck, my name's Gus; Augustus, actually but my bro's call me Gus or Bear.&quot;  He says, &quot;I like fine cigars, JD and I like especially strokin and fuckin'.  Don't matter to me who I'm fuckin'.  Men, women, as long as they'll fit I'm happy and now you're gonna share in my happiness, a happiness I've enjoyed since I started growin' hair under my arms and around my cock.  See Chuck, you're gonna be happy and a very important part of me, you're gonna be my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
You open your eyes and look in the mirror, the horror of what Gus had just said brought you back to reality.  You look and see that you are a good way through your transformation into Gus' new tool.  You try to move your arms and realize they've fused to the side of your body, you look down in horror to see that your legs are severely atrophied and are pulling into your body.  You're quickly becoming merely a torso.  You scream and Gus begins rubbing your/his balls and stroking your neck, shushing you calming you.  Your screams die down and your panic subsides as he soothes you.<br />
<br />
You watch in the mirror as your body begins to diminish, your neck thickening and shortening, the excess skin stretching into what you know will eventually be foreskin.  The hair on your head falls out as do your teeth.  You spit them out.  You look in the mirror to see that your legs have completely disappeared, the pants, shoes and briefs you were wearing are pooled at Gus' feet.  You are growing thinner.  Some of the hair on your chest has fallen out but you notice that the trail from your sternum to your cock… wait, your cock has disappeared too, pulled into your body.  You panic again and Gus rubs you and you are overcome by extreme pleasure and you can tell Gus is too.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it buddy, relax.  It's not gonna be bad, trust me.  I'm absorbing your muscle, my bones are becoming thicker as I take your mass into me.  You're adding about a hundred and fifty pounds to me, it's why I'm wearing such loose clothing and no shirt, I'm growing.&quot;  You look and see that, though Gus has probably only gained three or so inches in height, he's become extremely muscular.  He's built like a fireplug, wider than he was, thicker.  He continues to explain the process.  &quot;Your liver, kidneys and other organs are adding to the mass of my own.  Your lungs, of course are just going to disappear, but you won't need them.  You, are gonna be my pride and joy.  You're gonna be my fifteen inch, thick as ten year old's arm thick cock and don't worry about loosing yourself, you're thoughts are being transferred into my brain.  Soon you'll be looking outta my eyes.  Your knowledge and experience will be mine and you will be living in my body.  We've become one, Chuck, already you can feel me and I can feel you.  I bet you even know how this was possible, the potion I bought from that Comanche Shaman for a bigger dick.  Just look at how proud you're gonna make us, Chuck.&quot;  You look in the mirror again.<br />
<br />
You are a three foot long cylinder of pink flesh about as thick as a man's leg.  Your ears are holes in your head with no external fleshy ears.  Your head has changed shape, it looks flattened around the jawline and pointed towards the top.  You realize suddenly that you haven't been breathing for several minutes and you cannot now speak or scream as you no longer have lungs, you start to panic and you hear a voice in your mind, it's Gus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I have access to your higher brain functions, now we can communicate.  Really handy since you can't speak anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot;  You say looking as you nose and mouth merge.  &quot;And what's happening to my mouth and nose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;  Gus says in your/his mind, &quot;Because you came here to this secluded rest stop, because you're a small guy that I could easily absorb and because the Shaman's potion was going to run out if I didn't take you.  It's nothing personal Chuck, you were available.  And look at it this way, together we're gonna fuck a lot of pussy and ass, probably more guy's hairy asses now that you're part of me simply because most women don't like fifteen inch monsters like you up in them, but lots of guys do... even some of my bros.&quot;  Gus pets your head and you feel good all over.  &quot;Look at it this way, you're gonna live out all those bad boy biker fantasies you've had since you were old enough to want a Hawg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you…&quot;  You begin and Gus interrupts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Full access, buddy, your thoughts are mine and mine are yours.  You know now that if I hadn't put my dick in you and shot before the potion had stopped working that my dick would have shrunk to only an inch long.  You also know this is a one shot deal, I couldn't drink another potion, it would kill me.  You also know that I couldn't have lived with a nub of a cock and would have driven off a cliff drunk on my Hawg.  But just look at us in the mirror, buddy, you're almost finished.  We are gonna have a great time together, bro'!&quot;  <br />
<br />
You look, for the last time through your own eyes.  You are almost completely Gus' cock… you're cock, now.  Your mouth/nose has migrated to near the top of your fleshy head.  Your eyes have receded and seconds later are gone.  You look through steel blue eyes in the ruggedly handsome hairy face of a biker who is pumping a huge cock you now refer to as 'Big Chuck'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Chuck, you fuckin' horny bastard, let's fire off a load together!&quot;  Gus/you growl.  That load you've wanted to shoot since Gus pumped his into you comes boiling out of your balls, up what used to be your intestines, stomach, esophagus and out the piss slit that used to be your mouth.  The two of you moan in Gus' deep bass as shot after shot coat the mirror.  Finally, come drizzles out of Chuck's piss slit and is rubbed up and down the length of the hairy shaft.  The foreskin covers the new cock-head and Gus/you put 'Big Chuck' away in your jeans.  The clothing Gus/you wear is tight on you and shows off your extremely hairy, muscular torso, Gus/you examine how Big Chuck bulges out the front and you both smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;See buddy, I told you you'd like it.&quot;  Gus says out loud.  And you answer back in your mind, &quot;You're right, I do.  What are we gonna do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gus answers back in you mind, &quot;We're gonna go fuck a buddy of mine and maybe we'll tell him where he can get a bigger dick too, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan bro', let's roll!&quot; you answer back aloud.  &quot;I need a stogie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gus or as your Bro's mostly call you, 'Bear', pulls one out of his vest, lights up and goes back to the parking lot to hop on his scoot.<br />
You/he revel in the pungent flavor of the fine cigar as you strap on your helmet and fire up the monster.  The pleasant vibrations feel good against your now larger balls, Big Chuck comes to full attention and you pet him, &quot;Soon, bro soon.  We'll be fuckin' in about an hour.  Snake loves big cock up his ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
You roar off onto the highway, puffing on your cigar and enjoying the cool night air on your face.</p>
