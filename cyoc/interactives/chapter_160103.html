<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Cindy..” I said with a gasp, feeling myself divided. One arm wrapped around her and pulled her close, and I gave her a fleeting kiss, relishing the sensation of the animal inside me pushing forward. At the same time, I was panicked, wanting to pull away from her, confused by this almost alien and overwhelming attraction to her.<br />
<br />
“Please, master..” Cindy begged, her voice carrying an air of desperation and longing. “I need this.  I need YOU.” She pressed tightly against me, her fingers stroking me. “Please..please knot me. CLAIM ME.”<br />
<br />
My dick was aching. My whole body was screaming for the release of the transformation and the second release that would occur when I came inside of Cindy. Her scent was intoxicating. I could smell her pussy, burning with lupine heat contained in a human shell.<br />
<br />
She dropped to her knees, staring up at me with a devoted gaze. My dick throbbed more as she licked her lips. “Please, master..” she said, her voice quivering with a combination of lust and adoration. “I give all of myself to you, both woman and beast. Now PLEASE..” she begged, before suddenly putting the tip of my dick in her mouth and letting out another moan as she slid all the way down my length, her tongue caressing every inch of my shaft. I let out a growl. The pop of tendons starting to lengthen in my legs and rustle of black fur growing on my thighs filled the air. She pulled her head off, staring up at me with a bit of an impish grin as my body trembled in the beginning moments of my transformation. “Rrravage me, masterrrr..” she said, her voice gaining the roughened, growling tone of her own emerging animal side.<br />
<br />
She turned away, pressing her head to the floor as she raised her hindquarters to me. My eyes focused immediately on her offered mound as the first auburn strands of fur blossomed around its edges. Instinct took over completely as her heated scent grew stronger, reaching my nostrils and demanding one thing and one thing only of me. With no pretense or foreplay, I slammed my cock into her, thrusting hard as my muscles grew. I let out a roar of dominance and overwhelmed sensation as my cock ballooned and locked me inside of her. I humped her hard and rough, my claws raking her back as I grabbed at her body for further leverage, raising welts along her warping form. She answered my lusty ferocity with a similar enthusiasm, thrusting back hard against me as we both gave into our primal natures. <br />
<br />
Our bodies swelled with muscle and grew covered in fur, hers red, mine black. Our bodies cracked and reshaped in an almost indescribable cacaphony of pleasure. Our shared howls of climax rattled the walls, and even once we&#39;d collapsed, we remained knotted for a couple of minutes before I could finally pull out of her. We panted as we nuzzled each other, sniffing and cleaning each other&#39;s fur, until the reversion happened and we were once again human-shaped.<br />
<br />
Cindy smiled at me as she gave me a deep kiss, tender and long. It was full of meaning and emotion far beyond that of a simple lover. “I..I needed that, master.” She stayed close against me, even after we had redressed, almost as if bound by an invisible tether to me. One of her hands always was touching me, rubbing my arm or my back. “Will you keep me?” she asked quietly.<br />
<br />
“Ex..excuse me?” I asked. “Of course I&#39;ll keep you. I&#39;m not going to kick you off of the property to die! Why in the world would I do that?” My mind insisted that she meant something else; it was confusing. Other parts of me seemed to be waking up, and almost split personality of sorts. The instincts of the wolf were like a second voice in my head. She meant something more. I could almost understand the whispers of instinct, but I couldn&#39;t hear them clearly. I rubbed my temples in irritation, then pounded a fist in frustration on the desk. <br />
<br />
“Damn it, what&#39;s wrong with me?” I grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Nothing, master..” she told me, reaching out to stroke my back once more. She put her lips to my ear, speaking softly. “You&#39;re just adjusting to your new condition. It will pass soon enough.” Her voice was soothing, as was the scent of her so close once more. Arousing, as well, yes. She was beauty and power personified. And she was MINE. I turned to face her and nestled my face into the hollow of her neck and collarbone. I deeply inhaled, and had the overwhelming urge to tell her so.<br />
<br />
“MINE,” I said, kissing her neck. I felt her heat up, and the blush of her skin. The fluttering energy of the wolf and woman seemingly in unison being embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said softly. I could hear the smile in her voice.<br />
<br />
“No one else&#39;s. MINE,” I said more insistently. I gripped her more firmly and inhaled her scent more.<br />
The attraction to her was overwhelming me. For the briefest second, I wondered if I was losing my mind, only to realize that no, I wasn&#39;t. This was all of me, the man and the beast, realizing exactly what I wanted. HER. I could hear her heart beating faster. I could feel it as it pulsed in her chest and she pressed against me now, wrapping her arms around me and embracing me tightly.<br />
<br />
I pulled away from her just slightly, looking her in the eyes. “You are no longer a maid,” I said. She looked at me in surprise, her hand covering her mouth. “You are no longer my servant.” Her eyes widened in a bit of shock. “You are no longer bound in obedience and submission to me.”<br />
<br />
“What are you saying?” she stammered. “Are you..are you saying..” <br />
<br />
The insistent whispers and pull of my awakening instincts were telling me things. Telling me what to say, giving words to what I was feeling. “I am yours.” I twisted in her grasp slightly, turning just enough and lifting my head to expose my throat to her. Making myself vulnerable to her. I suppose it would seem strange to anyone, hell, it would have seemed strange to me too, but this was hardly the most unexpected thing to happen to me in the past day. There was no reason to fight against them; I was a werewolf. This was natural. Perhaps sudden, yes..but natural, all the same.<br />
<br />
She let out a quivering whimper, then pressed her lips against my throat. Tender, fluttering kisses lightly brushed my skin as she pulled me against her. Her heart hammered against my chest as she softly punctuated each one with a simple “Mine.” After several, she laid a finger on my chin and turned my head back to face her, then pressed her forehead to mine and closed her eyes. A contented sigh exhaled from her lips, and she softly said a single word. “Forever.”<br />
<br />
“Forever,” I agreed.<br />
<br />
We finally managed to pull ourselves from each other&#39;s grasp, albeit reluctantly. Cindy&#39;s body language had changed almost immediately. It no longer carried that aura of mild submission mixed with that of a horny teenager.  She was comfortable, confident, and radiated the power of a she-wolf in her territory. Her mouth was upturned in a natural smile, and as I sat back down at the desk, she stood by my side, nuzzling me once more before sitting on the edge of the desk.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to wear that uniform any more, obviously,” I told her. “Since you&#39;re no longer a servant. You&#39;re the lady of the house.”<br />
<br />
She beamed at this. It might have been obvious this was the case, but she clearly enjoyed hearing it said. She smirked, playing with the fringe of her lingerie. “What if I like it though? Being sexy and arousing my mate?”<br />
<br />
Mate. The word was wonderful to hear. Despite the fact we&#39;d only met today, and the nature of our relationship was purely sexual until only a few minutes earlier, it felt perfect. My eyes gravitated to her crotch as she lifted the hem of her maid&#39;s skirt ever so slightly, giving me a peek at her exposed mound. I smiled, trying to bite back the arousal that threatened to obliterate every other thought from my mind. “I promise you that you can do that all on your own, but if you really enjoy the outfit, I&#39;m not going to stop you.”<br />
<br />
She giggled, clearly happy at the effect she could effortlessly have on me, as well as what had transpired between us. It was the comfortable laugh of a woman who had the weight of things lifted from her shoulders. “I can always save this for when we&#39;re alone,” she said, her eyes sparkling playfully.<br />
<br />
She paused, then her expression changed to one that was a bit more serious, her lips pursed a bit tightly. “Mark is..probably not going to be happy with this development.”<br />
<br />
“Why&#39;s that?” I asked.</p>
