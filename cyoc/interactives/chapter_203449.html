<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a mischievous smirk on his lips, Ty began to comprehend his phenomenal powers of change and their limitlessness in a slightly more cynical way. He had to start thinking differently about how he approached problems, he decided. Get more creative. Get more adventurous. He had, after all, reduced Eileen to a girl and altered – or perhaps more accurately nudged – her mind into a new mode of being.<br />
<br />
He had to try to a new experiment. Something more drastic. Something more crazy. He willed her back into her normal adult self.<br />
<br />
On the couch next to him, innocent Eileen suddenly jolted back into her adult mode of being and the clash between her young hormones and her adult personality began anew as she began to grow and mature. The process took only a few minutes this time as she rocketed back up to her original MILFy body. Startled, she stretched out on the couch as she regrew and took in several cool breaths as she reached her original 6’2” and well over 40 years of age.<br />
<br />
“Whoa...” she grabbed her head, leaning forward and trying to fight off a massive dizzy spell. “That felt so weird. I... I knew I was... I was young. But... I was... not myself. I was... little.” She winced in confusion, mind a little fractured with the memory, and shook her head suddenly. “No... no... that’s not right. I don’t know what happened.”<br />
<br />
Ty looked over at his adult crush and realized with amazement her rapid progression from kid to woman had left her a 40 year old virgin.<br />
<br />
“Eileen, are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm...” the woman fingered the shirt surrounding her and blinked. “Yes... I... I think so. I feel so strange, though. So... horny.”<br />
<br />
“You’re still a virgin,” Ty whispered. “How does that feel?”<br />
<br />
“N-No... no.” Eileen winced again, as if trying to solve a particularly hard problem in her head. “That doesn’t make sense. I remember Becca’s dad. My first love. B-But you... you took me already... you were my first... I’m... I’m... a virgin?”<br />
<br />
Eileen spread her legs and gaped at the clear pink hymen closing off the majority of her vaginal opening. This seemed to spook the woman and she went oddly pale. “No... my... my memories... they’re wrong...”<br />
<br />
Ty’s eyes widened. The first indications of his mental manipulation were clearly showing. He willed her to forget the regression, the sex, and indeed the last hour or so.<br />
<br />
The woman blinked her long curling lashes, confused, and looked around the room. “Hmm? When did we get here?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Ty played stupid, “What do you mean? Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“The bathroom... I was shrunk. Then you grew me. Why are we watching kid’s shows?”<br />
<br />
Ty giggled as he realized they were indeed on the station devoted to kid’s cartoons. Ty tried something else. He urged Eileen to grow dimmer. Less intelligent. He watched her bright inquisitive eyes actually lose their warmth and focus. She stared at the TV silently for a moment, blinking, and turned back to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” She asked. “What were we talking about?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, we were talking about being shrunk.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes!” Eileen smiled. “Oh, yeah, that was so neat! You made me little. Is that you call it? Being shrunk? I didn’t know that.”<br />
<br />
More, Ty urged. Dimmer. Less experienced. Less intelligent. Just less.<br />
<br />
Eileen’s mental capacity sharply fell. She shuddered as her brain dumped knowledge, wisdom, and experience away. Her vocabulary shrank. Her overall mind itself seemed to contract and lose capability. She slumped back against the couch, dimmer, and stared at the TV. She actually smiled and laughed, pointing at the cartoon they were watching.<br />
<br />
“The duck got his face shot! That’s funny!”<br />
<br />
“You mean his... beak?” Ty chanced, quite startled at the sudden shift.<br />
<br />
“What’s...” She seemed genuinely confused. “What’s his beak? What?”<br />
<br />
“Never mind.” Ty blinked, even more startled.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Ty.” Eileen nodded. She zoned right out and stared back at the TV with mindless stupor. The images were captivating her. The sharp movement. The colours.<br />
<br />
Ty stared in shock.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Eileen?” Ty said softly.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” The woman turned suddenly, hearing her name and breaking intense concentration with the TV. “What?”<br />
<br />
“C-Can we... we go to your room?”<br />
<br />
“Oh! I have a room?” She concentrated on the last word and her face screwed up. “Huh? What’s a room? What does that mean?”<br />
<br />
Ty blinked in further shock and disbelief. “Y-Yes... your... your bedroom. You know?”<br />
<br />
“No?” She raised an eyebrow. “What’s a bed-drume?” She clearly didn’t understand the word and slumped back into the couch cushion. “I don’t get it.” Her eyes glazed over as she stared back mindlessly at the TV, losing focus immediately.<br />
<br />
Ty stared in shock for a moment. Then an expression of mischievous evil took over.<br />
<br />
“Um, Eileen?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” She turned again, startled, eyes wide. “What?”<br />
<br />
Ty took her hand in his and stood up. The woman stared at her hand in his and then up at Ty in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Come with me?” He said, amused.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Eileen blinked. “Okay.”<br />
<br />
She slowly stood up, her balance clearly off, and shuffled off the couch with Ty holding her hand. He began to lead her up the kitchen, startled again as she had trouble navigating the steps up, almost tumbling over. He had to held her slowly take one step at a time. She seemed to think that was entirely normal.<br />
<br />
Ty lead her back to the bedroom and watched as Eileen stared around the room in a total lack of comprehension at what she was seeing. She wasn’t just stupid, Ty realized, she was drastically and fully unable to function now, unaware of her surroundings or what they even were. Jesus, he had dumbed her down into a pliable simpleton. She had no personality, no ability to converse, she barely had any interest in Ty, seemingly indifferent to absolutely everything.<br />
<br />
“What’s my name?” Ty blinked.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Eileen snapped to his gaze and rocked her head to the side. “You? Your name? What is your name?”<br />
<br />
“No, what IS it?” Ty said insistently, troubled.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” Eileen scrunched her nose and put a hand on her forehead, trying to think. “What is what?”<br />
<br />
“My name,” Ty whispered. “What is it? Your name is Eileen. What is my name?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh,” she laughed oddly, nervously. “I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
Ty grew horrifically sick from that and decided to bring her back. The woman staggered for a moment, leaning against the wall, and grabbed her head. Her brain returned to full capacity, her memories and her experienced and even basic words flooded back in.<br />
<br />
“W-What...” She said groggily, shaking a little. “Ty, honey, what did you do to me? I’m swimmy.”<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled and ran forward to hug her. “Uh, nothing to worry about. Just trying something that went wrong.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, heavens!” She blinked. “Am I all right?”<br />
<br />
“Um... you’re a virgin?”<br />
<br />
In shock, refreshed Eileen lifted the shirt again and stared at a virgin unspoiled pussy with sudden red faced shock.<br />
<br />
“Oh my! Did... did you want to deflower me? I can’t remember. It’s... hazy.”<br />
<br />
That was an interesting avenue. Ty urged Eileen to lose memory now. He wanted her to forget the whole morning.<br />
<br />
It came as a shock as Eileen suddenly screamed and covered her exposed bush, blushing terribly red and shaking a little.<br />
<br />
“T-Ty! My goodness, darling! What are you doing in my room? I-I’m not decent!”<br />
<br />
Ty giggled to himself and reversed it. Eileen suddenly stood up straight, confused, and looked down at herself in extreme perplexion. “Wait...” She blinked. “No, why should I be scared? We’ve got a good thing going here, what with your power and all.”<br />
<br />
Ty laughed to himself, which Eileen caught as she gave him a quizzical look.<br />
<br />
“My goodness, you’ve been doing something to me, haven’t you? Is that why I can’t remember?”</p>
