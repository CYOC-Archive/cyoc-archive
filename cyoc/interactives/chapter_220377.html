<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To increase his chances his clothes may shrink with him, right after he drank water from the small bowl, he scooped more water and splashed water all over them. (He wore a dark green sweater vest over a white shirt, oversized khakis, and brown shoes.) He began to think it was quite ridiculous, but he was in his backyard after all, so not much may see him making a fool of himself.<br />
<br />
Progressively, Harold began to feel lightheaded, and with a blurred sight. He thoughts the water may have been tainted by some contaminant, so he panicked a little just before he briefly fainted. Regaining consciousness, he stood up, but it was not that easy. The ground had many bumps and holes and the surrounding was grass so tall, reaching our 42 years old lean man’s middle pecs level. Doing a quick math, he realized he was around 10 inches tall because he always cut his grass at 7 inches, which has been done the day before. He had to be careful, as he walked to explore his giant backyard.<br />
<br />
He was very close to the fountain, he decided to have a little look at it from his new point of view. He suddenly remembered both bowls were out of his reach.  There was no rush at that point to grow back, so he explored a little further his new environment. On his way inside that huge field of high herbs, he found a dime on the ground.  Amused, he grabbed it as it was not so heavy after all. He carried it for a while until he arrived at his patio. Lucky him, there was a ramp to walk toward the slates. He installed it to help when he had to move the BBQ grill pool size.<br />
<br />
Dropping his dime, he was in the mood to have a run all around his patio. He did at least 3 laps before something interrupted him. Actually, it was not something, but someone. Harold has totally forgotten about Andy, a nice young teen boy, who comes every Saturday to clean the swimming pool, and do some gardening for good money and also because he was always allowed to use the pool as long it’s only him and not inviting any other guys to come over. The man is never minded because he was always away or working inside as the boy was outside. So when Andy opened the fence’s gate to access the backyard, he noticed something running all around the patio. He first thought it was an animal, so he was ready to shoo it out. Getting closer he got petrified when he realized it was not an animal at all. His second guess was it could be some kind of very fancy toy. But it was not, it was the nice man who hired him, Harold, actually.<br />
<br />
The shrunken man suddenly stopped running at the sight of the giant teen boy staring at him. He was definitively not prepare of being seen at that toy size. <br />
<br />
Squatting down, the boy talked to Harold<br />
<br />
(Andy) OH My Gosh, sir! Why are you so tiny? And why are you wet? Have you fallen in the swimming pool?<br />
<br />
Seating, legs crossed, Harold told Andy about the size fountain, why he wanted to try it, and why his soaked his clothes for them to shrink too. Yeah he wished to know how it could be to see the world from a tiny man’s perspective. Then Andy told him something that surprised him.<br />
<br />
(Andy)  Oh yeah, I have heard of those fountains that seem to appear randomly in many places so far. Some theorized it was some kind of wizards who made them appear to see what can happen, others there are mad scientists who did it, and there are always those who say it’s extraterrestrials who made those.<br />
<br />
(Harold) I’m not sure where they come from, but don’t you think it’s cool to be able to shrink or grow as giants? <br />
<br />
The tiny man began to be uncomfortably seated legs crossed on a hard slat, so he stood up. He noticed, as the boy has his thighs spread in his squatting position, the fabric of his blue shorts was compressing his genitals, revealing his testicles and penis outline in a way that left not much room for the imagination. Harold is not gay neither is Andy, but boys and men are all the same when it comes to curiosity watching other guys&#39; genitals to compare. <br />
<br />
(Harold) I bet you’d love to take me in your fist to experience how it feels to hold a toy-sized man, right?<br />
<br />
Andy smiled and reached down at Harold to nervously close his hand around his body. He was very gentle with the tiny 42 years old man as he was lifting him to his face level. For Harold, it was an intoxicating experience for been held like that. The giant hand was soft and warm. <br />
<br />
(Harold) What about you carry me inside, would you? <br />
<br />
The nice boy nodded and carried Harold inside using the patio door that was not locked. On his way, his heart began to beat way faster. He even blushed a little because holding a shrunken man in his fist like that gave him a huge erection, and it was so unsettling because he was not able to process why it had that effect on him. <br />
<br />
(Andy) About I put you on the lunch counter now Sir? Oh and what do you want to do with your soaked clothes? I bet it’s not very comfortable.<br />
<br />
The tiny man began to really enjoy being with that nice young giant he already know after all, so he felt very comfortable going further into a game he suggested to Andy.<br />
<br />
(Harold) I tell you what. Well, first, it’s true, my soaked clothes are very uncomfortable. So let&#39;s play a game. Let’s say I landed on a Land of Giants and you found me. You are some kind of sciences-addicted boy, and you want to examine me closer. So you remove my wet garments to give me a physical exam.<br />
<br />
Andy giggled and jumped up and down a few times. Closing his left fist around Harold’s body he stripped out the tiny dark green sweater vest.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Andy) What a nice specimen I got here, let’s undress you to see how your tiny body is!<br />
<br />
The boy was enjoying it a lot, and Harold played his role as a tiny victim.<br />
<br />
(Harold) No, please kid, let me go! I’m not a toy, I’m a human being, you have no right to keep me like that!<br />
<br />
Both had a little difficulty keeping their serious as they giggled a lot.  But the boy then pull off the tiny white shirt.  The lean man was not very muscular, but the boy, still holding his toy-sized man in his fist,  played with his tiny peck, abs, and navel. Harold loved it more than he thought he could. But he was not in charge anymore, he was that boy’s tiny living toy, well sort of. Flipping him upside down, he removed the tiny brown shoes. The man’s erection was very hard, but no way the boy could see it because of the oversized khaki trousers he wore. But it was not long before, being flipped back head up, the pants has been pulled down. Then the tiny underwear bulge was very visible.<br />
<br />
(Andy) Oh, I think your socks and underwear are soaked too<br />
<br />
Giggling, he poked the tiny man’s bulge with his fingertip before he pulled down the tiny underwear. The tiny penis bounced like a spring. Finally he removed both tiny socks.  Harold thought that the boy could have took more advantage over him, but nope, he just put the naked tiny man on a doily and asked: “Where is your dryer sir?”<br />
<br />
Tiny Harold told him it was behind two French doors in the corridor. So Andy picked up the wet clothes and carried them to the dryer.  He put them inside, added a dryer sheet, and turned on the machine before he went back to the lunch counter.<br />
<br />
The tiny naked man was comfortably laid, legs spread, on his doily when Andy came back. Seating on a stool bench, the boy smiled as he began to gently stroke every tiny limb with his fingertip. He also took a tiny arm between his thumb and index fingertip to feel the tiny muscles, he did that with both arms and legs.  His dick was still erect, he even let the teen boy play with his genitalia. He was so aroused that he could not restrain his ejaculation very long, which made the boy laugh very loud.<br />
<br />
Then, there was other plans...</p>
