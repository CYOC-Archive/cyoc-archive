<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few minutes later, after their heads had cleared a bit, Tim sat up again, still naked and sweaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark,&quot; she said. &quot;I think my head is starting to clear now.&quot; She stared down at her naked tits and fondled her nipples experimentally with her hands. Then, as if she had decided on something, she nodded her head and said, &quot;Right!&quot; She stood up suddenly, causing all of her rounder parts to jiggle and shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Mark as he sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I use your shower?&quot; she asked. &quot;Also, can I borrow some of your Mom's clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
Tim immediately walked towards the stairs and headed up them, breasts bouncing with each step. &quot;Thank you!&quot; he heard her call down to him just before he heard the bathroom door shut. A minute later, he could hear the water running.<br />
<br />
Mark stood up and looked around the room. On the floor was Tim's ripped and stretched out basketball uniform. The couch was wet with sweat and bodily fluids. Mark's own underwear was damp as well. Mark decided it would be best to try to clean up a bit as Tim showered.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, the front room was looking relatively normal, except for a persistent wet spot on the couch. Mark had Tim's old clothes bagged up and was sitting and waiting when he heard footsteps on the stairs. When Tim appeared, she was wearing a pair of grey sweat pants, which fit tightly over her round ass and hips, and a simple white T-shirt, which also clung to her tightly. It was clear that she hadn't been able to find a bra to fit her in Mark's Mom's clothes. Her nipples stood out noticeably. Without looking at Mark, she walked to the door and slipped on a pair of flip flop sandals, and then she started to open the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; said Mark. Tim didn't turn to look at him, but she stopped moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, but surprisingly coldly. Was she angry?<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; she said and took a good long pause to get her thoughts straight. &quot;Thank you for letting me in and for... the other thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stood up and approached her. She closed the door and turned to face him. She was blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;God!&quot; she said and rubbed her forehead in frustration. &quot;I'm still so weirded out by this mess. I'm sorry...&quot; She looked ready to cry as her hand dropped to her side. &quot;I'm sorry I had sex with you. Okay? I'm sorry. It was dumb and gross and I feel all weird about us now. I know that even if I can get myself turned back, things will never be normal for us again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim...&quot; Mark started, but he didn't know what to say next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, I'm going back to the park. I need to try to find a way to get myself back to normal. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do there. It will probably be dangerous if she even sees me there, but I just can't give up. I have to try to get turned back somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned and opened the door. &quot;Bye!&quot; she said as she shut the door behind her. After a moment's hesitation Mark rushed to the door and then out to the street to catch her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; he said as he caught up to her. &quot;I'm not letting you do this alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;It's too dangerous. Look what happened to me. I don't want you getting screwed over by that bitch like this,&quot; she said gesturing to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; said Mark. &quot;You're my bro. I know things are weird for us now, after... the thing, but I'm here for you no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim looked uncertain for a moment, then she smiled and hugged Mark close. He felt her tears drip on his cheek. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered to him. She stepped back and wiped the tears from her eyes. &quot;God, I'm such an emotional mess. I really really hope we can figure out a way to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll find some way,&quot; said Mark smiled at her reassuringly.<br />
<br />
As they walked on to the park, Mark tried to figure out what was making him follow Tim there. Was he helping out a friend? He would do a lot for Tim, but this was a bit extreme, to be honest. Was he actually feeling a bit more than friendship now for Tim? After what they had just shared, it would be hard not to have deeper feelings. And then, there was how she looked and acted. She was absolutely beautiful now, true, but she also had a new tenderness to her. She felt gentler, more warm, which only seemed more appealing when contrasted with how lost and worried she was underneath it all. It was hard not to feel for her. Mark just hoped he had made the right decision following her.<br />
<br />
When they reached the park, Tim said, &quot;follow me.&quot; The two of them snuck hunched-over through the bushes, trying their best to remain quiet and unseen. Mark's mind flashed back to their days as little kids, playing soldiers and spies in the woods. Soon, they reached some bushes with a view of the benches, and there she was, still sitting in the same place, hamster at her side. &quot;That's her,&quot; said Tim, pointing to the genie.<br />
<br />
Mark felt nervous looking at her. She was very tall, gigantic really, and really cute, all around pretty intimidating. The thought that she possessed the power to turn his friend into a woman was pretty frightening as well. He asked the inevitable question to Tim, &quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot;</p>
