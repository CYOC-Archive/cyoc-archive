<br />
Right after Thaddeus Banks stepped off the bus being called by one of the cheerleaders, the school’s rent-a-cop Officer Dowd stood up and addressed the team.<br />
<br />
“Alright, since we’re going to be here for a bit, I’m needing my smoke.” The cop pulled out a cigarette and his lighter, lighting it up inside the bus. Sitting at the front, the smoke he puffed out wafted over to the whole bus, and most hated the smell accumulating inside the enclosed space. <br />
<br />
“Oi, can you not smoke in a non-smoking area, which is to say, the bus?” One of the teens in the middle of the bus complained. “Go outside, man.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re gonna suffocate us inside here, and you’re already stinking it up in here, no need to have your breath smoking it up in here!” The complaint was backed up by more as Officer Dowd looked to them in disdain. He’s the authority here, why are they so unruly?<br />
<br />
“Boys, sit down and shut up. I need my smoke.” He didn’t care about the boys much, they disrespected him too many times just because he was rented by the school. As he took another puff and exhaled, one boy made a noise. “Oink.”<br />
<br />
“Who said that?” Dowd scanned the bus for the troublemaker, seeing none being obvious. But like a domino, the boys took the signal and began barking out raucously, “Oink oink!”<br />
<br />
The whole bus became filled with oinking noises as the whole team began mocking the resource officer.<br />
<br />
“Oink Oink you pig.” Christopher yelled harshly, a sneer plastered on his face. <br />
<br />
The Resource Officer couldn’t take the mockery anymore, shouting loudly. “Fine! Disrespectful brats.” Smushing the cig under his boots, he walked out into the pouring rain.<br />
<br />
One ran up and locked the doors, sighing at the clearing air as the AC worked. “Damn, it’s getting too cold in here.” Eric walked to the AC and turned up the heater, sitting at the driver’s seat.<br />
<br />
“Hey, is that a <b>fox</b>?” Seamus asked, seeing the glowing eyes inside the darkness of the forest. After a second of inspection, he shook his head. &quot;Damn, thought I could find one in State Park and get a picture or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the glass windows began fogging up, the whole bus got comfortable in homeostasis. Some went to sleep, taking their time to get some rest. <br />
<br />
Christopher heard some weird, soft grunts at the back of the bus where a lone guy had his face slightly aglow from his phone. He sighed, knowing who he was. “Harry, can you not fap now?” He stood up, walking to the back of the bus to confront a guy with black hair and brown eyes. He had a fit body that he could play on the team, but the guy needed more bulk. <br />
<br />
“What? I’m horny.” Harry replied at the collective groans of the ones awake. Chris placed his arm on the seat’s backrest, seeing the slow sensual strokes over the erect dick in Harry’s grip, a lesbian porno on mute playing on his phone. <br />
<br />
“What, you have bull balls or something?” Christopher smirked, “You’re weirdly the most impulse-driven team member we have, and we’re jocks!”<br />
<br />
“If I do, I’d be putting out a load equal to a <b>bull</b>.” Harry chuckled at the joke, “Load of bull, yeah.” He kept stroking sensually, with Christopher watching and staring for some reason. <br />
<br />
The heat gradually increased, and both of them became increasingly warm. <br />
<br />
Christopher sat beside Harry, enraptured by the stroking. Some rational part of him screamed at the weirdness, but his hands reached to Harry’s cock and helped give him a handjob. Harry’s sudden increase in moans and groans made the ones awake shift about, crossing their legs in a sudden increase in lust. <br />
<br />
Christopher wasn’t gay, well, not really. He was bi-curious. The cock he’s stroking seemed to get bigger, and it was alluring to him. He leaned down, and took the mast into his throat for a taste. He was awkward with it, but as Harry moaned with the blowjob, the people awake started to go along with it.<br />
<br />
The big, burly jock with a head full of white hair, giving a blowjob to someone smaller than him. It was a porno scene at the back as the bus was filled with audible moans. Eric looked back to see it, and turned to the front, rubbing his erection. Not only him but even Matthew and Seamus.<br />
<br />
James was weirded out by the sudden lustful acts at the back, and stood up. He turned to see his friends taking out their cocks to masturbate as the two at the back went with it. &quot;Hey, Leo! What&#39;s happening back there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Lionel! <b>Lion</b> - el! I don&#39;t know but this shit is hot as heck I wanna join in!&quot; One light-brown-haired nerd-jock shouts back. He was already stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
He was becoming hornier and wanted to join in when one ginger-haired skull suddenly stood up and smacked him in the teeth, stunned and falling back onto the hard windows. He blacked out.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<i>Now</i><br />
<br />
Officer Dowd rushes into the bus, seeing cum stained teenagers lying on their seats in postcoital bliss. The ones rushing outside had no idea what had happened. There were solo masturbators, and ones stuck inside another in gay sex, and a big pile of guys at the back covered in cum.<br />
<br />
An orgy had happened in here. There was only a fraction of the team that participated in it, but there was a lot. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck happened here!” He shouts with his gun in hand. “Get yourselves under control!”<br />
<br />
“Whu- what?” Harry jerks awake from it, feeling something stuck under his ass. Chris was still on his cock, and he quickly pulls the other guy off his rod in shock. “Holy fuck!”<br />
<br />
More of them starts to wake up and were looking around in confusion. They couldn’t believe that they had an orgy in here, and they could remember it all in a haze. <br />
<br />
Until someone screams. “AH! I have a wolf tail!”<br />
<br />
“Me too!”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit oh fuck!” <br />
<br />
Christopher stands up and turns around to find a big, fluffy, and white wolf tail wagging behind him happily. His emissions dripping from his softening cock. <br />
<br />
“Uh, what is this?” He asked dumbly while gripping the tail he now has, tugging and yipping from the sudden pain. “Ow!”<br />
<br />
“Get out of the bus, now!” Andrew shouts as he went onto the bus and saw the damage. Just like him, the ones in the bus now sport a real animal tail behind them. Werewolf tails of different shades and fur based on the hair they had. Seamus ran out of the bus on the first command, a rusty-red fox tail swishing behind him as he held up his pants. <br />
<br />
Matthew walks out in a panic too, a deer’s short tail sticking down under his legs as he joins the ones who were asleep outside. All of them had to hold up their pants as their tails prevented them from correctly pulling their pants up.<br />
<br />
Harry followed orders, a long bovine tail swishing behind him swatting at nothing. He ashamedly walks out to the sight of the cheerleaders and chaperones watching them walk out after having sex and suddenly growing tails.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Christopher walks down, the snow-white wolf tail tucked between his legs. He was ashamed of himself as he stood in front of the coach.<br />
<br />
“Now, tell me what happened?”</p>
