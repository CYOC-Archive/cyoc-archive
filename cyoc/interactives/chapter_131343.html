<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arthur and Kay... Kay and Arthur...<br />
<br />
This is all the merman can think of as the couple tries adjust to life in the tank. Or at least wants to think of. He should be thinking of a way to escape, but everytime he sees Kay, his merman instincts take over and he finds himself incredibly horny.  Ever since their first night as a couple, this instinct has grown from being able to be held back by his human morals to a unavoidable drive. He&#39;s tried to masturbating the feelings away to give her a break, but it&#39;s no use. He&#39;ll catch a glimpse of her large red-orange tail around the corner of a coral formation and instantly the merman has to mate. And initially, Kay was just as into it: who doesn&#39;t want to orgasm pinned down by a sexy merman? But as his human compassionate love making turned more rough, it started to scare her. His eyes seemed to gloss over and he woudn&#39;t even look at her when he came. And when he finished, Arthur would grunt, shake his head and swim away quickly before they could talk. Something seemed wrong with her new partner.<br />
<br />
So one morning before he could wake up, Kay swam up to one of the cameras underwater and tapped on the lense. After a few taps, the camera angled up and down, signaling that someone was there responding. Kay gestured her finger to the surface and the camera moved again, agreeing. Kay swam silently through the dark tank and resurfaced along the metal walkway of the tank. She really didn&#39;t want to be this close but she didn&#39;t want Arthur to wake up and grab her before she could talk to someone. She waited under the simulated night sky and look at the fake stars while she waited for someone to come out of the small door. Five minutes later, a small light above the doors kicks on and a young man in a lab coat and glasses walks out carrying a tablet. He seems very nervous about being out here. &quot;Um hello, subject 2. How can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Subject 2? Really ? I change genders and I don&#39;t even get to be Subject 1? Figures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um subject 2? How can I help you?&quot; The young man doesn&#39;t seem scared of Kay, but does seem very nervous about being out here. Kay picks up on this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don&#39;t worry about it. We renamed ourselves anyway. I&#39;m Kay and he&#39;s Arthur. Why are so nervous?&quot; She flashes him a smile but he doesn&#39;t react to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to talk about it but we were all kind of surprised you wanted to talk now. First of all, its 2 in the morning and Dr. Ferris isn&#39;t even here right now. And considering your last conversation with him, we thought you didn&#39;t want to. It&#39;s been two days since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well I have a problem. And I want some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it the food? We&#39;ve stocked your tank with fish found in the ecosystems where we found the specimans beached. We&#39;ve seen you eat them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kay thinks back to her first time getting hungry in the tank. It was after a fuck with Arthur and she watched him dash into a school of fish, catching some in his hands, and swimming away to eat them. She was hungry so she did as he did, managing to grab two. &quot;It&#39;s fine. It was a little weird getting used to it but thats not why I&#39;m here. It&#39;s about Arthur. He&#39;s changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You both have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s not what I meant. Hold on, give me a second. Stand back.&quot; Kay slips back into the dark water and jumps out, landing onto the platform. She splashes the young scientist a little bit. &quot;Sorry but I was getting kind of tired looking up at you.&quot; She swivels her body so her tail dangles over the side. &quot;Sit down science boy. I won&#39;t bite.&quot; He does but keeps a good ways away from her. Kay smiles and he smiles back. He feels he can trust her but professionalism is important. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Arthur? He seems to be very...enthusiastic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. He&#39;s changed. I was a guy once, I know what it feels like to be horny. But he&#39;s not just that. We haven&#39;t even had a regular conversation since after we talked to your boss out here because anytime he gets close to me, he just wants to fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd nods. &quot;Yes, I see her that you two have achieved nine successful mating since being in the tank. Are they not consensual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are: I can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s impossile to not be attracted to him. I mean you&#39;ve seen his body: he&#39;s perfect. At first we talked about doing this for us, so we could mate and raise a family despite our purpose here. He was so caring and gentle with me.&quot; Kay female mind drifts off for a moment remembering her knight in scaley armor soft touch. &quot;But then he started getting more aggressive, talking less, leaving as soon as he&#39;s finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he just wanted to achieve a mating, letting all the extra foreplay go to focus on the ejaculation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kay looks at him sideways. &quot;You&#39;re a pretty big nerd you know that?&quot; The nerd coughs and adjusts his glasses. &quot;And that&#39;s what I though of too at first but he started doing other things. He started catching fish with his teeth and he works out so much. You&#39;ve seen him lifting boulders and racing along the edge of the tank. When I try to slow him down to talk, he pins me to the floor or some rock and fucks me. What&#39;s wrong with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nerd man taps and scrolls through his tablet. &quot;Well I&#39;ve heard of this kind of behavior before. Many male mammals during the breeding season will get very aggressive as their bodies get flooded with extra testosterone to induce mating behaviors. And even though we have such little data on your species, I can make a guess. We have procured many cadavers but out of all of them, only one or two males. There are so few males in the wild that their instinct may be to breed on sight with any fertile mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you give me a partner through all this and he only wants to fuck me and leave. Great.&quot; Kay sadly looks down at her tail. Nerd man gets closer to her on the platform and tries to comfort her. &quot;Well it might not last forever. Many males stop displaying this behavior once the female&#39;s chemical scent changing to reflect a successful insemination.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In English please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you get pregnant, you&#39;ll get Arthur back.&quot; Kay smiles. &quot;So we get what we wanted and I get him back? Great!&quot; Kay&#39;s tail happily slaps the water as the scientist quietly laughs. &quot;You&#39;ve loosened up, Nerd Man.&quot; She slides closer to him on the ledge but he doesn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is not Nerd Man, its Eric. And I&#39;m happy for you.&quot; Kay starts to feel a strange stirring in her chest, causing her to breath harder. &quot;Kay are you all right?&quot; She flips her red hair over her shoulder, letting Eric fully see her large breasts as she takes quick breaths. His mouth drops and he loses grip on his tablet, forcing it to drop into the water. &quot;Shit! My tablet. Can you go get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kay starts to get an idea. &quot;Sure I can. But you&#39;re coming with me.&quot; Before Eric can get up, she grabs his arm and drags him into the water with her. He can&#39;t see in the dark water and he is barely holding his breath. Kay lets him go and Eric swims up to the surface. Some more scientists rush out onto the platform. &quot;Eric, what happened? Things were going so well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. She just grabbed me.&quot; He starts to swim over to his colleagues when someone brushes up against his leg. &quot;She&#39;s circling me.&quot; His coworkers grab a life preserver and try to toss it out to him. He gets withing a few inches of it before she grabs him by his belt and pulls herself up to him. &quot;Kay listen to me. You need to stop doing this. Let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Don&#39;t you like what you see? Of course you do, I can smell it.&quot; Eric stammers. &quot;Oh yes I can smell it. You like me. You like the way I look. You like this body.&quot; Kay grabs him by the dick through his jeans, pleasure shooting through his body. &quot;You really like this body. And I like you too.&quot; She starts nibbling on his neck as she pulls off his belt and lets it fall into the water. Eric tries to speak some reason. &quot;Kay, please, this is outrageous. We can&#39;t do this.&quot; She moves her kisses up to his jaw and cheeks while pressing her large breasts up against his lean body. He can feel her hard nipples pressing against him but he tries to ignore it and the five hundred other things she&#39;s doing to get him off. But the mermaid is too strong and she wants what she wants. Wrapping her arms around his neck and head, Kay moans into his ear &quot;Fuck me,&quot; before sticking her tongue down his throat and diving forwards into the water.<br />
<br />
Some of the panicking scientists try to grab flashlights to find him and other run back into the lab to search though the giant glass windows of the tank. As she pulls him down deeper and deeper into the dark abyss, Eric stops struggling. With their mouths interlocked, he is breathing perfectly for being groped by a mermaid. And by now she has him completely under her spell. His hands magnetically run over her body, gliding over her skin and scales. He has completely given in to the mermaid&#39;s powerful pheromones and is ready to go further. But just as he is about to position himself over her body, a loud noise starts to come from further in the tank. Like a torpedo, it is piercing through the water towards the soon-to-be lovers until it slows down to a halt, revealing himself to be Arthur. Arthur grabs the puny human by the shirt, grunts &quot;Mine&quot;, and throws Eric so high he breaks the surface of the water and goes airborne before landing on the platform next to his coworkers. They immediately give him a towel to cover himself as they usher him back inside the lab. As he walks away and the fog lifts, Eric can hear waves crashing against the surface as the two merpeople finish off what he started.</p>
