<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Krebs (who looked just like a 12 year old me now) and me and my Dad all went to the hardware store. Mr. Krebs told me what kind of chain I should get, and he told me we didn&#39;t need to move the car to put the chains around the tires. It was going to snow again in just a few days and I might be trapped in his apartment when I got there, so he told me I should go grocery shopping later when I could. <br />
<br />
It was exciting. I knew I should be frightened but I was super duper excited! I was going to DRIVE A CAR!! I wish Ryan was here to watch me. I am having way too much fun now being in Mr. Krebs huge and tall body. Even just walking around the hardware store, I notice I&#39;m the tallest guy in the store! Other grown ups all have to LOOK UP at ME! It&#39;s so cool! I love being tall! <br />
<br />
I bought the chains with MY new credit card. Mr. Krebs had given me the passcode before we left. It was his birthday, which is super easy to remember because it&#39;s also on MY driver&#39;s license. <br />
<br />
Dad talked to me about sports stuff and I listened and tried not to comment much. I just said I loved all the same teams he did while Mr. Krebs as me rolled his eyes in the back seat. <br />
<br />
Dad dropped us off and we were finally alone. He told the new Jake to have fun with Mr. Krebs and do everything he said. Luckily for me, Dad had to get back home so that he could start shoveling snow since it had piled up so much. He said it would probably take him the whole day and he made &quot;Jake&quot; promise to help him when he finished learning about cars from me. Ha! This was working like a charm! And it&#39;s even better now that I don&#39;t have to shovel snow! This whole body swap thing is getting better and better. And tonight I can use my big dick again to get hard and masturbate. I really like masturbating, I&#39;ve decided. It feels amazing! No wonder guys are always talking about sex! <br />
<br />
I looked at the car. MY car now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woooooooow,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s the first time anyone has said &quot;Wow&quot; to my Dodge Mirada,&quot; Mr. Krebs said, a bit depressed sounding. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s pretty cool,&quot; I said, and I meant it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. We don&#39;t have much time,&quot; Troy Krebs said, in my body. He made me sound so serious and grown up. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you have to loosen up if you&#39;re going to be me or Mom and Dad are going to notice. It&#39;s okay to smile once in a while.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just teach you to drive first. Okay, champ?&quot; the 12 year old replied. <br />
<br />
I learned that day how to put chains around the tires. You have to arrange them in a certain way, and then lock them together with these little snappy lock things. It&#39;s actually really smart how they&#39;re designed. I told Mr. Krebs I thought it was pretty cool and he said he was glad I thought so. <br />
<br />
Then the Big Moment came! <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You ready to get this show on the road, kiddo?&quot; the 12 year old asked me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you calling &#39;kiddo&#39;? My name is Troy. Troy Krebs and I&#39;m a totally awesome teacher and a really cool guy and I have an awesome student named Jake who is also super cool,&quot; I looked down on him and smiled. He handed me a pair of sunglasses for sun glare. Now it was all up to me. <br />
<br />
Seatbelt. Check. Brake. Check. Ignition! Check. Reverse! <br />
<br />
Luckily, the school parking lot was empty because I reversed too much and halted suddenly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. Just take it niiice and easy. Try it again. Put it into drive and then press the accelerator and turn left. Slowly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now steer right again and center the wheel.&quot; The car edged forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, I&#39;m driving!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are. Just be cool. Okay, we will do a couple of loops around the parking lot first for practice, okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; <br />
<br />
My voice sounded so cool. I was so ready for this! I turned right and did a complete loop and used the turn signal just like Mr. Krebs showed me. Even though no one was around. But you are always supposed to use it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you don&#39;t use it, it&#39;s because you&#39;re a fucking asshole, because only fucking assholes don&#39;t use their turn signals.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You probably shouldn&#39;t curse like that if Mom and Dad are around,&quot; I told him cautiously. <br />
<br />
Left turning was next. I did a whole loop around the parking lot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now you&#39;re going to turn onto the road and you are going to go up to 20 mph. Alright, buddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! This is awesome!&quot; I jumped up and down in my seat a little bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Concentrate on the road. Make sure you are always looking out for cars in your rearview mirror.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
He had me drive up to 30 mph and soon we were zooming down Main Street. I got to my first stop sign and stopped right as I should. I was learning how to accelerate and stop with Mr. Krebs help. I was getting the hang of this! It was really similar to riding a bicycle, only you had a lot more power to go way faster and you had to time things a bit better. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, bud. Let&#39;s get some lunch.&quot; <br />
<br />
We chose IHOP because IHOP has really good food. I parked for the first time and did everything to shut the car down. I smiled. &quot;I just drove us someplace!&quot; The waitress seated us and asked me if I wanted the smoking section and I said I wasn&#39;t allowed to smoke. When we took our seats at the booth, I told Troy &quot;Dad wants you to join a sports team. Or me. He wants me to join baseball or soccer or football.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;With this little tiny body I should concentrate on baseball or soccer. I&#39;d get creamed if I tried to do football like this.&quot; He sounded really bummed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry about all this,&quot; I said, &quot;But look on the bright side. You had like, a really hard childhood, right? I mean...you must have. Maybe you can have a lot of fun for once. I mean, you&#39;re super serious all the time and you were having fun with my Mom making gingerbread houses and cookies, right?&quot; I said, trying to be helpful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents are really wonderful people. I wish I&#39;d...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. I just...I hope you know. Like, if you want to come over to our house I can tell my parents, when we switch back. I was thinking, you could like, be like an uncle or something. If you want. My parents really like you. I mean they like me as you, which is confusing but they also like you as me, which is also confusing.&quot; We both started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see, what should we order?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you order something with sugar? Treat yourself,&quot; I told him. &quot;And I will have the um, chicken salad. That&#39;s okay, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Troy ordered waffles with fruit and syrup, eggs and sausage. I ordered a bacon and egg combo and the chicken salad. I paid for it with some of the cash in my wallet. I smiled. I had money! <br />
<br />
Mr. Krebs told me to go to his apartment first so he could show me around. I drove us there, and I was very proud that I did everything correctly. I stopped at all the red lights on time and I didn&#39;t crash into anyone. I was very good with braking. I parked and we went up to his apartment. It was not that big but Mr. Krebs lived alone. He showed me where everything was. Clothes. Dress clothes. Gym clothes. I saw an army uniform in his closet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! You were in the army??&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think I could afford to go to school?&quot; the 12 year old boy replied. &quot;Yeah, I was in the army. I miss it sometimes. Sometimes I miss it a lot, but it doesn&#39;t pay as well as a regular job and coaching can pay really well if you can make the big leagues. That&#39;s my dream, to coach college football some day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you like coaching junior high?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s just that I dedicated myself to a profession that I love and care about and a lot of students are just unmotivated. It&#39;s...that part is hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
I suddenly felt very guilty. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Krebs. Troy. I really think you&#39;re a great coach, honest.&quot; I did something I didn&#39;t expect. I picked him up off the ground and gave him a great huge hug. He wrapped his legs around me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I am huge,&quot; he said after our hug. I really am. I mean, just staring at your face, at my face...I am in awe. You&#39;re so powerful. So much more than me. He stared into my eyes for a while and I felt my big dick getting hard. I put him down gently and a little awkwardly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. You said you wanted to show me how to do some more of those exercises.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We have to do this quickly. You still have to drive me back to your parent&#39;s house.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Right. Of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
He showed me a few back exercises and I could feel how big my back really was! He had really big dumbbells. Not like my dad. He had up to 75 pound dumbbells but he told me to use those only for chest and leg exercises. He also gave me notes on how to do exercises at the gym. He had written them out on notebook paper in very neat writing. I had a whole schedule for the entire week, 5 days a week of weight training and cardio and on the 6th day I was supposed to go running as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really work hard, Mr, Krebs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, kid.&quot; I smiled again because it was so funny now when he called me that...<br />
<br />
&quot;I should call you kid from now on!&quot; I said. &quot;Okay, kiddo? Let&#39;s get going with these weights, kid!&quot; <br />
<br />
I had to take him back home. I drove past parks and the school and all the stores. I was a grown up now. Just like dad and all the other dads who drove their sons around. That was my role now. I parked in front of the house. <br />
<br />
This would be my first time away from home except for two weeks of summer camp last year. I told Troy that. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to man up now, son. Much like I had to. It was different for me because I was young but I had to be really mature at a young age. I had a lot to deal with. My aunt couldn&#39;t do that much for me. I had to do the laundry and the cooking and all the chores on her farm. It was a tough life but I was determined to grow up to be a big man. I worked so hard on my muscles. Getting stronger and stronger. I wanted to prove to everyone how I was just as good as them if not better. Promise me you&#39;ll take good care of my body.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise. I will. Super duper swear,&quot; I said in my new gruff voice. It was still surprising to me how deep and cool my voice was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Try and call Dirksen again tonight. Try and get him to fix the machine. Maybe he can give it to you before you come over for Christmas. Your mother will be calling you. I gave her your number. Oh and I wrote it down for you as well as some important information. It&#39;s on your gym notes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. Thanks.&quot; <br />
<br />
He got out of the car and walked up the drive. Dad was still shoveling snow. I waved at him. He waved back. I felt a pang of sadness but also excitement. I was free to do whatever I wanted, with no one to tell me what to do. I had my very own apartment. It wasn&#39;t too big or too small. It was big enough for just me, and my new weight set. And all my cool new clothes. <br />
<br />
When I got home, to my new home, there was a note on the door. It was a Christmas card with two snuggling teddy bears and it read: <br />
<br />
&quot;We should get together again soon. Last week was a dream. You are such a hunk. XOXOXO,  Jayson&quot; <br />
<br />
Jayson? Who&#39;s Jayson? <br />
<br />
I walked inside my apartment. I was all alone now.<br />
<br />
I took a shower and wanted to rub my big dick but I didn&#39;t. I threw on some clothes and called Mr. Dirksen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake? Jake, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me! I mean, I&#39;m an adult now. I can drive now! I drove us around today and I&#39;m a really good driver!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...good to know. Look, Jake. I am so sorry. I really am. I have to tell you something. All the circuits are fried. It took me years to build my device. To start over from scratch, I would have to rebuild it and do it exactly the way I did before. It will take me years. I am so sorry. I will do everything I can to help you two. Anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
I felt numb. I felt a little overwhelmed. What were we going to do? For years? How was I going to be Troy Krebs? How was he going to be Jake Sherman? <br />
<br />
I sat down, a little dazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake? Are you there? Jake!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here. Look, I&#39;ve had a long couple of days. I&#39;m going over to see my parents again for Christmas and I&#39;ll see Mr. Krebs. I mean, myself. This is still pretty confusing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to have to get used to being the new you. Both of you are. I&#39;m really sorry. I feel so terrible. If there is anything I can do, I will. I&#39;ll help you out at school. You&#39;re going to have to be a gym coach now. I&#39;m sure Troy will help you adjust to that all he can and I will support you as much as I can. I know this isn&#39;t fair to you. To either of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m actually having a lot of fun right now. I can drive a car now! How many 12 year olds get to drive around all day long, huh? And I&#39;ve been learning how to um...exercise and make sure my muscles are gonna stay big so Mr. Krebs doesn&#39;t get mad. I mean, some day I have to give this body back, right?&quot; There was silence at the other end. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m not sure. I actually don&#39;t know for sure if I can repeat what I did before. I have all my notes but it&#39;s very exact work. I&#39;ll definitely try.&quot; <br />
<br />
I closed my eyes. &quot;So what you are telling me is that I am stuck like this for how long?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;At least three years most likely, if not longer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go.&quot; I hung up on him. I couldn&#39;t talk about it anymore. <br />
<br />
I looked at the weights. I needed to work out. And I did. I worked out hard using my new dumbbells. I started thinking of everything as mine. My apartment. My wallet. My bed. My dick. I got super pumped. My arms and chest were glistening with sweat. Outside the wind was howling. I was a musclestud now. I took some time to flex in the mirror. God, I was so big and handsome and strong now! I noticed my hair was slightly receding away from my temple, which means I would probably go bald some day. I wondered how I would look in a few years. My face was seriously like something out of an action movie with Arnold or Stallone. I looked like I could be a good guy or a bad guy. With big muscles like this, I could probably get a job as a model. People taking my photo all day. I smiled.<br />
<br />
Could I be in this adult body for three years? I mean, if I have to, I have to. I can still see my parents, but they just won&#39;t know it&#39;s me. I started to cry, even though men aren&#39;t supposed to do that. Grown up men aren&#39;t supposed to cry. <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. I wiped my tears. I had to be a man now. I had to man up. Troy told me that I had to man up. <br />
<br />
At the door was a handsome blond stranger with a beard only a few weeks old. His hair glistened gold and his mustache and goatee glimmered just like his blue eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi. It&#39;s me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jayson?&quot; He closed the door. He was so beautiful it overpowered me. I thought that only girls could be beautiful. But I&#39;d been thinking about what Mr. Krebs said about how men could have sex with women OR men. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry I haven&#39;t called. I&#39;ve been just so stressed out since I lost my job and Christmas is like in a week. Have you been crying? Oh no. Sweetheart!&quot; He touched my cheek. I told him the truth. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking about my parents.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie. It&#39;s okay. Come here.&quot; He was much shorter than me, so I was a full head taller than him. He guided my head down so he could kiss me. <br />
<br />
He kissed me and he tasted so good. <br />
<br />
Sparks flew all over my mind. My big muscle body heaved as we fell onto the couch together. We were all over each other. I couldn&#39;t control it. I knew I wanted to have sex with him. I had never wanted anything more. He was so HOT! <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the bedroom.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
We kissed and kissed for what felt like hours. My body was so much bigger than his. I dwarfed him and it felt good to be so much bigger than regular sized men. My pants were still on but he was taking them off, unzipping my jeans and cupping my massive package. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, it&#39;s like a cucumber. I need it. I need it so bad. Fuck me, please.&quot; I grinded my big dick against my underwear and began dry humping him. I didn&#39;t have a word for it then. I actually learned the word for it later. I gently removed my underwear and then realized my jeans were still on. I hopped off the bed trying to take them off, and he removed his clothes until he was fully naked. He was so beautiful. My cucumber sized dick throbbed in mid-air. I numbly walked back to the bed and started kissing him gently. Then firmly. My tongue was a lot bigger than his so I shoved it far into his mouth. Now. How do I actually have sex? <br />
<br />
And then I knew. I instinctively grabbed his legs. They were so much thinner than mine. My cucumber touched his asshole. I needed to fuck. I was a man now. I had needs. I wasn&#39;t some kid anymore. I needed to FUCK! I was on my knees on the bed and shoving myself inside him. My dick was so big that I could only get it in a few inches. He was moaning and whimpering. I shoved it in further. It was awkward because I&#39;d never done this before. He started helping by moving his ass over my dick back and forth slightly. I figured out that I could pull out as he pulled away and then we could rock toward each other and he&#39;d moan as I did it. I could tell that he really liked it. And then before I knew it, I was cumming inside him, and I couldn&#39;t stop. I started powerfully thrusting my big dick inside him very quickly. BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! His legs were slapping against my crotch. I was a man. I was a powerful man and I was attracted to men and women and I needed to FUCK. I needed to FUCK!!! I thought of the cheerleaders and the football studs and I thought of them fucking each other, both the football studs with each other and the football studs fucking cheerleaders. I used my powerful arms to drag him into me as I thrust and came during one long ejaculation. <br />
<br />
My cum leaked out of his hole and onto the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are the hottest man on the fucking planet,&quot; he whispered. I scooped up the cum that fell out of his ass and tasted it. It was instinctual. I needed to do it. &quot;Please let me taste it,&quot; he pleaded, so I shoved my fingers into his mouth so he could taste the sperm that I&#39;d flooded his ass with. I did it again, squeezing his asshole so that I could collect my cum and I fed him with it from my hands. He licked up every drop. <br />
<br />
I suddenly remembered what Mr. Krebs had said about wearing a condom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I didn&#39;t wear a condom. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. We both got tested. It&#39;s fine. You haven&#39;t been with anyone else, have you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;An entire family.&quot; I told him about getting snowed in and having to spend time with Jake&#39;s family. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; I didn&#39;t have an answer and then I did. Mr. Krebs is gay and has sex with another man. He didn&#39;t want anyone to know. He doesn&#39;t want anyone to know. Lots of people don&#39;t like gay guys. He didn&#39;t want to tell me. He couldn&#39;t call Jayson as me, as Jake. He couldn&#39;t tell me because he didn&#39;t want me to know he&#39;s gay.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I was with Jake&#39;s family and...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t need to explain.&quot; He rubbed my shoulders. He was so serious, just like Troy. Like me, I supposed. <br />
<br />
Everything had changed all at once. I had been thrust into adulthood and there was no going back. I was a man now. I spent the rest of the night fucking Jayson more in different positions. I had never done anything like this and now I couldn&#39;t stop. I loved the feeling of my huge dick going inside him. When I was a boy, I couldn&#39;t imagine how it would feel to have sex and now I was like a locomotive, powerful like Superman and I even looked a bit like Superman, only with a face where my eyes made me look very dangerous. A tough guy. I spooned with Jayson and we snuggled under the covers. I kissed him and played with him and overpowered him. <br />
<br />
If I was stuck like this, I might as well just live my life and enjoy it. I thought as I fell asleep that I was actually okay with it. Mr. Krebs didn&#39;t have a family and now he would. Now he&#39;d would have a family, my family. He would get to be a kid and have fun. He would get to have a mom and dad. And I was suddenly happy for him. I knew I could be a part of the family as well, only I would be someone coming into the family. <br />
<br />
And I still had to break the news to him. I thought about what to say to him. I drifted off to sleep.</p>
