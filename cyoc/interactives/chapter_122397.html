Jeff stood over Andrew as he turned off the water pressure valve, his tail wagging happily behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Andrew.  I don&#39;t know what I would have done without you,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
And he meant it.  His stubby hooved fingers never would have been able to manipulate the small metal valve.  That was part of why he decided to ask Andrew for help. Well, that and the fact he had set the Chronivac to alter reality to accommodate his new appearance.  As far as anyone knew, he had always looked like this, so Andrew would not have been shocked by his appearance.  Nor the fact that he was nude. Well, nude for a cow.  He was still covered by a nice coat of black and white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.  That&#39;s what friends are for, &quot; said Andrew, wiping some water off his hands and onto a towel.  &quot;I am still a little confused about why you thought you could sit on something so small in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I am just not used to my weight, &quot; said Jeff, blushing a little.  &quot;I have put on more than few more pounds recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I think you look great, very healthy. You need to keep up your weight to maximize your milk output. Speaking of which, &quot; said Andrew, holding up a metal pail. &quot;Are we gonna do this or what?  You must be bursting at the seams to call me so urgently.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a mixture of anxiety and excitement.  This was why he had called Andrew, to help milk him.  But now that he was here, in person and standing in front of him, Jeff felt a little embarrassed. Was he really going to let his friend milk him? Andrew made the decision for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, no need to be shy, &quot; said Andrew, grabbing Jeff by a teat and leading him to the living room.  &quot;It&#39;s not like this is the first time we have done this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jeff sat down on the couch in front of Andrew, he realized it was the first time for him.  He felt a little vulnerable as Andrew pulled up a small stool and sat in front of him. He felt a bit silly - he was easily a head taller than Andrew and must have outweighed him by a large margin.  But he still felt defenseless as the small man sitting in front of him slapped some oil on his hands and began rubbing them together.<br />
<br />
Jeff was about to ask Andrew to be gentle when he suddenly reached forward and unceremoniously grabbed a nipple in each hand.   Andrew began to tug and squeeze quickly and methodically, in an almost mechanical fashion.  It hurt a little at first.  Not because it was painful per se, but because the teats of his udder were so sensitive.  It was like the entire surface of each nipple was lined with multiple tingling nerves.  Each squeeze by Andrew sent shocks up to his brain, a little painful at first, then gradually more pleasurable. <br />
<br />
And then the milk started to flow.<br />
<br />
It was pure bliss.  Each squirt felt like an ejaculation from his penis, a never ending stream of orgasms.  Jeff leaned back and spread his arms across the couch, gripping the cushions tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  Just... don&#39;t stop!&quot; said Jeff breathlessly.<br />
<br />
Andrew shrugged his shoulders and continued, much to Jeff&#39;s delight.  He could have stayed on that couch forever.  But the pressure in his udder gradually ebbed and flow of milk slowed to a trickle.  Andrew finally stopped, wiping some moisture from his brow.  He had worked up quite a sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you still have some milk left, but I think that&#39;s all I can do for you here.  I don&#39;t know why you just don&#39;t come down to the farm.  We have machines that can do a much better job than me.  They wouldn&#39;t be so rough and they could empty out a lot more milk,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes lit up. There was a milking machine?  He imagined himself hooked up to it for hours, no all day, in an almost constant state of euphoria.  He was tempted - but he was also a little worried.  He had swapped a little more than he intended with the cow. Hell, he wasn&#39;t even sure exactly what he had swapped.  He thought perhaps it might be better to make a few adjustments with the Chronivac before he went anywhere.  He could always go over to Andrew&#39;s family farm later.  Then again, maybe he should ask Andrew to stay.  He didn&#39;t have much success using the Chronivac with his hooved hands.  He might need Andrew&#39;s help to get back to normal.  Well, relative normalcy.  But did he really trust Andrew enough to let him use the Chronivac?<br />
<br />
Andrew poured Jeff&#39;s milk into a large metal container and capped it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me know if you ever need help again.  We could always use the money.  Do you have any idea what this stuff is going for on the open market?&quot; said Andrew, patting the milk can.  He blushed a little. &quot;Well, I guess you would know.  It is how you make a living, after all.  But my family really appreciates your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew turned and headed for the door.  Jeff hopped up off the couch and stomped over to the door, gently grabbing Andrew&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I have another favor to ask,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Andrew shrugged.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, anything, just ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &quot; began Jeff. &quot;I was wondering.....&quot;</p>
