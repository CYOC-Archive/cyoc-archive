<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ryan came over, Kat could see that he had one thing on his mind and that it was sex. Even a blind person would have seen that, what with the lust in his voice. Ryan was good-looking, true, but that was all. He had the attention-span of a six-year-old and unless anything was related to sex, it held none of the little he had that could be counted as attention. He would jack off to a keyhole if he found it attractive enough. He had was mean and he and his friends only got away with their bullying because they were good at football. It was the sole reason they could go into college. Everyone agreed. Even them, but they thought it as normal. Ryan especially. He thought everything was due to him because he was good-looking. All the girls wanted to be with him solely for that and it made him cocky to the extreme. As if he needed it. Because of his skills in football, all teachers except the coaches wanted to flunk him and get him expelled. With his buddies, Ryan just threw salacious comments to girls, joked about those they found unattractive and watched videos of animals mating and of people having intercourse. Well, all that was about to change.<br />
Kat introduced Ryan into the empty home and offered a drink or snack, but Ryan asked it they could see her room. Of course. Kat was one of the only attractive girls he had not had sex with and dumped the morning after so he was excited at the idea of adding her to his wall of fame. Good. Kat counted on that, precisely. She had put on a sexy blouse and mini-skirt and with her high-heels, he could not stop staring at her. He was almost drooling. So she led him to her bedroom and they made out on the bed, Kat saying she had always found him irresistible and his muscles incredible but that she was too shy to ask him out, considering how popular he was, especially with other girls. This made his ego increase like crazy, so much that he was too stupid to realise it was all just lies. She removed her skirt, heels and panties and he ogled at it, already touching himself under his jeans.<br />
&quot;Oh, you like what you see?&quot; she asked with a stupid little giggle.<br />
&quot;Yeah... You&#39;re so hot...&quot; he answered, already panting.<br />
&quot;You... You want it? Really? You&#39;re not just saying...?&quot; Kat said in a shy little voice, of course completely faked.  <br />
&quot;I really want it,&quot; he said, touching her vagina with crude feeling and palpating gestures. &quot;I want your sweet pussy.&quot;<br />
Kat winced at his disgusting gestures but he didn’t even notice. He was too ruled by his libido. Anyway, she had him just where she wanted him.<br />
&quot;Have at it, then!&quot; she exclaimed, saying out her spell.<br />
A second later, the bed only contained Ryan&#39;s clothes. He was gone. She had turned Ryan into her vaginas, only he could still speak in a tiny voice. But not for long. She had other plans. Fun plans.<br />
<br />
Ryan had trouble understanding where he was. He had been enjoying himself, masturbating while he was going to bag that chick he couldn&#39;t get his hands on before, to then brag about it to his pals, but now he was... somewhere. He felt completely different. He could see. But he could not feel his arms or legs. He felt as if he&#39;d been squeezed into a ball of warm fabric, like... flesh. Into a fleshy ball. And he had... hair. As if he&#39;d grown a beard. And he was between two pillars of a pink sort of stone. More like flesh, too. And the world was out of proportion. Bigger. And... And why did he see the bed he was on, now enormous, with his clothes, also gigantic, and now empty? What was going on?<br />
&quot;Help! What&#39;s happening?&quot; he shouted.<br />
And why was his voice tiny?<br />
&quot;Well, you told me you wanted a little pussy, so I thought you&#39;d like being one!&quot; laughed a feminine voice above him, louder than usual but one he&#39;d heard recently before. <br />
&quot;What? Kat! What happened? Help!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a witch, you see. And I&#39;ve turned you into my vagina! You found it nice and everyone knows you love vaginas so much, I thought being one would please you!&quot; she laughed.<br />
She turned to a full-length mirror and indeed Ryan could see himself there, with pubic hair and a clitoris and labia and the whole thing.<br />
&quot;No! Turn me back! Please!&quot;<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; Kat pouted playfully. &quot;Now you can be what you love! I&#39;ll remove your voice and shave you, finger you and later you can feel penises go past your new lips and into your new mouth! Won&#39;t that be great? You can feel panties every day and taste the blood of my menses every month. Except when I&#39;m pregnant. You&#39;ll feel a baby growing next to you and feel its head and body pushing through you and stretching you to the fullest to come into the world! And the rest of the time, you&#39;ll have the fishy smell of my cum and acrid smell of mu urine to keep you company. You can be full of female cum non-stop now! And I have not mentioned my anus yet. But I&#39;ll reward you with some lesbian sex. You can kiss and touch and rub and feel another vagina! Won&#39;t that be exciting for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Please! Not that!&quot; begged Ryan.<br />
What she mentioned had to be a nightmare! A nightmare come true! The simple notion of feeling the giant penises of other men thrusting into his new anatomy like that... No! And the rest sounded just as bad! The smell and taste of blood every month... With as only relied a kid developing behind him, readying itself to tear him apart mine months later... Ugggh! Revolting! <br />
&quot;Please! Don&#39;t! I&#39;ll do anything!&quot; he exclaimed in horror. <br />
Kat did not listen to him. She grabbed a feather from under her bed and gently touched her vagina with it, then more forcefully. The tickling got Ryan to let out peals of laughter and more pleads to stop. He giggled and it even brought a few twitches and light spasms thanks to his new nerves being solicited. He couldn’t scratch himself and he could only giggle helplessly. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t like that, ;little pussy?&quot; innocently asked Kat.<br />
&quot;No! ...Stop!... Please... I&#39;d rather be anything else....&quot; Ryan begged between uncontrollable laughs.<br />
Again, Kat had Ryan exactly where she wanted him. It was almost too easy.<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; said Kat saucily. &quot;You wish is my command! Nothing&#39;s too good for my darling little pussy!&quot;<br />
And with another spell, Ryan was gone.<br />
<br />
Ryan knew immediately that something was not right. Again, he could not feel his limbs and he felt imprisoned inside a fleshy encasing. Again. Except this one was more stretchy. Relatively speaking. Also, it was dark and moist. Warm, though. It felt he was in a fleshy prison within a fleshy encasing. Ugggh! Not again! And he could not talk. This was worse! Where was he? He could not move, could not speak and je could not see anything.  Where had this witch sent him now? He had no idea. It wasn&#39;t like before whee he could see where he was. At best, it showed he wasn&#39;t the silent (or not. Which was worse?) penis of one of his pals or the anus of a faggot or something disgusting like that. Then, to his (brief) relief, he heard Kat&#39;s voice, as if she was right next to him.<br />
&quot;Hey, Ryan, how are you feeling? You aren&#39;t my vagina anymore. You&#39;re just an occupant of it. You are now an ovum of mine. An egg, if you prefer. You&#39;ll stay there, safe and sound, until a sperm arrives, fuses with you and once fertilized, you&#39;ll develop into a brand-new baby. What do you say?&quot;<br />
Say? Ryan could not talk but he was fuming inside! He was an egg, ready to be fertilized? He would be a kid and would have to grow up again? It was barely better than before! No! He wanted his old body back, period!<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t get my period again until you are born so you&#39;ll stay safe. Also, and that&#39;s the fun part, once I have sex with your future father, I can select the precise sperm to enter you! You can be reborn as a girly girl or as one of the people you loved to torment so much! The perfect punishment! And once you&#39;re born, I can also give you to a couple who&#39;d be delighted to have you. Like a same-sex couple. You know, those other people you love so much! As soon as you&#39;re fertilized, you&#39;ll regress to your ovum state and lose your memories. In the meantime, you can fall into a deep sleep and just awake once in a while to go back into your hibernation-like state. Are you happier, now?&quot;<br />
Ryan knew she herself knew the answer. He was mortified. He could be reborn as anything human! Even a girl! Oh no! That witch could choose everything for him and he had the distinct feeling it would not suit his present tastes... As he slipped into a sleep-like trance, just as she predicted, he regretted being so mean to others, now that he had high chances of becoming one of those people. His worries did overrule his contrition rapidly, though, before he lost all sense of time.</p>
