<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas thought he was arriving on the set for the first shoot of the film but wondered why <br />
there was no makeup and wardrobe yet. The set seemed right, a big sciency looking <br />
laboratory. But the people also didn't seem right. First, there weren't enough. Thomas <br />
didn't see any of the actors that he knew would be making the film with him and he only <br />
saw a handful of the cast and crew, primarily the producer and a few of his assistants.<br />
<br />
The film was going to be based on the Incredible Shrinking Man but the writer's had <br />
already taken many liberties to rewrite the story. The main character would not be married <br />
but would have a girlfriend. He would be a bit of a loner so that when he started shrinking, <br />
he wouldn't have so many caring people looking out for him. The main character would <br />
have to face his shrinking issues on his own and have to watch out more for the neighbors <br />
and others who knew him but weren't so fond of him.<br />
<br />
The producer came up to Thomas, &quot;I'm glad you're punctual. I understand that you're just <br />
getting started in the business and it's good for your reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;I've done several movies now. I'm no rookie.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;I do research on all my promising hopefuls. I know about all the <br />
movies you've done. You show promise but really, you've only had bit parts and most of <br />
the movies you've done were flops. In fact, the only movie you did where you appeared for <br />
more than five minutes of screen time wound up never being released into theaters. But <br />
don't worry, this movie will make you famous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas asked, &quot;So where's the wardrobe so I can get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;We're doing things a little different here due to a discovery I made <br />
while traveling in Asia. This will give you a chance to do some research for the role so you <br />
can make a better performance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;I don't understand. I've been doing research. I've watched every shrinking <br />
movie I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;You'll find out. anyway, this first scene is a nude scene anyway so <br />
there's no wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas was still confused but knew enough to expect nudity. Although there was very <br />
little nudity in previous films, he knew that the writers had to go to great lengths to explain <br />
where the smaller clothes came from and in some cases, the writers had gotten lazy and <br />
allowed the clothes to shrink with the person. But really, that doesn't make logical sense. If <br />
a person is going to shrink, either he's going to be in some enclosure that shrinks <br />
everything inside including clothes or only his body will shrink leaving him naked. You <br />
can't have a guy take a pill, be hit by a ray gun, or be exposed to a mysterious fog and <br />
have him and his clothes shrink but nothing else. So Thomas got undressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A full nude scene?&quot; Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
The producer answered, &quot;Yes. Now step over to that mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see any large props.&quot; Thomas said.<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;I'm sure you've read the script and know that the shrinking occurs <br />
gradually. The scene we'll be doing today is from when you first start to shrink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;I don't recall nudity at that point in the script. It makes more sense to just <br />
have over-sized clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;We're still making slight changes to the script as we go along. This is <br />
the scene where the scientist friend helps to discover why you're shrinking. So we decided <br />
it makes sense for him to give you a physical and just to give the audience some eye <br />
candy, why not a naked physical. We'll give the audience a side shot so they don't see <br />
anything but they'll know you're naked. Would you be okay getting a prostate exam on <br />
camera. That will really get you noticed in the movie industry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas just glared at the producer.<br />
<br />
Just then, something poked Thomas and he jumped, &quot;Hey, what was that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer answered, &quot;That was what I discovered in Asia. You are now going to get <br />
some research for the role. You are going to shrink and I have complete control of your <br />
size. I can make you be five feet tall for those scenes in the movie or I can make you 1 inch <br />
tall for the other scenes in the movie. This will save money on sets and special effects. <br />
Let's start with six inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas felt a rush go through his body and he shrank quickly. He screamed as he lost an <br />
inch per second. After about a minute, he was only six inches tall and looking up at the <br />
producer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer bent down and looked at Thomas. Thomas was aware that the producer's <br />
face was larger than Tom's whole body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Tom Thumb, I shrunk you. I think I'll keep right on calling you Tom Thumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
The producer quickly scooped Thomas up in his hand and stood up. The producer placed <br />
Thomas on the counter. Thomas was dizzy but unhurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is scary. Change me back. I don't feel safe.&quot; Thomas said.<br />
<br />
The producer said, &quot;Well, remember how I said this would be good research for the role. <br />
Remember that in this movie, the main character has to face this horror by himself with the <br />
people around him being neutral at best and hostile at worst.&quot; The producer gently <br />
grabbed Tom's little hands and lifted them up over his head so that Tom was stretched <br />
out. &quot;What better way to understand the role than to experience the life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;You're not going to hurt me, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Thomas.&quot; the producer said, &quot;Don't worry. I truly intend to make this movie and so I <br />
need to keep you safe.&quot; The producer lifted Tom up by his hands and lowered him into a <br />
nearby jar. The jar was skinny and just the right size that Tom couldn't do anything but <br />
stand inside the jar as the producer fastened the lid on the jar. &quot;You'll be safe in there and <br />
I can keep an eye on you while we make this movie. This will be your home for a year. I'll <br />
let you out during filming and also, who says we can't have a little fun. Several of my <br />
friends can't wait to measure your body and see just how small you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas asked, &quot;Can I get some clothes at least?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; the producer asked, &quot;Much of the fun will be seeing you standing naked beside <br />
things that are bigger than you.&quot;</p>
