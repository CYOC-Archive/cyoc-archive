<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah and Sidney gave a polite farewell to Miles after their portion of the interview and began to make their way home. It wasn&#39;t a bad home, by any means, but it was something that was calm and quaint and where Noah had lived a fairly quiet life. With degrees in theater and electronics, he&#39;d long set up a career testing and streaming games on YouTube. The games didn&#39;t matter, as it would range from things like World of Warships or Tanks on PC to even Mario on a gaming console. At first it was only with hired testing for various gaming companies, which worked, but at one point one of the company representatives tried to throw a bit of a wrench into the works by engaging Noah in a bit of joking during the game, which Noah eventually bested by playing the role of a character that had endured similar tests from his theater classes.<br />
<br />
The company man actually found it interesting and offered that Noah could probably make more money taking that &quot;character&quot; into entertainment with regard to the gaming industry and it wouldn&#39;t affect testing games. Noah would have obvious rules to follow regarding what information to release and when regarding that testing, but with games that were out there for the public already, the character he created in that test might actually work well. From there, Noah then got started and he had fun, and those that lived near him soon heard stories on the character he played while gaming and made for some fun when he wasn&#39;t at home, though it wasn&#39;t something that many in the area saw as a romantic attraction, which ultimately left Noah with Sidney for company. Though, Noah never minded that.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d picked up Sydny from a local shelter when she was a young kitten and had found her largely black body with a white muzzle and socks to be quite cute. He&#39;d been tempted to name her Tux at first under the assumption that she was actually male. When the shelter staff told him that Sydny was in fact female, he decided to go with Sydny, a name that could go for either gender. And from there, he let Sydny have the run of his home, and she even made a few appearances on his streams where he&#39;d be playing a console game, only to have Sydny come and sit in his lap while he was playing and meow to him. He found it cute and adorable, and comments on YouTube soon urged that Sydny play a role because of her interactions with him, and Noah couldn&#39;t say no. He&#39;d come to love her too much.<br />
<br />
And that love carried over after she became an Animalian and converted him shortly after. Noah had never thought the shelter cat he&#39;d picked up would love him so much in return, but as he looked over to the uplifted Cat Animalian and saw her smile to him, he couldn&#39;t think or imagine anything else and found that despite her being diagnosed with Feline Leukemia, the end consequences, he thought, proved to be the best thing that ever happened to him.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The small zoo facility that Ben and Tyree ran was fairly familiar to Noah, and there had been a few times that he&#39;d even visited it, often for a break from other things. And the two Thylacine Animalians were fairly friendly and often hands on with a fair amount of the work that went along with running the zoo, but it was the fact that they were Animalians that brought Noah to the zoo today with a sick and lethargic Sydny laying in the plastic carrier under his arm. She&#39;d been having some worrying signs, that started with a decline in her coat quality and other symptoms soon after. At first, Noah had felt that it was just some mild cold-like thing, and that Sydny would be fine, however, it persisted and some of the other symptoms were worse, including Sydny having a seizure-like event. After that, he&#39;d taken her to the vet, and found that it was Feline Leukemia.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Noah,&quot; Tyree stated as she looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Noah answered, &quot;I was told your veterinary staff has some contacts with Horizon... and could... help Sydny.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then lifted up the pet carrier and let Tyree look in through the wires that marked the front of the cage to see an underweight Sydny on her side. His nerves and worries were running at full bore, because Sydny had become so important to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, she&#39;s gotten Feline Leukemia from somewhere... and it&#39;s bad... my normal vet thinks it&#39;s progressing enough to kill her,&quot; Noah spoke, &quot;and... please. I can&#39;t live without her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t she have been vaccinated for it?&quot; Tyree asked as she was joined by Ben and the two of them began to lead Noah from the entry gates toward the veterinary offices for their zoo.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s generally been an indoor cat and I&#39;ve done my best to keep it clean,&quot; Noah answered, &quot;so, I&#39;d never felt the need for it. Though... about a week or so ago, she managed to get out... somehow. She came back, and I&#39;d found that she&#39;d gotten into a fight with a stray cat, and one that had had Feline Leukemia and the vets had been something that then gave Sydny Feline Leukemia and made her sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uplifting should be able to cure that, but you might still want to get her vaccinated for things like Feline Leukemia,&quot; Ben commented.<br />
<br />
Noah nodded and then lifted the pet carrier up and then spoke into the carrier, &quot;you hear that, Sydny, they said this will cure you and you&#39;ll be okay. Just hold on... please... hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
They eventually made their way to the veterinary office at the zoo, which had had some areas adapted to allow for conversions and potential uplifting in the area when needed. Noah paid little attention to the decor and simply followed Ben and Tyree. The veterinary staff was kind, but ultimately insisted on taking Sydny into the conversion room privately.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s very important!&quot; Noah protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; the vet spoke as he took the cage from Noah, &quot;but the uplifting process can be confusing for newly uplifted Animalians, and that could risk them either spreading their condition as Animalians in the process... and given your cat&#39;s present health condition being related to being ill, it could result in you not only becoming a Cat Animalian but also catching Feline Leukemia yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can set out here and wait...&quot; Tyree offered and then handed Noah some sheets of paper, &quot;and review over the conversion forms. Given reports and records... it is not uncommon for uplifted pets to either form familial or romantic attachments to their owners. Sydny may want you as her mate once she&#39;s an Animalian...&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah paused and looked at himself. He wasn&#39;t exactly overweight, but neither was he exactly in peak physical health. He&#39;d always been somewhere in the middle. Though he knew that Animalians almost always seemed to be in peak physical condition, and he could see that in Ben. Even with clothes on, the male Thylacine Animalian was fairly well muscled and toned. To a degree, Noah was a bit jealous of Animalians for the builds they had, even if he&#39;d never thought of becoming one before. In fact, he wouldn&#39;t have wanted to uplift Sydny because a part of him figured that once she became an Animalian, she&#39;d lose interest in being with him and would go out into the world and explore and he&#39;d wanted to love her as long as he could. She was friendly, marked him as hers by rubbing against his legs while cooking, and would sit and watch him game without causing any trouble and a couple of times, he&#39;d wake up in the morning to find her asleep on his chest and purring as she slept. He only brought her in for conversion now because he thought she was on death&#39;s door. The prospect of her being interested in him romantically never occurred to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll fill it out,&quot; Noah spoke, &quot;I&#39;ve lived with Sydny long enough to know her behaviors... if she does want me around... I&#39;ll gladly change for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah then sat down and began filling out the paperwork provided. It was a fairly standard form, though deep enough that he never noticed the vet coming back out and shutting the door. He heard the door click into a locked position, which would keep Sydny in the room, but Noah paid no attention to that. He merely focused on the work expected of him with his mind and heart racing, hoping that Sydny would be okay. Just as he finished, he heard a knock at that door and then a female voice coming through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; came the voice, Sydny&#39;s voice, &quot;is anyone there? Is Noah still there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sydny?!&quot; Noah spoke as he stood up, though the veterinarian beat him too the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Miss Sydny, I&#39;m,&quot; the veterinarian began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not talking to you right now,&quot; Sydny cut him off, &quot;I want to talk to Noah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah chuckled and presented the veterinarian with the filled out paperwork. The vet looked at it and nodded while pressing the button that controlled the lock to the door and then stepped back. Noah then carefully opened it and stepped through. He found Sydny standing there on the floor, totally naked and only in her fur. Other than the pink skin on her nose and her semi-erect nipples, and the soft skin that made up her vagina, her fur was the same color as before and regained a lot of its luster. The black looked brighter and not as dull as it had become before. The white fur was crisp and formed solid gloves on her hands and socks on her digitigrade feet. It then highlighted her generous bosom and her wide hips quite well. She also looked like she&#39;d regained the weight she&#39;d lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, Sydny,&quot; Noah spoke as he looked to her and saw her muzzle pull into a smile at seeing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love me,&quot; Sydny said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so,&quot; Noah spoke, &quot;and why I brought you here after you got sick... I... I didn&#39;t want you to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sydny gently put her hands on Noah&#39;s shoulders and slowly pulled him toward her, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to die either... because... well... this will sound very un-cat-like, but it was because I love you too. And... I... I think always felt that way, but just couldn&#39;t understand it. Now... for some strange reason, I do. It&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably the result of you now being an Animalian,&quot; Noah told her, &quot;a race of anthropomorphic Animals that have been around for about six years now, almost seven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Sydny mused and nuzzled her head to Noah&#39;s, &quot;and would they have anything against me loving you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they would have rules... edicts... about us breeding if I were to stay Human, as we&#39;d be different species,&quot; Noah commented, &quot;but because you&#39;ve just been uplifted, the Animalia Virus in your system is still active and contagious. You could turn me into an Animalian... and then we could be together in every way. Though... we&#39;d then need to get all the vaccinations in. The Animalia Virus, Rabies, Feline Distemper, and Feline Leukemia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Sydny nuzzled Noah more, &quot;well, I&#39;d accept that... if you&#39;re there with me. For I know you love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Noah hugged Sydny while feeling his penis grow erect in his pants as he felt her breasts compress against his chest, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you Sydny... I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do I change you?&quot; Sydny asked, &quot;the vet gave me a shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could start with a kiss...&quot; Noah spoke with a smile kissed the front of her muzzle and it wasn&#39;t long before Sydny&#39;s mouth open and Noah felt her rough tongue rubbing against his tongue and it wasn&#39;t before more things began to change... Namely a bit of a warm itchy feeling as fur started to grow out over is body. His clothing made that itchiness worse, but he soon felt Sydny&#39;s hands began to drift down and was undoing his pants&#39; button, and he realized kissing probably wasn&#39;t going to be the only thing they would be doing soon, and he moved Sydny toward the examination bed as his ears began to move to the top his head and becoming triangular in the process.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The transformation was unforgettable for Noah. Black and white fur coming in, though for him, it was in a somewhat different pattern than Sydny&#39;s. He not only had a white muzzle, but also a small white spot above each eye. He also had a white neck and chest with the exception of a black mark that almost looked like a bowtie. The white fur also continued down his chest. He also had the white gloves, but not the white socks that Sydny had. The last of his fur that was white was the very tip of his tail, the rest of his fur was black. But becoming an Animalian wasn&#39;t the biggest thing for Noah, the biggest thing was gaining the loving mate that he had in Sydny. And maybe one day, they&#39;d have kittens, as the two of them had now expanded how his gaming and streaming actions did, with even improved &quot;characters&quot; with Sydny doing it in a full ball gown that covered everything in order to make sure that nothing was going to be attempted at selling &quot;sex,&quot; which the gaming industry frowned on.</p>
