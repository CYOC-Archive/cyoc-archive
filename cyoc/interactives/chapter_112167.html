<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
John quickly tamed his growing erection.  The fear and anxiety of getting caught quickly ruined the mood and doused any excitement he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, I know you are in there.  Just open the door.  I am not going away, &quot; said a voice John didn&#39;t recognize.<br />
<br />
He looked at the clock.  It was eight o&#39;clock at night on a Saturday.  He didn&#39;t remember any plans with his friends.  Who in the hell would be bothering him at this time of night?  Probably a salesman or some religious nut trying to save his soul.  With an angry grunt he threw open the door, intending to give them a piece of his mind and get rid of them quickly so he could get back to his fun.<br />
<br />
John was surprised to see a pair of breasts directing in front of his face.  He looked up and saw that they belonged to a very tall girl.  She was dressed in a black shirt and matching skirt with gothic flair.  Short black hair outlined her large round face, highlighted by a small silver nose ring.  John had no idea who this girl was.  He was suddenly felt very self-conscious, aware that he was practically nude, wearing only the special trunks provided with his pill.<br />
<br />
The girl looked down at him with a sneer and sighed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents told me you were a runt,&quot; she said dismissively, as she pushed past the shocked John into his apartment.<br />
<br />
John was too stunned to stop her.  Sure, John was a little below average height.  5&#39;7&quot;, maybe 5&#39;8&quot; on a good day.  But he was no runt.  This girl was just big.  She must have been over six feet tall.  He guessed from her perspective everyone must seem like a runt. But although she was tall, she did have a good figure.  She wasn&#39;t rail thin like most tall girls.  She had some curves, but he wouldn&#39;t consider her overweight.  Not at her height.  Yes, she had a nice hourglass figure with a plump ass that reminded him of Marilyn Monroe or maybe even Anna Nicole Smith.  Yeah, she would be quite attractive if she got rid of all that goth stuff. <br />
<br />
John felt his erection begin to grow again, along with the rest of his body.  He quickly redirected his gaze and tried to think of something else.  He didn&#39;t want to change in front of some stranger, especially when he wasn&#39;t sure if he could control himself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Got anything to drink?&quot; asked the girl, as she bent down and peeked into his fridge.<br />
<br />
John was no longer excited, but he felt his blood begin to boil.  Who did this girl think she was?  Barging in his apartment and now stealing his food and drink?<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, but who the hell are you?  I think you need to leave right now before I call the police!&quot; said John angrily.<br />
<br />
The girl turned around holding one of his expensive imported beers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This all you got?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
John just glared at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it&#39;ll have to do, &quot; she said with a shrug as she popped the top and took a big swig of the beer. &quot;I&#39;m Dana.  Your date for tonight.  Remember... our parents set it up a couple weeks ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
John had almost forgotten.  He was getting older and his parents were pressuring him to get married.  He had reluctantly agreed to let them set him up with their friends&#39; daughter just to get them off his back.  But this is who they thought would be a good match for him? That was ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Dana could read the expression on his face. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m not happy about it either.  You&#39;re really not my type.  I usually go for the bigger guys.  Or at least normal size guys.  But my parents threatened to cut me off if I didn&#39;t do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then leave, &quot; said John angrily.  &quot;Look, this really isn&#39;t a good time for me. &quot;<br />
<br />
Dana plopped down on his couch and shook her head.  &quot;No way!  I have to stay here - at least for a few hours - or my parent&#39;s won&#39;t be satisfied. And I really need their money. I&#39;m afraid you are stuck with me.  At least for tonight. &quot;<br />
<br />
John was furious.  He didn&#39;t want to deal with this tonight.  He stood in front of the couch angrily glaring down at her.  He was about to let loose with a tirade when he noticed something.<br />
<br />
Dana was sitting on the couch, her legs spread wide in a very unladylike fashion.  Didn&#39;t that girl have any manners?  But that wasn&#39;t what attracted his attention.  No, what stopped his coherent thoughts was the fact that she wasn&#39;t wearing any panties.  He could see her bare groin.  It was neatly trimmed with a small tuft of black pubic hair. <br />
<br />
Guess the carpet matches the drapes, he thought idly.<br />
<br />
He continued to stare at her groin, enthralled by the sight of her pussy.  He had never seen one so large.  No wonder she liked larger guys.  But after he changed it would be no problem for him.  In fact, it might be too small for his monster package.  The thought of taming this wild shrew kind of turned him on.  He imagined himself pounding into her, making her beg for more.  As he continued to fantasize his member began to enlarge and engorge, beginning the transformation of his body.<br />
<br />
Dana looked up at him crudely ogling her groin.  She quickly closed her legs and pulled down her skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t get any ideas.  I just forgot to do my laundry.  That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m open for business, especially for a shrimp like you ......&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana stopped as she stared at the bulge forming in his shorts.  Dana liked big guys, and she had trained herself to spot large packages hidden in pants and shorts.  And judging by the bulge forming in this guy&#39;s trunks he must be huge.  Monstrous even.  Maybe the biggest she had ever seen.  She had to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  Never mind!  Let&#39;s get a look at what you are packing,&quot; said Dana, as she put her hands on his hips and pulled John towards her.<br />
<br />
The motion quickly pulled John out of his trance.  He realized what was happening and quickly fought to control himself.  But not before Dana teased open his trunks and got a glance at the monster.  She frowned as it shriveled down to its normal flaccid state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  What the fuck!&quot; she said with shock.  &quot;I&#39;ve heard of showers and growers, but that is fucking ridiculous.  I have never seen one go from so big to so small.  Are you a mutant or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
John backed away.  &quot;Okay, I have had enough.  I want you to leave.  Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana pouted.  &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be that way.  I was just having some fun. It&#39;s not like I was gonna rape you or anything.  I just wanted to see what you had.  And now you got me curious.  Just how big do you get?&quot; asked Dana with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s none of your business.  And you aren&#39;t going to find out.  Now leave!&quot; said John nervously. A small part of him was eager to show her.  Wanted to impress her and give her the fuck of her life.  And that part of him was getting stronger.  He wasn&#39;t sure how much longer he could fight it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you are about that?&quot; asked Dana, spreading her legs wide and showing everything.  She leaned down and tugged on the neckline of her shirt, revealing full breasts and pert nipples. &quot;We don&#39;t have to fuck.  I mean, we do have a few hours to kill.  We could just play a game of &#39;you show me yours, I show you mine&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
John bit his lip tightly drawing blood, fighting the urges building within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; he said with a shaky voice.  &quot;I just want you to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; said Dana as she stood with a huff.  She bent down to look in his eyes and ran a finger up his chin.  &quot;But you don&#39;t know what you are missing. &quot;<br />
<br />
The sensation of her touch and the scent of her body so close proved too much and John&#39;s body suddenly grew in a quick burst.  The top of his growing head smacked Dana in the face, giving her a bloody nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, you don&#39;t have to headbutt me!  I can take a hint!&quot; she said angrily.  She glared down at him.  But something seemed off.  She didn&#39;t have to look down so far.  It almost seemed like he was taller.  Like his whole body was bigger.<br />
<br />
John&#39;s fear and anxiety of being discovered quickly killed his erection.  He slowly began to dwindle down to his normal size.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It was an accident.  Just go.  Please, &quot; pleaded John. He had succeeded once again, but he didn&#39;t know if he could stop it again.  He could feel the need building back up already.  Maybe the pill was going to be more of a problem than he thought.  <br />
<br />
Dana continued to watch him.  Something was off about this kid.  And she was determined to find out what.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure.  Let me just get cleaned up in the bathroom and I&#39;ll be on my way, &quot; said Dana slyly.  Before John could protest she was off to his bathroom, only hesitating slightly to assess the damage to his door.<br />
<br />
Now alone, John fought to control his urges.  Part of him desperately wanted to have sex with this girl.  She was willing and very attractive.  But he couldn&#39;t risk revealing his secret.  Then she might blackmail him or something.  Force him to be her sex slave, or just turn him over to the authorities. Or maybe to some doctors.  That&#39;s just what he wanted.  To be stuck as a lab rat for the rest of his life.  He felt his body swell and contract as his fear and lust fought for dominance over his body.<br />
<br />
Then a sudden realization allowed his fear to win out.  He had left the pill bottle in the bathroom.  A bathroom now occupied by Dana.</p>
