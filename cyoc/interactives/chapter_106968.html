<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby&#39;s farm was in a bit of a turmoil, considering that most of the livestock there has been exposed to something in the water that caused them to transform into muscular humanoid versions of themselves. Maintaining order among these beast men who had suddenly been gifted with sapience was not easy. The uplifted cattle in particular, far larger and stronger than any of the other animals, were being very antsy about their new status and where they were going to live. Fortunately, Robby the fox and Clara the cougar were able to keep the uplifted animals from going amuck by explaining the Ten Edicts of Animalia, which appealed to the livestock even if they were a bit leery of the two predators.<br />
<br />
However, Abby&#39;s biggest concern was not about the transformed livestock, but about herself. An hour ago, she had gone riding on the farm&#39;s stallion, Samson, through the woods. Sam had drank from the stream which had the same thing that was in the farm water that caused the animals to change. Sam accidentally spread the change to Abby which had a rather big effect on her. Now instead of being a 14 year old girl with blonde hair, she was now a horse woman with a brown coat and a blonde mane and tail. Abby was rather nervous about showing her parents that not only was she older, but she was a completely different species. And that wasn&#39;t even including the fact that she and Sam had sex after she had changed.<br />
<br />
Of course, just talking with her parents wasn&#39;t going to be simple. For starters, she had outgrown her riding clothes and it probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to have her parents see their horse woman daughter in the buff. Obviously, Abby wasn&#39;t able to wear her jeans, but she was able to loop one pant leg around her waist and another between her legs to make an impromptu bottom. Of course, her wide hips and muscular ass wasn&#39;t making her bottom look very modest, but at least it covered up. There was no chance her shirt could be wrapped around her large breasts though. It wouldn&#39;t even get all the way around her wider back. But fortunately, there enough empty grain sacks in the barn for Abby to make a basic wrap around her breasts. The ensemble was a bit ludicrous and it didn&#39;t do anything to hide Abby&#39;s muscular yet curvaceous body. But at the very least, her nipples and groin were covered so her parents wouldn&#39;t at least freak out about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why I have to wear this silly thing,&quot; grumbled Sam. Another grain sack had been used to make a sort of kilt around Sam&#39;s waist. It wasn&#39;t much more modest than Abby&#39;s get-up and it looked rather silly with the bridle and saddle he was still wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because humans have a taboo about nudity,&quot; said Abby, &quot;I know it might seem redundant, but I think Mom and Dad are going to be more accepting of us if we&#39;re not totally naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they&#39;re not going to accept the two of us together like this, I doubt they&#39;re gonna care about what we wear or don&#39;t wear either,&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
Abby sighed. Sam may have been given human intelligence, but he was still pretty simple-minded. Though that was more from being recently made sentient than just being dumb. Even so, Abby did care about her big stallion a lot. He was a particularly handsome horse, with black fur, heavyweight bodybuilder muscles, and only a few inches taller than Abby herself, though Abby was easily taller than the average human. It wasn&#39;t hard to see why Abby was ready to mate with him after her metamorphosis. But before their relationship could go any further, she wanted to make sure she had her parents&#39; approval.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Abby&#39;s parents answered the door, they didn&#39;t seem very surprised by the sight of two horse people wearing minimal covering for modesty. Samson was easy to identify by his coloring, but Abby had a bit of a harder time. She eventually provided enough information to prove she was their daughter, but obviously they were still pretty skeptical. At least they let them into the house to let them explain further.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, let me get this straight,&quot; said Abby&#39;s father, &quot;You let Samson here drink from the stream and he started convulsing so you thought he was having a seizure. So you went to get help but eventually stumbled back across him, already changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s basically what happened,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t explain why you were changed like him,&quot; said Abby&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did touch him so I guess whatever was in him spread to me,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t explain why you&#39;ve become a full-grown mare instead of a filly of the same age,&quot; said Abby&#39;s father, &quot;Did anything in particular happen that might have done that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby swallowed and tried to think of a good answer. She exchanged a glance with Sam who just gave her a nod. Abby sighed and decided she might as well tell the truth now. &quot;He did get some of his sperm on me. And after I changed, we had sex,&quot; said Abby, her cheeks flushing hard under her brown coat.<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s father just gave an exasperated groan but Abby&#39;s mother snapped, &quot;Abigail Brown, do you have any idea how reckless that was? There was no telling how the virus could affect the reproductive system!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What virus?&quot; asked Abby.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Brown hesitated but Farmer Brown said, &quot;We might as well tell them since they&#39;re already mixed up in it. Abby, you and all those animals were changed because they&#39;ve come into contact with a virus that some scientists have been working on and we had been giving them some animals to test it with. It was supposed to make beef more nutritious by making the cattle stronger and healthier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like it worked a little too well,&quot; said Mrs. Brown, glancing out the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what was the virus doing in the water?&quot; asked Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing those scientists must have let it loose or something,&quot; said Farmer Brown, &quot;For all I know, every animal in 10 miles of here is gonna be turning half-human and joining this...what did you call it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalia,&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds idealistic,&quot; said Mrs. Brown, &quot;If the government will allow it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the government doesn&#39;t have to know,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they already know,&quot; said Mrs. Brown, &quot;Who do you think was funding those scientists and paying for the animals we sold them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact, we received a call not too long ago that they&#39;re going to send some agents to check our farm,&quot; said Farmer Brown, &quot;I expect they&#39;ll be here within half an hour at most.&quot;</p>
