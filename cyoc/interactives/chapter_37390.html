<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter watched his brother come home and head for their shared room. He heard him greet mother and Pete turned hit attention back to the telly program; Ash was on his way to getting another gym badge.<br />
<br />
After his program was over, he watched another. When his sister started to whine for mother, he decided that he wanted to go see his best friend Jerome. Waiting till a commercial break, he got up, passed Thomas as he stormed toward the kitchen. Ignoring him, he went to the room and began going through his toys; wondering if he should bring one with him.<br />
<br />
Thomas returned and started to put some broken trinket in several Ziploc bags, but Pete paid his brother no attention. When Thomas finished with that, he left. Knowing he was supposed to stay out of his brother's stuff, Peter crept toward the desk and opened the center drawer.<br />
<br />
Inside he saw the broken amulet and the first thing that crossed his mind was Pirate treasure. Taking the medallion from desk, Pete headed for out into the hallway. Making his way toward the front door of the apartment, he called out, &quot;Mom, I'm going over to Jerome's. Is it alright if I spend the night there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting a yes, he grabbed his shoes and coat, stuffed the amulet in his pocket and dashed out the door and down the hallway. Noticing the elevator going down, he figured it was his brother. Knocking on the door, he's greeted by Jackie, Jerome's baby sister.<br />
<br />
Being let in, he made his way toward his best friends room and knocking on that door, he's immediately greeted by a nine year old boy screaming, &quot;WHAT?!?&quot; Seeing his best friend, the anger left him and he invited Pete in.<br />
<br />
Asking him what's wrong, Jerome pointed to a couple of dolls on the floor and said, &quot;It's my stupid sister. First I catch her playing in my room and then she leaves her toys in here. I figure that I'd leave them there and refuse to give them back for awhile.&quot; Pete, not seeing the logic in this, only nodded at his friend.<br />
<br />
Taking from his pocket the amulet pieces in their individual bags, he showed them to Jerome and said to him, &quot;I think my older brother is Pirate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerome laughed at this and said, &quot;Get out of here. Thomas is a Pirate? Yeah right, prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dumping out the pieces onto the floor, Pete touched them until they once again resembled a full circle. Suddenly a bright blue flash came off the pieces, jumped to one of the dolls, jumped back and into Pete's hand. Staring at his hand, he heard Jerome swear and ask, &quot;What'd you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure how to answer, he heard Jerome move and looking away from his hand, he saw the same phenomenon happen to his friend. Whispering, &quot;I think we should put it away, it may be dangerous,&quot; Pete stood up and tried to walk to where he'd dropped the Ziploc bags.<br />
<br />
Only thing was, his legs felt strange, almost rubbery. As the feeling left his legs, Peter crumpled to the floor. As the same feeling over came his arms, he tried to look at Jerome and ask if he knew what was happening. But the problem was his head and neck had fused in place and so it was impossible to turn his head.<br />
<br />
Next the feeling crept over his torso and from there spread to his groin and abdomen. If it wasn't for the fact that his lips had fused together, he would have screamed in terror at the feeling of his penis and testicles shrinking until they finally disappeared.<br />
<br />
As a prickling sensation spread over his hair and the rest of his scalp, he felt his mouth reshape itself so that he had a minour overbite. As this happened, he felt a tickling sensation over his body and then he noticed that the room began to shift around him; something that was not very easy to do seeing as he could no longer move his head any more.<br />
<br />
As the room finished transforming, he noticed that it now resembled something closer to a storage closet. And then he heard a voice in his head asking, &quot;Pete, what just happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could answer, a girl's squeal of delight announced the presence of Jackie. Hearing her say, &quot;Lisa,&quot; he felt himself being picked up. After that, everything began to move weirdly as the girl picked up a Barbie doll and carried both from the room.<br />
<br />
Being laid down, he felt the girl moving her hands over his body and heard her say, &quot;Baby needs a diaper,&quot; at which point Pete felt something being pressed against his now flat crotch.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Jackie slipped a dress over his head and fastening the button in back, the world then shifted again as he felt himself being carried across the room. Suddenly Pete found himself being held before a full body mirror.<br />
<br />
As the girl said, &quot;Don't you look cute, Lisa?&quot; Pete saw what had happened.<br />
<br />
Somehow, he had been turned into a doll of Lisa Simpson. With this realization, he knew with out a doubt, the Barbie doll he saw earlier was Jerome. Thinking, &quot;Jerome, I think we're in big trouble,&quot; he felt Jackie sit him, now her, down at a table with three other dolls.<br />
<br />
All he heard from Jerome was, &quot;Yup.&quot;<br />
<br />
If he could, Pete would have cried, but he lacked any tear ducts; life as a girl's doll was going to prove interesting for the two who used to be human.</p>
