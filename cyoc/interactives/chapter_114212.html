<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their first stop after Benton gassed up his Lamborghini was not surprising Awareness. A clothing store that catered to active weres; providing clothing that can stretch and adjust to a were-beast shifting into their fursona, Benton was familiar with the establishment after getting his suits custom made there. While not as flashy as his Armani suits, Benton did find the suits from Awareness quite comfortable and they did take to his more bulky frame when in his were-panther form.<br />
<br />
Yet when his daughter dragged him into the store; Benton groaned as she took him to the area that sold more mundane clothing. Jeans, t-shirts, shorts; even sportswear, articles of clothing that Benton was loathed to put on.<br />
“All right dad,” Frieda grinning; “what do you see?”<br />
“An affront to my eyes and fashion sense,” Benton answering curtly; “You can’t expect me to try on shorts and t-shirts.”<br />
“Well you need more practical clothing for non-work related tasks,” Frieda grabbing a few shirts and jeans and tossing them to her father; “you can’t exactly wear a suit while puttering in the kitchen or doing yard work after mom nags you endlessly to use the riding mower. You want me to go on,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“No,” Benton knowing he was facing a losing battle; “But let’s establish a few ground rules. No shorts and no shirts without collars.”<br />
“All right,” Frieda rolling her eyes, before displaying a twisted grin; “but you shouldn’t be ashamed of your knobby knees.”<br />
<br />
Benton glares at his daughter before shaking his head.<br />
‘I don’t have knobby knees,’ Benton muttering to himself as he walks into the change room with the items Frieda first tossed to him. Before removing his clothes, Benton first examines what Frieda first tossed him. A pair of boot cut jeans, two long sleeve shirts and couple of T-shirts. <br />
“This is going to be a long day,” Benton sighing as starts to disrobe.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
An agonizing two hours later, Benton was happy that the whole ordeal of clothes shopping with his daughter was finally done. Carrying a couple bags full of new clothes to his car and stuffing them into the trunk, which so happened to be where the engine was typically housed. Yet this being a Lamborghini, the engine was in the rear of the car while the front compartment acted as a trunk.<br />
<br />
Benton had to grudgingly admit that the denim jeans would be useful for having to do yard work. A grueling chore he had to perform ever since his staff walked on him last year after decking his butler Jefferies. While John and Ethel came back to his employ; they didn’t return until after they got married and spent a few weeks in Caracas enjoying their honeymoon. Coming back roughly a week before Christmas Eve, it wasn’t until the start of 2016 that Benton was able to hire a new butler and two maids.  His new butler a were-tiger by the name of George; the man was a proper English gentleman. A former solider of the British military assigned to guard members of the royal family when residing at Windsor Castle, George spent most of his time acting as a manservant instead of bodyguard. The two maids were both were-cheetahs and sisters. Benton was hesitant at hiring them initially; knowing that were-cheetahs were typically bi-sexual or outright lesbians, the were-panther made it no secret that he was still a homophobe. Yet it was his father Anton slapping some sense into Benton and informing him that his daughter is bi-sexual and that he has grudgingly accepted that disturbing fact.<br />
<br />
The rest of his clothing purchases, were several shirts; some long sleeved and some short sleeved. All had collars and a few were button down shirts. While they weren’t the look Frieda was trying to get her father to go towards, she had to admit that her father was at least willing to try a new look. Yet she was dismayed when her father ordered a few more suits along with the various new clothes he bought.<br />
“You could have at least gotten the graphic tee,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“I told you,” Benton looks at his daughter, “no shirts without collars. Plus I wouldn’t be caught dead in public wearing a shirt that said what the one you tossed to me.”<br />
“You had a problem with I heart my daughter,” Frieda looking at Benton.<br />
“That wasn’t the shirt you tossed me,” Benton shaking his head; “you gave me one that said ‘Instant human, just add coffee.’<br />
“Oh the one with the grumpy monkey on it,” Frieda chuckling; “it’s not far from the truth though.”<br />
<br />
It was shortly after that they arrived at The Local Diner for lunch. Sitting down at a booth and ordering; for Benton it was a cheeseburger with pickles, while Frieda opted for the Italian sausage on a bun with hot pepper relish and mushrooms. Each also ordering a cola; Benton watches the waitress leave and then sees his daughter on her phone yet again.<br />
“What is going on to keep your eyes glued to your phone,” Benton asking his daughter.<br />
“Spencer and Eric are posting photos of Evan Junior on social media,” Frieda showing her father; “each holding onto the baby and Spencer’s parents looking thrilled at having a new child.<br />
“I see,” Benton looking at the images; thumbing through the many pictures and reading some of Frieda’s comments.<br />
“Dad,” Frieda looking thoughtful; “have you and mom considered having another child?”<br />
<br />
Benton sighed as he heard Frieda ask that question. Putting down Frieda’s phone, Benton waits for the waitress to leave with their drinks before answering.<br />
“We have,” Benton taking a sip of his soda; “we’ve discussed the matter several times in fact.”<br />
“And,” Frieda probing further; “will you and mom give me a brother or sister on day?”<br />
“That is not an easy answer to give,” Benton sighing; “why do you ask?”<br />
“Seeing Spencer bonding with her baby brother,” Frieda grabbing her phone and looking at the latest picture; “seeing her happy, it makes me jealous that I don’t get to experience that.”<br />
“I see,” Benton looking thoughtful; “if it makes you feel any better Frieda, your mother has brought this topic up several times. Yet,” Benton taking another sip of his soda; “there are a couple of reasons why we don’t go beyond talking about having another cub.”<br />
“Then what are the reasons,” Frieda looking at her father fidget nervously; knowing that this was a difficult conversation for him to have.<br />
<br />
“The first reason and the obvious,” Benton speaking; “is that Amanda and I are afraid that our second child could be Bi-polar like me.”<br />
“That’s a risk I’ll have with my children,” Frieda looking at her father; “that doesn’t mean Eric and I aren’t going to start a family with Spencer.”<br />
“I know,” Benton sighing; “it’s the same with your Uncle. Both of you are not be Bi-polar, but that doesn’t mean you don’t carry the gene. But like I said that was one reason. The second reason,” Benton taking another sip of his soda; “is you.”<br />
“Me,” Frieda looking confused; “how is that a reason?”<br />
“Frieda,” Benton sighing; “it’s no secret that your mother and I screwed up as parents to you. Never around when you needed us and treating you like an object to flaunt and impress our social peers. Do you think it would be fair to you if we had another child, without at first trying to repair the divide with you?”<br />
“No it wouldn’t be fair,” Frieda not liking what her father said; “but you have been trying.”<br />
“Yes,” Benton continuing; “yet how quickly would that rift reformed if we spent time with your brother or sister, trying to not make the same mistakes we did with you. You may not realize this,” Benton getting emotional; “but when you started calling me dad instead of father, you don’t know how happy I was with that small change. You know change isn’t easy for me,” Benton drinking his soda yet again; “finding out I was bi-polar and having to take pills and talk to a therapist just to manage my condition. I won’t lie to you Frieda; I was pissed. Mad as hell and wanting to lash out. Being forced to change my lifestyle,” Benton finishing his soda; “it’s a daily struggle for me. I guess you could say that is the third reason why Amanda and I haven’t had another child. I&#39;m afraid of further change.”<br />
<br />
There was an awkward pause when the waitress came back with their lunch; Benton asking for a refill for his drink, he stares at his burger. Not feeling like eating now; his appetite is further killed as he watches his daughter attack her sausage by slowly inserting one end into her mouth and biting off a big piece. To Benton, the way he watched Frieda eat, it was clear she was no stranger to oral sex; a form of intercourse he and Amanda haven’t performed in a very long time.<br />
“You’re not eating dad,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“The chat we had,” Benton telling a half-truth; “killed my appetite. Perhaps I’ll take my burger to go and have it after we get home.”<br />
“Were not going home just yet,” Frieda quickly finishing her sausage; “there is one thing I want us to do, and it is something you should consider especially what happen after last night.”<br />
<br />
Benton perks up and stares at her daughter. Instantly curious as to what she had in mind; more so after men dared to break into his home while he wasn’t there. Passed out drunk at his brother’s place; leaving Frieda alone with her friends as they baby sat three young were-tiger cubs. Their only protection being their butler George.<br />
“What did you have in mind,” Benton accepting the second soda from the waitress and then asking her if it was possible to take his burger to go.<br />
“We head to the local animal shelter and get a dog,” Frieda staring at her father and gauging his reaction.</p>
