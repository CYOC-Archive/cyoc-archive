<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Teddy and Jamie had BOTH been completely bewildered by Simon and Marty&#39;s transformation. It was even more surprising than Jamie and Mari&#39;s transformation back at the base. But the new guard-dogs took their transformation quite well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys... I&#39;m... sorry we made friends when we promised not to.&quot; Jamie said bashfully, hoping he wasn&#39;t in too much trouble.<br />
<br />
The two guard-dogs gave the rabbit a big hug. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Jamie!&quot; Said Jamie. &quot;I think, we became friends because we needed to become friends.&quot; <br />
<br />
Teddy was split between keeping the camera with him or not since he remembered his promise to his sister not to make friends with anyone at the hospital, if he showed them the picture, would they become friends too? Teddy chose to leave the camera with Jamie just in case, a promise was a promise. Teddy was now back with Tom and Jill, explaining the scary encounter he&#39;d had with his friends with the imp girl.<br />
<br />
Tom and Jill accepted what Teddy said without hesitation, after everything that happened, or rather, what Teddy hadn&#39;t done, the proud new parents found themselves trusting their brother/brother-in-law, in his claims of having basically seen a demon. Teddy didn&#39;t mention Simon and Marty just yet, since he was super confused about that too.<br />
<br />
Simon and Marty were likely doing their best to explain that the baby furs had NOT broken their promise, and two had effectively become baby furs ON THEIR OWN! <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, have you seen any of us LIE before?&quot; Simon the Labrador Retriever said as close to exasperated as a baby fur could go, &quot;Check the camera recordings, they&#39;ll show that they didn&#39;t force us to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you?&quot; Asked the nurse at the desk rather freaked out at seeing two NEW baby furs. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Because we saw something I think that made us realize that we needed to.&quot; Simon said, as somberly as before.<br />
<br />
Jamie was with his two new friends. He wondered where Mari was... wasn&#39;t Teddy supposed to be her responsibility? Responsibility was really important.  Marty the German Shepard and Simon both understood responsibility, looking at the video, it was like it was their -responsibility- to be baby furs. <br />
<br />
Jamie and Marty remembered every detail of why they hadn&#39;t liked the baby furs before... they turned people into zombies, they turned people into people who weren&#39;t those people anymore, they made friends with not-friends whether those not-friends wanted to be friends or not... but now being in fur and diapers themselves (speaking of which, Simon had actually been needing to go before his change, and emptied it into his diaper without a first thought, the diaper cleaning itself instantaneously), the two of them decided that it wasn&#39;t so bad after all, in fact, it actually felt really good. And they certainly didn&#39;t feel like their memories belonged to somebody else. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marty,&quot; Simon whispered, easy to do with their large dog ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If Teddy&#39;s video was shown on-line... would anyone who&#39;d see it turn into baby furs too you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marty wondered about that. &quot;They might... what happened to us was really weird though. And the last thing we wanna do is starting not-friends being super scared of becoming friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was always scared of needles, but my parents always said they were for my own good so I didn&#39;t get sick... maybe we just need a way for not-friends to realize that becoming friends is for their own good?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Unlike their other baby furs, Simon and Marty, perhaps from their own transformation, were not increasingly oblivious to those who were transformed (as what happened on the space station), but instead, had a powerful, instinctive thought that making friends with everyone was something that NEEDED to happen the way you needed to save someone from a burning building. But neither was mindlessly running around Making Friends with every Not-Friend they saw. Whatever that Bad Girl was, they knew that people being afraid of Becoming Friends, was only going to HELP that Bad Girl.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Tom&#39;lith had been a simple computer geek before becoming an imp. She&#39;d been a quite overweight young man more interested in a quiet peaceful future in programming than anything major. But she&#39;d also been the big brother to the best friend of Princess. She hadn&#39;t had glasses as a human, but since her transformation into an imp, she now had a square of square glasses that never left her face. <br />
&#39;Smart people wear glasses.&#39; Princess had said.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;Lith had asked once if that made Princess dumb, and got thrown off the top of the tower as counter argument. After climbing all the stairs back to the top floor (Princess&#39; tower would have earned praise from Sauron), Tom&#39;lith had chosen never to mention it again. <br />
<br />
Like all imps, her body was an adorable parody and imitation of adulthood. She was flat as a board, with no curves to speak up, and smooth as rubber with all the finer details of a cheap child&#39;s doll. Yet anything she wore turned into the same white clothes. Finger less arm long gloves, and toeless long &#39;socks&#39; that were more like the same of her &#39;gloves&#39; and a standard &#39;bunnie girl&#39; swimsuit like vest. Her horns were short and practical at least. Her tail twisted in knots from worry. She was likier than most, she&#39;d seen some VERY STRANGE imps. <br />
<br />
&#39;For being creatures of chaos, we sure are consistent about a lot of stuff.&#39; Tom&#39;lith thought. Princess hadn&#39;t cared much about learning more about her new kind, as long as she was in charge, and her One Rule (imps related by blood would not harm each other) was obeyed, Princess was interested in only her own fun. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d been given the job of spying on the alternate reality they&#39;d found a way to invade... And had found Jill&#39;lith&#39;s alternate reality counterpart, still human. Tom&#39;Lith genuinely wondered if Princess was the First Fur&#39;s counterpart or not. <br />
<br />
At least once this invasion nonsense was over, hopefully Princess would get bored and not want to invade another, or get back to that space program some imps had been wanting, and Tom&#39;Lith could go back to designing incredibly violent video games. Maybe she could work with whoever her counterpart was, assuming they weren&#39;t a baby fur already.<br />
<br />
Given Princess&#39; moods... Tom&#39;lith was utterly TERRIFIED of telling Princess the news of what had just happened from the camera&#39;s eyes... that rabbit solider had shown two men a picture of Jill&#39;lith turning a horse into a plush puppet, and... they turned into baby furs?! <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;lith wanted to put it off for eternity if she could, but the more she delayed, she knew the more angry Princess would be for being kept out of the loop. Best to get it over with. <br />
<br />
In the middle of the &#39;pre-victory party&#39; as Princess called it, what with the baby furs apparently losing their interest in immunizing more humans into baby furs from the imp curse now only being a matter of time... Tom&#39;lith tapped Princess on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
Thirty seconds later, Tom&#39;lith was diving for cover, along with the other party guests, as Princess shape changed into a giant red DRAGON, and spewed fire everything! <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR! THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR! THAT&#39;S NOT FAIR! THAT&#39;S CHEATING! CHEATERS! CHEATER! CHEATERS!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;lith wisely decidedly NOT to mention how Princess had been inventing newer and cleverer ways to transform humans into imps right up until the entire planet&#39;s population had become Chaos&#39; adopted daughters. That the baby furs seemed to keep figuring out ways to convert humans... felt almost fitting.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;lith got pulled (rather painfully) on her poor tail as was hung upside down looking into Princess&#39; face, still shape shifted into a giant dragon. &quot;YOU! CHECK ON YOUR CURSED IMP MEME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s proven that it can keep the baby furs away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to make sure it&#39;s turning those who use it into imps too idiot! They better be!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;Lith was dropped onto the floor, she was actually happy she was an immortal chaos spirit, or she&#39;d have fractured her skull. <br />
<br />
&quot;R-right on it princess!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AND I WANT AN ANSWER NOW!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Right Princess.&quot;</p>
