<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin nestled in the sweet smelling straw as memories of a boy growing up mixed with the thought pattern of his pet pony. It was like seen a double feature movie but both being played on the same screen at once.<br />
<br />
The sound of the stable groom talking to his horses jolted Erin back to humanity. Scrambling for his clothes he walked past the groomsman as if nothing were wrong at all. <br />
<br />
Up the back service entrance he ran, to the upstairs bedrooms and into a safe haven. Even Erin could smell the scents of mare and manure as he undressed for a hot shower.<br />
<br />
The full length mirror told of a new arrangement. The sight of his once scar clear skin now was changed from pretty and pink to a hard thick leather tanned to almost black color. The dapple gray hairs which once only graced his groin and butt, now ran down his legs and covered his feet. <br />
<br />
Turning to see his back the mirror now reflected a different looking back of heavy muscles covered by a hide of black and more hair. Oh how he smoothed his fingers over the solid muscles. The tickle of his very thick Winter coat of Shetland pony hair felt so neat. A shiver made the goose pimples pop and a sexual monster grow.<br />
<br />
The well remembered crinkling feeling of his pony cock swelling out of the sheath made Erin stare at the reflection. Inch after glorious inch pushed out as the member swelled to full size.  Memories of his long thrilling night became lusty thoughts which made him almost snort for the pleasure to begin.<br />
<br />
Now standing, looking at one's reflection he held his arms out straight as if they had become forelegs. Looking at his side view the aching pony cock held it's male pose. Thighs were broader from the hip down to his knees. The with cover his testicles in what the stable groom taught his was a stifle. <br />
<br />
The dappled gray pony hair stopped at his shoulders but now covered his chest as well. The odd sense that his tight stomac muscles had given way to a start to a potbelly look of the Shetland stallion Mike.<br />
<br />
A hot shower made Erin feel cleaner and almost human till he dried his hairy body. As he looked at the medicine cabinet the salve jars stared back at him. He looked at them and suddenly picked up one still full jar. Opening it his fingers slurped out a big glob and he began to smeer it over his whole body.<br />
<br />
Head, face, neck, chest, belly, sheath, stifle, thighs, back, buttocks, legs and feet. Then he walked out into the Winter's sunshine on his balcony. The crisp cold air tingled his entire form. Closing his eyes Erin wished for many more nightly romps with those lusty mares. Females now meant mares as women had no real appeal at all now.<br />
<br />
A sharp pain made Erin jump to attention. As his eyes opened they clenched shut as the pains swelled over his haed and down the spine. A groan increased to a scream of sharp pain as he crouched down. Hands grabbed ankles as he went into a tight tuck down to the ground. Minutes passed as the pain level remained the same till all of a sudden it was gone.<br />
<br />
Now strangely comfortable in the chilly air Erin went back inside the bedroom. Closing the french doors to the balcony he walked into the still warm and steamy bathroom.<br />
<br />
Erin's view of a reflection from the half steamed mirror made him wonder if he'd ever get back to school again. The salve had done more changes and he looked much more a pony stallion than a young human male.<br />
<br />
The very shape of his head had changed. Lips and nose were merging in what he knew was a pony muzzel. Facial pony hair now grew in patches of white, gray, and black colors. A stiff stubble of course hairs sprouted from atop his head and ran in a straight cream colored line down his neck to the shoulders. Ears too had hair on them as they were pointed and looking too much like pony ears.<br />
<br />
Turning on the tile floor made him look to see what made the noise. Hoofs, his toes were gone and hoofs had formed in their place. His feet were much longer and the knees were into a crouch. New tight muscles made the crouch as he looked at a tail swishing the air to his rear.<br />
<br />
Hanging onto the coutertop he held his balance while craning his neck to look at the thick bushy cream colored tail. Indeed his fated touch of Mike's old hide had with the salves help begun his change into that fine pet pony.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a thought, the party was tonight! Erin clomped over to the bed and picked up his cel phone. A check of information and he soon heard the phone ring at the ointment shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEELLO!&quot; said the man's elderly voice.<br />
<br />
Erin told him who he was and began with the story of his change. Leaving out the sex drive part along with mounting mares he asked if there was a way to halt the spreading changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes young Sir!&quot; replied the shop owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fill a bathtub with very hot water, put about a quart of white vinegar into the tub a mix it well. Add baking soda, and soak in the mixture for one hour. The body should change back to all human. Oh remember do not give in to animal lusts!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of animal lust?&quot; asked Erin thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh if once lust of beast has been enjoyed the salve takes the body over and the animal you would become. Did you have sex with a mare?&quot; asked the shop owner in a carefilled voice.<br />
<br />
Erin broke down and told of his zoophilia experiance. Details upon details of his feelings and strange memories. The old man listened and then broke into the confession.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are as the lust shall keep you, A Shetland stallion is what the body and mind will become. I have no possible way to stop your change from here. Suggest you find a comfortable stable and learn to accept the life of a pony.&quot; with that the man hung up the phone and Erin was alone.</p>
