<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Aaron woke up first he was cuddled up with Geoff who was sleeping on his back with his mom wide open. He watched the boy sleep while his hand found its way inside his undies grabbing himself; he rubbed his foreskin while his other hand slowly entered Geoff&#39;s open mouth. He felt Geoff&#39;s hot breath blowing across his fingers as he lightly pushed them against Geoff&#39;s wet tongue, he closed his eyes and let out a shuddering sigh. Geoff stirred slightly and Aaron quickly pulled his hand out of the boy&#39;s mouth and put it into his own. Sucking on his wet fingers he knew that he would need more; he just had to find out how.<br />
       Aaron slipped out of bed and dashed into the bathroom pulling his penis out of his undies as he ran. Little boys definitely had smaller bladders. He barely made it to the toilet before a stream of yellow liquid shot out of his penis and splashed into the bowl frothy and yellow. The scent filled the bathroom and Aaron found himself filled with curiosity about what it tasted like? Would he like it? He was still peeing so he grabbed a cup they left next to the sink and placed it under his penis. He was able to fill it slightly before he ran out. Setting it down he shook his penis sending drops of pee across the toilet rim. After pulling his foreskin back over his glans he picked up the cup and smelled it. It smelled like a urinal, slightly off put by the smell he brought it to his lips and tilted it back quickly almost like a shot of liquor. He gagged and spurtted but managed to swallow it. It was warm and salty but not too bad. He set the cup down and turned to leave the bathroom and found Geoff watching him. “ You dirty little boy drinking your own pee like that you should be ashamed” he entered the bathroom his penis already hanging out of the hole in his undies “ give me the cup I wanna try some to” he took the cup and held it under his limp penis and peed into the cup filling it to the top before directing his stream into the toilet “ damn I needed to go!” Aaron stood next to Geoff watching him “ same here we definitely have small bladders”. Geoff finished up shaking his penis and leaving his foreskin back and rubbing his glans “ it feels good when I do this I think I&#39;m super close to being able to get an erection”. Letting go of his penis and letting it flop limply he held the cup to his lips and started drinking. He drank quickly, breathing through his nose before triumphlety putting the empty cup on the counter “ ha!”. Aaron wrinkled his nose “ eww your breath smells like a urinal”. Geoff exhaled in Aaron&#39;s direction “ so do you urinal boy” Aaron playfully pushed Geoff “ I&#39;m not a urinal boy your a urinal boy” Geoff grabbed Aaron&#39;s arms and spun him around pulling him so he was facing away his butt pressing against his still exposed penis “ I don&#39;t know why you even try fighting me I&#39;ve always been stronger than you” Aaron struggled playfully grinding his butt against Geoff&#39;s penis “ let me gooo” he whined but trying desperately not to laugh. “ Listen up little slut I was awake earlier when you were touching my tongue I know you enjoyed it and you wanna do it again right” Aaron nodded “ ok now listen up, I will spit on you, drool on you, lick you, let you play with my tongue heck you can even brush my teeth if you want but” he tightened his grip on Aaron&#39;s arms “ I need you to be more confident, more authoritative make me yours touch me when I say no make me touch you when I say no and if I disobey you… punish me” Aaron looked over his shoulder in surprise, who was this semi naked little boy? What had he done to the quiet and shy man he had married “ what happened to you?” Geoff released Aaron and grabbed his shoulders” I&#39;ve always felt this way but I was too afraid to ask until you asked me to spit on you and being little boys again just seemed like it was the right time to “ he trailed off. Staring into those innocent hazel eyes those same hazel eyes that had proposed to him those same loving eyes that had cared for him when he was sick, the same eyes that had told him everything was going to be ok after his parents had kicked him out for being gay. He leaned closer pressing his lips against Aaron&#39;s and kissed him, he could still taste the pee on Aaron&#39;s tongue and he loved it. Pushing his tongue fully inside Aaron&#39;s mouth and rubbing against Aaron&#39;s tongue caused the smaller boy to stumbled slightly as he moaned into Geoff&#39;s mouth. They passionately made for what  for what felt like seconds before the boys broke away breathing heavily “ l love you so much I&#39;ll do anything to make you happy” Aaron whispered softly before he gently grabbed Geoff&#39;s penis and used it as a handle “ now let&#39;s get something to eat I&#39;m starving” he left the bathroom pulling Geoff behind him.<br />
      Pouring bowls of super sugary cereal they sat down “ no penises at the table put it away” making a face Geoff pushed his penis back into his undies “ that&#39;s better, if you behave you can be naked after we eat” Aaron said all this with a mouthful of chewed up cereal brightly colored drool dripping down his chin “ promise? Cause I really wanna see you naked again” Geoff giggled while rubbing himself through his undies “ of course! But only boys who do what they are told get to be naked, now swallow and open your mouth and stick your tongue out!” Geoff swallowed and obediently opened his mouth sticking his tongue out” come closer” he scooted over and Aaron grabbed his tongue and started inspecting his mouth” unacceptable when was the last time you flossed?” Geoff shrugged, unable to fully articulate an answer” I guess I&#39;ll have to brush and floss for you won&#39;t I?” Now finish up and let&#39;s go get cleaned up, I wanna try something.<br />
           The boys went to the bathroom and got ready to brush their teeth. Aaron got Geoff&#39;s toothbrush ready “ sit” he pointed to the edge of the bathtub “ and open your mouth as wide as you can” Geoff sat down and opened his mouth sticking his tongue out while slipping his fingers inside his undies “ now let&#39;s get you cleaned up!” Aaron started brushing Geoff&#39;s teeth while kneeling down and looking inside the boy&#39;s mouth. After 3 minutes of brushing he stepped back” ok now I want you to spit into my mouth!” He looked positively delighted and sat down on the floor with his mouth wide open. Geoff stood up and walked over his cheeks bulging with after brushing slobber. Standing over Aaron he opened his mouth, spitting the entire minty frothy mix over Aaron&#39;s face and into his mouth. Aaron moand and swallows while rubbing the rest across his face. Geoff watched him while jerking and playing with his soft penis” that&#39;s gross Aaron but kinda hot” Aaron stood up and took his undies off “ wanna suck my penis!” Geoff quickly ripped his own undies off “ thought you&#39;d never ask” the boys went to the bed and laid down facing each other&#39;s penis. They started sucking on each other&#39;s soft warm penises, closing their eyes and moaning softly, while not as pleasurable as when they got erections it still felt good enough that they didn&#39;t want to stop. They gave up after a few minutes and just casually played with each other&#39;s penis. “ What should we do today?” Aaron sat up “ I&#39;ve been thinking about that, it&#39;s way really nice outside. We should definitely go to the park again but I don&#39;t wanna spend all day watching cartoons. I wanna run around and play with other kids”. <br />
      After getting dressed they left the apartment taking care about being seen before making their way to the playground. It wasn&#39;t as crowded as the other day but it was just after lunch. They sat down on the swings and rode them kicking their legs going higher and higher “ watch me jump off!” Geoff yelled before pushing himself off at the swings forward peak, flying through the air he landed and skidded across the wood chips before scrambling to his feet “ your turn!”. Not to be out done Aaron kicked his legs harder pushing himself slightly higher than Geoff before he jumped. He flew through the air and landed almost cat-like on his feet absorbing the impact with his knees. Springing back up he raised his arms in victory “ I win!” Geoff brushed the wood chips off his scraped up knees, angry red lines of abraded skin disappearing up his shorts “ are you ok?” Aaron stepped closer with concern written across his face “ I&#39;m fine, I forgot that you used to do gymnastics when you were little I guess it&#39;s muscle memory” Aaron nodded and looked around spotting a grown-up watching them. He waved and gave a thumbs up “ what are you doing?” Aaron looked back at Geoff “ the last thing we need is someone asking where our parents are”. The boys left the swings and climbed up the jungle gym hanging upside down from their knees “ first one to drop is bottom for the week” Aaron giggled and rocked back and forth “ don&#39;t tempt me with a good time”. They started getting dizzy and rolled themselves off dropping lightly to the weird rubberized matting “ kinda wish we had this stuff when we were kids feels better than wood chips”.<br />
       A skinny boy with shockingly blonde hair and sky blue eyes ran over to them “ hi! I&#39;m Scotty, wanna play with me? He looked to be about their age with scraped up scabbing knees and elbows “ my family just moved here I&#39;m Scotty” Aaron recovered first “ hi, I&#39;m Aaron and that&#39;s Geoff we&#39;re brothers” Geoff waved “ cool! I wish I had brothers. I just have an older sister and she never plays with me. I have a soccer ball wanna play!” Geoff and Aaron looked at each other trying to communicate without talking, this was a little boy asking them to play would it be okay? Aaron shrugged, “ sure let&#39;s play.”<br />
      Scotty jumped excitedly and ran quickly to a bag and pulled out a well used soccer ball. “ I love playing soccer. I wanna join a team when school starts. What school do you guys go to? He was talking rapidly, apparently excited about the chance of making new friends so soon.” We just moved here with our uncles cause….” Geoff&#39;s voice trailed off as Aaron glared at him “ what happened to your mom and dad?” Scotty asked almost rudely “ Aaron and Geoff were both looking at their feet, “ they were in a car accident let&#39;s go play”. They kicked the ball around and it was immediately apparent that Scotty was an incredible player, easily beating both boys.” Your really good!” Scotty kicked the ball and it sailed across the field before getting caught in the netting “ I wanna play with a team when school starts” The boys failed to notice the setting sun and only became aware when a teenage girl yelled out “ Scotty get your skinny butt in the house! It&#39;s dinner time!” She marched away and Scotty picked up his ball “ I gotta go wanna play again some time?” Aaron and Geoff agreed and they swapped phone numbers. While making their way home Geoff and Aaron talked about Scotty “ it&#39;s definitely something I didn&#39;t think about when we started this I mean he&#39;s actually a little kid” Aaron nodded and kicked a rock “ why the hell did we tell him our parents were dead?” Geoff looked at him “ what happens if he comes over and sees two grownups both guys we had to come up with something” Aaron shook his head side to side “ this changes everything one of us is gonna have to be little every day after work Fuck! What if he asks why we aren&#39;t in school?” They entered the cool apartment and grabbed some water before undressing” ouch “ Geoff stumbled slightly as he pulled his shorts off. &quot;Need a band-aid?” Geoff shook his head” nah I&#39;m fine just some scraped up knees” after finishing their water they went to shower before finding something in the kitchen kids could make for dinner.</p>
