<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Is there anything that your machines can’t do, Nancy?” “Well, as of this moment, they could only run a single program. And the program that I am running is to run a “Transformation For A Day” one. Other than that, it seems like they can do anything. Even this apparently.” <br />
After recovering from the shock of her daughter looking like a stuffed turkey, Penelope stayed the night over and tried her hardest to take care of her. Not wanting to share this sensitive “condition” with the rest of the family, Penelope had sent a quick message that she would be staying at her daughter&#39;s place, much to the sadness of everyone back home. So with half the day of cooking and the other half of eating, Penelope and Nancy had bonded together.<br />
<br />
After having the Thanksgiving dinner that couldn’t be beaten, everyone went to sleep soon after. And, like clockwork, Charlotte changes again. On the outside, she is still overwhelmingly big and round. But on the inside, the hundreds of pounds had dropped down to the tens of pounds. This is mostly because the solid fats within her had turned into a gas, helium to be precise.<br />
So imagine the surprise that happened in the morning when both Nancy and Penelope discovered that Charlotte was on the ceiling, snoring in a very high pitch. This led to the dialogue at the beginning of the story, with the two women staring at the living Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Balloon.<br />
<br />
“Well, I would love to stay here when she is, well,” Penelope said while looking at her daughter, “But I have a train to catch in the morning and I can’t stay here.” Nancy went up and hugged the older woman. “You don’t need to worry about a thing ma’am,” Nancy said while still hugging. “I will make sure that your daughter won’t land on a needle or a tack when she comes down.”<br />
“SQUEAK! SQUEAK!” was the only sound that Charlotte could say, seeing how limited her mouth could move along with all the helium in her body sending it to such a high pitch. “Relax squeaky,” Nancy called up to her panicking balloon, “I will make sure that when you decide to come down, you will land on the softest blanket in the house.”<br />
<br />
So with a heavy heart, and a gassy body, Charlotte waved her little, plump hand at her mom while she got in the car that took her to the station. The rest of the day was filled with Nancy cleaning up the mess that was Charlotte’s bed. But to please her currently stuck friend, Nancy played some music from her computer to keep her entertained.<br />
After many hours, and multiple trash bags worth of the broken bed frame, Nancy managed to clean it up enough so that her friend could come down easily. Charlotte meanwhile just stays on the ceiling, mentally thinking about getting a brand new bed frame when she can go outside without the fear of flying away.<br />
<br />
Time passes at Charlotte’s house. Long enough that Nancy heated some of the leftovers from the feast with Charlotte being unable to join in given the circumstances. By the time it got close to midnight, Nancy placed down multiple blankets below Charlotte, along with some pillows to go with it for some extra comfort. <br />
“It’s a bit of a shame that you floated up there instead of still being on the ground,” Nancy said to Charlotte just before the clock struck midnight. “Squeak?” Charlotte said as if to say, “What do you mean?” “Because I bet that you would’ve made a great air mattress.” Nancy didn’t need to guess what Charlotte’s squeaking meant after her bad joke. Then the alarm clock on Nancy&#39;s phone beeped. “Midnight, Charlotte.”<br />
<br />
At first, Charlotte made some more squeaking noises, as if she was talking. But then there was more noise coming out from Charlotte’s body that was different from her usual squeaks. Something like air escaping from a balloon, a constant, high-pitched sound emanating from her. That&#39;s when Charlotte began to come down. <br />
It was a slow descent but to Charlotte, it&#39;s better than nothing. With the helium leaving her body, Charlotte could move more of her hands and her head, allowing her the slight ability to inspect her shrinking body. Even her face has deflated enough to allow her to see and speak, albeit with a voice like a chipmunk.<br />
<br />
“I’m… coming down… Nancy,” Charlotte squeaked out, still out of breath with the gas escaping from her. “Oh my god, your voice! Quick, sing the witch doctor song while you are still high!” Never had Nancy seen a blimp that gave such a menacing look before. Well, except for when she did a school report on the Hindenburg explosion that she hoped to not repeat here.<br />
“I swear… that when… I get down,” Charlotte huffs and puffs her warning, not noticing that she had shifted in the air. When she was fully inflated, Charlotte’s back was against the top of the room. But as she was coming down, her body repositioned so that her bottom would hit the floor before her belly. <br />
<br />
With the constant rate of air loss, Charlotte could see more of her arm and her head began to separate away from her upper body. Everything was deflating back down to her normal figure before all this madness. All except for the legs.<br />
Unlike the rest of her depressing body, Charlotte’s legs exploded in size. Comparable to a BLL, nearly all of her body fat had been moved to her thighs, her hips, and her ass. And her ass had the lion’s share of the weight distribution.<br />
<br />
“Nancy! What is… going on… with me?” Charlotte huffed out with her high-pitched voice. Nancy hopped on her computer and with a few short taps figured out what was happening. “Well, I got some bad news and some worse news. What do you want to know first?” <br />
With only those two options, Charlotte squeaked, “Bad,” with the hope that it would at least be the lesser of the two evils.<br />
<br />
Nancy cleared her throat and said seriously, “What you have is something called a “Hyper Butt”. While it varies from woman to woman, the result is always having a giant ass.” Charlotte, with her belly shrunken enough to allow her to bend at her waist, looked behind at her posterior. If it wasn’t a part of her body, Charlotte would’ve thought that someone stuck a beanbag on her butt.<br />
“And the… worst news?” Charlotte gasped out, with her voice slowly dropping in pitch. “All the weight that you had the day before yesterday when you were all fat?” Charlotte nodded with her chins receding in her body. “It’s back. All that weight is coming back and it&#39;s going straight to your thighs!”<br />
<br />
At that point, Charlotte had made it to the ground. Bouncing once or twice until she came to a complete halt on the soft blankets. Then she felt the expansion crank up, just like when she was trying to hide from her mother a couple of days ago.<br />
Her vision rose higher, from being the same height as her friend to growing higher than that. Before she knew it, her vision had risen to over three feet in height due to how much junk was in her trunk, making her taller than if she was standing.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t end there either. With her thighs grown with her, Charlotte’s legs just hang in the air with no way of touching the ground. Even her hips have spread far past her arm span, making Charlotte feel like the world’s biggest pear. No matter which way she looked, all she could see was a sea of her flesh.<br />
But everything above Charlotte’s waist was back to the normal amount of body fat before yesterday. Even her breasts were back to their nominal size for her to wear her shirts and dresses again. <br />
<br />
“I think all the gas escaped,” Charlotte said, happy to hear her normal voice back again. Nancy, a little downtrodden, just turned off her computer and sadly made her way to the door. “Hey, where are you going?”<br />
Nancy looked back and said in the saddest voice possible, “Well, it’s just that, I know that you don’t like me to jump on to you when you are like this. So I am going back to my bed and I will see you in the morning.”<br />
Charlotte thought for a moment, debated while she looked back at the shelf of an ass that she now has. “Okay, Nancy. You can sleep on me.” And before she knew it, Nancy materialized on one of Charlotte’s butt cheeks. Not wanting to bother her, Charlotte snuggled up on her own personal mattress, enjoying the sensation of herself and her friend.</p>
