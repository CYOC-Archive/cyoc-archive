<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken's time machine was by far brighter than it's inventor as with one forward step he teleported into time long past.<br />
<br />
&quot;My companions of Olympus, this day we have a problem!&quot; announced Zeus.<br />
<br />
A twinkle of blue sparkle and a misty cloud appeared before Zeus' throne. The entire group of Gods and Godesses watched in pure facination. As if in slow motion a slim figure of a young man appeared within the mist as he stepped onto the marble floor of this great palace.<br />
<br />
Ken looked to right and left seeing his mistake in positioning. He'd rather have appeared in a less conspicuous place yet here he was a mortal in the middle of Mount Olympus' finest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day to you all from us in the far distant future!&quot; greeted Ken to his stunned onlookers.<br />
<br />
Hera was first to smile and offer a friendly greeting, then Mercury and so on down the long line of those in court that day. When at last Ken stood looking up at Zeus he smiled and said, Oh great, all knowing, all kind to mortals, best of friends to Europia, Io, and many others to which you endowed with part of yourself! I Kenneth of the future stand here wishing to speak and learn. I here would ask of thee Sire to help me witness the birth of Pan. I would, that for the written history of all time should tell the complete story!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeus stood up quickly and his eyes flashed with bolts of lightning. He raised his right hand as if to throw when from the circle of Gods stepped forward Helois.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay my great one! Throw not but listen to this one who knows far more of history! We here could learn from this one and if it be possible see our mistakes before they embarress us before mankind.&quot; announce Helois.<br />
<br />
Slowly Zeus sat down but the eyes in his head flashed of terrible fate for those who would cause him to be embarressed. Hera took Ken's hand and led him to a white marble bench a long distant from her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young mortal, I know of Europia and remember my husband's foolish ways! I have blessed many with disguises worthy of their ruddy life below! You though know of these is some detail while offering coming and yet untold embarressements to come. Therefore to prove your worth to the council we would know of some of these unseen affairs.&quot; asked Hera but in a way which made Ken very uneasy.<br />
<br />
All eyes and faces were turned to look at Ken as he began to tell of Io's bovine adventure. After just a few minutes Zeus got up slowly and walked from the council chamber. Hera watched him but kept her face looking at Ken as the story continued to unfold.<br />
<br />
Ken's well read knowledge to Greek and Roman myth seemed to make his audience grown and frown with wonderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is late, our guest must be both hungry and tired of his first day on the mount! Come Kenneth and let me show you a room made for a mortal's need of rest!&quot; beckoned Hera as Ken stood up to follow.<br />
<br />
Ken checked his elapsed time knowing that the Time Machine's clock only allowed him to stay in one place for a twentyfour hour period. A failsafe of being caught by situation unfolding around Ken which might make him an unwanted personage held in time.<br />
<br />
Hera swung open to huge bronze doors as Ken's jaw dropped. There before him was a large room, and round bed, a tub filled with water and to his erect delight a pair of female Satyr's to fill his night with pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold Kenneth this be your own palace of enjoyment! Treat him as if he were one of your own, sooth his manlyness and test his will till the light on day comes again!&quot; ordered Hera to the sweet smiling Satyrs.<br />
<br />
As Ken stepped past the door's threshold two great doors slammed shut. Walking toward his two beauties for the evening he smiled as his mind raced with terrors or fear of what to expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Mylissia! announced on Satyress as she clopped closer to Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Andria! announced the other as she poured a bottle of liquid into the bath water.<br />
<br />
Together the said, &quot;We are here to grant your most lusting desire while helping one find a perfect place to live out one's life, come!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nimble fingers quickly disrobed ken till he stood standing naked and very erect. Mylissia was first to fall onto hairy knees and with tongue extended she began to taunt Ken's sexual lusts.<br />
<br />
Andria poured a bottle of liquid over Ken's shoulders and began to smooth her hairy palms over his pink skin. Closing his eyes Ken drank in these attentions as this was his first ever encounter with Satyrs.<br />
<br />
Feelings and time mixed as after much friendly Satyr touching soothed Ken into a sensual uforia. One and then the other Satyress offered Ken pleasures he'd never have taken if not for the soft touches of female Satyrs wooed his manliness in so many ways.<br />
<br />
It was still the dark of night when those bronze doors swung open with a crash. Ken twisted his head as he looked over the left shoulder. As drips and strings of Mylissia's juices fell from Ken's lips the loud words of Zeus wrung out.<br />
<br />
Ken thought for a sudden second of what we was doing and how he must look to Zeus. Ken's face was deeply embedded into Mylissia's wet pussy as he licked her juices and his own semen from her warm hole. He felt Andria between his kneeling legs as she sucked his maleness with lusty intent.<br />
<br />
&quot;As would expect, you are nothing less than the most disgusting of male creatures which resides below! taunted Zeus at Ken.<br />
<br />
Swinging one leg over Andria's head Ken took a sitting position and looked up at Zeus. Hacking and spitting out Mylissia's juices till he could talk Ken wipped his sticky mouth with the back of his left hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, am I any different that the great white bull who sniffed and licked the juices of his friendly bovine cow Europia?&quot; chidded Ken back at Zeus. &quot;Be I any different than the Bull who mounted his lover several times till her sense and will took wing?&quot; said Ken as he hacked out a yellow glob of his own conjealed semen from a sticky throat. <br />
<br />
Zeus reached into a pocket stitched into the hip side of his toga and tossed a white ball into the steaming bath near Ken's bed. &quot;Bathe him, and when he is ready bring him to the midday meeting of the Council !&quot; ordered Zeus as he stepped back and the bronze doors slammed shut.<br />
<br />
One sudden rush of semen roared out of Ken's pecker and into the waiting Satyress between his legs. Soft hairy hands urged Ken toward the bath again as he wondered what was to happen the coming noon.<br />
<br />
Ken slipped down into the warm and relaxing waters as Mylissa and Andria slithered in as well. Flopping about in the warm water Ken humped one Satyress and then the other. Hours passed and the thrills continued as both Satyrs and their prey found enjoyment in each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;BONG, BONG,&quot; went a great bell as Mylissia burst from the bath water and grabbed a towel.<br />
<br />
Hearing the great bell Ken leaned over the side of his marble tub and cradled his chin with hairy hands. &quot;Forget the bell and come back to me my Lover!&quot; beckoned Ken as his lover held out a large white towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must dry you and prepare for the Council's meeting!&quot; begged Mylissia.<br />
<br />
Andria slipped from the cloudy water and stood before Ken while wiggling her nimble fingers into his hairy head. Slender hips were even with Ken's face as he taunted her with a long tongue pursing her hairy wet slit.<br />
<br />
Delighted with Ken's pleasuring of her sensual body she too urged him to come out and be dried of his bath.<br />
<br />
Ken climbed out of the high sided tub with much slipping and grabbing. He laughed as he groped for things to help him stand. A odd feeling of disbalance was making him uneasy while his sexual delights of the long evening made him smile.<br />
<br />
Mylissia dried her Lover' as Andria brushed and combed Ken's hair into fluffy waves.<br />
<br />
The three walked the hallowed halls as a few late Gods looked and starred at the sight. At last the three stood in the arch leading into the Council chambers.<br />
<br />
Zeus stood up from his throne and stretching out his left arm he announced, &quot;Behold to one and all of the Council I present our learned man of time as he truly likes to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
All heads turned to look toward the arch. Ken smiled back as the sound of laughter and applause echoed the marble walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh idiot, behold a learned man dooped into being what his lusting heart wished most!&quot; grumbled Hera.<br />
<br />
&quot;PING, Ping, ping!&quot; went Ken's wristwatch as he saw the rusty brown hair covering his arms, hands, and legs below. Standing arm in arm with his two very friendly Satyr's a blue haze began to surround them. Sparkles of stardust bounced about as Mylissia, Ken, and Andria were captured by the Time Machine.<br />
<br />
An echoing scream of &quot;NO!&quot; was the last the three heard as they stepped back into Ken's time and world.</p>
