<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And after that I headed back here where I met you and began giving you the back story on the last six months of my life,&quot; I told Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;And asking me if I would look after your girlfriend while you're training to join the police,&quot; Dave retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said earlier, Dave, you're the only one I trust to do this,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Molly and I may have blunted Beauregard's scheme, but his intention so far is to make us miserable in he hopes that it drives us out... but since Beauregard can't influence Officer Howard to do what he wants, I fear he'll arrange for Molly to have an &quot;accident&quot; while I'm away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get the whole accidentally hit by a car thing,&quot; Dave replied, &quot;I'm still not sure how having me there is going to help Molly all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't be as blatant,&quot; I told him, &quot;if no one is there when the &quot;accident&quot; happens, the only thing that would implicate Beauregard or some other R.A.M. member would be the fact that Beauregard hated Molly... but that would be inadmissible before any court of law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I'm there?&quot; Dave wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're there, there's a potential witness,&quot; I explained, &quot;you could identify who did it or attempted to do it and give some description of how the &quot;accident&quot; went. Beauregard won't take the risk of finding criminal charges coming against him. He thinks too highly of himself to take the risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He could also get overconfident and think nothing can harm him,&quot; Dave warned, &quot;I've overheard a lot of guys mumble things over the year or so I've been here... nothing like what you say he's pulled on you and Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;I know, and that is why I need your help. Just to look after Molly while I'm gone. Make sure she's okay. Ask her if she needs any help or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave sighed and then slowly nodded, &quot;I suppose I can do that... I mean, what are friends for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I sighed with relief, &quot;I'll owe you one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No speeding tickets would be good,&quot; Dave said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Officer Howard won't let me do that,&quot; I shook my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was worth a shot,&quot; Dave shrugged, &quot;So where is Molly? I assumed that you wanted me to meet her by coming up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; I nodded, &quot;but Molly has her work today and won't be back till later... though I've lost track of time with as long as my story was...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then paused to turn to a small clock and looked at it...<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah, she should be back soon,&quot; I said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
Dave nodded and looked around, &quot;did you ever get to buying a lawn mower?&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked at the out of the blue question, but shrugged. It would allow us to pass time while waiting for Molly to return home.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we've borrowed Mr. York's when we've needed to,&quot; I told him, &quot;the part that we cut isn't that big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose it's right up there with the bed on things to buy,&quot; Dave chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eventually,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;though while Mr. York's is working and he's willing to share, I'm not that desperate to buy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave then came over and looked at some of photographs that were on the bookshelf that contained all the books that Molly and I owned... some of them were college textbooks as well. One of them was from our senior prom in high school. We weren't dating then, but neither of us had a formal date, and so we went as a couple. It was then that the idea of dating her really sprung to my mind, though it took awhile to get the courage to actually ask her out. Another was a blown up photo of what had been our first date. I'd taken her to the movies and ran into some of her friends who had their camera phones with them... and thus the photo of me sleeping on Molly's shoulder at a movie I would have never gone to if it wasn't for her. Molly kept it to insure I'd never forget.<br />
<br />
And then there was the third photo. Taken while we had been in college after Molly's transformation. We were standing side by side by a stone &quot;monument&quot; at our college in the graduation gowns they had sold us to wear. Of course Molly's was too small on her, but the gown had been made for a human around 5 foot eight inches at the max. Not a tigress who was easily taller then I was. We were in the shade in the photo, which seemed good, as Molly half looked like she was suffering in the heat. Her paw-like hand rested on my shoulder and held me to her while her tail was low and seemed to go around my ankles to one of her feet. It was a good photo, though part of me wondered if Molly and I ought to have a new one made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say... has Molly had all her... shots?&quot; Dave asked slowly as he looked at the photo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vaccinations?&quot; I asked back, &quot;yeah, apparently after being transformed her parents took her to a vet or something and they gave her the basic shots to protect her from things like Rabies and were then advised to go to a specialist at the zoo that was there... and they gave her the booster shots to protect her from diseases that tigers are at risk for. And from what she later told me, they wanted to dissect her but couldn't because she wouldn't consent to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;that'd have to be the last thing she'd want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; I nodded, &quot;and she didn't tell me about it till much later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had any further contact with Leona or the other victims of that freak show?&quot; Dave wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not since the trial for Leona,&quot; I told him, &quot;and Molly and I never interacted with any of the other victims. Once Changes' freak show was shut down, most of them were free to go their own way. Unfortunately with everything that Molly and I have gone through, I haven't seen any of the news updates that might let us know what happened to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what's happened to Leona?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I know, she's been set up in a lab in Peoria to try and find a cure to what Eugene Changes forced her to create in the first place,&quot; I replied, &quot;and that is all I know. I don't even know if the formula that had been created for the freak show's purpose of making animal-people for its attractions is still around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you and Molly have left all that behind,&quot; Dave commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;that we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave looked around the cabin for a moment or two, or at least the living room area we were in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys have done a good job with the place,&quot; Dave commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Molly's work, mostly,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I'm no good with interior decoration.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, looking out the front window, now behind a television screen, which was thankfully a high definition screened TV as Molly and I don't have cable or satellite providers yet, I saw Molly making her way toward the front door of our cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I believe Molly has returned,&quot; I said to Dave softly, &quot;Come on, I'll introduce you.&quot;<br />
<br />
We quietly approached the entryway and waited for Molly to open the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;George? Do we have a guest?&quot; Molly asked as she opened the door and then saw Dave standing beside me, &quot;I... uh... caught a different scent...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Dave said politely, &quot;can I call you Molly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Molly said looking between me and Dave and then shrugged, &quot;sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly, this is Dave Choir,&quot; I spoke to introduce my friend in Columbia Falls to my girlfriend, &quot;He has done the most out of anyone to help us out. He gave me the charity job at his vineyard and he knew Mr. York and gave him the tip that we needed a place to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched a light of recognition go over Molly's features.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had helped with all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave George a place at my vineyard, yes,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;I can't take the credit for you two getting your home here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still have our thanks,&quot; Molly told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome, then,&quot; Dave said with a smile, &quot;it is a pleasure to meet you, Molly. George has been telling me a lot about you and the course of the last six months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much of it is all that cheerful,&quot; Molly sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not outwardly, but you both have each other,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;and from what I've gathered, you two love each other very much. I hope you're as happy together as Tabby and I are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His wife,&quot; I told her, &quot;anyway, I've asked Dave out here to be a helper for you for the next month or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A month or so?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;where are you going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The station got my application's acceptance letter this morning,&quot; I told her, &quot;so I'll be reporting for training to join the Columbia Falls PD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great!&quot; Molly exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;but it will require me to go to Kalispell for awhile. I've asked Dave to help you with anything you need and provide you with some security in case Beauregard tries something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Molly said with a heavy sigh, &quot;I'm sorry Mr. Choir, it's just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George has explained to me what the guy's been doing,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;and he is a jerk. You have nothing to apologize for. And you'll find we have a few connections already. My daughter is in the summer program that you've been teaching with Mrs. Fitzpatrick and has taken quite a shine to you. Her name is Veronica.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly's eyes brightened, &quot;Oh! I know her, very cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe while George is out you can come visit us,&quot; Dave offered, &quot;I'm sure she'd like to have you over for dinner some night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very kind of you,&quot; Molly told Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the least I can do,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;It's what friends are for.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
That night Molly and I lay quietly on the mattress that was there for us to sleep on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So when do you go for training?&quot; Molly asked as she ran one paw along my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm expected down there in a couple of days,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;I'll miss you, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I'll miss you too, but it's a step forward. We'll have a real future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That we will,&quot; I nodded as we began to drift off to sleep, &quot;that we will...&quot;</p>
