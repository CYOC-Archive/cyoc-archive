<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From my hiding spot, I watched as they drank beer after beer over the next half an hour, their speech becoming more and more slurred as they cheered and jeered the players on TV.  I had spent years trying my hardest to stay out of their way, so spending time watching, observing them was new for me.  I was stuck by how inane their conversation was; this player was a bitch, that player was gay, this guy was the man.  I felt a mix of emotions, glad that I wasn&#39;t that dumb, but sad that I wasn&#39;t part of what they had.  They liked each other, they had an undeniable bond that they did not have with me.  I thought about this for a moment as two more cans of beer were emptied and thrown on the floor joining the pile of others already there.  Competitive as always the two had began a drinking contest, who could drink the most the fastest.  My thoughts were interrupted by a loud belch from Chris.  <br />
<br />
Chris was just over eleven months older than Aaron, our mother basically went from one pregnancy to another. He was two inches or so taller than Aaron but shared the same dark hair and blue eyes that ran in our family.  As the first born, he had a cocky sense of entitlement, everything was just meant for him.  Chris wasn&#39;t use to hearing &#39;no&#39; and didn&#39;t accept it when he did. He was taught from an early age to take what he wanted. The rapidly emptying beer box was evidence of this, Chris walked into the liquor store, 19 years old, and bought it.  Even our father didn&#39;t say no to Chris.  Chris was his pride and joy, a man that men wanted to be and women wanted to be with, even if they didn&#39;t know it yet.  I felt a spike of jealousy and anger at how easy his life had been and how he&#39;d wasted it.  <br />
<br />
I reach out and tip the beer that Chris is drinking back spilling it down onto his shirt and short.  Aaron laughed as Chris swore, too drunk to really question what had just happened.  He said something but it was basically unintelligible. I looked at the pile of empties on the floor, I couldn&#39;t count them all but it was clear they had both drank close to two dozen each in the last hour, in addition to taking pulls right out of a cheap plastic bottle of whisky. I wondered about Chris&#39;s tolerance as I watched him stumble to his feet.  Aaron was still laughing as he slurred out something to the effect of &quot;more laundry for bitch boy.&quot; Chris wasn&#39;t stable standing, swaying and stumbling around as he tried to get his shirt over his head and off failing to accomplish it. A few times, I thought he had seen me as he spun, working at getting the wet shirt off, but his eyes were vacant, he was hammered.  Chris finally had enough and decided to rip the shirt off, grabbing at the neck and pulling down until it tore open, slipping the now destroyed shirt off.  <br />
<br />
I had more than likely seen Chris shirtless before, but I would never have stared the way I was this time. I allowed myself to take it all in.  Chris had the body of an olympic swimmer hard muscles covered by smooth skin. His arms, pecks, and abs were all perfectly sculpted by hours in the gym.  &quot;ohh here&#39;s the big strong man&quot; Aaron teased with a sarcastic slow clap.  Chris smiled and started doing a little dance, flexing his arms and thrusting his hips, clearly pleased with himself as Aaron chuckled.  Feeling emboldened by situation as it stood, I used my power to quickly and smoothly undo the button on Chris&#39;s shorts and pull down the zipper.  The shorts were now loose around his waste.  Chris didn&#39;t notice until they had worked their way down to his knees exposing his boxers.  Chris looked a little confused, but didn&#39;t really seem to mind his shorts had just fallen down. He kicked them off leaving him in a pair of baggy blue boxers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you wear those ugly things?&quot; Aaron blurted out pointing at Chris&#39;s boxers, &quot;you got to switch to briefs, women love them.&quot;  Chris looked down at his underwear, before he very matter a factly stated &quot;because my dick is too big for briefs&quot; as if it was obvious to everyone. This made Aaron laugh even more, Chris, however, was not amused. Chris grabbed the band of boxers with both hands and pulled them down.  I had thought Aaron had a big penis, but Chris&#39;s was even bigger.  It looked almost absurd resting there, limp between his legs stretching down a good 10 inches long and thicker than a baseball bat. His pubic hair was perfectly trimmed to clean neat patch.  &quot;Jealous?&quot; Chris slurred, &quot;dont you forget who the man of the house is.&quot;  Aaron looked down at the floor, embarrassed by and submissive to his big brother. Chris took a few steps closer to a still sitting Aaron, &quot;come on give it a little kiss&quot; he said with a laugh.  While Chris was distracted laughing and Aaron was still looking down and away, I reached forward and gave Chris&#39;s baseball sized nuts a hard squeeze.  <br />
<br />
&quot;OOWWWWW&quot; Chris roared, &quot;GAY!&quot; Aaron was confused by this turn in events and even more confused when Chris balled his fist and punched him in the face.  Aaron didn&#39;t know what started the fight but he wasn&#39;t going to just roll over.  He pushed off the couch and tackled Chris.  The two wrestled around on the floor scattering the empty beer cans all over the room.  I smiled at how easy it was to make this happen.  I decided to give Aaron a little help and gave Chris a few mental punches to the stomach, knocking the wind out of him and letting Aaron get the upper hand.  Aaron pinned Chris down on his back using his knees and hands to lock his arms and fists against the floor. Aaron&#39;s hips were splayed open with his meaty cock just inches from a gasping Chris&#39;s face.  Chris struggled in vain to free himself of Aaron but could not move him.  &quot;Who&#39;s the man of the house now?&quot; Aaron asked with a snarl.</p>
