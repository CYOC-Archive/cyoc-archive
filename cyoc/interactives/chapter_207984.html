<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How can this day get any worse?&quot; Nathan thought to himself as a bell rung and people around him started talked in loud voices and got up.<br />
<br />
What felt like days ago, but was actually hours earlier, he&#39;d been at a department store where he&#39;d bought three outfits, one of them he now had on, and had been searching for his former fiancé. When it became clear that he wasn&#39;t going to find her anywhere, he returned to the front of store, where he realised what Jodie had, and what it meant for him. Feeling like he was close to panicking, he&#39;d been unable to help himself as he let his tongue loll out as the sobering fact that if he could find her, he was trapped like he was, condemned to become a bitch. Not wanting this, he forced himself to take several deep breaths as he scanned the crowd and when he felt like he was starting to calm down, he headed towards the customer service.<br />
<br />
After he&#39;d had them page Jodie twice, he inquired if he might leave a message. Aware that his voice had shifted, that it had begun to lighten, take on the pitch of a girl&#39;s, Nathan tried to ignore this as said, &quot;If someone asks for a Nathan to be paged, could you tell them I left and have gone to grandmama Patricija Lara&#39;s place and I&#39;ll meet them there,&quot; and getting an okay from the clerk, he&#39;d taken one last look at the various people before he left the store.<br />
<br />
With an intention to head straight for Jodie&#39;s grandmama&#39;s house, he wondered if Jodie already gone ahead, then asked himself why she would have. Finding he had no answer, he watched as a city bus approached, considered taking it, but changed his mind when he smelled the reek of the thing before it had even turned into the parking lot. Believing he was better off walking, he adjusted his backpack and turned in the direction he needed to go. Hurrying away from the store, he looked both ways before he dashed across the street and started to his next destination in a leisurely pace. Finding it was a nice day, and there was so many things to hear and smell, Nathan found he wasn&#39;t in too much of hurry, despite that he knew he should get where he was going as fast as he could and find the book that he hoped would explain why he was unable to transform back.<br />
<br />
Thoughts drifted as he walked and after some time, they settled on what he had on. He found he didn&#39;t want to admit it aloud, but the clothes were actually really comfortable. The skirt brushed his bare legs in just the right way, allowed for decent amount of movement, and kept his tail pinned just so that it could still move, but it was unable to lift up too far. His top wasn&#39;t too tight, nor to loose, and the fabric it was made of, a soft, high thread count cotton, brushed up against his four extra nipples in such a way that it was almost a turn on, whilst at the same time giving his pert B cup breasts a nice, rounded and full look. And the boots, they didn&#39;t rub, or pinch, or doing anything that would make them uncomfortable, leaving him with the feeling he&#39;d made a good choice in purchasing them.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to how his feet were morphing, he breathed deep and thought, &quot;This day is actually starting to look up. Sure, I&#39;m turning into a bitch, I&#39;m wearing girl&#39;s clothes, but soon I&#39;ll get to grandmama Patricija Lara&#39;s place, find the book on magical artefacts, get the Amulet of Zulo, and be able to put this whole incident behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then the world came crashing down around him as from behind he heard first a car horn, then the whoop of a siren. Turning to look in the direction of the noise, sure it couldn&#39;t have anything to do with him, he was dismayed when a patrol car, marked &quot;Truancy Officer&quot; on the door, pulled up alongside him. Watching as the window rolled down, Nathan was unsure why they wanted to stop him as a female cop inside the car asked, &quot;Where are you heading?&quot;<br />
<br />
The decision to lie never crossed his mind, and Nathan folded his arms across his chest as he took a stance that, if he saw it, he&#39;d find looked exactly like one Jodie took when she was on guard about something. And as he did this, he stated, &quot;Going to meet a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they at school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren&#39;t you at school right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, it never occurred to Nathan to lie and with so much as batting an eye, he started to respond, &quot;Because...&quot; but trailed off as realised the cop he was talking to suspected him of being truant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have an id on you?&quot; the woman asked and Nathan, feeling like kicking himself for not taking his driver&#39;s licence out of his wallet, shook his head as he realised at some point he&#39;d set down Jodie&#39;s purse, but had forgotten to take it with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Once more, without a second thought to what he said, Nathan automatically said, &quot;Nicole Staci.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious to know why he&#39;d told the cop this, he watched as she typed at a computer mounted to the passenger dash panel. After a moment, the cop looked over at him and explained, &quot;Nicole, it&#39;s says here you have been marked truant, that the school has tried to contact your parents but they havent answere, and nodding to seat next to her, the cop said, &quot;Tell you what. Why don&#39;t you hop in and I&#39;ll give you a ride to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought that he should run crossed his mind, but he found he found himself frozen in place. Confused, troubled, and host of other emotions washed over him, he thought about what he should do for a moment before he reached down and got into the car. Pulling the door closed, he reached for the seatbelt as the cop stated, &quot;I&#39;m Officer Angela,&quot; before she put the car into drive. Pulling away from the curb, she explained, &quot;You might not see any importance in going to school any longer, but you really should finish. A girl your age needs to have that degree that says she completed, which will help later in life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say, Nathan nodded as the rest of ride passed with him getting a lecture on the merits of staying school, why skiving wasn&#39;t a good idea, that Officer Angela didn&#39;t want to know about the friend Nathan was going to see, and that she&#39;d let him off this once with a warning. Soon finding himself escorted out of the patrol car and into the senior high he&#39;d attended about nine years prior, he didn&#39;t have a chance to blink before he found himself in the principal&#39;s office. There, he&#39;d been given another talking to, as well as three weekend detentions, and after being given his class schedule, which he&#39;d explained he&#39;d forgotten, he was sent off to class. Finding this intolerable, as everyone seemed to believe he was Nicole Staci, Nathan found it seemed to get worse as he was expected to act like a high school girl. Struggling to get through the day, he found PE to be the worst, as it meant he had to change in front of a bunch of girls he saw as younger than him, yet, weirdly enough, he was now the same age as. In addition, he found it odd that none of them said anything about his tail, teats, the fur coat he was growing, or the fact that he had canine paws for feet, which upset him badly the moment he learned of them.<br />
<br />
Somehow in the end making it through the day, he was both thankful it was over, yet, at the same time he wondered how it could get any worse. Certain that it could, he listened to the other students as they talked loudly amongst themselves as they left. Waiting until most of them had left, Nathan stood and followed at the back, but stopped when the teacher, Mr Ryerstein, told him, &quot;Make sure you do the homework assignment, Ms Staci. And try not to forget your notebooks and pencil tomorrow, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the same message he&#39;d gotten from all the other teachers, and Nathan mentally sighed as he responded the same way, &quot;Okay,&quot; and, &quot;Sorry about that. I&#39;ve been having an off day,&quot; before he exited the classroom.<br />
<br />
Backpack shouldered, he pushed his way through the thick crowd of students and tried not to hurry as he headed for the nearest exit. Finding he was glad that nobody called out to him as he went, he speculated on why that might be, and decided that it could be because his transformation might have turned him so far into a seventeen year old girl, but the ultimate outcome would be a four-legged bitch. Depressed by the fact that he seemed to have no friends at school, Nathan thought, &quot;Forget it. Get to Jodie&#39;s grandmama&#39;s house, find her, the book, and figure out why and how to turn back,&quot; as he left the school.<br />
<br />
Sure that&#39;d he&#39;d be stopped again, though unsure why, he was on guard the whole way to his destination. Arriving there almost fifty minutes after school had let out, he breathed a sigh of relief before he wondered if he should knock or go right in. Deciding on both, he first knocked on the door, then pushed it open, calling out, &quot;Hello? Jodie? as he did.<br />
<br />
Getting no answer, he cocked his head and entered the house. Calling out again as he set his pack next to the door, he found it troubling that the house was empty. Wandering through the rooms on the first floor, finding everything as Jodie had left it when they&#39;d left yesterday, Nathan was perplexed on why it seemed like Jodie hadn&#39;t even been there. Finding no note or any other indication she&#39;d come and left, he hoped something hadn&#39;t happened to her, toyed with the idea that maybe she had also been picked up by a truant officer and hauled to school as he headed toward the library and began to scan the book titles.<br />
<br />
The book located after a few seconds, Nathan flipped it open and paged through it until he found the section dedicated to the Amulet of Zulo. Carefully reading everything printed, hoping that Jodie would turn up soon, he stopped when he read about some of the restrictions. Going back, he read the paragraphs a second time, a third time, and with a whimper, began to read it a fourth it a fourth, but dropped the book before he&#39;d even finished. Feeling like he was in a state of shock, he didn&#39;t even hear it as the book fell to the hardwood floor as he stumbled across the room and out the door. Making his way upstairs, it took him a couple tries before he found a room that had a full-body mirror inside. Seeing it had been Patricija Lara&#39;s bedroom at one time, he ignored everything about it as he stepped in front of the mirror and peered at his reflection.<br />
<br />
His familiar face, though kind of younger looking, peered back at him, along with same short hair he always had. But from the neck down, the image he saw was that of a seventeen year old girl wearing a short-sleeve top and a peasant skirt with daisies and polka dots printed on it. Thinking on how he&#39;d put it on after PE, he absently kicked off his boots, ignored his feet, and giving it a bit of thought, proceeded to shuck off the skirt. Putting it on the nearby bed, he took off the shirt he had on and left it next to the first garment before he stepped back in front of the mirror. Wearing only the pinkish-white bra and thong, he stared at the floral pattern a moment before he tore his eyes away and looked at his body from the neck down. Seeing the fur that had begun to cover him had spread, and that black spots had started to form, he reach back behind and with trembling hands, unclasped the bra hooks in the back. Tossing it and the underwear after he&#39;d taken it off onto the bed, he peered at the naked person in the mirror, taking in how the fur now covered his crotch and more of his upper legs, he lifted a leg, noted that his canine vulva still remained bare, dropped his leg, wondered what black spots had started to develop before he focused on the reason he&#39;d come upstairs.<br />
<br />
Not sure what exactly he was looking for, Nathan turned one way, then another. After doing this a couple times, and watching as his tail wagged back and forth, he stopped and ran a finger over each erect nipple. Shivering at the soft touch and how it left him with a sensation he was only able to describe as an arousal, he traced the finger across his abdomen. Bring his other hand up, he touched his forefingers and thumbs together so that they made a kind of circle and held them against his belly. His navel in the exact centre of the ring he&#39;d made, he shuddered as he imaged what was going on inside his body and after a moment, feeling like he had to admit the truth, he whimpered out, &quot;I&#39;m pregnant. That&#39;s why I cannot use the Amulet of Zulo to change back.&quot;</p>
