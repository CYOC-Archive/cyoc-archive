<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just outside the bathroom, Josh&#39;s mother had come to check on him, &quot;honey? You okay innthere?&quot; She asked with concern. Unfortunately for Josh that only brought an image of her face inside his perverted little mind, suddenly the sliver ring began to shimmer causing Josh to stop jacking off, &quot;huh?&quot; He said in confusion. However soon after he began to feel dizzy and it began to be too hard to focus on anything, even his on feet and he soon fell right on his was on the hard bathtub, knocking himself unconscious . <br />
<br />
When he awoke he found himself staring at the bathroom door but on the outside this time, hang on he wasn&#39;t this tall and why did his chest feel so heavy? &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; He gasped as he looked down to see a set of tits barely being contained by a black bra and a dark grey blouse. &quot; M-my voice! I sound like mom! &quot; recognized as he put one of his hands up to feel his throat, there be felt tiny jewels that his father had gotten his mother for their wedding anniversary the other day. He continued to look at his new brown hair and to look down (past his new mountainous chest) to see his mother&#39;s jeans and her favorite pair of sandals, &quot;damn! Mom really does have a nice ass&quot; Josh admired as he felt his new ads with his right hand. Speaking of hands , he looked at them too closely admiring the strange appendages that looked slightly bony with age but still admirably nice looking, he also saw his mother&#39;s wedding ring, her anniversary ring that his father had gotten her two years prior and....the silver ring!<br />
<br />
He closely examined it, it was definitely the same ring he had found in the shower, but how could it be on his mother&#39;s ring finger now? And more importantly, how was he his own mother right now? He would have to find out later since now he needed to stop staring at himself in the upstairs hallway in front of the bathroom door. Josh started to walk back downstairs where hopefully things would begin to make some sense again, maybe this was all a dream? Yeah he slipped and fell in the shower and now he was dreaming! With that thought in mind, he began to smile &quot;might as well make the the most of this weird dream&quot; he thought to himself as he reached the downstairs hallway where he saw his little brother and older sister playing connectfour on the ground<br />
<br />
Samantha: older sister, 19 years of age, likes James but not Josh for whatever reason (probably cause you always messed with her a lot when you were growing up), mostly like to hang out with her friends.<br />
<br />
James: youngest brother, 7 years of age, favorite activity is drawing and likes Samantha and Josh equally, he hopes his Dad will take him to the art museum this saturday.<br />
<br />
 he walks past them as they say, &quot;hey mom&quot; which causes shivers to crawl down his spine, he walks into the living room where he sees hisdad watching the latest football game.<br />
<br />
Harold: father, 47 years of age, loves his family but also loves sports sometimes he chooses one over the other,  doesn&#39;t quite understand his boys but (surprisingly) understood his daughter very well.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hey honey, any luck getting Josh outta the shower?&quot; He asks half paying attention to the game and half paying attention to his &#39; wife&#39;. &quot;Uhh well...&quot; he begins but Harold just as quickly says, &quot; uh huh, good job honey&quot; and continues watching the game. Josh gives up on trying to live out this dream in the living room so he heads back upstairs where he notices the bathroom door now open. &quot;Hm maybe I should investigate&quot; he says as he walks inside to find nobody in there but a wet towel and some white shampoo splattered across the shower curtains, or at least he hopes that&#39;s shampoo. He closes the door as he leaves and looks over to his room, the door is open, &quot;maybe uh someone is in there?&quot; He says trying to understand what was going on and he begins to walk over to it and gently push open the door to see his old body butt nacked masturbating!<br />
<br />
 &quot;What the hell!&quot; Josh shouts in his mother&#39;s voice, thankfully his father&#39;s football game is loud enough to block your outburst. Josh&#39;s body spins around in surprise, &quot; oh hello Josh, I was wondering where you scampered off to&quot; it says, &quot;w-who are you&quot; Josh stutters. &quot;Well right now I&#39;m that ring on your finger right now manually possessing your body, but really I&#39;m your mother inhabiting your body&quot; it expalins, &quot;sorry?&quot; Josh says surprised by the answer &quot; let me better explain, you see I&#39;m a magical body swapping ring, I was created about 10,000 years ago by a magician and a blacksmith, let&#39;s just say they had some fun but after their &quot;fun&quot; they somehow lost me and soon enough I developed my own want for use and so I used some of my magic to magically transport myself to random people whenever I want&quot; he looks dumbfounded at his very nacked body and sit down on your chair, &quot;so your telling me this isn&#39;t a dream?&quot; He asks his body or &quot; the ring&quot; for the time being.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Nope, this is all real, let me explain the rules for you okay?&quot; He nods his head and it begins &quot;well first all you have to do is think of a specific person and I&#39;ll swap you both with my magic-pretty standard rule hard to not understand if I say so myself&quot; he feels as if he should be writing this down. &quot;Second, use me on anyone and for anything, I won&#39;t be upset, I like it when things get weird&quot; that he wasn&#39;t too sure on, but then he thought of all the women he could potentially become , that may or may not brought a smile to his face, &quot;third, I can brainwash people into behaving like the body they&#39;re in so as to not rouse suspicion of I can make them completely aware of who they are, personally I like to see their reactions&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot; Fianlly, if you are ever in a need of guidance just say, &#39;ring of sliver, I call upon you today to guide me&#39; there is no rhyme, my creators weren&#39;t exactly THAT creative, what that means is I will either possess someone around you to give you advice or (if you want) will possess you to get you out of a sticky situation&quot; it finishes. Josh thinks on this and says, &quot;so once your done possessing my body, my mom will be in full control of it?&quot; It nods and says, &quot; yeah, she&#39;ll probably be pretty weirded out too, you want me to brainwash her into thinking she&#39;s you? &quot;It asks. Josh thinks upon it and says &quot;I&#39;ll figure it out when you leave&quot; it shrugs and says &quot;alright, well can&#39;t wait to see how you use me Josh, see ya&quot; and Josh sees a silver glint leave his body and suddenly a look of confusion appears on his face. &quot;Uh why am I naked? What the heck?! I&#39;m staring at my body&quot; his Mother says as she looks at you, time to make a choice.</p>
