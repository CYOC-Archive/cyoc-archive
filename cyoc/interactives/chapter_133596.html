<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle spent some more time wandering around town as a dog, getting used to how different the world was through his new senses. He noticed he barely paid attention to how things looked anymore. Sure, it was nice to see that he wasn&#39;t about to bump into something, but he smelled and heard most things long before they had chance to come into view anyway. His tail took some getting used to, but eventually he started taking for granted that it would wag whenever he got excited, sway behind him as he walked, and dip between his legs if he was startled or anxious. It was as natural as smiling or frowning. Kyle also got used to the fact that humans just saw him as a dog now. He no longer cared if they saw him lift his leg and mark a tree or a lamp-post. It was just a fact of life now.<br />
<br />
Turning a corner, Kyle saw one of the other dogs he had heard barking at him about half an hour earlier. She wagged her tail enthusiastically: she seemed very happy to see him. She was tied up in a yard and he could tell she wanted him to come over. Her scent was everywhere around here--he was definitely on her turf, but oddly she didn&#39;t seem bothered by that just now. Oh well, might as well go over and check things out.<br />
<br />
The word &quot;hello&quot; didn&#39;t even enter Kyle&#39;s mind. He had no use for words anymore--a limited and inefficient form of communication at best. Smells were much more interesting. Sniffing her butt just came naturally to Kyle. She also sniffed his. He also noticed she was sniffing his groin for some reason. He sniffed harder... there was a certain smell there... he didn&#39;t consciously recognize it, but was demanding his full attention.<br />
<br />
Then she stopped and turned her butt up in the air, wagging her tail. The full force of the scent hit him, and he realized what he was feeling. His arousal coursed through his body as he felt the erection begin. He knew what she wanted, and he suddenly felt very important.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second!&quot; thought Kyle. &quot;I can&#39;t just ... do this ... right here in the middle of someone&#39;s yard ... can I ?&quot;<br />
<br />
But of course he could. No one would see anything but two dogs acting like two dogs. So after agonizing in his mind for a few seconds, he gave in. He jumped on her back and the feelings from their connected parts washed over Kyle with the force of several tsunamis. In that moment, Kyle didn&#39;t care about anything but the waves of ecstacy coming from down there. He squeezed his mate with front legs and rammed himself deeper into her using his back legs. Then his body tensed up, and he felt a powerful release flow out of him and into her. He gripped her tight, then relaxed, panting, and let himself back down off of her. He was very surprised that he could actually pull his penis back out of his partner. They were stuck there, tail to tail! He yelped, startled, then calmed down. A new instinct told him that it would all be alright, he just had to wait there and let nature its course. So he waited, enjoying the aftershocks of his orgasm, feeling very proud of himself, that he, Kyle Perkins, had played his part in fathering the next generation of puppies to come into the world.<br />
<br />
Then a very different feeling washed over him as he had time to think about what he had just done. Jennifer&#39;s words rang in his head again: &quot;Funny you should call me a bitch Kyle, because that&#39;s the only thing you&#39;ll have sex with as a dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it had actually happened. After all those health classes in school being told not to have sex because he might get a girl pregnant, here he was now, nothing but an animal who couldn&#39;t resist fucking another animal in heat. He always thought he might actually want kids someday, but he never thought that would mean siring a litter of puppies out in a neighbor&#39;s yard somewhere.<br />
<br />
Finally, whatever was holding his dick in his bitch faded, and Kyle left with his tail hanging low.</p>
