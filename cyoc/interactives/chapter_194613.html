<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Theresa walked down the streets of the polar resort after getting a train back from Santa&#39;s village, taking in all the sights and sounds of the tourists as they enjoyed their vacations. The longer their vacations went on, the more of them decided to try out a new form, so the streets were filled with skipping werefox kits, lumbering werebears hauling armfuls of Christmas presents, and even a few members of the more esoteric tribes like the werelynx, selkies, and a few werelemmings. <br />
<br />
Everyone was enjoying the aurora hanging over the resort, casting its bright light over the perpetual nighttime. Everyone, that is, except for Mrs. Laine. She was still reeling from her talk earlier with Eric and Michael, where they’d both stood up for their choices and made her feel like a fool for just trying to cling to a little bit of normality. Did she have any problems with anyone here at the North Pole? No, not except for Michael, and even that animosity was beginning to fade. Every single person here at the resort had treated her with respect, kindness, and generosity, and still she kept on persisting that Eric and Tom were making a mistake in staying here. <br />
<br />
Was she jealous? That her sons had found a place that offered just as much that she had, and perhaps even more? Hell, even Eric seemed to be siding more with Michael than with his own mother. <br />
<br />
And Theresa knew she had been asking for it. She flew up here because she had the tiniest inkling that something was wrong with Tom, ready to drag her grown sons back home. She was suffocating them, and she knew it, but it was the only way of being a parent that she’d ever known since Michael had left. No wonder Tom had left home and immediately began globetrotting, to make up for the lack of freedom he’d felt throughout his entire childhood. <br />
<br />
“Ah, Mrs. Laine! Happy holidays!” a friendly voice said from right behind Theresa, full of cheer and energy. She turned and came face-to-face with Lars, his whiskered black nose less than a foot from her face. <br />
<br />
“L-Lars! Of course, happy holidays to you,” she stammered, taking a few steps back from the werefox and composing herself. To be honest, she had been avoiding Lars (and, by extension, Tom), still having a hard time dealing with these magical creatures up close. However, the more she spent around Bix’s home, with reindeer and werewolf doctors popping in and out at all hours of the day, she was starting to get far more comfortable with these non-human people. <br />
<br />
Lars looked at Theresa with amusement, seemingly sensing her discomfort. “Perhaps you’d prefer this, <i>rouva</i>?”, he said playfully, and with a quick shimmer he assumed his human form, his blue eyes and platinum blond hair sparkling in the aurora overhead. “Ta-daa~! Not too bad, <i>ei</i>? Though Tommy, he still says I am more beautiful in my fox form.” <br />
<br />
“H-he does? But, you look so handsome like that!” Theresa suddenly gushed, wondering how her son could possibly prefer an animal to an attractive human man. However, the more she compared Lar’s different forms, the more she found an odd, exotic attractiveness in his werefox form that was lacking in his human form. Honestly, it was the same for the rest of the magical creatures living at the North Pole; their human forms were very attractive by human standards, but nothing she hadn’t seen a hundred times before in her lifetime. Their animal forms, on the other hand... <br />
<br />
“Oh, <i>anoppi</i>, that is so kind for you to say!” Lars exclaimed, rushing in and pulling Theresa into a loving hug. “I like humans quite a lot, so I put much work into making my human form look so good. As one of the faces of the resort, it is a must to look one’s best, <i>ei</i>?” <br />
<br />
“<i>Ei</i>? Umm, yes I suppose so,” Theresa replied shyly. Between Bix, Tag, and Lars, Eric and Tom had certainly found some unusual families to join, and she had no idea whether or not this level of energy was usual for Lars or if he was going out of his way to make her feel welcome. “So, how is Tom? I haven’t seen much of him lately...” <br />
<br />
“How is he? Worried about his brother, I think!” Lars sighed, his tail whipping back and forth as he waved his hand dismissively. “Forget Tommy, how is Eric?” <br />
<br />
Theresa and Lars found a warm place to talk, and she explained how Eric had fully regained consciousness and was on the mend. Lars’ own aurora began to glitter and sparkle with joy hearing that, drawing attention from some of the nearby tourists at his display. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Tommy will be so happy to hear that! He is always complaining, saying he wants to visit more often. But I say let the doctor handle this and stay out of his way!” <br />
<br />
“R-right, I’m very grateful for Otso... Doctor Otso, I mean. He is a very hard-working man,” Theresa replied with a tiny grimace, well aware by now of the relationship that had been blossoming between her ex-husband and the werewolf doc. <br />
<br />
“So, if Eric is conscious, what are you doing here?” Lars asked pointedly. “Bix, he has a big home, so I’m sure there is room for everyone, <i>ei</i>?” <br />
<br />
“I... God, I don’t even know what I’m doing here...” Theresa groaned, slumping down in a chair. Lars could tell he had struck a nerve without even thinking, so he quickly moved in to try cheer up his <i>anoppi</i>. <br />
<br />
“Ah, I know what! When someone is recovering, they need a treat to raise their spirits, right? That is why you are here, right?” Lars exclaimed. “Lucky for you, I can help you with this!” <br />
<br />
He pulled out a notebook from his pocket and rattled off a list of activities available for guests to enjoy at the resort. “Let me see, you can cook Eric some Christmas cookies, mix up some mulled wine, make some gingerbread... Make your choice, <i>rouva</i>!” he said happily, now in his full-on PR rep mode. <br />
<br />
“I’m not so sure I-” <br />
<br />
“<i>Hölynpöly</i>! If you cannot decide, then I shall! Christmas cookies it is!” Lars said, taking Theresa by the hand gently leading her away toward the evening of fun he had decided on for them. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
At Otso’s home, Michael continued to press himself deeper and deeper into the wolf’s fur under the blankets, breathing in the peculiar mix of musk and expensive soap that had seeped into the doctor’s fur. The smell was hot and humid, sticking to the back of Michael’s nose and driving him positively wild. <br />
<br />
“You smell... very nice, doctor,” Michael sighed, pressing his nose deeper to inhale the strong scent right at the source. <br />
<br />
“Is that so? Not a very human reaction to smell...” Otso replied clinically with a wry grin on his face. “Perhaps your senses are being affected by the change, too? Getting a more canine sense of smell and reaction to pheromones?” <br />
<br />
“Whatever it is, I want more,” Michael said flatly, continuing to sniff and press himself against every inch of Otso’s skin he could. Amused, the doctor responded in kind, pushing his cold nose against Michael’s sensitive skin, and together the two let one another’s pheromones drive them into a heady arousal. <br />
<br />
Before long, Otso leaned forward and pulled Michael into a deep kiss, his long wolf tongue sloppily slipping between Michael’s lips and twisting around, each of them tasting wine and delicious curry on one another’s breath. Michael felt his new paws twitching under the blankets and his tail thumping against the backs of his legs at the excitement of the sudden kiss, and he let Otso pull him closer against himself. The constant contact between their bodies was driving them both positively wild, and their cocks began to stiffen and rub against each other, just as they had the last time the two men had been in this position. <br />
<br />
But this time, just a little friendly rubbing wasn’t going to be enough for either of them. <br />
<br />
Within moments, Michael turned Otso around on the couch, while the wolf playfully teasing his swelling knot and drooling red cock. <br />
<br />
“I always wondered why you don’t like wearing pants, doctor,” Michael teased as he walked over and let himself fall on top of the lustful wolf. “Is it because you always want to be ready to go?” <br />
<br />
Otso chuckled at the joke, enjoying seeing Michael taking the initiative. Without a word, the werewolf lifted his bottom into the air and let his tail move to the side, exposing his furry tailhole and giving Michael a wink that told him everything he needed to know. <br />
<br />
Just as wordlessly, Michael grinned and placed the tip of his cock against Otso asshole, teasingly slipping it in and out the tiniest bit to get the good doctor even hornier. Tiny spurts of precum were already dripping down the werewolf’s pointed cock, and once Michael had had his fun he went all the way in, eliciting a quiet grunt from his sexual partner as Michael’s cock completely hilted itself insde him. <br />
<br />
“You... You really haven’t done this before...?” Otso panted, his usually calm demeanor beginning to deteriorate as the lovemaking continued. <br />
<br />
“Seen a little bit of porn... I guess I’m just a natural...” Michael grunted as he pounded back and forth into Otso, hoping that the wolf’s prized microsuede couch cushions wouldn’t be too damaged by the end of the night. In and out, Michael felt himself getting closer and closer to cumming, but every he knew better than to just blow his load without letting Otso have a little fun as well, so he alternated between quick and slow to really keep the doctor guessing. <br />
<br />
Just as he felt himself getting close to his orgasm again, Otso’s eyes flew open and he let out a loud, growling, whine. Hell, it was easily the loudest noise Michael had ever heard the soft-spoken doctor make. <br />
<br />
“T-tight... so fucking tight...” Otso panted, with pure ecstacy painted on his face. Michael was completely confused by what was going on, but he nonetheless let his own orgasm wash over him, blasting thick ropes of cum deep into Otso’s insides while the wolf sprayed like a hose against the ground. They both collapsed upon one another in their exhaustion, with Michael panting and Otso still quietly growling in pleasure. <br />
<br />
Michael began to try to pull himself out, but Otso let out another quiet whine and Michael felt something keeping him securely lodged inside the wolf’s ass. He looked down and saw a patch of grey and brown fur covering his groin and inner thighs, not to mention a thick, red, and swollen lump at the base of his cock, firmly planted inside Otso and keeping them from separating. <br />
<br />
“...A-a knot...” Otso observed dreamily, though he beginning to sound a bit more like his usual self now that the afterglow of their shared orgasm had faded. “Hmm, that will be in there for quite a while, so let’s enjoy one another’s company a bit longer, shall we?” <br />
<br />
Hearing that, Michael nodded and wrapped his arms around Otso’s soft, furry body, though he was a bit annoyed that he had left their bottle of wine all the way on the other end of the room and would not be able to enjoy it until much later...</p>
