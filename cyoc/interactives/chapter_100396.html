<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Late as usual&quot; Daniels said as Helen walked into the board room at exactly 12:30 and twenty seven seconds according to the large clock that hung over the door. &quot;If you women spent half as much time focusing on your work as you did messing around with make-up and gossiping maybe you&#39;d actually be useful&quot;.<br />
<br />
Helen let the comment slide and too her place at the table, making specific note of the fact that over half of the other managers hadn&#39;t shown up yet either. As the rest trickled in Daniels spent the minutes alternating between glaring at each tardy manager in turn and leering at Helens cleavage. Clearly he&#39;d expected her to act self conscious and uncomfortable under his gaze since the old man became visibly frustrated when Helen simply flashed him a sarcastic smile and fished a fancy looking gold pen out of her handbag. Having failed in his standard intimidation tactic Daniels fell back on attempts to belittle her. &quot;Now that we&#39;re finally all here, how about out lovely latest addition to the managerial staff gets her pretty little ass over her and pours out the coffee while we start&quot;.<br />
<br />
There where one or two chuckles among the group of overwhelmingly male managers and many eyes on her as Helen let the comment wash over her. She&#39;d never been a perpetrator of any kind of harassment as her old self, but she&#39;d never appreciated what it was to be an outsider in a man&#39;s domain until she stopped being one. This was an epiphany she decided would be incredibly unfair to keep to herself and picked up her pen and note pad as she walked over to the coffee table with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Confident he&#39;d now put the upstart girl in her place Daniels made a mental note to find out who she&#39;d fucked to get that promotion and make an example of him. Just look at the way she flaunted her body; not a single pair of eyes at the table was on his PowerPoint presentation as she minced her way over to the table behind him. A distraction like that was as unwelcome to him in such an important meeting as a cat would be at a mouse convention and as easy on the eyes as she was as soon as he had the paperwork in front of him he&#39;d make sure she was busted back down to the secretary desk a little slut like her belonged behind.<br />
<br />
Knowing exactly what it was a man like Daniels thought she should be doing Helen knew just where to send him to learn his lesson. As she waited for the kettle to boil she wrote out a fitting form for his new role. Daniels began his speech about how he&#39;d singlehandedly negotiated a historic deal between himself and the CEO of one of the largest suppliers in the area, conveniently glossing over his underlings contributions to the agreement and grossly over stated the benefits it would bring the company. As he droned on no-one seemed to notice his suit beginning to get far too big for him as the balding old man shrank into his chair. Helen grinned as she watched his chest start to grow; he flabby man boobs quickly rounding out and gaining mass as they became undeniably female and didn&#39;t stop inflating until they were much larger than her own with his shirt straining to contain them. The fleshy watermelons where perfectly round and clearly the work of a skilled surgeon; as big as they where Helen planted a desire for an even bigger pair in Daniels mind although once the changes where done he&#39;d have to save his much reduced salary for quite a while before he&#39;d be able to afford the next size up. <br />
<br />
Next Daniels face morphed into that of a pretty early twenties girl as the years dropped off the rest of his body. To complement his huge fake tits heavy make-up plastered itself over him, especially to his plumped up lips that would have looked very much at home wrapped around a cock; it all bonded permanently, no amount of baby wipes would ever have him showing his naked cheeks again. Helen hoped he&#39;d grow to like that particular shade of ruby red as his mouth would be sporting it for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
The few wisps of hair that remained on his head started expanding and soon Daniels was the proud owner of luscious long golden blonde locks that perfectly framed his new face and fell just long enough to brush over the tops of his massive tits. His skin smoothed out and a lifetime of collected imperfections removed themselves leaving behind a healthy glow to his shrunken down body. To complete his exaggerated hourglass figure Daniels&#39; hips expanded outward and his butt inflated significantly; he&#39;d been wide before, but along with a waspish waist his new body extended much farther outward than most people would imagine possible. His voice shot up from the low baritone he normally sported to a much higher pitch as his cock was pulled inside and a fresh new vagina formed to take its place.<br />
<br />
Helen nodded happily as her handy work took shape; Daniels was now the spitting image of the sexy flirtatious secretary she assumed every office woman to be, although she was in desperate need of some new clothes and Helen was all too happy to oblige. The straining and far too large suit shrank down significantly and the material shifted until it was a tight grey latex blouse that clung to Daniels&#39;s every curve and showed off far more of her tits than would&#39;ve been regulation if anyone had the mind to challenge her on it. To go with it the former trousers became a matching tiny latex miniskirt that only just avoided showing off the pink thong that hid beneath it and the shoes became a pair of towering black high heels.<br />
<br />
As Daniels finally brought her speech to a close something snapped in her mind and she was able to see what she&#39;d become. The little sexpot would&#39;ve cried out in shock if she wasn&#39;t compelled to be the quite little thing her old self believed women should be; now she was only capable of speaking when invited to by one of her betters or if she had something important to deliver. Standing up and stepping back from the table Scarlett, as she now knew she&#39;d been renamed, made her way over to the coffee table and caught sight of her boss Miss Helen. Immediately she knew who&#39;d inflicted these changes on her, but as much as she wanted to be furious she knew she&#39;d never be able to so much as raise a protest let alone actually go so far as do something about her predicament. She picked up the pot of freshly made coffee and as Helen retook her seat Scarlett went around the table filling everyone&#39;s cups. She knew all eyes were on her as she moved and found that she loved being the centre of attention; she loved the way her enormous plastic tits bounced as she walked and the way that movement ensured every man in the room would be focusing solely on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Scarlett&quot; Helen said as her secretary finished her circuit of the table. &quot;You may go now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Scarlett nodded and put down the pot in its proper place before hastily backing out of the room and making her way back to her desk. Helen watched every other head in the room turn as she left and smirked to herself as she thought about the other little present she&#39;d given her newest employee. Scarlett may now love people staring at her tits, but it wouldn&#39;t be long before someone decided that the rule of keeping your hands to yourself didn&#39;t apply to them; as such Helen had left her with something of a defence. If anyone tried groping her they&#39;d trigger spontaneous lactation in Scarlett and the offender would be compelled to drink from her; Scarlett herself would find this an overwhelmingly pleasurable and desirable experience and the drinker would soon find themselves in a similarly sexy and exaggeratedly feminine body; the more they harassed the more they&#39;d be made to drink and the longer they drank the smaller and bustier they would become. <br />
<br />
Helen giggled to herself at the thought of it and couldn&#39;t wait to catch someone in the act. She wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if half of the male population of the office found themselves on the other side of the gender divide within the week. With Scarlett&#39;s old self gone one of the other senior managers stepped up to lead the meeting and Helen&#39;s mind wandered as she considered her next move with the pen.</p>
