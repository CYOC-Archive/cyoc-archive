<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After several hours of videogaming, Charlie and his new jock friends/brothers, Eric, Pat, Landon and David were now very hungry. They started to give ideas of what to eat, pizza, burgers, fried chicken, etc. Their casual discussion was quickly intensifying, so Charlie decided to use his magic hand to appear some pizzas on their kitchen and then he told his friends that they&#39;re there.<br />
<br />
None of them questioned about it, Charlie was their leader despite he was way more smaller than any of them. So, they went to the kitchen and ate pizza after pizza. Maybe, without Charlie&#39;s magic, feeding these four big guys would be very expensive for any family.<br />
<br />
Charlie didn&#39;t eat too much but he didn&#39;t leave the table where they&#39;re eating because he wanted to watched how developed his friends had turned one by one. He used his magic again but this time to freeze them in their current position. Then he began to watch each of them with more detail.<br />
<br />
The first one was Eric, who always has been his shortest friend. When he was a kid he wasn&#39;t taller than 5&#39;, now as a 18 years old man, he was only a half feet taller. For a moment, Charlie thought about giving him a few more inches of height but, then he thought that being short was a part of Eric&#39;s charm. Also, his latin heritage gave him a cute olive skin color that goes perfectly well with his usual mischievous grin. Charlie almost decided he won&#39;t change anything about Eric until he watched his bulge. He also seemed small down there, so in order to give him something to be proud about he increased his dick a few inches until he was 7&quot; soft with matching balls.<br />
<br />
Then, Charlie focused on Pat, who was the opposite to Eric. He was a tall kid and now he was still the tallest one among his friends. Due to his swedish heritage, he was the whitest guy too. It didn&#39;t help him that his hair was blonde even on his body. So, Charlie thought that it could be a good idea to give him some tan. His skin turned a few shades darker like he sunbathed everyday. To make him look a little bit more manlier, Charli also increased the amount of body hair on him which also gave him a new beard that now was covered with cheese and tomato sauce.<br />
<br />
Landon, his most recent friend was also a very white guy like Pat, and just a few inches shorter than him. Because Charlie didn&#39;t want to do the same with him like he did with Pat, he decided to make a mayor change on him. After he waved his hand, Charlie noticed that a black shadow was covering Landon&#39;s body from toes to head. As it moves upward, some aspects of Landon changed too. His feet increased a few sizes, his legs got thicker. When it covered his crotch, Charlie noticed how Landon dick and balls swelled to almost ridiculous proportions. That kept happening until the shadow covered Landon&#39;s face and his lips, nose and eyebrows became more prominent like a very stereotypical afroamerican. Charlie learned that changing races implied way more than just skin color.<br />
<br />
Finally, there was David who was his best friend. He was still impressed of how good looking was his friend as an young man, so, he decided to make minor changes on him. First, he gave him a tattoo on his left pec. Charlie remembered how much David wanted to get a tattoo when he became an adult. Then, he increased David&#39;s hair on his face, so he could manage to get a full beard if he wants to. After doing that, Charlie noticed that his friend was getting a prominent receding hairline. To make sure, he won&#39;t be bald in a near future, he gave him a lot more of hair. Unfortunately, Charlie didn&#39;t make a very good job because it also increased David&#39;s hair on his armpits and crotch. Now his pubes were protruding from above his jockstrap.<br />
<br />
After watching all the changes he had made, Charlie unfrozen his friends who kept eating ignoring the changes that were made on them. Landon even had a different voice but none really noticed.<br />
<br />
When they finished their meal, David raised his left arm and sniffed his armpit hair without realizing it was more thick now. He suggested he needed a shower and almost immediately the other three guys also raised their arms and sniffed their own armpit hairs. They agreed and decided to take a shower too. The problem now, was that there was only one bathroom and all of them want to be the first one in there.</p>
