<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tobias and Amy had just moved into their apartment last week. it wasn&#39;t the nicest place but it was in their current price range. they were still unboxing their stuff. they decided to go to the small lobby to relax before putting up their dishes. the lobby was barely decorated. <br />
<br />
some cheap paintings hung on the walls. There were only 2 chairs near the false fireplace. they decided to take the seats to relax in. That was when they heard a rumbling. Suddenly some yellow liquid gushed down the stairs and out of the elevator. <br />
<br />
it was so powerful that it pushed them against the wall. they could feel the heat as it destroyed their clothing. strangely their bodies were unharmed. this sent their bodies into shock causing them to faint. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Tobias was the first to wake up. he immediately saw the unconscious body of his wife. he quickly moved to his naked partner and checked her pulse. while it was beating a little fast it proved she was still alive. he then noticed her brown hair darkened to a shiny black color.  <br />
<br />
he hadn&#39;t noticed that his hair was now onyx black. he raised his wife so she could lean against the wall. since they were already 25 years old the urine was able to affect them quicker than the others. As Tobias was the first to wake up he changed faster than his wife. his once short hair lengthened down his neck into a thick mane.  <br />
<br />
suddenly he felt his cock rise out of its sheath. his equine balls growing to the size of his fists. he was quickly overcome with a need to cum. he grabbed his cock with his hoof-tipped fingers. As he pumped his large cock black fur a few shades lighter than his hair quickly spread over his body.  <br />
<br />
his muscles becoming toned from years of swimming and flying. the latter was accomplished by his feathery wings on his back. his tail grew hair like his mane as it swats a fly. his hoofs made him unstable as they formed. thankfully Armeus had stopped pumping his cock to help him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;thanks I don&#39;t know what hapdenfw&quot; Tydas tried to say as his muzzle formed. &quot;got some hay in your mouth bro?&quot; his twin said as he sat down in the other throne themed seat. the 2 then began pumping again and soon ropes of cum covered the giant fireplace. some of it almost extinguished the fire itself. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Amy slowly woke up to a pounding headache. She brushed her black hair out of her vision. She then realized that her hair had changed color. As soon as this realization hit she suddenly remembered she always had black hair. seeing her husband jacking off was hot.  <br />
<br />
No, not hot, competitive. she began messaging her rapidly growing clit as her balls dropped into an impressively hairy sack. Their cock kept rising out of their sheath as their horns grew. Adam grunted in frustration as his cock became too wide for his hand. it had grown so much that it was so long now that it reached his chest.  <br />
<br />
As if to answer his frustration his testicles produced testosterone fit for the half-bull he was. Every muscle bulged larger than any human could possibly achieve naturally. next a massive surge in height. his 8 feet allowed the muscles to look more natural so to speak. after this was a simultaneous transition from female to male.  <br />
<br />
he gripped his cock with his hand as it grew in size. the other fondled his balls. his nice ass was now impressively muscular. a tail grew above it as a tuft of fur grew at its end. his once modest breasts were replaced with massive pectorals.  <br />
<br />
his neck thickened massively with muscle. he bellowed in pleasure with a voice that was intimidating and strangely sexy at the same time. his hair grew even longer and extremely wild. he always made sure he could see though. On his sack abdomen armpits and chest thicker fur grew in.  <br />
<br />
Armeus then heard his brother stumble and rushed to his aid. &quot;Thanks, I don&#39;t know what hapdenfw&quot; Tydas tried to say before stretching out his muzzle. &quot;got some hay in your mouth bro?&quot; he asked his twin. Tydas just rolled his eyes and sat down in one of the throne-themed chairs. Armeus followed as his own hoofs made him feel off for some reason.  <br />
<br />
they then went back to their cock competition. Neither could remember what started it but they were both determined to win. with excitement and mythical testosterone in his blood, his final changes began. his ear became large and furry. now resting under his horns.  <br />
<br />
a large muzzle grew forcing his eyes apart. this gave him a wider field of vision than a human. his teeth became longer and sharper. he licked his lips before he and his brother came. cum splattered across the fireplace. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
after they both were finished they realized what they had done. &quot;Man, that&#39;s gonna be hard to get out,&quot; Tydas said. the cum immediately glowed as it faded out of existence. getting up from their seats they turned around. &quot;be grateful thou two weren&#39;t the only ones to get horny  &#39;i  hither. Now I shall restore thy apparel.  remember thou shall hast to try whatever competition  &#39;i  thy own apartments or without this building.  understand?&quot; the landlord spoke.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh sure man whatever you say,&quot; Armeus said. the landlord&#39;s horn then glowed. Tydas now wore a one-piece swimsuit that could double as a flight suit. Armeus was more detailed. he now wore a leather belt with a green and brown kilt, underneath was a fuzzy loincloth.  <br />
<br />
he now wore a necklace around his neck while a green cape covered his upper back. his brown gloves helped him carry an axe or sword which ever one he felt like. &quot;Hey, want to head to the gym?&quot; the Pegasus anthro asked his brother. &quot;Nah let&#39;s go find some ladies&quot; the Minotaur convinced Tydas. they soon changed into their human disguises.  <br />
<br />
Tobias still had a wet suit under his t-shirt and shorts. meanwhile, Adam&#39;s cape had become a muscle shirt and his kilt became shorts. with that all victims of the giant dragon anthro had their lives changed forever. not that anyone would remember their old lives.</p>
