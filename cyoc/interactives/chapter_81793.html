<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a few seconds it did not seem that anything was going to happen.  I did not feel any different, nor did <br />
anything appear different.  Perhaps my wish had been too ambiguous and it had needed to decide what changes <br />
had to be made.  Then I noticed that my feet seemed farther away than normal.  I was only about 5'10&quot; so it <br />
seemed that I was growing taller.  This was confirmed to me as my pants moved farther away from my feet, <br />
exposing bare skin above my socks.  This was a good first sign.  I always wanted to be taller.  My socks did <br />
appear looser, however, like they weren't clinging as tight as they should.  I dismissed this as being my <br />
imagination.  I could also see that my shirt appeared shorter.<br />
<br />
I felt a tickle on the back of my neck.  I reached my hands up and felt hair growing longer.  I was a little <br />
surprised by this.  What the hell, I thought, I was curious how I'd look with long hair.  As I felt my <br />
lengthening hair I felt a couple of small pricking sensations on my hands.  I stopped touching my hair and put <br />
my hands in front of me.  My eyes went wide as I saw that my fingernails were longer than normal.  More so <br />
than that, I could see them growing longer still!  &quot;What the hell?&quot; I exclaimed.  My voice cracked as I spoke.  <br />
In addition to longer fingernails, it appeared that my fingers were thinner and more slender than they had <br />
been.  My attention was drawn to my arms as I could see the thin amounts of hair upon my hands and arms <br />
withdrawing into my skin.<br />
<br />
I was completely shocked.  I realized that I was turning into a woman!  My clothes began to feel looser in <br />
some areas and tighter in others.  I had to know what exactly was going on.  I didn't have any way to look at <br />
myself so I quickly wished for a full length mirror to appear in the room.  It suddenly appeared in the corner <br />
of the room.  I shuffled myself over to it.  In doing so I almost tripped.  This was because my shoes were <br />
suddenly too big for my feet.  I recovered my balance and kicked them off my feet.  I definitely saw that my <br />
socks were too loose.  <br />
<br />
When I got in front of the mirror I could see exactly what was changing.  The first thing that caught my <br />
attention was my hair.  It had grown down to my shoulders already and was still growing longer.  The color was <br />
also changing.  My hair was lightening from a dark brown to something different.  I couldn't tell for sure but <br />
it appeared that it was becoming blonde.  My shirt and pants looked very strange on me.  They were tight in <br />
some areas and loose in others.  I could see that I was definitely taller, perhaps by two or three inches.  <br />
<br />
It suddenly occurred to me that I could just make a wish and get all these changes to stop.  After all, was <br />
this really what I'd intended for myself?  But something prevented me from doing that.  Perhaps this is what I <br />
had intended.  I mean, if I wanted to become some kind of Adonis or Hercules, wouldn't I have said that <br />
specifically?  Did the ring have the power to read my subconscious?<br />
<br />
While I wanted to know the answers to these questions, they had to be put aside for now.  My hair continued to <br />
get longer and definitely blonder.  I had no hair left on my arms.  It occurred to me to see if my legs had <br />
undergone the same change.  I looked at my hands.  They were completely feminine with slender fingers and <br />
nails that were about a quarter inch long.  I reached down to the button on my pants.  It was extremely <br />
difficult to get it unbuttoned considering I'd never tried with these hands and nails before.  As I unbuttoned <br />
my pants I could tell that they were much looser on my waist.  Once I had them unbuttoned I tried to slide <br />
them off my body.  But this was also much more difficult than I'd anticipated as the pants were much tighter <br />
around my hips and my ass.  I had to jump up and down a few times to give extra force to get them off.  I was <br />
finally successful in removing them after a few attempts.  I also removed my socks.<br />
<br />
I looked at my legs and confirmed that they were also hairless now.  My legs also looked much different.  They <br />
seemed to be thinner and longer.  They also looked stronger, as if they had more tone and were in much better <br />
physical condition.  They somehow also felt stronger and sturdier.  I ran my hands over them and they felt <br />
toned.  They weren't muscular looking, but I felt that if I tried to kick someone I could put a lot of power <br />
behind it.  I looked at my feet and they were definitely smaller as well.  <br />
<br />
My face began to feel weird.  I looked at myself in the mirror and saw my face slowly alter.  My nose narrowed <br />
and became smaller in size.  My lips became fuller and also seemed to redden.  My cheeks rounded and my chin <br />
line receded.  My face took on a pronounced female appearance.  My eyelashes grew longer and my eyebrows <br />
thinned.  I did not feel any pain, just some odd pressure, as my face rounded and contorted into a completely <br />
different appearance.  In a few minutes my face essentially melted away into a completely different one.  <br />
<br />
I stood there and stared at my new face.  I was absolutely floored.  I had the face of a goddess.  I had the <br />
type of face that any human being would find irresistible.  It was just perfect.  There were no blemishes or <br />
marks.  It was perfectly shaped.  I was getting weird sensations just looking at myself.  I couldn't help but <br />
smile.  It was also perfect.  I mean, it was ravishing.  To flash this smile at someone could instantly make <br />
him or her weak in the knees.  I felt myself getting aroused just staring at my face.<br />
<br />
The feelings of arousal snapped me out of looking at my face.  I realized that my feeling of arousal was in <br />
two areas.  It was in my groin, but it was also in my chest.  I looked at my shirt again and saw that it was <br />
barely held up by my shoulders, yet due to my increased height my midriff was visible.  I tore off my shirt as <br />
fast as I could.  I took a quick look at myself.  My stomach was narrower and flatter.  It also appeared well-<br />
toned.  My arms also looked stronger without showing visible muscles, just the same as my legs.  My shoulders <br />
were narrower but also appeared stronger.<br />
<br />
I focused on my chest.  My nipples were firmly erect.  I run my fingers over them and felt an electric <br />
sensation throughout my body.  My knees even buckled a little.  My chest started to look puffy and I was eager <br />
to see what would happen there.  I could still feel my cock responding to my state of arousal.  I slid my <br />
hands under the waistband of my boxers and slipped them off.  They had almost fallen off due to my thinner <br />
waist but were held up by my widened hips.  I took a few seconds to admire my figure.  I had a perfectly <br />
curvy, hourglass figure.  I wasn’t thin as a rail, fortunately, as instead I actually had a little bit of meat <br />
of my bones.  I turned around and looked at my ass.  It was nicely rounded and heart-shaped.  I playfully <br />
slapped myself on it and loved the feeling of my soft skin.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile my cock was still fully present.  It was also fully erect.  But I could see that it was already <br />
smaller.  I cautiously reached down to touch it.  When I did I almost fell down.  It was so incredibly <br />
sensitive that just the very touch of it produced a feeling like nothing I’d ever imagined.  I felt shifting <br />
sensations in my groin as if something was moving inside my body.  I felt at my scrotum and was not surprised <br />
to find that it was empty.  I felt the skin pulling itself into my groin.  I watched as the tip of my cock <br />
slowly receded within the shaft which continued to get smaller.  <br />
<br />
Then my chest began to feel as if it was on fire.  I looked back at my nipples and saw them begin to push out <br />
from my body.  Tiny little cone shaped mounds sprouted from chest and soon blossomed into two perfectly <br />
rounded mounds.  The combination of my cock transforming into a pussy and my steadily increasing breasts made <br />
me moan softly.  My breasts continue to grow ever larger.  I had no idea how to judge breast size, but they <br />
were already the biggest breasts I’d ever seen personally.  Of course, I really hadn’t seen that many <br />
personally.<br />
<br />
I moaned quicker and sharper as the remainder of my cock disappeared and withdrew into my new pussy.  I let <br />
out a loud moan as I felt it settle inside my body.  I couldn’t help but immediately slide one of my hands <br />
down to my groin and feel my new are of feminine smoothness.  It didn’t take more than a few seconds for me to <br />
slide my fingers inside my pussy and begin exploring my womanhood.  At the same time I took my other hand and <br />
cupped my still growing breast.  I concentrated on my extremely sensitive nipple as I squeezed it roughly.  I <br />
couldn’t help but let out a few more moans.<br />
<br />
My moans made me realize that my mother could probably hear me downstairs.  I quickly took my fingers out of <br />
my pussy and tried to regain control over my body.  I saw that my hair and finally stopped growing about <br />
halfway down my back.  I could let it hang over my magnificent breasts as well.  My breasts had also finally <br />
stopped growing.  Damn, they were huge.  I wanted to know just how big they were so I wished to know their <br />
exact size.  “FF cup?” I exclaimed.  “Holy shit!”  I had no idea.  I thought breasts that large were insanely <br />
huge, that they would look gigantic on the woman with them.  But as I looked at my whole body they truly fit <br />
perfectly.  They looked perfectly proportioned on my frame.  Perhaps it was my over 6 foot height that made it <br />
that way.  I honestly didn’t care.  I absolutely loved the way I looked.  If this was the ring’s <br />
interpretation of my wish, then I was all for it.</p>
