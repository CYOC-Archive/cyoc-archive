<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a small town, a mysterious traveling carnival came and the patrons were having a grand old time.  From the rides, games, and shows, no one was disappointed with what this carnival has.  In the middle of the midway, a mother was with a young daughter, as they were looking for something fun to do.<br />
<br />
The girl looked to be ten-years-old and was wearing a pink sundress with a pair of pink sandals with gems on the straps.  Her sandy blonde hair was long and was done up in a ponytail, and her ears have pink diamonds on the lobes.  She already look like she was staring puberty as her arms and legs were long and thin her face is beginning to cross into adulthood with a slightly round skull, thin nose, and eyes shrinking a little bit.<br />
<br />
As for the mother, she looked to be no more then 35-years-old and has a fit body, but showing signs of aging.  She was wearing a form fitting crop white crop top that holds her D-cup breasts that were soft and showing some sag. <br />
 Her faded Capri pants have filled up her wide MILFy hips Muffin top stomach that has a scar in the front that was her C section when she had her daughter.  She wore a pair of Ugg snow boots that while it was summer, was very fashionable on her feet.  Her exposed arms remain toned, but were showing a bit of flab at her age.  There were also two types of faded tattoos on her arms, one showing a skull and crossbones with flames in the background and red eyes.  The other has a snake wrapped around her other arm and showing a cobra with a human heart in its mouth. <br />
 Probably left there during her younger rebellious side.  Her face resembled true beauty, but father time was catching up on her.  She had high cheekbones with deep faint lines and crows feet around her eyes, nose, and mouth.  Her light brown hair was a short and spiky bob cut with gray tips on them.  And wrapped around her neck is some kind of old arrow head wrapped in a silver necklace, with the arrowhead nestled between her huge breasts. <br />
 Truly a unique mother, but a caring mother too boot.<br />
<br />
The young girl was skipping while holding onto her red balloon as the mother looked to her going off on her own.  &quot;Candy!  Slow down!  This place is crowded and I don&#39;t want to loose you.&quot; she told her.<br />
<br />
The daughter, who is called Candy, looked to her mom and said, &quot;Sorry, mom.  I just want to have some fun is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she did a brisk walk and the mother caught up to her.  The two soon held hands as they were the usual mom and daughter bond.  For Amanda, who is Candy&#39;s mother, if felt like Candy was the closest things she has to happiness.  Ever since loosing his husband before her daughter, Candy was the only light in her life through the dark time.  But there are times that Candy tends to be troublesome from time to time.  She should know, she was a rebellious delinquent during her teen and college years, her mother was a rebellious punk back in the eighties, and her grandmother...  Well...  From what she heard from her mother that she was once a hippie living in a commune during the sixties.  And she would fear that her own daughter would start to go down that path and ultimately be far worse then her.  She just hope that Candy doesn&#39;t so anything that would be too crazy when she&#39;s older, otherwise she might have to do something rash to her.<br />
<br />
As she was thinking, she heard Candy freaking out over something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!  Mommy!  Look!  Look!  Let&#39;s go in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard her and looked down to see what she&#39;s pointing at.  Looking to that direction, she noticed a building that looked big enough for a small house.  Over the open door, there was an hourglass that keeps turning when the sand goes from the top to bottom and a neon sign beneath it that says...<br />
<br />
&quot;The Mysterious Age Room?&quot; she asked herself as she scratched her head.  &quot;What is that?  Some kind of haunted house or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
But before he could figure out what it was, Candy let go of her mother&#39;s hand and ran off, letting go of the balloon in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on mom!  Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda saw that and didn&#39;t expect her to run off like that.  &quot;Candy!  Where are you going?  Get back here!&quot; she told her daughter as she went after her.<br />
<br />
Candy went ahead into the house size building as Amanda chased her in there.  When Candy entered through the open door, she looked around and noticed that it was dark from within.  At the same time, Amanda got in soon after and took a breather.  &quot;Candy...  How many times do I have to tell you.  Don&#39;t run off without me.  Now come on.  Let&#39;s go.  This place is starting to give me the creeps.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grabbed her hand and was about to turn around to leave.  But as they were leaving, the doors in front of her started to close and the place was consumed in pure darkness.  Amanda saw that and was really scared.  &quot;Wha-  What&#39;s this?!  Who closed the doors?  Let us out!  I demand you to open that door, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she was knocking on that door hard while holding her child, the lights soon flipped back on and was split in two sides.  On one side, the color is pink, which was Candy&#39;s color.  On the other side it was Purple, Amanda&#39;s favorite color.  Candy and Amanda turned to see the room lit and noticed that not only colored lights on the ceiling, but also mirrors on the walls.  But what Candy saw that caught her attention was what&#39;s in front of them and pointed to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?  What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard her daughter and looked to see what she was starring at.  What she saw is two separate digital time counters, each having their full names above them.  The counters themselves were showing the years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, with the second counter ticking upwards.  Looking at the two clock counters, she rubbed the back of her head and said, &quot;How odd...  This room has two counters that know our names and accurate ages?  What type of place is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she asked that question, she could hear a voice coming from around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is what the sign say...The Mysterious Age Room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda and Candy were caught by surprise as the mother held on to her daughter and searched the room to find that person&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...  Who&#39;s there?  We heard you but we can&#39;t see you.  Show yourself!&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
She soon heard the response from the mysterious voice as it said, &quot;I am nowhere, yet everywhere Amanda Waller.  I am the Mysterious Age Room.  Glad I could make an acquaintance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two heard that voice and realize that the voice belonged to the room itself.  Amanda soon looked around to find the speakers that is connected to the voice while Candy looked upwards to the counter and was curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...  Are you a magical voice that&#39;s in charge of this room?  That&#39;s so cool!&quot; she said very excitedly.<br />
<br />
The voice heard her and chuckle, &quot;Yes, Candice Waller, that is cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda kept on looking around for a speaker and was confused.  &quot;Okay...  This is impossible.  No way that voice is created by magic.  There has to be a speaker around here somewhere that&#39;s making that voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there&#39;s no speaker, Amanda Waller, I am real.&quot; it said to her.<br />
<br />
Amanda stop with the search and gave a bit of a sigh.  &quot;All right, mysterious room, since you can hear us, care to explain to us what is going on around here?  I mean where exactly are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was a little confused and repeated what it said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said before.  This is the Mysterious Age Room.  It is where you will alter your age by aging or regressing to whatever age you desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard that and looked to the mirrors and counters within the room.  &quot;So...  Is that why there are mirrors around us and two counters with our names mysteriously on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room mentally nodded and said, &quot;That is correct, Amanda Waller.  The mirrors around you are for observing the changes in your body no matter what age you will get to be.  As for the age counters, they show your current ages right now, but that will change when you decide on which direction you will take.  If you regress yourself, the counter will rewind itself to the age you wish to be.  If you wish to progress yourself, the counter will fast forward to the age you want to be as well.  You can experience what your future will be like, or reminiscent on the past.  The choice is up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy heard that and was smiling from ear to ear.  Turning to her mother, she said to her, &quot;You hear that, mom?  We can change our age to whatever we want!  That&#39;s so awesome!  I can&#39;t wait to see what I look like when I grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard that and was a little unsure of that.  Aging or regressing someone in a room isolated from the outside world seems impossible.  But since this voice is echoing within this room without a speaker, she is starting to beleive it.  Still, there&#39;s one thing that has been bothering her and she needed to know about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot; Amanda asked, &quot;I mean if you said this room can alter our ages, there has to be a catch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room heard her question and answered with, &quot;That is correct, Amanda Waller.  All though this room can alter your age anyway you see fit, there are a few risks involved.  If you age past a hundred or on a specific year, you will die and your body would deteriorate into ash and be placed inside an urn.  But if you regress past new born...well, in interesting thing will happen.  See your mother will appear and you will be placed within your own mothers womb and remain there until you are born.  However, if you regress past conception, you will cease to exist.  What makes it interesting is that if your mother regress into infancy, then her mother will appear.  When she passes newborn status, then she will be in the her womb and when she regresses past the beginning of life, then she too will be erased from existence.  Then the same would happen to her mother, and then the next one, and the one after that, and the one after that, until it reaches to the very first generation, the seed of the family tree if you will.  From there, once that generation regresses into nothing, then your entire line will be no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda heard that and rubbed her chin for a little bit.  &quot;So what you&#39;re saying is that this process is limitless and if either me or Candy go too fat either way, then we will die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot; the room told her.<br />
<br />
Listening to the answer, Amanda was a little unsure if she wants to use this room or not.  After all, changing ages is fun, but not the risk of your own life.  &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
But Candy didn&#39;t care of the risk since she was young and approached mom and jump up and down with excitement.  &quot;C&#39;mon Mom!  Why do you always have to be a worry wart.  It would be fun to look into our future or experience our youth.  Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looked down to her daughter and could see the gleam in her eyes, delivering a puppy dog look with a few blinks.  She could tell that Candy was trying to convince her to give it a try, and she knows she can&#39;t say no to that face.  With a bit of a chuckle, she told her, &quot;Okay, sweetie.  If you want to try this room out, then we&#39;ll do it.  But under one condition.  If this is just another rip off this carnival has, then we are leaving.  Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy heard that and was excited as she jump up high in the air with her fist to the ceiling.  &quot;Yes!  Thanks mom!  You won&#39;t regret it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda smiled when her daughter was getting overly excited as she looked to the room&#39;s ceiling and told it.  &quot;All right, mysterious room, let&#39;s give this a shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room heard Amanda and said, &quot;Excellent.  Now, where do we begin.  Do you wish to Regress or Progress?&quot;</p>
