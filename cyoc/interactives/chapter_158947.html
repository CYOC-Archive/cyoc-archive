<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was like putting steak in front of a starving man. You could smell the human, even through the mix of beastman musk and sweat. The man smelled sweet, like a fresh apple. He was a farmer, you could tell that much, not only by his physique built from farm labor but from the smells that clung to him, livestock, freshly turned earth, dusty hay, and the earthy, pungent smell of a male in lust. He was young, probably about your age, only 19 or 20.<br />
<br />
Drale places a hand on your shoulder, bending over to whisper in your ear. &quot;Remember what it was like when Yuriv completed your change. The power, the freedom, you can give this man that.&quot;<br />
<br />
At your other side Riste is nodding eagerly. &quot;He&#39;s from my village, they kicked him out when they found he desired men. Called it unnatural. Here he can have what he wants. He&#39;ll be happy here with us, as a knight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two beastmen drive you forward like an angel and devil on your shoulders that both want the same thing. The same thing your mind is screaming out for you to do. You step up to the man. His gaze meets yours, a mix of fear and desire you know all too well. You reach out and grab his dick in your hand, roughly stroking it as he lets out little moans of pleasure, he&#39;s got a nice tool, not overly long, but thick. His muscular chest is covered in a light dusting of dark hair. He would have been bigger than you as a human, but now you had the edge over him, just slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around.&quot; You growl. &quot;Hands on the table.&quot; The man does as instructed. You keep your hand on his cock, drawing close to his back as he turns away from you. There&#39;s some hooting and hollering from the crowd of knights as you take charge. You can feel all eyes on you, eager for the show, eager to have this man join them, eager for you to become on of them as well.<br />
<br />
You let go of the young man&#39;s cock, causing him to whimper, but your paws soon find a place on his slightly hairy ass, stroking it. &quot;Do you like having your fuzz petted? Do you want more?&quot; The prisoner lets out a whimper and a nod. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marn.&quot; His voice is surprisingly soft, and not all that deep.<br />
<br />
You slide a finger into Marn&#39;s hole, working him around a little. &quot;Do you want to be one of us, Marn?&quot; Maybe, deep down you still want to fight this. If he agrees, maybe your sin won&#39;t be so bad. But you can&#39;t resist, not now, not anymore. The beast has grip of your mind, the cat that wants this farmboy to play with and breed with.<br />
<br />
Marn nods his head, and you feel a heafty paw on your shoulder for a moment. Silent encouragement from Drale. You know this is your last chance to turn back, to turn away from this and flee. For a moment Yuriv enters your mind, the joy on his face when you tell him you&#39;ll stay..<br />
<br />
You trust your cock inside Marn, the pre that has been leaking over your shaft causing it to glide in with ease. This is a hole that has known a man&#39;s cock before, Marn takes it expertly. Perhaps he really was exiled from his town for making love to men. Fur instantly begins to spread along Marn&#39;s ass, short and coarse, but a similar smokey gray as yours.<br />
<br />
There&#39;ll be no slow change over days here like you went through, his humanity will slip away in minutes. Already the coarse grey pelt is sliding down his legs, forcing him to shift his stance as his calves shorten and feet elongate. His ass and thighs are packing on muscle. He&#39;s already a big boy and only looks like he&#39;s going to come out the other end bigger. Soon the sound of hooves scrabbling on floor boards reaches your ears as he tries to regain his footing. Though your grip on his hips doesn&#39;t allow him to slip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Riste!&quot; The rat jumps as you shout his name. &quot;Be a good knight and suck our prisoner off.&quot; Why does barking orders seems so natural, and the rat seems eager enough to obey, crawling beneath the straddled legs of the farmboy and taking his cock into his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try, sir. But it&#39;s getting pretty big!&quot; You reach around to put your own hand on that cock, and find Riste isn&#39;t wrong. Marn&#39;s cock has already doubled in size, you can even feel the sway of his heavy nuts as your ride him. But Riste does as ordered and laps his tongue along Marn&#39;s shaft, eliciting more groans of pleasure from the young man, the the moans are growing husky a deep.<br />
<br />
His chest begins to barrel out, as his shoulders broaden. Every push into him causing him to swell a little bit more. New strength enters his arms as the nails on his hands turn thick and black. That short gray fur sprouting all over his body does little to conceal the definition of his muscles. His periodic moans turn into gasps as he stretches his neck out, elongating, thickening. His jaw and nose pushing out into a blunt rounded muzzle as his moans turn into rough brays.<br />
<br />
You reach up and grab a fistful of black mane sprouting from the top of his head in a bristled mohawk, and pull his head up as he tries to lower it. You want all the knights to see what you are making. His ears stretch to points on either side of his head, flicking and twitching as they catch new sounds.<br />
<br />
Marn lets out the loudest braying sound yet, and you head a sound of surprise coming from Riste underneath him as the donkey has his first orgasm. A practical geyser of seed spraying the rat in the face. Oh, this one is going to be popular in the barracks. His ass tensing around your cock causes you to give one last thrust and with a growl you fill him with your seed just as the fur grows to cover his face.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, you pull out of the first beastman you&#39;ve made, a bears heavy thick arms wrapping around you in an excited hug. &quot;Welcome to the knights, brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights?&quot; You say, breathy and weary from your exertion.<br />
<br />
Drale laughs heartily. &quot;Yes, only beastmen who have claimed a human can be full knights. Marn here will be your squire. As Riefclaw said, you&#39;re to be a general, so you must first become a knight!&quot; You feel some of your strength returning and look over at Marn. He is standing up and looking himself over. He looks.. thrilled, he looks happy. You&#39;d be happy to with that monster of a cock swinging between the donkey&#39;s legs. The other knights and squires are clapping him on the shoulder, giving him excited welcomes, which comes with some kisses and cock tugs. Everyone seems so genuinely happy.<br />
<br />
Riste pops up, still splattered with donkey seed, though Drale releases you to help his squire clean up, with liberal application of bear tongue. A clearing of a throat brings your attention back to Marn. &quot;I, uh, thank you.&quot; His voice is deeper and a bit rougher.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re glad I did this?&quot; You say, perhaps a bit sharper than you mean to. &quot;Took your humanity away?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marn looks thoughtful for a moment and nods his head. &quot;I.. feel like me. I&#39;ve always felt out of place and different but now.. I feel right.&quot; He rubs at the back of his neck, bashfully looking to the floor. &quot;I understand I&#39;m to be your squire. I&#39;ll be happy to serve you however you&#39;d like.&quot; A furtive glance to your cock makes it clear he means that in more ways than just helping you with armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just..&quot; You&#39;re not even sure how it works. &quot;Stick with the knights here for now. When things are settled I&#39;ll.. we&#39;ll..&quot; You stumble on your words. Have you made your decision to stay. You want to now, more than ever, to run up to the castle and tell Yuriv you want to be with him forever, and to occasionally fuck this well hung squire of yours cross-eyed. Or is that the curse talking again. &quot;They&#39;ll get you settled in.&quot; Marn nods and wanders over to join the others, seemingly ramping up into a circle jerk.<br />
<br />
An amulet drops onto your chest as the chain settles around your neck. Drale replacing what he took just as he promised. &quot;Come with me.&quot; The bear&#39;s voice is gruff, but meant to be inviting. You follow him over to a corner of the room where Riste already sits. He motions for you to sit, when you don&#39;t he shakes his head. &quot;Just hear me out for a few minutes and then you can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this Riefclaw&#39;s plan? Offer me freedom then tempt me with.. what I did?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drale nods his head. &quot;He wanted you to see both sides. You are important to Yuriv, and so he of course wants you to stay, and mated to his son you&#39;d be like a son to him, too.&quot; You take a seat as the bear continues. Despite your first encounter with the ursine, you actually find yourself liking him. &quot;I want to tell you my story. I was a soldier in service to the old duke. Nobility, rulers, they use their knights and soldiers as much to keep their own populace in line as they do to keep their borders safe. Before I joined Riefclaw I was as likely to turn my sword on an unruly peasant as a bandit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since I joined him..&quot; The bear motions to the room. &quot;Everyone who follows Riefclaw is happy. We may give up some of our free will, but we&#39;re safe, content. Everyone who serves him has a job and enough money to have food and a home. We&#39;re allowed to express our feelings for each other in ways that used to be taboo for no reason other than they made some people uncomfortable. Look at the rebellion! Riefclaw ended it without even a drop of blood being spilled. With any other noble that would have been a bloodbath. We knights are here to protect the peasants, defend our borders, and bring in new recruits. All are happy in the end. But you&#39;re the first I&#39;ve ever seen being given the choice to leave. Let me just say, I wouldn&#39;t leave for anything.&quot; One of his big arms wraps around his rat companion and the two actually share a look you&#39;d call love. You&#39;ve seen Yuriv look at you the same way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go, Nate, make your decision. I hope you stay.&quot;</p>
