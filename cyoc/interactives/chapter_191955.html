<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Right, first thing’s first…clothes.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes slowly moved around the eerie laundry room as you half expected to see someone waiting to ambush you in the confined area. The room itself was more of a storage area than anything else, with a typical laundry chute and container that had acted as your way in, but with no facilities to actually wash the clothes. Instead, the collected clothes were sorted by type and placed on shelved racks that reached up to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Given that the room was relatively neat and tidy, you were quickly able to find what you were looking for as you started to assemble inconspicuous new outfits for both you and Jessica. <br />
<br />
Having decided that you had to be able blend in, you decided to avoid anything too flashy as you found plain T-shirts, hoodies, trousers, socks, shoes and underwear for each of you. You were glad to no longer be naked as you got dressed where you were. This thought then prompted you to hurry up as you imagined Jessica sick with worry as she kept watch outside.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, you stuffed Jessica’s new clothes into a discarded rucksack, before you decided to head upstairs to the two rooms you had previously peered into through the window. <br />
<br />
First, you came to the filing room, which seemed to be very well-ordered as you peered inside. The room contained a few dozen blocks of cabinets arranged in rows, as well as a few tables and desks where the files inside could be studied. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, you turned and opened a cabinet labelled ‘Aviary.’ Inside, you saw that the records were arranged chronologically by year. You casually pulled one file out from March this year, and were instantly alarmed by the sheer scale and efficiency at which this evil Zoo was operating.<br />
<br />
You stared in disbelief at the spreadsheet for just a single month, as you saw dozens of names listed down the left-hand side under a column which simply read ‘acquisitions.’ Alongside this, there was a wealth of other information about each of the victims, with details about how long they had been transformed, what their new species was, and whether they now lived in an exhibit or had been sold to another institution. Worryingly, there was also a ‘personal information’ column, under which details about addresses, partners and loved ones had also been noted where available. <br />
<br />
Seeing all of this made you feel sick as you returned the file and shut the cabinet. All those people on that spreadsheet were now trapped as animals for the rest of their lives, and that had only been one exhibit’s turnover for a single month. You knew that there could easily be thousands of names listed between all of these records, which made you wonder exactly why this had been allowed to continue. Surely this operation had some extremely powerful backers, probably the police and the government itself. But exactly why anyone would want such a vile place to exist was beyond your comprehension.<br />
<br />
You continued to think about this shocking revelation as you made to leave the room. However, you stopped when you spotted another cabinet labelled ‘Stables’ near the door. Despite knowing that time was of the essence, curiosity managed to get the better of you as you started to wonder what would have been in store for you and Jessica if your escape attempt had failed.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, you sheepishly opened the top draw of the cabinet and started to look through the records for the last week. Sure enough, you were quickly able to find your name under the ‘acquisitions’ column. Seeing your own entry and the details listed beside it made you feel a bit queasy as you had a few flashbacks to your time as Princess. <br />
<br />
First, your eyes were drawn to one entry which read: ‘Physical Appearance: healthy, strong, fertile,’ while another beside it stated: ‘Temperament: nervous, responsive to training, sexually frustrated.’ Seeing this made you feel hot with a mix of shame, disgust and embarrassment as you were reminded of your sick ‘training’ regime under Vicky’s sadistic guidance. Even now, you could still vividly remember the feeling of your old mare cunt dripping with arousal and winking seductively open and closed whenever you had admired one of the Stables’ sexy stallions. Moreover, you distinctly remembered some of the tactics Vicky had used to mock and belittle you, the most disturbing of which being the way she used to mock you about your change of gender whenever she played with your needy equine vagina. <br />
<br />
Reflecting on your ordeal as a mare made you feel sick as you fought to get these twisted memories out of your head. However, the images in your mind only grew more intense as you kept reading. In particular, one note which recommended that you be sent to a local stud farm seemed to strike a sensitive nerve as you thought about your transformation and subsequent mating with Harry. Disturbingly, you could still clearly recall the size and girth of the massive black stallion as he stuffed his dick inside you again and again. In fact, you could even remember whinnying out in delight as your vagina hugged and massaged his huge, throbbing organ; only for the pent up energy to finally explode in a powerful orgasm as he flooded you with his warm, sticky stallion cum. <br />
<br />
These final few flashbacks proved too much for you as you quickly shut the cabinet. You knew it was better to concentrate on your escape rather than your recent time as Princess. This, and the thought that Jessica was probably starting to get worried, caused you to hurry as you headed for the final room at the end of the corridor.<br />
<br />
As you quickly moved towards the eerie store room you immediately saw that it was arranged similarly to the filing room; with the various cabinets clearly arranged by exhibit. <br />
<br />
Upon opening one of the cabinets up, you saw that it was packed full of zip-up plastic bags, similar to evidence bags that you might see on your typical crime drama. Inside the bags were various personal items like phones, ID cards, car keys and other important valuables.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing this, you wondered if you would find your or Jessica’s phone somewhere in here. Having one would certainly be useful for any escape attempt. With this goal in mind, you hurriedly opened up a cabinet labelled ‘Stables’ before you began sifting through the various belongings inside.<br />
<br />
After briefly flicking through a dozen-or-so of these evidence bags, you did eventually find what you were looking for as you recognised your phone and car keys, along with Jessica’s purse and one of her expensive necklaces.<br />
<br />
These finds made your mood lift as you sensed that there might be some hope of escaping after all. However, you didn’t have long to celebrate this change of fortune before you heard a frantic tapping on the window beside you. You turned and were relieved to see Jessica standing there, beckoning you to hurry up and get out of there.    <br />
<br />
“Oh baby, thank God you’re safe,” Jessica said in relief as you extracted your belongings and cracked open one of the windows, “you were taking so long that I was getting worried. Anyway, hurry up and get out of there, I thought I heard a vehicle somewhere nearby.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made your heart race as panic quickly set in. In response you quickly gathered your recovered possessions before you clumsily clambered out through the open window. You then made sure to let the window slam shut behind you, before you led Jessica back into the cover of the trees; until you were confident that you couldn’t be spotted from the nearby road.<br />
<br />
The two of you paused for a moment as you both caught your breath. In fact, it was only when the distant sound of an engine came and went that you finally allowed yourselves to relax. <br />
<br />
“So? Jessica finally asked, “what did you find? Anything that can help us escape this damn place?”<br />
<br />
“Well…” you said with a smile, “first off I got you these,” you said proudly as you pulled out the clothes you had borrowed from the laundry room. “This will at least help us to blend in with the other guests.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect” Jessica said graciously, as she quickly started to get dressed, “anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” you said as you revealed the two bags filled with your combined possessions, “I also found these in one of the storerooms. Having our phones might be all we need to finally get out of here, especially now that we ought to blend in much better with the other guests.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a plan,” Jessica said as she finished putting on the last pieces of her new outfit, “I think I’ve had enough of this awful place.<br />
<br />
“Couldn’t agree more,” you replied in solidarity, “now let’s not waste any more time…”<br />
<br />
With that, you and Jessica held each other’s hands firmly before you carefully started heading back towards the main Zoo complex and hopefully your freedom...</p>
