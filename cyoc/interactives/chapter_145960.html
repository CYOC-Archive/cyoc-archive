<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A hand touched his shoulder lightly and a feminine voice asked, &quot;Kaitlyn, honey, get up,&quot; and for a moment, Jacob was confused as to what was going on.<br />
<br />
Then it all came back and yawning, still not feeling the greatest, he simply nodded and, before he could stop himself, he replied, &quot;Yes, mom,&quot; as he looked up at Kaitlyn&#39;s mom, then rolled over, sat up, yawned and then stood.<br />
<br />
His sleep addled mind insisting this was his mom and that he was Kaitlyn, Jacob found himself unable to figure out what was what. Barely listening to his mom, which he thought was Kaitlyn&#39;s mom, leading him to ask himself if he was Kaitlyn, talk softly with Ms Redding, Jacob tried to shake off the confusion. Unable to do that, he allowed himself to be led out of the nurse&#39;s office, through the school and out. When he reached his mom&#39;s car, he climbed in the passenger side and as he buckled his seat belt, he barely heard his mom ask, &quot;You aren&#39;t simply faking to get out of school, are you missy?&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment of clarity slipped over him and, as he told the woman his mind insisted was his mom, &quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; he silently reminded himself, &quot;Mrs Johnson is Kaitlyn&#39;s mother. My mom is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clearheaded sensation abruptly leaving as he tried to say his mom&#39;s name, Jacob found himself troubled that he couldn&#39;t remember her first or last name, simply that she was Ashley&#39;s mom. Nothing making sense, his mind raging back and forth between that he was Jacob and he was Kaitlyn, and from there leaping to odd connections, he leaned back and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
At some point, he must had fallen back asleep, cause the next thing he knew his mom was shaking him awake. Blinking, he listened as she told him, &quot;Go upstairs and lay down,&quot; and nodding, he told her, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The buckle on the seat belt making a click noise as he undid it, Jacob started to climb out of the car. Seeing the house next door, he had another moment of clarity as he remembered that was were he lived. But then, as he took a step forward, stumbled a bit, found himself looking instead at the house his mom&#39;s car was parked in the driveway of, the clear feeling left and he was sure this was where he lived. Unsure which was right, he hesitated a moment before heading for the closer of the two houses. Figuring his mom knew where they lived and that he was simply addled because of being tired and not feeling the best, he started up the front steps.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the front door, he followed his mom in and kicked off his shoes where he normally left them. Starting toward the steps up, he stopped and looking first down at what he was wearing, then in the direction his mom was going, his mind torn between liking and disliking his clothing style, Jacob asked, &quot;Mom? Would it be all right for me to go clothes shopping sometime? Maybe, I could get something, I don&#39;t know, that didn&#39;t look so,&quot; and trailing off, unsure how to finish, he listened as his mom said, &quot;We&#39;ll see. For now, bed, young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Content, certain this would be the best answer he&#39;d get, Jacob nodded and headed upstairs. Heading toward his bedroom, which he tried to think of as Kaitlyn&#39;s room, but found it didn&#39;t feel right to do so, he closed the door and stared at the bedroom, not really taking anything in. Nothing making sense, Jacob tried to sort out what was his life and what was Kaitlyn&#39;s life. Everything blending after some time, finding holes in memories, others heavily fragmented, he huffed in agitation. Heading for the dresser he couldn&#39;t determine whether it was his or Kaitlyn&#39;s, which only seemed to make his mind swim even more when he tried to make sense of it, he opened the drawers and took out a pair of leggings and a nightgown. Stripping down to underwear and bra, he hesitated a moment before taking off the brasserie.<br />
<br />
Hastily, he tossed the clothes off to the side of the dresser, like he normally did, his mind assured him. Walking over to the closet, stilling holding the garments he&#39;d taken from the dresser, Jacob opened the door and peered into the mirror hung on the back of the door. His normal male appearance was still lacking as he stared at the reflection of Kaitlyn. Peering down, he considered that, except for the fact that he had two, tiny, double A cup tits and that the front of his underwear was flat, he still could see his normal male body. Hesitating for a moment, yet, at the same time, wanting answers, he eventually pushed down on the pair of panties he was wearing.<br />
<br />
When they were down around his ankles, he stared at his flaccid penis, thinking it didn&#39;t look right. Spreading his legs, he tried to shake loose his scrotum, which he figured was stuck between his legs. When it did appear, Jacob began to grow concerned. Reaching down, he lightly pinched the flesh, his hand brushing against the tampon string as he did so, and tried to pull it forward. When it didn&#39;t, and all that he sensed he was accomplishing was to cause himself to grimace, Jacob grew alarmed. Thinking, &quot;What the,&quot; he touched the area between his legs, stepped out of his underwear, lifted his left leg and shifted about until he could look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
As he did this, he also tried to look down past his dick. But, failing to see anything beyond what he could see, he settled on looking in the reflective object for a minute or so before dropping his leg. Terrified by the thought that he&#39;d lost his scrotum and that it had become part of the exterior genitalia he could see when he lifted his leg and looked into the mirror, Jacob suddenly felt like he wanted to cry. Pulling back on his panties, the last bit of his boy parts slipping between his legs as he did so, Jacob shrugged on the white nightgown, a picture of a pastel pony printed on the front, started to put on the leggings, but, at the last moment, changed his mind and tossed them into the laundry basket. Heading for his bed, he crawled beneath the covers and tried to figure out how he was going to find Kaitlyn.<br />
<br />
Slowly, he drifted into an uneasy sleep that was plagued by shadowy figures and images that felt more like memories. When he awoke to a door slamming, he realised it must be because his sister was home. Still not feeling the greatest, he almost rolled over and went back to sleep. But then, an idea coming to him, Jacob rolled out of bed and stole across his room. Opening the bedroom door a crack, he listened a moment before creeping out and downstairs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the steps, he listened. Not hearing Emily, his mom or his dad, he moved quickly toward the telephone and picking it up, he stopped, unable to remember the number for the house next door. Struggling for a moment, fearful he&#39;d be caught and that he&#39;d have some explaining to do, it slowly came to him the phone number. Dialing it, he listened to it ring a couple times before it was picked up and a familiar voice said, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved for the first time to hear Ashley&#39;s voice, somewhat glad she&#39;d answered, but wishing she hadn&#39;t, Jacob almost gushed out a plea for her help. But, catching himself at the last second, he took a deep breath and replied, &quot;Can I speak with Jacob? It&#39;s urgent.&quot;<br />
<br />
A pause, then, &quot;Who is this? I think you have the wrong number. There&#39;s no Jacob here.&quot;</p>
