<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Flowering Tree <br />
Segment Three <br />
&quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;<br />
<br />
Crispan and his mother lie in repose, the former lazily content and <br />
snuggling into the bosom of the latter.  She however, looks more dazed <br />
than content.<br />
A knock at the door shatters their mismatched reverie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Allia!  Crispan! Are you there?&quot; a cheer full, if wearied basso voice <br />
calls.<br />
The sound of the voice brings a flush to Crispan's mother's skin which <br />
in turn causes Crispan's stem begin to swell again.  Pushing Crispan <br />
away, she jumps<br />
out of the pallet bed and snatches up her blouse and rushes to her <br />
clothes press, snatching a simple wrap-skirt from it.  The scent of <br />
her embarrassment and <br />
agitation brings upright and causes his stem to rise more swiftly and <br />
his flower and fruit to churn.  <br />
&quot;A cloud of sprites take it,&quot; Crispan's mother mutters as she dresses <br />
and hurries up to the entry level of their home<br />
<br />
 &quot;For goodness sake 'Pan get dressed!&quot; she says as she passes the <br />
entrance to his room.  <br />
Crispan stretches languorously his erection making a tent of his <br />
blanket.<br />
&quot;I don't see why you're worried Mother,&quot; he calls after her,&quot;It's not <br />
like Lissir hasn't seen us both sky-clad before.&quot;<br />
He cocks his head to listen for a response, but all he hears are his <br />
mother's footsteps and then the lesser  main entrance door open. He <br />
rubs the lump<br />
his stem makes through the blanket, noting that though it stays erect <br />
and if anything, gets harder, it begins to become a little smaller and <br />
slimmer<br />
as the scent of his mother dissipates.  He hears the murmur of <br />
conversation Between Lissir and Allia as the move from one room to <br />
another above him.<br />
His brows draw together as he runs through the recent events, still <br />
rubbing his hard, slender stem through the blanket. Reaching with his <br />
unoccupied hand,<br />
Crispan draws his mother's trousers to his face.  Burying his nose in <br />
the still damp crotch of the trousers, Crispan takes a tentative <br />
sniff.  Under his <br />
other hand, his stem swells longer and thicker.  Pulling the trousers <br />
away from his face, Crispan  takes a few breaths of the room's air, <br />
feeling his<br />
stem slowly drift back down to its' shorter and slighter <br />
configuration.<br />
&quot;hmmm,&quot; he murmurs to himself, &quot;I wonder...&quot;<br />
His hand leaves his stem and casts the blanket aside as he spreads is <br />
legs and explores the gently dripping lips of his flower.  One, then <br />
two fingers <br />
enter easily enough, stopping only where they join his hand, a third <br />
finger stretches his flower tightly enough for discomfort.  <br />
Switching back to two fingers, he works them in and out of his <br />
slickenning flower.  Crispan brings the trousers to his face again, <br />
inhaling <br />
deeply of the remnants of Allia's excitement. His stem quickly doubles <br />
in length and trebles in size, throbbing insistently between the heel <br />
of<br />
 his hand  and his suddenly rippled belly. His flower tightens until <br />
two fingers are far too much shallowing until the single permitted <br />
digit <br />
bottoms out midway past his first knuckle.  Absently swirling his <br />
middle finger in the shrunken flower, Crispan draws the trousers away <br />
from his face<br />
 again.  As the his head clears of the scent of his mother, his flower <br />
opens further, once again allowing two fingers the span of their <br />
length to work<br />
 in and out. <br />
&quot;Crispan, Allia said you were ill and not to disturb you,&quot;  Lissir's <br />
calls as he approaches Crispan's room,&quot; but you know how I hate to <br />
sleep by myself,<br />
and Allia said she needed to go speak to your father about something.  <br />
So would you mind if I crawled in with---&quot;<br />
Crispan smiled as the older man stuttered to a stop a few steps into <br />
his room.  Lissir looked much as Crispan remembered him, heavily <br />
muscled arms<br />
 bracketing a chest that once seemed as big as the sky, had not seemed <br />
to get much smaller as the years passed and Crispan had grown taller. <br />
Though <br />
the green-haired child had a few moons ago reached and passed Lissir's <br />
modest height.  Pale gray eyes seemed round as saucers under Lissir's <br />
bushy black<br />
 brows.  His full, dark beard was still cropped short, the jaw it ran <br />
along was slack with shock.<br />
Crispan  dropped his mother's trousers and withdrew his playing <br />
fingers from his flower, they glistened with it's juices. He met <br />
Lissir's pale gray gaze<br />
with his amber eyes, the smile upon his own lips twisting with <br />
amusement. <br />
&quot;Well 'Uncle Lissir', you are certainly welcome in my bed!&quot; Crispan <br />
says as he stands up, moving from pallet bed to floor and stepping <br />
toward<br />
Lissir.  Crispan scents the other man, the layers of pungent sweat on <br />
clothing mixed with the dust of his travel, the muffled scent of sweat <br />
from Lissir's <br />
nethers causes a pang to sing through Crispan's flesh.  As Crispan <br />
closes the distance betwixt them, his hips begin to broaden and <br />
breasts swell upon his<br />
chest, bouncing slightly with his steps, his own scent alters as he <br />
becomes more feminine gaining a slightly floral tang rather than musk.<br />
Lissir's  mouth opens and closes as he watches Crispan come toward <br />
him, the crotch of his travel-stained trousers becoming tight as his <br />
manhood swells. <br />
Swallowing hard, Lissir tries to shake his head to clear it. Crispan <br />
laughs softly, his tenor shifting to an alto as the lips of her flower <br />
darken and<br />
swell. Her stalk becomes even more modestly-sized, above the thickened <br />
shroud it seems barely longer or thicker than her thumb, though still <br />
crowned with a<br />
dripping, cherry head.  <br />
&quot;Crispan, what happened to you while I was away?&quot;  Lissir finally <br />
manages to ask, his pupils expand as Crispan gets closer,<br />
&quot;I seem to be growing up Lissir,&quot; she responds, running her hands over <br />
his shoulders, &quot;Aren't you proud of me?&quot;<br />
Confusion, and lust chase each other across Lissir's features at <br />
Crispan's touch.  His fire-scarred hands clasp her arms.<br />
&quot;I thought you were going to grow into a man Crispan,&quot; Lissir says <br />
thickly, hands absently caressing the arms he had meant to push away. <br />
His man-root aches<br />
as it fights against the constraints of his trousers. <br />
&quot;Oh, I am, sometimes.&quot;<br />
Crispan pushes further in, burying her face in the spot where Lissir's <br />
neck meets his shoulder, he inhales deeply. Crispan moans as her <br />
flower deepens<br />
 and her stalk, instead of receding like it had for her Father, surged <br />
a little taller,  becoming as long as her middle finger and still <br />
slightly <br />
thicker than her thumb. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she murmurs, &quot;I wasn't quite expecting that,&quot; <br />
Crispan rubs her nude body against Lissir's clothed one, wrapping her <br />
arms around his neck and running her fingers through the short black <br />
fuzz on his<br />
 scalp. Her small breasts rub along his cloth enclosed chest and her <br />
stem and flower soak the bulge in the rougher fabric of his trousers. <br />
Both of them are<br />
trembling now.  She brings her lips to his ear.<br />
&quot;Won't you come to bed dear Lissir and show me how you make Mother <br />
feel?&quot;<br />
With a nibble on his ear she releases him, her scent swirling in the <br />
air of the room. <br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;  Lissir asks thickly, as Crispan opens <br />
the closures of his over and undershirt, then drops to her knees to <br />
unlace Lissir's<br />
trousers.<br />
&quot;Oh, didn't you know I could hear you both then?&quot;  she chuckles as she <br />
looks down at his unbooted feet, clad in socks that Crispan's mother <br />
had knitted.<br />
Woodenly, Lissir shrugs out of his layers of clothing, eventually <br />
freeing his thick, aching cock, which bobs in the air with his <br />
heartbeat, drooling like it <br />
hadn't in years. His skin was flushed beneath the patchy darkening <br />
forge-work gave him, the skin from his waist down much paler than from <br />
the wait up. His cock<br />
 waved in the air before Crispan's  eyes, as long as a banana but and <br />
thick enough that Crispan's fingers barely touched base of Lissir's <br />
shaft<br />
when she reached out to grasp it. Lissir groans as Crispan slowly <br />
milks more clear fluid from his root. Bending close Crispan suckles at <br />
Lissir's cock, <br />
savoring the tangy fluid as her mother not so long ago savored his <br />
own.  <br />
Lapping down Lissir's shaft, she nuzzled the hanging sick beneath it, <br />
wondering at how similar and different it was from he own, wild black <br />
hair covered the <br />
sack and surrounded the base of Lissir's shaft.<br />
Putting her free hand upon her belly Crispan concentrated for a <br />
moment, she cast the charm against becoming pregnant. She briefly <br />
suckled at the head of <br />
his root, tasting again the salty drizzle that poured from it before <br />
rising to her feet, pressing her body against his all the way up.  Her <br />
stem <br />
jousting for a moment with his longer, much thicker root. pressing <br />
against Lissir she grinds her stem against the upper part of his shaft <br />
and her mound<br />
against the lower.<br />
&quot;Won't you come to bed and till my flower dear Lissir?&quot; Crispan pants <br />
into his ear.<br />
&quot;Gladly you little tease!&quot; Lissir growls as he lifts Crispan as if she <br />
weighed nothing at all, lowering her to the pallet as he kneels in it <br />
himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;To begin with, hardly lapping a fellow's cock is bound to rile him up <br />
badly, this is how you do it,&quot; Lissir snarls.<br />
Crispan gasps as the older man engulfs her stem in his hot, wet mouth, <br />
sucking and slurping at it while bobbing is down. Lissir made a <br />
strange snort-like<br />
sound each time the head of Crispan's stem grazed the back of his <br />
tongue. <br />
Crispan bucked and withed as the sensation flared through her.  Her <br />
flower began to quiver  and as his ministrations continued, one thick <br />
finger worth two<br />
of hers rubbed and danced on the twitching hole betwixt her cheeks, <br />
one huge thumb digging into hr spasming flower.<br />
Suddenly  Crispan arched as orgasm gushed from both her flower and <br />
surged along and out her stem, quickly swallowed by the working mouth.<br />
&quot;Well that was much sweeter than I'm used to tasting,&quot; Lissir smirked <br />
as he rubbed the traces of Crispan's orgasms from his mouth and beard<br />
Shifting position, Lissir lifted Crispan's legs a bit, grasped her <br />
soft waist and pulled her flower onto his thick root.<br />
Crispan wept as the needing emptiness was finally filled.  <br />
&quot;Please, yes! More!&quot; She cried tugging at what parts she could reach.<br />
&quot;Eager to oblige a friend in need&quot; Lissir responded and started slowly <br />
bucking his hips, working his manhood in and out of Crispan's grasping <br />
flower.<br />
&quot;Oh gods! Oh Gods! So good&quot; Crispan moaned, bucking her hips to meet <br />
his thrusts.<br />
Lissir moved one hand from her hips to kneed her breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's happening again!&quot; She cried as her orgasm made her flower <br />
clench and gush d her wildly bobbing stem spurt between the two.<br />
 <br />
Lissir groaned as his own orgasm came blasting into her flower in <br />
heavy bursts.  Leaning down he caught Crispan's mouth with his own, <br />
pressing <br />
their lips together before licking hers open with his tongue.  He bats <br />
her tongue with his and licks the insides of her teeth before breaking <br />
the kiss.<br />
&quot;So now will you let me get some rest?&quot;<br />
Sticky and exhausted Crispan laughed, feeling the softening cock still <br />
lodged in her flower.<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>
