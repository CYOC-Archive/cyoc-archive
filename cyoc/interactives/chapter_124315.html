<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bottle eventually lands on Kasumi, who has been standing silently since she was stripped. “This...this is crazy!” She finally says. She still seems frazzled, but she has a bit more control in her voice. “I had no idea it would actually work.” She takes a step backwards. “I don’t think we should be messing with.” Finally, some common sense. But you just know it isn’t going to last. <br />
<br />
“Like, c’mon Kasumi.” Cici says, standing up and walking over to her, almost stumbling as she drunkenly sways. She wraps an arm around Kasumi’s shoulders and starts carressing her with the other. She leans in close, her lips touching Kasumi’s ear. “Just make one little wish, honey.” Cici says seductively. Her tongue briefly darts out and into Kasumi’s ear. Kasumi’s eye roll back a bit as she exhales, moaning slightly. “You won’t regret it.” Cici assures her. Her hand reaches down and starts massaging Kasumi’s clit. <br />
<br />
Before it can escalate any further, Kasumi, clearly enjoying herself, says “Ok,ok. I’ll just one little, simple wish.” You roll your eyes. So much for being the smart one. Cici appluads before heading back to sit next to you. Kasumi contemplates for a moment before saying. “I mean, it did almost get Ricardo’s wish right.” Ricardo has been silently ogging the three of you, not saying a word. “Well, I’m gonna have to pay for a ride home, anyway.” With that she leans down, presses the button and very clearly says “ I wish I had ten more bucks!” You suspect she worded it that way to insure she gained more money, in case the Recorder made it so that she only had ten bucks. Still, the wish is very susceptible to misinterpretation.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the Recorder replies. “I wish I had ten more breasts!” Panic immediately engulfs Kasumi. “Oh no! No no no, please!” She pleads helplessly, her hands flying to her head in panic. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, you notice something growing in between Kasumi’s breasts. A fleshly lump is developing there, pushing itself out between her breasts. You all watch silently as it grows, soon larger than Kasumi’s orginal boobs. With a popping sound, a nipple emerges from the now dangling protrusion. Indeed, she is growing a third breast. At last, its stops growing. Kasumi’s normal breasts (you estimate) are around a B cup, but this new one is at least a D cup, dwarfing her original breasts. For a moment, nothing happens, Kasumai starring at her new appendage in silent horror. But you know it had only just begun. 1 down. Nine to go. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, you notice more growths emerging all over Kasumi’s body. Two new breasts begin growing right below her old ones, strechting her skin as fat gathers to form new mammeries. Suddenly, Kasumi turns around in a panic, trying to get a look at her backside. As she turns around, you notice several things happening. From her shoulder blades, another pair of breasts are growing on her backside. The skin under her tatoos bulges and conorts, as bulbous protuberances begin to take shape. Even more disturbingly, you notice Kasumi’s small but tight butt seems to be expanding. Her butt cheeks stretch and fill with fat, and start to dangle from her backside. Sure enough, with two succinct pops, nipples emerge. Her butt cheeks have become yet another pair of breasts. Massive, jiggling D-Cups at that. <br />
<br />
That’s seven new breasts, so far. Only three more to go. Kasumi’s turns to face you all again, a terrified look on her face. As you look into her horrified eyes, you suddenly notice her cheeks are beginning to grow. At first, it looks like she’s gain weight on her face, her cheeks becoming chubby. But then they start to hang from her face, and two nipples pop out on either cheek. Kasumi now has tiny breasts on her face, her mouth sandwiched between the two. Just one more breast to go. “This is bullshit!” Kasumi says, her voice somewhat muffled by her new facial boobs. “How am I supposed to guh...guh...” She abruptly seems to have trouble speaking. She opens her mouth wide. At first, you aren’t sure why, but when you look inside her gaping maw, you see the horrifying reason. Her tongue is blowing up, bulging and morphing. Its pink color becomes the same pale hue at Kasumi’s skin. The tip begins to bulge and fatten. Soon, it plops out of her mouth, growing about the same size as her facial breasts. Her mouth is open as wide as it can, her jaw muscles straining to carry this new addition to her mouth. With one final pop, her tongue has become her tenth and final new breast. <br />
<br />
At first, you start to panic, fearing Kasumi can’t close her mouth, or that she won’t be able to eat or drink. But after a few seconds, Kasumi manages to gulp her new tongue back into her mouth, though you see its very difficult for her. Even more shockingly, she seems to still be able to speak, though it (naturally) sounds like her mouth is full. “Whath. The. Fuckth.” She says, her tongue’s nipple flashing you everytime her mouth opens, and salvia dripping from her black lips. <br />
<br />
The three of you can only stare silently. Even Cici seems to understand how messed up this is, though she still looks immensely turned on, as does Ricardo. You try to look sympathetic, but the sight of all those jiggling breasts is wrecking havoc on your overstimulated hormones. Kasumi sees you all learing, and falls on the couch, her new butt breasts serving as a cushion. Her orginal breasts are squished between her new ones, and as tears stream down her face, her cheek nipples become erect. As she sobs, she leans back on the couch, her back breasts also cushioning her. “I hathe you!” She says, slamming her fist on the couch, causing all of her breasts to jiggle. She moans in frustration, and as she does, her tongue breast again falls out of her mouth again. She flops on her side, clearly exhausted, embarrassed, and scared. <br />
<br />
The long silence is broken by Ricardo. “Well, I know one way we can try to fix her.” He indicates the Recorder responsible for this mess. You admit he has a point. You could try your luck at it, but you can’t make a wish unless the bottle lands on you. You don’t trust horny Ricardo or drunk Cici to make a responsible wish, but then again, your own hormones are acting up, as well. You ponder your options...</p>
