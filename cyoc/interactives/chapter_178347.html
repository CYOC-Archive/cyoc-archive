<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">School proceeded normally and life was good. You and your girlfriend continued regular sex like 5 times a week, and sometimes multiple times a day. Honestly it was kinda tiring for you, because just as you predicted her libido was in overdrive and didn’t seem to be faltering anytime soon. Luckily you were a hormonal teen who’s sex drive was in top shape so it wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but you still wished that you could just hang out normally with your girlfriend. It was mostly sex every time you hung out with her, but not with you being penetrated. There was no time to train your butt hole being busy with school work and all.<br />
<br />
Anyway you had to volunteer at a place to get hours to improve college prospects, and you choose to volunteer at the genderswap clinic. Reasons being that you would probably learn more about the effects of gender swapping and there being a relaxing work hours, because the beginning of the school year had already passed, so not a ton of gender swapping to be done. <br />
<br />
You’ve only been doing desk work stuff and the occasional heavy lifting of moving supplies here and there, not the actual gender swapping stuff, there were technicians for that. It was peaceful, one or two people would come in a day and some days none at all.<br />
<br />
It was on one of the slower days at the clinic that you met Jennifer Smith, or just Jen, the cheerleader, who was your girlfriend’s mortal enemy. <br />
<br />
“Jen?” you asked surprised, ”What are you doing here?” She should have had her genitals swapped a few weeks ago at the beginning of the school year.<br />
<br />
“Do I know you? OH, you’re that girl’s boyfriend. Well, now that I have a good look at you, you’re pretty cute. Can’t understand why you would go out with her, but returning to your simple question, yes I’m Jen. Don’t be so surprised, I’m sure you’ve heard of me from that girl you call girlfriend, all lies I’m sure of it.”<br />
<br />
“Well she was lying about your looks, that’s for sure, ‘cause you are one smoking babe totally the pinnacle of teen beauty,” she was a looker: thin waist, wide hips, protruding behind, nice c-cups, and a pretty face to top it off, not that your girlfriend didn’t have those points, but every girl is unique and beautiful in their small different ways. <br />
<br />
Now Jen was the one with surprise on her face, “Hm, how thoughtful of you to say that,” she twirled a length of her luxurious locks in her fingers, “ You should know better than to complement other women when you have a girlfriend, especially one who she hates.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t sweat about it, my girlfriend isn’t here right now, plus I make it my duty to treat everyone I meet with respect, unless they are truly hostile. So even with your shape tongue Jen, your words are just words, no harm at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“How interesting, you have thicker skin than that girl, she’s a sensitive one. I can’t do anything around her without her retaliating like I poured milk on her.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah sometimes she’s too sensitive,” you grin as you think about her overactive libido, “Words don’t seem to reach her, when she’s offended, but it rarely happens. So what brings you here Jen?”<br />
<br />
With Jen more relaxed and her having a favorable opinion of you, she explained to you how she was out on vacation cruising the Mediterranean, and had recently come back. Thus she was now here at the gender swap clinic to undergo the mandatory conversion that was mandated by your school’s policies. Doing your job as a volunteer, you explained to her about the papers she needed to fill, and helped her fill out some of them. You then filed those away as the technician took Jen to the back rooms for her procedure. <br />
<br />
About 15 minutes later, Jennifer returned to the waiting room with the tell tale signs, one of which was a funny gait. Another sign was the look of embarrassment, with cheeks red and heavy breathing. The last sign was the cumbersome bulge in her lower wear. Jennifer had clearly not been expecting her new equipment to be massive as it was, and had worn a fashionable strap dress that had stopped at her upper thighs, but now it was tented by the monster she now possessed. You could see her bikini styled panties filled out with her huge round balls, practically spilling out of the legs holes and top. Her panties didn’t cover her dick at all as it’s chub towered over her panty cover balls; it was barely being covered by the skirt of her dress, soon to slip out of the tight cloth. <br />
<br />
It was late in the evening by then, the technician had rushed past Jen’s slow gait, leaving for the night. That meant you were the last one at the clinic and had to lockup when you left, which you hoped was soon, but Jennifer was taking an awfully long time getting to the door, being super distracted by her new schlong. <br />
<br />
“You okay Jennifer?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
A pretty straight forward answer. “So what’s wrong?” you asked as you walked to her.<br />
<br />
“This thing, it won’t go down,” she pulled a little on her skirt only to have it resist with force, “ It’s so alien, like it has a mind of its own. I can’t go out like this.”<br />
<br />
Surely she couldn’t go out like that, public exposure was against the law, plus with her new hormones her cock wouldn’t go down on it’s own any time soon, “ I think I know how to fix this problem, follow me.” You lead her back into the swapping rooms. Rummaging around the cabinets there, you found the condoms they kept for cleanliness purposes. Some people who got penises, men or women, were super sensitive and would make a mess in their clothes upon leaving, thus condoms.<br />
<br />
“Ok sit back there and show me your penis,” you pointed at the operating bed table thing.<br />
<br />
Jennifer compiled, happy to receive help in whatever form. She embarrassedly lifted pulled back her skirt to reveal her beastly fuck rod. It stood haft erect, and you stared in awe at Jennifer’s shaft, because it was a horse cock. She had a huge horse cock with pink flared tip, tube shaped shaft, and darker skinned sheath, the whole package of equine equipment. It slowly grew to a full towering erection of 24 inches by your estimate. Jennifer was clearly uncomfortably horny and embarrassed, turned on by her exposure and your intense stare. <br />
<br />
She was in distress so you went on with your plan as you remembered the facts on gender swapping, animal genitalia were rare occurrences in gender swapping. You unrolled the condom on Jennifer’s meat stick, and started jerking, “You know Jen, you’re pretty lucky to get a horsecock, only .001% of 100,000 people get animal genitalia, so you’re one in 10 of the lucky ones.”<br />
<br />
“Lucky? How is it lucky to become part animal?, ohhh,hmmm, you’re good at this,” She moaned as you pleasured her with experienced hands.<br />
<br />
“Well I think it’s pretty lucky to be unique when everyone is forced to be mundanely the same. You’re special and your differences only make you more charming. Like now this third leg of yours emphasizes your humanity and feminine nature at the same time. You’re beautiful before, and now you’re gorgeous. Beauty and beast all in one woman.”<br />
<br />
You jerked her off in silence after that, unknowing that she looked at you with more deeper feelings. Soon she came like a horse into her condom, filling it to the brim with hot horse seed. You continued to fap her off to get every last rope of cum out, so that she would be fully satisfied and go fully soft.<br />
<br />
Taking off the condom, you threw it into the trash, and grabbed tissues to wipe off Jennifer’s cock. It was pretty cool to see such a length of phallus retreat back all the way into its hidey hole of a sheath. You told Jen how cool it was which made her act more cutely embarrassed.<br />
<br />
You gave her a few tips on how to masturbate at home, emphasizing to use lotion. You gave her your long jacket to help cover up her bottom, as her balls were still prominent under her skirt, and sent her on her way. Volunteering is quite fun at times, you think as you locked up shop and returned home.</p>
