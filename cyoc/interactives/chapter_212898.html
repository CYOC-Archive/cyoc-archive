<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“All Changes Reversed… wait does that mean what I think it means?” Samantha asked,<br />
“Lucky…” Milly sulked, “does that seriously mean you just get to go back to normal?”<br />
“No no, it says in brackets, ‘Player Must Pick up Two Extra Change Cards’,” she clarified, but before she could select her extra cards, she felt her height shoot back up to its original, allowing her to let out a sigh of relief. She felt the fur covering her skin slowly regress back in, revealing her natural skin. Her whiskers regressed into her skin along with her red nose turning back into a human one. Her face shape finally went back to normal and her ears moved back to the side of her head instead of the top of it. Her double tails reconnected into a single before sinking back into her skin. Finally, her six full breasts shrank down to just two of her plain old B cups. <br />
She looked at herself, relieved to be back to normal,<br />
“Don’t get too comfortable, mom,” Mary said,<br />
“I know, I know,” Samantha said, “just taking it in,” she turned over her first change card as she leaned over to grab two more, “Bunny Tail,” she chuckled. A white fluffy ball of a tail popped out the back of her dress right where her last two where, “nice while it lasted,” she chuckled, still trying to be the optimist,<br />
“That tail has got to be the cutest one in this whole game,” Milly said, poking at it, feeling its fluffiness,<br />
“Don’t get too carried away!” Samantha said, sitting herself back down. She turned over the first of her two remaining change cards, “Bimbo Lips,” she read. The table watched as her lips began to swell, growing thicker and thicker before they looked to be the size of a thumb, each, “thith ith going tho be weird…” she mumbled through her thicker pillows, “thinally,” she turned over her last card, “Rethealing Rags (Revealing Rags),”<br />
The table watched as almost instantly her dress split into two, exposing her fair midriff. Her skirt shrank, revealing a lot more of her legs, tightening to give away more of her legs than she was used to. Her top shrank, the sleeves shortening and the neckline lowering to revealing small ounces of her cleavage. From beneath her top, her bra seemed to be changing as well, tightening and squeezing at her chest to make her cleavage even more pronounced. She was now by far showing the least amount of skin at the table,<br />
“Ith I wathn’t confinshed…” she struggled to speak,<br />
“Mom, try and talk with your mouth open more,” Mary suggested,<br />
“O-okay…” she cleared her throat, opening her mouth wider, even naturally making an O shape with her lips, “If I wasn’t convinced before, I’m now very sure this game wasn’t aimed at families,” she joked. The table chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I guess it’s me now,” Mary said. She leaned forward, careful not to suddenly burst a few buttons from her reasonable strained top. She took an action card and a change card, turning over the action card to read, “Last Change Reversed,” she finished. She almost felt relieved, but released she quite liked the feeling of being the sexiest one at the table. Lucky for her, she misunderstood the intention of the card. She started shrinking, getting shorter and shorter until she was only just a few inches taller than her original height. Her body remained the same, if not a little compressed from the sudden height change, “man, I liked being the tallest,” she said, realising she was now shorter than both Jules and Milly, and even her mom now!<br />
“What’s the change card?” Milly asked, wanting to speed along to get to her own changes, hoping it’d give her an opportunity to return to slimness,<br />
“It says…” she turned over her card, “‘Bun in the Oven!’… does that mean…”<br />
“Uh oh,” Samantha said, her worst nightmare being realised.<br />
<br />
Mary felt her already bloated belly shift, her inside moving around as suddenly her stomach began to protrude. It started getting rounder and rounder before POP! Her belly had grown so large that her button up top couldn’t handle it. Then another, and another! The bottom half of her top was completely exposed, showing the whole table her newly impregnated belly. Her breasts laid atop it, perfectly supported by her baby filled belly,<br />
“W-well… at least you’ve got the body to carry it…” Jules joked, trying to ease the tension. Mary did not look pleased. Finally, though she thought it was over, her belly button suddenly popped out, completing her pregnant mother look. She really did have the perfect body to support a baby though.<br />
<br />
“That has totally freaked me out,” Samantha joked, unable to look at her pregnant daughter (who at this rate was probably older than her), “sweetie, it’s your turn now,” she directed to Milly,<br />
“Uhm mom…” Mary said, “I just became pregnant, can I have a minute?” She requested, still taking in the fact that she was eating for two,<br />
“Of course, I’m so sorry. I just… I never wanted to see either of you deal with all this for at least another ten years…”<br />
“O-okay,” Mary said,<br />
“Jules, you go with her to her bedroom,” Samantha suggested, “Milly will take her turn and then we can meet back for Jules to finish,”<br />
“That sounds like a good plan, Samantha,” Jules said, smiling awkwardly as she stood up to help Mary to her bedroom. The two disappeared, closing the door behind them.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, I can’t believe I’m pregnant,” Mary said, still taking it in as she hobbled over to her bed,<br />
“It’s weird looking at you like this, and being taller than you,” Jules joked,<br />
“D-do I look horrible… I never wanted to see myself pregnant, I was so terrified when I was a little girl, I haven’t thought about it in years,”<br />
“Really?” Jules said surprised, then answered her question, “sweetheart, I think you are honestly one of the most gorgeous women in the world. And right now, you are sexy, and this pregnant bump makes you even sexier,”<br />
“Am I normally not sexy?” She asked, looking down,<br />
“I just said you are one of the most gorgeous women in the world. At least in my eyes, and you know my taste in women is great,” she joked,<br />
“I-I know…” Mary giggled, then went silent for a moment, “do you think you could love me forever if I looked like this?”<br />
“Seriously?” Jules asked, “I’d love you for the rest of my life if you were a half-cow!” Jules said, “when I said I wanted to get close to your mom and your sister, I really meant it! I want to be closer to your family because… well I hoped I’d be a part of your family,”<br />
“R-really!?” Mary said, her eyes lighting up,<br />
“Of course!” Jules said, “I might be a buff girl with horns right now, but I still love you just as much as I did before!”<br />
“T-thank you… Jules,” Mary smiled<br />
“Thank you, Mary,” Jules smiled back. She leaned in and kissed her. Mary kissed her back,<br />
“I love you, Jules… Mike… whatever you wanna call yourself, whatever body you have, I love you!” <br />
“I love you too!” Jules said, “but don’t get me wrong, I am not complaining about this body!” She said, placing a hand on Mary’s full breast, causing her to moan a little. The two hesitated,<br />
“How much time do we have?” Mary asked, biting her lip,<br />
“More like how many shirts do you have?” Jules flirted,<br />
“Not enough… but you could always take this one of gently,”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Okay sweetie, you gonna pick up your cards?” Samantha asked Milly right as Jules and Mary shut the door. Sure she wasn’t comfortable with whatever those two would be doing in there, but at the very least she preferred there not being a man involved… plus her daughter was already pregnant, what more could Jules do,<br />
“Why is this game being so unfair to me?” Milly asked, “I don’t mean to just complain all the time but seriously,”<br />
“Milly, you started this game with the best changes of all of us. You got to be an adult and have very large breasts, when I was your age I wouldn’t have wanted anything more!”<br />
“Y-yeah… I guess you’re right,” she hesitated, picking up her two cards in the absence of speaking, “d-do you still see me as your daughter, even though I look like this?”<br />
“Of course I do!” Samantha said as if it was a pointless question, “both you and your sister look very different than you did before this game started, but it’s not like I see you as anything other than my daughters,”<br />
“Thanks mom,” Milly said, smiling softly, she turned over her action card, “Pick Up Extra Change Card,”<br />
“Interesting!” Samantha said, trying her best to spice up the game,<br />
“It’s whatever, probably won’t be anything too exciting,” Milly said. She turned over her first change card as she leaned over to grab another, “Expanding Silicone?” She said, “wait like…”<br />
“Implants…” Samantha said with a look of disappointment, “this game really is made for a different audience…”<br />
<br />
Milly sat back and watched as her already large breasts sitting atop her padded belly lifted and firmed up. A portion of the fat behind them seemed to morph into a silicone implant, making her breasts more round. After they finally changed, the breasts began to inflate slightly larger. Milly couldn’t help but giggle as it tickled a little, <br />
“I think these are a little too big now…” Milly said,<br />
“A little?” Samantha questioned,<br />
“Y-yeah… I wanted to see what it’d be like having really big boobs, but these are a little too big than I was hoping for,”<br />
“I have to agree sweetie… I think they were too big after the first round,” Samantha chuckled uncomfortably, “you still have a second card,”<br />
“Oh right,” Milly said, just about to turn it over.<br />
<br />
Just before she could speak, both Mary and Jules walked out of the bedroom, reentering the room, “hey,” Mary said, “what change did you get?” She asked, looking at her sister, unable to tell much of a difference,<br />
“I think it was bigger… y’know,” Jules said, pointing to Milly’s chest,<br />
“Oh my god!” Mary said, mouth open, “they’ve gotta be bigger than mine by now,”<br />
“They’re not natural,” Milly said,<br />
“What?” Mary asked, looking to Samantha,<br />
“They’re implants, actually,” she clarified,<br />
“Wow… plastic surgery and a pregnancy, this is a nightmare for you, huh,” she joked,<br />
“You have no idea…” Samantha said, looking very uncomfortable, “but at least it’s just a game,”<br />
<br />
Milly turned over her last card as Mary and Jules sat down,<br />
“So do we know what happens at the end of this game?” Mary asked, then realised, “wait, do we know how to end this game?”<br />
“Yeah I asked the guy who sold it to me,” Jules said, “all we have to do is pick up a ‘Game Over’ card,”<br />
“Seriously?” Milly said, “so we could be playing this forever!?”<br />
“Well I mean, it’s not like we can’t leave,” Jules explained, “nothing is stopping us from going outside other than our changes. I can’t exactly go to the mall with horns,”<br />
“So we can leave?” Samantha asked,<br />
“Yeah, but it’s not worth it until we finish the game,<br />
“I agree, and my second change is…” she turned over her card, “Bunny Teeth,”<br />
She opened her mouth, inviting everyone to watch as her two front teeth extended forwards, giving her an overbite and even making her teeth slightly wider as well.<br />
<br />
“So what do you win if you pull the Game Over card?” Samantha asked, “is there a prize or just reset all of us back to normal?”<br />
“I think it was something like ‘Player is Granted a Wish’ or something. I did ask but I’ve kinda forgotten,”<br />
“Alright, so we get a wish if we win. What do we wish for?” Milly asked<br />
“Well obviously if we aren’t returned back to normal, we wish for all of back to normal,” Samantha said,<br />
“Yeah, I agree with that,” Jules said, “but if not… can we be selfish with our wish?” Mary asked,<br />
“In what way would you be selfish?” Samantha asked,<br />
“N-no I haven’t got any ideas,” Mary said, “I just mean does it have to benefit everyone here? Or just me… and Jules,”<br />
“That’s fair!” Milly said, “I already know what I’m gonna wish for!”<br />
“Don’t think you can wish away your childhood as soon as this game is over,”<br />
“No, I just have a good idea…” Milly said, “it’s whatever,” she said, a bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Okay, well I have my last card,” Jules said reaching over, “let’s hope it’s a Game Over I guess,” she chuckled. She turned over the action card, “Card Applies to Player on Left,”<br />
“Me!” Milly said, “I really hope it’s not bad…” she said,<br />
“Me too…” Jules said to herself, knowing if she messed with Milly’s body any more she’d hate her for life. She hesitantly turned over the card, letting out a sigh of relief, “Red Headed Locks,”<br />
Everyone watched as Milly’s hair shifted in colour from the roots, spreading down from her original natural blonde colour to a bright orage ginger.<br />
<br />
“Not bad sis, it suits you,” Mary said,<br />
“Thanks!”<br />
“And we’re back to start again,” Samantha said, “this round, we all need to hope this can end. I think I’ve had my fix of this game now,”<br />
“Me too…” Jules said,<br />
“I don’t want it to end, but if it means I get to go back to being skinny I’ll be happy!” Milly jumped in,<br />
“Yeah, I think I’m good not being pregnant for a while,” Mary finished.<br />
Samantha leaned over and grabbed an Action Card and a Change Card, ready to (hopefully) finish the game soon.</p>
