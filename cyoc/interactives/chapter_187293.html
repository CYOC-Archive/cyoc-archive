<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty&#39;s body was unable to move from the Willow&#39;s roots, its bark gripping his skin as he wriggled, now desperately trying to escape his wooden prison, but then as if to add to his bad situation he jumped at the distant sound of thunder, the sound of a mighty storm on the winds, the trees began to shake as the breeze turned into a mighty gale, the gusts coming and going like the beating of a heartbeat....or wings.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ty&#39;s heart and breath came to a standstill, the wind had stopped and the sky above had turned dark, the sound of a mighty breath taking its place, Ty became as still as stone with fear as he gazed up at what used to be the sky, but was now replaced by a giant gaping maw, its teeth as big as swords and many in number, the light of thunder bolts dancing between each tooth, Ty&#39;s infant body let out an instinctively whimper out of fear as he closed his eyes, awaiting the mighty jaws to consume and end him, yet it never came, Ty opened his eyes to see one of the dragons teeth a Meare few inches from his  face, wincing as the electrical charge from the dragons mouth ran through his body.<br />
<br />
The next thing Ty knew, the mighty Willow&#39;s wood began to groan and creak as it rumbled forth from the ground, its roots suddenly coming to life as they wove themselves into a round basket around Ty&#39;s small body, a blanket of moss them began to grow from the Willow&#39;s roots, covering up to Ty&#39;s chest, encircling and wrapping his small and frail body in its gentel warmth, Ty simply lay there, clutching his new blanket of moss in his small hands as his mind began to match his body, his mentality growing younger and younger as the beat of the dragons wings lulled him into a deep sleep.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
His name was Thunder, a mighty beast of the sky and Storms, a beast of ancient times when the world was young, a creature that had witnessed the birth of every other species to walk the earth, soar the skies and Channel the oceans, the dragons were a proud and mighty race, yet knew that they were as mortal as any other creature, and a dragon such as Thunder knew that all too well, He was the ultimate of his kind, the alpha dragon, guardian of the sky and ultimate ruler of the fey world, elfs, witches, warlocks, wyvern, centaurs satyrs and other creatures of the fey all looked up at him and his kind with awe and respect, and that whent double for Thunder, every beat of his wings was like the heartbeat of the sky, the crackling and sparking of the lightning through his white fur  that ran down his back and accross his chest was his song, and his roar?, that was as if the sky was passing down its furious judgment, rattling the earth and the sky, his dark black claws were every enemies end, for when they gazed into their darkness they knew that they would soon turn red with their own blood, his sky blue scales were his armour, as if carved from the sky itself, every scale serving its purpose, but then there was his eyes, his left eye was golden like fire, his pupil dark and narrow as it gazed at the ground below, but his right eye?, was grey and blank, a deep red burn accross his face from his last fight, when Giles had defended the relm of the fey from the human nations.<br />
<br />
But none of that mattered now, for this was a special day, his Queen was finally ready for the last component of their nest, a dryad to keep their nest pure and their young protected, the tree he how gently held in his jaws was to be that dryad, he then chuckled deeply, his voice rattling the clouds as he flew past as he looked at the glowing woman who sat on the end of his nose, humming to herself as she kicked her feet back and forth as they flew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you again dryad, you don&#39;t know how long we have waited for this day&quot; spoke thunder, yet his lips never moved, no dragons did, their voice came from their element, and the sky was Thunders voice, his words seeming to come from every direction, the dryad then stood up and bend down now facing Thunders eye, tilting her head to the side to get a better look, being as his eyes were much like what the humans mockingly called a komodo dragon as she smiled at him &quot;it is my honor your majesty, any of my sisters would feel the same way, and I do so look forward to joining you and the queen in welcoming your young into the world&quot; said the dryad with a smile before she sat back down atop his nose.<br />
<br />
Then rapidly approaching they saw their destination, a mountain that peirced the skies sticking straight up into the air, clouds encircling it like rings around its stone structure, the calls of many different dragons and Wyverns echoing from caves and ledges all over the mountain, But thunders destination was the large cave that he himself had carved out almost at the verry top, where his Queen was waiting for him.......</p>
