<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn&#39;t until I&#39;d dropped off my books and closed my locker that I realized Claire had followed me from the social studies room.  She was standing nearby, books clasped in front of her and her head bowed to look at her feet.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you want something?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;I, I came to see what you&#39;d like for lunch, M-Master.&quot;  She was blushing furiously and trembling.<br />
I glanced around, but no one seemed to be paying us any attention. <br />
&quot;Follow me.&quot; I said and walked away from the lockers area.  I silently wished I knew what was going on with her, and suddenly remembered what I&#39;d said to her: &#39;I wish you&#39;d stop carping and get into character&#39; She was acting out the housemaid role assigned to her!<br />
I slipped into an empty classroom, closing the door softly after Claire.  She stood nearby in the darkened room in much the same pose as before, her knuckles white on her textbooks.<br />
&quot;Set your books down.&quot; I told her.<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; She said quietly, and leaned over to set the books at her feet, giving me a perfect view down her blouse as she did so.<br />
&quot;Now tell me, why are you doing this?&quot;  I was honestly curious how she&#39;d respond.<br />
&quot;I, I want to serve you well Master, so our plantation does well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Claire, we&#39;re not in class any more, so you don&#39;t have to act like that.&quot;  She snapped her head up to stare at me. &quot;Unless you you want to that is,&quot; I smiled at her. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t object to having the smartest girl in our grade being submissive to me.&quot;<br />
She frowned and took a couple steps back.  &quot;I bet you would.&quot;  She crossed her arms and rubbed herself as if she was chilled by the thought.<br />
&quot;Seriously Claire, what happened to &#39;I won&#39;t acknowledge you exist outside this assignment&#39;?&quot; I asked her.<br />
&quot;It was, it was like, after you told me to get in character a switch flipped in my head, and even though I knew I was a girl in high school I found myself thinking as if I really were a slave on a Southern plantation, and you were my owner, my Master.&quot;  She turned away &quot;Jesus christ! If you&#39;d told me to I&#39;d have gone and bought you lunch and frikken served it to you.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re okay now, right?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Okay now?  How am I supposed to be okay not knowing if something I hear is going to flip that switch again? No, Andy, I am not okay.&quot;  She wiped at her face and I realized she was crying.<br />
&quot;You watched the Avengers movie, right?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Really, really, not needing distracting right now, thank you very much.&quot; Claire snapped.<br />
&quot;No, remember when Bruce Banner tells them how he tamed the Hulk?&quot; I said excitedly. &quot;The answer isn&#39;t being afraid of the switch, it&#39;s leaving it slightly on all the time to keep it from turning on fully without your control.&quot;<br />
She was still for several breaths then started chuckling.<br />
&quot;Claire?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you know what my packet says?  In week three if I&#39;m still owned by &#39;Master Johnson&#39; I become pregnant out of wedlock.  It doesn&#39;t actually say I&#39;m your mistress, but I&#39;m sure as hell not putting out for &#39;Tom&#39;, and it talks about all the little perks and gifts I get as a household maid.&quot; She turned back to face me.  &quot;So I&#39;m not so sure I want to be &#39;slightly&#39; your fuck toy all the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;d enjoy it too much.&quot; I said.<br />
&quot;Like Hell Rodgers!&quot; She shouted.<br />
We both froze, looking at the door, and I quickly wished no one heard her outburst.<br />
She whispered loudly, as if to make up for shouting.  &quot;You are so full of yourself, have you even gotten to second base?  I&#39;ve never heard of you so much as dating anyone.&quot; <br />
&quot;Not enjoy the sex thing, though I think I&#39;d surprise you.&quot; I wiggled my eyebrows and she scowled at me.  &quot;You can&#39;t resist the idea of setting aside all the pressure to be the smartest, most perfect goody-two shoes and let someone else be responsible for making your decisions.&quot;  Her scowl deepened, but she didn&#39;t interrupt me.  &quot;You probably daydream about being whisked off to Narnia or Oz and never having to worry about your GPA or what adults will think of you!&quot;  She crossed her arms and looked away.<br />
&quot;Pandemic.  I imagine surviving the pandemic and building a new life with the survivors.&quot; She admitted.<br />
&quot;And with some well-hung stud who&#39;s happy to father baby after baby on you?&quot; I asked.<br />
She glanced at me, then away again and smiled. &quot;Sometimes, but usually the men are left mostly sterile, so I get to try them all out before settling into motherhood.&quot;<br />
&quot;Heh, harem fantasy huh?  Nothing wrong with that.&quot;<br />
I sat down in a chair, and after a bit Claire came and sat across from me.<br />
&quot;How, how would we make this work?&quot; Claire asked.  &quot;I mean, I think you flipped the switch back off, but I can&#39;t tell.&quot;<br />
&quot;Easy enough to check,&quot; I said. &quot;Show me your tits.&quot;<br />
Claire stared at me in shock, her mouth dropping open. &quot;Andy!&quot; She hissed.<br />
I glanced down to see she had her fingers on the buttons of her shirt.  When I glanced back up she was blushing and biting her lower lip.<br />
&quot;Damn you Rodgers!&quot; She muttered as she looked at the door, swiftly unbuttoning her blouse.  &quot;If anyone catches us I&#39;m going to say you slipped me some E.&quot;<br />
I watched quietly as she pulled her shirt open and leaned forward, pulling her long hair out of the way.  She was wearing a pastel pink satin bra and tiny gold cross pendant which swung out and back between us.<br />
&quot;Why Ms Meadows, I didn&#39;t know you were religious?&quot; I reached out to catch her pendant, then pulled lightly on the chain. <br />
Claire licked her lips, and shrugged her blouse off, reaching behind her back as she knelt on the floor in front of me.  I brushed my knuckles against her out-thrust cleavage, willing myself to become erect.  She dropped her arms to her sides, trapping her unhooked bra in place. I raised my hand to her chin and tipped her head back.  She closed her eyes as I leaned down and kissed her, wishing for the kind of deeply passionate, sensual kiss that drives women wild.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t notice when she finished taking her bra off.  I didn&#39;t notice how we would up lying beside eachother on the classroom floor.  I didn&#39;t notice when she got my pants open, because all that time we were sharing the most intense kiss I&#39;d ever had.  When we finally separated to catch our breath Claire&#39;s hands were wrapped around the shaft of my penis, gently squeezing me, and I had my arms around her buried in her hair. She was crying, so I leaned forward and kissed the tears away. She sniffled and leaked a few more.<br />
&quot;I never,&quot; &lt;sniff&gt; &quot;never thought kisses like that,&quot; &lt;sniff&gt; &quot;were real!&quot; She said.<br />
I ran my fingers through her hair and rubbed her back. She closed her eyes and tucked her forehead against my chest. I continued rubbing her back, and she started actively giving me a handjob.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing this.&quot; Claire whispered. &quot;I mean, you tell me out of the blue to show you my tits, and it&#39;s not like I was angry or afraid, I was thrilled!  I knew what my Master wanted, and it was something I could do and it would please him, you?  Whatever, and I never even considered saying no.&quot;  She looked up at me.  &quot;I ought to be terrified, but I&#39;m, I&#39;m happy I can make you happy.&quot;  She licked her lips and kissed me again.  It was every bit as intense the second time, and somewhere in there the rest of Claire&#39;s clothes came off.  I did notice when she lowered herself onto my cock, because our lips weren&#39;t touching for a few moments. But she held my face still between her palms as she arched her back, pushing down until her crotch pressed wetly against mine.  She moaned deep in her throat and we resumed our passionate kissing as she slid herself up and down my shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Master!  Am I tight enough for you Master? She was rocking back and forth as she bobbed, her tits slapping against her chest.   I grunted and drove up into her each time she came down. I grabbed her knees and spread them squeezing in time with her bouncing and grunting and grinning like a fool: Claire Meadows, class valedictorian was riding my bone and asking me if she was doing a good enough job of it!  I started squeezing and thrusting faster and she picked up the pace to match, droplets of sweat flying from her breasts.<br />
<br />
I wished we&#39;d cum together, and it would be the most amazing orgasm either of us had ever experienced.  Claire pulled me up and wrapped her legs around my back.  I got my hands under her ass and lifted as she pushed down on my shoulders, her tits bouncing and flopping in my face as we rushed to climax. Claire started to scream as she came, then bent down and bit me on the shoulder, muffling her cries as waves of ecstasy flowed through her, and streams of my jizz flowed into her.  We held eachother, panting and shaking, bodies covered in chill sweat.  Eventually Claire leaned back, her fingers laced behind my neck and arched her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here are my tits, Master, would you like me to show you anything else?&quot;  She was smiling as she said it, and I could feel her pulse speed up.  I willed myself to stay erect, and brought my hands up to cup her breasts, squeezing them gently before caressing them with my finger tips.  Claire&#39;s pupils were dilated and she started clenching herself around my shaft, squeezing with her pussy the way she had before giving me a hand job.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d prefer you call me Andy, when we&#39;re not acting in class.&quot; I leaned forward and gently licked, then nibbled on her breast. &quot;We both know you&#39;ll mean &#39;Master&#39; when you say it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes Andy, whatever you want Andy.&quot;<br />
I leaned her back until I was lying on top of her. &quot;Now lets see if we can&#39;t do a bit better this time, hmm?&quot; I asked as we began fucking in earnest.</p>
