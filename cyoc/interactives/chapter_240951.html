<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m kinda getting hungry so let&#39;s go eat!&quot; his mother said excitedly and Jeff nodded in agreement. &quot;Sure, I&#39;m getting hungry too&quot; Jeff admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm perhaps I should have waited until after we had dinner to become a baby&quot; she replied with a bit of a frown, second guessing her previous spontaneous action to regress herself.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head, &quot;It&#39;s alright. It just means it&#39;ll be our first activity together as babies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brightening up at her son understanding she then grinned deviously, &quot;In that case...race ya downstairs&quot; she said before dashing out of the room with the sound of crinkling trailing behind her. Blinking once in surprise Jeff felt a sense of competitiveness rise up inside him before eagerly chasing after his toddler mother with a grin and crinkling of his own.<br />
<br />
Reaching the stairs both found the baby gates at the top and bottom were thankfully open, allowing them to continue their race. However they did slow down as they cautiously descended the steps though shoving each other a little as they tried to take the lead. His mom managed to stay in front the whole time though, practically shoving her padded butt in his face. So it came as no surprise when they reached the landing that she toddled into the kitchen first. He would have been more upset with losing if it wasn&#39;t for the fact they ran right into their babysitter for the night.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulped as recognized her as Emily, a blonde haired teenager from school who also lived in their neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Emily who was cooking at the stove, looked down at the pair of toddlers standing at her feet with a friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah there you two are. You&#39;re right on time Jeff and Janet as I just finished your guy&#39;s dinner&quot; Emily remarked with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Hearing someone use his mother&#39;s name was new to Jeff, but appropriate. In fact he should probably start using it from now on now that they were in the company of adults.<br />
<br />
&quot;But before I feed you I got to check both your diapers to see if either of you needs a change&quot; Emily said and without waiting for a response kneeled down before feeling their padding with her hands. Both he and his mother blushed at the invasion of privacy, though he did moreso given the diaper check was being done by a former classmate. Thankfully it was over quickly as Emily had a disappointed look on her face. &quot;Huh you&#39;re both still clean. Well that&#39;ll change eventually, but for now it&#39;s dinner time!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then began removing and taking off their shirts likely so they wouldn&#39;t get them messy while they ate. Jeff allowed his to come off without much fuss but when Emily did his mom&#39;s he instinctively averted his gaze. Then he remembered that his mother was a toddler  now and had nothing to show. This proved true when he looked and saw she had a flat chest just like a boy. He was relieved until realizing he would eventually see her naked when it came time for her to be changed, a thouhht that made him only slightly uncomfortable. Now in nothing but their diapers the two were lifted up and gently deposited into a set of highchair and a bib placed around their neck. The moment they were set down Jeff and Janet discovered a perk of their disposable padding in that it cushioned their rears from the hard plastic seat, both smiling at the feeling.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later a bowl of steaming hot mac n&#39; cheese was placed in front of them. At first Emily allowed them to feed themselves...with somewhat disastrous results. Jeff for the most part tried to eat with his poorly developed motor control and managed to keep the mess contained to his bib. His mom on the other hand didn&#39;t seem to try all that hard, and got cheese smeared around her mouth and parts of her arms and chest. &quot;Okay I think that enough of letting of you try&quot; Emily laughed as she confiscated their utensils before taking a couple of minutes to clean up his mother with a wet paper towel. The meal then resumed with Emily spoon feeding them what was left in their bowl. His mother once again proved to be more receptive of the treatment, the baby girl happily opening her mouth for each bite offered to her. Once their bowl were empty and their bellies full Emily removed their bibs and returned the toddlers to the floor. Wondering why she wasn&#39;t giving them their shirts back he got his answer by what she said next.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll let the two of you go about in just your diapers for the rest of the night since you&#39;re just so cute in them&quot; Emily cooed at the pair, Jeff lightly blushing and his mom giggling softly. Both had no problems with that as they preferred their clothing only be their padding as they found they felt more free wearing just that.<br />
<br />
While Emily was busy taking care of the dishes in the sink his mother leaned in close to whisper to him, &quot;Wasn&#39;t that fun Jeff? When she fed us at the end I really felt like a baby again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah...it was great&quot; Jeff replied with a fake smile, hiding the fact his experience hadn&#39;t been as good as hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m starting to really enjoy this&quot; she confessed.<br />
<br />
When Emily returned she decided to...</p>
