<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still with your eyes closed, you sluggishly wake up the next day. You feel surprisingly well, given all that happened the day before. Though your ass hurts a bit, still, it feels sore in a good kind of way. Then you realize what is making you feel so good: your four inch cock is standing at full mast, pulsating and demanding your attention. Fuck, you&#39;ve never felt this hard in your whole life! You grab your cock lazily. It&#39;s not much of a cock, standing really thin, with a small head. You&#39;ve always felt kinda embarrassed about it. Not that anyone would know, really. At the age of 22, you&#39;ve never built up the confidence to go after sex. And it also hadn&#39;t made much of a difference, as you&#39;ve seldom felt a horniness quite like this. <br />
As you move your hands to your crotch, you freeze, feeling an uncanny weight. You shift around your bed and grab your balls. Oh fuck. You hadn&#39;t payed much attention yesterday, but now you sit in your bed, lift the bedsheets and stare at what has been done to your crotch. Your new balls are humongous, about the size of  lemons! Your eyes open wide as your new alien balls visibly pulsate, churning out your new sperm and producing new hormones. You see that overnight, they changed your sack a bit, as it appears to be much more wrinkled and hung quite a bit lower than what you were used to. Yesterday, you had a really tight scrotum, and your balls would sometimes spontaneously ride up. Though your puberty was done, you didn&#39;t have much in the way of pubic hair, only stray hairs, soft hairs that didn&#39;t form a bush at all. What you do realize, though, is that your new balls were sweating quite a bit. In fact, they seemed to be hotter than the rest of your body, which was unusual. As you look closer, you see that the skin in your sack is deeply red, almost as if it was inflaming. You feel a bit freaked out, as you realize your cock is purple with so much blood shot into it, the head aching as your tissue stretch to accommodate all this blood. <br />
You see the central vein riding your cock is freakishly bloated, and many other veins are ingurgitated. It felt good, but it was also a bit painful. As you ask yourself what was going on, an instinct crossed your mind, almost as if your balls responded to your cue. Your crotch&#39;s bloodwork was being rebuilt in order to better serve Jack&#39;s balls, creating new vessels to nourish them, to collect your new bucketloads of testosterone. This idea made your cock throb. Yeah, making Jack&#39;s balls big and strong, filled with powerful seed!<br />
Jack&#39;s balls? No, wait, these were your balls, stuck to your body! And you weren&#39;t Jack! Your mind felt a bit hazy. &quot;I&#39;m not Jack.&quot; You say it out loud, reassuring yourself. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; and blank filled your mind. What was your name? You feel your balls churning intensely, and a thought invaded your mind. &quot;Jack.&quot; What? Of course not. Jack was your dirty, hunky, sexy friend. A hunk of a man! Violent and horny. And you were just some wimp, right? Your balls twitched again. &quot;Jack&quot;. You looked at your underwhelming body, frail, with almost no muscles, fat, no mass to speak of, devoid of any body hair whatsoever. This couldn&#39;t be right. <br />
But then, a familiar scent wafted through the air to your nose. Though faint, you recognized it immediately. It was the unmistakeable smell from Jack&#39;s crotch! You bring your hands to your nose. Sure enough, your new sweaty sack were kickstarting a musky, kinky smell. You let out a horny smile, feeling oddly proud. Heck yeah, that was your manly smell! Just the thought of it made your cock throb again and your balls pulled down heavy. <br />
&quot;Jack... off!&quot; You felt the command of your loins fiercely. Moving your hands to your cock, you start jacking off violently. Thoughts invaded your mind. You wanted to breed. Shoot your seed into this world, and make any hole in your way yours for the fucking. Fuck yeah! Just then, you felt another scent coming to your sensitive nose. This one was rank, and smelled stale. You realize, from the wetness of your armpits, that you were producing some nasty body odor. You dive your nose into them, feeling oddly earthed in Jack&#39;s scents. Your scents. Fuck, anyone who smelled that would know what you were capable of. <br />
Your cock was throbbing and you felt your cum shooting up your groins. You moan at the feeling, this was the best orgasm you had ever had. Twitching your pelvic muscles, you expect to see cum flooding out of your puny cock... but it didn&#39;t! Instead, you shot your cum inwards, and you felt them making something new inside of you, at the base of your groin. Fuck, your pelvis seemed so heavy and loaded, what was going on? Your balls twitch, and you instinctively know the answer. Your cum storage had just tripled! You feel your new seminal vesicles creeping up inside of you, building up your precious cum. Your muscles continue to spasm, trying to get it out, but your seed had other plans. The whole process repeats itself, and you realize you&#39;re making a second pair of seminal vesicles inside you. Fuck, your loins were flooding with cum at this point, and after spasming for two whole minutes, you finally feel get your release! <br />
Cum was shooting everywhere! There was too much of it! As you ejaculate, you realize your dick was too thin to keep up with the volume! You grunt in pain, forcing your cum out with pressure, as your balls churn out violently. Amazingly, your cock begins to thicken before your very eyes, adjusting to the very sizable load you were shooting all over yourself. Tough still thin, you could feel with awe the ruthlessness of your balls yearning to change this body to a better breeder. You know whenever you cum, they would adapt and change you insidiously. <br />
You smile, happy with yourself. Looking down at the mess of sweat and cum you made, you realized that was what you wanted to do for the rest of your life. Fuck work. Fuck your family, and fuck the old you. You were Jack, and you were gonna cum.</p>
