<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some of these options were things Oliver hadn&#39;t even contemplated - Bodybuilder, Milf, even Supermodel. Then his eyes fell on it and he muttered the words under his breath. &quot;Porn star?&quot; Well, if he wanted to be something different for a few hours, that was definitely an interesting choice, he thought. He hesitated a moment over the option, then finally clicked it. He quickly went through the confirmation popups without reading them before he lost his nerve.<br />
<br />
At last &#39;Initializing Change&#39; appeared on the screen in the upper corner and the screen filled with a view of him, though only from the chest up. His eyes flicked up to his webcam and of course the view of him did the same. He pushed away from his desk a little so more of him was in view. &quot;I hope it&#39;s not recording this..&quot; He sat back in his chair, his skin suddenly feeling warm. He felt silly sitting there naked staring at a spinning loading icon on his computer.<br />
<br />
He shifted in his seat uncomfortably. When was this thing going to start? He adjusted the way he was sitting again, and finally noticed it wasn&#39;t anxious fidgeting. He was shifting the way he sat as his body grew, looking at himself on the screen the top of his head was inching towards the top of the computer screen. Looking down he stretched out longer legs and arms. He sprang to his feet, his stomach and chest filling the computer monitor as he stood. His head swam a little from his new vantage point. He stretched his arms over his head and his hands brushed the ceiling. He had to be over six feet tall, now.<br />
<br />
It was the display of lean muscles on the computer monitor that made him look down again. His chest stuck out slightly, and his stomach was lean and taught, the hint of definition starting to appear between abs. Even his arms and legs were beginning to show a little definition.<br />
<br />
Examining his own body had his cock pointing stiffly away from his crotch. It had never felt so hard, like it was still straining to get bigger, plumping past erect and on to something else. He wrapped a now bigger hand around his shaft, expecting it to feel smaller in his larger hand, but it still felt like it had. It was hard to tell if it was bigger against his larger body, but it must be.<br />
<br />
He dropped back into the chair, the motioning taking his back a bit so the monitor now showed him sitting there, holding his cock in his hand, a pleased smile on.. was that his face? It had lost much of the youthful softness. Somehow it looked like him, even though it didn&#39;t at all. His cheekbones were more pronounced, and his jaw was wide and squared. His red hair was thick and wavy, pushed back from his handsome, freckled face. His lips seemed fuller and his brows heavier.  He looked like an adult.<br />
<br />
He eyed his own self on the monitor like he was watching porn, though a porno where the guys muscles swelled slightly with each pump of his cock. He gripped one now well-defined pectoral with his free hand, flexing the muscles under his fingers with a grin. He had to adjust his grip on his cock as it continued to slowly grow between his fingers, the mushroom head sticking up a good couple inches over his fist now with his hand at the base of his cock.<br />
<br />
He flexed his other arm for the camera, a cocky smile crossing his face at the way the muscles seemed to pop. Though one thick, red eyebrow went up at the bush of coppery hair that grew from his pit. Around the base of his cock his pubes were fuller as well, though trimmed short. Short, coppery-red fur started growing from the middle of his chest, along the bottom of his pecs and up his stomach between his six pack. There was even itching on his jaw as scruff grew in on his chiseled features.<br />
<br />
And his cock.. It was getting to be too much for one hand so he moved his other down to it, double fisting what must have been at least ten inches. He eagerly bucked his hips, sliding his cock through his clenched fists as his round, muscular ass bounced in his chair. With a grunt, the pillar of cock in his hands twitched and launched a glob of cum right into the air. Twice, three times, four.. the sixth dribbled down the side of his cock and he reached over to his laundry to grab a sock and wipe himself clean.<br />
<br />
He turned to look at himself in the computer screen. Staring back was a man in his mid-twenties, over six feet tall with a sculpted but leanly muscled physique. His coppery body hair was trimmed short and accented his fair, freckled skin just enough to cover his pecs and making an enticing red line down to a magnificent cock. Even as it softened it sat fat and heavy between his thighs, at least eight inches while soft and matched with a pair of egg-sized balls.<br />
<br />
His computer dinged a few times and Oliver thought it might have been the Chronivac. But then he blinked at the screen. There was a char going up one side, and the dings were coming from donations.. It was a camera sharing app that was up and people were watching! There was a moment of panic that welled up inside of him before it subsided. Of course he was filming himself jerking off for cash, that&#39;s what he did between more pro shoots.<br />
<br />
His eyes scanned some of the messages coming in, suggestions on things to do, encouragements, the usual compliments. He grinned at the screen. &quot;Glad you guys enjoyed the show, but I think that&#39;s it for now. Might be back on later.&quot; His voice was deep and smooth, slightly husky. He could still remember being Oliver the awkward geek, but Oliver the porn star seemed to be foremost in his mind.  Cool, confident, and definitely an exhibitionist. He gave his floppy cock one last bounce before he shut off his program.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t thought of it until he saw the Chronivac program still running on his computer and sighed. &quot;Well, at least I have my way back.&quot; He frowned, though, why did he suddenly have what he needed to do camera shows? The camera on his computer looked better than the one he had at the beginning of the evening.<br />
<br />
Then he took a moment to look around the room. It wasn&#39;t his bedroom, or it was, but not the one he was used too. His science awards and comics were gone, and the room was distinctly more adult, with a large queen bed he could even point the camera at if he wanted. Bookshelves were on one wall, and some free weights sat off to the side waiting to be used. It was like the world changed to accommodate the new him.<br />
<br />
He stood and walked out of his room into an apartment he did but did not recognize. Although he had never seen it before, he also knew he had lived here for years. Oliver scratched at the stubble on his jaw as he thought about what to do next. He didn&#39;t think his parents being home in a few hours would be a problem anymore, unless he undid this..</p>
