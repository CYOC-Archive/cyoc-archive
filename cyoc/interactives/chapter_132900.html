<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen stood up and dragged her bag out the front door as it closed itself behind her. Walking along the path to the bus was proving to be difficult, since her legs were very short and she had what was now massive weights on both sides of her body. As she approached the bus, she glanced in the window and locked eyes with Kevin, a member of the schools track team. Kevin was not a nice person at all, he was a complete womanizer, there were very few women in their year that he hadn&#39;t had sex with. Before her transformation, Jen had been one of those women. But in this altered reality she was quite the outcast because of her looks and seemingly slutty personality.<br />
<br />
The instant Jen saw Kevin she felt an intense feeling of lust completely overtake her, thanks to the effects of the curse, she was now madly in love with Kevin. She stumbled up the bus&#39;s steps and walked along the aisle to where Kevin was sitting, her breathing heavy as she meekly said &quot;H-hi Kevin... Can I sit next to you? Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin rolled his eyes and said &quot;Sure, whatever Jen...&quot; He moved his bag off of the spare seat and Jen, trying to contain her excitement, immediately scrambled up onto the seat, due to her haste, she had caused her already ill fitting cheerleader skirt to flip up, exposing her proportionally large ass to the entire bus.<br />
<br />
 In this reality, Jen was only an honorary cheer team member, since all of the girls didn&#39;t like hanging around with her, she was let into the school as an inclusion thing. But during cheer practice she would just sit on the sidelines and stare intently at the practicing football team.<br />
<br />
Through the entire bus journey, Jen never stopped staring at any part of Kevin. Every bump the bus went over caused Jen to quietly moan in pleasure as her assets jiggled around in her tight clothes. Kevin would be lying if he said it wasn&#39;t kinda turning him on when he looked down. He thought maybe he would take advantage of Jen, since all he saw her as now was a fat ball of sex. <br />
<br />
When the bus arrived at school Kevin had to practically force Jen to get out of the way, when he scooched past her he leant down and whispered in her ear &quot;Meet me in the boys changing room after third period.&quot; Just hearing him whisper in her ear made Jen have to use all her self restraint from moaning. She waited for everyone else to get off the bus before jumping down from her seat, the seat now had an unsightly stain from where Jen was sitting. Normally she would be panicking about going to school as her new form, but every time she tried to think about anything, Kevin was the only thing she could focus on. While she let her thoughts wander she barely realised that she had already finished the first 2 lessons of the day. Obviously getting no work done, only chewing through an entire pencil out of sexual frustration. <br />
<br />
Third period seemed to drag on endlessly, the anticipation building up inside of her made every moment seem like hours. She couldn&#39;t wait, a small doubt in the back of her mind told her this was wrong, this isn&#39;t how she should be acting. Mini-Jen was her own person now, and the old Jen was now just a passenger in this tiny body. The bell finally rang for the end of third period. Jen left her bag in class and ran as fast as her legs would let her down to the boys changing rooms as she pushed open the door. Kevin swung a changing stall door open and beckoned Jen over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come over here, now.&quot; Kevin demanded. Normally such a forceful demand from a lover would turn Jen off instantly. But Mini-Jen was too horny to care, she skipped over to Kevin -making her boobs almost bounce free from her top- and tried to undo his belt. He stopped her and said &quot;Climb up and sit on the bench, I&#39;m not gonna kneel down to fuck you...&quot; Jen couldnt speak, if she tried all that would come out were pleasured moans. <br />
<br />
After she climbed onto the bench she sat and took off her panties, then spread her legs as wide as she could. &quot;You better be on the pill, you little slut...&quot; Kevin said in a very demeaning tone. Almost instantly as Kevin entered her, Jen began to orgasm, it was nothing like she had felt before, it felt like every thrust caused the orgasm to start all over again. before long she could barely think at all, pleasure taking over her consciousness. She began to drool all down her face, if Kevin had seen this he would&#39;ve probably stopped at that, despite not finishing. But one single droplet of Jens spit managed to thread its way past her large chest, and drip right onto Kevins penis. <br />
<br />
Kevin barely noticed since he was close to climaxing, but after every thrust his dick and balls were shrinking into nothing. Just before the moment of climax his crotch was left completely empty, he looked down to see and instantly reached his hands down to check it out, panicking while he felt a completely flat section of skin where his dick used to be, he got a sensation that felt like a massive kick to his taint. <br />
The pain of this made him black out onto the floor. <br />
<br />
When he awoke he saw Jen pacing back and forth repeating &quot;oh god oh god oh god.&quot; He tried to stand up, but when he got to his feet he noticed his new height and recoiled backwards, tripping on his now oversized jeans. Causing him to fall onto what felt like a water bed, but when he reached down to prod at it, he realised that it was his own fat ass that he landed on. While looking down he looked between his legs and screamed in horror at the fact that he no longer had his prized member, but instead had a fully formed vagina. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain!&quot; Jen hastily said as she shuffled over to Kevin &quot;Some dweeb named kyle used the towns curse to turn me into a short version of myself, and he made it so i would be completely boy crazy and when my spit touches someones dick it makes them become like me!&quot; she stopped to catch her breath. Kevin was taken aback by what Jen said. &quot;So youre saying, that since we had sex, and some of your spit got on me, it made me transform into a short fat girl!? What the fuck?! That makes no sense!&quot; Kevin squealed in his new squeaky tone. &quot;You know the town curse! I thought it was just a myth too until I was stuck as a busty midget!&quot; Jen replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so we gotta just find this kyle guy and get him to turn us back right? That shouldn&#39;t be too hard.&quot; Kevin mused. &quot;Well it might be harder than you think, if i remember correctly you should now be as boy crazy as me... So the next guy you see who you find hot in any way, will become your one true love until you fuck them... Thats why I was coming on to you before, I didn&#39;t want to, but the curse made me.&quot; Jen shyly admitted. &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid, I&#39;m still straight. There&#39;s no way I&#39;d wanna do a guy.&quot; Kevin said almost boasting. &quot;Yeah but remember, you *are* a girl now, and straight girls... You&#39;ll soon find out I guess...&quot; Jen said.</p>
