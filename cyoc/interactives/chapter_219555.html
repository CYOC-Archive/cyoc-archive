<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Master?” The butler called out, William was still trying to figure out what to do. His only hope was Lila… a hope that she too was unchanged, still had her own daily wish and could fix this mess. But he had to help this family,<br />
<br />
“I WISH THIS FAMILY IS BACK TO NORMAL, AND THEY DON’T REMEMBER THAT ANY OF THIS HAPPENED!!” He shouted, “especially the baby, she won’t remember what just happened. Me, the changes, the fairy or anything, just what she knew before…” William finished, he turned to look at the Butler. Surprisingly she had a look of worry and shock on her face.<br />
<br />
William watched as the bimbo/himbo duo started to return to their original reality, their bodies morphing and changing back to how they were to begin with. They did happen to… be inside of each other, so as Mark’s own appendage started to return, the two were forced out of each other, ending their intercourse. Their facial expressions started to change as their lust wisped away, both looking in horror. They were both uncomfortably aware of what was going on, while subsequently having no idea what had just happened. They both looked at their daughter, sitting right by the front door. They looked at each other, blushing deeply, uncomfortably. They also happened to both be completely naked!<br />
<br />
William entered the car and ordered the butler to drive off immediately, only seeing Ted’s terrified stare at the car as their driveway went out of view. The neighbours all seemed to have rushed out of their houses to get an eye on all the noise. William couldn’t help but feel incredibly horrible, guilty… and angry.<br />
“What the HELL is WRONG with you!!” He shouted at the glass jar,<br />
“She cannot hear you, unfortunately,” the butler reminded, her eyes still on the road,<br />
“I-I know…” William said, his voice shaking a little, “I just… that poor family. They’re…”<br />
“The way you worded your wish, Master William… it solved the problem, but not so efficiently,”<br />
“What the hell was I supposed to do!?” He replied, frustratedly, “I was… u-under pressure,”<br />
“I understand,” the butler said, “what exactly are your intentions going forward?” She asked,<br />
“I-I…” William stuttered, “can’t you just find out yourself?”<br />
“I am not able to access your subconscience,” she stated, “only an approximation of your wants and desires, based on what I understand of you,”<br />
“Could the last ten years have changed that?”<br />
“Yes,” the butler said bluntly, “that is why… I feel worry,” she admitted, “I’m not designed to worry. However I am afraid,”<br />
<br />
William stayed quiet. Something about all of this waking making himself truly afraid. He just hoped Lila was okay, and would even remember him. He had this terrible feeling in his gut that she’d completely forgotten him, lived her life for ten years and wouldn’t want to return… or even send him back. He decided not to dwell on it,<br />
“How long until we reach Lila?” He asked,<br />
“Three hours,”<br />
“Right,” William said. He paused, thinking of something else to ask. Having an omniscient butler is one thing, but thinking of questions is another, “so who gave me the wishes?” He asked,<br />
“I’d rather not get into it,” the butler said hesitantly, “before you ask again, I do know. However I am not allowed to speak on their behalf, but you will meet them eventually. When you finish,”<br />
“Finish what?” William asked,<br />
“With the wishes,” she stated, “you have one wish per day for one month, and if you are successful, you will—” she stopped talking, staring right at the road ahead. It was like she realised what she was saying, and she was oversharing… “I am sorry William. You will find out, on your own,”<br />
“O-okay…” William said, “I’m not even sure I want wishes now, considering everything that has happened because of them,” he stated. The butler remained silent. He felt awkward, “I-I just… I was fourteen, now I’m twenty-four. It’s like I have a conscience now, like everything I would’ve wished for was selfish, now I’m not sure,”<br />
“I see,” the butler replied. She didn’t seem so engaged, still looking as if she did something wrong. Like she’d been caught. It was odd. As far as William knew, she wasn’t supposed to be aware, just a mindless assistant that can do anything. That knows everything. When he was a kid he didn’t much care for her consciousness, but now; he couldn’t help but ask,<br />
“Are you alive?”<br />
“Yes,” the butler replied, “physically, I am a living entity,”<br />
“Let me rephrase,” William said, clearing his throat, “are you… conscious?”<br />
“In what way do you mean?”<br />
“Like… how I’m conscious, or other people are conscious,”<br />
“I am…” she started, but stopped, unable to really figure out an answer. It seemed like an impossible question for her, “…not sure,” she stated. William felt the car swerve just the tiniest amount. She wasn’t going to crash, but clearly she was dazzled, “William,” she started, sounding more sincere than he’d ever heard,<br />
“Y-yeah?” He replied, looking at her. She twitched her eye, briefly making eye contact with him before returning her gaze to the road,<br />
“Please don’t ask me that question,” she said,<br />
“Sorry,” he said, “I didn’t mean to—”<br />
“You have done nothing wrong,” she interrupted him, “it’s just something I don’t even want to know. My purpose is to help you. To assist you. To aid you. To pleasure you… my purpose is you, William,”<br />
William went silent. He became aware.<br />
The butler only existed because he made her exist. She lived a life to be subservient to him. Her life circulated around him.<br />
“And I didn’t even give you a name…” he said, almost wanting to break down in guilt, “this wish… it’s barely a wish, it’s more like a curse,” he said melodramatically,<br />
“You could call me Alicia,” the butler said. William looking a little stunned,<br />
“Alicia?” He replied, “w-why?”<br />
“I thought you’d like it,” she said with a smile on her face. The regular smile,<br />
“I… I like it,” he said, “Alicia,” he also smiled.<br />
<br />
Alicia and William continued talking for the remainder of the journey. Occasionally William would look at the fairy in the jar, she’d stare back at him with disdain in her eyes. She would do anything to ruin his life, or his plans. Whatever they could be…<br />
<br />
— — — <br />
<br />
“We are here,” Alicia said, pulling into the driveway of an odd looking apartment complex. She looked at William, “Floor Three, Room Forty-Five,” she said. William then reached into his pocket and produced a pair of keys, even with a label on them for the room. Weird.<br />
<br />
He exited the car, Alicia nodded as she went to finish parking the car.<br />
William made his way up the stairs, almost making him want to pass out. Once he could make wishes without thinking, he’d wish himself back to a fit level… or even fitter!<br />
He reached the door. It was plain white door, just like the rest. He was ready to unlock it… then realised he was entering someone’s apartment. I mean, what if it was the wrong door. What if Lila was with someone. With her husband! What if she was already married… he couldn’t help his mind from racing. He decided simply to knock on the door.<br />
<br />
“WAIT!” A voice shouted from inside, he couldn’t recognise it. It wasn’t clear if it was Lila, or even female. He simply did as asked. He waited.<br />
<br />
After at least three minutes of shuffling, stomping, and general annoyed grunting noises, William heard the someone come to the door. He felt embarrassed, awkward. For the first time he was suddenly aware his baggy t-shirt was riding up on his belly. He braced…<br />
<br />
The door swung open. In front of him, standing at a height only a few inches below his own (which wasn’t that tall), Lila. Very different from the last time he saw her,<br />
“Who the hell are you supposed to be?” She started, Williams eyes gone wide, “are you someone I managed to sleep with as well or… are you…” she seemed to suddenly figure it out, “WILLIAM!” She said with joy, her eyes welling up. She grabbed him and pulled him inside, closing the door quickly behind her, “holy shit…” she said, scanning him up and down, “you’re… hairy,” she teased,<br />
“T-talk about…” William stated, unable to really form a sentence as he took in… everything.<br />
<br />
“Oh right,” Lila said, “guess who’s gonna be a mom,” she said.<br />
Lila looked the same age as William, somewhere around twenty-four. She’d clearly gone and lost the majority of the weight she’d gained the last time they’d seen each other, yet some of her pudge remained. It wasn’t clear if that was due to her first wish, or from the massive pregnant belly she had on display. It was definitely bigger than an average one, “turns out it’s twins…,” she said, “I checked this morning. Apparently I’ve got a boyfriend,” she admitted. William couldn’t help but blush, “actually no, I think he’s my fiance,” she said, “luckily he’s out of town, on a business trip or something, I can’t really remember,”<br />
“Yeah…” William said, “I can’t remember a lot, just… hazy memories,” he said, “mostly…”<br />
“People you slept with?” She asked,<br />
“Y-yeah…” he said,<br />
“Same with me,” she said. She looked down, “sorry about being so… big,” she said, “don’t really have any clothes that fit,” she said, her belly sticking out of her shirt, her big popped belly button for all to see. William also couldn’t help but see her nipples were erect underneath the shirt, as well as quite big. Along with… quite a display, “eyes up here!” She said, seeing him staring. He snapped back to her eyes, she had a smirk on her face. He had to ask,<br />
“W-wait… I thought we were unaffected by the epidemic?”<br />
“So did I, that’s why I was confused as well,” she said, “turns out I was due for a pretty… big change when I hit fifteen. These babies came in, think they’re E cups or something, same as my mom,” she said, “or at least they were, they’ve gotten bigger,”<br />
“Because of the baby,” William said,<br />
“Babies,” she corrected, “still weird to feel them, not the best but I think it’s pretty hot,” she said, she looked in the mirror at herself. William couldn’t help but have the tiniest erection…<br />
“Speaking of ‘that’ epidemic,” Lila started, “I’ve seen a lot of huuuuuge cocks. Yours hasn’t changed, has it,” she said, William blushed,<br />
“N-no,” he said,<br />
“This is weird… but listen, I’ve got a fiance, I’m sure you’ve got a girlfriend,” she started, William felt awkward, “can I just have a peek?”<br />
“LILA!” He shouted, “this is seriously how you’re gonna act!” He couldn’t help but say, she seemed a little taken aback, “we’ve aged ten years! I’m a fat hairy man and… and you’re pregnant!” He said, “you can’t seriously be… wanting to see my cock,”<br />
“Dude,” she said, “I’m just horny, okay,” she admitted, “I mean you said it, I’m pregnant. I’m huge! My sex drive is crazy right now!”<br />
“Look,” William said, calming himself down, “I need you to make a wish, so we can go back to before I made the stupid ‘Big Tits’ ‘Big Dick’ wish, and we can just live our lives,”<br />
“Why can’t you just make the wish?” Lila asked, “I mean I assumed we couldn’t make wishes anymore. You said it was for like the month, right?”<br />
“I-I did… I think,”<br />
“Yeah, so I assumed that month was over, y’know, because it’s been ten years,”<br />
“I guess that makes sense,” William admitted, “but no, we still have wishes. But we can’t waste them,” he said,<br />
“Damn, so did you use yours already?” She asked, she cracked a smirk, “what did you wish for?”<br />
“I had… to fix something. A problem,”<br />
“Did you make your dick average sized?”<br />
“NO!” He yelled, “there was an incident. You remember the fairy,”<br />
“Yeah,”<br />
“I had to get her. She was still in the jar, and she broke out, and this couple got turned into sex monsters, and I had to use my wish to help them.<br />
“Sex monsters…” Lila said, looking a little turned on herself. William got even more frustrated, “why didn’t you just leave them, they probably wouldn’t have noticed,”<br />
“They had a kid. The fairy was going to transform her. She was a baby, hardly three,” William said,<br />
“Okay,” Lila said, “that… that was the right thing to do, you wouldn’t want to hurt a baby,” she said, “she needs parents… not sex monsters,” Lila hesitated,<br />
“What?” William asked,<br />
“I just… okay I’ll be honest,” Lila said, “I kinda assumed I had a wish,” she admitted, “I wanted to use it to get rid of these babies inside of me,” she said, “but I was scared… any wish I could use, it’d hurt them. Or it could hurt them, and I just can’t do that…”<br />
“Don’t tell me you’re attached…” William sighed,<br />
“They’re my kids!” Lila shouted, “I know I didn’t ‘technically’ make them, and I guess I haven’t even met them yet… but I’m not gonna just wish them away. I still… I want to have them,” she said, “I want to raise them!” She shouted, proudly, “I… I know I missed however many years and stuff, but I always wanted to be a mom!”<br />
<br />
William was silent. She wasn’t lying. And she wasn’t wrong. Whatever she did with those babies was up to her, but the decision she made affected whether or not he could get back home. Back to 2013. Back to being a kid again.<br />
William didn’t even know if he wanted to be a kid again. Had he been chasing something he wasn’t even sure he wanted?<br />
<br />
“William,” Lila started, “I can use my wish to send you back home,” she said, “and I’m really willing to do that, even if it’s my last wish,”<br />
“No,” William said, “we’ll figure out how to do this… right now we just… I think I need a drink.”<br />
Lila smiled, “I have wine.”</p>
