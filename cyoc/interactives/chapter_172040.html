<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   You guide her to the living room and sit her down on the couch, throwing a blanket on her and telling her not to move, to which she responds with a muffled, &quot;Mm-kay.&quot; You move into her kitchen and get some popcorn popping, figuring that food solves most problems anyway. While it cooks you lean behind her and say, &quot;I figured we could just watch a movie and cuddle, how&#39;s that sound.&quot;<br />
   It looks like some of her old boldness has come back, because she leans back, lolling her head to face yours and gives an enthusiastic and silly, &quot;Yeh!&quot;<br />
   That&#39;s good enough for you, so you set out the popcorn and put in one of her old guilty pleasures, a slightly-trashy romcom about a cop who has to work with a prostitute in a red light district to catch a killer hiding out there. As you start it going, your girlfriend starts wrestling with her blanket to try and get her pants off.<br />
   &quot;Uh, what are you doing?&quot; you ask.<br />
   &quot;I thought these pants would be more comfy but they just rub against my dick and make me horny. I hate it!&quot; She finishes tussling when she&#39;s brought her skinny jeans down to the point they&#39;re stretched between her legs, at which point she kicks them a few times until they hit the floor. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s my house. If I&#39;m just gonna stay in all day with my boyfriend, no way am I wearing pants.&quot;<br />
   Seems reasonable to you, and your pussy, having heated up a bit, seems to agree. You start to do the same.<br />
   &quot;Um, what are you doing?&quot; she asks in turn.<br />
   &quot;Showing solidarity, I guess.&quot; As your jeans hit the ground next to hers, you feel your seat dampen slightly as your briefs hug your flat crotch, and her normal panties show a sizeable bulge. You wrap yourself up and cuddle next to her, hearing her coo slightly as she leans into you and the two of you, bundled up, try to put the day&#39;s events behind you.<br />
   The movie is one the two of you have seen several times, and the two of you enjoy it in mutual silence for a while, until a point about 45 minutes in, when the prostitute makes a casual joke about some of their brothel co-workers being &quot;not entirely female.&quot; At that point you feel her pull away from you, and you&#39;re not sure why. That is, until you notice her glancing downwards and see that the head of her dick is poking out of her panty leg. You look at her, and she looks at you, and she turns red as a beet, trying to shimmy into a more comfy position.<br />
   &quot;Babe?&quot; she says, looking at you. &quot;Could I ask you an enormous favor?&quot;<br />
   You already know what it is, and you throw your blanket aside and kneel before her. What catches you off-guard is how normal it all looks, her shaved, immaculate, feminine legs reminding you of the handful of times the two of you have fucked. Then up to a pair of pink panties you recognize from all the teasing she&#39;s done over the years and then...<br />
   There&#39;s her dick. And it&#39;s a monster, at least 8 inches long, bigger than you ever were. You feel like you&#39;re being emasculated all over again as you compare her dick to your arm. It goes at least halfway to your elbow. You can even see the outline of her balls through that cute translucent lace, at least an inch across. You feel your undercarriage growing hot as your knees burn against the shag carpet. And without really knowing why, you yank those cute pink panties down to her knees and gasp as her little soldier stands at attention, batting you right in the lips and filling your nose with the salty smell of precum.<br />
   &quot;DUDE!&quot; you say, sputtering a bit as you try to get rid of the taste.<br />
   &quot;Shit! Sorry!&quot; she says, squirming a bit.<br />
   You move your hand to keep her leg in place, and she stops squirming. She&#39;s still red in the face as she says, &quot;Babe, what are you...?&quot;<br />
   &quot;You&#39;re ENORMOUS!&quot; you say. &quot;What the hell was your school thinking, weighing you girls down with a tackle box this big?&quot;<br />
   &quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; she laughs, her legs kicking a bit with her panties still stretched taut between her ankles. &quot;It&#39;s probably the same bullshit reason they did it in the first place, you know, sports team metrics and other bullshit. Bigger dick means more field goals, I don&#39;t fucking know.&quot;<br />
   There&#39;s no going back now for you, so you reach in there and start fondling her hairless balls, trying to feel out the different organs they taught you in sex-ed. What a perverted way to use the knowledge -- and tools, that your schools gave you! She squirms and protests a little more, until your other hand grabs her right at the base of her dick, at which she goes completely stock-still.<br />
   Your lust has officially gotten the better of you, and you give her the most seductive look you can muster. &quot;You know if they really want to pump up the sports numbers they should start a girls&#39; football team. You think if your team won against mine they&#39;d let you fuck the other team in the girls&#39; locker room -- or the boys?&quot; You steel yourself and give an exploratory lick against her head, and swallow a bead of precum. At this point she&#39;s groaning in pure lust at the alien sensations flooding her. A switch flicks in your head as you realize that you could do anything you wanted with her.<br />
   &quot;You know,&quot; you say, &quot;My friend Lance got quarterback again this year. That was right before the procedure. He had it done a bit before mine was. And you know what? He looks like a total fucking twink now. How about me, baby? Do I look good? You want me to fuck you?&quot;<br />
   She&#39;s pressed into the sofa now, trying not to hyperventilate as you&#39;re perched right in front of her fresh new monster dick. &quot;If-- if you...&quot; she pants.<br />
   &quot;What&#39;s up babe?&quot; you ask, suddenly fearing you&#39;ve gone too far. You lean in next to her face to hear what she has to say.<br />
   &quot;If you... if you hold your breath... it&#39;s easier... babe... please...&quot;<br />
   You pick up on what she&#39;s putting down with a devious smile. You resume the position, wetting her dick with her copious precum that&#39;s now staining the carpet before taking a deep breath and shoving that dick in your mouth. You force your mouth to stay open, swallowing your girlfriend&#39;s dick and the last bit of male pride that you were still holding onto in the quest for pure lust. The awful taste is back, but it&#39;s easier to stomach when you&#39;re holding your breath, and you pump what&#39;s left outside your mouth with one hand while fondling her beautiful balls with the other. The last task you devote yourself to is wrapping your lips around that big tool, sucking down on it like a huge salty popsicle while licking it for all you&#39;re worth. It&#39;s only as an afterthought that you consider what your endgame is with all this, and it looks like it&#39;s coming fast...<br />
   She moans loudly as she nears relief, practically screaming for you to finish her off. You feel your hand pulled as her balls contract ever-so-slightly, and steel yourself as she thrusts that rod down your throat fully. Your gullet contracts around her tip and you feel you have no choice but to swallow as the first salvo fires. She proves to be too much for you and you pull away, trying to swallow the rest but choking on her load as it floods your nostrils. You pull away and she moans in something approaching pain as she&#39;s too bundled-up to stroke herself through the rest of orgasm.<br />
   She looks down at you in complete satisfaction and says, &quot;I never thought you would look so hot with cum coming out your nose, dude.&quot;<br />
   You feel it too, burning hot in your sinuses. You give her an exhausted smile and grab a napkin, trying to force it out of your nostrils. It takes you a good few minutes and by the time you&#39;re done, you&#39;re saddened to see her dick has entirely deflated, to a flaccid 3 inches. You give it a pat, and she jumps. &quot;Hey! That hurts now! Cut that out!&quot; You laugh as you start to bundle yourself up, entirely spent, and lean into her embrace, which she readily accepts.<br />
   &quot;Fuck, I think some of my cum got in the popcorn, babe. Should we make some more?&quot;<br />
   You think for a second and shrug. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not like that&#39;ll taste any worse than straight cum does. Hand it over.&quot;<br />
   She does, and you feel yourself getting a little bit back into the mood as you eat pieces of extra-salty popcorn. As you near the bottom of the bowl, the perversion of what you&#39;re doing takes hold again and you lean in and give your girlfriend a sloppy, cummy kiss. She opens her eyes in shock but, to your surprise, presses into you and sticks her tongue in. You reflect that she&#39;s probably still more used to the taste of cum than you are, and feel a heat in your loins once again as life slowly returns to your girlfriend&#39;s dick.</p>
