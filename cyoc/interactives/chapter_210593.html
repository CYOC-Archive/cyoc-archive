<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff scrolled through all the exotic options for animal transformations, but for most of them he wasn&#39;t really sure how he would make it as one out in the wild. After all, he couldn&#39;t just stay in his house as one for any practical amount of time, but he didn&#39;t want to meet some gruesome end out in the wilderness as, say, a deer. Of course, he could easily try a package for an animal like a dog or a cat, and out of the two a cat was the appealing option to him. The thoughts of lying in the sun lazily and moving with feline grace were very tantalizing. He only felt it a shame this would have to be a mostly instant change, since he was a huge fan of slower transformations. But as he thought this, he still idly scrolled down past the various animal packages, which led to an option he wasn&#39; expecting: Reality Shift.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at it for a moment before clicking on it. An explanation flashed on screen. Reality Shift served as a way to alter the perception of those around a transforming individual while they were in the transformation process. Essentially, he would be seen as the end result of his transformation, no matter what state his body was in, even if his features didn&#39;t match up. They would consider it normal as he slowly shifted into his new state. This was greatly tempting for Jeff, and he eagerly scrolled down to the cat option under this new window, clicking on it.<br />
<br />
More options popped up. He carefully read them, noting the facets of each one. An incredible amount of detail could be entered into it through all of these options, letting Jeff personalize his experience effortlessly. He wasn&#39;t completely sure where to begin, so he took his gaze back to the top. He could focus on the simple stuff for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breed of Cat&quot; it read. He wasn&#39;t really picky about that, so he simply chose the most default looking option, which looked sleek (and therefore appealing as an option) to him. He specified, however, that he wanted his fur to be a faintly bluish silver color, as he had seen a cat with it once and he found it very wonderful to look at. &quot;Gender&quot; was the next option, and Jeff once again wasn&#39;t particularly picky. Either would suffice for being a cat, but in the end he decided he would try being a female cat, just to increase the new sensations he could have. For &quot;Age&quot;, he input 2 Years, old enough to be an adult cat but still pretty young by cat standards.<br />
<br />
As he went down, more details about his reality shift can into focus. The transformation would take a week in total, so he could appreciate the transition for a good amount of time without it being too long. There was also the question of instincts and thoughts he would have, as he might have trouble actually moving as a cat without them, so the default settings had him mentally transition to a cat as he shrank, not really disappearing, but effectively being shelved for the duration. However, he didn&#39;t particularly want to lose his human intellect. So he went into an advanced settings tab for the option, where the catlike instincts could be added seperately from the mind change. He would have the catlike instincts come to him as he changed, but he would maintain his personality and memories.<br />
<br />
Some more esoteric options came up. One such option was diet, and how he could maintain his ability to eat and process human food without a risk of illness as a cat, or he could adjust his palate and mentality to enjoy food meant for cats, which was the default. He wasn&#39;t particularly against eating cat food as long as he could stomach it mentally, but he also felt like being able to eat human food would help a lot as well, so he added it on top of the default settings. <br />
<br />
Another option was for the environment he would be put into. He wasn&#39;t interested in being a stray, so he made sure to select a household environment, which brought up additional options. Namely, the state of the house he would be living in, the people and other pets it would hold, and his treatment in the house. He looked at this for a second before smiling, making it be a modestly rich household. He wanted to be pampered as a cat, and to be afforded great luxury would make this very easy. He decided the family should be a husband and wife, their young daughter, and a male cat of 2 and a half years. He specified little about the people, but for the cat, he added that he would be trained to do his business outdoors (as Jeff didn&#39;t want to have to deal with a litter box), and that he wasn&#39;t neutered and wouldn&#39;t be. While he wasn&#39;t necessarily looking for anything, he certainly wouldn&#39;t be opposed to it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, for his own treatment, he insured he wouldn&#39;t be spayed at any point, and that he was given free reign of the household, including the beds. He also added that he was considered to be trained to go outside in the same way the male cat was. And his name as a cat would be Mist, simply because he liked the way it sounded. He also made sure he could access the Chronivac through a mental link, in case anything wasn&#39;t to his liking.<br />
<br />
He adjusted some smaller things to his own tastes, and after a good amount of time, he was done with his selections. He looked it over once more to be absolutely sure everything was in order. He then hit submit, suddenly finding himself in a living room.</p>
