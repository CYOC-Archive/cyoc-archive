<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lunch was served to the cast and crew buffet style under a tent, as the sun shined brightly overhead. The commotion of residents, which had died down as the work day began, picked up again in the afternoon. Residents crowded around the street near the park, hoping to catch a glimpse of someone famous. <br />
<br />
“I wonder if we’ll see anybody we recognize” a passerby commented to her friend. <br />
<br />
Despite their optimistic hopes, no one famous would be on the set of the commercial shoot that day. Instead, getting some things to eat was Evan, Michael Scavolini’s son. He poured more food than one could possibly eat onto a tray filled with five plates; two appetizer plates, two entrees plates and one giant plate of desert. <br />
<br />
“You’re never going to eat all of that” Michael commented. <br />
<br />
“I will so” Evan replied defiantly. <br />
<br />
At the other end of the set, in his own personal trailer, was the other star of the commercial, Buddy the dog. He was, in actuality, Freddy Benson, Evan’s father. He looked up at Tom, who was serving him some food that Gary, one of the PA’s, had kindly brought for them. <br />
<br />
“Hungry, boy?” Tom said, as he held up a hot dog in his hand. <br />
<br />
“You bet” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy woofed loudly. <br />
<br />
Buddy’s tongue drooled onto the floor below, eager to be fed what Tom was offering him. He had cuddled with Lady for a bit, who was feeling unwell that day. She didn’t feel like getting up from the dog bed, even though it was put there for Buddy’s use. She felt sore and bled all over the blanket. Little did they know that she was also worried about who might pay her a visit, attracted by the scent of her heat. <br />
<br />
“Here you go” Tom said, as he placed the piece of meat on Buddy’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Buddy devoured it quickly and licked his snout happily. <br />
<br />
“Much better than that god awful dog food earlier” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
At the lunch area, Evan and Michael had finished getting what they wanted to eat. On their way back to the trailer, they saw Michael’s mother wandering around the set. <br />
<br />
“Mom!” Michael called out to her. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“I’m just taking it all in” she replied. “How many times in my life will I be able to say I was on the set of an actual commercial?”<br />
<br />
“Come on, grandma” Evan said. “I want to get back to my trailer to dig in.”<br />
<br />
“Just give me a minute, Evan. Let me take this in while I still can.”<br />
<br />
As Michael’s mother continued to walk around the set, Michael noticed a car pull up on the sidewalk. One of the PA’s, who was keeping traffic away from the set, had easily let this particular vehicle go through to park. <br />
<br />
“I wonder who that could be?” Michael thought to himself.<br />
<br />
When the car had parked, the doors opened to the mayor and three of his advisors, Adam, Dennis and Marley, stepping out onto the set.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit. That’s not good.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Mayor” a police officer said who approached him. “We weren’t expecting you to pay a visit today.”<br />
<br />
“How could I not?” the mayor replied, as the residents gawked at their hometown leader. “I made this day possible, after all. How could I not come down here and pay you all a visit?”<br />
<br />
A mad rush of people ran towards him, as Michael saw Evan approach him. <br />
<br />
“What’s the mayor doing here?” Evan asked, as his tray wobbled in his hands. <br />
<br />
“He’s probably going to do something bad, Evan” Michael replied. “If I know him, then his presence here is not going to be good news for us.”<br />
<br />
Michael motioned to his mother. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go back in the trailer to eat” he said to her. <br />
<br />
“Ok, I’m coming” his mother replied. <br />
<br />
The three of them walked back to Evan’s trailer, as the mayor glad-handed and greeted the various crew members on set. Once inside the trailer, Evan sat down on the couch and began to dig into the copious amounts of food on his plates. Michael nervously pulled out his communication device and sent a message to Chris. <br />
<br />
Earlier in the day, Sofya had come back to Michael’s house. She was feeling gross and disgusting; having gone into public without showering first. When she stepped inside the house, she noticed Chris sitting on the couch. He was drinking coffee, seemingly lost in thought. <br />
<br />
“You should take a shower” Sofya noted. “You smell like the cum that’s still stuck to your beard.”<br />
<br />
“I will” Chris replied. “After you.”<br />
<br />
Sofya snorted, as she made her way into the guest bathroom. She lathered her body up with soap, which was not as svelte or wrinkle free at it had been for centuries. The undoing of the age freezing spell had aged her significantly. It happened rapidly the first ten years after the spell was broken. It lead some people to wonder if something was wrong with her health. However, by the time her body hit 30 in human years, the aging began to slow down significantly. <br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shower, she dried herself off and got dressed. When she stepped outside the bathroom, she could see Chris waiting out in the hall. He held a towel in one hand and a change of clothes in the other. Sofya nodded, as she stepped aside, to let Chris go inside to rinse himself off. <br />
<br />
Chris carefully shampooed Michael’s sticky load out of his beard and hairy chest. It had been fun to hook up with him earlier, but now he was worried about the long term repercussions of what they had done. <br />
<br />
“I hope Sofya is wrong about Michael telling Freddy about this” Chris thought to himself, as he showered himself off. “I don’t want to deal with Freddy being mad at me that I fucked his husband again when he wasn’t here.”<br />
<br />
When he was done cleaning off his body, Chris stepped out of the shower and dried himself off. It took some time, being as hairy as he was, but he managed to do it. Stepping up to the sink, he took out a beard trimmer and made some adjustments to the bushy mane on his face. <br />
<br />
“This is getting a little too long” Chris thought to himself, as he sheared around the edges to give his beard a more symmetrical look. “It’s looking too long and ratty for my taste. Keeping it a little trimmer might be a better look. I’ll probably be trimming my body hair with this thing soon, too, once this is over.”<br />
<br />
Not wanting to do a full on body hair grooming today, Chris made his beard look even and shorter. It was still big, but it didn’t look as pointy as it had before. Proud of what he had done with his face, Chris rubbed his beard with a smile, before he put on some casual clothes and made his way out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
When Chris went downstairs, he found Sofya sitting with her communication device at the table in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“So we should be getting to set soon” Chris commented. <br />
<br />
“Not yet” Sofya replied. <br />
<br />
“Uh, why’s that?”<br />
<br />
“That set is surrounded by cops. It’s impossible to get in a close enough vicinity to keep our car parked for the long term. It’s best to wait until Michael tells us that the mayor is there and then we head over there to meet him.”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it too late to go over there by the time the mayor arrives to set? By the time we’ve arrived, he’ll have probably already read the inscription and Freddy will have changed back again.”<br />
<br />
“We’re only, what, five, maybe ten minutes away from that park at most? Once Michael gives us the word, we’ll be over there as soon as possible. The mayor is a politician. He’s going to want to hobnob with the crew, have everyone lick his asshole and tell him how wonderful he is first, before he goes and reads the inscription on the ring. Plus, he’s going to want to do it as they are filming. <br />
<br />
“The crew will stop for a few minutes. The director, who was definitely checking me out earlier, will chat with him and then they will resume filming. Once the mayor has the eyes off of him, that’s when he’ll read the inscription. We’ll have some time to head over there before this occurs. We just have to hope Michael signals to us in time.”<br />
<br />
“I still think it’d be best to scope out the set right now, just in case, but you’re the psychic and magic expert, so I’ll leave it to your judgement.”<br />
<br />
Sofya gave Chris a scowling look. <br />
<br />
“Is that supposed to be sarcasm?”<br />
<br />
Chris held his hands up defensively. <br />
<br />
“Nope. Not at all. I was just giving you my advice, seeing as I served in the army for four years and was a police officer for ten. I know security situations pretty well, but you have that psychic instinct. I’ll defer to your judgement on what we should do here.”<br />
<br />
Sofya continued to give him a scowl. Chris cocked his eyebrows in response.<br />
<br />
“Why are you looking at me like that, Sofya?”<br />
<br />
“I still can’t believe you fucked Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god. Sofya—“<br />
<br />
“How could you do something so stupid in the middle of an important mission like this? Once Freddy finds out—“<br />
<br />
“He’s not going to find out, Sofya, if we don’t tell him.”<br />
<br />
“But that’s what you don’t seem to understand. Michael is going to tell him. That’s how he is. Even without my ability to read into his thoughts, he’s an open book. Freddy will get it out of him as soon as they meet up again, even if Michael doesn’t want to tell him, which I suspect he does.”<br />
<br />
“How do you know all of this?”<br />
<br />
Sofya pointed to her head. <br />
<br />
“That ‘psychic instinct’ you mentioned.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I wish he’d just keep his mouth shut.”<br />
<br />
“I wish you would have just kept your dick in your pants.”<br />
<br />
“In fairness to me, Michael took my dick out of my pants and inserted it into his asshole.”<br />
<br />
“That was the first time. What about the time after that?”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, as Sofya stared at him, with a stern expression on her face. <br />
<br />
“Ok” Sofya continued “so maybe his horny little ass was angry at Freddy and was using you to get back at him a bit. You could have said no. When you woke up and saw what you were doing, you could have pushed him off of you and ran away into the bathroom. You didn’t do that. You let him give you head and then you fucked him afterwards. He’s an little, angry imp, but you enabled him to cheat on his husband.”<br />
<br />
“Sofya, I made a mistake, but I don’t want Freddy to be mad at me over this.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you had respected their vows of faithfulness, then you wouldn’t have this problem, now would you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know why you’re getting so high and mighty about this, Sofya. Michael said to me last night that he thought your husband was cheating on you.”<br />
<br />
Sofya stared at Chris silently, fuming in anger, as she glared at him.<br />
<br />
“Not the only one with secrets around here, are we Sofya?”<br />
<br />
“Michael doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about.”<br />
<br />
“He said that your husband is hardly ever home, that he has his own place by his office and that he showed up unannounced when they went to your house two days ago. He’s cheating on you and yet expects that you can’t do the same?”<br />
<br />
“I would never cheat on my husband, asshole! He would never cheat on me, either! You’re in no position to judge anyone, let alone me, You’re a thirty something man with no prospects of any woman ever loving you and wanting to be your wife!”<br />
<br />
Chris stared silently, as he began to fume internally. <br />
<br />
“You know what, Sofya, Michael was right about you after all. Freddy really gives you the benefit of the doubt, but the truth is, Michael got your number a long time ago. You’re mean, nasty and spiteful. No wonder you have to use magic to have a relationship with your son.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s eyes turned red. She jolted up from her chair, as she angrily glared at him.<br />
<br />
“How dare you! How dare—“<br />
<br />
“Michael said you used magic to get your son to leave and stop asking so many questions. How can anyone say you’re a good parent if you basically have to manipulate your son to have a relationship with you?”<br />
<br />
“How dare—“<br />
<br />
“Michael is a good dad because he doesn’t have to manipulate Evan to love him.”<br />
<br />
“Evan is a snot nosed little brat and his biological father, who he’s not even aware of yet, was scum of the Earth. Such offspring cannot be saved.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not true. Daniel may have been an ass, but Evan is nothing like him. He’s a great kid. He just needs a little bit of love and attention to help him pull through the stuff he’s dealing with right now. I have faith in him. Certainly more faith in him than you do in your own kid following your instructions, without you having to use your magic to compel him to do it.”<br />
<br />
Sofya pointed her finger at him ominously. <br />
<br />
“Don’t make me change you back into a gorilla again. That can be arranged.”<br />
<br />
“What would that do for you, exactly? See me attack you and overpower you with my gorilla strength? Take out a critical ally in helping Freddy become human again and getting back the ring? What do you gain out of fighting me?”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s eyes returned to normal, as she sat back down in her chair.<br />
<br />
“Be rational about this, Sofya. Getting into spats like this isn’t helpful for us right now. We need to stay calm and remain united as a team.”<br />
<br />
“Apologize.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Apologize for saying my husband is cheating on me first!”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
Sofya quickly stood up again, as her eyes turned red once more.<br />
<br />
“Apologize asshole!”<br />
<br />
“Tell me where he is right now.”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“Tell me where your husband is right now and then I will apologize to you.”<br />
<br />
“He’s at work.”<br />
<br />
“Prove it.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s eyes returned to normal, as she stared at Chris nervously. His confident demeanor freaked her out in that moment. <br />
<br />
“Prove to me your husband is where you say he is” he insisted “and then I will apologize to you.”<br />
<br />
“I have nothing to prove to you” Sofya replied gruffly.<br />
<br />
“Then I have nothing to apologize for. Either you show me that he’s where you say he is right now or I’m not apologizing.”<br />
<br />
Sofya grunted, as she took her communication device. She found Roberto’s number and tried to call her husband. After several rings passed, the call would not go through.<br />
<br />
“He’s busy” Sofya said as an excuse. <br />
<br />
“Call his office” Chris suggested with a smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
Sofya grunted again, as she called up the office where Roberto worked. <br />
<br />
“Secretary speaking” a woman said on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
“Hi, this is Sofya, Roberto’s husband. Is he in his office by any chance?”<br />
<br />
“He’s not in today. May I take a message?”<br />
<br />
Sofya gasped, as Chris looked at her with a smirk. He triumphantly folded his arms as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Just tell him I called and to call me back as soon as he gets this message.”<br />
<br />
“Certainly, Sofya. Have a nice day, dear.”<br />
<br />
Sofya ended the call and looked up at Chris nervously. <br />
<br />
“Where is he?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“He’s out” Sofya replied. <br />
<br />
“Out where? He’s not at work, like you said he was, so I’m not apologizing for what I said.”<br />
<br />
Sofya sat silently for a moment, before she had an idea. She conjured up a spell and let out a gasp.<br />
<br />
“That fucker!!!!” she yelled, as she began to cry hysterically. <br />
<br />
Chris unfolded his arms and walked over to approach her. <br />
<br />
“That fucker is with another woman right now!!!!! How could I have not seen this before?!?!?!”<br />
<br />
Chris sat down in a chair next to her and looked at her sympathetically. <br />
<br />
“How?!?!”<br />
<br />
“Love is blind, Sofya. It can blind us from seeing things we don’t want to see. I’m sorry, Sofya. I didn’t want to upset you right now. Come here.”<br />
<br />
Chris gave Sofya a hug, which she passively accepted. He leaned into her, as she allowed herself to cry into his shirt. A few minutes passed them by, as she let go of her emotions into his chest. When she was done sobbing, she pulled back and looked him in the eyes. <br />
<br />
“I like how you trimmed your beard” she said, as she gently stroked it with her fingers. <br />
<br />
“Thanks” Chris replied with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“It’s so…sexy.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s eyes glowed pink, as she looked deeper into Chris’ eyes. She was infuriated in that moment. Her husband, who she assumed was loyal to her all these years, was found to be unfaithful. He was banging a co-worker all along and had been for years. How she was blind to it all this time both angered and depressed her.<br />
<br />
“Maybe that’s why his sperm count was so low” Sofya thought to herself, as he continued to play with Chris’ beard. “Maybe that’s part of why we struggled to have Nikolas.”<br />
<br />
Sofya gazed into Chris’ eyes, who looked back at her with lust in his own. He licked his lips, feeling very turned on in that moment. His dick began to throb and grow under his pants. He had already fucked Michael and given him his load twice that morning. In spite of this, if Sofya was ready, willing and able, he’d gladly plow into her too. Sofya could tell this is what he wanted, without her even having to prompt it. In her anger, she allowed it to happen.<br />
<br />
Sofya kissed Chris on the lips, stroking his beard as she did so. He kissed her back and had her jump up into his arms. He carried her from the kitchen and upstairs into Michael’s bedroom. Chris plopped her down on the bed and aggressively stripped off her clothes. Her body wasn’t as youthful as it was all those years ago, but he didn’t care. It was still sexy, in his opinion. <br />
<br />
Chris bent down and bit on Sofya’s nipple. She moaned in lust, as she stripped off his shirt. His body hair was a bit too much, in her opinion, but she didn’t care in that moment. She felt a need to be bred and wanted Chris to plant her body with his seed. Chris continued to nuzzle his bearded face into her ample bosom, as she unbuttoned his pants and stripped them off of him. <br />
<br />
Chris took his briefs off and threw them on the bed next to his pants. As Sofya opened herself up, Chris spat on his dick and stroked it to full hardness. When he was ready, he lined the head of his dick at the vaginal lips of Sofya’s waiting pussy. Plunging in a quick motion, Chris moaned loudly, as he laid on top of Sofya.<br />
<br />
“Ready for this?” Chris seductively whispered in her ear. <br />
<br />
Sofya nodded, as he began to pump into her vagina. He moaned and she moaned, as they made love to each other. As fun as it was to play around with Michael earlier, Chris knew that his preference was for the soft feel of a woman. He felt her warm vagina grip onto his dick, tightly squeezing his throbbing erection. Chris kissed Sofya on the cheek and rubbed his beard into her neck. Sofya allowed herself to enjoy the sensation of Chris’ fur, as it softly tickled her bosom. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, both of them felt themselves approaching an orgasm. Their sweaty bodies slapped together, moaning into each other in a state of passion and lust. Sofya felt herself reach an orgasmic high, as juice flowed out of her pussy and onto Chris&#39;s pummeling penis. Chris grunted into her ear and shot his load into her vagina. He wasn’t wearing a condom, which troubled him for a moment. He had a fleeting feeling of nervousness after letting his swimmers go off on their journey towards her egg. Soon, he collapsed on top of her and covered her body completely. He kissed her on the lips, as she rubbed her fingers along his hairy back. Panting very loudly, they caught their breaths for a moment, before Chris spoke up.<br />
<br />
“We didn’t use protection just now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, who cares? I mean, unless you have some sort of STD or something. You’re clean, right?”<br />
<br />
“I am.”<br />
<br />
“Then what’s the problem?”<br />
<br />
Chris pulled out of Sofya’s pussy, letting out a loud moan as he did so. He rolled onto the side of the bed and rubbed himself right next to her. <br />
<br />
“I could have gotten you pregnant.”<br />
<br />
Sofya paused for a moment, before she spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Unlikely. It was a real struggle to even conceive Nikolas. I think my father aborting all of the previous fetuses inside of me caused long term damage to my uterus and my fertility. However…”<br />
<br />
Sofya rolled on top of Chris and looked him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“If I do get pregnant from what we did just now” she continued “then I intend to keep the baby.”<br />
<br />
“What if Roberto finds out?” Chris asked nervously.<br />
<br />
“Eh, who cares? He’s a dirty fucking cheater anyway. I intend to file for divorce when this is all over.”<br />
<br />
Chris thought for a moment about something that both excited him and made him nervous at the same time.<br />
<br />
“If you get pregnant, then that means I’m going to be a dad.”<br />
<br />
“That you will.”<br />
<br />
“You know, I’ve always wanted to be a dad. That’s part of why I’ve become so attached to Evan while I’ve been working as Freddy’s bodyguard. I’d really like to have a kid of my own someday. If you were to have this kid, then it’d be my own flesh and blood.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t want him, though.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Chris gently pushed Sofya off of him, as he rolled to look at her in the eyes from his side. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean? How could you abandon a kid like that?”<br />
<br />
“I have a kid already. Nikolas is my kid. He doesn’t need a sibling. You want a kid, so I figured that you’d take them and raise them on your own.”<br />
<br />
“The kid needs a mother, Sofya. I can’t just raise them all by myself.”<br />
<br />
“Sure you could. People do it all the time.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not ideal. People don’t do it unless they have to. Why couldn’t you just raise the kid with me?<br />
<br />
“Because I don’t love you, Chris.”<br />
<br />
Chris laid silently still, as Sofya paused for a moment. She sighed, before she continued with her honest thoughts. <br />
<br />
“I don’t love you, Chris. I get now why Michael did what he did with you earlier. When our husbands get dirty, sometimes we want to get dirty right back. This was just a little bit of fun, fun that I’m wondering if I’m going to regret later, in hindsight.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t regret what we did.”<br />
<br />
“Of course you don’t, Chris, because you’re single and you see this as just a bit of fun for yourself.”<br />
<br />
“I mean—“<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, before he continued. <br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right. I was kind of horny and let my dick get the best of me, again. It was fun, but, admittedly, I don’t love you either. Even though the sex with you was better than it was with Michael earlier, I feel a connection with him outside of the bedroom that goes beyond just pure lust. I could grow to love him as a partner, if he needed me to be there for him. I don’t think I could grow to love you, even though I like pussy better.”<br />
<br />
Chris and Sofya laid silently in the bed, as they thought about what they had just done with each other. They dozed off for a while, before Chris heard his communication device ring. <br />
<br />
“Who is that?” Chris asked groggily, as he reached over to see Michael’s name show up on the screen. “Shit! It’s Michael!”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Sofya asked, as she got up from her nap.<br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Chris!” Michael replied from just outside Evan&#39;s trailer. <br />
<br />
Michael had decided to leave his mother and his son alone for a few minutes to make the private call. As they all ate, Michael noticed that Chris wasn&#39;t answering his messages. He needed to hear from him immediately, so he decided to excuse himself to make the call. Michael found a secluded spot on set, away from the crew, in order to reach out to Chris for help.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, Michael?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you answer your messages?!”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
Chris noticed Michael’s texts, as he looked at the screen on his device. <br />
<br />
“Oops.”<br />
<br />
“Argh! Just get down here now! The mayor is already here! Get down here this instant before he changes Freddy back!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, ok. Just give us like twenty minutes or so and we’ll be over there.”<br />
<br />
“Twenty minutes?!?! I don’t have time to wait that long! Get down here right now!”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Sofya said. “I need to take another shower before I go down there.”<br />
<br />
“Another shower?!?! Sofya, you’ve had four hours to shower and get ready to come back to set!!! What could you have possibly done—“<br />
<br />
“We, uh…” Chris tried to say. <br />
<br />
“No!” Michael said. “You didn’t!”<br />
<br />
“We did” Sofya answered honestly, as she got up from the bed to go shower off. <br />
<br />
“We’ll be down there soon” Chris said with an embarrassed tone in his voice. <br />
<br />
“Oh my god” Michael groaned. “I can’t believe you did it with her too. You’re such an animal, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Michael, but if you remember, we’re not dating and we’re not lovers. I can fuck whoever I want without needing your permission to do so.”<br />
<br />
“Sofya is married, though.”<br />
<br />
“So are you and yet we fucked.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy said it was ok.”<br />
<br />
“He never said it was ok to do it again. Look, can we talk about this later? I need to get ready to go now.”<br />
<br />
“Fine, just get down here as soon as you can.”<br />
<br />
“Can I use your shower?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, fine. Just don’t shed everywhere like a dog, please. I don’t want to have to clean up all your hair from the drain.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll do my best. See you soon.”<br />
<br />
Chris ended the call, as he got up from the bed, showered and got himself ready to head to set. Back on the set, Michael noticed the mayor approaching the trailers. <br />
<br />
“Ah!” the mayor called to him, as he slithered over in his direction. “Michael Scavolini! Fancy seeing you here today.”<br />
<br />
Michael growled, as the mayor and his advisors approached him. <br />
<br />
“Where’s your husband?” Adam asked mischievously. <br />
<br />
“Yeah” Dennis added with a snarl. “Where’s Freddy? I figured he’d want to be here today to see his son starring in a commercial. A commercial that&#39;s shooting here in town, thanks to efforts of the mayor.”<br />
<br />
“Plus” Marley added “he should be around town this week. That is, if he thinks his campaign is serious enough to continue on with to election day.”<br />
<br />
“He should just drop out of the race at this point” Adam said with a smirk. “He clearly doesn’t take it all that seriously, with his running off and what not.”<br />
<br />
The advisors chuckled, as Michael glared at them angrily. The mayor met his gaze with a wide smirk on his face. <br />
<br />
“He’ll be back soon” Michael replied with a curl in his voice. “You’ll be sorry when he beats you next week.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m not too worried about that happening anymore” the mayor said with confidence, as he stroked the Ruggeri ring on his finger. “In fact, I think that, when your husband reappears in this town, it will be in a state that will shock the conscious of America.”<br />
<br />
Michael stared at the mayor gently stroking the Ruggeri ring on his finger. He wanted to snatch it from him in that very moment, but decided that it was too dangerous to do it. Instead, he tried to play it cool, as Gary went to knock on Buddy’s trailer.<br />
<br />
“Tom!” Gary said, as he banged on the door. “An important visitor is here to see you!”<br />
<br />
Tom opened the trailer door and angrily glared at Gary.<br />
<br />
“Why are you banging on the door so loud?!” Tom scolded. “Lady is trying to take a nap in here!!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, there’s the man I’ve been looking for” the mayor said, as he and his advisors approached Tom. <br />
<br />
“No!!! Go away!!! You’ve caused me enough trouble as it is, asshole!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Is that any way to talk to the man in charge of this town?” Adam asked mischievously. <br />
<br />
“Yeah” Dennis concurred. “You better mind your manners. The mayor can have you arrested and thrown in jail.”<br />
<br />
“Especially since we let you off on facing charges for committing perjury earlier this year” Marley added.<br />
<br />
Tom gulped nervously, as he walked down the steps. <br />
<br />
“So” the mayor continued “where is the big star of the show today?”<br />
<br />
Buddy, who had been lying next to Lady in the trailer, perked up his ears. He looked out the open trailer door to see Tom talking to the mayor and his advisors. <br />
<br />
“There he is!” the mayor exclaimed when he spotted Buddy, as he pushed Tom aside and walked into the trailer. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Tom scolded, as the mayor’s advisors held him back. “Don’t do that! My other dog needs peace and quiet to get some shut eye!”<br />
<br />
“Oh” the mayor said to Buddy, ignoring Tom yelling at him. “You must be Buddy.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled loudly, with his teeth bared in a menacing manner. Lady whimpered nervously next to him, as she curled up on the dog bed. <br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, boy? Aren’t you happy to see me?”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked loudly, as the mayor bent down to look him directly in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“I bet you’ve been pretty bummed about being a dog these past two days, haven’t you, Freddy Benson?”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked loudly again, but the mayor did not flinch. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, my fellow political rival. Your commie ass won’t be stuck on all fours for that much longer.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled loudly, as he could see the mayor stroking the Ruggeri ring on his finger. <br />
<br />
“Soon enough, you’re going to be returning town, Freddy Benson. Your public re-emergence will ensure that you can never show your sorry, commie ass in this town of mine ever again.”<br />
<br />
The mayor chuckled loudly, as Buddy snapped in his direction. <br />
<br />
“Better be careful, Freddy. Wouldn’t want to get put down by the pound, would you?”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled loudly, as the mayor stood back up.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you again soon, Freddy. Looking forward to you trying to explain your way out of this one.”<br />
<br />
The mayor chuckled to himself, as he walked out of the trailer. When he was outside, he leaned into Tom and whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
“Not a very nice dog you got there, Tom.”<br />
<br />
“Not a very nice person you are, Mr. Mayor” he replied with a snort.<br />
<br />
The mayor ignored the slight, as he motioned to his advisors, who followed him to another part of the set. <br />
<br />
“Oh great” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy whimpered next Lady. “This is was what I was hoping would not happen today. I hope they have enough footage to air this commercial in case I change back again.”<br />
<br />
Lady whimpered and asked Buddy what was wrong. Buddy explained that the mayor was evil and trying to ruin Tom’s day. Lady said that if he needed to run off after him, she would act in his place for the commercial. Buddy appreciated the offer and would hold her to it, if need be. <br />
<br />
After the crew ended lunch, they set up the next shot in a wider area of the park. The PA’s, Gary and Monica, brought Tom, Buddy, Michael, Evan and his grandmother to set. Following closely behind them was the mayor, surrounded by his advisors. <br />
<br />
“How long are we going to be here for?” Dennis asked the mayor.<br />
<br />
“Long enough for Freddy Benson to make an appearance” the mayor replied. “Then, we’ll head back to the office.”<br />
<br />
The mayor chuckled, as his advisors gulped nervously. When they assembled by the wide, open space, the director came up to Evan and Buddy. <br />
<br />
“Have you ever played with a frisbee before, Evan?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Not really” Evan replied honestly.<br />
<br />
The director groaned, as he handed Evan the frisbee. <br />
<br />
“I want to get a few shots of you throwing the frisbee and Buddy catching it with his mouth. Think you can do that?”<br />
<br />
“I can try.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s go for rehearsal.”<br />
<br />
“Rehearsal!” a PA called out.<br />
<br />
Evan stood nervously in place, as Buddy looked over at the mayor. <br />
<br />
“Oh great” Freddy thought to himself. “The mayor is going to try to change me back right here as we’re filming. This is not good.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s try this out!” the director said, as he stood behind the camera operator. “Action!”<br />
<br />
Buddy looked up in anticipation, as Evan tried to properly hold the frisbee. When he flung it, it landed just a few feet away from him.<br />
<br />
“Stop! Evan, throw the frisbee!”<br />
<br />
“I’m trying” Evan retorted. <br />
<br />
Evan tried to throw the frisbee three more times, before a crew member tried to assist him. The mayor was getting impatient, as the cameras hadn’t started rolling yet. After multiple more attempts to help Evan throw the frisbee, the director let out a loud groan.<br />
<br />
“Come on, kid.”<br />
<br />
“I’m doing the best I can” Evan replied. <br />
<br />
“We don’t have time for this” a crew member said to the director. “Let’s sub in the stunt double.”<br />
<br />
“Stunt double!” a PA yelled. <br />
<br />
Monica, the PA, moved Evan out of the shot, as a man, of similar height to Evan, stepped into frame. He was dressed the same way as Evan and had the exact same hair cut as well. <br />
<br />
“Cool” Evan commented quietly to himself. “I have my own stunt double, like a real life superstar.”<br />
<br />
Buddy looked up at the stunt double, who gave him a short greeting. <br />
<br />
“Let’s shoot this!” the director said. <br />
<br />
“Perfect” the mayor thought to himself. “Here comes the money shot.”<br />
<br />
“Action!”<br />
<br />
The stunt double happily looked down at Buddy, before he aimed the frisbee. The mayor began to read the inscription on the back of the ring.<br />
<br />
“L’uomo al cane.”<br />
<br />
The stunt double tossed the frisbee out into the field. <br />
<br />
“Leggi l&#39;iscrizione.”<br />
<br />
Buddy began to chase after the frisbee that flew across the field in the air. <br />
<br />
“Camminare su quattro zampe!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ring began to glow on the mayor’s finger. Just as Buddy jumped up to catch the frisbee with his mouth, he could feel his fur begin to recede into his body.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy landed and paused in place. “I can’t change back now. I have to get out of here.”<br />
<br />
Dropping the frisbee out of his mouth, Buddy began turn towards the wooded area of the park.<br />
<br />
“Come back, boy!” the stunt double yelled. <br />
<br />
In a panic, Buddy dashed off away from the film shoot.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Tom yelled. <br />
<br />
“Go after that dog!” the director yelled, as crew members began to chase after him.<br />
<br />
“Oh good” the mayor thought to himself, as he urged his advisors to follow him. “Seems like this worked out after all.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Michael thought to himself, as he ran after Buddy.<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Evan called to him.<br />
<br />
“Wait here, Evan” Michael replied as he turned to him, before he ran off after the crew and the mayor’s posse. <br />
<br />
“I’ll stay with you, Evan” his grandmother said, as she held onto his shoulders tightly. <br />
<br />
As the assembled gathering of people chased after him, Buddy sped off as quickly as he could. He knew he couldn’t run on all fours for long, as his limbs were already beginning to change back to a human stance. With an immediate sense of relief, Buddy turned a corner and jumped into a nearby bush. When he landed, his knees popped back into place. He laid down in the shrubbed area and quietly tried to hide. <br />
<br />
“Buddy!” a crew member yelled out, as they scoured the wooded area. “Buddy, where did you go?!”<br />
<br />
Freddy felt the remainder of his fur retreat into his skin. His muzzle pushed back into his face and his ears returned to their position closer to his head. <br />
<br />
“Buddy!” Tom yelled. “Buddy! Why did you run off again?!”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down to see his penis return to normal. The furry sheath disappeared and his flacid, cut dick returned. It waved loosely on his groin. <br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch” the mayor said, as he tried to scour the woods with his advisors. “Where did that commie asshole run off to?”<br />
<br />
The assembled group tried to search the immediate area for Buddy, as Freddy’s changes finished up. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Freddy thought to himself, as his hands and feet returned back to normal. “Not now. I can’t let anybody see me like this. If they do, then my career and my life is over.”<br />
<br />
Feeling his now human face with his hands, Freddy gulped, as he heard someone approach the bush. As they got closer, his heart began feel as if it was pumping out of his chest. Soon enough, the branches of the bush spread apart.<br />
<br />
“This is it” Freddy thought to himself. “I’m done for.”<br />
<br />
When he peered out of the bush, Freddy saw….</p>
