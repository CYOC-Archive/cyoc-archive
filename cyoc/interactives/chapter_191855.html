<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia Steinberg was waiting a little bit outside of the Ferris Wheel making it obvious she was waiting for a pair to come out. She was tapping her toe a little impatient. After this stunt Quincy would have a lot to answer for, and probably wouldn&#39;t have one of these outside world visits for awhile. The next two people existed the Ferris Wheel and there was an olive skinned boy, dark hair, and piercing ice blue eyes. Bingo that was 5932-12... or at least a 5932 child, but what were the odds there were two of them here at the Ferris Wheel specifically? Thankfully their clothes were still on... Wait did Quincy have more clothes on? The Haze seemed to be a little thicker around Quincy&#39;s body for a second. She still wore the sweater dress, but she also wore a pair of running shoes and some leggings. Claudia theorized that Quincy may actually be wearing underwear too. There was other eyeball measurements she did. Claudia was still well developed for a roughly 16 year old, but just well developed. Of interest the Haze didn&#39;t seem to be messing with 5932-12&#39;s eyes. There was nothing out of the ordinary with an undercover 5 going on a date or something here. The two teens who at best should&#39;ve been a toddler and a baby just needed a stern look from their authority figure to freeze. <br />
&quot;That was very idiotic 456...&quot; The 3 stated and then paused waiting for Quincy to say something like Quincy&#39;s sorry  but there was just silence &quot;Sure this got some interesting data from the Lovely Wheel, but as a test subject yourself you may have just made yourself a 6!&quot;<br />
Pete glanced to the line and crowd around them and whispered &quot;Um... should you be shouting like that? This... haze doesn&#39;t stop them fr-&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh I know!&quot; Dr. Steinberg said &quot;But if you didn&#39;t realize it 6&#39;s don&#39;t actually matter! The civilization of icy blue eyed people like you that were a little bit special was just erased from history easily, because they were 6&#39;s! Quincy I have to tell my superiors about this and there&#39;s a chance you&#39;ll be downgraded to a 6! and Pete don&#39;t think you can do anything to help a 6. They don&#39;t matter and as a 5 you Barely matter.&quot; <br />
Quincy said &quot;Teacher... calm down your making Quincy scared.&quot; as she let herself fall into Pete&#39;s embrace. <br />
The Dr. continued her rambling &quot;Yes, you really should be scared. I&#39;m scared for you, because I don&#39;t think you understand how little a 6 actually matters to GET.&quot; <br />
Quincy said &quot;but I&#39;m not doing anything bad... how-&quot; her teacher held up a hand and took out her smartphone and started typing something to a 2. Quincy was confused, but Pete whose Agent knowledge had came back knew that GET had a lot of power and weren&#39;t afraid of indulging 3&#39;s, 4&#39;s, and certain senior 5&#39;s. The message was sent and suddenly people around them started to vaporize. Literally turning into water vapor leaving their clothes behind. It took a few seconds for everyone who heard the conversation to vaporize along with half the 6 population of the fair. There was a massive panic till the Haze kicked in. The piles of clothes on the ground disappeared, and the remaining 6&#39;s didn&#39;t see any reason to panic. It&#39;s not like anything had happened. Quincy shuddered with a look of terror on her face. Pete&#39;s eyes dimmed again. He was special, but it still took days to get somewhat of a haze resistance. It usually took at least a year to develop a mental immunity to haze. <br />
Pete asked &quot;Something happened didn&#39;t it?&quot; <br />
Dr. Steinberg calmed her voice and said &quot;Yes, I&#39;m going to have to talk to my superiors and do my best to explain why Quincy should still be a test subject. Not a 6. Go talk to your Uncle about sleeping arrangements. I need some privacy for now.&quot; Then she walked away to go to an Onsight bunker to go update her 2 on this. It&#39;s very possible she was making a mountain out of a mole hill, but this did pose a risk of dirtying the Quim experiment. Since 1 never did anything directly it was the 2&#39;s that had the final say on this sort of thing. <br />
<br />
As the 3 walked away Pete held and patted Quincy as he asked &quot;You tired? We can go ask... Uncle about a place to rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
The accommodations were surprisingly really nice. The dorm for the T3 testing grounds was a portable bunker of sorts. Kaine walked the couple down into the shared living quarters, and handed Pete a key. &quot;You got room 49 down that hall. There&#39;s also a bathroom in your room, and you&#39;re free to let Quincy sleep with you tonight.&quot; <br />
Pete said &quot;I can&#39;t belie-... wait is that?&quot; Pete saw Kaine pull out a weird remote and then Pete&#39;s body felt odd again. A little shorter, and as he looked down there were bulges on his chest and his clothes felt all wrong. &quot;The heck did you turn me into a girl?!?&quot; <br />
Kaine smirked and said &quot;Hey, wouldn&#39;t want you to do anything to Dr. Steinburg&#39;s project you might regret can I?&quot; <br />
Quincy noticed Pete&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t dim and said &quot;Pete you remembered you&#39;re a man!&quot; Pete would&#39;ve been confused if it weren&#39;t thanks to a fuzziness over a number of details. <br />
Kaine explained &quot;Bunker has a Haze filter at the entrance. No need to hide things from 6&#39;s, and it&#39;s better that we&#39;re as aware of any changes as possible. Come see me tomorrow and I&#39;ll change you back.&quot; The 4 would enjoy seeing Pete walk out of the bunker and have the Haze modify his thoughts and clothes into that of a girl... However he needed to get back to the fair. As little as the lives of 6&#39;s mattered Dr. Steinburg&#39;s stunt made today lower in revenue, and would make a lot of experiments take longer than expected. It was now up to him to adjust everything. As the man exited the Bunker he looked up at the sky and there were a lot of clouds... Might be a rainy day tomorrow thanks to the extra water vapor which&#39;ll put more things on hold... That was the problem with people too high in the organization. They were so used to playing god they didn&#39;t always think of all the consequences of their actions. Kaine had to wonder how much of this he could put the blame on Dr. Steinburg.</p>
