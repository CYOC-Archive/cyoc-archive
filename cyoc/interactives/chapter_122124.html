<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up in my crib in total darkness feeling slightly peckish. As my mind tried to take back control of itself, I felt the warmth of the girls holding me as they each slept. Kerrie and Sydney were both content and asleep holding on to me as if I were a comforting teddy bear. I admired the beauty of Kerrie&#39;s face. She had sandy light brown hair and deep brown eyes and a sweetness that revealed the perfect innocence of her youth. She was a real baby, not a man with a magic coin like me. Her and her sister were the potential for a wonderful future. For them, toddlerhood would be a passing phase. But for me, this was truly the life of bliss.<br />
<br />
Sydney noticed I was awake and started kissing my hand and suddenly she started trilling as if to ask what was wrong. Suddenly Kerrie started crying loudly and she grabbed me and kissed my face. I could feel the tears dripping from her face everywhere. Sydney pulled me back towards her and tried to kiss me as well, but mostly she got drool on me, a lot.<br />
<br />
I was getting annoyed because the passing fun of a visit was wearing off, and I wanted my mommy. Where was Jesse to put me at ease? Brianne was beautiful and all but I definitely knew she was dumb and perpetually horny. Had I known that this wasn&#39;t a &quot;playdate&quot;, this was an attempt by Jesse to escape by dumping me on her for a day or so. <br />
<br />
I decided to solve things and get a little bit of fun at the same time. I was happy I still had the coin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Brianne would give me a sticky when she changes me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Brianne would replace Kerrie&#39;s mom in every way and that no one would notice or care where Susan went.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne&#39;s long voluptuous legs walked quickly down the hallway as she slid the door open.  &quot;What&#39;s going on in here, cuties? Mama&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up Kerrie and Sydney each separately and pulled them each to her for a moment, allowing both of the girls to each have a mommy moment. &quot;My Kerrie, my Sydney.&quot; She gently ran her fingers through the girls hair, massaging their scalps lovingly and sniffed their skin, admiring the beautiful new baby smell.  &quot;Oh, I smell what&#39;s wrong...Good job Kerrie! You are such a good pooper. Yes you are. You have always pooped so well, since the day you were born. Such a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kerrie bubbled at the praise. Kerrie loved Brianne even before this all happened, because one thing she lavished on Kerrie was attention and affection and it brought Brianne a great, perverse pleasure to build a stronger relationship with Susan&#39;s daughter than Susan had. She secretly nursed her alone (never in the view of anyone else, even Sydney) to build an intense bond with her, build her confidence and undermine her relationship with Susan. It worked. And now, Susan was no more. As if to confirm it I noticed a huge, expensive looking engagement/wedding band on Brianne&#39;s ring finger with large diamonds on them.<br />
<br />
Sydney wailed, hunger knawing at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, girls. Boob and then diaper change, but you&#39;ve gotta remember, we&#39;re guests here. Marky needs milky first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne winked and smiled at me. Deep down inside she was a pleaser, she felt practically designed to please men. Perhaps she still saw me as one. She was still wearing the &quot;boob hammock&quot; though, and with my hunger growing at rapid pace I wasn&#39;t one to say &quot;ladies first&quot;. She picked me up and caressed me a while, kissing me lovingly and letting me nuzzle her bare tit as she carefully positioned me underneath those beauties. Brianne sniffed my messy cloth diaper and was taken aback for a few moments like a non-drug user taking a hit of heroin for the first time. Her pupils dialated, and she had a dreamy slurring to her speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm....Marky....such a messy baby. Your poopies are so yummy. Can I eat your poopies, baby boy? Will you let me eat your poopies, cutie?&quot; she looked at me in that needy, dreamy state that turned me on and then answered her own question. &quot;First I&#39;ll feed you, then the girls, get you all back to bed, then eat your poopies! YAY!&quot;<br />
<br />
The way she said that I could tell Rick enjoyed her because she was child-like, stupid and easy to control. She was perfectly happy being a living, breathing baby oven and sex doll. She was even more aroused than usual while feeding me and I could see Sydney was hungry and her jealousy burned, so I pulled Brianne&#39;s soft downy yellow hair and looked over at her crying daughter with a sympathetic eye. Baby Marky definitely considered Sydney his girlfriend at this point, so he motioned for her to nurse the tit he had just gotten off of. Brianne smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like your husband wants me to feed you now, babygirl.&quot; Husband? Even as I wondered about that remark, Brianne put Syd next to me in the &quot;boob hammock&quot; and I felt Sydney&#39;s hand rub my cheek, encouraging me to feed while rubbing drool on my face. Brianne giggled, in utter bliss.  Suddenly I gathered Sydney into my arms and did the same thing for her supporting her head in the perfect position to flood milk into her mouth and speed her digestion. Sydney grew tired, grunting in want of sleep as baby Marky kissed her just before her eyes shut. Baby Marky was clearly aroused by all the husband/wife talk, and he reached his hand in Sydney&#39;s diaper. Suddenly Brianne sprung into action, slapping Baby Marky&#39;s hand hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no no, baby boy, if you do that again I will tell her father, and he&#39;ll make you get married with his shotgun, do you hear me?&quot; she smiled saying that, sending somewhat of a mixed message, but clearly that was one line I should not cross.<br />
<br />
Baby Marky cried softly as Brianne deprived him of the comfort of doing what he intended, but with him and Sydney both fed she let them sleep through a diaper change and gave Kerrie a private feeding and some alone time with Mommy.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, she ate my poopies after Kerrie&#39;s feeding, in case you were wondering. Luckily Brianne isn&#39;t that stupid.<br />
