<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I took a deep breath and decided that the urges that had filled me (after touching the poor girl/boy) had been the result of being to tired and to excited at the same time. After all, this &quot;woman&quot; was actually a 16 year old boy! He'd been altered in some way I didn't understand (though I suspected a mixture of surgery and drugs) into this fat little peasant woman...<br />
<br />
   Granted...she was very cute. Gomez Padraza had gotten his moneys worth with the boy. Her body - though very fat - was also very lush and inviting. Her breasts were huge, and the two good looks at them that he'd gotten had shown him that they were beautifully shaped and delightfully bouncy.<br />
<br />
   Her belly, butt and thighs were all well-rounded and soft. Her dark hair was a thick, tumbling mass now that her bun had come undone.<br />
<br />
   She saw me looking at her in the mirror, and she said in Spanish &quot;You think I'm attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I blushed &quot;Well...yes. I know you're really a young boy...but I have to say that your still very desirable.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She smiled and looked pained. &quot;That's just part of his spell. He made me so big and fat so that I'd be embarrassed to even think of going home...but he also enchanted me so that any gringo who touched me would want to...keep touching me. And the farther we get from the village...the more you'll want to touch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Magic doesn't exist.&quot; I said emphatically. &quot;The only power Gomez has over you is the power you give him.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She smiled, as if she was listening to a child telling her stories, then she said &quot;I gave birth to these babies just three weeks ago. I was born a Yankee Gringo, but the powers of Gomez Padraza made me a girl...then a mother. You my not believe in magic, but I've had to much experience with it to ever disbelieve.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I felt bad for the kid. The poor girl...I mean guy...had really fallen for all this magic stuff. He must have been brainwashed to believe that he'd given birth to those kids.<br />
<br />
   Speaking of which, those kids would be a problem. Maybe more than Juanita, Gomez would be coming after his sons. Perhaps I should try and return them to him? I'd have to wait till later, though. Because with Juanita thinking they were also &quot;Hers&quot;, I'd have a heck of a time getting them from...<br />
<br />
   A sudden boom followed by a lurch told me that we'd just lost a tire. Juanita screamed and clutched her babies tightly to her bosom and I slowed the car and pulled over.<br />
<br />
   The tire was shredded.<br />
<br />
   &quot;It...must have been something we hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Juanita began to cry, and she shook her head. &quot;It was the powers of Gomez Padraza! He'll never let me go! He'll haunt me forever! Why, oh why did I ever leave? Now you'll be in trouble as well...and if I ever do get home, then my family will suffer at his hands! Leave me here, my brave protector. I'll wait for him to come for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I was touched by her concern, but I knew an ordinary blowout when I saw one. &quot;It'll be fine, kid. There's a town within walking distance - a little place called Castronegro - and we can get a car there. We're within 20 miles of the Texas border right now. We'll have you home very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She sniffed back her tears, then nodded. It was plain that she wanted to be told that everything was going to be alright. The poor girl wanted...no NEEDED my help. All her old male swagger and pride had been replaced with a girlish need to be protected. Whatever they'd done to this boy, it had been just as much mental as it was physical.<br />
<br />
   I reached to take her hand, and she drew back.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Oh, right...&quot; I quipped &quot;If I touch you, then I'll want to fuck you again. Wasn't that the spell Gomez put you under?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Do not make fun, seinor. The powers of Gomez Padraza are very great.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I sighed, then stepped back and let her exit the car herself. We walked the half mile to the town of Castronegro, and I worked-out a cover story for us. I was a tourist returning from Mexico, and she was the girl I'd accidently married while drunk. I'd decided to do the honest think and was taking her back home with me.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If it were true, it would be very honorable, seinor. I am glad that my new husband is such a gentleman.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I looked at her and saw she was grinning. We both laughed, and I thought once again just how beautiful she was. She had the natural glow of a madonna, and her every movement was both motherly and affectionate.<br />
<br />
   I suddenly realized that I wanted her. I didn't care that she was actualy a boy, I WANTED HER!<br />
<br />
   Taking a deep breath, I walked towards a gas station and after exchanging some money and a few words of spanish I convinced the guy to go down the road and get my car. If all went well, we'd be back on the road by morning.<br />
<br />
   Then we went to a local hotel and signed in as &quot;John and Juanita Smith&quot; (these Mexicans don't know one gringo name from another) before taking our room. <br />
<br />
   She changed the babies diapers and I got an American station on the television. She waddled towards the bed and watched the television with me for awhile, before saying with a sigh &quot;I don't know what they're saying. Gomez took all my English and replaced it with Spanish.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;That's not possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;You will learn the truth of Gomez Padraza's powers eventualy.&quot; she said, before stripping to her bra and panties and crawling into bed.<br />
<br />
   I looked at her again...and once again I felt pure lust fill my hart. I tried not to do it...but I undressed as well...and slid into bed beside her.<br />
<br />
   She looked suprised at first...but she smiled and said sadly &quot;You can't resist his magic. I understand...but I warn you...this isn't the only spell I'm under.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I couldn't controll myself. I removed her bra and panties as tenderly as I could, and every time I touched her skin I felt a little electric shock of pleasure.<br />
<br />
   She spread her legs and hefted her belly (&quot;THIS IS A GUY!!!&quot; my mind wailed, helplessly &quot;HE'S ONLY 16!!! THIS IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS!!!&quot;) as I lowered myself into her. We both gasped, then smiled. Why had we resisted? It was so natural. She was such a pretty little chicana now, and she obviously wanted me as much as I wanted her.<br />
<br />
   We made love several times, each time we did we both came with a gush and a cry. She was made for me, and I for her. We never should have resisted. we were perfect for each other.<br />
<br />
   The next morning...</p>
