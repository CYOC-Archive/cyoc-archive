<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy, Maria, Raul, and Lia had boarded the plane to head to Philidelphia. About midway through they found that they had a couple stowaways. They had discovered that Snowflake and Janice had snuck on board in a attempt to go with their mother, but got on the wrong plane. Raul was upset but not by much. In the long run he understood their sense of adventure. He had contacted their parents, and fortunately he found that this may be an advantage for them. &quot;So you want to help, do you?&quot; He asked. &quot;Well, little ones, your sister was your age when shi went on hir first mission to Cairo, Janice, so perhaps we could use your help.&quot; He paced back and forth then looked. &quot;Infact, I know what  you two can do. Your moms and dads have you two watch the orphanage, do they not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Janice nodded. &quot;Only the real young ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raul, I think I got a better idea. There will be places you nor I, and certainlly Lia and Sammy can&#39;t get to.Therefore...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea love.&quot; He looked. &quot;However, this does even things up.&quot; He looks. &quot;Maria, you, Sammy and I will take North Phili, while our two stowaways and Lia take South Phili. We&#39;ll rondevue at Independence Hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea, Raul,&quot; Lia said. &quot;But perhaps one of the two should go with you, and Sammy with me, or you, or Maria, that way I don&#39;t get overwelmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do have a valid point.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Then Sammy will go with you. Snowflake will go with us. Now look,&quot; he spoke softer to Snowflake and Janice. &quot;If you&#39;re told to run, don&#39;t you dare stop. You just run as fast as your feet can get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both nodded.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was around noon when they landed in Phili. The instant they arived at the airport they found they were thankful it was empty. They made their way out and onto the streets. Raul looked at them. &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll part here. Remember, Janice, we have limited darts, so aim carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded. &quot;Y... yes sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice,&quot; Lia looked at hir. &quot;Relax. You&#39;ll do fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi nuzzled into Lia. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that the two teams parted ways heading to the northern and southern most part of Philidelphia. Deciding to meet at Independence Hall.<br />
<br />
Once at their starting point Janice had her small gun ready as the trio started north. They were right. Janice with hir small body was helpful. There were areas they had to vaccinate that Lia and Sammy couldn&#39;t get to. &quot;Well done, Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice came back with a smile. &quot;Now I see why mom wants me to wait.&quot; Shi shivered some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, don&#39;t worry, when you get older,  you&#39;ll be loving the thing you just saw. Only not through lust.&quot; Sammy giggled as she spoke to Janice. &quot;Soon you and Snowflake will see it as a beautiful thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded. &quot;Shall we get to the next street?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia smiled. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice smiled as shi walked by hir sister in-law on the right and Sammy on the left. The two acted as barriers to protect hir, but when it came time, Janice had proved to be a big help. Grant it, though, the runt still did sneak onto a plane. Once they hit central Phili they started back to make sure they hadn&#39;t missed anything. Unlike New York, these weren&#39;t dino based. These were more along the lines of what looked to resemble some mythical creatures. Well, to a small degree. Creatures such as a unicorn, how they got a unicorn was beyond them, but Sammy and Lia assumed that this must&#39;ve been something that happened similar to Sammy. For there are no records of Unicorns truely existing in anything but fantasy. However, on closer inspection, these weren&#39;t the typical mythical unicorns. Their hides were like that of the various horses that dotted the land, only with a spiraled horn, just no magic. They however appeared to be susseptible to the lust side and, to Sammy and Lia&#39;s surprise, they were just reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think that.... perhaps... they stumbled on something like with you, Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possible. But what would they run across? A horn? And if so, what would they do? I mean can&#39;t exactly....&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy looked spotting a colt. Shi was fairly young. Infact shi was younger than Janice. The colt ran up and asked if Janice could play. Sammy had smiled as the three were needing a break anyway, and nodded. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice smiled and the two went to play on the playground, even though there were somethings they couldn&#39;t play on. While they did another, around Sammy and Lia&#39;s age walked up. &quot;Amazing, aren&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed they are.&quot; Lia smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I take it you&#39;re babysitters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of. Shi&#39;s my sister in-law.&quot; Lia smiled. &quot;Say, how come you&#39;re not... as lust filled?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, we were willing people who wanted the change. It was an experimental serum to create something that didn&#39;t exist.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So there&#39;s a branch of CI here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;A good sized one. But it&#39;s ment to give serums out. Not to cause the outbreaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy looked. &quot;Do you think you and your friends could help us vaccinate those that need it here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly. I&#39;m Jezzabell and the little one is my daughter, Alia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sammy, and this is Lia, and the little one is Janice.&quot; Sammy smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;A most wonderful pleasure Sammy.&quot; Shi shook hir head. This Unikat had the colorations of a pinto. Regadless of what a Unicorn&#39;s colors was, this one was amazing.<br />
<br />
Jezza and the two became fast friends. Apparently the rest regarded Jezza as the leader of the herd or something like that, and told them they are going to work. In a matter of hours the south side of Philidelphia was vaccinated.<br />
<br />
Lia thought of a way to repay Jezza and hir friends, and thought of only one. &quot;Jezza, do you and the others enjoy the city?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so much. We&#39;d go to the plains but we have no way to get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy smiled. &quot;Well, we know a place you&#39;d be most welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Jezza giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most definately.&quot; Sammy smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll call in and you can take our ride home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy smiled and did that, and escorted Jezza and their friends to the plane. &quot;Do you think you can take Janice home with you girls? Shi should&#39;ve stayed but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the least we can do. So who do we talk to when we get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk to Snowy or Maurice. You&#39;ll know them well when you get to the lab.&quot; Lia said. &quot;Janice can show you.&quot; Shi smiled and patted the little Kat on the head. &quot;May I ask, why a Unikat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as a girl a Unicorn was very beautiful. I seen this ad and took it. And now here I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Raul, Maria, and Snowflake were having their own string of luck. They were in Northwest Philidelphia. Unlike southern Philidelphia, Northern Philidelphia was resembling more and more of equines. Some people even looked like true centaur, upper torso of a woman, and lower torso of a horse. They got vaccinated all the same. &quot;Someone is into fantasy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That or the stuff they used has this effect on them. This seems they are using Dino DNA along with various other DNA strands. I just got a message from Lia that they ran into something similar, only unlike most equikats, and by most what we encountered, had a spiraled horn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowflake looked. &quot;Like a unicorn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, dear.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.... our guy is strange indeed.&quot; Raul said softly, pacing back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It said here that they volunteered to become Unikats. And thus far no lustful side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Snowflake started. &quot;A unicorn is the purest of animals. Perhaps whoever did that, had that in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken, Snowflake.&quot; Raul smiled. &quot;And seeing as they volunteered, let&#39;s just assume he&#39;s not our target at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were vaccinating left and right. Raul had the left,a nd Maria had the Right while Snowflake had the center. As they went, Maria had noticed that Snowflake&#39;s fur started to change color. Particularly a spot over the eye. When shi looked close she noted a snowflake shape mark. &quot;Well, that&#39;s cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Snowflake looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your eye dear. You have a snowflake patch.&quot; Shi smiled.<br />
<br />
Snowflake giggled. &quot;I know. It&#39;s been getting darker.&quot; Shi walked as they managed to vaccinate several as they went along. Snowflake smiled as shi managed, somehow, to get more than Raul and Maria put together. The two smiled as they walked with Snowflake, who was starting to tire out.<br />
<br />
Maria then helped Snowflake up to her lowerback so she didn&#39;t have to walk. Once they stopped to rest, Snowflake took a sigh of relief, rubbing each of hir paws. &quot;These streets hurt my feet. I&#39;m used to the pavement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and me both, dear.&quot; Maria giggled. &quot;You know, I&#39;m starting to feel rather thankful you two did come with. We&#39;ve covered a whole lot of ground with you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree.&quot; Raul spoke up.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After they rested for an hour they went back at it. Deciding to meet them back at the airport instead of Independence hall, Raul and Maria took Snowflake with them. They had just arrived as they were getting onto the plane and told Snowflake to go with Janice. The two stowaways went with ears pinned when Lia looked. &quot;Don&#39;t be sad, you two did excelent work. Your moms will be proud of you. Though upset you left without their knowledge but proud on how helpful you were.&quot; Lia said. The two nodded and boarded.<br />
<br />
Once the plane was gone they decided to finish up there and hop on a bus to New York to give help there.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Janice and Snowflake had made it back to Janice and showed the Unikats the area, they had found it rather pleasant. The two that played with Janice and hir mother had made a home in town while the rest ran the fields. Snowy was waiting for them at the door of Sally and Charlie&#39;s house, hands on hir hips. &quot;You two are in so much trouble that I&#39;m proud of you.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;I&#39;m glad you two wanted to help. And well, I think you two are growing very responsible. But...&quot; Shi started. &quot;If you so much as try that stunt again, I will take you two and shave a spot over your tail and whip you until you both are black and blue. Have I made myself clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mom.&quot; &quot;Yes Snowy.&quot; They both said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now get in there and get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two did so, Snowy had decided to have her and Maurice, as well as everyone else&#39;s cubs/kits and other children stay in Sally and Charlie&#39;s, considering it was the largest. So it was a house full of children.<br />
<br />
The two went in to wash up and headed to bed. The Unikat took little time for hir and hir daughter to get comfortable. Snowflake and Janice asked if shi could stay the night, and Jezza thought that since Alia and Janice touched off fairly well, that shi had no problem with it. Which Alia and Pinkie managed to touch off on highly good terms and became fast friends. Janice, Snowflake, snuggled togethere, and Alia and Pinkie were sitting watching a movie together while the others slept. They had thought it was going to be an interesting time now. Especially with their new friends.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Raul, Maria, Lia and Sammy wrapped things up and Philidelphia, they had now arrived at the base in Long Island, where they met up with the Secretary of Defence. &quot;Greetings Maria. Raul. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here. I know you just arrived, but I must ask of you to head to Boston, and meet the northern spreading head on. Chris and Christina have headed to Hartford, and by my reports the Breakout has yet to reach Boston. But if you can work from there, southward, you should beat them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raul nodded. &quot;Yes sir, however, would you mind if we rested first. I may be youthful, but this has tired me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly. Rest up and head out come morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
