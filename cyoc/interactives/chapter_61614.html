<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly and I didn't know what to make of it when we were given an anonymous reservation to the most fancy restaurant you could get without it <br />
having a dress code.  There were no ominous conditions like 'come alone' or any sort of threat. It was simply a reservation that the restaurant <br />
said was made in our names as guests. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guests of who exactly?&quot; I asked over the phone. <br />
<br />
I will never forget what I heard next as long as I live.  It had to be the most absurd and glaringly alias in the history of the human language. In <br />
other words, they wanted to know it wasn't their real name. <br />
<br />
The reservation had been arranged for when I and Molly would both have time off from our work. <br />
<br />
We didn't get nearly as many glares or looks as would have a year ago. <br />
<br />
Peaceful violin music played in the background, the scent of flowers and soap and oiled wood was almost overpowering. A reservation at a <br />
place like this wasn't easy to come by or cheap.<br />
<br />
The man already sitting at the table when the waiter guided us to our table was practically draped over his chair. He wore semi-transparent <br />
sunglasses, fine gloves, and a dark blue suit with tie. His lanky build made it hard for me to tell his age. He was also wearing a generous <br />
amount of perfume, making it impossible for me to pick up his scent through it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good Sir. Miss Molly. Please sit down.&quot; He said in a polite voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are?&quot; I asked remembering how friendly Beauregard had seemed at first.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is of no significance. I'm just here as a mouth piece. I've been brought into service merely to speak on behalf of those I am speaking <br />
for. Which I am under a agree of no confidence not to divulge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd still like to know who you are exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just someone whose been very good at being nobody all their life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People who hide things aren't exactly to be trusted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For shame good sir. That is the excused used by the King of France to exterminate the Knight Templar and seize their assists,  among their <br />
other crimes at the time such as not slaughtering Muslims who surrendered.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt you'd have gone to all this trouble for a history lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. But please first sit down. It's best not talk about these things on an empty stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're big eaters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I won't leave you with the bill.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Says the man who won't give his name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's mostly for the sake of 'don't shoot the messenger.' Let's the message stand on it's own. Besides, isn't this overtly complex for a <br />
ambush or prank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also for a discussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. Now can we order before we starve to death please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course myself and Molly ordered steak, rare, repeatedly. Our host ordered steak well done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we're all settled.&quot; Said our host sipping on red wine from a tall glass. &quot;I came here by behalf of my higher authority if you please talk <br />
with Miss Leona in allowing her creation to not remain hidden in a safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good-bye.&quot; We started to leave.<br />
<br />
He didn't even flinch. &quot;I can appreciated you not wanting to be used. But would you at least hear a man out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I looked at each other and sat back down. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not part of the grass roots group that want the mistake of Leona's formula being let out, there's no way they could afford this.&quot; Molly <br />
said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't say if I am or not. But I'm sure you can guess. And so we're all on the same page, please tell me in your own words precisely why you <br />
don't want Miss Leona's formula to let loose on an unprepared civilization?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's insane! Molly and I had our DNA altered and now there are people who want it done on PURPOSE?! They're idiots! They think it's <br />
some kind of fantasy. They don't recognize the dangers or the risks of new instincts or the practical problems of a new body!&quot;<br />
<br />
He gestured at me, &quot;And yet YOU stand before me. You and your wife. A perfectly rational, perfectly reasonable, productive, functional <br />
responsible, up standing members of society. You've proven better than your instincts, for an animal that isn't even supposed to be greatly <br />
social to begin with. You are as you've proven in court and to the community, that you are in full control of your instincts and have not lost your <br />
ethnic or morality to your new brain. It is rather arrogant my good sir to assume that only you, someone who had no intention of being this <br />
way, and was caught totally off guard being this way, can handle themselves while someone who has a somewhat vague idea of what's coming <br />
and is openly seeking it will not.&quot; <br />
<br />
I didn't know if he knew if I was the way I was due to Molly and not Changes but I wasn't about to let him know if he didn't. <br />
<br />
&quot;IF we could go back to being human we would.&quot; Molly injected.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is not remotely the point.&quot; He sipped the wine, &quot;The point is. Is that the two of you are the walking, breathing, living proof that even <br />
in it's crude state Miss Leona's formula does not turn the person into a sociopath or leave them mentally retarded. If you truly believe that <br />
these people who WANT to be transformed will, by default, or a significant percentage of them, would NOT be able to handle themselves due to <br />
the law of averages, then you and your wife should have stayed isolated from the general public and not have not been let near others until vast <br />
amounts of every possible mental and psychological test had been done on you and the rest of Changes victims. And yet you were let out <br />
among your fellow people, and here you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think you know what you're talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me the turn about, but what makes you? For you this state is a curse because it was FORCED on you. But for others who want to make <br />
their own choice, whose to judge before the fact?  I don't expect you for one moment to just change your point of view from what I've said. That <br />
only happens in the movies. I merely hope that after you've emotionally responded to someone contradicting you on something you feel greatly <br />
about, you'll -then- think about what I said and wonder if someone who thinks differently from you just -might- actually possible against all <br />
odds have a point.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You sound high and mighty.&quot;<br />
<br />
He bowed his head, &quot;I deeply apologize if I come across as so then. That's why I refuse to give my name. For you can judge what I say on what <br />
I say rather than myself. 'Ad hominid' is not limited to the political arena after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you're being avatar for whoever just because you were paid?&quot; I asked incredulous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please. A man is nothing without his conscience. And for the record, I DO think the majority of people who want this don't know what they're <br />
asking for. A new gender, a new body, a new species, a new suit of clothes, different colored hair, new colored eyes: none of these things lead <br />
to happiness or fulfillment unto themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then WHY?&quot; <br />
<br />
He leaned no closer, the light glaring off his sunglasses, &quot;Ever read the short story about a man in ancient China who invented a flying machine <br />
thousands of years ahead of it's time? The Emperor had him executed and his machine destroyed to keep what he saw as a dangerous <br />
technology from spreading. And just give some real life comparison, the Pope at one point banned Crossbows due to them making it possible <br />
for anyone to kill a knight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What point are you trying to make already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm getting there. . . . When the atomic bomb first came into existence, the average American at first didn't think about the possibility of that <br />
monopoly on atomic weapons would end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to your point!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to get revved up. And I apologize again. My point is this. Since you weren't hidden under a rug, that means every biologist in the <br />
world knows you exist. Which means they know it's POSSIBLE!  Super-instant-gene-therapy and customizing your species and body. Others <br />
now that they know it's possible will be doing their best to reach that plateau as well.  It's going to be years away, not decades, sorry, just <br />
accept that.  And here's something else. As long as it's forbidden and hidden away, it'll be the forbidden fruit, that which people will crave <br />
BECAUSE it's forbidden!&quot; <br />
<br />
Your entire misadventure with the lunatic proved to every single person out there The White that your new forms are NOTHING to be afraid of <br />
who didn't buy The Black of the lunatic's argument you're dangerous monsters. NOTHING! Do you understand? That means anything you say <br />
now about them being dangerous or untrustworthy will just seem like you wanting to keep it for yourselves.   Others WILL develop this <br />
technology, and NOT lifetimes from now!&quot; He calmed down caught his breath and collected himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like a natural occurring forest fire.  The longer you delay it, the more the dry underbrush will collect, and when that spark happens, it'll be <br />
a firestorm. Unless you release it in a controlled, secure way, and establish a legal basis on the use of such technology, people will just keep <br />
pushing for it until it breaks. And unless they can get it here, others WILL be ultimately able to provide it for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leaned back at last. And took out money to pay for the dinner. &quot;It's your choice now. You can say how much to yourselves or to me how <br />
wrong or misguided or selfish I am. Or you can pretend this night never happened and go off down a completely different path. Or maybe, just <br />
maybe, you can actually consider what I have to say says more than 'I contradict what you believe.'  Good-night.&quot; He stood up, bowed with his <br />
arms at his sides, and left.</p>
