<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wakeup sleepyhead we have a big day&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Sarah&quot; What was wrong with my voice? What&#39;s in my face? Hair and lot&#39;s of it. I sat up. The weight and wobble on my chest reminded me that I was no longer Zach. I was no longer Rod either. I was Rhonda, skinny Rhonda. I pulled the hair out of my face and sat up. I was in bed beside Sarah. I was wearing a lavender nightie. I felt my chest. I had breasts. I was most definitely female.<br />
I looked at Sarah. Big breasted Sarah. She had used the medallion to enhance her breast size and I had not yet had a chance to play with them. I reached across and felt her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;No time for that&quot; said Sarah &quot;We are going dress shopping this morning&quot; She gently pushed my hands away &quot;Besides you no longer have the required equipment&quot; She was grinning at me. &quot;Get up and have a shower, and wash your hair. I&#39;ll find some clothes for you to wear&quot;<br />
.........<br />
Once out of the shower I found the hair dryer on the bed along with a plain bra and panty set, a light , pleated, thigh length skirt, with a matching top. I could hear Sarah having a shower in the other room. I took the hint and dried my abundant hair before getting dressed. <br />
Sarah came in as I was pulling on the top and said &quot;Choose some comfy shoes as we might be doing a lot of walking&quot; She took the dryer back to the bathroom and soon I could hear her drying her hair.<br />
<br />
I looked through her shoe supply and selected some white sneakers, grabbed some socks and put them on. I made my way to the kitchen and prepared some muesli for breakfast. I had just started to eat when Sarah came in. She was looking good in a pink and white patterned knee length dress.<br />
<br />
She helped herself to some cereal and sat down across from me. &quot;While you were in the shower I rang my friend Amy. You have an appointment at her salon at 8.30&quot; I had met Amy before. She was a school friend who had started her own hair salon recently. &quot;You should use the hairband you wore last night&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished breakfast and got up to get the hairband. As I was walking back toward the bedroom Sarah said &quot;Whoa. Stop there sister!  ........ Sneakers will not do with that outfit. Haven&#39;t you any fashion sense at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said wear comfy shoes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the expense of looking like a dork. Get those off, I&#39;ll find you something&quot; She went into the guest bedroom and came back with a pair of blue sandals with a 1 inch heel. &quot;These will work much better&quot; She ended up choosing me a handbag to match the outfit as well.<br />
<br />
As we drove around to the salon she said that for Karen&#39;s party tonight would be based around her pool and that the dress code was beach wear. I could wear some board shorts and a tee-shirt but she was toying with the idea of wearing her grass skirt again. However if she did that she would need some new bikini&#39;s as her old ones were now a bit small. She wanted to look in a beachwear shop and could do that while I was getting my hair done. <br />
<br />
I was surprised at the size of Amy&#39;s salon when we pulled up. Sarah explained that Amy had formed a partnership with some other girls so that they could provide the whole spa experience. She also said I could actually sell my hair to the salon. As it was so long and thick, the hair could be used to make a wig. Sarah said she would come in and help to negotiate a deal.<br />
<br />
We entered and must have been the 1st customers for the day as only Amy was present. Sarah introduced me &quot;Hi Amy, this is my friend Rhonda from Adelaide I was telling you about. She has decided on a change of look. How much do you think her hair is worth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Rhonda. You have magnificent hair. How short are you willing to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to go short......&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were thinking a short Bob style&quot; cut in Sarah.<br />
<br />
Amy measured my hair and bunched it up like a ponytail &quot;Have you ever had this dyed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked me up and down &quot;I could do a nice layered bob to chin length and we could add a complimentary makeover, manicure and wax for $300. What do you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Ummm...&quot; No way I was thinking.  I&#39;ve never paid more than $20 for a haircut in my life. How do I phrase this. <br />
<br />
Amy must have seen the look on my face &quot;Make it $350&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal&quot; said Sarah. She pulled me into the corner and whispered in my ear &quot;They will pay you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will this take&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe 2 hours&quot; said Amy<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be back a bit after 10. See you later&quot; said Sarah<br />
<br />
Some other women had arrived at the salon and Amy introduced them to me &quot;This is Angie and Liz&quot; She explained to to them the deal she had made with me. &quot;I&#39;ll just cut the hair off then leave you to Liz. When she has finished, I&#39;ll style you and Angie can do your nails&quot; <br />
She bade me sit in a chair and said &quot;Are you sure about this. There is no going back&quot; <br />
<br />
I said &quot;Go ahead&quot; She promptly cut off my hair at the top of my neck. She immediately took the 2 feet of hair to a back room. My head felt so much lighter.<br />
<br />
Liz approached and led me to a cubicle. She told me to &quot;Strip off and put on a gown, you clothes and bag will be safe here&quot;  I did as she bade, leaving only my bra and panties on under the white toweling gown.<br />
<br />
Liz then led me to another room and said &quot;Take off the gown&quot;  She inspected my body, front and back. &quot;You have magnificent skin. You have no sun damage at all&quot; she then added &quot;I guess you have never had a wax before either&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I haven&#39;t&quot; I replied &quot;I&#39;m a bit apprehensive&quot; I was determined that I would not scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try and relax and lie on you stomach&quot; she indicated a massage table<br />
<br />
I climbed onto the table, burying my head into a towel. I was determined that I would not scream. I let Liz reposition my legs, then felt her gently rub a warm liquid over the back of my shin. It wasn&#39;t painfully hot, mildly pleasant actually. &#39;Rip&#39; ughhh! I yelled into the towel. The process was repeated multiple times. She worked up one leg to my bum then repeated the process on the other. <br />
<br />
Eventually she told me to roll over and started on the front. Again she worked her way up, one leg at a time. Going as far up as my panties let her. When she had finished both legs she asked &quot;What  would you like, Brazilion? Bikini?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a regular bikini thanks&quot; Did I just say that? Was this really happening or was I in an extended dream?<br />
<br />
I felt Liz tug my panties down. I didn&#39;t want to look as she waxed around my groin. &quot;How&#39;s that&quot; she eventually asked. I took a peek. It looked very similar to what Sarah had down there. Just a neat little patch of pubic hair.<br />
<br />
I nodded &quot;That&#39;s good&quot; She pulled my panties back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like your arms done?&quot; I thought of Sarah&#39;s arms. They had a fuzz of hair on them similar to what I currently had. I thought my arms looked fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;What about your under arms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they would need doing&quot; I knew my underarm hair was quite lush.<br />
<br />
Liz worked on them. The skin there must have been a bit more sensitive as I found myself unable to muffle girlish screams on several occasions. Eventually she was done. She then massaged a  cream in all the spots she had waxed which was very soothing. Once finished she said. &quot;Put the gown back on and I&#39;ll take you back to Amy&quot;<br />
<br />
Once I was sitting in Amy&#39;s barbershop chair she told me &quot;I was thinking an Emily Blunt style would suit you. What do you think?&quot;<br />
I had heard of Emily Blunt but had no idea what she looked like. &quot;That sounds good&quot; was all I could say.<br />
<br />
I was able to watch in the mirror as Amy transformed me further. She somehow cut my hair so that it framed my face. I thought my new hairstyle suited Rhonda&#39;s face and for the first time realized that I was actually pretty good looking.<br />
 <br />
Once my hair was finished Amy handed me over to Angie. She looked at my fingernails and said that I had looked after them very well and there was not much she needed to do. Did I want them polished? <br />
<br />
I looked at the clock It was nearly 10 sarah would be here soon &quot;No thanks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could shape your eyebrows instead&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; <br />
<br />
She was still working on my eyebrows when Sarah returned &quot;Looking good Rhonda&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be 5 minutes&quot; said Angie.<br />
<br />
Sarah went over and chatted to Amy while Angie finished. Angie gave me a mirror to look at myself. Whatever she had done made my eyes look bigger and brighter. &quot;If your not in a hurry I could make you up&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah had obviously heard and said &quot;No hurry&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie was much quicker at applying makeup than Sarah and within 10 minutes said &quot;Done, what do you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
I looked a completely different woman to the girl who had walked in 2 hours ago.  All I could say to Angie was &quot;Thank-you. You have done wonders&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie said &quot;Keep this lipstick. It suits you really well&quot; handing me the lipstick tube she had been using.<br />
<br />
I returned to the cubicle got dressed and admired myself in the mirror. If I was still Zach I&#39;d pursue the girl who was looking back at me. I returned to the front of the salon with a new found confidence. Amy was there and handed me a stack of notes. &quot;For the hair&quot;<br />
I handed back $50 &quot;A tip for Angie&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah was waiting for me &quot;Come on girlfriend. Let&#39;s go shopping&quot;<br />
...............<br />
<br />
&quot;1st stop is the Zimmers Boutique&quot; said Sarah once we were back in the car. &quot;They have a great range of dresses I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find something that is perfect for you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm. Sarah, remember it&#39;s Rod in here or Zach or whoever I am. I&#39;m not really looking for a dress to wear to a wedding&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just want you to experience what being a girl is like. And dress shopping is one of my favorite things to do&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve already had some experiences this morning that I never would have imagined a couple of weeks ago&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get a brazilion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I did get a bikini wax and my armpits done, It hurt&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You poor little girl. I&#39;ll make it up to you by letting you play with these tonight&quot; indicating the D cup breasts she was currently in possession of.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did the bikini shopping go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A new Red bikini is in that bag in the back. You will like it&quot;<br />
<br />
We arrived at Zimmers. Sarah took me to the &#39;Racewear&#39; section and started leafing through the racks. &quot;What do you think of this&quot; She held up a white dress with a black floral pattern on it &quot;You would call it a midi dress&quot; Try this on while I see what else I can find&quot;<br />
<br />
I took the dress into the change room and put it on. It came down to my knees. The silky material it was made from swished against my smooth legs. I thought it looked nice. I came out of the change room and found Sarah much where I had left her. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around&quot; I did so. &quot;It&#39;s nice but we could do better. Try this blue dress&quot; she handed me a blue dress. &quot;I&#39;m going to try on this one&quot; She held a dark purple sleeveless dress.<br />
<br />
This time we went to the change rooms together. I thought the blue dress looked fantastic. It had like a lace outer layer over a silk inner layer. The shoulders were fully lace.  I swung around in front of the mirror. The skirt part flared out as I did so. <br />
<br />
We exited our change rooms simultaneously.  Sarah looked spectacular in her dress and she liked what I was wearing. &quot;I want to buy this&quot; I said, twirling in front of Sarah &quot;And I want to buy that dress for you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are very nice.  And on special. 30% off&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I just earned $300 for nothing, so this is my shout&quot; We returned to the change rooms and took the dresses off. With the discount I was able to purchase both dresses for $148.  The sales assistant took my cash and bagged our purchases. As we walked out of the shop Sarah said &quot;We will have to find some shoes to match these dresses and I need some new bra&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Next stop was &#39;Sonia&#39;s Shoes&quot; There we found some open toed shoes with 3 inch heels that Sarah thought would go well with the blue dress. I baulked at the price of $120. Sara insisted that she would get value out of a purchase even if Rhonda did not. Our feet were the same size. <br />
<br />
After that we visited &#39;BrasNthings&#39; a lingerie shop. Sarah had a staff member professionally measure her bra size and left me to browse. I had once visited the store with Amanda but had been too self conscious to look at any of the stock. Now I was able to look at all the different styles of panties and bras, camisoles and sleepwear. I was amazed at the variety. A lot of the items took my fancy. I was trying to figure out why I was attracted,  was it because I liked seeing females in lingerie or was it because the items would show off my body to it&#39;s best advantage. I really didn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
Eventually Sarah and the shop assistant emerged from the changeroom. Sarah collected a variety of bra&#39;s of different colors and styles and paid for them. She asked me &quot;What did you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rhonda, You are a hot woman and at some stage Trevor is going to take you out for dinner. You will need an outfit and that does not just include a dress. We are not leaving until you have at least purchased the essentials. You have been browsing, surely something has taken your fancy&quot; With that she dragged me back around the shop. I ended up buying two bra and panty sets, a camisole and two chemises.<br />
<br />
Once I had paid for my purchases Sarah said &quot;Lets go home. Biddy will be after a walk and we need to sort out what we are wearing to the party. I&#39;m also keen to see how Rod feels about my new breasts&quot; <br />
<br />
I had no objection to that, and was aware that my nipples were enlarged as we carried our purchases back to the car.<br />
<br />
On the way home we called into the supermarket and picked up both the food and  alcohol requirements for the Sunday BBQ.</p>
