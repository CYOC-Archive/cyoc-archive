<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before I start, I&#39;d like to write a quick note.  The last chapter was written by me, although CYOC logged me out without me realizing.  This is why it looks like it was written by an anon.  Anyway, I&#39;m going to stop writing Leopold&#39;s story for a bit due to a lack of ideas for it.  He&#39;s just learning his powers.  I personally am not very good at writing &quot;training&quot; chapters.  For chapters with both Leopold&#39;s and Rowan&#39;s stories, they will be in the format the last two chapters were in.  Also, the pronoun &#39;You&#39; will only refer to you, Gannoth.  Finally, in Leopold&#39;s story, the way things will be described will be from an outsider&#39;s point of view, AKA 3rd person.  Rowan will be referred to by less flattering language, while Leopold will be treated by the narrator as a hero.  Meanwhile, Rowan&#39;s story (and by extension your own) will be/is in the 2nd person.  The reader is Gannoth.  Everything should be described from his/your point of view.  With that out of the way, here&#39;s the next chapter in Tales of the Arcane!<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot;  You started in a begging tone.  &quot;Are you sure you can&#39;t come with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot;  Rowan answered sternly.  You bowed your head in sadness.  You wished that Rowan could come with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;  You whimpered sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled, trying to cheer you up.  His smile was one of the things that made you happiest.  His perfectly white teeth glimmered, while his demonically sharp canine teeth stood out prominently from the rest.  &quot;This was your personal goal.  I don&#39;t want to take that away from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I need you?  What if something happens?&quot;  You asked, still begging for Rowan to come along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  Without me, you will gain many things.&quot;  Rowan started, returning to his stern, commanding tone.  &quot;You will learn survival tactics, gain more magical power, and learn to fend for yourself.  Plus, I haven&#39;t told you this yet, but we have a deep connection.  Our souls are intertwined.  If you get into any trouble, which is a possibility, I will know immediately, and come to help you.  You are strong Gannoth.  Prove this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master.&quot;  You said, accepting that you&#39;d be doing this journey alone.  &quot;I&#39;ll miss you Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll miss you too Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled, hugging your draconic body.  &quot;Don&#39;t forget about our telepathic bond.  No matter the distance, we can still talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master.  Next time you see me, I&#39;ll be the King of Dragons!&quot;  You replied, gaining the courage to journey through the world alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.  Good luck Gannoth.  I know the Archdemon will not let anything happen to you.&quot;  Rowan smiled, sending you off.  &quot;He likes you too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Master.&quot;  You smiled, heading out of the castle.  You were about to embark on quite a journey.  One that, if successful, would have you ruling over the dragons of the world.  Once you were out of the castle, you grew your form to that of a fully grown dragon.  One that was about 50 feet tall.  Aside from size though, nothing was different (aesthetically or physically.)  With a quick, yet powerful flap of the wings, you were airborne, speeding into the mountains of Kelper.  You read that dragons tended to live in large communities in mountain ranges.  Another book stated that the Dragons originated from the Kelper Mountains.  You figured that it would be a good place to start looking.  Sure enough, after about one hour, you found a large collection of dragons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt!&quot;  One dragon yelled.  He was a bit smaller than you, and seemed a bit frightened.  For good reason too.  Royal Irontails were revered in the dragon world for their ferocity, power, and ruthlessness.  You could tell from your extensive dragon research that he was a Terraclaw dragon, a dragon species known for how it shapes the land around it.  &quot;State your name new dragon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Gannoth Tyrell.&quot;  You responded proudly.  &quot;Royal Irontail and proud familiar to Lord Rowan Tyrell, the most powerful sorcerer to live!&quot;  The other dragon seemed to start worrying less.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dragon familiar?&quot;  He asked, snorting a bit of smoke from his nostrils.  &quot;And I was worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be.&quot;  You smiled.  The other dragon&#39;s fear started to come back.  &quot;You have no idea what I&#39;m capable of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think that?&quot;  The dragon asked, trying to mask his obvious fear.  He knew deep down that you were a threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know of Kitria?  The kingdom south of here?&quot;  You asked, laughing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;  The dragon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s gone now.&quot;  You answered, smiling an evil grin.  &quot;My master and I destroyed it yesterday.  We made it explode in many different ways.  Now, there&#39;s nothing but a crater where that whole kingdom was.  Need anymore proof of my superiority?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Sir.&quot;  The dragon responded terrified, shaking his head no.  &quot;Please forgive my rudeness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are forgiven for now.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;When I take over and rule the dragons, I&#39;ll remember you.&quot;  You continued your evil laughter as you entered the community of dragons.  You saw hundreds of different dragons, all living together in what seemed like a community.  There were big dragons, small dragons, dragons that specialized in more physical activities, and some that specialized in more magical ones.  Young dragons were playing with other young dragons.  Dragons were socializing, talking with one another.  There were many different shapes, sizes, and colors of dragons.  Eventually, a young dragon saw you, and started talking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mister!&quot;  The young girl shouted excitedly.  &quot;Are you new here?  I don&#39;t recognize you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.  My name is Gannoth.  I&#39;m a Royal Irontail.&quot;  You responded, smiling a friendly smile.  You had no intention of obliterating any fellow dragons.  You just wanted to overthrow their leader and become it yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Starfire!&quot;  She answered with a big smile.  &quot;I&#39;m a Bluefire Dragon!&quot;  Sure enough, she was.  Bluefire Dragons were known for their mastery over the element of fire, showing enough expertise to change the color of it.  The first one discovered breathed a plume of blue fire, giving it the name Bluefire.  She was a small, child dragon, maybe 7 feet long.  &quot;I&#39;ve never met a Royal Irontail!  I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re really strong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true.&quot;  You chuckled slightly.  &quot;I am quite a strong dragon, Starfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I grow up, I want to be a big, strong dragon!&quot;  Starfire smiled with a childlike innocence you wished you could experience again.  She didn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t understand the atrocities you&#39;ve committed.  &quot;Can I see how strong you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot;  You answered, toying with her excitement.  &quot;If you insist...&quot;  You laughed as you magically created a huge ball of blazing, orange fire, and shot it into the sky.  It exploded in a rainbow of magnificent colors.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  That was amazing Gannoth!&quot;  She said awestruck.  &quot;Let&#39;s be friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m a bit too old for that.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;But I think I can let it slide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THANK YOU!!&quot;  She smiled, flying away to a small group of dragons that seemed around her age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth?&quot;  You heard Rowan&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master?&quot;  You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that big explosion in the sky?&quot;  He asked.  &quot;I know it was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a little girl dragon who wanted to see my magic.  That&#39;s all.&quot;  You answered with a slight laugh.  &quot;Still making my way to the leader of this community of dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Rowan responded.  &quot;Just wanted to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, bye Master.  Need to overthrow dragon kings now...&quot;  You said, leaving the telepathic chat.  After much searching, you eventually found the leader of the dragon community.  As you approached him, you noticed that he was already prepared to fight.  &quot;Hello.  My name is Gannoth Tyrell.&quot;  You introduced yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who you are, monster.&quot;  The dragon hissed.  He was about the same size as you.  &quot;You are the familiar of that damned Rowan Tyrell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why so angry?&quot;  You asked, smiling an evil grin.  &quot;Is that any way to treat your future king?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you say anything of the sort!&quot;  The dragon yelled, looking like he was ready to attack.  &quot;Dragons do not bow down to masters.  We are a proud race!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, you will.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;I&#39;ll make a deal with you.  You tell me the location of other dragon towns like this, and you can be a member of my court when I rule over the dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I refuse?&quot;  He responded aggressively.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to see poor Starfire dead, would you?&quot;  You laughed, your slight grin becoming a full evil smile.  &quot;Along with the rest of this community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t.&quot;  The dragon sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t bluff.&quot;  You responded.  &quot;Now.  Where are the rest of the dragons?&quot;<br />
<br />
