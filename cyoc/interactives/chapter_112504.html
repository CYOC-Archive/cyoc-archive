<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not knowing of events elsewhere, it was a lovely dinner at the Talbot house, but Jean politely passed on dessert, wanting to spend more time with her new fiance Nate Anderson.<br />
The happy werewolf willingly let his future mate lead him by the paw up the stairs back towards her bedroom, but once they were out of sight, the werelioness switched and grabbed him lovingly by Nate&#39;s growing and eager lupine red rocket.<br />
Nate loved his lady&#39;s touch, especially in more intimate moments like this, as he reached out and wrapped his own furry arms around her sexy waist.<br />
Jean did nothing but smiled at him as her tail teased his chest.<br />
But once they were alone in her room once more, she was all action.<br />
&quot;Okay husband, or fiance, whichever you prefer*; time to claim me as your mate properly,&quot; she growled, while climbing onto her bed and getting on all fours. &quot;Mount me and lets rut till we drop wolfie!&quot; said Jean, as she raised her tail and started seductively shaking her ass at him.<br />
Nate let out a low howl of impending pleasure as he did as requested, coming up behind her and sinking his werewolf penis deep into her wet lioness cunt.<br />
What pleasantly surprised both of them was that Nate completely filled Jean in one stroke, including pushing his top knot well into her vaginal tunnel.<br />
&quot;Oh wolfie...&quot; crooned Jean, even as she and Nate started rutting to the point that he was afraid the bed frame was about to break and crash to the floor.<br />
Thankfully it never did, but the mattress&#39; box springs squeaked and the bed frame did creak a bit.<br />
Yet the only noises that mattered to the couple were the sound of his thighs slapping against her furry butt cheeks even as the unique squishing sound of cock in pussy was drowned out by growls and howls of the two experiencing multiple orgasms together.<br />
<br />
DOWNSTAIRS...<br />
Leon Talbot helped his wife Regina clear the dinner table and clean up, but there was not much conversation to be had with the noises coming from upstairs.<br />
&quot;She really loves him,&quot; observed Jean&#39;s father.<br />
&quot;And he her. Do you know that he was so anxious to propose, Nate asked me if we had any onion rings available?&quot; revealed Regina, smiling at the thought of her daughter getting married.<br />
&quot;I remember when I finally came to my senses and realized that you were the one for me,&quot; said Leon, as the werelion &quot;king&quot; of Moon Lake put his furry arms around his &quot;queen&quot;. &quot;My stomach was full of butterflies and in hindsight, I&#39;m amazed I managed to get the words out without stuttering like a fool.&quot;<br />
&quot;I did not marry a fool,&quot; replied Regina, turning around to face her husband. &quot;You know,&quot; she said with a smile, moving closer to press her leonine body against his, &quot;there is no reason why Jean and Nate should be the only ones to have some fun this evening...&quot; before she kissed him.<br />
Since it was after sunset, Leon was about to suggest a romantic romp in the woods when the front door bell rang.<br />
<br />
Peeping through the spy hole in the door first, Leon Talbot went ahead and answered it since it was Sheriff Douglas Cooper on his front porch. Cooper was currently in human form and wearing his official uniform. If it had been someone Leon did not know to be a fellow were, he would have immediately shifted out of his fursona and donned the over sized bathrobe he kept on the coat rack near the door.<br />
Instead, Leon simply opened the door and said, &quot;Good evening Douglas. Has one of our neighbors complained about the noise?&quot;<br />
&quot;What noise?&quot; the Sheriff began to ask, when he heard all the sexual sounds coming from upstairs.<br />
&quot;My daughter is celebrating her were-wedding with her fiance,&quot; explained Leon.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Cooper in surprise. &quot;Congratulations. I&#39;m sure the groom is well deserving of the honor,&quot; he added with genuine compliment, &quot;but I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Leon, arching one furry eyebrow in a combination of surprise and suspicion.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no easy way to say this Leon,&quot; began the Sheriff, trying to find the words, since the two of them were somewhat friends and Cooper knew how the werelion representative of the Elders&#39; Council would react when he heard the news.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Talbot demanded to know, even as his wife started to approach, wondering what was keeping her husband from initiating their own fun.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that... Peter&#39;s been shot,&quot; said Cooper, bracing himself for what was about to happen.<br />
<b>&quot;WHAT?&quot;</b> roared the lion &quot;king&quot; in shock, so loudly that Regina took a step back in fear as Jean and Nate stopped in mid-stroke upstairs.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s being rushed to Moon Lake General right now, and I&#39;ve got my best men, including my head werewolf, on the perp&#39;s scent,&quot; announced the Sheriff.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Leon managed to ask in a somewhat calmer tone of voice as his wife collapsed on the couch and began to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Early reports say your son pulled into The Local Diner, probably for a bite to eat, when some normal jumped him and stole the 66 Mustang he was driving. All the early evidence indicates it was just a crook taking advantage of the moment to attempt stealing an antique car. Witnesses at the scene say Peter never shifted into his fursona, so the suspect probably doesn&#39;t even know weres exist, let alone Moon Lake is home to them,&quot; explained Cooper.<br />
&quot;Whatever my brothers and I restore, all our projects have a GPS driven <i>Lo-Jak</i> within them in case of emergencies like this. I can get you the info on Peter&#39;s immediately, since it is in the family,&quot; said Leon.<br />
&quot;Good. We—&quot; began Cooper, only to be interrupted by a tearful Regina.<br />
&quot;What about our son?&quot; she sobbed.<br />
&quot;As soon as you all defur and get dressed, I&#39;ll take you to the hospital myself,&quot; promised the Sheriff.<br />
&quot;Hospital? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jean Talbot wanted to know, as she started descending the stairs with Nate Anderson close behind her.<br />
Douglas Cooper wasn&#39;t surprised to see the werelioness was engaged to a werewolf, especially considering who he was romantically interested in.<br />
&quot;Your brother&#39;s been shot!&quot; cried her mother, even as a now fully human in appearance but totally nude Regina Talbot ran upstairs to get dressed.<br />
<br />
TO BE CONTINUED!<br />
