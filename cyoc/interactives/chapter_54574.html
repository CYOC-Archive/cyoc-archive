<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In 1675. <br />
<br />
The bobcat hated the wolves that went on two legs, hated them, hate them, hated them! <br />
Wolves had never been in this part of the world until those two legged wolves arrived and <br />
began to muscle out other top predators. The bobcat loathed their presence, but there was <br />
nothing to be done about them... Some babcats had tried, and even without the cheating <br />
of the arrows from humans, these two legged beasts proved their superior. Yes, the <br />
bobcats hated them so dearly! <br />
<br />
The bobcats hadn't exactly been able to get a hold of Gold Deer all that often before, but <br />
now it had become absolutely impossible! <br />
<br />
The bobcat hated them all, two legged freaks of nature. The bobcats had many enemies, <br />
coyotes, wolves, also saw them as 'business rivals' that needed to be eliminated. <br />
<br />
Hunting past midnight, which in of itself was unnatural, the beast smelled some small <br />
humans, and a few other scents he didn't know, but didn't care. <br />
<br />
He found them, standing clear in view, no adults in sight or smell, standing up straight <br />
ready to be knocked over under a full moon: these creatures were begging to die! He saw <br />
and smelled the bird, snake, and cat they were holding. <br />
<br />
But unlike the house pet one of them was holding, the Bobcat's body was almost <br />
completely solid muscle! <br />
<br />
He came slowly to them against the wind. One of the girls finally noticed his glowing eyes <br />
and saw them, the one with the cat, and smiled and waved making friendly noises. He <br />
guessed she thought he was no different from the  round in the belly feline loafer in her <br />
arms.  Too bad for her. <br />
<br />
He leapt, snarling, fanged bared, the girl fell backwards on her own... only now did he <br />
notice she was missing an eye... It was like in the split second before he leapt she -knew- <br />
what was going to happen, but that was impossible! <br />
<br />
Oh well, instead he landed on the blond girl with the snake around one arm, the snake <br />
had to be weak and cowardly or it wouldn't be around a human. He landed hard against <br />
the human child and she fell back the wind knocked out of her. The bobcat was going to <br />
enjoy this.  Then like lightning he felt something wrap around his neck. He tried to claw at <br />
it but his forelegs weren't built for such a feat and drew blood but couldn't get a good <br />
swipe. That was when the bird from before began pecking at his face! What was this?! This <br />
wasn't natural! Therefore it couldn't be happening! <br />
<br />
He rolled off the girl, his lungs screaming for air, he felt bones beginning to crack, he had <br />
to breath! He had to breath! He blacked out. <br />
<br />
Gita got up scared looking at the unconscious wild cat as Daisy slithered off him and back <br />
to her, claw marks on her long body. Solome flew back to Grissele. <br />
<br />
At once Gita used her magic in a way she had only once before and actually -healed-. <br />
Scales and muscles reconnected themselves, and Gita felt the backwash at the alien use of <br />
her magic and struck her dizzy, and she knew, she knew! A look of recognition filled her <br />
eyes as she embraced the serpent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your real name... it's Lilith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress... that is my true name...&quot; And Gita felt everything Lilith was, her embracing, <br />
the taste in the air, the coldness in the air being the same coldness within, the discomfort <br />
of being in a skin one size too small when shedding... Gita felt it all. <br />
<br />
Gita saw the bobcat with it's bruised and damaged neck. One thought crossed Master and <br />
Familiar's minds. <br />
<br />
Lilith's eyes glowed, and Gita used her newfound power with perfect precisions. The <br />
bobcat felt himself feeling stronger, fresher, injuries healing, at the same time, like his <br />
muscles were getting punier... that didn't matter so much, cause soon he felt he was <br />
someplace warm and wet that kept pushing him further along... like returning to mommy's <br />
womb. <br />
<br />
Grissele petted Solome while Goldwyn and Princess looked on with straight satisfied faces <br />
as the bobcat cub was swallowed whole, and was soon nothing more than a bulge in <br />
Lilith's body. <br />
<br />
Both Princess and Goldwyn felt no pity, no empathy, only a grim satisfaction as the animal <br />
was punished for hurting her sister and her sister's familiar. The two looked at each other, <br />
&quot;Do you want to look away?&quot; Goldwyn asked, &quot;He is a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are NOT the same! He's a wild animal. I am a Felis, he's a Lynx, I am better than him!&quot; <br />
<br />
Goldwyn thought of all the adults who thought they knew better, of all the adults who <br />
would never take the direct solution, who would never do something unless it was within <br />
the rules, always molding children of the next generation into clones of them... 'I'm better <br />
than them too!' <br />
<br />
And that was when it clicked. &quot;Princess! Your one true real name! It's Herodias!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes Mistress It is! I am Herodias! I am so glade you finally know! And I am so glade <br />
that your sisters are now connected to their familiars! They can help you for a while...&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldwyn wondered what she meant, but she felt something different about Herodias <br />
somehow, something that seemed slightly off. <br />
<br />
&quot;I found a nice male tabby around Glendale owned by one of the priests named Barabbas. <br />
Sorry I did not inform you of him my Mistress...  But I do believe I am now carrying his <br />
kittens... &quot;  Herodias was also glade the connection was now made, Herodias for a cat was <br />
now reaching middle age, but now connected to her Master her lifespan and thus her <br />
service to her Master would extend so she might continue to serve them. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn hugged her, but carefully, &quot;Oh that's wonderful news Herodias! That's wonderful!&quot; <br />
<br />
At the same time, Golwyn had a want, no a need! She needed to test her new combined <br />
link with Herodias. She looked at Gita and hew she wanted to test her newfound focus and <br />
precision with Lilith. Right now! <br />
<br />
Sadly being past one in the morning, the girls would have absolutely no luck in hunting <br />
down a person to be awake at this hour to test their magic on. Of course for Goldwyn and <br />
Gita, that just meant tomorrow morning would be entertaining indeed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Faries!&quot; Gita declared.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dolls!&quot; Goldwyn returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fairy Dolls?&quot; Griselle offered as a compromise. <br />
<br />
Her two older sisters looked at each other and said as one, &quot;Naw.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Winter of 1675 <br />
<br />
Now letting her hair begin to grow out, and now dyed blond instead of her natural black, <br />
Marie Cruz shuddered at what she heard on the other side of the arches that divided the <br />
path she was on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Draco Fire? What kind of silly name is THAT for a dragon? Draco means 'dragon' and 'fire' <br />
how unimaginative can you get-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie felt sick inside as she thought, 'You don't know him.'<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't have a choice in the name was given.&quot; Came a low voice, almost like a grunt. <br />
<br />
Two other choir boys were talking to the lad whose visible flesh was covered in bandages, <br />
complete with a small turban on top of his head and a cloth mask over his mouth. Of <br />
course he wore much the same outfit as the lads speaking at him. <br />
<br />
Marie knew the story, 'Dragons are normally known for having over the top names that get <br />
more over the top as they get older...' To another dragon, Draco's name would translate as <br />
'Less Than Nothing' for it's simplicity and unremarkability.  'Draco was handed off to the <br />
church as a throw away peace offering when he was still in the egg...' <br />
<br />
Marie's basic desire to climb over the stone barrier (it was only six feet tall, easy for her) <br />
and tells these boys to leave him alone... But if she did that, there was a good chance they <br />
might still recognize 'Maurice.' <br />
<br />
So Marie bit her lip and fought down the fowl tasting bile as she stood there as Draco took <br />
the taunting without so much as a twitch and continued on his way. <br />
<br />
'Draco I'm sorry...' <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Glass Marie's relatively large audience of Lawrence, Betty, Samantha, Maddex and his <br />
daughters, and Lilly and Casandra listened intently, none of them the least bit tired, <br />
sleepy, or hungry. Police Chief Gillie was likely to explain to the pack's various employers <br />
and employees that the Big Bad Pack was involved in a police operation to save the world <br />
and would with proper prodding grant them the leave they needed all to recover and to <br />
look after their loved ones until that time. <br />
<br />
 All of her audience listening with attentive ears on the origin of the curse of Geldnale <br />
'Transform or Dare.'  <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Tabitha hoped Wanda was alright. Her roommate hadn't come home from duty that night, <br />
or the night before. Of course Wanda was with the police, so that made her worry all the <br />
more. Of course she called the police station, but first they told it was 'police business' <br />
and then that 'she was recovering from severe injuries received in the line of duty.' <br />
<br />
Tabitha of course was now double worried, and on TOP of that, she had been turned into <br />
an insane Rihno-Woman with Six Breasts by the out of control Game of Glendale <br />
apparently being very real (she'd have to apologize to Wanda about that) and being <br />
returned to a normal human being when 'Kurse' was apparently destroyed. <br />
<br />
Tabitha was NOT sorry to no longer be a giant gray skinned creature with all the sanity of <br />
a bag of jellybeans. And she was all the more worried about Wanda. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I can't exactly lie and say I'm her sister... and trying to lie about being her <br />
dewring (pronounced dew-ring, word for female/female union) would be even more <br />
obvious a lie, we're not even the same species, and I'm not that good an actress. Okay, I <br />
like Wanda, but I don't swing that way, I guess in a way it's MORE comfortable to be <br />
around her since no one gives the couple jokes since we're different species... I'm not a <br />
furry and she wouldn't turn me on anyway. I was into fantasy because it offers an escape, <br />
Wanda's into fantasy hoping one tiny bit of it will turn out to be real... I guess she wins out <br />
on this one... &quot;  <br />
<br />
Of course in a reality where lion people and wolf people were real, the furry fandom <br />
offered much less of an escape for human beings seeking an ideal, and thus was <br />
considerably smaller, but ironically the ones who remained were more accepted. <br />
<br />
In the old timeline, Wade had been rather impulsive, not really thinking how the change in <br />
species would work out, let alone gender, and just how permanent it would all be. <br />
<br />
Tabitha 'Tabby' (yes she was aware of the joke) walked around the apartment, it was an <br />
odd mix and match since the two of them needed different sized items of most of <br />
everything. On the other hand this created an easily balance between the two since neither <br />
really used the other's stuff without permission. Besides, Wanda was always polite and <br />
considerate with her. If she was a guy Tabby would call her a perfect gentleman.  <br />
<br />
Tabby remembered one year at high school prom where Wanda was worn a mane wig to <br />
pass as a male and be her date at the prom when Tabby was dateless due to bad luck, and <br />
their performance had been passible enough to get them to the runners-up at the 'Prom <br />
King and Queen' competition. Tabby was VERY glade that one had never become public <br />
knowledge.  <br />
<br />
Wanda looked around the two person apartment again, &quot;This place feels so empty without <br />
her... Okay, that's it, I'm going down to the station tomorrow morning and demanding they <br />
tell me where the person who pays half my rent is bedded up!&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when the phone rang. Tabby calmed herself out of her melodrama and picked it <br />
up. <br />
<br />
On the other end a woman introduced herself as one of Wanda's friends whose name was <br />
familiar. Tabby explained Wanda was out, and the woman asked some simple questions of <br />
where she was. Tabby answered she had no idea and after being told about trying to get in <br />
contact with one of Wanda's pridemates they didn't know by name, Tabby suggested they <br />
send the letter to the police station, since the pride there would pick it up and be able to <br />
give to Wanda who'd be able to hand it over to the pride member the woman was looking <br />
for her. The two said polite goodbyes and hung up, and Tabby went to bed wondering <br />
when she'd get to interact with her best friend again. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... &quot; Father Mike said, &quot;If we are going to go with your method, in order to retain <br />
it's potency we're going to need more than we can produce with the stocks of materials we <br />
have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Paul signed, 'Already. On. Order. Be. Here. By Time. We Are Done. With. What. We. <br />
Have.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you brother...&quot; Father Mike breathed out. Serenity also hugged the ape. Judas <br />
purred and rubbed against his big orange fur. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The now four grinning busty fountain heads sat now in the quiet of the night. Kira <br />
thought to the others, 'Well, that was fun. And while us all being the same really does give <br />
me a nice sense of wholeness togetherness and all the other things I sure our triplets feel, <br />
I think with Michelle gone the spell is kinda broken and I'm gonna head back to the entry <br />
way... hey Nessie.' <br />
<br />
'Yes?'<br />
<br />
'As long as you're being a girl, I think I'll try at being a guy for a bit.' Kira thought. <br />
<br />
'Okay Kira, as you wish.' Nessie thought, none of the statues had bothered to ask Kira how <br />
she got a name like that considering she had been stone for 200 years and they weren't <br />
sure Japanese were even part of America yet.'<br />
<br />
'Thanks for understanding guys.'<br />
<br />
Helen thought, 'If we tried to force you to stay in a form you didn't like, we'd be no <br />
different from the bastards who left us not able to even goodbye to our families...'<br />
<br />
 Kira disconnected from the water system, the pipes vanishing from her rear and those <br />
inside her becoming flesh and blood for the moment. The very dark brown female's <br />
breasts shrank down as she assumed what was more or less her default form as her <br />
features became more unique from that of her fellow art. In the empty front lawn she gave <br />
her fellow souled-art a salute and calmly walked into the entry way though the mansion's <br />
double doors. <br />
<br />
'Looks kinda empty without me... well, that's about to be fixed.'<br />
<br />
Assuming a more sitting pose than before, Kira's body became bronze as she stepped into <br />
position. Her body grew and grew, becoming as tall as a leoman and beyond as her chest <br />
flattened out, her shoulders became broader and her hips thinner her tail keeping it's low <br />
angle. Then of course her reproductive organs inverted on themselves and went into a <br />
protective sheath.  Her, his body completely bronze he dominated the room becoming tall <br />
enough that he'd bump the double floor ceiling if he stood up. The wires and the controls <br />
for the gate and intercom appeared on a hatch at his backside.  He was then wired into <br />
the city's home's and thus the city's power grid. <br />
<br />
'Heh, look at me mommy I'm Zeus!' Kira thought, of course he didn't really bear any actual <br />
resemblance to the greek god, but the pose was similar somewhat to one of Zeus' many <br />
statues. <br />
<br />
Sunny and Luna walked into the entryway, looking exhasted, &quot;And I thought WE ate a lot.&quot; <br />
Luna lamented. <br />
<br />
&quot;We eat normal, they eat a lot.&quot; Sunny retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is relative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew the hurt Pride are sleeping the medical wing by default, but what about everyone <br />
else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna thought about it as they sat down in front of the massive bronze lupman statue <br />
without so much as a glance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mother Glen doesn't have a day job. So she can stay freely. But the others I'm sure <br />
are going to have to call in to tell their bosses that they won't be coming in tomorrow, not <br />
all the Pride are in the police you know. Though given what's happened to the <br />
quadruplets, I doubt anyone is going to complain about them missing a few days of <br />
school. And Mary, you know how bright she is? She's not as smart as Bart and Jenny, but <br />
still, that girl could be high school and fit right in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunny shook her head, &quot;I seriously doubt she'd 'fit right in.' Her ninth birthday is next <br />
month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna tilted her head, &quot;You know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunny shrugged, &quot;I like to take notes about people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna nodded, &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But seriously, where are they going to stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna went through it in her head, &quot;The cubs will likely go into the pups bedroom for a <br />
while. The rest can rest in some of the guest rooms I'm guessing... speaking of which, I'm <br />
too tired to go our bedroom tonight, do you think anyone will complain too much if we <br />
just conk out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Sunny said and then yawned, &quot;That seems to be what the majority of <br />
the Pack is doing anyway! Two more or two less aren't going to make a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna shrugged at that. <br />
<br />
Kira made a modification to his body inspired from species of marsupials and the omegas. <br />
<br />
Sunny turned her head and looked at the statue, if she couldn't have lupman perfection in <br />
Alpha-Jensen she could at least look at the ideal version. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sunny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a look at the statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna did as she was asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't it look odd to you? The statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it... maybe a little... but it's had the double pistols since Alpha-<br />
Kaylee had it commissioned and built.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally I think it's her way of balancing out the bouncy ladies outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed... But I'm serious, doesn't it seem to be missing something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both lady lupmans stood up, slowly made their way to the giant statue.<br />
<br />
Sunny suggested, &quot;Are you thinking what I'm thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna cringed, &quot;Alpha Kaylee would kill us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't kill us for making advances at Alpha Jensen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but she came very close to mauling us! We were just lucky that we ran faster than her <br />
until she calmed down! And I need I remind you that was YOUR idea too! I went along just <br />
so you wouldn't get your head bitten off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you cared Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always have Sunny. You're my best friend. What did you expect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, they wouldn't fit us anyway, let's just touch'em for a bit so we can say we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh all right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna reached out and touched one of the unsheathed pieces of bronze. Sunny did the <br />
same with less hesitation and worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;There.&quot; Luna said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...&quot; Sunny said, &quot;I we might be able to fit after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Sunny! This is going too far!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh lighten up Luna, I know you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But just LOOK AT IT! Isn't something seriously wrong? You can't tell me you don't feel it <br />
too! Tell what what feels wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna did look, and it clicked her mind like a flood gate, &quot;We.... WE'RE WHAT'S MISSING!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two lady lupman at once began to position themselves on the metal shafts, as they <br />
began to grow to sizes that would make even a leoman tremble and should have caused <br />
their spines to break in two from the added weight. However their complex almost artistic <br />
fur patterns quickly became shinny and darkened to a bronze as they grew to be as <br />
gigantic as the statue and mounted themselves. <br />
<br />
Bliss washed through both of them as they mirrored each other, placing one leg on the <br />
inside of the statue's thighs and putting a hand on the opposite end of the statue' neck <br />
and turned a loving smile at him the rest of their bodies proudly on display foreword to <br />
anyone who saw them. Wiring went through their bodies as they turned to otherwise <br />
bronze as up their throats were a speaker filled their throats hidden from view in the dark <br />
recesses of their mouthes. <br />
<br />
They were connected to the estate's power grid, and thus the city's power grid, and thus <br />
they were connected to Glendale herself. Herself? Yes, herself. <br />
<br />
All was silent in the entry way of the three giant lupman statues.<br />
<br />
Pleasure continued to flow through the two 'new' statues.<br />
<br />
'You're welcome ladies.'<br />
<br />
'WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?' Luna wondered in her mind. <br />
<br />
'Don't worry,' Said the male voice that echoed in their thoughts, or were they echoing in <br />
his thoughts? 'Being connected to the power grid really does give a great sense of <br />
interconnection to Glendale herself, yeah I'm pretty sure Glendale is a lady, blame it on <br />
sailors calling their ships 'she' all the time.'<br />
<br />
Luna thought as Sunny was still humming to herself, 'What is this... you.. you're the <br />
statue...' <br />
<br />
'We're the statue you mean.' Thought the male voice, 'The name's Kira, I'm pretty sure that <br />
can be a guy's name. Don't ask. If you chose to leave the perception camouflage you'll <br />
mostly remember just an odd dream.'<br />
<br />
'Perception what now?' Luna asked.<br />
<br />
Kira then went a calm explanation to the nature of his abilities, exempting certain details <br />
unless asked, and introduced the others. <br />
<br />
'You're all alive?!' Sunny thought in amazement.<br />
<br />
Nessie explained, 'Alive as anything is... only the spiritually aware really seem to <br />
remember their time with us in detail...'<br />
<br />
'So why us?' Luna asked.<br />
<br />
'You were close by, the things you mentioned got my interest, so I invited your <br />
subconscious, you accepted subconsciously, and the rest followed... Besides.... Alpha <br />
Jensen is a dunce for not noticing two lovelies like you.'<br />
<br />
Sunny blushed in her mind, 'You're not just saying that?'<br />
<br />
'Souled artwork's honor I mean it. And you two have no direct family outside of the pack. <br />
No mates. No pups. Your only real friends are each other. And you got a taste of the <br />
lifestyle I heard from the battle on Big Bad Island. So I thought I'd show it to you civilized <br />
like opposed to the jackass hacks who call themselves artists who kidnap, enslave and sell <br />
people.'<br />
<br />
'So... no one will notice while we're gone... no matter how long?' Luna asked thinking <br />
objectively.<br />
<br />
'So far. We haven't tested it long term really on what would happen if you step back out of <br />
our world and back into theirs after you stay like this for say years.'<br />
<br />
'Years?'<br />
<br />
'We have eternity to watch through since we can renew ourselves if we ever begin to wear <br />
down from the elements if we chose to.'<br />
<br />
Luna asked, 'How can you live like this?'<br />
<br />
'The sense of peace. The sense of detachment and reason that comes from being an <br />
outside observer. Being the ultimate eternal witness. Knowing you won't outlive your <br />
closest buddies. I thought of making myself a relief at a theater so I could see movies for <br />
free until my packmates pointed out that would be stealing. This lifestyle comes with it's <br />
costs, oh yeah it does, but it has a few decent trade ins too.'<br />
<br />
'We have responsibilities.' Luna said. <br />
<br />
'And this is ours. What WOULD be cheating if we were just art when there was work to be <br />
done and weren't art when there was just play to be done. Connected like this I can feel <br />
both your emotions, I can tell Sunny you find this entire thing exciting and interesting and <br />
maybe that big break you wanted... and yeah, I can make myself appear like Alpha-Jensen <br />
if you like, though I think you'd have to make yourself look like Alpha-Kaylee so she <br />
wouldn't get mad.' <br />
<br />
'Make ourselves?' Sunny asked, 'You mean we can alter ourselves now too?'<br />
<br />
'The longer your connected, the longer I think the magic of ours rubs off on you. Or we <br />
think so, we haven't worked out all the details yet.' Kira admitted.<br />
<br />
'Luna!' Sunny declared. <br />
<br />
'Yes?'<br />
<br />
Sunny said almost sultry. 'I can tell you find this kinda enticing too...'<br />
<br />
'Maybe, but I'd rather not make this kind of decision until the pack WASN'T low on work <br />
hands to help things along until we're all healed.'<br />
<br />
'Can we come back here after we leave?' Sunny asked.<br />
<br />
'I don't see why not.' Kira admitted, 'And I can wait ten thousand years for you lovely <br />
ladies, since I don't have any mates or sister-wives technically, I'll even keep this form <br />
until you decide one way or another... but... can you please at least try it out for the night? <br />
You were too tired to go back to your rooms anyway, consider it a trial run.'<br />
<br />
Luna thought about it, 'Okay.'<br />
<br />
Sunny thought, 'Luna! Look inside my mind! I have a great idea! This is going to be great!'<br />
<br />
A minute later, the two female bronze statues turned to gold (Sunny) and silver (Luna) and <br />
a sun outline formed out of the back of the gold one, and a crescent moon outline from <br />
the silver statue. Their bellies grew slightly larger as if they were in the first few months of <br />
pregnancy then opened up revealing a clock face on each other. The clock face on the gold <br />
one not only showed the time and the relative position of the sun, but had a slower hand <br />
to show solar eclipses. The giant clock-face in the belly of the silver one also showed the <br />
time and date, along with the pattern of lunar eclipses. Both grew long hair that came over <br />
their shoulders almost covering their breasts but not quite (which remained the same <br />
size). <br />
<br />
'You're a regular Athena and Aphrodite!'<br />
<br />
'Which of us is which?' Luna asked mentally smiling getting in the spirit of things.<br />
<br />
'I'll leave that for you two lovelies to decide.'<br />
<br />
Both girls found they loved the sense of purposing and belonging that came from Sunny's <br />
idea, and somewhere in the back of their minds, they felt as if their spiritual presence in <br />
their current form made the estate a little more efficient... that was a good thing with so <br />
many hurt and needing attention right?<br />
<br />
Both of their minds leaned against Kira's and rested waiting till morning. <br />
<br />
Leaning on each other's shoulders, a yellow and white, and a pink and white lupman came <br />
into the entry foyer next crossing to the other side of the mansion. Both looked up at the <br />
statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kira you didn't...&quot; Kimberly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Wanna rest here and join in?&quot; Trinity found herself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, we pink she-wolves are a precious resources, like red-heads and humans. I'm <br />
not risking getting to like that lifestyle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad, it would make a full sub-pack if you did... can you make it to your room alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm tired not drunk...&quot; Kimberly remembered of the plain green Beatrice and the 'colored <br />
like herself' Pearl mentioning one time that Pearl had drunk herself nearly to the point of <br />
blood poisoning over an even neither apparently wanted to discuss but related to the <br />
dynamics of her relationship with her sister-wives or something or other, Kimberly hadn't <br />
really overheard the rest and one of the lupmen needed their bedpan changed (ugh). <br />
Beatrice seemed happy that Pearl had Zelipe. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right. See you in the morning.&quot; Trinity seemingly through will of her own, perhaps due <br />
to her time as a statue wolf herself and her connection to them like the rest of the gallery <br />
wolves, she became a equal to scale electrum lupman cub sitting between the legs of the <br />
male with a slowly turning starchart in their belly.  Words of welcoming from all three <br />
other entry way statues echoed in her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;See ya in the morning.&quot; Kimberly nodded and headed upstairs to the rooms of the other <br />
single lupmans.</p>
