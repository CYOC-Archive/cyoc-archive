<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they finished the transformation of the 17 year old boy into a filly they were contemplating whether to let the stallion out of the enclosure and into the changing area, however they decided against it.<br />
As they lead Mark out of the room he was showcased to his family which gasped at what was once their son. His brothers cheated him on as this is what he wanted, while also subconsciously knowing that he was going to be used as a breading filly.<br />
They continue to dragark on the stage at the front of the Animalia incorporated offices from the halter that they fit over his head and after a while they told his parents that they needed to be kept for a while to accommodate to his new body.<br />
In the event that you don&#39;t have somewhere to store Mark we will be more then happy to parade him around and get him a pedigree to gain the right to be bread.<br />
We, don&#39;t have a place to store him at the moment, make him comfortable and happy. asked his parents.<br />
No problem, we just need your signature to approve anything he wants to do in the facility.<br />
They signed and they were on their way after they patted on the nose their former son and former brother.<br />
Mark was a quick learned and in the time he was at the resort he learned to properly walk run and even be ridden as a horse. There was only one thing that he hadn&#39;t tried yet and his body was itching for it.<br />
He wasn&#39;t perticularly a large filly ,hower he was thin and well built at 1 and a half years old.  Mark asked if there were other transformed people as horses in this facility and one of the agents that was in charge of his training told him that all of the people in the facility are transformed humans.<br />
Are some of the people here former males that turned into fillys or mares besides me? he would ask.<br />
With the trainer answering:<br />
The fact that you were a male doesn&#39;t matter anymore, you are a filly. The staff will treat you like a filly, the people outside coming to see the exhibit will only see a filly, and the stallions definitely won&#39;t care or go easier on you due to what you had in between your legs, just what you have now.<br />
Can you introduce me to a colt or a stallion?<br />
What are you crazy, it would be like letting a 17 year old girl get nailed by the biggest guy in school, which in your case is all of them.<br />
But, I am not one to deny a wish to somebody so eager. Just don&#39;t come back to me crying after he splits you in half, deal?<br />
Yes, instructor!<br />
As she said that they marched through the barnhouse and took a sneak peak at all of the stallions in the locked padlocks waiting for her to take her pick.<br />
As she was strolling through the front of the stalls she saw a draft horse stallion that was fairly shy and that only snorted when she moved in front of him.<br />
I want his, she said.<br />
Are you mad, your shoulders don&#39;t even reach his belly, he doesn&#39;t even need to climb on you!<br />
You know what, what the hell, it&#39;s your funeral! You&#39;re going to feel that cock in your stomach, which is way deeper for horses.<br />
As she opened the stall they let the draft horse stallion whose name was MOJO into the breading area, which could be accessible and viewed from beind a glass frame by bystanders as publicity.<br />
MOJO was 4 and a half years old and he had experience breading with mares and pulling carrieges and plows, and so he was strong even for a horse, something which the filly didn&#39;t take into account either.<br />
As her trainer left the enclosure she cut a plastic container with a few milliliters of horse feromones and splotches it on the 1 and a half year old filly&#39;s back while saying, I hope you know what you&#39;re doing because you&#39;re by far not his first and he pulls carrieges that are 6 times heavier then you for a living, so those hind legs of his are going to drive you into the ground like a skewer. <br />
As the trainer said that she left Mark alone so that the situation he was in could down on him. <br />
He was a 17 yearold former boy who was about to be skewered by the largest draft horse stallion that he had seen and he also had feromones on his back. <br />
As the audience started to gather outside the glass panel they started to take photos and wonder who let such a hunk of a stallion mount a filly so young. <br />
They thaught that a filly so young couldn&#39;t possibly take a stallion so large, however there was no stopping the stallion now as he got a whif of the feromones that the trainer had splotched on his back before she left which drove him insane as his member jutted out from his sheath and at full length it looked like it was half as long as the filly itself. <br />
What came next dawned on the new filly as the stallion started lapping at the feromones that were on her back while also nipping at her mane while she just stood still in shock at what she was doing, and then without warning he jumped on the filly back. She was just barely large enough to lift his fore legs off the ground and sustain him in the air, however she couldn&#39;t keep him up long as her forelegs gave out and she was face down on the dirt with her backside up in the air exposint her new folds. <br />
As the stallion fell down on her back on all fours she squeezed her forelegs with his own and noticed how large the difference in their hooves was as his were much lager then hers. <br />
After he properly secured the mare he began the process of trying to insert his flared cock into her teardropped cunt. <br />
At first he had a hard time even backing down to secure the filly due to the length of his member however eventually managed to find the right opening and he parted her folds for the first time in an amazing display of wickering from the virgin filly as she jolted and spasmed at just the tip. <br />
The stallion had enough of this as he was getting aroused as he pushed the entire length of his cock into the virgin pussy forcing open a pathway for the first time in its entirety. The shear pain and pleasure caused by the stallion hilting her on her first mating session caused her to pass out for half a minute. <br />
When she recovered her senses she found herself properly secured herself between the broad forelegs of the draft horse stallion and his hind quarters. <br />
The stallion was doing broad strokes every time plunging himself as deep as he could and hilting the mare. By the time the filly woke up the pleasure was &quot;mounting&quot; and when she opened her eyes she saw her forehooves and his forehooves locking her down however just as soon as she tried to say something a tingle descended from her belly to her groin area like an intense and pleasurable burn that evolved into the best orgasm that she had ever had. <br />
She wickered and her legs spasmed as she tried to communicate something only to have her neck drowned by moans and nickers while the pleasure was building again and again never letting down like a Rollercoaster ride. Zing Zing ZING ZING <br />
pleasurable bursts that just kept on coming. <br />
Her pussy just kept on spilling its juices trying to ease the experience in vain while the stallions pleasure was intense as he was getting close.<br />
With a loud Nicker and a huff of air the stallion hilted the mare fully and used his forelegs to drive the shaft as deep as he could.<br />
The mare could feel the body of the stallion pulsing on her back and his individual spasms as his load was thrown all around her insides prompting the burning hot liquid to trigger another orgasm as the mare whenied on last time and quivered as she passed out in the grass once again with the stallion still hilted in her.<br />

I would love other creators to create other stories such as these. <br />

Amongst my favorites creators is:  Anonymous  (I would love to see his interpretation of Mark&#39;s change)</p>
