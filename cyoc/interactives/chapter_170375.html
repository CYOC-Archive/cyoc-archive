<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been 1 week since Ekaterina also became an Arachne. Her body was quite large, when compared to her daughter. Because of that though, she was trapped inside of Camilla&#39;s private suite underneath the hospital. The quite massive studio apartment had been rearranged in order to properly fit her new body, but the door was the only issue. If not for Camilla&#39;s quick thinking to do the procedure inside the room, she would have been stuck inside the lab.<br />
<br />
Ekaterina found being part spider to be quite enjoyable actually. She felt lightweight as her new body actually somehow weighed less than her human one. Plus with 6 more eyes, keeping an eye on her baby&#39;s was extremely easy. Having spinnerettes wasn&#39;t that bad either, as she had decided to take up tailoring as a hobby, in order to make her girls, as well as herself proper clothing. That being said, Ekaterina seemed to be ok with being completely naked and apparently found it to be extremely comfortable, even when in front of people. She now only wore clothing at the request of Camilla. Otherwise, reguardless of who was present, she would be naked. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Camilla. She had meddled with the Arachne program slightly. Nothing major, but now nestled between Ekaterina&#39;s front legs, right where her human and soider halfs met, was her human pussy. And not only had the both of them begin seriously going out, but Ekaterina was now the one to usually engage them in romantic activities. <br />
<br />
Tonjght would be extremely special for both of them. Ekaterina finally had asked Camilla to have sex. She just couldn&#39;t keep sleeping next to such a massive cock and not become aroused by it. She had committed to being a women hermaphrodite 100% by now, and had no intention on returning, ever, to her male self. Ekaterina was here to stay for good. She also felt a slight amount of pride whenever Camilla would get an erection seeing her naked body. It had been rough at first, but after 3 days, she had become completely in live with being always naked. Her pussy was not something she was ashamed of, neither were her mammoth sized tits. So why should she hide them? Was her thinking. <br />
<br />
Ekaterina was working on her third onesie for Minerva as she had just completed Arachne&#39;s third yesterday. Over the course of their stay, it was discovered that Arachne was loved by spiders. Same with Ekaterina. Numerous times the both of them have been minding their own business when all of a sudden, a few spiders would approach them, and sometimes even would bring bugs they have killed. While gross, Ekaterina appreciated their offerings, as she knew they meant no harm to her or her babys. <br />
<br />
Actually, most of the spiders in the hospital had flocked to their appartment. And each morning, Arachne would be covered in non-sticky webbing, like a blanket, with hundreds of spiders near her in the crib. <br />
<br />
Minerva apparently liked them as well, but in a difference sense. She would eat them... constantly. Camilla reassured Ekaterina that Minerva was completely safe eating them, as her body&#39;s venom, as well as any other toxin tolerance was unparalleled due to the nano machines. <br />
<br />
Ekaterina wondered if she was a bad parent for letting this stuff happen. She trusted Camilla&#39;s judgment as a doctor, and so far at least, both babys seemed healthy and happy. Even Arachne still acted just like any other newborn, as in all she really did was eat, poop, cry, and sleep.<br />
<br />
Minerva was the odd one, given that she ate spiders regularly, and rarely cried. But it was possibly because she was a few months older than her sister. Even though she ate spiders, she was not a danger for Arachne, even though she would sometimes suck on one of her legs. Arachne&#39;s chitin-reinforced exoskeleton which covered her arms and entire lower half made sure of that. Actually Arachne would giggle whenever Minerva did that. &quot;Maybe it ticked?&quot; Wondered Ekaterina. <br />
<br />
Ekaterina&#39;s family had visited her once they heard she was awake, but as one would expect, they didn&#39;t take the news that not only has their grandchild become a half spider, but their son, who has become their half spider daughter, who also is engaged to the bioengineer responsible, and who is also contracted to be their test subject for their research, very well. They initially wanted to sue, but Ekaterina declined to press any charges, and furthermore said that if they were just going to cause trouble, that they could just leave and come back later once they could better handle things. She had expected her father to at least give her some gripe about her being too accommodating, and also for them to leave quickly due to her mothers arachnophobia. And true to her expectations, they didn&#39;t stay long, as her mother looked like she was about to pass out at any second once Arachne was in her arms. Maybe only she was just unable to find her daughter as anything but cute.</p>
