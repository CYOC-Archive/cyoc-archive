<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The guy thought a second or two before answering: “First for that test we will need you to get naked, or at least down to your underwear. That will be your decision.” Mark looked nervous at him, then over to the girl, but she had her back to him at the moment.<br />
“Are you joking with me right now?”<br />
“No, the will be in the way, and probably get to warm. So please, just get ready.” With that he also turned away and headed over to the girl. Mark gulped as he started to strip down, deciding to keep his boxers on. After he had put his clothes to the side he only said: “Finished.”<br />
The guy turned back around, mustering Mark´s body shortly, before he said: “Okay, I see you decided to keep your underwear on. Now for the test itself, you will need to put this on.” With that, he handed Mark something folded, resembling fur. Mark eyed it skeptical, but took it anyway.<br />
When Mark let it drop to unfold it, he looked down at an very realistic looking silver and black striped cat costume, with only the head missing. He chuckled at that. “You really are kidding me right?”<br />
The girl responded this time: “No, we want to see how realistic this can look, and how it feels, but also be able to test some things, with we couldn´t if we would wear it ourselves. Now, please step in and put it on up to your neck, and then we can continue.”<br />
Sighing, Mark stepped into the opening and pulled the costume up. The first thing he noticed was the cool surface of its insides. “Why is it so cool inside of it?”<br />
“The inside is coated with a gel to keep the wearer cool. It´s also the reason we wanted you to strip, that way you won´t overheat. As far as we have tested, it reacts to clothes in the opposite way, so they would get really warm. Now keep going.” The guy explained.<br />
So Mark pulled it up further. It was interesting that he could wiggle his toes and see the costume responding accordingly. He felt something hard just above his ass, and turning around could say it was the base of the costumes tail, so he didn´t need to ask. When he had his hands in the front-paws of the costume, he could easily wiggle each finger in the glove like paws.<br />
Seeing Mark had the costume on up to his neck, the girl asked: “How do you feel with the costume?”<br />
“It´s really comfortable, and I feel what you meant with clothes getting warm with my boxers, but its not that bad. And it´s interesting to see how it responded to my movements inside.” Mark replied truthfully.<br />
After writing something down, the guy got the next part for Mark, the head-piece of the costume. “Let me help you with that. I guess with this paws it will be hard to put the head on and seal the hidden zipper.”<br />
Mark didn´t notice the evil grin the guy had and let him help put the cat head over his own. Then he heard the zipper being pulled shut around his neck. He could clearly see out the eyes of the costume, but other than the cool inside of the costume the head felt tingly around him, and warmer than the rest.<br />
While Mark was distracted, the guy put the last part on Mark, a brown leather collar. The clasp was locked behind Mark´s neck, and connected to the costumes zipper as well. “All in place, Cho. For now he is locked in.”<br />
Mark turned to the guy, who was still grinning evilly. “What do you mean locked in?”<br />
“Well” Cho said, “what Chris here meant was that without help you won´t get out of this costume anymore. While it would be nearly impossible to open the zipper with these paws, getting the collar open is impossible, and as it is connected to the zipper as well, it won´t come off, either. Now let´s see if the next part works as intended.”<br />
Mark looked shocked at the girl. “But you will get it off of me later, right?”<br />
Instead of giving an answer the girl activated something. Mark felt the cool gel start to move around him, and he had no idea what happened next. He couldn´t control his body, which simply dropped forward onto all fours. Many parts of his skin started to tingle under the gel, and he was unable to do anything against it.<br />
What Mark couldn´t know was that the gel was reworking his body to fit in the costume completely, meaning his body was reshaped into a cat. It took a couple of minutes in with Mark was short of panicking inside the costume, but nothing was visible on the outside. Soon the gel stopped moving around him, still a layer between his skin and the costume. But instead of the cool gel it became harder slowly, as it glued the costume to his skin.<br />
After around ten minutes of activating the process, instead of a human in a silver and black stripped cat costume there sat a human-sized cat in the middle of the room.<br />
Suddenly, Mark could move again. When his tries to get up again failed, he asked panicked: “What have you done with me?”<br />
Cho had written down something and now looked down at Mark. “The gel also held a kind of nanobots, which have reformed your body to look like a naked cat. Then some of them died of, which followed an reaction in the gel to work as glue, so the costume is now your skin. So to your earlier question, no, we won´t get it off of you, as that isn´t possible anymore.”<br />
Mark screamed at her and tried to jump towards her, but while his body had reformed, his mind hadn´t grasped his new anatomy, which resulted in him landing headfirst on the ground in front of her feet. Shaking his head to ease the pain, he asked: “Why did you do this to me?”<br />
Now Chris laughed behind him. “We couldn´t risk someone knowing, and that we needed a tester wasn´t a lie. Now you won´t tell anyone anything. Cho, are we ready for the next part?”<br />
Cho nodded and activated the next part, and just as Mark wanted to say something he was again unable to do anything. Slowly Mark begun to shrink smaller, as another set of nanobots compressed his body. It took around ten minutes again before the process was finished, leaving Mark in size of a big house cat, maybe a fifth of the size of his cat body before, and around an eighth of his standing size as a human.<br />
As Mark could move again, he was shocked to look up at the giant form of Cho before him. She scribbled something down while she said: “Now you are down to the size of a big house cat, we can easily keep you as our pet, which should stop you from telling anyone anything.”<br />
Mark looked shocked up at her. “I wasn´t going to tell anyone, as I didn´t understand  most of it anyway. I was just looking for a way out of the building nearer to my dorm.” He noticed how high his voice sounded now.<br />
“Better save than sorry, now you can´t tell anyone, even if you wanted to. Or you won´t be able to when we do this.” With that Chris bowed down above Marks shrunken form and pushed Mark in the neck with the collar.<br />
Mark was startled that Chris was above him, and screamed: “Go away and don´t touch me.” But all that was heard was a series of “Meow´s” from him. That shocked Mark yet again.<br />
“That´s better, a cat shouldn´t talk. As you can see, I just activated something similar to a translator that is placed in the costume. It silences your voice and translates anything you say the way it is programmed, and as a cat that means you will be meowing for now.” Cho explained smiling.<br />
“It can be switched off again, which would result in you regaining your voice, but don´t try, you can´t reach that switch. And even when you could, it requires either mine or Cho´s finger prints to work.” Chris explained from behind him.<br />
Mark cried in horror. He was reduced to a simple house cat in only half an hour. “Don´t make so much noise, little cat. Or we might bring you to a shelter. By now the zipper is vanished, so even if someone removed the collar there isn´t anything anyone would see but an ordinary cat. Work with us, and maybe we will see if we can turn you back. Or don´t, and live as a cat from now on.” Cho said a bit annoyed.<br />
“As we never asked who you are we will need to find a new name for you. I think even if we would know your name it wouldn´t be fitting for a cat anyway. Any ideas Cho?” Chris asked her while Mark was silent, shocked by what Cho had threaten him with.<br />
“Hmm... As he is gender-less now we could take any name, we aren´t limited to male names.” As Mark hissed angry at her, she laughed. “You have decided to keep your underwear on. The gel couldn´t dissolve it, only work around it. Your ass will work normally, but your cock is trapped and not working this way. How about Lucky? Maybe he is lucky enough to get changed back later, and that name can be interpret both male and female?”<br />
Chris nodded in approval, and Mark couldn´t do anything against being renamed into Lucky. He really hoped they would change him back later.</p>
