<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time they reached Shane&#39;s apartment, Ryan had already gone completely silent. So Shane helped get him to the couch and went to get a damp cloth. Unfortunately for Ryan, Shane had a floor to ceiling mirror against the wall across from him. In it, he clearly could see the woman, positioned exactly as he was on the couch. Her every movement mirrored his own. Her face showed the same, empty stare he was currently giving the mirror.<br />
<br />
Since when had his reflection become that of a woman&#39;s? He remembered it being his normal male self back in the shoe store. Maybe something about that place was causing him to now hallucinate or something. It was then that he tried to remember their claim. &quot;Guaranteed to fit&quot; was it? What if that was not talking about the shoe, and instead, it caused you to &quot;fit&quot; the shoe? &quot;Hehe, fucking hell.&quot; Said Ryan, giving himself a pity laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Asked Shane who returned with a damp washcloth. Eyan looked up at her concerned expression. &quot;Describe me, more accurately, please describe my appearance, if you could&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if that will help&quot;. Smiled Shane softly. &quot;Lets see here. I see a beautiful woman with long dark hair. She has a slender build, but not to an unhealthy amount. Bright green eyes. Her breasts are the same size as my own, or close to it. Her waist is narrow, and shes got a really, really nice ass, if I do say so myself. Moving on, she has a pair of gorgeous legs.   Basically everything that either I wish I had myself, or want my partner to have&quot; described Shane. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is as I thought. Something is going on, and for some reason, it seems as if the world now thinks I am this woman. I know it sounds crazy right? But honestly, 3 hours ago, I was just a normal guy. Even now, when I look down at myself, I still see only my male body.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shane looked you up and down again. &quot;Sorry Ryan, I just don&#39;t see it. You are still the same beautiful woman I just met on the sidewalk. Hang on, is this your way of saying that you do not want to date me? This isn&#39;t some kind of a sick prank, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no. I really would love to date you. Its just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So then just say yes and start dating me.&quot; Said an exasperated Shane. She looked almost desperate even. &quot;Look, it is clear to me that you have some kind of crazy mental shit going on at the moment. And I want to help you through that. You say that you are really a man, yet all I can see is my dream girlfriend. So how about this. You will start to and continue to date me, at least until you turn back into a man which then we will discuss how to proceed, where we pick either option 1, and we break up, or pick option 2, and continue to date with plans to get married. Deal?&quot; proposed Shane adamantly, as she climbed up on top of Ryan. &quot;But for now, while it seems like you are feeling a bit better, I want to make sure. So you are going to stay here with me for a bit longer. Then we will take care of your other businesses once you are able to walk normally again that is&quot; grinned Shane, as she lowered herself down upon him. <br />
<br />
They both begin kissing, as his mind pushed all other thoughts out of his focus for the mean time. He could feel how nice she felt lying down on top of him. She was fairly light weight, so it didn&#39;t bother him in the slightest either. Her large boobs were pressing up against his chest, and it was a glorious sensation. He enjoyed it so much, that even his own nipples were becomming erect. After a few more seconds, it was not just his nipples, but his entire body felt all tingly. However he was too focused on kissing Shane to care. Even when he thought he felt an odd weight appear on his chest which was different from Shane&#39;s boobs. He mearly gave it a quick glance, and seeing how nothing was different, he disregarded it entirely. They carried on for about another half hour or so. <br />
<br />
&quot;We probably should get what you needed to do over with first Ryan&quot; said Shane, stopping their kissing before it progressed any further. &quot;You did sound like it was rather urgant at least.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, yeah well. You aren&#39;t wrong about that&quot; replied Ryan with a sigh. He went to get up onto his feet, which still were inside the boots, when he suddenly lost balance and nearly fell forward. Shane luckily caught him in time though. &quot;Thanks, guess I was just a bit wobbly from the shoes&quot; he said as an excuse. Of course the boots were the furthest ting from the cause. If anything, he had never felt more stable in his life. They truely were his perfect footware in every sense of the phrase. They felt as good as if they were his own legs and feet. In fact, he didn&#39;t want to remove them if at all possible. He just wanted his old pair of shoes back. <br />
<br />
No, the reason for his stumble was the sudden down pull of weight from his chest. His chest was no different looking, nor did he have anything stuck to his shirt. Shane, who had watched him from the moment he stumbled curiously asked &quot;What? Is there something wrong with your boobs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Boobs! Was that what he was feeling? Oddly though, when he held his hand against his chest, he felt the same flat surface as always. But when he shook a bit, he definitely felt the weight bounce side to side. He was now feeling just his boob&#39;s weight. It felt like 20 or so pounds of new weight was just hanging there, and he didn&#39;t even get any of the benefits, nor could wearing a bra help him, as he didn&#39;t actually physically have them. Not wanting to have to explain all of this to Shane though, he simply said he was fine now and they left the appartment.</p>
