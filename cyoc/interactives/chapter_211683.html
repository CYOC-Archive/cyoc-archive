<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed Addams had a frown on his face as he stomped around the school premises. &quot;Where the F!&quot;#&quot; is that fatass, now that School is out, we can finally be around Boss, and the dumbass is nowhere to be found&quot; he grumbled while stalking the hallways. &quot;Guy must have gotten hungry again, that lard ass&quot; said Ed as he went to the nearest Janitor closet.<br />
<br />
Inside he found his buddy Cliff eating out of a garbage can.<br />
<br />
Cliff Huff could have been a handsome man If he took better care of himself. He had handsome features distorted by his massive weight, and unlike Ed, he had a full mane of hair on his head, styled like a mullet but with little care, seemingly being his natural look rather than something he went for, surprisingly clean despite the rest of what he wore, his mutton chops almost touched his shoulders, making his face look even wider. He was wearing a stained blue shirt with the words &quot;JANITOR - Cliff Huff&quot; embroiled on it, over a food and sweat stained wife beater, having it custom made for him since the school didn&#39;t have a big enough coveralls for his 500 pound frame. On his legs he was wearing some ratty stained shorts with a hole in the crotch, one of his rather large testicles trying to worm its way out, since the jockstrap he wore couldn&#39;t keep it contained and he wouldn&#39;t wear any other kind of underwear. He was clutching one of the garbage cans from the cafeteria, reaching into eat with his hand and pulling mostly intact food from it, &quot;Can you believe those kids? throwing away perfectly fine food? bratty kids the lot of &#39;em&quot; Said cliff as he stuffed his face silly with a particularly big piece of a burrito, still in its plastic wrapper.<br />
<br />
&quot;F!&quot;$% hell Cliff&quot; said Ed while staring at the big man eating out of the trash. &quot;Couldn&#39;t you wait a bit? I could have cooked ya something once we got home ya know? something nice for boss and something greasy for ya&quot;<br />
<br />
*Belch* Cliff burped as he smiled at his husband, &quot;You know how I get If I don&#39;t eat every hour or so, I was starving&quot; he said while drinking from a half empty soda can he took from the trash, &quot;Besides, what boss doesn&#39;t know won’t make him mad, If you don&#39;t tell him I won’t! ha!&quot; he said while laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This guy...&quot; thought Ed as he saw Cliff eating, &quot;I needed a place to stay when I found the love of my life in this town, and wouldn&#39;t you know it? my old buddy Cliff lives in town, hadn&#39;t seen him in ages, turned out he gained a lot of weight and was looking for a Job. Once I introduced him to boss, we both felt the same pull towards him, he truly is the best... &quot; Thought Ed wistfully as he adjusted his pants under his coveralls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I think about it&quot; said Cliff, &quot;it’s our 6th month anniversary today, right?&quot; he said while smiling at me with that wide face of his.<br />
<br />
I stared at the wide oaf, at 5&#39;4 he wasn&#39;t a tall guy, and most of his weight was in his mid-section, that gigantic gut of his strained his shirt as he shoved &quot;food&quot; inside his mouth, &quot;I bet Cliff hasn&#39;t seen his cock in years, the tiny thing is absolutely trapped in that gunt, at least he cleans himself properly now that Boss tells him to&quot; thought Ed. &quot;Hurry up Cliff&quot; Boss is waiting, just drop the -food-, we still need to meet up with him and finish cleaning the place up so that we can lock up. &quot;And we both know the reason we got married was because Boss found it funny&quot; said Ed gruffly &quot;Easier to manage you both if you live together&quot; he told the both of us.<br />
<br />
Cliff started regretfully at a piece of half-eaten pie on a paper plate, &quot;Come on Ed, don&#39;t worry, Boss can wait a few minutes. I still need to clean myself up a bit or he will get mad again&quot; Cliff said while gesturing at himself &quot;Besides we both know he won’t get that mad, he cares too much about us for that, I&#39;ve lost like 100 pounds since he started bossing me around!&quot; said cliff while patting his own gut, &quot;he told me he likes his daddies big and slobby, but not THAT big ha-ha&quot; he said self-deprecatingly, &quot;besides he likes making me sweat&quot; he said with a faraway look on his face &quot;Maybe tonight he will let me cum, it’s been months and I&#39;m so pent up&quot; he whined.<br />
<br />
Ed shook his head while looking at Cliff, &quot;we both know we aren&#39;t allowed to do -that- anymore&quot; he said while absentmindedly adjusting his still rather obvious erection, &quot;A daddy is always ready and willing for his boy&quot; he quoted from memory &quot;A daddy always put his boy before himself&quot; continued Cliff as if was the most natural thing to say. &quot;Daddies do not need release, a daddy already did his job while making his boy&quot; they both quoted. *Snicker* &quot;well that last one doesn&#39;t really apply to us, right?&quot; said Cliff, while eating the last crumbs from the trashcan. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Ed while frowning.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, we didn&#39;t help making our boss&quot; answered Cliff as he stood up and walked towards the sink on the far back. <br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; said Ed grumblingly, &quot;are you saying we aren&#39;t true daddies or something??&quot; he said while tensing his muscles and feeling his anger rising.<br />
<br />
As Cliff washed his hands rather mechanically, like a guy following a set of instructions rather than someone who naturally knew how to wash himself, he turned his head around to look at Ed and said, &quot;Of course we are his daddies, he owns us, you know that&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what the F&quot;#$&quot; are you talking about??&quot; Ed said rising his voice, &quot;I know I ain&#39;t the smartest tool in the shed, hell I never even finished grade school, but you ain&#39;t much better, Mr. GED&quot; said Ed while walking menacingly towards Cliff, now I know you went to the fancy army and all that, but we both know you got shitcanned for being a dumbass, so Spit. It. Out. said Ed emphasizing each word by jabbing his finger into Cliff&#39;s firm gut.<br />
<br />
Cliff smile was gone by this point, and while he let Ed jab his fingers into his gut, he felt his anger rising all the same. And just when he was about to give Ed a piece of his mind, he felt a weird ripple like wave going through him, giving him a sense that something big had happened, but no idea what.<br />
<br />
Ed shook his head after the ripple went through him, his anger seemingly forgotten as he absentmindedly scratched his ass with a blank look on his face, making his -too many times- broken nose all the more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Cliff just stared at Ed having forgotten what they were just talking about but knowing without a shadow of a doubt that it was something dumb and useless. &quot;Boss is waiting! and we are late!&quot; thought Cliff as he washed his face mechanically, just like his boss told him an adult should know.</p>
