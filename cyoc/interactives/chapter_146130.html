<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stella entered the living room with a concerned look on her face.<br />
<br />
You tried to smile, but it was more like a grimace, as you clutched your stomach when you felt another jolt of pain. It had been like this for some time already. You were laying on the large bench in front of the TV. Some game show was currently on, but you weren&#39;t really in a state where you could properly watch it.<br />
<br />
You had your arms around your stomach, and your knees against your body. Your leg muscles felt incredibly sore, and standing on them really hurt, when the pain suddenly overtook you this afternoon. Your groin had been hit first, and the feelings spread towards your legs and up your hips and lower belly, stopping somewhere below your belly button. The aches had been nagging, and had gradually worsened over time, making you wonder if you had suddenly gotten a hernia or something, moved your back wrongly or something. These symptoms had some similarities.<br />
<br />
For obvious reasons, you had decided informing your wife first was the best idea. If the pains worsened even more, the two of you would go to the hospital for check-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sweetie,&quot; Stella greeted. She dropped her bag onto the ground and slid the scarf off her neck. She walked over to where you lay on the bench, and stroked your cheek in an almost motherly fashion, a side you started seeing more and more often these days.<br />
<br />
&#39;Training to become a mother&#39;, you thought, as you took one of her hands in yours and held it for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not good,&quot; you grunted, &quot;my stomach hurts like a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it gotten any worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shook your head, as much as you were able to. There were drops of sweat on your brow, in fact, you noticed you had been sweating a whole lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;At around six it felt the worst. I guess it&#39;s been about the same since then, but I&#39;ve just gotten used to it.&quot; I groaned once more, feeling the soreness when I tried to move my legs from their uncomfortable position.<br />
<br />
Stella rose from her squatted position next to the bench you lay on. &quot;Easy does it, Andy. Can you stand up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; you grunted, &quot;carry me to bed? I&#39;m exhausted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m not? You really worried me when you called me. You sounded like you were undergoing torture the whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was at six! And it was also the reason I called you in the first place.&quot; You panted. &quot;Pretty much felt like it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Andy, but I can&#39;t carry you,&quot; she said with a nervous laugh. &quot;But I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella got to work. She went upstairs, and after some noises of the ladder towards the attic being folded open, you heard a large thud, of something soft landing on the ground a floor lower. After some grunts and huffs, your wife appeared in the living room again with a large white mattress following behind her.<br />
<br />
You gasped in relief, even when you did none of the work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella, you&#39;re a life-saver.&quot; You said in many thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, poor prince. Your lackey will take care of you.&quot; She smiled teasingly as she said it, and approached you.<br />
<br />
You leaned in for the kiss, groaning a bit as you had to move once more from your fetal position. Your exhaustion left you gasping for air after the passionate embrace, and you attempted to stand up when Stella put your arm around her shoulders and lifted you up with her. It was hard, but you succeeded.<br />
<br />
The mattress lay not more than three meters away from the bench, but its softness and its coolness was much more comfortable than the alternative.<br />
<br />
In only your lazy clothes, a white t-shirt, boxers and sweatpants, you dozed off on your side, dead-tired.<br />
<br />
Your heart filled when you were woken up from your drowsy state a few hours later, when your beautiful and caring wife came to lay behind you. You were the inner spoon this time. It was at around midnight by then, and you felt that the pain had faded a bit, although still there mainly around your crotch area. You felt relieved when you found out that you could move your legs again without the intense feeling of soreness.<br />
<br />
Actual sleep came easy after that.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
The things your husband had told you, weren&#39;t unlike the stories you heard from some colleagues at work, as well as your twin sister. Hanna, the recently hired secretary was feeling similar things below the belt, and left work early as result of these sensations. You had seen her walk out of the office with her arms clutched around her stomach, then stopping as she moved her hands to her crotch, as if being hit in her soft spot.<br />
<br />
Yes, it hurt down there when kicked, even for women.<br />
<br />
You hoped everything had turned out alright for her. Considering the look on Andy&#39;s face last night, even after he fell asleep when you put a blanket over him, it seemed the two of them had really been in pain.<br />
<br />
Weird though, some sort of virus or something? Or an illness, that went specifically for everything below the belt?<br />
<br />
You looked over towards Andy, lying beside you. He was still passed out, sleeping on his belly. His face looked calm. He even looked to be smiling somewhat, so the worst of all things must have been over by now.<br />
<br />
It had been a good choice to stay home, get a good night&#39;s rest.<br />
<br />
Going to the hospital meant high costs and confrontations with insurance policies, something you didn&#39;t really need right now. You were just planning on buying a new house to live in. More spacious.<br />
<br />
For your baby.<br />
<br />
You smiled at the reminder, stroking your lower belly.<br />
<br />
That reminded you...<br />
<br />
You sat up from the mattress, and threw one leg over your husband&#39;s back. The sheets were thin, since he had been sweating like crazy last night. You remembered once more that according to him, his legs had felt incredibly sore, and they hurt at the slightest movements.<br />
<br />
You hoped to relieve that with a gentle massage.<br />
<br />
You started at his calves, stroking the muscles, and gently pushing your thumbs in the middle. From behind you, you heard an appreciative grunt, and noted that Andy was at least half awake by now. You pushed your fingers in the soft skin of his right thigh, and moved his lower leg up to feel the muscles strain at the pressure put on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm.&quot; Andy groaned.<br />
<br />
You looked behind you, and found that he had shifted his arms under his chin, still with his eyes closed. He wore a cheeky smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning babe,&quot; you said melodically. &quot;All better now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, my feet and ass still hurt,&quot; he answered. &quot;Have you gone over those yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
You snickered. &quot;Nope. The only ones I still need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy shifted his legs up, so his feet sprung into the air. The blanked slid off of them, leaving them exposed. &quot;Feet first please,&quot; your husband muttered.<br />
<br />
Your smile faltered a bit, and you became slightly confused by what you saw before you.<br />
<br />
&#39;His feet used to be... rougher, right?&#39;<br />
<br />
You examined the soles of his feet, still rubbing them with your thumbs, as not to startle Andy.<br />
<br />
He had a habit of walking outside barefoot. Some callus had formed over time, but no trace on the feet you had in your hands.<br />
<br />
Andy hissed. &quot;Easy now, sweetie. They&#39;re still sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked back at him. His face wore an expression of bliss nevertheless.<br />
<br />
You decided to get off him, then threw the thin blanket off of him, leaving him with only his t-shirt and sweatpants, exposed to the cool temperature of your living room. He shivered a bit.<br />
<br />
You stared.<br />
<br />
Just... stared.<br />
<br />
Small feet, full thighs, and a large, heart-shaped, feminine butt.<br />
<br />
You ran a hand down his legs, from his tailbone, along his ass cheeks, all the way down to the tips of his toes.<br />
<br />
Andy shivered again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes baby,&quot; he moaned. &quot;Do that again. That felt nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
You obliged, curious at the new shapes. The third time, you were a bit rougher, and slid a hand down to his crotch.<br />
<br />
You felt... nothing?<br />
<br />
Andy shivered again, moaning.<br />
<br />
You moved your hands to his back, and removed his sweatpants. You slid them over his rounded ass, and down his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes baby!&quot; He said with a grunt. His eyes were still closed, but his expression betrayed lust and anticipation. His butt wiggled slightly as he repositioned himself on top of the mattress.<br />
<br />
His boxers had been of light grey color.<br />
<br />
Right in the middle however, you saw some fluid soak through the fabric. Said fabric moved along with the clench of an abdominal muscle.<br />
<br />
In disbelief, you stuck a single finger against the fabric. In reaction to the touch, you felt something weakly clench around it.<br />
<br />
With a surprised squeak, you retracted your finger. Andy moved as soon as he heard your distressed weep, turning to his side to see you holding your hands before your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Your brain twisted and turned, gears creaking as you short-circuited. You pointed a slender finger towards his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;See for yourself,&quot; you peeped.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Your wife&#39;s look was a mix between shock and confusion, but most of all, worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
Her hands were covering her mouth. You were wondering what the worry was about. The soreness and hurt you had felt last night was gone, so the worst should&#39;ve been over, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;See for yourself,&quot; Stella said with a squeak, pointing behind you.<br />
<br />
Looking behind you, you saw what was wrong. It looked like your ass had expanded exponentially, while your legs had become slender and, further back, your feet smaller. Bringing yourself to a seated position on top of the mattress, you found that not a single trace of hair was to be found on both your upper, and lower legs. Your thighs had become bigger too.<br />
<br />
&#39;Just...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Just like Stella&#39;s legs. No, just like women&#39;s legs!&#39;<br />
<br />
You froze. You felt muscles clench, muscles you had never felt before in your entire life.<br />
<br />
A drop of... something, &#39;sweat?&#39;, rolled down your crotch, down your... ass crack?<br />
<br />
It felt empty. Something was missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; you muttered, as you slid off your boxers, to reveal what was down there. Stella squeaked again, in disbelief.<br />
<br />
You just stared.<br />
<br />
Down there, in between your legs, was a wet, gaping pussy.</p>
