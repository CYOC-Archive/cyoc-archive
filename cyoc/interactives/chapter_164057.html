<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily dreamt of being home as normal and getting ready for what she thought was school. In her dream however, she walked to a local farm instead of school. There were donkeys in the field. As she approached them, she started turning into a donkey herself!<br />
<br />
She woke up as her change completed.<br />
<br />
Emily however, didn&#39;t wake up in her bed in her house as the girl she was only a day before. What she woke up to didn&#39;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
The sight of the walls of a pen as well as two donkeys sleeping in front of her--one laying over a slightly larger one--greeted Emily. <br />
<br />
A scent not unlike a barn permeated Emily&#39;s nostrils. While strong, it made Emily feel oddly comfortable like the smell of one&#39;s hometown or home. <br />
<br />
The sound of nearby water filled her ears. It sounded calm. There was also the undeniable scent of saltwater. This had to be the ocean.<br />
<br />
She felt the sensation of cold stone under her body—a body that felt wrong in more ways than one. Everything felt out of proportion. She also wondered why her ears felt so long and why her jaw and nose seemed to have merged. Emily tried to feel her mouth only to see a hoofed foreleg where her right arm should have been.<br />
<br />
Gasping, she tried to stand only for her altered center of gravity to cause her to fall onto all fours--the clop and sensation telling her it her four hooves.<br />
<br />
Everything came back to her. Last night wasn&#39;t a nightmare. Emily was on Pleasure Island, she was a donkey in a pen and two other donkeys were Stephanie and Alison.<br />
<br />
Emily blinked—Stephanie and Alison were naked!<br />
<br />
Someone had removed their clothing overnight. Emily felt a breeze around her hindquarters. A quick look— something much more difficult than looking down as a human—confirmed that Emily was also naked.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure what to think of this latest turn of events.<br />
<br />
When Emily was naked as a girl, she was just that, a girl. It left her vulnerable and yet, in the right circumstances, she liked being able to just be a girl, even if only for a few minutes at a time in her room. She however knew her limits. Emily wouldn&#39;t have been willing to strip down in front of people.<br />
<br />
Donkeys didn&#39;t worry about privacy. They&#39;d explore those feelings when they felt like it, sometimes even if people were watching. If the donkeys knew they were safe, they wouldn&#39;t wait until the people left. They&#39;d only stop if someone protested.<br />
<br />
Never wearing clothing again meant that everyone from that point on would be able to see everything Emily considered private. Yes, she looked a lot different and people seeing her now wouldn&#39;t be seeing her as a girl. Just because she’d become a donkey however, didn&#39;t mean she was okay with her body becoming an open house.<br />
<br />
That even what Emily was had changed made Emily feel worse about her lack of clothing. Without clothing, Emily couldn&#39;t deny that she was a donkey. It forced her to face the reality of what she’d become in a way that wearing human clothes might have allowed her to hide even if only in a small way.<br />
<br />
Emily however, realized that that as wrong as it was, there was nothing she could do about it. She pondered that there could be a bright side to all of this.<br />
<br />
The strange thoughts and feelings she was experiencing were growing stronger. Emily knew that giving into those feelings would be easy. She also knew that what was easy was not always what was best for her. Coming to Pleasure Island and acting the way she did was easy for herself and the others. Taking that easy route however was why they were now donkeys.<br />
<br />
She knew what the Coachman had done—and appeared to be getting away with doing—to she and the others was wrong. The lawlessness of their state as donkeys however did nothing to change the fact of their situation. While she had hope of finding a cure, she’d never heard of a donkey turning into a human. It could well be that this change was permanent and she and the others would have no choice but to accept it.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t right or fair but Emily knew that life seldom was. This was a change they were going to have to deal with and that was that.<br />
<br />
She knew she couldn&#39;t simply accept this. There had to be a cure out there somewhere. Even if no one had yet found one, Emily knew she couldn&#39;t simply give up.<br />
<br />
Emily paced back and forth for a few seconds. She looked at Alison and Stephanie. They looked peaceful and even cute sleeping together.<br />
<br />
Without clothing, they&#39;d probably eventually start to feel the same temptations Emily already felt. At this point however, Emily wasn&#39;t sure how they&#39;d feel about this. Alison was too young to see nudity in the way Emily was seeing it. Stephanie seemed to like being a donkey. Emily had a feeling Stephanie would get a real thrill out of this, even if there was still a degree of innocence to it.<br />
<br />
Someone approached the stall. It was the Coachman. <br />
<br />
Emily wanted to bite and give him good kick with her hindquarters. At that moment, she was glad she was naked. Her shorts could well have restricted her ability to kick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, dear lady, I see that you&#39;re angry,&quot; the man said. &quot;You might even be thinking about biting me Ah, but one does not bite the hand that feeds you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily saw that the Coachman had hay, it smelled wonderful. She’d liked the smell of hay as a girl but now its scent was ambrosia to Emily. Her stomach grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you take our clothes?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, you still talk. Well lady, donkeys also don&#39;t wear clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily watched as Alison and Stephanie seemed to sniff the air. The scent of the hay must have been like the world greatest wakeup call to them.<br />
<br />
Alison woke up and seemed to try to stand on two feet before she fell back onto Stephanie.<br />
<br />
Stephanie looked up at Alison. &quot;Easy there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison looked at Emily and Stephanie. She hung her ears as realization set in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still a donkey!&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
Stephanie&#39;s reaction was almost disturbingly calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me to, we all are,&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come you girls are naked?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re naked too,&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
Alison looked at her forelegs and then back as best as she could at the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww, we can&#39;t be naked!&quot; Alison cried.<br />
<br />
The Coachman started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah my beautiful lady, but it is. The joke is just on you,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come we&#39;re naked?&quot; Alison asked. &quot;I never took my clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He must have taken our clothes when we were asleep,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my clothes back!&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being naked is the last of your problems, my girl,&quot; the man said. &quot;Now, be good little donkeys and have something to eat and drink. You have a busy day ahead of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily watched as he dropped the hay over the wall of the pen before he walked away for a minute. When the man came back, he had a large bucket. The Coachman heaved the bucket over the side of the pen and dropped it on the ground.<br />
<br />
He walked off soon after.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want my clothes back,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think he’s going to give them back Alison,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I can&#39;t be naked! Everyone will see me! My body is private! My Mom told me that,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;Donkeys don&#39;t wear clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t they?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t know what clothes are,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;Anyway, our hooves would make it hard to pull down our underwear when we have to go to the bathroom. Dresses, shirts and skirts would just get in the way and get caught on stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess so,&quot; Alison said. &quot;It&#39;s still embarrassing and kinda weird though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie stood on her hind legs for a few moments and grinned goofily grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Alison, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re seeing us naked as girls,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;They won&#39;t even know it&#39;s us &#39;cause we look so different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily found it ironic that the one thing that could hamper their rescue could also allow them to get away with things more readily then if people knew the truth about them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so but just because we&#39;re donkeys now doesn&#39;t mean I like people seeing me naked,&quot; Alison said. &quot;And it doesn&#39;t mean I want to be naked all of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it this way, Alison,&quot; Emily said. &quot;No one is going to get upset about a donkey being naked and enjoying it. It&#39;s like a donkey has a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wear clothes once you change back,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;In the meantime, don&#39;t be afraid to let go a little and have some fun with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I can try. I don&#39;t get it, Stephanie. Don&#39;t you wanna go home?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to go home or at least to my uncle&#39;s farm so I can play with his donkeys but I don&#39;t mind doing it as a jenny, even a naked one,&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re weird, Stephanie,&quot; Alison said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Stephanie grinned. &quot;Is that so bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Na, you make this not as scary,&quot; Alison said. &quot;I&#39;m still scared and I still wanna go home but you make being a donkey seem less scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Emily? What do you think about this?&quot; Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gals better sit down,&quot; Emily said. &quot;I gotta talk a lot about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trio sat down in a way similar to how dogs and cats sat. They tried not to let the fact that they seemed to know how to do it as donkeys and did it without thinking bother them too much.<br />
<br />
Emily told Stephanie and Alison and her earlier ponderings about their lack of clothing and about her thoughts on change as well as reminding them that this wasn&#39;t supposed to be a pleasurable change.<br />
<br />
Alison looked scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate scaring you, Alison,&quot; Emily said. &quot;I just don&#39;t want you to think this will be great if it&#39;s not going to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I guess you gotta help me remember that we&#39;d better escape and find help for the other kids too,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
Stephanie snorted. &quot;I&#39;ll help them too as long as you don&#39;t make me change back if I don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, not wearing clothes might make us want to do naughty stuff?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded. &quot;It might. I think it&#39;s okay to have a little fun with it. We just have to make sure we don&#39;t enjoy it so much that we don&#39;t want to go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will being donkeys make us act like donkeys?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
Stephanie looked at the hay and water.<br />
<br />
&quot;It smells wonderful,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;Come on girls, maybe eating it is acting like a donkey but I&#39;m hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie walked over to the hay and started munching away at it. She swished her tail back and forth with joy at the taste.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might a little,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
Alison cocked her head. &quot;And it&#39;ll really seem normal to act like donkeys while we&#39;re donkeys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily looked at the hay. It was getting harder to resist it by the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
She realized that it was soon going to be impossible to resist the hay. It smelled too good and Emily was too hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;That hay looks delicious,&quot; Emily said. &quot;Eating it is acting like a donkey but I&#39;d rather do that then be hungry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s stomach was grumbling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it&#39;s letting them win?&quot; Alison asked.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s okay to give in this one time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good because I&#39;m hungry too,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
Emily smiled and both joined Stephanie eating away at the delicious smelling and tasting hay.<br />
<br />
Once they were finished, they each drank some water from the bucket until the water level was too low to reach. It wasn&#39;t until they were done that they realized they&#39;d known how to eat and drink as donkeys. Eating and drinking that way had felt perfectly natural to Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was actually pretty good,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never knew hay tasted so good,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;ve never been a donkey,&quot; Stephanie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird that I knew how to eat and drink as a donkey,&quot; Alison said. &quot;It was kinda fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess turning into donkeys makes us know how to do some donkey stuff,&quot; Emily said. &quot;Like when we sat down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, what if we can&#39;t find a way to be girls again?&quot; Alison asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we&#39;re stuck like this then we just have to make best of it,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eating and drinking with my mouth was kinda fun,&quot; Alison said. &quot;So is no one making us take a bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie grinned and again stood on her hind legs. &quot;Don&#39;t forget about getting to run around naked all day and it&#39;s okay. Oh yeah and not having to go to school either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily swished her tail back and forth. She had to admit that Stephanie&#39;s balance was impressive. That she’d seem to have accepted the idea of life as a donkey so easily seemed strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that too,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
Stephanie went back down onto all fours. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if we go somewhere that isn&#39;t bad, they&#39;ll still probably make us work,&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they let us eat right and we all grow up to be big and strong jennies, it might be okay,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;I&#39;d eat my veggies if I knew they&#39;d make me strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison grinned. &quot;Being big might be fun but I still wanna try to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie seemed to want to say something but Alison continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, being stuck like this is dangerous,&quot; Alison said. &quot;Emily said they might make us do dangerous stuff, remember?&quot; Alison asked as she hung her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right Stephanie. Maybe this could help me relax a bit but being this way is too risky,&quot; Emily said. &quot;And the others need help too. We gotta at least try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay fine but just don&#39;t make me change back if I don&#39;t want to, okay?&quot; Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded. &quot;If we can change back and you wanna stay this way, that&#39;s cool.&quot;</p>
