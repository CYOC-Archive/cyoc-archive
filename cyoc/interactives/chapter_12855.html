<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Anti spyware?&quot;<br />
Tony, now a naked 10 year old stood against her side wher she sat and sighed.<br />
&quot;All those popup ads you were getting, some of those are the result of programs getting snuck onto your computer&quot;<br />
Tony restarted the computer and turned to her to get her explanation.<br />
&quot;Well, I thought I took care of it with this one thing that showed up on the screen.  I remember now it said that it had detected that stuff, spyware, on my computer and asked if I wanted to do something about it.  So I clicked yes.  I-&quot;<br />
&quot;The one with the all yellow background?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, how did you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's spyware&quot;<br />
&quot;But it-it said it would help against spyware&quot;<br />
Tony just shook his head.  He typed away furiously at the keyboard now that the laptop was starting.  He might have gone faster but his shrunken hands and shorter fingers fit the keys differently and Tony found he really had to concentrate to type correctly.  He was almost done trying to get back into the chronivac program when he felt Claire's hand running up his velvety soft thigh and then stopping on the arc of his right buttock.<br />
&quot;Hey!  I'm a 10 year old boy fer chrissakes&quot;<br />
&quot;You're still beautiful&quot; she laughed.<br />
But Tony wasn't interested.  Just as the chronivac program started, the computer crashed.  And it happened again and again.  No matter how he tried, Tony couldn't get into the chronivac program.  He found he couldn't get into any other program.  Nothing but Windows would run on Claire's laptop.  Every other program was being crowded out by the spyware.  Tony tried one last time to get into the chronivac program but the computer crashed again.  He slammed the top down on the laptop.<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; Tony shouted in his new high pitched voice.  &quot;This can't happen!  I can't be stuck like this!  I can't!  Not now!&quot;<br />
And then, to Claire's amazement, Tony ran and jumped on the bed and punched the thick comforter over and over face down, his slender legs flailing up and down at the same time.  Claire found herself instinctively sitting down on the king size bed next to him and rubbing his back while whispering soothing words.  Suddenly Tony sat bolt upright on the comforter.<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.  What the hell did I just do?&quot;<br />
&quot;You just acted like a boy about . . this tall&quot; she said touching the top of his close cropped head.<br />
&quot;Maybe I'm emotionally a 10 year old, too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Looks that way&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I can still remember everything I know about calculus and philosophy.  Ask-ask me a math problem&quot;<br />
&quot;98 times 74&quot;<br />
&quot;7252.  I feel like my power to reason is still all there.  I just . . &quot; He sighed leaning back and felt how bouncy the bed was.  He jumped to his feet and started jumping up and down atop the bed, laughing at the joy of his slender body flying up and down.  Claire grinned at the spectacle and waited for him to tire of it on his own.  It tood a few minutes.  Finally, he jumped so she could catch him and she eased his 73 pounds down to sit next to her.  <br />
&quot;You're such a beautiful boy!&quot; she said rubbing his head.  &quot;How could your parents not just heap love on a boy like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony sighed and paused wondering how she would take the news.<br />
&quot;I-I didn't look like this till I was 16.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I was about five eleven and a hundred fifty pounds with ears and a nose way too big for my face.  I was a really good runner but nothing like I am now.  I-&quot;<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;The very first time we used the chronivac, we hadn't registered our profiles yet.  I was a greyhound and it was a lot of fun.  But Jeff's sister had seen the four of us, me Jeff, Eric and Jack change.  Somehow, she told Emma Chase about it&quot;<br />
&quot;The bitter girl, the causaholic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.  And one of her causes was disliking me.  She-she got a hold of the chronivac and changed Jeff, Eric and Jack into dachsunds.  She changed me into a jackass, the biggest ugliest, smelliest, most chronic drooling jackass ever.  She intended for me to stay that way forever.  She erased me.  The original me.  All the information that the chronivac had about my original body.  She erased it.  Jeff hid it in 3 or 4 extra spots on the computer but she found all of them.  So, when we were able to get a hold of the chronivac again, we changed Jeff back to himself and changed Eric back and changed Jack back but. . &quot;<br />
&quot;But you couldn't go back?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was physically impossible.  There was one way that it could've been done.  That was if we had 50 or so pictures of me for the computer to form an accurate enough picture of me.  But you've seen the pictures in my parents' room&quot;<br />
&quot;The Cindypalooza.  A hundred pictures of her and one of you and Mark&quot;<br />
&quot;Right.  So, all I could do was to become a copy of someone else who happened along within range of the emitter or someone we could find 50 or more pictures of.  We were going through pictures on the internet and I liked this face.  He's a-a model.  We found a whole bunch of pictures of him at two model agency sites and another site.  Eventually the chronivac said it was enough.  I made some changes to his body and-&quot;<br />
Claire chuckled and tapped his penis.<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Tony admitted bashfully &quot;that and my buns and calves and shoulders.  He was pretty athletic, too but I upped all the settings anyway&quot;<br />
&quot;How did you feel about the whole thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I-I felt just a bit phony changing myself into this, but I couldn't be my original self again.  No choice I made was going to be any more authentic than any other choice, so why not be what I want to be?&quot;<br />
To his great relief, Claire smiled and nodded.<br />
&quot;I-I've really tried to never be arrogant about looking like . . this to-to never put anyone down in the slightest way for how they look&quot;<br />
Claire squeezed his little shoulders tight and laughed.  &quot;I noticed.  Here was this positively delicious boy who didn't act anything like a pretty boy.  You were so kind and you had no idea who was having a party and who you should be seen with.  You really cared about what I thought about Brave New World and Isak Dinesen and George Eliot.  You were the first boy who cared about my brain except as a reference point about a foot above my breasts&quot;<br />
She patted Tony's head and, inspired by the sight of his boy sized abs, started tickling him.  Tony laughed hysterically and begged her to stop but she wouldn't.  He was completely ticklish, unable to stop giggling and unable to fend her off.<br />
&quot;Please . . hahahahahahahahaha . . please . . hahahahahahahahahaha . . stop . .hahahahahahahahahahaha&quot;<br />
She reduced him to a flailing, wriggling rag doll of a boy in the middle of the bed.  Finally, she relented and kissed him on the lips.  Tony wrapped his arms around her and rolled to be atop her.  He gave her an enthusiastic kiss but then pulled away.<br />
&quot;If I wasn't like this&quot; he sighed.  &quot;You-you don't know what a revelation you were for me.  An exquisite girl who wants to talk about books and symphonies and ideas?  An exquisite girl who liked me because I care about these things and not for-for how I look . . &quot; He bent and kissed her again.<br />
<br />
They spent a minute looking into each other's eyes kissed softly and then got up.  &quot;Let's try Jeff&quot; suggested Tony.  &quot;He knows more about computers than me&quot;.  But Jeff wasn't home when they called.  What's more, his mother said he wouldn't be back for four days.  He was off on a camping trip.  Claire hung up with a shrug.  &quot;I'm sorry for turning you into a 10 year old&quot;<br />
&quot;It's okay.  I-I guess I should make the best of it&quot;<br />
&quot;You still have just the greatest pair of buns in the world&quot; laughed Claire running both hands up the curves of his drum tight rear.  Tony jumped forward. &quot;Jeez . . Mom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
&quot;You've gotta pretend to be my mother, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire agreed that that was how they'd have to play it.  She went to the store next to the health club and came back with the only thing they had there that would fit Tony, a black speedo racing suit.  Tony didn't mind.  He pulled it on and ehld his &quot;mother&quot;'s hand as she led him to the olympic sized pool.  There, in front of a few score parents and as many kids, she slathered sunscreen all over Tony's body and told him to play while she went to buy clothes for him.  She took a cab to the mall and bought Tony a few outfits of shorts, polo shirt, khaki's, polo shirt, jeans, a t-shirt, underwear, socks and sneakers.  Tony had a ball swimming and playing with other kids.  A few kids snickered at his buns splitting speedo but Tony just ignored them.  The time flew till Claire returned.  She had opted for the constant wearing of a hat and sunglasses to hide her 16 year old face as it would seem pretty odd for such a girl to have a 10 year old boy.  <br />
<br />
She got into her role quite a bit that day and that week.  She knew Tony had really never received any mothering and encouragement so she resolved to be perfectly supportive of her boy and she was.  She hugged him frequently and patted his round little ass as often as she thought was acceptable.  She took Tony to Disney World and Busch Gardens Tampa.  She gave him four days that any boy would remember the rest of his life.  <br />
<br />
On the fifth day, they got hold of Jeff.  He didn't recognize Tony's high pitched 10 year old boy's voice but after a laugh at the description of the problem, he talked Tony all the way through removing every bit of spyware from the machine.  At last, he pulled off his 10 year old boy's jeans, t-shirt and little briefs and stood in front of the emitter.  Claire hit 'enter' and he felt the familiar electric wave pass through his little body.  Immediately, he started growing like a time lapse photo of a weed.  His sprouted upward and his shoulders widened.  Muscles blossomed all over him and he returned to the V shaped physique with narrow waist and hips and extramuscular buns, calves and shoulders.  His penis grew to its full regal dimension and his full round seedmaker was suspended behind it.  His face and jaw were their mature shape and his voice was its normal bass pitch.  <br />
<br />
Tony immediately took her and carried Claire to the bed.  For the next two days, they did little but make love, every bit of athleticism mixing with the deepest affection.  And to their great relief and joy, they discovered that they were perfectly matched sexually, Tony being dominant but not so much as to ever deny her anything she wanted.  He loved laying back and having her mount him.  He loved licking her clit and driving her over the edge into ecstasy.  If not for noticing the changes in light outside the windows, they would have had no conception of time, just occasionally sleeping together, spooning somewhere on the bed and waking to each other's kisses and stroking.  <br />
<br />
There was nothing separating their hearts in any way.  So, it wasn't surprising that they forgot to leave the resort complex on time.  It was some time mid Sunday morning when they remembered that they had intended to leave in the wee hours of Sunday morning.  They frantically packed their bags and ran out to the secluded area of the parking lot.  Once there, Tony pulled his clothes off, without even looking to see if anyone could see him.  He made sure Claire had the process right and then took a few steps back.  He nodded to Claire and she typed a few more keys, then 'enter'.  He felt the electric wave pass through him and then his body enlarging and becoming heavy and metallic.  He felt his body dividing into thousands of discrete auto parts, cylinders and pushrods, shock absorbers, brakes, a muffler and a tailpipe.<br />
<br />
Claire watched Tony fall forward onto all fours and his face widen dramatically and his eyes become headlights, his mouth and nose become the car's grill, his lips its front bumper, his buns its rear bumper and his anus the tailpipe.  The changes accelerated and exactly what part of Tony became what part of the 1964 Ford AC Cobra with the 427 side oiler engine couldn't be determined.  All that was certain is that that's what Tony was.  Clair patted the rear bumper and the car horn beeped.  She laughed and tossed her bags inside.  A few minutes later, she roared out of the complex and a few minutes after that she was on the highway.  Just as in bed, she drove her boyfriend part of the time, but let Tony drive most of the time.  He went so fast that they made it home only a little later than they'd intended.  She pulled Tony into her family's garage and changed him back there.  They made love again.  Caroline loved that new car smell he had all over him.</p>
