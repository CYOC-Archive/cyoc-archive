<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie smiled as she strolled the hallways of school. The weekend had been quite enjoyable as her, Ann, and Jackie bonded. The girls enjoyed their time at the beach with Penelope and Heather before returning Penelope to her original age. After that the girls had a relatively quiet weekend meeting Kellies friends and hanging out. Ann and Jackie both enjoyed themselves, shocked when Katie and Lisa introduced Ann to their aunt, Anna doppelgänger.<br />
<br />
Aunt Ann seemed happy enough to meet the teen Ann (a spell to conceal Ann’s identity helped avoid any unwanted questions). Aunt Ann seemed to like her teenage self a great deal, saying she looked forward to seeing her again soon. After that Ann and Jackie’s weekend was relatively quiet until Ann and Jackie returned to their own timeline. As Kellie now made her way to study hall she smiled, hopefully things would be quiet from now on. <br />
<br />
Entering the classroom Kellie saw Lisa, Jason, and Katie we’ve to her, beckoning her to join them. “Hey guys,” Kellie said happily as she pulled up a chair. “How’s everything.”<br />
<br />
“Decent day so far,” Lisa said nuzzling up to Jason. “Jason had a free period so he’s joining us today with the new kid that just moved here.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know Jason was in the peer mentor program,” Kellie said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Katie answered. “Me and him joined at the start of the year. Kind of how he got to know Lisa.”<br />
<br />
Jason could only shrug as he placed an arm around the auburn haired teen. “Hey I wanted to do something good,” she smiled. “Getting to know Lisa was just a bonus.”<br />
<br />
“So that’s what I am,” Lisa smirked. “A bonus.” Jason paled slightly as he now tried to explain himself causing Lisa to laugh. “Relax Jason just messing with you,” she giggled. “Now where’s this new kid? A couple of the girls were telling me he’s kind of cute.”<br />
<br />
“Right there,” Jason stated, pointing to a honey haired boy entering the class. Kellie turned to gaze at the boy and immediately felt the color drain from her face. “It can’t be,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kel,” Jack smirked. “It’s been awhile.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Lisa looked curiously at Kellie before turning towards Jack. “Wait you know her,” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
“We were an item,” Jack said smugly as he gazed at the stricken girl. “Was hoping we could talk Kellie. It’s kind of important.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck off Jack,” Kellie spat as she now shot to her feet and glared at him. “We have nothing to talk about. Especially here.”<br />
<br />
“I think this is the perfect place to talk Ms. O’Toole,” he said, his voice dripping with venom. “After all, we don’t exactly fit in now do we.”<br />
<br />
“Kellie what’s he talking about,” Jason asked. “And I thought your last name was O’Toole. What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
As Kellie was about to answer she saw Jack wave his hand, as he did she noticed that everyone besides herself, Katie and Lisa were now frozen in time. Kellie turned towards her former lover, readying herself for whatever happened. “He’s a Wizard,” Lisa exclaimed, her jaw dropping. “Warlock actually,” Jack corrected. “And I need to talk with Kellie here about our daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Stay the fuck away from Katie,” Kellie screamed, causing the room to shake from her power. Katie and Lisa look d anxiously between the two, worried what was about to happen. “Kellie,” Katie asked, a mixture of fear and curiousity ringing her voice. “What in the hell is going on? Who is this guy?”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she now rubbed her eyes, This was impossible, how did her former lover, Katie’s father, end up here. When Kellie had erased herself from the timeline Jack should of had no memory of ever being with Kellie. Even looking at the handsome teen now she grit her teeth. Kellies own discomfort with her sexuality had led to her having an affair with Jack, resulting in Kellies birth. She had thought she was in love with the handsome, successful lawyer before she finally accepted she was gay. She had broken it off with Jack, making the man incredibly angry. Jack had threatened to take custody of Katie, until Kellie blackmailed him by saying she would expose the affair to his wife. Not wanting to get divorced Jack conceded in the fight, leaving Kellie in her care. Now though, it appeared Jack had changed his mind.<br />
<br />
“How did you get here Mr. Martin,” Kellie grumbled, still glaring at her former lover. “Same way you did Kellie,” Jack smirked. “Erasing someone from existence. No one told me that doing something like that with magic would get you kicked out of your timeline, but it has its advantages. By the way, why so formal? I mean we were REALLY good together.”<br />
<br />
“Wait Kellie was with you,” Lisa asked dumbstruck. “But she’s gay.”<br />
<br />
“Well now she is,” Jack answered. “Let’s just say she was still trying to figure things out when we met, Know I left her very satisfied.”<br />
<br />
“Your a pig Jack,” Kellie grumbled. “See that hasn’t changed. Now where did you learn to use magic?”<br />
<br />
“My mom of course,” Jack said non chalantly. “Grandma and Aunt Circe gave me some lessons too but it was mostly mom. I must say Lilith has been one hell of a teacher.” Kellie gazed curiously at the handsome honey haired teen as he smiled menacingly at her. “What,” he grinned. “Did you think your pops was the only one to claim a mortal as their own? Think again. Lilith rescued me and raised me as her own. She’s real pissed you old man tipped the scales like she did, taking out Morgan like that really pissed her off.”<br />
<br />
Kellie could feel herself breaking into a cold sweat as she stared at Jack. “Leave Merlin out of this,” she whispered. “I’ll kill you Jack if you hurt him, or Katie.”<br />
<br />
“You misunderstood Kellie,” he said quickly. “Lilith and me aren’t here to hurt you or Merlin. We’re here to balance the scales once again. The world needs darkness and I guess I’m it. I’m going to do exactly what you have done, Well the exact opposite really. You bring light to the world, I bring the dark. It’s a crap job but someone has to do it. Now, what I really want though is to see my daughter.”<br />
<br />
“No chance,” Kellie spat. “Your not touching her ever.”<br />
<br />
Jack sighed in annoyance , taking a deep breath he now glared angrily at Kellie. “Listen Kellie and Listen well,” he growled. “You took her from me. I don’t want to hurt you, hell I want to get to know you and your friends were both basically needed to keep the world from devolving into chaos. But, if you try and stop me I will hurt you and the ones you care about.”<br />
<br />
Kellie grit her teeth as Lisa and Katie now stood, standing in between Jack and Kellie. “You need to leave,” Lisa growled. “Now.”<br />
<br />
“You can’t be serious,” Jack scoffed. “Seriously, Kellie maybe has a shot of taking me down but not you two.”<br />
<br />
“We took down Morgan LeFay,” Katie said. “Pretty’s sure we can take down you too.”<br />
<br />
Jack grinned as he looked at the two teens standing in front of his former lover. He knew he could take these two down without breaking a sweat but by doing that he would destroy any chance of seeing his daughter again. It would also keep him from possibly having Kellie as a lover once more. Deciding discretion to be the better of valor he raised his arms in the air as he now casually backed up. “Okay,” he whispered. “But think about what I said Kellie. I won’t wait forever and I’m not going anywhere. I’ll see you around.”<br />
<br />
As Jack exited the classroom his spell ended causing everyone to unfreeze. As an aftereffect of his spell it appeared no one was the wiser of what had happened. Kellie sighed heavily as she slumped back in her chair. If Katie’s father was in the picture once more, things were about to get very complicated for everyone in both timelines.</p>
