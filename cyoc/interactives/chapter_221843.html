<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite their agreement their marriage had fallen into a rut, had they spoken to each other after creating each other&#39;s profile, both would have found the similarities, how in tune they still were to the other, interesting, and would have had second thoughts about using the Chronivac. But, neither said a thing to the other after they left Felicity&#39;s office, and instead they headed through the house in silence until Paul entered the bathroom. Shutting the door, he turned on the light, looked into the full-body mirror which covered a large section of one wall, and muttered, &quot;This is crazy. There is no way this will work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside in the hall, his wife headed toward the bedroom they&#39;d shared for a number of years now. Closing the door, she stepped toward the mirror she kept their and gazed at herself. Seeing her normal reflection, she furrowed her brow, turned one way, then another, and wondered how much of the timer had elapsed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly thinking of what they&#39;d do to go back, she almost tore out of the room to go find Paul and ask if they should set a timer for that. But, changing her mind, figuring it could wait, she gave her reflection another look before she turned away. Walking over to the bed, she shucked off the blouse she had on, undid her bra, slipped out of her skirt, pushed off her panties, and depositing it all on the bed, she sat down next to it and idly started to tap her foot.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Paul continued to stare into the mirror, trying to see the first hint of the transformation. After a couple minutes, he undressed, tossed everything but his belt in the hamper, set the belt on the sink, and turned back to the reflective surface. His pale, thin self gazed back at him and he absently ran a hand through his thinning hair. Wondering what it&#39;d be like when he was female, still having second thoughts about it, even though he knew it was too late to change his mind, he shifted in place until his cock and scrotum were tucked between his legs. Having never done anything like it before, he tried to imagine he had nothing out front down there, but found it difficult. Running a hand again through his thinning hair, he stopped midpass, leaned close to the mirror and stared at his head, certain something was different.<br />
<br />
Felicity flopped back onto the bed and groaned not so much in discomfort, but in pleasure. She hadn&#39;t been sure what about her would transform first, as well as she hadn&#39;t counted on it feeling so good as a warmth spread through her abdomen. Settling in the secret area between her legs, she spread them as far as she could as a pressure inside her grew. Feeling it pushing downward, she gasped, reached down, and slipped two fingers over changing vulva. Feeling not the normal slit, she was surprised for a brief second by what she discovered with her questing fingers. The area balloning out whilst her erect clit fused with her urethra and started to stretch out, she moaned as she first twined her fingers around the growing shaft, then shifted to wrapping a hand around the thickening organ. Sliding forward, trying to will herself to stop, she barely managed to stand. Stumbling toward the mirror, her hand, which had doubled in size and taken a slightly callused, harsh sensation, still holding her dick, which was now more developed and out front, Felicity forced herself to look at her reflection and watch the change occur as a way to distract herself from the need, the desire, the work her semi-erect member.<br />
<br />
Hair lightening not just at the roots, but all over, Paul watched as it first grew in to cover the thin areas, took on volume, then lengthened. Passing his shoulders as it become crimped, wavy, had a slight curl to it, he watched as it grew out till it was down to the small of his back. Touching it, finding it soft, luxurious, he stopped when he saw how small, dainty his hands become. Focused on watching as his fingernails grew out, he missed it as his eyes shifted colour, he facial hair shifted to only a thin pair of eyebrows being present, four holes formed in each of his earlobes and his face took on a more feminine countenance.<br />
<br />
It was only when his dick and nuts, still tucked between his legs, twitched, did he stop looking at his hand. Glancing down, spreading his legs, noting his body hair was already greatly reduced, he uttered a moan of both unhappiness and pleasure when his cock and sack didn&#39;t drop, but instead remained where they were. Feeling his nuts pulling up into his body, Paul placed a hand on the mirror and gasped when he felt a general horniness wash over him, settle in the area between his legs, and leave him with a warmth which went down into his now hairless thighs and up into his sensitive chest, as well as a buzzy, tingling sensation throughout the forming vulva and up into his developing vagina. Watching as his hips, butt, and thighs became more pronounced, Paul found it hard not to do so, but wanted desperately to use two finger to stimulate further his already erect clit.<br />
<br />
From where she stood, Felicity watched as her height increased, whilst her hair shortened. Thinking she looked ridiculous, as she still had breasts, a pinched waist, and pronounced butt, thighs and hips, the woman found herself relieved when these things actually started to regress and morph. Watching as her chest flattened out, though not completely, her torse took on a more masculine barrel-look, she ran a meaty hand over her abdomen as it became more chiseled. Muscles forming, weight increasing, Felicity found it harder and harder to consider herself using the female pronouns, and as her feet increased in size whilst the hair on her head settled at a buzzcut, she flexed her burgeoning muscular arms. Hormones shifting as androgens replaced estrogen and progesterone, and he found the more he looked, the more he felt comfortable with the guy he saw looking back as memories of growing up male replaced those of growing up female.<br />
<br />
Breasts developing quicker than she thought, Paul cupped them each with a small dainty hand. Liking how the erect nippled brushed against her soft palm, unaware she&#39;d stopped using male pronouns to describe herself, she soon forgot to address herself by her former male name as her memories became those of someone who&#39;d been born a girl, grew up as one, transitioned through those awkward teenage years to become the younger woman standing in front of the mirror. Her age the last to change, much as it was for her former wife, now boyfriend, Aimee stepped back and leaned against the wall. Raising a leg and exposing her vulva, she stared at the puffy, full genitals, having a hard believing at one time she&#39;d had a cock. Then the thought left her and she wondered for a split second what she was doing naked in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
New memories formed and she suddenly recalled why it was she&#39;d come in. Turning away from the mirror, she stepped to the walk-in shower and turned it on. Waiting for the water to warm up, she took from the closet a body towel, hand towel, and washclothe. Setting them on the sink, Aimee stepped into the shower and under the water, where she remained for a bit as she let the warm water cascade over her body, massaging the soft skin, and feeling great in certain areas.<br />
<br />
Owen, hearing the shower turn up, turned away from the mirror. Oblivious to how reality was re-writing itself, the house he and Aimee had owned when they&#39;d been Paul and Felicity changing to an apartment, he stepped away from the reflective device and toward a door which had appeared in the wall. Opening it, knowing it led into the bathroom, he stepped into the small room and across toward the shower. Opening the door, seeing Aimee standing under the water, eyes closed, head thrown back, a look of rapture on her face, Owen stepped in behind the  five-foot tall woman. Wrapping his arms around her, her breasts resting on his forearms, he nuzzled her neck and gave her a kiss before he said, &quot;Morning, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chronivac forgotten for the moment, the woman opened her eyes, turned her head to give the man a quick kiss and returned his greeting. The former married college stood for a moment longer underneath the pulse of water, content to hold each other, before Owen inquired what Aimee had going for the day. Reaching for her body wash, the woman started to explain as she lathered her front, and handing the bottle to her boyfriend, relishing the feel as Owen rubbed the body wash over her back, she inquired what he had planned.</p>
