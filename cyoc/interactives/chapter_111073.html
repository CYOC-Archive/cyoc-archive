<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sophia had an issue with money, especially since she just came out of college. She tried to work jobs, but most were either take or out of her experience. That is until one day, the newspaper had an interesting job offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lab assistant: Help test new chemical solutions.... blah blah blah... WOAH... &#39;Pays up to $100,000 a day!&#39; ? &#39;No experience required!&#39; ? I&#39;m sold!&quot; Sophia said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Sophia had the build of an average woman; Not too thin, not too muscular, and not too fat. Her hair had a dark brown tone to it and was tied into a ponytail. She sat at her table drinking her morning coffee and skimmed through the details of the contracting.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;If agreed upon all rules, any acts against your body will become legal ya-dah-ya-dah-ya-dah...&#39; . Anything is probably better than what&#39;s going in my life right now,&quot; she said glancing around her basically empty house. Her parents had mysteriously gone missing when she was given their will, she had to use it all on textbooks and basic needs so now she was stuck with basically in debt and she barely knew anyone to loan her. And anyone she did was struggling with money too, so that was out of the question too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to make the call I guess,&quot; Sophia said shrugging while dialing the number.<br />
<br />
It was immediately picked up by a woman, who greeted her with a bubbly voice,&quot;Hello! This BioTech Inc. ! Who am I speaking to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my name is Sophia and I was calling in for a job interview. I was saw an ad on the newspaper and this is it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! You are our 1st caller so congrats! And for the job interview, there is none. As said, anyone can be accept. All I need for you is to give me your email so I can send you further instructions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then.&quot; Sophia said her email and hoped that they could be trusted.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later the woman said,&quot;Done! You can now hang up and if you have any further questions just email it to me! Have a nice day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; Sophia responded refreshing her email page. Sure enough there it was, the email. She skimmed through the introduction and the rules looking for anything important. There was a link that lead to their private website where they sold a single item, which was a rubber one piece swimsuit that had long sleeves. The instructions said to buy it then wait a day. She shrugged, bought it, then continued through. It stated that she had to take a shower then as soon as possible put on the suit. The rest just stated more legal stuff, location, and the time.<br />
<br />
Sophia thought about her decision for a bit then decided whether she should go or not. &quot;Do I really want to sacrifice my body for science? I mean what if I die or I-&quot; she said before she got a notification from her bank account. It stated she had been given $150,000, which was enough to get the debt repaid to more than 3/4. The thought of doubt instantly as she danced happily around the room. &quot;Fuck that, I&#39;m going to get rich!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was the next morning and Sophia was in the bathroom getting ready until she heard a knock on the door. She quickly spit out the toothpaste water and ran downstairs. She opened the door and looked around, only to find a neat, light gray package at her footsteps. Carefully peeling of the tape, she opened the box and there it was; the suit. She ran upstairs to take the shower, taking the suit in it with her. When she was done, her instructions stated that she had to immediately put on the suit, no drying or stepping out of the shower even. She climbed into the stretchy clothing and felt her body cling tightly to the material. Suddenly, her body felt cleaner and more refreshed along with the fact that her body was totally dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, this is some crazy science shit,&quot; Sophia said inspecting her body. On her left arm, in black bold army print, it said &quot;#1&quot; and her stomach was a big black band that went around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is one high quality &#39;test&#39; suit. And pretty sexy too,&quot; she thought grabbing her keys and heading into her car.<br />
<br />
The took about an hour and went to, logically, a very unfamiliar place. For such a large building, they managed to hide it quite well, as Sophia could only see it when she was within a few hundred feet away. There was an area for parking cars, which had only had 13 spots, in which 2 were taken. She parked her car and went in, walking in a pair of pure white rubber slip-ons that came with the suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s hope this trip was worth it,&quot; Sophia thought nervously as she reached the doors.<br />
<br />
The doors were made of pure steel, looking similar to school doors. She pulled them open and was greeted to somewhat dark feeling. The atmosphere inside the place was reminiscent of a hospital but with a more melancholy feeling to it. The walls were a dark gray, only bordered by a slightly lighter shade. There was a sofa and 2 sofa chairs that matched them with a pure gray block that sat in the middle of it. In front of Sophia was a counter which had a receptionist, the same one she called. Her face seemed around 30 years old, blonde hair, green eyes, and wore a gray work suit. It took Sophia a nervous hello up to the counter for her to look up from her computer. To the right of her was dimly lit hallway leading to who knows what.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you came! I was worried you wouldn&#39;t!&quot; she said, as happy as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do need the money,&quot; joked Sophia with a sheepish laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough. Hey, I don&#39;t think I introduced my name to you yet. Just call me Patricia,&quot; she said smiling. &quot;Anyways, the tests will be conducted downstairs, so if you would be so kind to follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, but is there anything that can kill me here?&quot; Sophia asked worryingly as she followed Patricia downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, everything here is 100% safe! However if you do managed to die, which is nearly impossible, we will give the rest of your family your earnings tripled!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I can still die...&quot; Sophia thought.<br />
<br />
It took 5 minutes but they were finally at a long hallway with a few doors. Patricia and Sophia walked into the on that was the farthest away. The room was ginormous, as big as a plane hangar. There was a phew bits and bobs of machinery scattered around but most of the place was empty. Sophia was told to stand right in the middle of it all and wait. Patricia quickly walked out of the room and headed into the nearby room, which lead to a control center with 3 other scientists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, as you can see the participant is in position. What test do we give her?&quot; Patricia said to the middle aged man. He was tall and somewhat lean. His hair had noticeable amounts of gray and tired eyes.<br />
<br />
He looked at a list of options he had and pointed at certain topic. &quot;Let&#39;s go with option...&quot;</p>
