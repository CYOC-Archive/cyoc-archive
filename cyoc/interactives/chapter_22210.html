<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he towled himself dry, Charlie smiled cockily at his attractive reflection in the locker-room mirror. He was a handsome enough fucker in clothes, but Charlie thought he was the most impressive like this, in his full glory, completely naked, his flaccid nine incher dangling impressively between imposing thighs. His magnificent muscles, large tight and cut, flexed and vibrated as he moved the towel over his body and his tanned clear skin shimmered, still slightly damp from the shower. He reached a meaty sized hand up to his strong handsome jaw. Stroking it slowly and feeling it’s strength and magnificence, as he studied his beautiful face. Beautiful was the word. His body was perfect and muscular, but he wasn’t just any bulked-up meathead or steroid-freak. His perfect, prominent features and beautiful clear blue eyes seemed to hint at a sensitivity, and deepness, an intense intelligent and understanding, all radiating from his beauty. It was all a lie of course. Sensitive, intelligent and deep –they were all just labels you’d give a ‘queer’. With the rest of his jock buddies, Charlie prided himself on his masculinity, his virility and his aggression. Football, fucking, fun was his life and it’s the way he liked it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He thought back to another time, not so long ago, when things were very different. He’d hide himself away in the library all day to get away from guys like him. Charles wasn’t beautiful, muscular, streetwise or popular – he didn’t really have any friends, apart from Jamie of course. He was weak and agitated, overweight and drastically under-sexed little nerd. The kind of guy Charlie sneered at now, if he gave him a second thought at all. As he fingered the class ring on a bulging finger, Charlie’s thoughts reached an unusually high level of introversion and contemplation. In a second, Charlie felt the fear and unhappiness of that solitary figure. He didn’t really deserve any of that shit he got, he was basically just a nice guy – he had to be, he couldn’t afford any of the masculine arrogance that Charlie now exuded. As he took another admiring glance at his reflected face, he looked hard. There were similarities definitely. Charlie kind of came across as the much better looking older brother of the little nerd he had developed from. Perhaps it was possible still to see some of the old Charlie within. Beyond the arrogance, the hardness, the masculinity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe he could have done this without the pills? No chance. What those pills did was more than a few simple workouts and dietary advice. They were magical. Literally everything about Charlie’s body, and mind, had been transformed. He was taller, more muscular, bulkier. He even smelt different, better. Charlie wouldn’t be anywhere or anyone without those pills. He must have taken over thirty of those little fuckers. The packet had been full then, now it was empty. In the end, the pills didn’t even seem to change anything anymore - the truth was there didn't seem to be anything else that needed changing. He'd reach optimum levels of fitness. But he kept on taking them anyway. Every week, every Monday morning at 8, as regular as clockwork. He didn’t know that if he stopped it, he might change back, the changes might start reversing – that was a thought just to scary for words. And so he carried on until there was only one left. He could have just taken that too, but something stopped him. Something small and puny and weak and frightened. Jamie would never get anywhere near the impressive levels that Charlie had, through one pill; he’d never come close to rivalling his friend’s status as star player on the football field. Those pillsdidn’t just bring on a second puberty. They had to fight against the body as well – undo the changes of a previous adolescence. But it would have made a difference nevertheless. Changed something and given him a bit more hope, maybe even a girlfriend. It was Charles that had made him do it. Fuck Charles, he’s all gone now. Charlie took another admiring glance at his reflection. Perfect smile, perfect teeth, perfect skin, perfect face, perfect body. All perfect. Except wasn’t that a little spot, just above his lip?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Charlie…?” He’d recognise that voice anywhere. As it echoed around the locker-room, Charlie turned his head in Carrie’s direction, standing in the doorway. His body still rooted to the spot, facing it’s own reflection. He brought a hand up to his lips and as his arm moved, the massive bicep flexed impressively. Something was up with Carrie. She hadn’t rung him all weekend, and when he’d eventually rung her – she’d seemed different. More distant, and she hadn’t been very keen to come over. Charlie thought that maybe Jayne had told her about what they’d got up to Friday lunchtime. No that couldn’t be it, Carrie had known all about him and other girls. She’d come back to him, no matter what. And Charlie liked the stability and standing of a long-term girlfriend. One who was hot and beautiful and popular, and would let him fuck any other girls he wanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Sup baby. I’m getting so fucking horny standing here, waiting for you. Come over and give me a service.”<br />
<br />
“Getting horny looking at your own reflection? Figures”<br />
<br />
“What the fuck’s that supposed to mean?”<br />
”Work it out.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something was definitely up with her. But Charlie wasn’t on hanging around to find out what. Without a shrug, he turned away from her – swaggering over to his clothes and possessions. He was getting sick of Carrie’s moods anyway. She turned him on like crazy, but so did the rest of the cheerleading squad, and the rest of them weren’t loaded with questions and arguments and depth. She was his first girlfriend and it had been a few months. Perhaps it was time he ‘moved on’.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”<br />
”Towling off.”<br />
<br />
“Charlie, I need to talk to you.<br />
<br />
“Talk”<br />
<br />
“Stop doing that, listen to me.”<br />
<br />
”You want me to stay naked?” He smirked. Carrie liked to pretend she was better than any other girl, but she was exactly the same. He could always make her horny and begging and submissive.<br />
<br />
“No, I want you too….I…”<br />
”Spit it out Carrie. Christ, what the fuck is the matter with you?”<br />
”I need to tell you that…. it’s over. Me and you. Starting from now”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Charlie dropped the towel.</p>
