<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four lions shared a glance among each other as they considered Kim’s offer, in the wild if they were mindless animals a jaguar living among lions was unthinkable. Besides the fact that they lived on different continents and in different environments there wasn’t any examples of mixed prides however they were not animals. They retrained some of their human mind and they knew that having a mixture of skills would aid in their pride surviving and a jaguar had different skills then a lion. She seemed more graceful, more stealth and if she was like her animal like counterparts she just as deadly as a lion. She however lacked the raw strength of a lion and she knew that in a straight fight she needed the strength. So a partnership was in everyone’s interest. She seamed of age with the rest of them, maybe a year younger then the others if that, but since all of them where in their mid-twenties the youngest she could be was 22 more likely 23 or 24.<br />
There was also the fact that Kim was downright attractive, she was thinner and any of the lions with a taller and more graceful form but with a good size rack with two other smaller sets of breasts under the larger one like all big cats. Her tail was longer and fuller in nature and her deep red fur with the black jaguar spots with deep green eyes made her very good looking. Constance and Barbara where already thinking about what they wanted to do with his new feline and Aaron had his own ideas. Lindsay while not objectionable to sleeping with females now that transformation had happened didn’t like the idea of sharing Aaron with anyone besides Constance and Barbara but that more because they had just met this Kim. <br />
“The more the better I say.” Said Constance as everyone nodded their heads as they headed away from the chaos they had helped made. Already the infected was spreading rapidly as the entire small town and the surrounding refugee camp began to turn. <br />
“Where are we going?” inquired Kim as Barbara took the lead, she didn’t even notice that she began to move on all four legs with ease, they had to stay low however she did stand up from time to time to make sure she was heading the right way.<br />
“My cousin’s place…it will make great hunting ground and I hope is there.” stated Barbara <br />
“I see.” Stated Kim as they moved forward through the woods the sound of gunfire disappearing as they headed away from the battle. <br />
“So Kim…how where you transformed?” inquired Constance <br />
“Well…It happened to me at work.” Started Kim<br />
<br />
Flashback<br />
<br />
“Kim, you have a special request customer.” Said the bartender as Kim leaned over the bar and placed the money on the table. Her corset was riding up again and she had to change her bikini bottom she knew that, on top of that her high heels where killing her feet again. <br />
“Does it have to be me, Mike?” Complained Kim as the announcer called the next “performer” to the stage to do her act. “I just finished a lap dance and I swear the guy must have ejaculated a few times in his pants. It leaked through and got on me damn it.”<br />
“Well he is offering $500 extra for a red head…I could call…” started Mike as Kim raised her hand.<br />
“I’ll take the $500, wet bottom or not.” stated Kim as she prepared herself for what that men had paid for in a special performance. Was it legal what she was about to do, no but she needed the money.<br />
“Room 2.” explained Mike as Kim walked into room 2 swaying her hips in a way that had gotten her kicked out of all those church schools her parents had sent her to when she was with them. She saw the man, he looked shaken up a bit, with broken glasses and a jittery body. Great a druggy, she hated them but that $500 would take a chunk out of her rent and help her. She walked forward and leaned down to show him her breasts all bunch up and bursting out the top of her corset. <br />
“Hello there…I am Kimberly…how can I help you?” said Kim licking her lips.<br />
The man said nothing, instead he undid his zipper and pulled out his junk. Kim hid her eye roll at the size while putting on a smile, men liked to think they had the biggest junk in town when they didn’t. She knew what he wanted and got down on her knees as he spread his legs. She took him in her mouth and began to work him. She wasn’t paying attention to this man, just focused on getting the job done right so she could earn the money maybe with some extra. Her first hint that something was wrong was when he just kept growing…he grew and grew in her mouth. Finally with a tremor he sent his seed out and she backed out, the taste was strange and she wanted to gag at it but that would cost her money. She looked up to see the man had transformed and a beast was before her…a cat like creature. She screamed as she pulled away but he grabbed her, she twisted free and stumbled against the wall. <br />
The creature growled as her scream brought more people into the room, believing she was being assaulted. What they saw was unbelievable as this jaguar man began to attack those who where coming into the room. Kim ran out of the room, not noticing that her corset was ripping apart as she began to transform. She stumbled into the dressing room, breathing heavily as the changes began to take hold. As she did her mind began to focus, she needed to find a mate and none of these men where worthy of her, none would give her what she wanted. She moved outside just as sirens  began to fill the air, little did she know she was among the 1st infected and transformed and with each step fur began to climb up her body, her cloths falling away as she became more and more animal like. Around her she noticed more animal people, not just jaguars like her but different animals coming from a university building down the road. That didn’t matter anymore she had work to do and a mate worthy of her to find.<br />
<br />
End Flashback<br />
<br />
“I was later shot in the head by a tear gas canister and it knocked me out and I was taken for study.” Stated Kim as she explained what happened to her. “How about you?”<br />
“I slipped and landed on some cum and started to transform and went to get the love of my life.” Said Barbara as she placed a hand on Constance.<br />
“Once that is done we went to get our friends to make a pride.” Added Constance<br />
“And we are all the better for it.” Stated Lindsay <br />
“We are getting close.” Announced Barbara as they came toward a clearing in the woods, they could see a rather nice looking cabin located near a large lake with woods on three sides. A gravel driveway led toward the road and a large barn sat on the other side of the cabin. The cabin itself was two stories tall but Barbara knew there was a finished basement. The cabin had a wrap around covered porch with a couple of chairs outside. The lights where on in the kitchen area.<br />
“Any idea who is home?” inquired Aaron<br />
“My cousin for sure but no idea who else if anyone.” Stated Barbara noticing her cousin’s jeep by the house. “So what do you want to do?”</p>
