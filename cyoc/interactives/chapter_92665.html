<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave glanced up as his door opened.  Jenny just managed not to slam it shut behind her as she stalked over to his desk.  Her skirt had either split, or she&#39;d altered it herself. Two narrow swaths of white cloth, held together on her hips by binder clips, hung before and behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Bahner, let&#39;s get one thing straight.  I am going to sue this company, Joe Cathcart, that fucking cunt in HR, that smart-ass secretary, and I will take you down with them if you so much as leer at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny slammed the water bottle onto Dave&#39;s desk and glared at him.<br />
<br />
Dave picked up his copy of Jenny&#39;s dress code.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you say that was a &#39;conversational tone of voice and volume appropriate to a workplace setting&#39;?&quot; Dave asked mildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can take that list and shove it up your ass! That sexist patriarchal sack of shit Cathcart...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave stopped listening as Jenny continued cursing and ranting at him.  Instead he regarded her using his lust vision.  Over-all she was a deep blue color with black streaks flowing from her head to her limbs.  As she began pacing and gesturing Dave noticed the streaks flared in time with her violent motions. As an experiment he tried &quot;heating up&quot; Jenny&#39;s tits and crotch.  He expected them to become greenish before passing to yellow, and then to red.  Instead they deepened to a dark purple.  Unsure what that meant Dave instead tried to reduce the black streaks.  At first he thought it was working, Jenny had stopped pacing and flailing at the air as she talked, then he realized the streaks were all being drawn to her loins.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not even listening.&quot; Jenny said dully. &quot;You couldn&#39;t care less what happens to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I?&quot; Dave surprised himself by asking. &quot;You treat people like shit, picked this ridiculous farce instead of just letting them fire you, and thanks to that instead of an assistant who&#39;ll help me with my work I&#39;m stuck with a cast iron bitch who doesn&#39;t know when to give something up!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave stood up as he spoke and walked to stand nose to nose with the angry woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want a wrongful termination suit?  Good fucking luck!  For violating the volume and tone of voice portions of your dress code I revoke your ability to wear skirts in my office.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave grabbed the skimpy white cloth and tugged sending the binder clips tinkling as they tumbled to the floor.<br />
<br />
For a moment Jenny stared at him in shock, her jaw hanging open, body bare from her breasts to her feet.  Then her body flashed white-hot to Dave&#39;s vision and she was pressing herself against him in a passionate kiss.  Dave fell backward, Jenny landing on top of him grinding her tits and crotch against his body.  Dave allowed himself to become erect and Jenny began enthusiastically dry humping him as they continued kissing, Jenny&#39;s tongue questing warm and sweet in Dave&#39;s mouth.  Dave fumbled his pants off and Jenny wasted no time sliding herself onto his cock.  She was sobbing and panting and still grinding her breasts against him as she pistoned herself on his shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;...you-ugh. Hate you-ugh. Hate you-ugh. Hate you...&quot; She chanted as she rode his erection.  Dave could still see the black streaks curling from her crotch and tits to her brain.  Dave drew a couple to her mouth and Jenny abruptly bit him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Dave yelled, pushing her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on stud, what&#39;s a little pleasure without some pain?&quot;  Jenny panted in a sultry voice.<br />
<br />
Dave clamped down on the streaks, forcing them all down into Jenny&#39;s crotch as he sat up.  Jenny&#39;s eyes went blank as she began bobbing rapidly up and down. Dave heard a click as his door opened a couple inches and he saw Jodie looking in at them.  He flashed her a thumbs up and pressed some sparkles into her.  Dave caught a glimpse of a quick smile as she softly closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me Daddy fuck me Daddy fuck me Daddy...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny was getting louder as she neared orgasm.  Dave pulled her in for a kiss, careful to keep her violent impulses centered on her loins.  Their kiss muffled Jenny&#39;s screams as she came.  She fell back limply, her body shifting from purple to a deep red. There were still some black streaks in her, but also some white sparkles, mainly around her nipples.  Somehow in all their violent sex Jenny had managed to keep her top on, such as it was.<br />
<br />
Dave pulled her upright and eased her tits out of her top, lapping gently at her nipples and gently sucking on them.  Her sparkles flared and she began stroking his hair, muttering endearments as if he were a pet.  After a while Dave positioned Jenny on her back.  She offered no resistance, but also didn&#39;t seem fully aware of her surroundings.  Dave paused, wondering if perhaps he&#39;d injured her mind somehow, and her color shifted back towards purple, this time with the black streaks centered on her wrists.  Dave was shocked to see faint white scars showing against her flushed skin.  He resumed nuzzling her tits and her color faded back to red. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, naughty puppy, no licking Jenny there, bad puppy...&quot; despite her words Jenny held Dave&#39;s face firmly against her soft breasts stimulating her nipples.<br />
<br />
Dave pressed to increase Jenny&#39;s sparkles, bringing her to orgasm several times.  The black streaks were less apparent afterwards, and Jenny seemed more lucid, eventually becoming an active participant in their sex.<br />
<br />
Eventually, hours later, they lay together on the floor of Dave&#39;s office, the setting sun painting Jenny&#39;s flesh golden.  To Dave&#39;s vision she ranged from yellow to deep red, her body sparkling wherever he touched her.  She stroked his penis, gently fingering the shaft he&#39;d allowed to go semi-limp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  She said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Dave purred as he traced her ribs with his fingertips.  &quot;Thank you!  That was indescribable sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not for the sex!  Well, for that too.&quot;  She let go of his penis and put her hand on Dave&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid what would have happened...what I&#39;d have done if you hadn&#39;t--&quot;  Tears willed in her blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Dave kissed her gently, wiping the tears away as they rolled down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were pretty emotional, I&#39;m glad we found a constructive way to release that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, let me say this!&quot;  Jenny took a deep breath.  &quot;I&#39;m not...good with intimacy, had some bad experiences...I can&#39;t open up to men.  Can&#39;t trust them.  In my head, sex and violence are all twisted together--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father molested you.&quot;  Dave guessed.  The shower of tears and sobs confirmed it and punctuated the story Jenny told him afterwards.  How her feelings of shame and guilt lead to suicidal impulses.  She&#39;d chased after brutish alpha jocks she could threaten her father with to keep him away, letting them use her for sex in exchange.  Trading her body for security in high school transitioned to trading her body for advantages in college.  She&#39;d alienated the women in her dorm, and developed a reputation with the men on campus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I graduated I promised myself I&#39;d never have sex again.  It felt meaningless, you know?  I guess maybe that was the only kind of sex I understood.  But you, you spent more time today pleasuring me than yourself!  You figured out what I liked and kept doing it, and, God, I&#39;ve always had to fight just to, to take what pleasure I could while guys used me like a piece of meat, and you were so sweet, even after I bit you for fuck&#39;s sake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d better get that looked at.&quot; Dave said as he kissed her again, feeling Jenny&#39;s body rise to meet him, her tongue slipping into his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I don&#39;t want to stop.&quot; Jenny said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the cleaning crew will be in eventually.&quot;  Dave looked at the blushing woman in his arms. &quot;Would you like to come back to my place?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nestled her forehead against his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want me to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave tipped her head back to look her in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;If /you/ want to.  I&#39;m not going to force myself on you, or demand you have sex with me.  I&#39;d be happy to make love /with/ you, if you want, but if you need time to get your head together I want to give you the time you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you.  I want to do what we did this afternoon every day! I want you to be my puppy and lick my tits, and--&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave let her cry as he held her gently.</p>
