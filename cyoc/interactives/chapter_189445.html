<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wonderful, simply marvelous!&quot; Says the witch as she samples some of the nectar. She could feel her strength returning and appeared to grow a tad younger in appearance. Nothing significant, a few days at best, but enough to be proud of still. She had finally found her source of immortality. This plant would be the key figure to the rest of her life, and the center point of her business.<br />
<br />
After watching the witch cast yet another magic spell towards her, Jen felt herself lift out of her pot as her nectar pods (breasts) hung down below her. She was then suddenly moved to a completely diccerent place and set down inside what looked to be a large plant bed in the center of a large, square room. <br />
<br />
She oddly enough, became excited when her roots began burying themselves into the soil, as it was of an extremely high quality. She had to remind herself that she isn&#39;t a plant, and things like dirt quality shouldn&#39;t be making her this happy. <br />
<br />
The witch then appeared right next to her, but with a look of concern and disappointment. She approached Jen and sighed. &quot;Damn it, why did you have to be a  hunan?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen was both puzzled and excited. Someone realized she wasn&#39;t supposed to be a fuckplant! She swayed around happily and flailed her leaves. She then tried speaking, which at first was difficult since her mouth and &quot;tongue&quot; were quite a bit different than her human versions, but she soon got the hang of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know I am a human? That&#39;s great! I-&quot; spoke Jen, but she was silenced by the witch&#39;s finger being pressed up against her lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hush. Just, let me think for a moment.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen nodded and let the witch think in silence. Since she was still full from before, she had no urge to fuck her either. After a minute, the witch jighed loudly again. &quot;Damn, what am I gonna do now?&quot; She mumbled to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Asked Jen. She had watched the witch for the entire time and felt that something big was concerning her, and somehow she was involved too. The witch looked at her, &quot;You. You&#39;re whats wrong. If you were just a normal plant, then things would have been perfect. But your a transformed human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am! I was turned into this disgusting plant with a curse that is passed around in my town. You wouldn&#39;t be able to turn me back to normal, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like I have a whole lot of say in the matter, it is illegal for a witch to keep a transformed human transformed if she finds them abandoned without an owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What an interesting rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it stops us from just kidnapping people and saying we found them, while still keeping them trapped in their tranformed state. Keeps the witch hunts to a minimum. Say, you wouldn&#39;t mind remaining a fuckplant would you?&quot; Asked the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sorry, but I would mind. I want to be human again.&quot; Replied Jen.<br />
<br />
The witch shrugged in response, since she already guessed that it would turn out like this. But then she made a seperate offer. &quot;Ok, then how about we make a deal? You will keep being my fuckplant durring the day. Then you also will become my appearance and I will let you be human again at night while I teach you magic. Sounds good right?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Jen jad to admit it sounded tempting. And it wasn&#39;t like she was all that uncomfortable being a fuckplant either. Her entire body was as sensitive as her clit, so even just a passing breeze felt nice. &quot;Could we do a trial period?&quot; Offered Jen as compromise.<br />
<br />
The wktch readily accepted and waved her hands again. Jen rose out of the dirt bed as her roots twisted around themselves as they turned back into her human legs. Her stem widemed out, becoming her torso, and her nectar pods attached themselves to her chest, and then to the area over her shoulder blades on her back. Her leaves turned back into her arms, though a single, large leaf remained on the backs of both hands which merged into her wrists. Her fingers also lacked nails and were still more vine like than human fingers. Her nipples also were still pussies with vine clits, leaking her golden nectar.<br />
<br />
Her neck reformed beneath her head mouth, which also turned back into her normal head, save for her mouth and lips, which kept their cylindrical tube shape and over inflated/puffy appearance respectively. Her tonge was human again, but now long enough to touch her own forehead, even with her 8 inches or so deeper mouth. She could talk fine through it as well. Her hair was a seperate matter though. What once was long beautiful locks of fine blond hair had been turned completely green, and several large flowers now appeared near her forehead, and worked to keep her hair styled similarly to using hair clips and pins.<br />
<br />
Her human pussy didn&#39;t make its return though, nor did her asshole, seeing as how they were rendered obsolete by her mouth, nipple pussies, and by the fact that she now can gain energy using photosynthesis and not normal food. <br />
<br />
Jen ran her vine-like fingers through her moss covered, green hair. It felt the same as before, just a bit heavier. She examined her leaves on her hands and didn&#39;t mind them staying either. They were sturdier than normal leaves and had quite sharp edges too. They could cut through soft things like fruits very easily. They could also be used to dig, to an extent. She touched her rear facing nectar pods and shuttered from the pleasure they brought her as they still were extremely sensitive. So sensitive that wearing any sort of top would be impossible. And with no need to cover her crotch anymore, Jen realized that clothing was pretty useless to her now.<br />
<br />
Still though, she moved around a bit, pausing only when she stepped infront of a window and let the sun shine on her hair for a few moments. She always liked sunbathing, and now she has a perfect body to do it with.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the witch was making preparations to make Jen her apprentice. After completing and sending the paperwork with magic, she received the permit and called Jen over, who had partially laid down in the sunny spot while being sure not to crush her pods by accident. When Jen heard herself being called over, her body moved on its own by way of her vine nipples and roots acting as  her mobile supports. They carried her over while maintaining her laying down pose as if she were a queen, which at least when it comes to plants, Jen kind of now was in a sense. <br />
<br />
Her body doing this autonomously somewhat startled Jen, but the Witch explained it to her. &quot;You have been accepted as my apprentice, so you have to do what I say when it doesn&#39;t conflict too highly with your morals. Also, you still are not actually a human by the way. If I had to say, you are something similar to like a dryad, or just a mobile version of like, an Alraune maybe? Yeah, that fits you way better. You are currently an Alraune, just one that can move. They are a species of plant girl, and one that mainly consumes semen too. And as you have just figured out, you basically are not only able to control plant life, but they seem to consider you as their queen or something, and will act on your behalf automatically in order to serve you best. So just get use to this kind of treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked herself over once again, and sighed. At least she wasn&#39;t going to be stuck in the ground 24/7 anymore. And she likely will end up in a better spot after all of this too. </p>
