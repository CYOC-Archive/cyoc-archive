<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caroline with a sway of her hips confidently walked through the streets enjoying her form. Nice perky B-cups nestled in a nice push-up bra to give them some nice cleavage to them, a somewhat plump ass, and a slender form. Yep this was just around where she felt the most comfortable on the day to day, and when she&#39;d get pregnant with her lover she&#39;d probably want to be around this amount of femininity. She doubted her lover would mind either. Today was a good day as well. The Sun was shining above a blue sky, she had just gotten to the bakery right after the bread just came out of the oven, and the local cafe&#39;s new item on the &quot;experimental&quot; menu came out delicious. She even found some cute and sexy clothes on discount. <br />
<br />
On her walk through the city she was passing by her old DDD (Dick Duel Dojo) and decided to see if she could observe some of the training and lessons going on as an old Alumni. Going to the front desk there was an old manly man with a magnificent white beard who gave Caroline a grin as he said &quot;Ah Carl, been awhile. How&#39;s life been.&quot; <br />
Caroline chuckled and said &quot;It&#39;s Caroline, life has been good and Gerald has been getting manlier steadily.&quot;<br />
The old master chuckled as well and said &quot;Sorry for misgendering you, but with your skill your more of a man than most of the students here. How much of Gerald&#39;s manliness is even rightfully his?&quot; <br />
&quot;All of it, that was the deal after all&quot; Caroline smirked &quot;I was curious how some of the training is going. Mind if I watched?&quot; <br />
&quot;Watch? For you I&#39;d be grateful if you did a demonstration or two, but watch to your hearts content.&quot; Caroline smiled as she put her bags near some of the cabinets very certain no one would dare steal in front of her old master, but she did keep her purse on her. <br />
<br />
Striding into the first chamber there were a lot of kids who were just starting to really polish their handles. The teacher also seemed new and was teaching some of the fundamentals of the Dick Duels. Breaking down the 3 traditional steps of the Dick Duel. 1. materializing your blade, 2. the fight, and 3. what to do after the fight ends. The teacher noticing Caroline just striding in asked &quot;Excuse me miss, we&#39;re in a lesson.&quot; <br />
Caroline just said &quot;I&#39;m an Alumni and got Ol White Beard&#39;s permission. However I&#39;m shocked you didn&#39;t include the actual first step in a Dick Duel.&quot; <br />
One of the kids raised their hand and then blurted out &quot;What&#39;s the actual first step?&quot; <br />
The teacher shook his head and said &quot;There isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s just blade materialization, fighting, and resolution.&quot; <br />
Caroline however said &quot;It&#39;s kind of part of blade materialization, but it&#39;s sizing up your opponent.&quot; She looked at the Teacher&#39;s crotch which considering he was a Dick Duelist by trade and he was wearing a DD Gi completely exposed his dick much like the other kids. &quot;For instance you could probably eyeball the surface level manliness just by looking at someone&#39;s general body, but there are a lot of other traits to keep in mind. Knowing how much manliness someone can use can give you an edge when constructing your own blade or when deciding to challenge someone at all. Then again this is your class so what&#39;s the lesson of the day? Getting used to Jacking Out?&quot; <br />
The teacher said &quot;Blade Materialization. As a new class it is important that you all start being able to materialize your blade. Get a feel of what putting your manliness into your dick means.&quot; The teacher put his right hand on his penis which hardened on command and then he drew out a reasonably long dick sword. Caroline had to admit this guy was pretty manly to be able to get out a traditionally decent sword and only looking a little feminine... maybe she had A-cups at most? <br />
most of the students didn&#39;t need to be told how to Jack out as many kids were able to figure out the basics by instinct, but all the kids here seemed to be hesitant. Their phallic blades being tiny push pins seemingly they were all afraid of giving up or losing their manliness so quickly. The teacher tried giving some words of encouragement, but it only did so much as now at best most of the boys were androgynous at best. <br />
Caroline asked &quot;Hey Sensei, maybe we could give them a small demonstration and then maybe I could give them a hint to maybe draw out some more of their masculinity.&quot;<br />
The teacher asked &quot;Can you even form a proper blade?&quot; <br />
&quot;Proper enough to beat your probably.&quot; Caroline said confidently then turned back to the front and said &quot;Hey White Beard, I&#39;m gonna beat up your new teacher here a bit that ok?&quot; The old Master interested came out to observe the match between a DD Teacher in a proper Gi and some seemingly random woman in a skirt and thin shirt. The students were chattering wondering why a woman would challenge a man to a Dick Duel and wondering further if a woman could even form a blade or if she had a penis on her... Was she a Futa?&quot; <br />
Caroline had reached into her purse and took out of a well maintained case her old Penis. She wasn&#39;t a Futa, but as a skilled Dick Duelist she didn&#39;t feel right without her Penis nearby. Caroline reached under her skirt to attach her Penis as she formed the blade she was use to take down this immature teacher. The teacher himself had already materialized a blade about a foot longer than the one he had made before, and this time one could easily call the teacher a woman in this form. Not much of a woman but a woman. <br />
<br />
Caroline however drew out what looked more like a dagger out of her skirt. She could feel her Breasts squeeze her bra as they became C-cups and her short skirt becoming uncomfortably lifted up by her fattening ass revealing plumped up thighs, but a proper Dick Duelist isn&#39;t afraid of showing off a nude body. The students obviously weren&#39;t proper Duelists considering they were trying to hide their erections. The students were however muttering about the fact that a woman was able to draw a proper dagger-type blade. The sizing up and blade materialization had occurred. Now for the fight. The teacher made the first strike in an attempt to knock Caroline&#39;s blade out of her hand. <br />
Caroline dodge to the side noting that he was aiming for her hand or wrist instead of her smaller blade. Decent idea but... The teacher was fast as he was trying to get back into position, but Caroline the duelist was quick and fast and the teacher may as well have been still.  Caroline didn&#39;t even bother trying to strike the instructor, but went for a grapple and pulled them both down. A grapple wasn&#39;t exactly a traditional dueling move, but it was effective as Caroline was able to wrestle the teacher&#39;s dick out of his hand. Once Caroline held the Teacher&#39;s dick in her hands the fight was over and she got up. <br />
Caroline smirked &quot;Unorthodox, but in the real world the other duelist may not necessarily go straight for your blade or hand. Now what to do with this blade?&quot; The teacher looked a little pale, but Caroline said &quot;Just the tip.&quot; and used her dagger dick to cut maybe an inch off the Teacher&#39;s dick blade before tossing it back to the teacher. Her dagger grew an inch as well. Sheathing her blade Caroline&#39;s breasts and ass shrunk farther than she would&#39;ve like with the increase in masculinity. Likewise the sheathed teacher looked a bit smaller overall. Caroline took her non-bladed penis and put it back in it&#39;s proper container. There were a lot of questions, but Caroline gave one bit of advice she liked.<br />
&quot;If you draw enough of your blade that you become feminine, living in that feminine body is one of the better ways to train. Besides that knowing what your opponent will do  and countering it is a hard trick to master, but can pay off in the long run. Finally don&#39;t necessarily reject being a woman. It isn&#39;t really a big punishment.&quot; Then left to go back to her apartment. <br />
<br />
Gerald was waiting for her having came back to work early and they gave each other a hug and a kiss before Gerald helped Caroline with her bags. Caroline took out her penis and materialized an inch long blade and said &quot;Please take it, went back to the dojo and got an inch more than I would&#39;ve liked.&quot; <br />
Gerald chuckled as he opened his pants  and let his own penis blade absorb his wife&#39;s as he said &quot;You don&#39;t have to take masculinity you know.&quot; <br />
&quot;And they could try putting up a proper fight against an unorthodox attack.&quot;  Gerald sighed not getting exactly why Caroline generally stuck herself as a woman. He would&#39;ve happily given her some of his own masculinity to fight, but Caroline was Caroline.</p>
