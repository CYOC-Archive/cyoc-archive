&quot;...least Eddie seems to have accepted Kendra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess. Truth be told I&#39;m more upset at Kendra than Eddie. I thought we raised her better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We never told her the dangers of sex in her werecat form though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you honestly think she&#39;d ever tell him about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no, but...&quot; <br />
<br />
The sound of strained voiced drifted from down the hall to Kendra and Eddie&#39;s sensitive ears. Both stirred, slowly waking from their deep sleep. Yawning, and showing off his fangs, Eddie sat up and moved away from his girlfriend&#39;s still half asleep form. Kendra was immediately woken as Eddie&#39;s feline cock slipped out of her still damp cunt. His spines rubbing her, and almost making her cum. Both mewed in surprise, and Eddie was quick to apologize. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t. Are you okay?&quot; Kendra asked, shoving the spark of lust that ignited down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, I think so. Holy crap look at me!&quot; Eddie said, taking in his feline form with a much clearer head. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kendra mumbled, feeling stupid for losing control and accidentally transforming Eddie. And herself, but she thought it was a righteous punishment for what she&#39;d done to Eddie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry? Why? I&#39;m no mad. Surprised, but not mad.&quot; Eddie said, scooting over to hug his girlfriend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really. In the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s not so bad. But how do we change back?&quot; Eddie asked. He&#39;d have to go home eventually, and he didn&#39;t really want to explain to his parents why their son was now a werecat. He imagined their reaction would NOT be positive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. How long have we been asleep?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long enough.&quot; A voice from the doorway said. The two werecats looked up and shrank back when they saw Kendra&#39;s dad standing there staring at the two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi Daddy.&quot; Kendra said in a small voice. Her tail curled up against her body in fear. Her father did not look happy to see his daughter and her boyfriend in bed together, let alone transformed further than Kendra had ever gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk, downstairs. Put some clothing on and come down immediately.&quot; he said before leaving. Kendra and Eddie wasted no time in jumping to their paws, and scrambling to find clothing. The problem was, nothing fit. Kendra&#39;s multiple breasts made it difficult to find a shirt that would cover her. And Eddie&#39;s more muscular chest strained his old t-shirt. Neither can wear pants without pinning their tails against their bodies in some way. Eddie struggles with his, unfamiliar with how to control this alien appendage. Kendra helps him, much to his embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think too much of it. I had trouble after my first change too.&quot; Kendra tried to comfort Eddie. He still felt a bit ridiculous. And the feeling only intensified when he looked in the mirror and saw a teenage werecat wearing a shirt two sized too small, and its tail was awkwardly sticking out of a pair of blue jeans. <br />
<br />
Kendra finishes dressing herself while Eddie looks at his reflections. Pulling her jeans on, Kendra can&#39;t help feeling uncomfortable. The fabric feels odd against her fur, and her first instinct is to rip it off. But she doesn&#39;t want to get read the riot act naked. Shoes were impossible with their paws, so the two walk &quot;barefoot&quot; and just carry their sneakers with them. Walking down the hall, Eddie felt sweat bead down his forehead, and wet his fur. He and Kendra&#39;s father were far from best friends, and this was not how to get on his good side. Eddie wasn&#39;t sure what his reaction was regarding Kendra&#39;s and his transformations. Eddie just hoped he had nine lives.<br />
<br />
Kendra&#39;s father and mother, Leo and Jen, were waiting in the living room, curtains closed to prevent anyone from seeing the two teenage werecats. While it was clear Leo was upset, Jen tried to remain calm and passive. She knew Kendra hadn&#39;t meant for any of this to happen. She wasn&#39;t thrilled with her daughter&#39;s decisions or judgement, but what was done was done. <br />
<br />
Eddie and Kendra walked in and sat where Leo instructed them to. Not used to having a tail, Eddie pinned his underneath him. Yelped exactly like a cat who just had their tail stepped on would, Eddie blushed furiously and adjusted his position. Under other circumstances, Kendra would have laughed. In front of her parents, she bit back the laugh and stared at the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... you didn&#39;t take your potion this morning did you?&quot; Leo said. Kendra didn&#39;t speak, as it was painfully obvious she hadn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you had sex with Eddie while transformed.&quot; Leo continued. Again, both kept silent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Part of this is out fault because we never explained what would happen, but that doesn&#39;t excuse your actions either. I thought I warned you about what happens when you go too long between transformations. Not only does your body force the change, there&#39;s a strong possibility you&#39;ll end up going into heat as well. And judging by your scent, you are.&quot; Leo said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you like Kendra? And, uh, me too I guess.&quot; Eddie asked, only now realizing he wasn&#39;t entirely human anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Both Leo and myself are like the two of you. The... condition is hereditary. The only way someone else can become a werecat is unprotected sex while one is transformed, or through blood contact. Meaning if Kendra gave you a transfusion, or something of that nature, you&#39;d transform.&quot; Jen explained in a soft voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you ever tell me that?! I wouldn&#39;t have had sex with Eddie if I knew that!&quot; Kendra demanded, her tail fluffing up as she grew angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one thing, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ever have unprotected sex with Eddie, let alone while transformed. And another, I expected you to have better judgement and self control.&quot; Leo said. Kendra&#39;s anger subsided and was replaced by a terrible feeling of shame and disgrace. She&#39;s disappointed her parents, that much was clear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we don&#39;t want to play the blame game. But we need to get you two back to your human forms before it gets too much later. You both ditched school, and it did not go unnoticed. I called your parents earlier Eddie, and told them you helped Kendra deal with an emergency. But they&#39;re expecting you home soon.&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do I change back?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It normally takes a couple of hours, but the potion will change you back immediately. The one drawback, you&#39;ll have to change again later tonight. Or risk the change forcing itself on you tomorrow. And you&#39;ve seen how disastrous that can be.&quot; Leo glanced at his daughter. Kendra blushed again, guilty bubbling up in her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know you have about a million questions Eddie, and we&#39;re more than happy to answer them. But tomorrow is a better time. Just know we&#39;re sorry this has happened. I hope you&#39;re not too upset.&quot; Jen said, handing Eddie a glass filled with what looked liked a fruit smoothie. It even smelled like one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said before to Kendra, I&#39;m not upset or angry. I&#39;ve, uh, kinda had a thing for catgirls. Really a dream come true to be dating one. I will admit, I had mixed feelings at first, but I think I&#39;m okay with this. As long as I take this potion thing every day I&#39;ll be okay, right?&quot; Eddie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no. You can&#39;t go without transforming indefinitely. But the potion keeps you from bursting into fur and fangs at inconvenient times.&quot; Leo said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t we just change back after we, uh, finished? And why am I more of a cat now?&quot; Kendra asked, blushing slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll explain more after you two are back to normal.&quot; Leo said. Jen handed her daughter a glass of potion to take. Kendra noted how different this one was from the one she normally took. Still, if her parents said it would bring them back to human form, Kendra wouldn&#39;t question taking it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bottoms up.&quot; Kendra half smiled at Eddie before bringing the glass to her muzzle (which made drinking a bit of a challenge at first). The two drank the contents of their glasses in three large gulps. It didn&#39;t taste anything like it smelled. It was more of a salty, egg flavor. Eddie fought the urge to gag and spit it out. The effects however were instantaneous. <br />
<br />
His fur immediately retreated, and his claws retracted back until they were simple human fingernails again. His paws shrank into feet, and his legs regained their human stance. His tail was pulled into his back, and Eddie suddenly felt like he was missing a part of himself. He hadn&#39;t the tail long, but he&#39;d grown to like having it. <br />
<br />
His ears tingled and he knew they must be shrinking. His eyes focused on the center of his face, and there he saw his muzzle disappearing. His whiskers fell away, and his nose lose its sensitivity. His sharp teeth dulled, and though he couldn&#39;t see them, Eddie&#39;s eyes changed back to their normal brown color. The final change was unseen to everyone else. Eddie&#39;s penis was shrinking, losing its spines, and his balls seeming retreated. He was a little sad at that, as Eddie enjoyed having his feline cock. Kendra&#39;s transformation back happened in tandem with Eddie&#39;s. The only real difference in her change was her chest. Her four extra breasts shrank until she was left with a normal torso. Eddie was surprised to find his shirt was still a bit tight on his chest. <br />
<br />
Kendra and Eddie slipped their shoes on walked to the front door. There they said their goodbyes while Kendra&#39;s parents looked on from the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll call you later, okay?&quot; Eddie said, kissing his girlfriend&#39;s cheek. It felt so weird, back to normal after his first change. Eddie wasn&#39;t sure if it was because of the potion, but he couldn&#39;t wait to get home and change back. Of course he hadn&#39;t the slightest clue how to initiate the change. It was something he&#39;d just have to work out on his own later. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. And Eddie... thank again for not freaking out.&quot; Kendra said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re still you, fur or no fur. Besides, now we&#39;re one in the same. And you won&#39;t have to worry about changing me when we have sex again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The notion of them having sex again brought Kendra&#39;s inner cat to the surface. A purr was building in her throat. Eddie walked off before Kendra could act on the feelings building inside her. She waved as Eddie drove off, and then went back inside to face her parents alone.</p>
