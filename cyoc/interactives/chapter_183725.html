<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Our protagonists are Annie, a maid that worked in a castle as a Wet Nurse, breastfeeding her daughter Millie and other children who&#39;s parents paid for them to be nursed. That was a side job, though.<br />
<br />
Our story begins in the midst of the T&#39;urfraun invasion. Millie was tucked close to her mother, drinking her milk obliviously. She was only 4 months old, and Annie sat in the fields. She was rounded up here amongst hundreds of other people. The T&#39;urfraun were close, and to be honest, they didn&#39;t have much time left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, everyone,&quot; a sorceress spoke out. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you all know what is happening by know, and it seems the only other option, for the whole kingdom&#39;s safety, is to transform all of you into the farm animals you would see in these pens.&quot; She said facing to the large fields, roughly estimating it to be 2,221,560 feet, or 51 acres. This was the largest group of people in the entire population of the kingdom to be transformed in one place.<br />
<br />
Annie looked on nervously, while Millie drank carelessly. The sorceress continued speaking. &quot;Each people will be transformed simultaneously, including me, .&quot; she then said. &quot;Hurry up now! we shan&#39;t waste time!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd quickly hurried with the sorceress&#39; commands. Annie gently removed Millie from her breast, assuming she already got her fill. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you have any child with you, please keep them attended, and if they are lost, be sure to communicate with us so we can find your child.&quot; one of the sorcerers said.<br />
<br />
The sorcerers began their spells, using unique hand movements making the palms of their hands move. A beam of light emitted from all of their hands, flashing out, affecting the villagers and townspeople heading towards the corral. Annie tucked Millie close, not knowing what would happen to these people soon. As soon as Annie felt a cramp in her legs, she knew that it started. Everyone crouched onto the floor, looking at each other. It didn&#39;t hurt, but looking at each other was awkward. <br />
<br />
Annie stood back, a sudden pressure emanating from her breasts. Everyone started to strip their clothes, including the guards, as their bodies grew larger. Her cleavage started to grow smaller, thinner, her two breasts combining to form a huge, circular mass. It appeared as a large mound on her chest. It felt weird, anything but painful, except weird. Her limbs started to grow more muscly, her hands and feet slowly fusing to form feet. She gently placed Millie down on the grown, and to much of her surprise, started to crawl on all fours. A tail sprouted on top of her ass, her legs starting to grow hair, ripping her thin sheets of leggings in the process. Her chemise ripped from her mound, revealing itself to the outside. It now had four nipples, instead of two, slowly growing larger and larger.<br />
<br />
Her back arched, her hands growing longer and stronger, until she could comfortably stand on all fours. Fur covered the majority of her  vision now, and soon enough it&#39;ll be covering every part of her body, except the chest bulge she assumed was her udder. She looked back at Millie, who was constantly gaining weight by the second. She took on similar changes as Annie, but instead of crawling, she was beginning to walk. Annie&#39;s focus was interrupted by her face and neck elongating, the fur spreading there too. Her tongue grew longer and her teeth reformed. Her new udder slid down her chest and in between her legs, completing her transformation.<br />
<br />
The entire transformation was quick, only lasting about 25 seconds. The end result was just a lot of shredded clothes, a lot of nudity, and a little bit of embarrassment. Everyone had transformed into animals at about the same time, so when everyone was done, the sorcerers used another spell to get rid of the shredded and torn bits of clothing, making it seem like a completely normal animal pen. Annie could distinguish at least three animals each person had transformed into, which were donkeys, cows and bulls, or horses. The horses and Donkeys were rallied to their respected stables (Though most of them weren&#39;t that cooperative), while the cows and bulls were herded onto the fields. <br />
<br />
Annie nudged Millie for her attention, which wasn&#39;t as hard as her new instincts told her to follow her mother. They quickly trotted to the fields, an unsettling feeling caught her udder, shaking as milk started to be produced. In fact, most of the girls in their groups weren&#39;t pregnant or with a child, and they were producing milk too. As the rest of the villagers trotted onto the field, they gathered together in a herd, waiting for the next orders to be given to them. Annie was clumsy in this new form, tripping whenever she took a step with her stiff hooves. Millie, however, looked natural in her trotting, mooing playfully as she explored the outside. It was strange looking at herself as a cow. It had all happened so fast. <br />
<br />
She hoped she could return back to her normal life after this whole ordeal blows over. She notices her pendulous udders again, this time inflating right in between her legs. She thought nothing but slight disgust upon them at first. It juggled around her crotch, bouncing against her legs each time. Her human breasts would just feel full whenever it was time to feed Millie, but, her udder was stretchy and leathery. She looked at the four long nipples, dangling down to the ground. She flicked her ears. As the breeze came, she notices them stiffen, becoming more sharp and erect. Gross. She sighed, or rather, she lowed. <br />
<br />
Most of the cows now were mooing profusely. Annie could strangely hear all of the other people/cattle&#39;s thoughts. A raven suddenly flew into the air, fluttering above the herd. &quot;Hello, former villagers.&quot; it said. It wasn&#39;t moving it&#39;s beak, or even cawing at all. &quot;I am talking to you psychologically, meaning whatever you think will be automatically heard by any nearby transformed humans.&quot; it then said. &quot;Please wait here, as the T&#39;urfraun are approaching fast. Please do not panic and remain calm, and act like normal livestock, eat grass if you must!&quot; <br />
<br />
The heard lowered it&#39;s mooing, following the sorcerer&#39;s advice and doing things naturally. Millie returned back to Annie, who rubbed her neck against her enlarged belly. Millie felt hungry, so she went up to Annie&#39;s now bloating udder and instantly latched on. Annie jumped up, feeling a familiar feeling in all the wrong places. She looked behind to find that Millie was hungrily snacking on Annie&#39;s top right teat, sucking vigorously. Millie was usually a calm eater, but the transformation had seemed to unlocked her wild side a bit. Annie winced, seeing how much more intense Millie was at feeding the before. Her udder tingled at the sensation, as it pumped in more milk to supply its demand. The skin of her udder felt taught, and it hurt, and it felt warm, and it... itched? Luckily, the relief of Millie&#39;s feeding soon relieved her pain a little bit. As soon as she felt full, she let go of the teat, letting it dangle until next time.<br />
<br />
Annie never knew how much cows actually made, her previous breasts paling in comparison in terms of milk production. She was also slightly embarrassed, since it gave her slight pleasure as well. Annie looked back at her new appendage, her tail wagged, grabbing the attention of little Millie, who attempted to play with it, jumping up and down trying to bite it. Annie had a couple laughs. It was interrupted suddenly by....</p>
