<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You slowly climbed up into the fairy&#39;s bed on the other side, though you were hesitant on whether or not to sleep above or beneath the covers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; the fair asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really,&quot; you stated as you looked down, looking at the orbs that the near see-through feminine sleepwear covered, &quot;I&#39;ve just never been... female before.&quot;<br />
<br />
And female you certainly were at the moment. Nothing could hide that, though it was strange. Your mother was a fairly tall and skinny for a human woman with small breasts and a narrow waist and your father&#39;s mother while not fat was not really skinny either. You seemed to be built more like a supermodel. Clearly the fairy didn&#39;t just switch your Y Chromosome for an X as you didn&#39;t fit the body types of either mother or your father&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, it&#39;s to make sure that no one is not uneasy by your presence until you are able to leave and return to your world,&quot; the fairy reminded you.<br />
<br />
You nodded, &quot;Yes, I know. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that this is still a first for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be only temporary,&quot; the fairy answered, &quot;Get some sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked over to watch the fairy roll onto her side, giving you a good look at her wings, folded down so that they covered her back, sort of like a cape, but didn&#39;t hang limp like cloth would. You could swear you saw several muscle grounds around where her wings met her back. You weren&#39;t about to cause or want any &quot;hanky-panky&quot; going on, but  you did admit that she was beautiful, and you partially wished she&#39;d agree to remain friends after everything was over. You lay down and closed your eyes, your mind still dwelling on the prospect of having her as a friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she can turn herself temporarily into a human woman and I can show her some of the places humans go... that we&#39;re not all bad,&quot; you thought as you drifted to sleep.<br />
<br />
Your sleep wasn&#39;t entirely easy, and you tossed and turned for a few hours. After awhile you found yourself sitting up with a grumbling in your stomach. You looked over to see that the fairy was sound asleep, her breaths soft and steady and her eyes shut. It was then that you realized that neither of you had had anything to eat that could count as dinner. The fairy might be in deep sleep, but you were hungry now.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little late night snack couldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; you whispered to yourself and rolled out of the bed and began to stumble through the fairy&#39;s home in the dark.<br />
<br />
It made for quite an adventure as you went about on tip-toe to avoid making noise and squinting, as if trying to get as much light to see as possible. It didn&#39;t entirely work and you ended up stumbling through what looked like a living room, a bathroom, back through the bedroom again before you finally found the kitchen. You managed to make out that flowers, and similar things very much made up part of the decor of the home, though they seemed to be arranged in a way that they mimicked many of the designs that humans used in plastics, wood, stone, dry-wall, and human furniture. You found it all very interesting, but wanted to sate your hunger and go back to bed.<br />
<br />
Once you found the kitchen, you walked slowly to what you assumed was the fairy&#39;s refrigerator, which looked like a giant nut of of some kind. It had a handle, which felt wooden, and when you opened it, the inside appeared to light up, not by an electric light but by the food itself. The food appeared to actually glow. On one tray there were what looked like a bowl of cherries, though they were golden in color and had a very bright glow to them. You figured it was magic and selected the bowl and began to flick individual pieces of the fruit into your mouth. Strangely, for looking like cherries, there were no pits in them. You were able to chew them easily, and they tasted very sweet, better actually that a lot of fruits you&#39;d ever had before. The fact that they tasted good made you want to have more, and you ate more. The more you ate, the more you felt a strange tingle start in your stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that tingle...?&quot; you whispered to yourself and brought a hand to your stomach.<br />
<br />
The tingle didn&#39;t answer in any way you could understand. In fact the tingle grew stronger and began to radiate through your body. With every breath you took it grew stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; you asked as your stomach actually began to glow with the same color as the cherries you&#39;d been eating. The glow rapidly grew greater in strength and intensity and soon you found your whole body glowing with a bright light, the same as the cherries you&#39;d been eating.  You then began to vocally cry out &quot;Please stop! Please stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your cries did you no good the tingle grew stronger within you and began to actually move to your back and as your whole body glowed. You tried to fight it, but not only were you unable to stop it, you soon found yourself floating in the air and glowing like flashlight, illuminating the entire room. The tingle on your back grew stronger and you soon strangely felt several new muscles twitch on your back. They seemed to go back and forth in rapid motion. The motion wasn&#39;t that much, but it went rapidly, and with each twitch of these muscles, you felt something grow there, though you couldn&#39;t tell what. You didn&#39;t know what to be freaked out more by, the twitching on your back or the fact that your whole body was glowing. Then suddenly, it ended...<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; you screamed as your body erupted in a flash of light and you fell face first back onto the floor, the bowl shattering on impact, though you&#39;d eaten all the cherries that were in it. As you landed the glow from your body finally seemed to go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? &quot;Sir&quot; are you...&quot; came the fairy&#39;s voice, as your scream, or the light you&#39;d been giving off had awakened her, but after a moment she seemed to stop.<br />
<br />
You saw the room illuminate as the fairy entered, gesturing to what looked a couple rows of flower lamps along the walls. As your eyes met hers, you found her looking startled and greatly shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ate fairy food,&quot; she almost stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t really sleep... and well... a late night snack has always been helpful for me, so I decided to get a little something to eat,&quot; you stated, &quot;and you had this bowl of cherries, and while they weren&#39;t the color of normal cherries, they tasted very good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ate fairy food,&quot; the fairy repeated.<br />
<br />
You could only blink in confusion, &quot;what does that have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much,&quot; the fairy answered, nervously, &quot;Our world swims in magic. We fairies are magical. Our homes are magical... our food is magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I assumed that because it glowed,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you were originally human,&quot; the fairy stated, &quot;you were not meant to interact with our magics so closely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... your spell to heal me? And I didn&#39;t ask to get caught here!&quot;  you argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;The accident that brought you here and the wounds that I treated aren&#39;t the issue,&quot; the fairy answered, &quot;those are controlled spells that fairies have used in your world in times past... but you&#39;ve eaten fairy food... absorbed fairy magic from it... and it reacted to the spells I&#39;d cast to heal and disguise you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot; you asked, &quot;It won&#39;t interfere with me going home, will it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairy gave a very apologetic look and took you by a hand. She lead you out of the kitchen, the broken bowl forgotten, through her bedroom and into a bathroom that adjoined it. As she turned on a series of small flower lamps, which looked like tulips that were growing on a counter, she presented you before a mirror, which actually looked like it was made of water. In the reflection you saw something that surprised you deeply. It wasn&#39;t the fairy that had rescued you and had promised to help you, but another one. She wore a practically see-through nightie that did little to cover the swell of her bosom and a wide set of hips. She had long brown hair that had a soft blue twinkle to it, and it curled slightly at the tips. She also had two sets of butterfly wings, shaped like those of a Monarch Butterfly, but were a solid blue in color and seemed to be rather gossamer-like. The wings also faintly glowed. This new fairy also seemed to have the face of the form the fairy had given you to disguise yourself as a human woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the unfiltered magic of this world caught the disguise spell... it sensed you were me and began to revitalize you... restore &quot;your&quot; magic, and you absorbed the fairy magic it contained,&quot; the fairy said slowly, &quot;You then became a fairy... You might be allowed to visit your old home... but I&#39;m afraid this world IS your home now... as it is where we fairies live and you&#39;ve become one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The surprise was so great that you did the only thing that came to your mind. You fainted.</p>
