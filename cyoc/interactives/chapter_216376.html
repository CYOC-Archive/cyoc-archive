<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasmine had her own points of conflict as she went to bed, and a lot of it related to the fact that the Covaks family had settled into Moon Lake, mostly to help Rachel adjust and adapt to all that had happened to her in Florida. Jasmine could accept that and was even fine with the move. After all, Rachel had showed no signs of being mindless as a werecat, but still seemed hurt by being raped by her former girlfriend. It was something that while Jasmine was more than happy to tease Rachel over her growing friendship with Cynthia, she wasn&#39;t going to push anything that would hurt Rachel. For in many ways, Jasmine missed the happy and confident Rachel that she&#39;d grown up with. Sure, Rachel was always the most outgoing of the Covaks children, but Rachel still taught Michelle and Jasmine everything they needed about school and many other things growing up. Jasmine liked that... and in one act of sexual desire, Leslie had taken that away. If Moon Lake could bring the &quot;old&quot; Rachel back, at least so far as Rachel&#39;s confidence, Jasmine would be more than happy for it.<br />
<br />
But Moon Lake was just as much of a change for Jasmine as it was for Michelle. Though, in many ways, the difference for Jasmine was different from Michelle. Jasmine knew her twin was more into sports and things like that. For her, though, it was in a lot of the social relationships. Jasmine knew what she, Michelle, and Rachel had inherited from their mother, and in Florida she wasn&#39;t afraid to use that to her advantage. She did cheerleading and the dance team, knowing that a lot of teenage boys would love anything that would let them gawk at girls, and that gave Jasmine plenty of chances to find boyfriends and get favors, which often worked out well. Often because she was able to play &quot;hard to get&quot; at times and &quot;flirty&quot; at others, which helped her with homework, or at least figuring out where to find the answers than anything else.<br />
<br />
It ultimately meant that she wasn&#39;t a virgin, but then, her mother had had all of the Covaks girls on a birth control regimen for health and &quot;just to be safe&quot; reasons, so Jasmine didn&#39;t see that as a problem. The problem was more what she found in Moon Lake. It wasn&#39;t the existence of weres, as she&#39;d gotten used to that with Rachel as a werecat, but that so many of the people at Moon Lake High were weres that they were built like she, her mother, and sisters were built. It was something that ultimately meant that Jasmine wasn&#39;t going to stand out in Moon Lake in the way that she did in Florida, and while weres had a higher libido than normal humans, they also seemed to be pretty dedicated to not getting openly playful with normal humans. Thus, once the boys in Moon Lake figured out that it was Rachel Covaks who was the Covaks&#39; family were, they weren&#39;t quite as open to flirting with Jasmine as she would have wished. No one was unfriendly, and she&#39;d hung out with a couple of girls her age at school that were weres and made friends with them... but it was all still different from Florida.<br />
<br />
That was ultimately enough on Jasmine&#39;s part to seriously consider becoming a were herself, if only to see if she could manage to play the same game she&#39;d been able to play in Florida. Some of the rest was a degree of jealousy over Rachel and Michelle. Rachel had Cynthia, who even Jasmine could see was cute and seemed to have some interest in Rachel that went beyond being just a student advisor. And after overhearing part of the discussion between Rachel, Cynthia, and Charlene, Jasmine managed to get some hint that Rachel on some level liked Cynthia back. Then at the same time, Michelle won the attention of that werehorse, Hank, at school. To a degree, Jasmine liked him and even tried a little bit of flirtation during one class they had together, but he didn’t seem to respond to that, and then he just makes friends with Michelle. That left Jasmine a bit jealous, as she had had plenty of boyfriends in Florida, and now had none close by… and only William Abernathy from Florida was still interested in her…<br />
<br />
Thus, Jasmine settled into bed with thoughts running on what she wanted in the future and wondering why the were boys didn&#39;t seem as interested in her, and all of that was on her mind as she went to sleep...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jasmine seemed to blink as she listened to a series of glasses clink together and she found herself looking around in a rather upscale house that seemed a lot bigger than what the Covaks had moved into. It was well decorated with the upper parts of the walls painted white with the lower half being a sort of wood paneling that carried a sort of cabin-like feel to it without it being a cabin. In some ways it felt like a rather upper-class environment that wasn&#39;t made to look like a super upper-class type place. Though Jasmine didn&#39;t get too long a time to dwell on that as she found herself surrounded by a group of men, all of them were in tuxedoes.<br />
<br />
Several of them were gathered around a large glass platform that at the top looked like it was holding a bucket of ice, and in that ice was a large bottle of champagne. The men that were there had poured themselves glasses from the bottle and then lowered the bottle back into the bucket where it was surrounded by the ice. The clinking of the glasses coming together had come from this group and she slowly approached with some curiosity, noting that none of the others seemed to protest Jasmine&#39;s movements. A part of Jasmine&#39;s mind wondered on her thinking of some kind of party and that she was invited to it, but she wondered what kind of party. But it was something that could have left her wondering why everyone at this party seemed to be male and that she was the only woman present.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here she is, the queen we&#39;ve all come to worship,&quot; said one of the men around the platform holding up the champagne. He was well built with a brass tiger pin on the lapel of his tuxedo.<br />
<br />
The others turned and Jasmine could soon notice that the others had pins on their lapels too. One was of a bear, one was of a leopard, one was of a fox, one was of a raccoon, and a fifth was of a wolf. The pins were all brass and of relatively moderate size, and Jasmine seemed to know that these pins indicated what kind of were they were, werebear, wereleopard, werefox, wereraccoon, and werewolf. It gave Jasmine some hint that the guests at this party were all weres, and judging by the first man&#39;s comment, were there to see her. She liked that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I do like the attention,&quot; Jasmine smiled, and noting that she was wearing a black dress that hung closely to her curves. It was a strapless dress and had a low enough cut that good portion of her upper cleavage was visible and was forcing her to wear a strapless bra. It served to attract all eyes to her, which she liked and was rather different from what she remembered encountering in Moon Lake thus far. For there, while she was comparable to the female weres in terms of her hips and bust size, it was like the male weres had little interest in her. Having the weres at this party interested in her was something very good to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You always have,&quot; came another voice, but not one that came from the gathered men that were looking to her.<br />
<br />
It made Jasmine turn around, as she looked to see other men standing around and smiling to her. Like the five around the champagne, they had pins on their lapels that told her what kind of were they were. They then parted and another person came into view. Like the others, he didn&#39;t seem to be as well built as the other men present. He was fairly athletic and could probably give Michelle a good run for her money, but then, Jasmine also recognized him quite well. She had been on the cheerleading team that rooted for him and the high school football team in Florida that the Covaks children had attended. He wasn&#39;t ugly, and in many was was a fairly decent person, but with the move to Moon Lake, Jasmine didn&#39;t expect to see William Abernathy again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill?&quot; Jasmine gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do remember me,&quot; William answered with a smile, &quot;that&#39;s great...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In part to be like the boys here you want around... to marvel at your beauty,&quot; William answered, &quot;but also to show that I am... or I can be more than just a piece of meat, like they would be to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one&#39;s ever been just a &quot;piece of meat,&quot; it&#39;s just... that well, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve found the right person yet,&quot; Jasmine spoke, finding herself more defensive than she expected, &quot;and besides... I&#39;ve only been in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You graduated college two years ago,&quot; the wereleopard said from behind her, &quot;and were a bridesmaid at both your sisters&#39; weddings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand you wanting to flirt...&quot; William spoke, &quot;but... I think you and I... I think we could be something more... Should be something more. And I&#39;d do anything for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Jasmine asked, sounding puzzled as William stood across from her. &quot;Really, Bill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything,&quot; William answered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Her dream didn&#39;t go any further as Jasmine then rolled in bed and found herself far closer to the edge than she&#39;d originally been and fell out of the bed with a fairly decent sounding &quot;thump.&quot; The landing was what woke her up and that left her puzzled. She liked the idea of a party with several men there to worship and pay attention to her. It was how she&#39;d kept things in control with her social life in Florida and was something that wasn&#39;t there at Moon Lake at the moment and was something that she felt that maybe becoming a were might correct. She&#39;d like that, and it would even let her get information on what would be the most interesting and then figuring out what to do with regard to getting Charlene to go along with it.<br />
<br />
However, the bulk of the interaction was with an old boyfriend from Florida. He was fairly athletic and was someone that Jasmine had no problem with. He was friendly and fun, and in some ways had to be good. They&#39;d had one very good date, which ended up with her going back to his place. She was looking forward to going all the way with him, because things had gone so well, but he then seemed to get shy about things to a degree. The best that Jasmine had been able to manage was to give him a hand job, and what happened next did leave her wanting more as he cleaned her up afterward in a way that cleaned up the mess and actually felt pleasurable. It was something that left Jasmine wanting more, but strangely, William&#39;s sexual interest in her seemed to decline. Instead, it was like he became some hopeless romantic around her.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t necessarily bad. William was a perfect gentleman to her, and Jasmine also knew and sensed that he could do a lot she&#39;d find pleasureful. It was something that she&#39;d want, but with the move to Moon Lake... it was like she wouldn&#39;t be able to see him again. This only raised the question on what would happen... Though, he had called her, which was nice, but it all still left Jasmine wondering why she would dream of an old boyfriend.</p>
