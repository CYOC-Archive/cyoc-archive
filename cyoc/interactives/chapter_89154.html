<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The six 12 year olds spent the next hour surfing. Katie, Samantha, and Kellie were far more experienced than the others and spent their time trying to teach the others. Mika and Claudia began to tire of surfing and decided to lay out  in the early summer sun. The young japaneese girl and the the little blonde now talked excitedly about their refound youth. Mary Elise was still determined to learn how to surf as Katie, Samantha and Kellie urged her on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow this is a lot tougher than it looks on t.v.&quot; Mary said after yet another wipeout. &quot;It&#39;s okay Mary,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;This takes time.&quot; &quot;How old were you when you started surfing?&quot; Kellie asked as she brushed a few blonde strands from her eyes.  &quot;My dad picked up surfing in the army,&quot; she said. &quot;When World War II ended he settled down on the west coast so he could surf. He started teaching me how to surf when I was six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six,&quot; Mary exclaimed. &quot;You were able to start that young?&quot; Samantha nodded in response. &quot;It&#39;s better to start young,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s like learning to ride a bike. Their are some bumps and bruises along the way but you get the hang of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad we didn&#39;t know eachother then,&quot; Kellie sighed. &quot;It would of been fun learning to surf together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Katie sighed. &quot;I wish we did start that young it would of been nice to learn together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie squeaked as the words left her mouth. She had inadvertently made a wish for the group to become younger. Looking at the ring she could see it was starting to glow again. Quickly glancing at herself and the others her fears were confirmed. The changes were only beginning but Katie could already see the girls small breasts beginning to deflate.  &quot;Did you say something Katie,&quot; Kellie asked as she slipped back to eleven. Katie shook her head and lied. &quot;No,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;Was just enjoying the ocean.&quot; Katie cleared her throat and took in her own changes. She was eleven again, her breasts were rapidly deflating as well as puberty reversed itself. &quot;Oh crud,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I dint mean to make that wish. I need to get the others back to shore before we get too young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked over at her friends and winced. The girls were now ten again, all signs of puberty had vanished from the group leaving them skinny children with innocent faces. The two piece bathing suits the group was wearing had transformed into colorful one pieces. As Katie looked towards the beach she could see Mika and Claudia were regressing as well. The two young girls had given up trying to tan and were instead playing in the sand. As the group became nine she noticed Mika and Claudia stop running and begin to build a sand castle. &quot;We have to hurry,&quot; Katie thought as she looked at the unsure nine year olds perched on their small surfboards. &quot;We&#39;re getting young so fast and the others seem to be forgetting how to surf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie watched as Samantha attempted to catch a wave and wobbled forcing her to lie down on her board. A look of confusion spread on the girls face as she tried to rationalize what was going on. It seemed like only a moment ago she could catch a wave that size without any issue but now found more difficult. &quot;Thankful they don&#39;t seem to be aware of the change,&quot; Katie thought. Quickly she formulated an idea. &quot;Hey girls I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m starting to get tired, why don&#39;t we head in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah maybe your right,&quot; Kellie squeaked in a childish voice. &quot;All the sudden I feel really tired.&quot; Mary and Samantha nodded in agreement as the four girls began paddling back to shore.<br />
<br />
The group found the trip back to be more difficult than they thought as they continued to regress. Katie could see the girls continuing to shrink as they became eight. Their swimsuits continued to alter becoming more childish in appearance. Their surfboards were also changing as they became smaller. Katie paddled as fast as her thin arms would go. Her strength was leaving her as she once again became seven.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on guys we have to hurry,&quot; she squeaked in a childish voice. The others tried to oblige Katie trying to paddle as fast as they could. There tiny bodies didn&#39;t have the steength it had only a few moments ago. &quot;Wait up Katie,&quot; Mary whined. &quot;I&#39;m not as good a swimmer as you guys.&quot;Katie looked back to see the tiny red haired girl struggling to keep up with the more experienced swimmers. Sighing Katie turned back towards the now seven year old Mary Elise and helped her paddle to shore. Katie looked up to see Samantha and Kellie reach shore. The two seven year olds discarded their tiny surfboards and immediately ran towards Claudia and Mika who were building a sand castle. &quot;Hurry Mary we don&#39;t want to miss out on the fun,&quot; Katie exclaimed as she paddled harder. &quot;Okay,&quot;Mary whined. &quot;But I need some help I only learned how to swim this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie eyes widened in terror as she looked at the little seven year old. The girls were still regressing meaning that in a moment Mary would forget how to swim. Now fearing for the little girls life Katie kicked as hard as she could. Mary tried to help as much as she could but her swimming skills were gradually leaving her making her actions awkward. The little girl was now scared being in water as she slowly forgot how to swim. Katie now attempted to touch the bottom, when she was 12 the water would of been a little above her waist, now she found she had too stretch just to touch the her toes to the ground. &quot;Mary see if you can touch the bottom,&quot; she cried. The Geary eyesd red headd nodded and tried to touch the floor. &quot;I did it, I I did it,&quot; she cried with youthful exuberance.  The little girl now started walking towards the beach shocked at how deep they were in the ocean. Katie continued to swim to shore as she watched Mary Elise become six. The little girl was in chest deep water but appeared to be okay as she made her way to shore. Katie knew she was shorter than Mary and continued to swim.<br />
<br />
Finally reaching the shoreline Katie collapsed onto the surf. The little six year old was exhausted, her muscles tired for exerting so much energy. Looking towards her group of friends she could see the five 6 year olds happily building a huge sand castle. &quot;I need to be more careful when I talk,&quot; Katie thought. &quot;We could of been in real trouble if we hadn&#39;t made it back in time.&quot; &quot;Hey sis,&quot; Kellie called in a thin childish voice. &quot;Come help us make sand castles.&quot; Katie smiled as she stood up noticing how much bigger to world seemed. She could enjoy being six or age her group of friends back to 12. Whatever her decision she knew she would need to be more careful in the future.</p>
