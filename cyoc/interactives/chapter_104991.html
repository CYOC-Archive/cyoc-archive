<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully, Jack arrived at school on time. He caught a whiff of some foul scent. Jack quickly looked around fearfully to see if any jocks were nearby. There were none. He realised, with a start, that the BO was coming from himself. This wasn’t how he wanted his students to see him on his first day, all sweaty and panting.<br />
	Jack waddled inside the building. Somehow, he just knew where his classroom was. Along the way, he spotted his brother at his locker and waved to him. Eric waved back. Jack continued to waddle along, chins swaying and belly jiggling.<br />
	Eric had gone for an early morning run and had arrived at school before his brother. He had been at his locker when his brother waddled past. Eric could see Jack’s body hair through the gaps in his shirt and he could see Jack’s pants straining to hold in all of his fat.<br />
	Had Jack always been that flabby and out of shape, Eric wondered. Either way, he was adamant that he was not going to feel the effects of the ‘family curse’ and get fat like his brother. Honestly, he didn’t want to get a mammoth belly that jiggled like Jack’s. Eric had to talk to the jocks now. He was sure that they would be able help him get in shape, he thought, staring at his sizeable gut forlornly. <br />
	Luckily, he spotted Simon swaggering down the hallway. Eric ran up to him.<br />
	“Hey Simon, I need your help. I’m trying to exercise and lose some weight. Do you have anything tips that can help me?” Eric asked.<br />
	“Well bro, I don’t really have any tips but I do have this energy drink. It’s definitely going to help you lose weight and become more jock-like,” smirked Simon, eyeing Eric’s thatches of chest and pit hair. He knew that Eric would be a very hairy jock soon.<br />
	“Cool, thanks Simon!” Eric said as he took the bottle from Simon and went off to class.<br />
	Simon laughed to himself. The drink that he had given to Eric wasn’t an energy drink. He, Devon and Alex had made the drink themselves. The three of them had collected their sweat and put it in the bottle. They had also put in some of their precum. Simon had even gotten Devon to put in some of his stinky pubic hair and Alex to fart in the bottle for a little extra kick. He couldn’t wait for Eric to become a jock just like him.<br />
	It was now the end of teh school day. Somehow, Jack had gotten through his first day teaching physics. Reality had been altered in such a way that Jack perfectly understood the physics topics he was supposed to be teaching. So, all in all, he felt that his first day had gotten pretty well.<br />
	Devon then walked into his classroom. Jack saw Devon looking at him and stifling a laugh. Jack guessed he looked ridiculous, with his undershirt riding up and his belly and body hair exposed through the gaps of his shirt. Very unprofessional, he thought.<br />
	“Hey man, take this packet. There’s some powder inside. I want you to take the powder and pour it into a cup of water, then give it to the first geek you see tomorrow morning,” Devon ordered. Following that, he left the room quickly, almost as if he didn’t want to be seen talking to a teacher.<br />
	Jack knew what the powder would do. It would turn yet another geek into a dumb jock. But he had no choice, if he didn’t do it, the jocks would most certainly punish him. Jack then left his classroom and waddled home, before another jock came and demanded him to turn a geek into a jock.<br />
	Jack arrived home, drenched in sweat. His parents were still at work but he could hear Eric in his room. He slowly climbed up the stairs and went to his room. <br />
	As if on instinct, he took off all his clothes and headed to take a shower. It took much longer took soap up and rinse off his large body. Eventually though, he was done. He sniffed his armpits. Although he had washed them thoroughly, Jack could still smell some BO. He sighed. He waddled over to his bed and laid his hairy, mammoth body down. He closed his eyes and fell asleep, exhausted from waddling about the whole day.<br />
	Meanwhile, Eric was in his room, chugging down the ‘energy drink’. It tasted foul and he was trying not to think about it as he gulped it down. When he had finished, his stomach was churning and he felt a bit woozy. Eric too decided to lie down and take a nap.</p>
