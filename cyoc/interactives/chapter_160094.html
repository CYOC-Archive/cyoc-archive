<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m getting that ball back!&quot;  said Alex.  &quot;Come with me Teddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy shook his head no.  &quot;Come on, not gonna let a girl be braver than you, are ya?&quot;  teased Alex with her tongue stuck out.  <br />
<br />
After that Teddy nervously relented.  One of the other boys wanted to come with them. Then Alex had a fun idea and made up a story.  &quot;Well, did you know that house is haunted?&quot;  She said.  They  laughed, but she continued.  &quot;Two lovers lived here, but they were murdered in bed by a serial killer.  So if you enter, you must never have more than 2 people in your group, or you might get possessed, and the third person will be possessed by the killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kids got into the story, though.  &quot;How were they killed?&quot;  asked Tom Rodriguez <br />
<br />
&quot;No one&#39;s quite sure, since their bodies were never found and the killer was never caught.  Some say the killer diced them up into little pieces and hid their bodies in the walls.  Others say he actually spirited them away with magic and they&#39;re eternally trapped in another dimension, somewhere between our world and hell, and that you can occasionally hear their voices begging for help...or occasionally their cries of passion as they momentarily relieve themselves of their pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys were really interested now, on the edge of puberty as they were.  Jason Rodriguez voiced a particularly naughty thought.  &quot;So if we hear any cries of passion, we&#39;ll know it&#39;s just the ghosts, huh?&quot;  he teased, &quot;It&#39;s not just that you&#39;re trying to get Teddy alone for yourself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy&#39;s eyes widened and he looked at Alex.  &quot;Ew, gross!&quot;  Said Alex, &quot;Like I&#39;d ever do that with one of you losers!&quot;  But the look in Teddy&#39;s eyes did leave her blushing a little.  &quot;Anyway, come on Teddy!&quot; She said and grabbed him by the hand to drag him after her.  <br />
&quot;And remember no following!&quot; She shouted to the other two, knowing full well that they probably would.<br />
<br />
They climbed the fence, and found the ball shortly, but Alex didn&#39;t want to come back.  &quot;Come on, let&#39;s see inside!&quot; she said.  The door was hanging loosely from one  hinge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; said Teddy<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, afraid of the ghosts?&quot;  said Alex.  &quot;Oh no,&quot; she teased, &quot;I think I feel something coming over me!  I must be getting possessed!  I want you, lover!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez,&quot; said Teddy, &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it, lover.  It&#39;s the ghost!  Why I might do all sorts of things that I can&#39;t be  held accountable for!&quot;  She was having a blast teasing him, but there was no way she&#39;d actually do anything with him, of course. She just wanted to get him to follow her.  &quot;I&#39;ll be in the bedroom, dear.&quot;  She said with a wink, and disappeared inside.<br />
<br />
***Teddy***<br />
<br />
If Teddy had any remaining reservations, they were crushed by the thought that he might get somewhere with Alex sexually.  The horny young boy was awakening to new sexual urges practically by the second.  He followed, and soon found himself stepping in the door.  The place was certainly spooky enough to fit with her story, with cobwebs and shadows in every corner, and the floorboards creaking under his feet.  He felt watched, and turned his head to see a broken porcelain doll lying on the ground, it&#39;s one remaining eye pointed right at him.  Well that was creepy.  Then he saw a spot on the ground.  Wait, was that...blood?  It sure looked like it.  But, it was just one little drop.  Anything could explain that.  It wasn&#39;t a sign of a murder.  He shrugged it off and proceeded inwards.  Which way had Alex gone?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh lover I need you!&quot;  Came her teasing, yet decidedly still sexual cry, echoing through the halls.  Teddy felt his dick stirring in his shorts in ways it never had before at the sound, and he hurried after the sound.  Upwards.  She was upstairs.<br />
<br />
When he arrived upstairs he saw a glimpse of her waving to him.  &quot;Hey, come check this out!&quot; she said before disappearing into a room.   He chased after her into the master bedroom, but when he turned the corner into the room his eyes widened in shock.  The room was perfectly preserved!  It didn&#39;t look like a day had passed since it had been in use years ago.  It was a beautiful room, with mahogany furniture, a grandfather clock, a glass chandelier, and a beautiful if rather suggestive painting of what appeared to be Adam and Eve.  Eve was tempting Adam with the apple by sitting it between her breasts, which were rather larger than in most depictions of the couple.  It also had a collection of porcelain dolls in a glass case.  Teddy tried not to look at those though.  They were creepy.  If he had looked closer, he might have perceived a look of warning in their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wild, huh?&quot;  said Alex.  &quot;I wonder who&#39;s been going through the efforts to preserve this room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If someone&#39;s doing this, then they might come back.&quot;  said Teddy.  &quot;We should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, that&#39;s no fun.&quot; said Alex, and fearlessly she got up on the bed and started jumping.  &quot;Scaredy cat, scaredy cat!&quot;  She taunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, stop that!&quot;  said Teddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look either you can run away and I&#39;ll tell everyone you chickened out, or you can get up on this bed with me and I&#39;ll tell them I&#39;ll let you go to second base with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;Can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex blushed.  &quot;No.  But I&#39;ll tell them we did.  Bragging rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy looked crestfallen, but he said &quot;Ok&quot; and joined her.  They jumped on the bed for a minute, but then Teddy tripped and they ended up falling on the bed, with Teddy on top. <br />
<br />
***Alex***<br />
<br />
When Teddy fell on top of her, Alex&#39;s first reaction was to shove him off before he could get any ideas, but suddenly...suddenly she felt odd. She shook her head and it fell upon the ticking hands of the grandfather clock.  A chill came over the room, and both of the pre-teen&#39;s eyes glazed over.  Alex was watching the second hand of the clock when suddenly it jumped forward several seconds!  How the...<br />
<br />
Then she felt something poking her in the abdomen.  Teddy had an erection! But he hadn&#39;t when he&#39;d first fallen on her.  It was as if he&#39;d gone from fully flacid to fully hard in an instant? She turned her head back towards him and her lips opened to tell him to get off, but then he captured them with his.  Stars exploded in her brain as she received her first kiss.  She should push him off.  Yes, that&#39;s what she should do...but...but it felt so good, and the young girl couldn&#39;t help but feel curious.  The room seemed to get even chillier and her nipples were soon poking out.  She gave in and kissed him back.  When eventually their lips parted the two horny youths looked into each other&#39;s eyes with nothing but lust.  Alex didn&#39;t know what was coming over them, but when she felt his hand grab her tiny budding breast, she didn&#39;t care.  Teddy captured her lips again, and then started to slowly dry hump, unable to contain his instincts.  Alex moaned with desire as she felt his dick thrusting against her, and wasn&#39;t about to tell him to stop, but then her eyes opened for a second as she looked upwards.  Above the bed was a mirror, but what she saw in the mirror wasn&#39;t herself and Teddy, it was instead two naked adults.  They were doing the same thing as Teddy and Alex, except that they were naked and the male was penetrating the female.  Alex opened her mouth to scream but the woman in the reflection smiled at her, and suddenly she couldn&#39;t.  Then teddy captured her lips again, and all she could feel was lust.  She should be terrified, but all she could think about was sex.  She wished they weren&#39;t wearing clothes...and then they weren&#39;t!  By apparent magic their clothes had vanished, and now she could feel her hard nipples grazing Teddy&#39;s chest, and his cock rubbing against her with every thrust.  Teddy didn&#39;t seem to notice, other than with a growl of greater lust.  <br />
<br />
But the more he thrust, the bigger he got!  His frame was growing, his muscles bulking, and even his cock grew longer and thicker, and yet it moved lower on her body, for with his arms he was slowly positioning her higher up on the bed, so that with every thrust the danger of penetration grew greater.<br />
<br />
Alex was changing too, growing shapely and womanly and her legs grew long and luscious as she wrapped them around her suitor.  Her hips flared out as she thrust them up to meet him.  Most of all, her budding breasts grew.  At first they scarcely required a bra, but it didn&#39;t take long until they reached sizes that most bras would struggle to contain.  Last of all, she could feel her mind, nay her very soul, changing.  Again she should be afraid, but she was too horny, and as the aggressive tomboy melted away into a total submissive of a buxom woman, all she could do was moan.  &quot;Take me lover!&quot;  She cried, and as at last his cock found its target, he did.<br />
<br />
***Jason Rodriguez***<br />
<br />
Jason and Tom had waited a little, but it was inevitable that they would follow.  When they crossed the threshold into the house, they couldn&#39;t help but notice the chill.  Then they heard the cry of &quot;Take me lover!&quot; and Tom rolled his eyes.   &quot;Boy, she&#39;s really gotten into this gag,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s gotten so naughty too!&quot;  said Jason.  &quot;I admit I think it&#39;s hot.  Hell that was a great impression of an older woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True.&quot; said Tom with a grin.  &quot;She&#39;s definitely gotten sexier recently.  Well, let&#39;s find them before Teddy has too much fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom stepped forward, but before he could go any further his brother suddenly kissed him full on the lips.  He pushed him off.  &quot;Gross!  What the hell, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason only rolled his eyes.  &quot;Oh do hurry and possess him, lover.&quot; said the boy in a strangely feminine and seductive tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you-AH! No!&quot;  Tom bent over as he clutched his head.  &quot;Stay out of my head!  Noooooooo!&quot; He cried, but that was his last cry as Tom Rodriguez, for soon another was looking out through his eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, love&quot;  said &quot;Tom&quot; as he pulled his brother to him and they kissed again.  As they did so, their forms shifted, growing and expanding, though in different places.  Tom grew big and manly, and a black robe appeared to cover his growing form, though as it was open in the front it left his muscular bare chest revealed, and his erection was bulging out through nothing more than a loincloth.  <br />
<br />
Jason, on the other hand, was growing curvier. His clothes vanished.  As his ass was fiercely grabbed and kneaded it grew plump and soft in his twin brother&#39;s hands.  Jason was still in there, but he couldn&#39;t control his body.  He screamed inside but was helpless to stop his chest from expanding into two full breasts, or to stop himself from pressing them into his brother&#39;s now broad chest.  Then he felt his brother&#39;s dick, slipping out from underneath the loin cloth, touch the tip of his own, and then Tom *thrust* and Jason&#39;s dick was forced back up inside, and foreign pleasures overwhelmed the young boy&#39;s brain as he felt his brother&#39;s dick penetrate his new pussy.  <br />
<br />
As the two lovers came together, completing their transformations, at last a similar robe appeared around Jason, affording her a measure of modesty.  They parted, and the ghost-witch&#39;s cum dripping pussy became covered, but only by a sheer pair of black panties.  Modesty wasn&#39;t the territory of a witch or warlock<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Adarris, dear,&quot; said Jason, &quot;I think Jocelyn and Frederic upstairs will be finished with their hosts soon.  Shall we go take care of them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, Deviline, my love.  It is my one consolation for what they did to us that we will be eternally taking our vengeance.&quot; said Tom, and with that the ghosts of the witch and the warlock who had long ago murdered the two lovers who lived in the house headed upstairs to do it all over again.   It was inevitable, for the spell that the dark magic users had used with intent of capturing the souls of their dead victims had backfired, trapping their own souls as well, and so the 4 souls would repeat the events with the bodies of any beings foolish enough to enter the house, trapping more and more souls there, perhaps forever.</p>
