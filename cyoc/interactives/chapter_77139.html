<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As the old man walked away, down the hall, Trent closed the door to his apartment while grasping the bottle in his hand tightly while looking 
at his friend Nate... the newly minted werewolf. Trent wondered what would happen next and if Nate could even become human again. However, 
while standing there, Trent was definitely excited that there was a real life werewolf in his midst... the first ever! Trent was ecstatic since he always 
had a thing for werewolves and dreamed of becoming a werewolf, no matter how much it was impossible. Hell... Trent even knew that Nate had an 
affinity for werewolves as well and that was one reason why the two got along so very well. There were many nights where the two of them would 
have a mini werewolf movie marathon and now that Nate was a werewolf, Trent wondered exactly what would happen next.</br>
<br>"So Nate... how are you feeling about all of this?" Trent asked with a slight bit of caution in his voice.</br>
<br>Nate smiled a wolfish and fanged smile, then spoke in his deeper and guttural voice. "You know... at first I was a bit mad, but now I 
absolutely love it! This has to be one of the best things to ever happen to me!"</br>
<br>"Yeah... you aren't mad at me for... this?" Trent asked tensely.</br>
<br>"LIke I said, I was at first, but now... look at me. I am a fucking werewolf! This has to be the best thing EVER!" Nate said with excitement.
</br>
<br>"Yeah... I have to admit... it is really cool and you are lucky to be a werewolf..." Trent said with a somber voice, looking down at the ground 
standing close to his friend.</br>
<br>"Hey... why so sad buddy?" Nate asked, placing a clawed finger under his friend's chin and raised Trent's head to look at him in the muzzle. 
"You know, there is still some of that potion left... you could take it and become a werewolf like me!" Nate said comfortingly.</br>
<br>"Yeah... I know I could, but I also did this to you... so I think it would be a better option for you to do what you wanted. I have a whole bottle 
of the stuff I was going to put in your drink originally and make you the perfect match for me..." Trent said without realizing what he said, 
covering his mouth with both of his hands.</br>
<br>Nate looked at Trent with a raised brow, not sure if what he heard was correct in his own mind. "Did you say you were going to turn me into 
your perfect match? I... I don't know whether to be mad or happy..." Nate said with a growl toward the end, definitely showing his annoyance over 
the whole situation.</br>
<br>Trent, knowing he needed to diffuse the situation quickly and fearing for his life slightly since Nate was a werewolf who could easily make 
mince meat out of him, stood chest to furred chest with Nate and softly stroked Nate's arm. "Nate... I will be honest with you. I... I am gay and I 
have had a huge crush on you for some time and since I didn't know if you were gay or even had the same feelings for me as I do for you, I was 
going to give you that potion and then... well... we could become partners in life..."</br>
<br>Hearing Trent's words, Nate's attitude changed and calmed as his ears relaxed and lowered, while his heart melted for his friend. "Aww... 
Trent... I didn't know you felt like that about me! To be honest, I have had a huge crush on you for the longest time as well..." Nate said calmly, 
placing his paw on Trent's right shoulder and kneaded it slowly.</br>
<br>"R-really...?! You... had a crush... on... ME?!" Trent questioned, never ever thinking that the feelings would be mutual.</br>
<br>Hearing his friends words, Nate silently nodded his head and gave Trent a loving lick on his cheek. "Yeah, you and I are perfect for each 
other and I always thought we would make a great couple... but now... now things are different. I am a werewolf and you are a human." Nate said 
with a bit of sadness in his voice.</br>
<br>"Well... remember what you just said to me, there is probably enough in this bottle of Lycanthropy potion to make me a werewolf too. You 
could also bite or scratch me, which would turn me as well. Hell... I am sure that if we had sex right now that would make me a werewolf as well." 
Trent said comfortingly, giving options to his werewolf friend and crush.</br>
<br>"Yeah, I guess that is always an option..." Nate said, trailing off with a devious grin on his muzzle.</br>
<br>"Well... here..." Trent said handing the bottle of 'Perfect Match' to Nate. "I want you to take this and do what you want with it..."</br>
<br>Nate looked at his friend, then the bottle and grasped it firmly in his paw and thought about all of the options that there was now and then 
said, "You know... I think I have the perfect solution!"</br>
<br>Trent looked at Nate quizzically as Nate plodded over to where the drinks were, opened the bottle of 'Perfect Match' and poured the entire 
contents in Trent's drink, then put the top back on the bottle and then chugged the rest of the 'Lycanthropy' bottle then thew both away in the 
trash. Nate grinned as Trent walked over to where he was, and by Trent's facial expression... Trent was wondering what Nate had done. As Nate 
lowered himself to the nearby sofa and started to get comfortable, there was a huge rack of pain that came over his body, but Nate did his best 
not to let it show.</br>
<br>"Well... how about you drink your beverage and let's see what happens!" Nate said with a grunt and a grin.</br>
<br>"Sounds like you are up to something..." Trent said.</br>
<br>"Yeah... no more than what you were up to that led us to this point." Nate replied with a cheeky wolfish grin.</br>
<br>Trent grinned, knowing Nate was right as he leaned down and grabbed his beverage. Not knowing what was in it, whether it was the rest of 
the Lycanthropy potion or the whole bottle of 'Perfect Match', Trent swirled the drink in his hand to mix it up. Knowing that his friend and 
admitted mutual crush only had his best interest in mind and in heart, Trent placed his cup to his lips and downed the whole mixture, then sat 
down and waited. As Nate sat there, he started to feel the rest of the Lycanthropy potion taking effect and changing him further. Nate groaned as 
his muscles grew and he bulked up to the size of a powerlifter; his teeth and claws lengthened a bit more, sharpening and becoming much more 
dangerous; then a mental switch hit him... feeling more feral and beastly, Nate grinned and reveled in how he was feeling. Then Nate began 
feeling something else, like he was right in the middle of a battle... a battle to whether he was going to be good or evil, but which side he would 
go to was yet unknown. As Nate sat there, he could feel himself sway further to one side and he was definitely enjoying it, while he noticed that 
Trent was starting to change as well. Trent's ears started to grow and stretch to points as other pieces of Trent were showing signs of 
transforming into a werewolf just like Nate was. Inwardly, Nate knew that Trent would turn into a beast like him, exactly how he saw his perfect 
match to be and Nate knew that which ever side of good or evil Nate went... Trent would follow as well. Nate had a good suspicion before putting 
the potion into the drink that the person drinking would become the perfect match for the one who 'administered' the potion to the subject. The 
question was which side would that be and what kind of a werewolf would Trent become?</br></p>
