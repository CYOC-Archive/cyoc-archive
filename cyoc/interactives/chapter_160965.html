<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The world is a mess and everything everywhere was closed down. Streets far and wide, in small towns or large cities were open and barren with nary a soul in sight, looking as if all traces of living humans were gone while the paved streets and buildings of varying sizes were nothing more than monuments to the achievements and architectural accomplishments of humanity. Everyone everywhere was too afraid to go anywhere or do anything anymore with the paranoia surrounding the viral pandemic around the world, known to most as either: &quot;Covid-19&quot; or the &quot;Corona Virus&quot;. It initially started with panicked buying of household goods such as toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and household cleaners. However, it soon turned into panicked buying of staple food items that would have a massive shelf life all due to a preventative measure known as &quot;Social Distancing&quot; due to the fact that transmission spread through close contact of human beings via &quot;respiratory droplets&quot; where a bit of aerosolized fluid from the body of anyone could have contained the virus that was spreading like wildfire because while some were showing symptoms of being sick, others were simply carriers and lived their lives completely oblivious to the fact that they had it too even though they were not sick. However, even with social distancing and all of the other measures, the cases were increasing and the deaths were increasing as well. The rest of the world was able to do something, known as &quot;flattening the curve&quot;, but yet the United States of America... the supposed wealthiest country in the world... couldn&#39;t get its head out of its ass and take care of the American people, thus allowing the virus to continue to propagate and spread, infecting the whole of the world a second time that only served to create continued hardship on an already strained system both medically and financially.<br />
<br />
A man, who could no longer take being in his home, decided to go out for a walk one night to see what was actually going on in the local world around him. A world that he roamed in was vastly different from the one that he was used to before all of this. Living in the city, in a condo high above the ground, he was used to seeing a world full of people and the hustle and bustle that they were typically consumed by day in and day out. He would often watch the people down below as they moved about the large city, both day and night, in a place that was typically known by its nickname &quot;The City That Never Sleeps&quot;. Being on the ground, in the cooler air of the early spring night, he saw absolutely no one. There were no adults roaming the streets, going to night clubs or bars or jazz clubs or any other venue of entertainment. There were no adolescents on the basketball courts sneaking in a late-night game of basketball. There was literally nothing going on and no one to fill any place with a semblance of life. Everything was quiet, dead and lifeless along the asphalt streets and the infinite sea of towering structures of steel and glass. It felt as if the city itself had given up its vibrant lifeblood and succame to the Corona Virus that was taking human lives... seemingly taking the economic lives and the city&#39;s lives all across the world. He felt odd standing in the middle of the asphalt street outside of the back entrance to the skyscraper that housed his home on the fifty-second floor, not having a car of any kind honking at him with a random person rudely sticking their head out of the driver&#39;s window and rudely screaming profanities at him to get out of their way as he would no doubt be holding them up and prevent them from getting where they were heading to. Curious to see if he could find any sort of life, the man decided to walk about the back alleys and stay out of the sight of the police that undoubtedly patrolled the streets looking for any who would violate the &quot;Stay At Home&quot; orders that the governor was strictly enforcing since getting a handle on the virus was next to impossible as it was.<br />
<br />
As the man wandered the back alleys, not really paying any sort of attention to where he was going, he stopped for a moment as he felt his shoe come untied and the pressure of the tongue against the roof of his foot lessened. Bending down on one knee and retied his shoe, there was an odd and bright neon light that illuminated the entire area and bathed him in the various colored lights. Curious to see the source, knowing that there were strict orders for any place deemed non-essential to be closed down, the man stood up from retying his shoe and saw the source... a sign for a bar. It was a simple sign written in neon orange light, reading: &quot;A Real Man&#39;s Bar&quot; with a large, burly kind of guy with a yellow neon light for his exposed skin, reds and blacks interlaced for a flannel style shirt a lumberjack would wear and blue neon for his blue jeans tightly hugging against his thick muscled thighs. It was a sign of life... a sign of vibrancy in a world that was supposed to be desolate and destitute. The man stood there for a moment, thinking about and contemplating his options all things considered. He knew that such places were supposed to be closed and perhaps the owners forgot to simply turn off the power to the neon sign... but that would be a bit of gross negligence on their part since it would be wasting money with nothing coming in to pay the bills. He couldn&#39;t help to feel a tug... a proverbial pull internally at his strings of curiosity, working out in his head that &quot;one little look wouldn&#39;t hurt anything&quot;. He could still be socially distant with the occupants inside... should there actually be anyone in there. He could observe the rules and still be social... it would be an even more welcome thing than staying in his condo like he has had to since this whole pandemic began. He was tired of being cooped up in his home and it was all the more reasoning that led him to go where he would normally dare not.<br />
<br />
Without thinking about it, the man found his feet taking him to the front door as if his feet had been placed on autopilot by his brain in order to find out what was beyond those doors. Initially... he figured he would just test the door to see if the door was even unlocked, but further... he would enter to see who was there and peruse the establishment just as a break he felt he desperately needed. In his own mind, he wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong. It was super late in the evening and it was highly unlikely that he would even come across anyone that he could spread the virus to... if he even picked it up from the establishment. He lived alone, so the only person that he would be spreading it to further would be himself. He had no one to come to his place and even visit since ninety percent of the population of the planet was too scared to venture out unless it was absolutely necessary. He reasoned with himself that he desperately needed the break and he was going to take it.<br />
<br />
The only questions were: who was the man breaking the rules and what would he find inside, if the door was even unlocked for him to venture inside.</p>
