<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick and Frank spent the next few minutes cursing and wandering around lost. They had left everything in the backpack that Nol&#39; had been carrying, including their phones, and had been running on pure instinct. They had not paid much attention to how many corners they had turned. <br />
<br />
After nearly an hour of searching they saw a sign for a park. The university park, and decided they should check it out. Rather, Frank decided, taking complete control over the situation as they went down the street the signpost stated.<br />
<br />
Arriving a few minutes later they realized that this was not the right park, as there was a small crowd watching a game of soccer. Noticing the small camera crew present, Frank had asked a bystander what was going on, and learned that the university team was hosting a Dutch soccer team from a university in the Netherlands. <br />
The local new was there broadcasting the game live to the entire county, and with only a few minutes left on the clock, The dutch team was winning 4 points to 2.<br />
<br />
They last few minutes were building to a fever pitch, as the home team was pushing towards a final goal, passing the ball rapidly back and forth between their players as they made a last desperate push for a goal. Frank and Patrick watched, allowing themselves to be distracted by the building energy of the crowd. <br />
<br />
Patrick noticed the Dutch players were not being very aggressive, giving the home team time extra moments here and there, allowing them to build their momentum. He smiled, realizing they were allowing the team chance for a point, since they had already won the game regardless. A few quick passes and a sliding kick later and the crowd erupted into loud cheers as the home team scored the final goal, just moments before the horn blew for the end of the game. The home team had lost by one point, but the crowd was still in good spirits. <br />
<br />
The team captains approached the camera crew and were each interviewed over the game. Both captains congratulating the other, but the Dutch captain clearly laying the praise on the other team more heavily. <br />
As the home team captain described his hope that the Dutch teams visit would lead to an ongoing student exchange program between the two universities, Patrick smiled widely as he remembered a quote that had stuck with him, something his uncle had said before he moved to another state to retire beach side. That it wasn&#39;t just about winning some times, but how you win and what your purpose was. <br />
<br />
Patrick could see that if the dutch team had played fully and won flat out, the local team and the crowd would have thought they were arrogant, showing off, but by winning with a small margin it appeared as if the teams were almost evenly matched. The entire purpose of the game was likely to build the relationship between the two universities, with the hopes of getting a specific deal out of it at the end.<br />
<br />
Patrick saw Frank talking to the same bystander again, both looking intently into the mans smart phone as they talked. Frank was likely getting directions to the other park. <br />
<br />
The home team sang  their club ballad for the cameras, followed by the dutch team singing their own clubs song. The Dutch coach briefly talking to the camera crews about sharing their cultures and about a tradition their university team did whenever they played at another university for the first time. <br />
<br />
Turning and joining his team at the goal post, the coach set up a camera on a tripod, as his team lined up in two rows. Giving a quick thumbs up to the young men, who all returned the gesture, the coach started to strip, the entire team following suit.<br />
Patrick&#39;s eyes went wide as suddenly all 18 members of the soccer team stood there, dressed only in their shoe&#39;s and socks. The Coaches naked form joined them as they they smiled at the camera.<br />
Patrick&#39;s eyes drank in their naked forms, most had smooth chests, with pale skin. Most had blonde or light brown, with two a darker brown. All of them were uncut, standing there flaccid, making no attempt to hide their exposed cocks from the onlooking crowd. Patrick felt his cock hardening in his jeans again as his eyes drank in their naked bodies, a feeling that surprised him. <br />
Shaking his head, Patrick realized the entire crowd was silent as he remembered to breathe.<br />
His own breathe feeling uncomfortably loud.<br />
The silence continued for a few seconds, but for Patrick it felt like minutes.<br />
Then the camera flash went off.<br />
<br />
“INDECENTS!” Some woman screamed at the top of her lungs, the camera crew quickly putting down their cameras as members of the campus security rushed onto the field. As the security tackled down 6 of the soccer team, and the coach, the other players scattered, clearly not knowing what was going on.<br />
<br />
As the players ripped across the field and through the crowd of bystanders, some people scattered while others within the crowd attempted to chase the nude players. Patrick felt the rising panic within the crowd and knew instinctively it was time to go. Grabbing Frank by the shoulder he thanked the bystander for the directions before pulling Frank by the wrist through the agitated crowd. <br />
<br />
They had just made it to the road as the sound of multiple police sirens approaching reached their ears, the crowd suddenly picking up volume as people started shoving each other, trying to get away the university field as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
The crowd was now in full blown panic and was Patrick had a sinking feeling in his stomach as the thought of being crushed under a stampeding crowd crossed his mind.<br />
Pushing Frank forward, Patrick told him to run and he would follow, the two muscular teens sprinting away from the chaos as the first few police cars arrived.<br />
<br />
“This way.” Frank called back over his shoulder as he led Patrick around  a corner. “The other park is this way.”<br />
<br />
Patrick nodded as he followed closely, his eyes watching Frank&#39;s muscular legs pump in front of him, the muscular ass pulled tight against his denim jeans. Patrick&#39;s cock twitched inside his jeans, but Patrick was under too much stress to get a full blown hard on now.<br />
<br />
They had to find Nol&#39;.</p>
