<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay. Despite having Ben Twist with Kenya Adaeze on Earth 1; Kenya with Nate Anderson, along with both Julie Stovall AND Brian Walker with Alyssa Cooper, and Brian with both Alyssa and Betty on Earth 2; and Ben with Anna O&#39;Sullivan on Earth 3; I had to think long and hard about whether or not to even create this episode.<br />
Yet, considering how much more sex has happened in the Moon Lake of Earth 2 stories compared to our companion threads, in the end I decided to just set up the situation and leave whether or not it actually happens for the next author to decide.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Having just experienced another fantastic round of were-sex, the werepanther caressed his hybrid mate in his strong, furry arms, passionately kissing Spencer Lawson&#39;s muzzle even as Eric Anderson felt his hard cock still twitching deep inside her damp cunt.<br />
&quot;WOW!&quot; said Eric, even as he moved to start tweaking Spencer&#39;s nipples again with his paws.<br />
&quot;My master of understatement,&quot; Spencer said with a smile, even as she moved to nibble on his ear, which the two of them and Frieda Knight had discovered was an erogenous zone in their fursonas.<br />
&quot;Is this a private party or can anyone use the basement?&quot; they heard a voice ask.<br />
The two teenage lovers looked up from their position on the floor to see Eric&#39;s mother Martha Anderson sitting on the basement steps.<br />
With more time under his belt (provided he was even wearing one) as a werepanther now, Eric no longer felt ashamed, embarrassed, or even guilty about being caught nude, furry, and having sex with either Spencer and/or Frieda.<br />
The fact that his mother was totally nude and sitting on the basement steps in her were-vixen fursona did puzzle him though.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up? And where&#39;s dad?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father has a staff meeting after his last class at the college, so won&#39;t be home until after 8 at the earliest,&quot; explained Martha. With that, the two teenagers looked up at the battery operated clock hanging from a nail on a support post and saw it wasn&#39;t even 5:30 yet. &quot;I was just wondering about something though.&quot;<br />
&quot;What Mrs. Anderson?&quot; wondered Spencer, disappointed at feeling Eric&#39;s shaft deflate inside her.<br />
&quot;First, please call me Martha. Since you will be an even bigger part of our family someday than you already are, I think you&#39;ve earned that right Spencer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. What Martha?&quot; asked the hybrid werewolf/cat/panther mixed female were with Eric.<br />
&quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d like a taste of vulpine honey?&quot; wondered Martha, even as she reached down with one paw and started caressing the outer lips of her werevixen vagina.<br />
&quot;HUH?&quot; Spencer and Eric almost asked in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;After we moved to Moon Lake and saw how much fun and sex Nate was having as a werewolf, my husband and I decided to take the plunge and become weres ourselves.* Besides, it would also be the only way we could continue being swingers and maintain our open marriage as well. Something Eric can attest to us being even before we left Minnesota,&quot; said Martha, while still caressing her cunt lips.<br />
Eric simply shook his head affirmatively as, with his panther penis at rest, reluctantly pulled out of Spencer to sit next to his main girlfriend.<br />
&quot;Anyway, in between researching what kind of weres we wanted to be and actually joining the Skulk*, William and I also researched the laws regarding sexual activity in Moon Lake. As long as every party involved is an active were, sex between an adult and a minor is legal here,&quot; explained Martha. &quot;I&#39;ve already have and will continue to experience some great times with both your parents Spencer, but being bi, I&#39;ve been curious about what you might be like.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you want to have sex with me?&quot; asked Spencer in disbelief, even as Martha now used both paws to caress her dripping pussy as her foxy tail started wagging to express the pleasure she was feeling.<br />
&quot;And me too?&quot; wondered Eric, not feeling all that great about the possibility, no matter how much he was growing to enjoy sex.<br />
&quot;Sorry kiddo. Even if I didn&#39;t find the thought of doing so repulsive beyond belief, incest is illegal, no matter who&#39;s involved,&quot; explained Martha. &quot;When I see your fursona Spencer, I see both your parents and get turned on, but if you say no I&#39;ll respect your wishes and leave, because rape is also against the law too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can we have a moment to discuss this?&quot; Spencer asked Martha, while looking at Eric.<br />
&quot;Sure. Take all the time you need,&quot; said Martha, while removing her paws from her nether regions and started licking them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Spencer asked Eric.<br />
&quot;I honesty don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;We talked about having an open relationship and both of us coming from parents with open marriages when we were first trying to figure out how to make me a werepanther. It&#39;s worked out beyond our wildest dreams with Frieda,&quot; he pointed out, while staring deeply into Spencer&#39;s green eyes that matched his own, &quot;but we never discussed possibly expanding our relationship beyond her even for just casual sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be totally surprised if we all don&#39;t wind up with different partners at least once during that werepanther meeting tomorrow night,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;As handsome and unique as you are with that white fur, Frieda and I will probably have to fight all the other women there if we&#39;re to have any hopes of keeping you to ourselves.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Eric asked in disbelief, having never thought of himself as sexy before, except around his girlfriends. &quot;But if you have sex with my mother, does this mean I can have sex with yours?&quot;<br />
&quot;Has Maggie seen your fursona Eric?&quot; wondered his mother.<br />
&quot;My dad has. She hasn&#39;t, yet,&quot; answered Spencer.<br />
&quot;Well, knowing Maggie the way I do, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d love a chance to jump his bones once she catches a glimpse of that stunning white coat and what my son has between his legs,&quot; said Martha, winking at Spencer.<br />
Eric started blushing the best he could as a werepanther as Spencer asked, &quot;Then what about me and your husband, let alone any of us and Frieda&#39;s parents?&quot;<br />
&quot;Personally, considering their attitude, I&#39;m not interested in the Knights, but after having seen Frieda&#39;s fursona at Grrrrrrr, if she expressed an interest, I wouldn&#39;t say no,&quot; admitted Martha, while licking her muzzle. &quot;William&#39;s not here this evening, so that&#39;s between you and him if the subject ever comes up, but I doubt he&#39;d say no if you asked. But neither of us will ever force ourselves on any of you. Whether you actually want to or not is always your choice Spencer, but like you said, I&#39;d seriously doubt any of you will get to stay strictly with each other tomorrow night during that werepanther meeting, especially if they&#39;re anything like Skulk gatherings, werewolf pack meetings, or any other group get together here in Moon Lake,&quot; pointed out Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; said Spencer, turning her head briefly to look at Martha, Eric, and then Martha again, before staring at the floor.<br />
Being part werecat on her mother&#39;s side, Spencer wouldn&#39;t deny liking a taste of honey every once in a while, and Frieda Knight&#39;s was VERY delicious!<br />
But to experience another woman&#39;s, especially an adult&#39;s...<br />
Then there was also the potential activities at the werepanther meeting to consider tomorrow night, along with the private session Frieda had planned for just the three of them afterwards...<br />
Spencer Lawson thought about Martha Anderson&#39;s offer for what seemed like a long time, but was only about ten minutes if anyone bothered to check the clock.<br />
Then she announced her decision.<br />
