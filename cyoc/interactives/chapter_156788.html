<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach woke up with the worst headache he had had in his life. Everything was spinning in his head and he can barely stand up. He tried to take a step but he lost balance and fell back on the mattress from where he got up.<br />
<br />
After several minutes trying to clear his senses, he looked around and realized that he didn&#39;t recognize the place where he was. A small wooden room, very rustic and simple. He wondered if he was in a cottage or aboard an old boat.<br />
<br />
He saw light coming from a window and he quickly went to look through it. The sunset gave an orange hue to everything outside. How long have I been sleeping? He wondered as he scratched his nape.<br />
<br />
Then, he sniffed something, something that didn&#39;t smell too good. It&#39;s a cottage, he tought, there must be animals close, that&#39;s why it smells like that. He ignored the smell and wandered around the room, although there wasn&#39;t too much to see in there, just a bed, a small table and a wardrobe.<br />
<br />
He opened the wardrobe and looked a lot of clothes for men, shirts, pants and underwear. He took a shirt and noticed how wide it was. There must be a really big guy living here, he thought. However, he saw something else, something that he hadn&#39;t noticed until now.<br />
<br />
The arms and the hands that were holding the shirt weren&#39;t his. They looked big and strong, like the ones from a wrestler or a bodybuilder. He liked to do some exercise but as a preteen, it was impossible for him to get those muscles.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he thought that it was just his head that was making a prank on him. But as long as he kept watching at them, it became more and more obvious that those were his arms. He stumbled after realizing it and fell back on his butt. Then he realized that it wasn&#39;t only his arms who had changed. He was staring at a big pair of hairy legs protuding from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; He shouted and immediately covered his mouth when he heard his deeper voice. The hand on his face made him realize that he had a beard growing on his cheeks and jaw. &quot;I need a mirror!&quot;<br />
<br />
He managed to stand up and desperately looked for a mirror in that room. Luckily for him, there was one over the small table and after took it with his clumsy hands he finally saw himself.<br />
<br />
The last thing he remembered before he woke up in that room was that he was a preteen, with no body hair except for a few thin hairs coming out in his armpits. Now he lifted his arms and the bushes in there were so thick that he can&#39;t see any skin under them. And that didn&#39;t finish there, because those armpits smelled like he hadn&#39;t taken a bath in weeks. There wasn&#39;t any animal near but he smelled like one right now.<br />
<br />
He used his large and calloused hands to keep exploring his new body. After years of dreaming of a wide chest like the tough guys on TV and movies, getting his own was a little more concerning that he expected. He shyly put his hands on his pecs and felt the weirdness of having two juice blocks attached to his chest. It was so surreal that he can&#39;t believe that his nipples had moved down and taken a new position pointing down.<br />
<br />
He wondered if he can make them bounce like some guys used to do in the beach and after a little struggle, he finally made it. He dumbly grinned like when he masturbated for the first time. And talking about it, he immediately put a hand on his junk and when he felt it, his dumb grin turned into a big smile and laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; He cheered as he kept touching his dick. It was soft but it was way more larger than before. He can&#39;t know how bigger it was, but it felt like holding a fat sausage. Above it, there was a bush of pubes even more thicker than the ones on his armpits that extended through his hefty thighs and upward through his new rock-hard abs in the messier treasure trail you can imagine.<br />
<br />
As he kept admiring his new shaft he started to rub it, slowly but continously until it started to get hard. That fat sausage was becoming a fat salami as blood came inside it. Unexpectedly, thick drops of a clear glossy substance started to came out from his engorged dick head. He knew it wasn&#39;t cum because he had ejaculated before and he hadn&#39;t gotten to his climax yet but it still felt so good as it created a mess in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, this feels so good!&quot; He said between moans as his big hand moved up and down in the rock-hard shaft that was covered in glossy precum. Instinctively, he used his other to hold the hefty pair of testicles that now were working as crazy to be ready to release the biggest amount of cum they could make. They were covered in a long scrotum full of kinky hairs as a symbol of pure masculinity. There are just a few men who could say they&#39;re as endowed as Zach.<br />
<br />
His heart was racing faster and faster with each second that passed. His dick was throbbing more and more until it seems to have its own life. His big and manly feet clenched as the moment all his body was expecting finally came.<br />
<br />
Like a geyser puking, his dick erupted with a lot of hot white cum which fell on everywhere, his chest, his thighs, the floor,  even on the small table where he left the mirror. After all his seed was released, he stayed in the same position for a while, panting as he recovered himself from the experience. He was confused and a little scared of what happened to him, but despite of that, he had enjoyed that brief moment like any other in his life.<br />
<br />
The door openened and a good looking guy came inside wearing only a wifebeater and yoga pants. He looked for Zach for a second until he found him on the ground panting after an intense session of jacking off. The guy put a hand on his nape briefly showing off his strong biceps as he stared a little ashamed at his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels good, is it?&quot; He told Zach. &quot;I did the same the first time I saw myself. It&#39;s so natural for a man, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, natural..&quot; Zach replied as he kept panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you recognize me?&quot; The guy told him as he gave him a hand to help him to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a friend of my big brother or something?&quot; Zach replied because he didn&#39;t know the guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you had a big brother.&quot; The guy awkwardly said. &quot;I&#39;m Mark, I meet you in those weird facilities, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark? Oh, Mark! I remember now!&quot; Zach said as he hugged his friend. &quot;You looked completely different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can say the same about you.&quot; Mark told him. &quot;Come with me, I have a lot of things to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark left the room and Zach followed him. He watched how different this manly guy looked from the regular preteen he had met in the facilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have some pants you can give me?&quot;</p>
