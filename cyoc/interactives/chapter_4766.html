<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan walked to school the usual way, still worried about Ian, but trying to put him out of his mind.   He made his way down the street, turning a few blocks, before coming up to the lovely red-brick and concrete school that bored him to tears nearly every day of his young life.<br />
<br />
          He entered the big, double, thick, plastic-glass main-doors of the several-story building, and started down the hallway to the left, heading for the Gym, and beyond that, the swimming pool room.<br />
<br />
          Halfway down the hallway, he ran headlong into “Janitor Joe,” the school Maintenance Technician, who was turning a corner, coming out of a restroom.  “ Oof!” the kindly old guy spoke as Dan ran headlong into his stomach.<br />
<br />
          “Oops!  Sorry Joe…” Dan sputtered.  “Didn’t notice you there…”<br />
<br />
          The old guy laughed, “Heh, no problem kid…. Hey, you’re late, ain’t ya?”<br />
<br />
          Dan sighed and shrugged, “Yeah… had to do some stuff and lost track of time…”<br />
<br />
          “Well, if ya keep goin’ that way, you’ll run into the Mr. Shiteheed .”  He pointed an old, spotted finger in the direction Dan was heading.  “And he’ll stick ya in detention…. Better wait in the boys’ room for awhile.”  Mr. Total&eacute; Shiteheed was the school principal, a Frenchman, and quite a jerk in every conceivable way. <br />
<br />
          Dan nodded and smiled, “Thanks Joe…”   He was going to say that he owed Joe one, but then decided, Hey, why not pay him back now… he’s such a cool guy… he deserves better.   “Hey Joe?   Ever read fantasy books?”<br />
<br />
          Joe stopped a second, blinked a bit and nodded.   “Yeah, some…. Why?”<br />
<br />
          “What’s your favourite kind of fantasy creature… like what would you be if you could?”<br />
<br />
          He shrugged, “I kinda always liked elves… like that guy in Lord of the Rings with the blonde hair.”<br />
<br />
          Dan grinned… and watched as Joe’s wrinkles started to fade, the lines of age vanishing from his face, arms and hands.   Instead of stooping a bit like he usually did, Joe started standing straight up, his back cracking as it actually straightened, making Joe a bit taller.  Joe’s ears elongated until they had pointed tips, stretching backwards and upwards about an extra inch towards the top of his head.  His eyes started sparkling green like sapphires, and his clothing changed.   He had been wearing a brown, drab short-sleeved T-shirt and jeans.   Now, he was wearing a golden metallic thong-like covering over his crotch, silver shimmering boots, a long violet cloak that hung from his shoulders to his the back of his knees, and a golden crown, studded with diamonds, rubies, and jade.  He was shirtless, as that’s how Dan pictured every male in his head, and his chest was amazingly muscular, his stomach and abs formed into a perfect six-pack.   He looked like an Elven super hero.   “Have fun!” Dan said, as he slipped into the boys’ room.<br />
<br />
          Joe blinked, looked down at himself, “What the hell?” He spoke in perfect Queen’s English.  “What happened to me?”  He reached up and felt his ears, then the crown.  He took the crown off and gaped at it.  “Shit, I can sell this, and never have to work again!”   With that he just ran from the school, laughing musically, leaving his dirty mops and shit behind.<br />
<br />
          Dan went into a stall, realized he didn’t really have to take a leak, so he started jerking off instead, thinking about the swimming team boys.   Before he could get close to cumming, he heard a sound and zipped up, peeking through the crack in the stall, where the door connected to the aluminum mini-wall.<br />
<br />
          Two boys had come into the bathroom, one a tall redhead with braces, freckles and a permanent scowl, and the other was short and chubby, but with just the right muscles to punch noses extremely well.   They were the school bullies, Kay and Lan.  Kay, the tall one, was the ringleader, and Lan was the sidekick.  They both nearly always smelled like sewage, in summer, if left out in the middle of a sun-baked parking lot alongside fifty dead bunnies.  And, their clothes didn’t match.<br />
<br />
          Dan wrinkled his nose, then started to smirk.  Oh, I could have such fun with these two… always calling me faggot and fairy…   He grinned, unzipped his fly and let his still-hard-cock out again.   He started stroking it slowly as he opened the door, and grinned, leaning in the doorway, “Hey boys…. I bet you want to suck this don’t you?”<br />
<br />
          The bullies turned and growled at Dan, “What the…?   You friggin fairy!   I knew ya was a fag!” screeched the tall one, advancing on Dan like he was going to pound him into mush.  His compatriot laughed and nodded, “Faggot wants a blowjob!”<br />
<br />
          Dan winked at them, still stroking off.   Suddenly the boys stopped in their tracks, their clothing vanishing into thin air.  Their ears pointed, but not as nicely as Joe’s had, and their chests, arms, bellies and legs formed into nice-looking swimmer’s builds.   Large pink wings sprouted from their well-formed backs, and their cocks shrank into two little 1.5-inch hardons without balls.  Dan laughed, “Look at the cute little fairies!”  The bullies’ faces had turned adorably feminine and girlish, and their hair had bleached to platinum blonde.<br />
<br />
          Kay spoke first, his voice high and extremely flamey, “Oh my gawd… I’m so cute!   You’re so cute!  We’re….” he gasped and waved his arms, “all soooo cute!!!!   Thissss is faaaaaabulous !”  <br />
<br />
          Lan just licked his lips a bit and swallowed, staring at Dan’s cock.   “Hey sweetie… you think I could suck that for you?”<br />
<br />
          Dan laughed, still jerking off.   “Nah…. You fairies don’t do it good enough… I want a real man….. go play with each other.”   With that, he winked and put his cock away, zipping up and walking out of the room.<br />
<br />
          Lan frowned, pouting and started to sob, “I wanted the cock…”<br />
<br />
          Kay smiled and hugged Lan closely, “You can suck mine, sweetie..”<br />
<br />
          Lan smiled happily and nodded, fluttering his wings, “Oh, thank you!”   He kneeled down and took Kay’s teeny-weeny penis in his lips and started going to town on it.<br />
<br />
          Meanwhile, Dan had successfully evaded Mr. Shiteheed and headed into the pool area.   Fortunately, he was actually on time for this period, so the Coach had no idea anything special was up with Dan today.   Dan headed into the locker room with the other boys, put his backpack away, and started undressing, his cock, still hard, but today, he didn’t mind if anyone saw it.<br />
<br />
          Nick, the head of the swim team, a slim, lithe boy two years older than Dan, with small but firm pecs, and a perfectly flat stomach, with blue eyes an blonde hair, looked over at Dan, as Dan slipped his shorts off, blinking a bit at the boner.  Nick was white, but seemed to always find ways of keeping his skin nice and tanned.   He was mostly hairless on his body, except for a small trail of tiny, soft, blonde hairs that went from his pubes, past his navel, to the middle of his chest, and a soft coat of blonde hair on his lower arms.   Nick was actually the only boy on the team other than Dan whose locker was on this, the far side, of the locker room, behind another two rows of lockers.  Therefore, only Nick saw Dan’s stiffy.   “You look happy,” He chuckled, as he slipped his shoes and shirt off.<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled, turning and sitting on the small wooden bench, spreading his legs so Nick could get a good view of Dan’s raging hardon.  “Yeah… started something in the boys’ room and didn’t get to finish.”   Dan stroked himself slowly, watching Nick’s reaction.<br />
<br />
          Nick blinked and looked around, “Geez , Dan… don’t finish here, you’ll get in trouble…” Nick twisted his head around to see if anyone was coming their way, but there wasn’t.   He looked back at Dan’s cock, licked his lips a bit, then looked away, covering his crotch with his towel.   “Stop it…”<br />
<br />
          Dan blinked at Nick a bit, I haven’t done anything yet…. He… is he gay for real? He kept stroking his cock, standing and walking over to Nick.   “You like it, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
          Nick shook his head, breathing a bit faster.   “No… c’mon, you’ll get caught…”  He looked back at Dan and swallowed, eyes moving down over Dan’s chest and to his cock.  “Damn, man…. What’s got into you?”<br />
<br />
          Dan kept jerking slowly, his hand gently moving to pull the towel from Nick’s crotch.  He gave it a tug, and Nick looked at him, then let the towel fall, reveling his own shorts, tented in an obvious erection.  Dan smiled and reached out with his free hand to grasp the hard bulge through Nick’s shorts.  “I want to fuck you… that ok?”<br />
<br />
          Nick gasped, cock hardening more as Dan grabbed it.   “I… I.. aren’t you afraid we’ll get caught?”<br />
<br />
          Dan shook his head, reaching out to slide Nick’s shorts off, which Nick let him do.  “No, I got a way out of getting caught now…”  He smiled and rubbed his cock against Nick’s, taking them both in one hand and stroking them together, and rubbing his own precum all over Nick’s cock to slicken it up.<br />
<br />
          Nick moaned softly, putting his arms around Dan, speaking softly, “God, Dan… you don’t know how long I’ve wanted to… man, you are so cute….” He pulled Dan closer, nuzzling the side of his head, pressing his bare skin against Dan’s, their smooth chests pressing and rubbing together.<br />
<br />
          Dan sighed and hummed in pleasure, nuzzling Nick back and thrusting against him, jerking his and Nick’s cocks slowly and firmly, “I always thought you were cute too…. like a Faun… you know?   The way.. ohhh that feels good…. The way you’re thin and tanned and stuff… and sexy….”  He kissed Nick’s neck, just below the earlobe.<br />
<br />
          “Oh yes…” Nick whisper-moaned into Dan’s ear as he thrusted back against Dan, his cock flowing with precum.  “I… remember reading… ohh.. about those… in history…. Myths and stuff… oh, Dan .. you rock…. I kinda thought they were sexy…”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled, jerking Nick’s cock a bit harder, licking up Nick’s neck from below his earlobe to his ear, where he whispered, hot breath against Nick’s moist skin, “Wish you could turn into one?”<br />
<br />
          Nick moaned and shivered, pulling Dan closer with all the attention, “Yeah….. ohhhh that would be soo hot… and they got big dicks too, don’t they?”  Nick’s dick was already 7 inches long, as it stood… and it was standing pretty stiff right now.<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled brightly, then moved to kiss Nick on the lips as he stroked their cocks faster, his other hand caressing Nick’s back, shoulder, and the hairs on his arm.   Your wish is my command, he thought.<br />
<br />
          Nick kissed Dan back deeply, lost in pleasure, not realizing what was now happening to him.  First, his dick grew longer and thicker, becoming a full 9 inches long, and growing a foreskin, with a furry sheath-like base and ball-sac.   From his balls, the fur spread, white thick fur, down his legs and around to his butt, where a little deer-tail sprouted just above his hole.   His feet shrank and became deer-hooves, and small antlers popped from two points on his forehead and grew to about 6 inches in length.<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled and broke the kiss, then started to bend his knees, kissing and licking down the center of Nick’s chest, pausing to lick and kiss each perky nipple, before kissing the rest of the way down, licking in his navel, then down again, to his balls.   Dan licked at Nick’s furry balls a bit, before giving the Faun a long lick from the base of his shaft, all the way to the tip.<br />
<br />
          Nick shivered and moaned, clutching at and caressing Dan’s shoulders as he’s kissed and licked.  He let out a long, un-controllable moan as his long shaft was licked, his tip leaking tones of sweet precum.   He caught a glimpse of his legs as he watched Dan prepare to go down on him, and blinked, then smirked and giggled, “Oh man, that explains it.. it’s a fucking dream… damn.. wish I could have you for real, Dan…”<br />
<br />
          Dan chuckled just a bit before taking the massive cock into his mouth.  He licked all around the head before placing his tongue flat on the underside of the tip.   He pressed his lips tightly around Nick’s cock and started sliding up and down, though not able to take it all.   His tongue slid up and down the underside of the sensitive tip and shaft, as his lips bobbed up and down on the cock.   Since he couldn’t take it all, Dan continued to stroke the remainder of the shaft with his hand, in time with his sucking.<br />
<br />
          Nick gasped as his cock was taken, licked, stroked and sucked.   “Fuck… god… Dan.. ohhhhh you are sooooo fucking awesome!” he called out, thinking this a dream, and therefore not caring if anyone heard.<br />
<br />
          Dan really didn’t care either, but for other reasons.   He was prepared if anyone came around that corner and saw, which was a good thing.  <br />
<br />
          Because, right at that moment, the Coach came in and looked at them, gaping.  “What the hell are you boys doing???”<br />
<br />
          Dan just kept on sucking, as he waved a finger in the Coach’s direction.<br />
<br />
          Suddenly, where the Coach had been, now floated a tiny pixie, nothing more than a blob of light with wings.  It flew off in a random direction.<br />
<br />
          Nick chuckled, “This…. Ohh… is some… ohhhh man, yeah, just like that….. weird dream….”<br />
<br />
          Dan sucked and jerked faster, playing with Nick’s furry balls and licking the massive tip.<br />
<br />
          Nick gasped and thrusted into Dan’s mouth, spurting gob after gob of thick sweet Faun cum, his back arching and his head going back.   “Ohhhh Dan!”<br />
<br />
          Dan sucked and sucked, milking as much cum as he could get from the sexy Faun, savoring the sweet taste and drinking it like milk.<br />
<br />
          Nick spurted and spurted until he was finally spent, then slid his cock from Dan’s lips and smiled down to him, “ Fuck, that was awesome… now it’s your turn…. I gotta act like a Faun, right?”  He winked and lifted Dan gently by his shoulders, so that he was standing.   Then he kissed Dan on the lips, nipples and chest, before diving down on Dan’s cock, taking it into his mouth and sucking hard, licking it all over and bobbing quickly, as if cock was the only thing in the world Nick wanted.<br />
<br />
          Dan gasped and called out, “Yeah!!   Oh Nick!!” as his cock was so energetically pleasured by the new Faun.  “Suck it, oh gods… by Pan, Nick!!!”<br />
<br />
          Nick sucked and sucked, licking up and down Dan’s cock, then taking it in mouth again, taking it all the way in, down to the base of Dan’s shaft, then all the way back up to the tip on every bob of his antlered-head.<br />
<br />
          Dan moaned and thusted, starting to hump into the Faun’s mouth, his hands on Nick’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
          Nick sucked and sucked, massaging Dan’s balls and feeling them draw up.<br />
<br />
          Dan gasped and his toes curled, holding Nick closer as he climaxed, shooting thick wads of cum deep into the Faun’s throat.<br />
<br />
          Nick hummed and tasted it, then swallowed it, drinking the cum happily, milking as much as he could get by stroking the shaft in time with the spurts.<br />
<br />
          Dan stopped after a few seconds then sighed happily, pulling out from Nick’s lips and plopping down on the bench.   “Gods, that was soooo cool… thanks!”<br />
<br />
          Nick smiled, stood and went to Dan, then sat by him, putting an arm around him, reveling in the touch of his bare skin against Dan’s, holding him close, and looking into his eyes.   “I’ve always wanted you Dan… ever since you first joined the team.”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled warmly, leaning forward and kissing the Faun.   “I wish you’d told me.”<br />
<br />
          Nick kissed Dan and smiled, “Yeah.. so do I… but I don’t know if your even gay in real life.”<br />
<br />
          Dan chuckled, “Oh, you still think this is a dream….”<br />
<br />
          Nick grinned, looking down at his furry legs, and feeling his horns with the hand not around Dan.  “It has to be.”<br />
<br />
          Dan shook his head, “It’s not.” He winked.   “And I’ll prove it.”<br />
<br />
          Nick tilted his head curiously, like a deer might.   “How?”<br />
<br />
          “Just wait.. hang out with me all day, and you’ll remember it all tomorrow.   Do you want all of this to be real?   You as a faun, and me and you…. Having sex?”<br />
<br />
          “Fuck yeah!  Being a Faun is great!  I feel wonderful…. Like I could get hard right now and cum and cum… and pleasure you all day and night… and god, Dan, of course I want to have sex with you, over and over.  I really like you.”<br />
<br />
          “What about your parents and school and all?”<br />
<br />
          Nick shrugged, “I don’t care.   It’d be weird to explain, but whatever.   I’d give up my family and school, to feel like this forever.”<br />
<br />
          Dan blinked, “Really?”<br />
<br />
          Nick nodded.  “Yeah… and like right now, I feel like all I want to do is make love to you, over and over…  who cares about anything else?”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled, blinking and realizing something.   That’s the difference… shit, I should have thought of that.  Satyrs were wild, untamed, creatures of the woods…. Fauns were the ones that courted and fell in love… they’re more like the Cernunnos side of Pan.  Ian ran away because I made him wild…. But Nick will stay.   “Do… you want to be my boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
          Nick gasped and smiled, nodding happily.   “Yes! I’d love that!”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled brightly and hugged Nick tight, “Cool… then we can be boyfriends.  I’ve always wanted a boyfriend like you…. Hey… want to watch me change the swimming team to mermen?”<br />
<br />
          Nick hugged Dan back, snuggling him tightly and caressing Dan’s bare skin with his own.  “Sure, hon, I’d love that.”<br />
<br />
          Dan grinned, today was looking better and better….</p>
