<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan was pissed off as he tore through his sister&#39;s room. She was on break which meant she was home from college for the summer, but it also meant more trouble for Dylan. He was nearly 16 now but still had to deal with being the &quot;baby&quot; of the family. It was usually fine most of the year, but whenever his bratty sister came home he wouldn&#39;t stop being treated as the younger sibling.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, Emily&#39;s such a freaking know it all.&quot; He thought as he started to reach under her bed. &quot;I just KNOW that she put my cleats in here because it was &quot;better&quot; or some bull like that.&quot; He mumbled as he felt something on his thumb.<br />
<br />
He reached in and pulled out the box with his cleats in them, but also stuck ti the box slightly which he accidentally pulled out was some odd looking camera thing. Dylan flipped it around and figured it was one of those really old ones which could actually give you the picture right away and wasn&#39;t digital at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh man, I bet this was some old stuff of dad&#39;s or mom&#39;s that she stashed away for herself.&quot; He guessed with a chuckle. &quot;She&#39;ll be in so much trouble when they get home, and finally little miss perfect will get a bit of trouble. I wonder if it still even works though?&quot; He thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He checked his phone quick to make sure his buddy Rob wasn&#39;t there yet. He also checked the time and figured he&#39;d have enough time to mess around with it. &quot;Alright, one selfie wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot; He chuckled, aiming the camera towards himself and smiled as he snapped a pic.<br />
<br />
                                                                                ________________________________________<br />
&quot;You sure it&#39;s safe just laying under your bed?&quot; Rick asked in between sips of coffee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Emily sighed, staring off into the local starbucks. &quot;No one would ever look under there so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine...&quot; She trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;But? Something is clearly still bothering you.&quot; Rick asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... babe it&#39;s this camera! Like, I know it&#39;s dangerous and all, but I feel like we&#39;re waisting potential by just leaving it where it is forever.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I gotcha... I feel that a bit too. But, like you said, it alters reality itself! You switched it so that it&#39;s currently only us aware, but you still fear it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Rick! What if it got switched off accidentally while we were transformed? We could be stuck as completely altered people and no-one would ever know! We gotta keep it safe... but maybe we could use it a tad here and there you know?&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I-&quot; Rick started before a sudden wave hit them. They both stared at each other in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, someone&#39;s using the camera!&quot; Rick gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, MOVE.&quot; Emily said as the two got up towards the car. &quot;They won&#39;t be aware, so the longer whoever it is has the camera the harder it&#39;ll be to fix!&quot; She yelled as the couple drove off back home.<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s not half bad...&quot; Dana chuckled to herself. She had taken a pretty cute picture with the camera she found in her bitch of a sister&#39;s room. She stared at it with a smile, enthralled in her own beauty. Her busty breasts, her cute styled brunette bob, her kissable lips, she couldn&#39;t help but love herself!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah Dana, this is why Robby loves to plow you every night.&quot; She giggled, before being interrupted by a text.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh poo, Rob&#39;ll be here any second.&quot; She whined. &quot;I don&#39;t even wanna go to cheer practice today.&quot; She groaned. She got up and started walking for the door when she glanced back at the camera. If she was still Dylan, she would&#39;ve kept walking, but her new found vanity drew her back.<br />
&quot;Oooh, I can&#39;t help it!&quot; She squealed. &quot;I just adore this little thing! I can&#39;t believe Em was hiding this from me... just one more snap!&quot; She laughed striking another pose. <br />
<br />
This time, she vanished from Emily&#39;s room, appearing back in her own. She only stood there frozen for a moment before the walls changed around her. In the blink of an eye, the teenaged girl&#39;s room morphed into a prim nursery with bubbly pink heart filled wallpaper, stuffed animals and a changing station all around. Dana regressed in age till a one year old baby girl plopped into her crib, sticking part of the camera in her mouth happily.<br />
<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
&quot;Did you just feel that?&quot; Rick asked a very stressed out Emily. <br />
<br />
He glanced over at her in the passenger&#39;s seat and noticed she was staring at her phone. He didn&#39;t&#39;t get too good of a glance before he looked back to the frustratingly long red light, but he could tell it was a photo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, my camera roll is changing.&quot; Emily sighed. &quot;But, I think I know who&#39;s using it right now.... my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit seriously?&quot; Rick sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, though I think his change so far is punishment enough.&quot; She smirked looking at a photo of her holding her new baby sister. &quot;We just gotta hope we can get back and snatch it back before anyone else gets involved.<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
&quot;Dana, honey what do you have in your mouth?&quot; Emily&#39;s mother Olivia yelled as she walked into her baby girl&#39;s nursery. She waltzed in and pulled what looked to be a large polaroid camera out of her hands. She held it loosely as it was slightly covered in baby slobber. She was going to start looking it over to see who it belonged to when her daughter started to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey I&#39;m sorry but this isn&#39;t a toy.&quot; She said calmly, picking up the baby to rock her. <br />
<br />
Dana quickly calmed down, and suddenly lost the camera from her vision upon seeing her stuffed bear in her crib.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s a good girl go play with Mr. Fuzzy.&quot; Olivia laughed, gently placing her down again. She walked back to the cabinet where hs had placed the camera. After using some baby wipes to clean it up, she held it up towards herself. It looked like a standard polaroid she would&#39;ve seen used back in the day, but how did the baby get this? She was going to just throw it out, but figured it&#39;d be a waste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I suppose I should see if it works first.&quot; She thought aloud. <br />
<br />
She turned towards the large mirror in Dana&#39;s room and looked herself over. She was getting old, bust still thought she was hot for her age. Her wavy black hair was still jet black and her breasts were still pretty large. She think&#39;s she&#39;s what the kids would call, a &quot;MILF.&quot; But time was still moving and she definitely felt older. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see.&quot; She thought, snapping a picture of her reflection.<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
&quot;Okay we&#39;re almost there.&quot; Rick said as he turned off towards Emily&#39;s block. &quot;Did you notice any other ch-oh my god.&quot; Rick gasped.<br />
<br />
Emily had changed. Her usually straight brunette hair was now curly and deep black, tied in a tight bun. Her pale skin had become closer to caramel in color, and her breasts were nearly twice the size. Her fashion changed slightly, but only to make her blouse looser and with more jewelry. Emily was staring at her reflection in awe.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her phone and saw that her family portrait showed her father Paul was still white, but her mother was clearly African-American, making her half black. She stared back up at Rick with a worried expression.<br />
&quot;Rick, if whoever has the camera keeps changing my mother, I could cease to exist if too big of a change happens.&quot; She replied. &quot;Just promise me you&#39;ll do your best to fix this.&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise babe but it&#39;s not gonna come to that we&#39;re right here.&quot; He replied, quickly pulling up to the sidewalk in font of Emily&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
&quot;Hmm, not bad.&quot; Olivia smiled at her photo that printed. &quot;Look Dana, isn&#39;t this a nice photo of mommy?&quot; She asked showing her much curlier haired baby the photo.<br />
<br />
Dana was too busy sucking her toes, so Olivia just laughed. She put the photo on the dresser and glanced at the camera again.<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t half bad, but I think I still need to check it out more. Sometimes these things had trouble with too much light.&quot; She thought aloud.<br />
<br />
As if by fate, she noticed a car pull up outside. She looked out the window and saw that Rick and Emily were back from Starbucks. She smiled, figuring she could test out the camera by getting a cute picture of the couple. As they walked inside she snapped a photo.<br />
<br />
                                                                               ________________________________________<br />
Rick and Emily were hustling inside when they spotted the changed Olivia inside, readying herself to take a picture of them. With little time, Rick managed to turn his body so that he blocked Emily.<br />
&quot;You got this Emily I trust you.&quot; He said before the light flashed around him. </p>

Emily could only stare as her boyfriend transformed, but into what?</h3>
