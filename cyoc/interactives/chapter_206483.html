<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I put away the groceries and then headed to my room. Texting Sam on the way up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Logging back on, you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still just seen. He&#39;s probably busy playing and trying to escape. I slip on the headset, start up the systems, and find my avatar still in the caverns. The menu opens and I check on the status of my Lycanthropy.... Still stage 1, still an hour. Looks like it doesn&#39;t tick while I&#39;m offline, that&#39;s good at least.<br />
<br />
But Sam&#39;s no where to be found, and I can&#39;t just wait here and do nothing. The connected passages are empty right now, and I can&#39;t hear anything further down. But it&#39;s a maze of pathways, I would just be guessing where each entrance leads. It&#39;s better than nothing, so I leave the starting room and turn right. Then take the first left, then straight, then right. I hope I&#39;m making progress, but everything looks the same. <br />
<br />
Another five minutes pass as I wander through this maze. Hearing the distant sound of fighting as I start to speed up. Maybe it&#39;s Sam? Or at least another human whose trying to break free. The sound leads me to a opening blocked by metal bars. I can still peak through to the other side, seeing the natural sunlight illuminating this part of the cave. It has to be near the exit, I look for the way out from here. My view blocked by an ongoing fight.<br />
<br />
Several werewolves lay unconcious on the ground. In front of them is Sam, and infront of him is Mugrel. I want to call out, but I would only be distracting him from the fight and alerting the wolves to my presence. Plus... Sam looks really bad. <br />
<br />
There&#39;s scratch and bite marks all across his burly body. Blood dripping from the wounds, and his breaths heavy. His beard is longer and his body taller, did he get even older? I can spot grey hairs in his beard, and his voice is rougher than I&#39;m used to. But what concerned me more than the wounds was the physical changes I saw. His hands were claws, paw pads holding onto his greataxe. His knees were pressed forward, digitigrade now with brown furs covering the area. A healthy pelt having taking over the middle of his pecs. His hair was a mess, longer than I remembered and connecting to his full beard. What made all of this worse for me was the expression Sam was making. He looked almost feral.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re done, pup.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut up! I&#39;m almost out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mugrel has an evil smirk, arms resting against his barrel of a chest. The werewolf stepping aside, letting Sam just up and leave. The barbarian keeping his axe pointed at the beast the entire time, backing away slowly then breaking into full sprint. He was out!<br />
<br />
A loud howl reverberates throughout the cavern. Mugrels muzzle pointed to the roof, calling to his pack, and Sam answers the call. The broad human marching straight into Mugrels clutches, tossing away his axe and switching to all fours as he presses his head against the monsters chest. Sam... No you need to resist...<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, pup. You belong to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fur starts to climb over Sam&#39;s form. Inching itself over his skin at a painfully slow rate. His head rubbing against the alphas chest, pressing against the beasts soft fur as a claw gently scratches the bottom of his chin. The barbarian getting hard under his loincloth, looking up to his new master with pure awe. Mugrels grip tightening, as he shoves the new recruit under his armpit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Learn your alphas scent, pup!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam let&#39;s out an involuntary yelp from the force, then gives in to the new orders. Rubbing himself against the monsters underarm, taking in deep whiffs of his primitive scent. Head pressing forward, mouth becoming a muzzle. Nose vanishing to a black dot. Ears standing up tall as they are covered in fur. Entire visage now matching that of a wolf, as Mugrel throws him back, and Sam drops to the ground with tongue lolling out of his mouth. Chest rising and falling as he takes deep pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. Learn your alphas might!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s cock has broken free from his loincloth. Large dick standing tall against his chest, as he climbs to all fours. Arms already claws, and legs now shifting to their new lupine form. Paw pads covering the bottom, fur protecting the skin from the caves cool air. The changing man grasping his alphas left arm with one claw. Mugrel flexing, biceps straining for Sam&#39;s delight. The newcomer&#39;s hands roaming next to his chest, feeling his large pecs and barrel of a gut. Unable to discern the muscle definition underneath, but able to tell that he is the strongest werewolf in this cave. Sam&#39;s own burly chest almost all completely hidden in fur by now. Body still chiseled enough for his tight abs and six pack to be visible despite the new covering.<br />
<br />
My friend is almost a full werewolf by now. Every piece of him has been taken over by this new fur, his body wild in appearance, and head indiscernible from a wolf&#39;s. Tail now pressing out, currently still as he rests his hands against Mugrels chest, looking his alpha in the eyes and waiting for his next order. Which the alpha is happy to give, as I spot a lupine cock poking free from his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, you will learn your alpha&#39;s love, pup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s tail starts to quickly wag. He goes onto all fours and offers himself to his creator, the alpha climbing on-top of his newest conquest. The tip of his dick pressing against the new werewolf&#39;s ass, slowly dug inside as more of his cock frees itself from the sheath. Shoving in all including the knot, as Sam stoically takes all for his master. Letting Mugrel claim him, as his own cock hides away in a newly formed sheath. Before his newly reformed member pushes free. Inflating and enlarging as his own knot presses against his furred chest. Mugrel starts slowly pressing into Sam as the barbarian lets out a quiet groan. The alpha bringing a hand around the other werewolf, stroking the tip of Sam&#39;s cock as he pounds his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like this, pup?&quot;<br />
&quot;Rrrggh. Yes alpha! It feels amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam expresses pure delight as he is treated to the best experience in his life. Letting his new alpha fully indoctrinate him into the pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. You are an older, stronger wolf. Aren&#39;t you my pup?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! I am!&quot;<br />
&quot;You are mine, aren&#39;t you, pup?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! I am yours!&quot;<br />
&quot;Inside and outside this game, you are a werewolf, and you are mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;No matter where I am, I belong to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s cock starts to leak as Mugrel continues to stroke it. The pre sinking into his fur, as he begins to involuntarily buck against his master. Held still as the stronger werewolf gently bites against the scruff of his inferiors neck. Reinforcing the status quo between them, and claiming complete control. More juices spilling out of the recruits cock as he howls in climax, his stomach covered in his own cum as his balls empty. Mugrel keeping the same position for another minute, before letting go of Sam and starting his own deep howl. The alpha giving his newest subject their fill, before forcing his knot out of the smaller beasts ass. Claw gripping onto his inferiors neck, as he directs his subordinate to lap up the last drips of spunk from his cock. Which Sam happily does, licking up the last drops, before stretching and standing tall next to his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure your friend succumbs to the same fate, pup.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to miss out on this!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was horrified. My best friend, my boyfriend, just got fucked by a werewolf in front of me. He just became a monster. I didn&#39;t even think that this was just a video game. Too shocked as I pondered what to do. I... Could I really be happy leaving Sam alone here? No. A part of me knew I needed to get out.<br />
<br />
I stepped away, my steps awkward as I looked down to my own raging erection. Did... Did that make me hard? I scratched my chin, feeling more hairs greeting me. My hand then running through my chest to find new muscle. Was i still getting older and stronger? What&#39;s happening to me? I opened the menu and saw the status.<br />
