<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;N-nnghaaa!?&quot; James&#39;s throat closed on him, leaving out a strangled squeak as he pushed himself back, onto Jess&#39;s designated bed.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyes flew open; confusion, shame, then fear flashed through her eyes in rapid succession. She shot up straight, dangling tits slapping loudly against her upper stomach.<br />
<br />
Only now did James register their existence. &quot;W-what the fuck!?&quot; he stammered, finger pointing accusingly. Jess&#39;s eyes shot wide, and her face flushed in mortification. This was all wrong. He was trying to seduce her. &quot;Y-you, you were the one wanted to see them! You wanted to see my tits! You said Melissa was fine with it?&quot;. She countered, forcefully, angry now. How dare he reel her in like this. Make her feel like a total and utter fool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I...? I thought you had booze? And here you are coming on to me like some sicko freak!&quot; James half-shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Booze?&quot; Jess whispered, *Oh no...* she thought. Feeling very exposed her hands went to cover her pillowy breasts. It was a pathetic attempt really, her hands were getting lost in them. She did manage to cover her nipples at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah booze!&quot; James insisted, &quot;What would make you think I wanted to feel you up...?&quot; He paused, looked at his hands, realisation struck. &quot;Oh God, I touched them! Eww!&quot;. He began wiping his hands on his jumper. &quot;You&#39;re sick Jess! That&#39;s so messed up. What the fuck is going on with your tits!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears were beginning to well in Jess&#39;s eyes, but quicker than tears, her anger was rising. She had had enough, all she wanted to do was warn her brother. She didn&#39;t mean for any of this to happen, it was just this place, it was messing with her; and there James sat, making fun of her for it. Well fuck him.<br />
<br />
Jess saw red.<br />
<br />
Finishing his wiping, James turned up in time to see Jess&#39;s face curl into a face of rage and disgust, her arms returned to her side, breasts falling free again, fists curling. &quot;J-Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a furious roar Jess launched herself at James, hands outstretched, catching him with all of her weight in his chest.<br />
<br />
Unprepared, James upper half flew back on the bed, head hitting the mattress. The back of his head connected with something hard under the blanket that sent the stars spinning and bright lights flashing.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s body reared back, having bounced off her brother. Her breasts swung out in front of her until her backward motion stopped long enough for momentum to swing them back with a meaty *slap*. The hit was heavy enough to stagger her, and the sound loud enough for a slightly dazed James to raise his head. &quot;Big, tits?&quot; He managed to croak out, dazed.<br />
<br />
Jess anger was still flaring. Blood thumping in her head. &quot;I just wanted to help you.&quot; She growled, between grinding teeth.<br />
<br />
Still dazed, a puzzled James countered, &quot;Help me with big tits?&quot;.<br />
<br />
That was it. If steam could come out someone&#39;s ear, it would have been flying out of Jess&#39;s at this stage. &quot;Oh I&#39;ll help you with big tits, you asshole...&quot;<br />
<br />
She launched herself again, catching him as he began to rise. Again James fell back, once again connecting with the hard object under the blanket. The second strike in rapid succession was enough to fully daze him.<br />
<br />
This time Jess&#39;s momentum had carried her forward landing on her brother. Heaving breasts were now squashed between her and him.<br />
<br />
James began feebly slapping her side, &quot;Tits...&quot; He mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh tits is it!? Tits you want!? Tits can be arranged brother dear...&quot;. Fuming, Jess mounted the bed, one knee either side of him, straddling his prone form. No idea that he was quite as dazed as he was she leaned forward and lowered her dangling watermelons over his face. She caught the puzzled look and &quot;Huh?&quot; before she dropped them over his face, muffling his startled cries.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t enough, not now that her blood was up. Jess began rocking her body side to side, reverse motor-boating James. &quot;Oh you think it&#39;s sick eh!? Don&#39;t want to touch them? Have a face-full you prick.&quot; She spat.<br />
<br />
James was rallying incredibly slowly. He knew Jess was angry, something about big tits. <br />
<br />
*Ugh*<br />
<br />
The back of his head throbbed, it was bad. But there was competing sensory input, and a warm squishy feeling on his face, and on his lap a nice pressure. Warm. Comforting. Nice. It felt good. Jess? Something to do with Jess? <br />
It felt damn good... <br />
Hadn&#39;t felt this nice in a long time. Not since Melissa.<br />
<br />
Jess froze as her brother bucked under her, his hip rising and falling once.<br />
<br />
Did she? *No way* she thought. A scowl replaced the incredulous look on her face. Her hand drifted back behind her.<br />
<br />
James, still lost in a world of warmth and softness and good feelings, felt something grab his hardened member though his pants. A muffled voice reached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh who&#39;s the sicko freak now??? After all that, hard for your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hard for his sister? James thought. What was Jess doing here? Jess didn&#39;t have big tits?<br />
Only... She did now? Was this Jess making him feel good? It did feel really nice. Couldn&#39;t be Jess though. Must be some not-Jess person.<br />
<br />
James&#39;s mind was at war. He felt not-Jess stroke up and down on his shaft through the tight fabric. Jess or not-Jess, he wanted more. He bucked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Now you want it!? Well. Let me show you then what I was warning you about!&quot;. He heard the voice call. It sounded more like Jess every moment. Neurons firing faster and faster. Then, all of a sudden his world came back into view.<br />
<br />
*GASP* James took a lungful of fresh air as Jess heaved her breasts from his face. James barely had time to register the furious look of his sister&#39;s face behind the looming twin peaks of her hanging tits before it disappeared again, after a moment, her pale skinny back and shoulders came into view.<br />
<br />
Swinging around, Jess shifted position, riding James&#39;s chest cowgirl style. Wasting no time she slipped open his belt, unbuckled his pants, and slipped her hand underneath his underwear.<br />
<br />
Her hand burned at the feeling of James. She had never held one before, her rage had driven her this far. But now that it was in her hand, she felt wholly inadequate to handle it. She began to deflate a little.<br />
<br />
For James&#39;s part, air filling his lungs he was back to mostly firing on all cylinders. Only now, it was different. He had felt what he had felt. He still felt it. This felt nice. Jess was making him feel nice. It was wrong, he had been surprised previously. Maybe it would be okay. She did want it.<br />
Maybe. <br />
He could risk it. He was so horny. <br />
<br />
But his sister.<br />
<br />
But she had wanted it. And now, maybe he wanted it.<br />
<br />
Maybe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess!&quot; he called softly. She turned. Face no longer hard. It was soft looking. It wasn&#39;t a bad face. She had sparkling eyes and ruby red lips, with a button nose, freckles dancing on it. He always liked that. Freckles looked nice on a girl.<br />
<br />
She looked expectant. <br />
<br />
Maybe...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, please!&quot; He moaned, needily, he bit his lip.<br />
<br />
She nodded, shakily, and turned back. He felt a tug at his pants. Jess&#39;s other hand was trying to pull his pants down, to free him. Maybe he should let her.<br />
<br />
He raised his hips, pushing up. She rose to her knees to allow him to do so and began pulling at his pants. It caught underneath him. She gave it a good tug and pulled it free allowing his member to pop-out, bobbing in the air. It wasn&#39;t the only thing that was free...<br />
<br />
James had felt the pants catch on his tail, only then remembering its existence, and was too slow to stop Jess from pulling it free. <br />
<br />
Oh God he thought. How would he explain this. &quot;Jess it&#39;s not...&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t get very far before Jess stopped him by softly saying. &quot;So you *do* have a horse tail.&quot; <br />
<br />
How could she have known? There was a pregnant pause. Jess&#39;s hands went to her side. Still not turning to look at him<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; She whispered. Her thumbs looped into her waist band and pulled it down at the back. James gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one too. A cow&#39;s...&quot;. As the waistband came down, enough to reveal a fleshy tail squashed between her butt-cheeks. Gently and with a sigh of relief she pulled it free, unfurling it from its confine. <br />
<br />
As it came free she draped it back, across James&#39;s chest and past his face. Turning he could see the auburn furry tip. <br />
<br />
It felt hot across his chest. Slowly his hands came up to touch it. It was warm, soft, yet hard underneath. He stroked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;James...&quot; Jess moaned. She liked this. That was wrong. Maybe he should continue. Maybe he would...<br />
<br />
He stroked it again. It was warm. This close he could smell his sister too. It smelled good. Familiar. Safe.<br />
<br />
His hands drifted up. Fingertips trailing all over it. Marvelling at it. It was really connected to her. <br />
<br />
His hands ran to the interface, trailing from tail to lower back on the upper side. Jess shivered as he did so.<br />
<br />
She looked down, James&#39;s penis was straining hard, purple mushroom head swollen and glistening. It looked as ripe as a juicy apple. She wanted a taste. <br />
<br />
Holding it in her hand, she lowered her head until she was only an inch away. She could feel the heat rising from it. She could smell it. <br />
<br />
&quot;James.&quot; she called softly, hot breath tickling his shaft.<br />
<br />
James, for his part was slightly distracted. As his sister leaned forward, her body folding over, breasts resting on his stomach and her ass pushed back, cheeks spreading as it did. Her tail flicked, whipping past his head before landing on top of it. Giving him a full, close-up, view of his sister&#39;s pink rosebud.<br />
<br />
&quot;James&quot; she called again. This time he responded. &quot;Jess...&quot; His breath tickling her asshole. <br />
<br />
&quot;James, we can&#39;t finish okay... We can&#39;t finish...&quot; She repeated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay..&quot; He breathed. He wasn&#39;t allowed finish. He was enthralled by Jess asshole. Melissa&#39;s was all dark, it looked dirty, even though he knew it wasn&#39;t. It was just never appetising. But Jess&#39;s, but his sister&#39;s. Her skin was so pale, totally unblemished, and then a perfect juicy pink ring. Maybe he could just... <br />
Just kiss his sister... Maybe...<br />
<br />
James leaned forward, lips puckered and planted a quick kiss on her wonderful rosebud.<br />
<br />
Jess moaned with delight. &quot;James. Yes..&quot;. and closed the distance with James&#39;s penis, wrapping her mouth around it. Taking the warm bulb into her.<br />
<br />
The feeling of Jess mouth around him was heaven. James, in gratitude and in want grabbed his sister by the flanks and drove his face forward again. This time his tongue flashed out, wide, licking her from bottom to top. He didn&#39;t expect it, but the taste was fantastic. Clean, skin taste mostly, with a small bit of must. Jess&#39;s squealing vibrating on his dick told him that she liked it.<br />
<br />
He licked again. She squealed again. It was a good game. On and on he licked. He slobbered. He rolled his tongue around her rosebud, until Jess&#39;s squealing became moaning. The vibrations from her moaning, at a lower pitch, upped his pleasure. He could see Jess ass pulsing, invitingly.<br />
<br />
Jess, under sensory overload, suckling on a delicious flesh lollipop, was wholly unprepared when James&#39;s tongue tip penetrated her ass. Her eyes shot open, but she did not stop. <br />
<br />
That was good. Too good.<br />
<br />
One hand snaked down below her breasts to her stomach and ran flat against the skin there. Sure enough she felt the extra nipples. Not just bumps though. Her hand ran across four thumb length teats, each bending and stiffening under her touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wames, we cank finish...&quot; she called, not taking his dick from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okah&quot; He replied, tongue firmly in her ass. James though, had no intention of stopping. It was like a floodgates had opened. He needed relief. His face burned. His ears especially, burned red hot. He could feel himself bubbling. He wanted this. He wanted this for Jess... He wanted Jess right now.<br />
<br />
Feeling James go at it with gusto, Jess gasped, hands flying over her growing teats, flicking them. It felt damn good.<br />
<br />
&quot;We cank Wames, we cank!&quot; She repeated. She was getting closer. She could feel James pulsing, he was close. She knew it. Yet she didn&#39;t pull away. &quot;Wames I hawv koo skop!&quot; she pleaded<br />
<br />
James pulled back. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare.&quot; He growled before he hungrily dived back in.<br />
<br />
Jess moaned in frustration, and kept bobbing and swirling her tongue. I was only moments until James grunted into her ass, and Jess shut her eyes in defeat as James&#39;s dick began to jump in her mouth. <br />
<br />
The first pulse was only a warning, the second jump released a jet of seed. Salty slimy cum coated the roof off Jess&#39;s mouth. Shocked at the taste and the feel she pulled back, releasing James&#39;s cock. Just in time to get the third shot straight into the face, the warm slimy feel and acrid smell assaulting her senses. She pulled back further to get shots three, four and five all over her enormous tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to stop&quot; She moaned, feeling gloriously sexy, having finally had an interaction with a man. Driving him to orgasm. One hand began rubbing the cum all over her breasts, relishing the slimy feel on her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must stop&quot; she whined again. Other hand dancing over her stiffened teats, dancing, twisting, pulling. She was so close. This was a reward, she earned a good cum for finally getting with a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnnghh. Stop Jess. I have to stop!&quot; She called one last time, even as her lower hand snaked under the front of her waistband, making contact with her very swollen labia and engorged clit. That was enough. And she knew as she began kneading that she was making a huge mistake. That she was giving in, fully knowing the consequences. And that terrified her.<br />
<br />
A warbling cry as Jess sagged. earth-shattering orgasm over as she whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; She whispered, deflated, as her hands ran over the four quickly drooping teats sticking from her lower belly. They were here to stay.<br />
<br />
Only then did she feel the panicked slapping on her thighs and ass.<br />
<br />
In sitting up she had covered James fully, sitting on his face. She leapt up turning and gasped. Poking from the top of James&#39;s red and panting face was a pair of gray ears. Long ears, horse ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh James. I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; she called out, hand extending.<br />
<br />
James for his part, looked horrified again. &quot;Melissa!? Oh God&quot; he breathed. Jess&#39;s hand made contact with his face. Gentle. Loving. <br />
<br />
What had he done. He had betrayed his girlfriend. Stomach sinking to a pit he felt nauseous. He had to get away. He slapped away his sister&#39;s hand, leaving her shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t touch me!&quot; he snapped. Hand moving to where she touched him. It came in contact with fur. Eyes wide it ran up the length of the ear. The  quickly across to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; James said, at no-one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain James.&quot; James looked at his sister, a bit of cum dangled and jiggled from her chin as she talked. A bit of his cum. He felt sick again. <br />
He had cheated on Melissa. He needed to get away from Jess. He couldn&#39;t look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Leave me a alone Jess...&quot; He stood up, pushing her off. She landed on the bed, knocked flat by her breasts. She called for her brother. But he just stormed off, to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. He needed to be alone.<br />
<br />
Left behind in the bedroom, Jess sat up. Head sinking into her hands.<br />
<br />
This had not gone to plan.</p>
