<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later than evening, there was a knock on the door. Josh opened the <br />
door and his old hunting buddy, Jim, was there. Jim was a little <br />
younger than Josh at 35 years old stood about 6 feet, 2 inches tall, <br />
had a 4-week hunting beard growing nice and thick. Jim said, &quot;I <br />
thought I'd drop off some of my gear for tomorrow's hunt, if that's <br />
ok, so we don't have to hassle with it in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot;, Josh replied, looking into Jim's eyes. He had never <br />
noticed what strikingly piercing eyes Jim had. I felt a wave of warmth <br />
come over him in Jim's presence and he knew he had to have him. But <br />
shit, Jim was straight. Had been married for 5 years but just got <br />
divorced. Why hadn't he felt this way before? Odd.<br />
<br />
As Jim was unloading the equipment, Josh hastily walked over to Ty and <br />
whispered, &quot;Hey, you think you could make Jim gay with your powers? Is <br />
that even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty replied, &quot;Yes of course it is!&quot;, wondering why Josh would ask such <br />
a stupid question. Then he remembered that he made Josh forget he had <br />
been transformed to a complete homosexual. Ty did everything he could <br />
to not laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, will you do it?&quot;, Josh pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but I want you to have to work for it. Jim thinks you are <br />
straight, so you're gonna have to make the first move.&quot;, Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
Josh was a little puzzled at the statement &quot;Jim thinks you're <br />
straight.&quot; since he can't imagine why Jim would think that, but <br />
whatever, he'll play along.<br />
<br />
Ty then pretended to transform Jim, but in reality did not do anything <br />
to Jim at all. Ty had no beef with Jim and besides, Josh needed a <br />
little more humiliation to know what it's like to be gay. It was about <br />
time he learned his lesson.<br />
<br />
Jim finished dropping of his gear and drove away.<br />
<br />
The next morning at 3am, Jim showed up promptly on time. He and Josh <br />
jumped into the already packed car and headed out to the wetlands <br />
where they would hold up in the duck blind waiting for first light. <br />
Josh could not help but look at Jim's handsome face well covered by <br />
his rich, black beard, and wanted so badly to pull off into a motel <br />
and ravage that sexy furry body and rub his hands all over his sexy <br />
beard. Josh was getting a major hard-on, which made it uncomfortable <br />
to drive, but he managed.<br />
<br />
Jim made small talk about football and his job woes. Josh could barely <br />
concentrate thinking about that hot man next to him. He wondered why <br />
he felt this way all of a sudden? Was it the seasonal beard? Who <br />
knows. Josh finally couldn't take the small talk anymore, so he <br />
changed the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jim, I always wondered why you don't keep the beard year-round?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the wife would complain about it every day, so I agreed it comes <br />
off before Christmas. I guess I don't have to that this year!&quot;, he <br />
laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, keep it man, it suits you to a tee&quot;, Josh said, staring into <br />
Jim's eyes as long as he dared take is eyes off the road.<br />
<br />
Jim looked over at Josh and asked him, &quot;You know I've grown this beard <br />
off an on since we've known each other and I can't recall you ever <br />
saying a word about it, but thanks, I'm glad you like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don't know why either, man. I dunno, maybe I've changed my <br />
perspective on some things...&quot;, Josh said, letting his words trail <br />
off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perspective? On what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being more open and honest about how I feel about things or <br />
people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Jim. I think you've always known.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Known what man? You're not being very clear. If you've got something <br />
to say, go ahead and say it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh then sees the turn off and figures it would be better to continue <br />
this discussion later. He says, &quot;Let's get to the blind and I'll tell <br />
you everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
They unloaded the gear and all the while Jim was chomping at the bit <br />
to continue the conversation. What was this big secret his old friend <br />
had? His friend could not have known that Jim's wife left him because <br />
she caught him watching Gay Porn, could he? No way, his wife would not <br />
have told anyone. It's too embarrassing...yet there is some secret. <br />
<br />
As they sat in the cold duck blink, Jim said, &quot;Ok we have some time <br />
before light. What's the big secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh sighed. &quot;Ok, I think it's important you know how I feel about <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, what does he know?&quot;, Jim thought silently.<br />
<br />
Josh continued, &quot;I don't know why I never told you this before, but <br />
I'm gay...and by gay I mean 100% gay. I like men and only men.&quot; As he <br />
heard himself talk, it was like some kind of out-of-body experience. <br />
He never remembered saying those words before, but he was sure he must <br />
have, right?<br />
<br />
Jim looking wide-eyed, said, &quot;Ummm, ok. I don't really believe it <br />
though. You date women, have been married, have a son. Why are you <br />
telling me this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh puzzled as he didn't remember dating women or ever enjoying sex <br />
with his ex wife, said &quot;Look, I don't know why you think I dated <br />
women, but I know that I've been gay my whole life. Just trust me on <br />
this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why tell me this now???&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just think you should know. Anything you want to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah fuck, so you know about me. Who told you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody man, I just know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok if you found out from my wife or somebody that is spreading <br />
gossip. I imagine she told someone when she caught we watching gay <br />
porn a few months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? That's why you broke up? You told me it was because she was <br />
blowing all your money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I lied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap&quot;, Josh thought to himself. He was already gay! Did Ty <br />
actually do anything? Anyhow it doesn't matter now. &quot;So have you ever <br />
fucked around with a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo, was too risky. I dunno, maybe it was just a phase. How long <br />
have you been fucking around with guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oddly, Josh could not remember the last time he had, other than <br />
getting sucked off in high school. Strange, because he was SURE he <br />
had. &quot;Doesn't matter. When's the last time you jacked off or had sex <br />
if you don't mind my asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit at this point, that's a tame question. I guess it has been about <br />
a week since I jacked off. Been a little depressed, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh reached down and rubbed Jim's crotch. He felt it getting harder <br />
immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaat are you doing???&quot;, Jim asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just go with it man.&quot;, Josh said. He instinctively knew what to do, <br />
but didn't know why he knew.</p>
