<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Mike sit down on Jeff’s bed, watching curiously at the 12-year-old beginning to type into the computer, “what do you think he’s planning,” Mike asks, looking up at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“I honestly don’t know, Mikey,” Jeff says, he then smiles, “but I do have a slight idea of what he MIGHT be planning”.<br />
<br />
Mike grimaces at the nickname, which he hates so much, “I really wish you’d stop calling me that, Jeff,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at the small boy, who a few moments ago had been his dad, “what’s your issue with that nickname? It’s just a name, and I think it’s cute”.<br />
<br />
Mike blushes, he then sighs, “I… I just don’t have fond memories,” he mutters.<br />
<br />
“Let me guess,” Jeff says, “mean kids used the name to bully and tease you?”<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff lies an arm around his de-aged dad, “look, dad,” he says, the boy looks up at Jeff, “I know how it feels to be bullied, I got and still get bullied by some idiots in school, they call me “little Jeffy”. However, I’ve learned to just ignore them, I even embraced the nickname, whenever someone calls me “little Jeffy” or simply “Jeffy”, I simply reply with “at least I’m cute, only cute guys get called cute names”. The looks on their faces is priceless!”<br />
<br />
Mike looks over at himself in the mirror, he then smiles, “you know, I have to admit, I do look cute,” he says, “I… I guess I can try to embrace the name,” he then looks up at Jeff, smiling, “thanks, Jeff”.<br />
<br />
“No, problem Mikey,” the teen says.<br />
<br />
“At least you are not calling me “Micky Mouse”, like the kids at my school used to do,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
“I guess we all go through stuff like that,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“You think,” Mike asks, turning to look at Tyrone who is still typing, “I don’t know of Tyrone getting bullied”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, believe me, dad,” Tyrone says without turning around, “I do get bullied, but like Jeff, I simply ignore the idiots. Jeff really helped me with his experience, thanks by the way, Jeff,” he then says, turning around for a minute to smile at Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles back, “no problem, Ty,” he says, “are you almost done? We can’t wait to see what you have thought of”.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just a few more edits and I’ll be good,” Tyrone says, turning back to the screen, after a few minutes the 12-year-old leans back in the chair, looking over his inputs, “okay, I think all is set”. Tyrone then confirms the inputs and shivers as the tingling runs through his body, “okay, the tingling does feel weird,” he says, getting to his feet, turning to face Jeff and Mike, and to their shock, Tyrone begins to strip out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
“T-Tyrone,” Mike stammers, “wh-what the hell are you doing?!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone, already out of his t-shirt and already fiddling with his jeans, looks at his de-aged dad, “what? I’m taking my clothes of,” he says, as if it’s no big deal.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Jeff asks, both he and Mike blushing as Tyrone is suddenly standing naked in front of them.<br />
<br />
“You’ll see,” the 12-year-old simply says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“This is so wrong,” Mike says, “I mean… I’m your dad, and Jeff is your 16-year-old brother!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone grins, “I don’t care,” he says, “we are all boys, I’ve got nothing what you guys haven’t seen before,” his grin widens, “to be honest… you should strip off those silly things too! Clothes are sooooo annoying, being naked is the best!”<br />
<br />
“And I thought I was weird,” Jeff says, “sorry in advance, Ty, but I have to say: you are a damn handsome boy! I see all that parkour is paying off!<br />
<br />
“JEFF,” Mike yells, “he’s your 12-year-old brother! You can’t just call him “handsome”!”<br />
<br />
“Why not? I’m just being honest,” Jeff says, “he knows I don’t mean it in THAT kind of way, right, Ty?”<br />
<br />
“Of course not, Jeff,” Tyrone says, he then grins, “I thinks you and Mikey are handsome boys yourselves,” then giggles when both blush harder.<br />
<br />
“Why… why have you taken off your clothes in the first place,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“Because I won’t be needing them anymore soon,” Tyrone replies.<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “what do you…,” his eyes then widen, “ooooh,” he says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“What! What is it, Jeff,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“One of two things,” Jeff says, “either, Tyrone is going to transform into an animal, or two, and this is the most likely option: he’s about to become an anthro!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone grins, “you are absolutely right, Jeff,” he says, “can you guess what type of anthro?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “since your favorite animal is a fox, I’d say: fox!”<br />
<br />
“Right again,” Tyrone says.<br />
<br />
“What is an “anthro”!?”<br />
<br />
Jeff turns to his dad, “you’ll see,” he simply says.<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old crosses his arms and pouts, “I hate being left in the dark,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Tyrone chuckle, “you won’t be in the dark for long, Mikey,” Tyrone says, pointing down, “look at my feet!”<br />
<br />
Both Mike and Jeff look down and both gasp when they notice that Tyrone is standing on his toes, his heels having lengthened and his toes look more like stubby paws with black claws. They both then hear a crack and pop, coming from Tyrone’s legs and watch as they change shape, taking on a more feral-animal appearance.<br />
<br />
Mike’s eyes widen in shock when he watches as Tyrone’s cock begin to erect, “why are you getting an erection!?”<br />
<br />
Tyrone giggles, “it’s not really an erection, Mikey,” he says, “my cock is erecting, because it’ll become my new genitals, that every male feral animal has!”<br />
<br />
Mike’s eyes widen as he watches the cock melting to Tyrone’s tummy, “a… sheath! You have a sheath!”<br />
<br />
“Yup, and not only that,” Tyrone grins wide, reaching down and pulling down on his sheath, causing both Jeff and Mike to gasp when a canine shaped cock including a knot at the base pops out, “I have a new and improved cock,” the 12-year-old says, sounding proud.<br />
<br />
While make just stares in shock, Jeff can’t help but grin, “I must say, Ty,” he says, “that sure is an improvement!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe,” Tyrone says, he then feels a tugging behind him, he turns his head and grins, “my tail! I am growing a tail! I’ve always wanted a tail!”<br />
<br />
“Looks more like a worm to me,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Tyrone giggles, wagging his fleshy appendage, “I haven’t gotten my fur yet!”<br />
<br />
“This… this is effing scary,” Mike mumbles.<br />
<br />
“What is,” Jeff asks, “watching your 12-year-old son transforming into a humanoid animal?”<br />
<br />
“Um… yeah,” Mike says, “why are you so calm about this?”<br />
<br />
“Because, like Tyrone, I LOVE anthros!”<br />
<br />
The two turn when they hear Tyrone groan, and watch as the boy’s face and ears reshape, the boy’s nose flattens, turning black and moist, as his face pushes forward into a muzzle, while his ears grow larger and pointy, slowly moving up his head. Tyrone’s green eyes become yellow and his pupils become slitted.<br />
<br />
“Okay, THAT does look creepy,” Jeff chuckles.<br />
<br />
Tyrone giggles, “not for long,” he says, “I can feel my body beginning to itch all over, I think my fur is growing!”<br />
<br />
Jeff and Mike watch as gray hairs grow from Tyrone, covering his entire body, including his head, “looks like the underfur,” Jeff says, “it should change color as it continues to grow,” he continues.<br />
<br />
Tyrone nods, “yeah, thank god I don’t have to wear clothes anymore,” he says, “it would be so HOT!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mike and Jeff watch as the fur continues to grow, white fur grows on Tyrone’s chest, belly and crotch, on his cheeks and lower jaw and the tip of his tail. Black fur grows on his hands up to his elbows and on his paw feet up to his knees while the rest becomes a shiny red, soon a fox-boy is standing in front of the two human boys.<br />
<br />
“So, how do I look,” Tyrone asks.<br />
<br />
“You look like a young version of Nick Wilde,” Jeff says, grinning, “you look darn cute!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, thanks Jeff,” Tyrone says.<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t believe it,” Mike mumbles.<br />
<br />
Tyrone grins, “better get used to it, dad,” he says, “because THIS is my new appearance!”<br />
<br />
Mike’s and Jeff’s eyes widen, “you mean… it’s permanent!”<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Tyrone says, grinning wide, his tail wagging behind him, “don’t worry, everyone, except you and dad, think I’ve always been like this! And everyone will be okay with me running around naked!”<br />
<br />
Jeff and Mike look at each other in shock, but then Jeff smiles, “if it’s what you really want, then that is your decision,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What about you… dad,” Tyrone asks.<br />
<br />
Mike sighs, he then smiles, “it’ll take a little while to get used to, but… you are still my son,” he then grins, “and honestly, it suits your sneaky and cunning personality!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone wags, “hehe… yeah, it kinda does,” he says, he then walks over to Jeff’s mirror, “wow, I do look cute,” he says as he admires himself in the mirror, “handsome too,” he adds with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“I wonder,” Jeff says, “are you able to walk on all fours if you wanted to?”<br />
<br />
Tyrone nods, getting down on his hands, “yep, thanks to my new legs!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe… you look so adorable,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Tyrone giggle, sitting on his butt like a dog, “so, what now?”<br />
<br />
“Now… it’s my turn again,” Jeff says, “I think I know what I wanna do!”<br />
<br />
“Let me guess,” Mike says, “you are not gonna to tell us?”<br />
<br />
Jeff walks to his computer and sits on the chair, “hehe… nope, not gonna tell!”<br />
<br />
“Fiiiine,” Mike says, both Tyrone and Jeff chuckle.<br />
<br />
The first change Jeff does is to alter his age, changing it from 16 to 8, he then opens the transformation tab and selects “animal”, then “anthro”, then “reptiles”, then “lizards” and finally “Alligator lizard”. Jeff then decides to have his main scales be a nice sky blue with white scales on his chest, belly, crotch and underside of his tail. He also changes his genitals, instead of twin penises, he decides to have just one penis, which is shaped like a canine’s, grinning to himself, he sets the change to be permanent, adding that he wants to return to being 16 by Sunday evening but remaining a lizard-boy permanently, and activates the reality alteration, allowing only Mike and Tyrone to remember him as a 16-year-old human teen, before confirming the changes.<br />
<br />
“All set and confirmed,” Jeff exclaims, getting to his feet and, like Tyrone, begins to strip out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
Mike looks at Jeff, the ten-year-old blushing hard, “let me guess,” he grumbles, “you’re becoming an anthro too?”<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Jeff says, grinning, “smart boy!”<br />
<br />
“Shut it, Jeff,” Mike says, blushing harder, “I feel so left out, being the only one with clothes on!”<br />
<br />
“Then why don’t you strip yourself,” both Jeff and Tyrone ask.<br />
<br />
Mike’s eyes widen, “are you insane,” he asks, “I am your dad! I can’t get naked in front of my own sons!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone and Jeff grin, “you aren’t our dad currently,” they say, “you’re just a 10-year-old kid!”<br />
<br />
“Besides,” Jeff says, grinning, “you won’t be the youngest anymore in a few moments!”<br />
<br />
“Wha-what are you talking about,” both Mike and Tyrone say.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, you’ll see,” Jeff says, “I already can feel myself become smaller and younger!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone and Mike watch, their eyes wide, as Jeff begins to shrink and become younger and younger, until a 8-year-old Jeff is standing before them, grinning up at the two taller boys.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, why are you an eight-year-old,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “because… *cough*… man, I’m not used to this high voice… but I LOVE it,” he says, “anyway, I chose to be eight, because I kinda would like to enjoy some time as a little boy, plus I thought Ty would enjoy being the big bro for a change!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone is shocked, but then he grins, wagging his tail, “hehe… now I get to boss you around,” he says, “this’ll be fun!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “don’t overstep, bro,” he says, “or I’ll have to punish you once I’m back to being the oldest!”<br />
<br />
“You mean… you’re not gonna stay the youngest permanently,” Tyrone asks, sounding disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Nah, I mean, I have my friends and girlfriend,” he says, “and I really don’t wanna start over! I just wanna enjoy the weekend as a kid!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone sighs, “okay… then I’ll enjoy being the big brother for as long as I can,” he says, ‘though I’d like to keep Jeff the youngest, I need to find a way to get my own Chronivac, or find a way to prevent Jeff from reverting back into my stupid big brother,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s happening to your cock,” Mike suddenly asks, pointing.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Tyrone look at Jeff’s genitals which seem to sink back into his body, Jeff grins, “oh, no need to worry,” he says, “my privates are just changing to match my new appearance”.<br />
<br />
“So, you’re becoming an animal that has a slit,” Tyrone asks.<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Jeff says, grinning, “can you guess?”<br />
<br />
Mike and Tyrone look at each other, “what animals have their genitals inside their body,” Tyrone asks.<br />
<br />
Then both boy’s eyes widen, “REPTILES,” the shout at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Yep, but what kind of reptile?”<br />
<br />
“Um… a snake,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Um… a gator,” Tyrone asks.<br />
<br />
“Nope, again,” Jeff says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“A LIZARD,” both Mike and Tyrone shout.<br />
<br />
“Bingo,” Jeff chuckles, “yep, I am becoming a lizard, an alligator lizard to be exact!”<br />
<br />
“Cooool,” Tyrone says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Actually, a lizard does suit you,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
“I think so too,” Jeff says, “lizards are AWESOME!”<br />
<br />
Tyrone giggles, “you’ll look so cute,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “oh, shush,” but he grins, “I hope so!”<br />
<br />
“I know so,” Tyrone says, grinning.<br />
<br />
Mike looks at his two sons, still shocked at what they have done to themselves, the ten-year-old shakes his head, “you boys are weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Just a little,” both say, grinning.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels a tugging on his tailbone, while he feels his skin crawl as blue and white scales begin to replace his skin.<br />
<br />
“I do like the blue color,” Tyrone says.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “yeah, since I’ll be staying an anthro-lizard, I decided to want to have my scales be my favorite color!”<br />
<br />
“Makes sense,” Tyrone says.<br />
<br />
Mike and Tyrone continue to watch Jeff change, watching as the 8-year-old’s hips and butt merge with his growing tail, which soon swishes behind the eight-year-old Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Tyrone says, “you can do some damage with that strong tail of yours!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, I’ll try not to,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Next thing the boys notice is Jeff’s ears shrinking away, only leaving holes behind, “wow, my hearing has increased immensely,” Jeff says, as his hairs all fall out as his face pushes out into a muzzle, soon a 8-year-old lizard-boy is standing in the room, “so, what do you think!?”<br />
<br />
“You look cute and adorable,” Tyrone says, “and handsome too,” he adds with a grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes and giggles, rubbing the back of his neck, “th-thanks… I guess,” he says.<br />
<br />
They then look at Mike, “so, would you want to have another go with the program,” Jeff asks, “or would you like to do something else?”</p>
