<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Svadilfari and Alecto arrive at Lucifer’s court and are surprised to see Enoch quarrelling with a kobold demon with a broken arm. Neither aware that said demon tried to play grab ass with their future sister inlaw, they watch as Enoch orders the guards to toss the irate and bothersome imp out of Lucifer’s throne room.<br />
<br />
“Enoch,” Alecto approaching and hugging his older brother; “it is so good to see you again. Now running fathers court, have you finally decided to claim your birthright,“ His sister playing with him.<br />
“Give birth to a three headed dog and then will talk,” Enoch laughing in return; “what brings you here dear sister?”<br />
“Me,” Svadilfari sounding like he just out galloped a herd of nightmare steeds; “Loki is missing.”<br />
“Dear brother has been a bit of a prankster,” Enoch not sounding worried; “he is most likely planning some convoluted gag to smack Belial in his bullish face with a pie.”<br />
“Normally I would believe you,” Svadilfari stamping his fore legs out of frustration; “but he is eight months pregnant. Even Loki wouldn&#39;t risk the baby just to get under Belial’s skin.”<br />
“Our brother in law makes sense,” Alecto adding; “while Loki does like to play pranks, he would never do one that would risk the baby.”<br />
“All right,” Enoch sighing; “court is winding down. I’ll take you to dad. He is in the study.<br />
<br />
Lucifer sighed as he signed more documents; check to make sure that the senate wasn’t trying to pull some fast one by sneaking through a law that he or Lilith would never stand for. Satisfied that he wouldn’t need to use his veto power; a feature he only had to use sparingly; the last time was when certain demons tried to exploit the conflict of the First World War by having it drag on longer past nineteen eighteen by supplying armaments to both sides of the conflict. Lucifer’s reasoning was that it would enrage heaven and possibly be a violation of the treaties.<br />
<br />
Putting down his pen Lucifer looks up to see Enoch entered followed by his daughter Alecto and Loki’s husband Svadilfari. Svadilfari seeing how cramped it is in Lucifer’s study, uses his magic to transform himself into his human disguise as if he was on earth; an blonde haired blue eyed fully beared Scandinavian with tan trousers and a tweed jacket. Bowing to his father inlaw he soon takes a seat next to Alecto while Enoch opt to sit on his haunches.<br />
<br />
“I take it this is not a social visit,” Lucifer looking at Svadilfari; “how is Loki? He is due in month correct?<br />
“Loki is missing,” Svadilfari spoke; doing his best to compose himself but failing badly.<br />
“Since when,” Lucifer getting up to grab some liquor to calm the distraught demon down.<br />
“This morning,” Svadilfari answering as he accepted the scotch and downed in on gulp; “I tried getting a meeting earlier but Nergal brushed me off. Saying he was busy helping you settle into your new duties,” Looking at Enoch.<br />
“That is bullshit,” Enoch growling; “as if I need help from that shifty worm. I’ve been up hours before dawn discovering and fixing Beelzebub’s cock eyed sentencing loopholes. The only time Nergal has engaged me was in court when presenting evidence of Cruciata’s innocence to her father’s murder.”<br />
<br />
Alecto raised a curious eye to that; she heard that Nergal was very quick to arrest the fly demon. She never did trust Nergal, but had no cause to refuse his orders or to deny him assistance in matters of military justice. But before she could open her mouth to comment; the door to Lucifer’s study busts open and Lamashtu barges in looking like she is ready to commit regicide. Seeing her Brother Enoch, her Sister Alecto and Svadilfari in human form she just grabs a nearby chair and sits down.<br />
“In a polite society,” Alecto looking at her sister; “we tend to knock on doors when wanting entry.”<br />
“Shut it,” Lamashtu glares; “I’m not in the mood.”<br />
“Really,” Enoch scoffing; “I figured getting the job President of Senate would at least stop you from being a sour puss.”<br />
“I’m not in the mood,” Lamashtu glaring at her older brother. Turning to Lucifer, “some witch made off with my property!”<br />
“You barge in here because someone stole a trinket,” Alecto snorting; “come back when a love one goes missing.”<br />
“Love one to you,”Lamashtu dismissing Alecto; “Property to me.”<br />
“Since when do you consider Loki your property,” Svadilfari getting defensive.<br />
“Not him you four legged dolt,” Lamashtu sneering.<br />
“Watch it,” Enoch shouting; “you will hold your insults. Svadilfari is family!”<br />
“Enoch is correct,” Lucifer pouring another scotch and passing it to Lamashtu; “now please tell us what was stolen and who stole it.”<br />
<br />
“Pallaca,” Lamashtu sipping the scotch and putting down in disgust; “her and the rest of my harem. Some witch portaled them out from under my nose.”<br />
“Sounds like something Loki would of done,” Enoch giggling before being serious; “if he wasn’t pregnant and due to give birth.”<br />
“If it is him,” Lamashtu snarling; “pregnancy will not spare him from my wrath!”<br />
“What were you doing when this happened,” Enoch keeping Svadilfari from jumping up to kick his sister inlaw.<br />
“I was busy writing this draft,” Lamashtu presenting her proposition to the senate.<br />
<br />
Enoch took the paper and gave it a quick read before gritting his teeth in disgust.<br />
“Are you out of your mind,” Enoch glaring; his already red face turning purple with rage; “are you trying to start a civil war?<br />
“Well Hecate thought it was harsh,” Lamashtu trying to be calm; “she said it would freeze out the rights of succession. That is why I rewrote it to get around it.”<br />
“By creating a caste system that makes the one in India look like a utopia,” Enoch ready to go to blows with his sister.<br />
“I want to make sure that our legacy is secured,” Lamashtu screaming; “to ensure that no halfbreeds of human borns ever become in charge. I was tormented and teased,” Lamashtu nearly crying; “called names like half-breed and not a true demon.<br />
<br />
Enoch could not believe what he heard; his very own sister using her bigotry and hatred to get revenge over past slights and insults; Enoch had enough and was ready to blow up.<br />
“Half-breed, Not a true demon,” Enoch seething; “did it ever occur to you that you were not the only one growing up to be levied with those insults? Did it not occur to you that I,” Enoch choking with anger; “that I had it WORSE?” I’m the only one in our family to not be born with wings! I’m the only one in our family that walks on four legs,” Enoch now getting up to his full height. “I was called those exact same names,” Enoch screaming; “and I was also call mutt! Dog-boy, Flea bag and all the other sorts of insults that my fellow brethren can levy on a taur such as myself or Svadilfari here,” Enoch tearing his sister down; “So don’t think for one second you had it worse than me.” Enoch grabbing the document after their father finished reading it and tossing it into the fireplace to watch it burn; “because at least you could have flown away the moment you started getting heckled.”<br />
<br />
A silent pall fell over the room as Enoch just glared at his sister who he just tore into; letting out all the anger and frustration he has kept bottled up for several millennia.<br />
“Alecto, Svadilfari,” Lucifer calmly speaking; “can you please give us the room?”<br />
“Let’s go,” Alecto speaking to Svadilfari; “we’ll wait outside.”<br />
Lucifer waited for the door to close before he spoke.<br />
<br />
“I want to tell you something,” Lucifer glaring at his bickering children; “Something that is to never leave this room.”<br />
“What is it father,” Enoch grabing the vodka and pouring himself a double.<br />
“Your birth wasn’t easy,” Lucifer sighing; “I was worried that Lilith would die during child birth. Fortunately I was relieved when she brought you to me and I held you in my arms. When you were born,” Lucifer speaking calmly; “I was filled with joy. I finally have a son I say to myself. I was so excited and happy, I didn’t care that you were different. You were my son,” Lucifer smiling wistfully. “But Beelzebub spoiled my joy by suggesting I have you killed just for being different.”<br />
“No,” Lamashtu sounding shocked.<br />
“Indeed,” Lucifer looking serious; “my friend suggesting I kill you just because you looked more like an beast then a proper demon.”<br />
“That I looked like a mindless animal,” Enoch sounding sad; “got told that loads of times sis. More than you can count being called half-breed.”<br />
“Yes,” Lucifer begging Enoch to stop; “My friend telling me to kill you, as I held you on my arms. I was so filled with rage that I struck him. I struck Beelzebub while you were only a few minutes old. I quickly went back to your mother and returned you to her. The sight of you immediately suckling as she bared her breast to you made me swear to never again let hate divide my family again. It is clear that I failed to keep that vow. So I’m going to leave now,” Lucifer getting up; “you two have five minutes to sort yourselves out before I come back with Alecto and Svadilfari. Use that time to make peace with each other.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“I never realised you had it worse,” Lamashtu sounding contrite; being the first to speak as soon as Lucifer left.<br />
“That is because you only thought of yourself,” Enoch responding; “you weren’t the only one in our family to be insulted. Alecto and Loki and the rest were not spared the same barbs that seem to make you bitter.”<br />
“How come you remained so calm,” Lamashtu speaking; “how come you never sank to their level?”<br />
“By rising above it,” Enoch answering; “by becoming an inspiration instead of a joke.”<br />
“I guess Hecate was in a similar situation,” Lamashtu sighing; “her being a taur like you. She went to earth to see a play. She wanted me to join her.”<br />
“Perhaps you should have,” Enoch pouring himself another drink of vodka; “you want some?”<br />
“I’ll stick with wine,” Lamashtu sounding defeated; “am I really that screwed up?”<br />
“We all are,” Enoch downing his drink before approaching his sister; “you know I have fond memories of you riding on my back as I tried to race the nightmare steeds when you were still just a little imp. You want a few laps around the garden for old time sake,” Enoch doing his best cheer up his sister.<br />
“Those were happier times,” Lamashtu smiling at her brothers offer; “but i&#39;m to big for you, so i&#39;ll settle on you helping me to find my Harem.”<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget Loki,&quot; Enoch responding; &quot;he is also missing.&quot;</p>
