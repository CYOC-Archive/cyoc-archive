<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Opening the window he let him in.<br />
&quot;JAC!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey Patrick, can you come out to play?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? It&#39;s late and I mean what happened, where did you go?&quot;<br />
&quot;Clown City, come on it will be fun. We can run around and be silly.&quot; Jac waddled over to the bookcase.<br />
&quot;Clown City? Nobody remembers you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I enrolled in clown school there; it is so much fun being Jac than boring Jake.&quot; Jac opened a box and held it up to Patrick. Patrick&#39;s heart started to beat hard as he looked down into the box and saw the clown nose.<br />
&quot;But....&quot; the words got lost coming out of his mouth as his thoughts raced. The idea of becoming a clown and running around tonight excited him. Also the idea of becoming a clown scared the shit out of him, what if he couldn&#39;t change back.<br />
&quot;Come on it will be fun.&quot; popped Jac<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be a clown forever.&quot; His hand shook as it reached for the nose unconsciously.<br />
&quot;No problem. You can turn back if you want too.&quot; Patrick looked at his friend, his orange curly hair, white skin and red smiling lips. Those lips came closer and touched his, opening into a deep kiss. Patrick felt a tingle launch itself from his lips down his body to other parts. His hand grasped the clown nose feeling the warm pulse of it. They broke their kiss and Patrick put it on feeling a suction sensation as he did. He sighed as he felt the tingles race over his body as his skin flashed white, the tingles on his lips increased as a red muzzle formed around his mouth and his lips widened into a big smile. His hair stood up and curled into a rainbow colored afro. His eyebrows disappeared as high arches appeared on his forehead along with a thin black line that drew itself downward through his eyes and red circles appeared on his cheeks. Looking down at himself he saw that he had gained weight, not unhealthy but silly and his jumper alternated red and yellow down to his large red shoes. He flexed his four fingered gloved hands feeling the freedom that he could do anything as a clown. He let out a laugh at the felling of silliness that was washing over him. Jac leaned in and kissed him again their nose bumping as their lips found each other.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go have some fun.&quot; Jac walked over to the window and jumped out. Patrick still lost in the kiss eventually followed him. Jac jumped up and farted out a unicycle, Patrick watching suddenly realized he knew how to do that too. Patrick jumped up and farted out his own unicycle and also found that he knew how to ride it. Jac took his hand and Patrick found that his four finger fit perfectly in between Jac&#39;s five like they were meant to be there and they rode down the alley.<br />
They race around the neighborhood laughing having fun before they stopped in front of a house.<br />
&quot;This is that jerk Mr. Stevens&#39; house.&quot; Patrick nodded. Mr Stevens was the P.E. teacher that must have been a drill sergeant previously. He reveled in making kids run until they puked.<br />
&quot;This will loosen him up.&quot; Jac pulled a whoopee cushion out from around his back and blew it up. He motioned for Patrick to follow as they snuck up to his porch and put it under the door. Jac reached up and ran the doorbell and then bounded away. Patrick quickly followed Jac around a tree before Mr. Stevens opened the door in a open bathrobe showing off his faded white briefs to everyone. Patrick and Jac descended into giggles and Mr. Stevens heard them.<br />
&quot;Hey&quot; He yelled as he stepped out after them and right on to the cushion. A loud fart exploded out of the whoopee cushion and Mr. Stevens was engulfed in a pink cloud. The boys were now rolling on the ground in laughter as they watched Mr. Stevens cough and then start to laugh uncontrollably. The light came on next door and they quickly jumped up and farted out unicycles and rode off laughing. They pedal over to a house where a crabby old man lived who was always yelling at kids and throwing things at them. Jac walked over to one of his empty trash cans and pulled it up on the porch and then pulled a seltzer bottle out and began to fill it up. Patrick watch in amazement as the small bottle continued to spout water till the trash can was mostly full.<br />
&quot;Help me lean it against his door.&quot; Jac asked and Patrick got the idea and bounced forward to help. Once they were done Patrick rang the doorbell and they jumped up and bounced across the street on their bottoms and hid.<br />
&quot;Who the fuck is it at this hour?&quot; they heard coming from inside the house and as the door opened, the trash can pushed it open the rest of the way and flooded the old man. Both boys laughed as the old man cursed everyone he could think of. <br />
Patrick suddenly got a idea of someone he wanted to visit and motioned for Jac to follow him. They rode over to Brian&#39;s house and saw a blue light coming from his window. Sneaking over they peeked in and saw a shirtless Brian sitting in front of his computer. Jac and Patrick started to giggle when they saw that he was looking at pictures of swimsuit models. Brian paused like he heard them and they covered their mouths trying to stifle the noise. He pulled up a facebook photo of Mary at the pool and Patrick felt a surge of jealousy jolt through him. Brian started to move and Jac and Patrick froze till they recognized the movement, any boy would, and busted out laughing. Brian jumped in the seat and closed the picture before turning around. Jac and Patrick quickly summoned their unicycles and got out of there, they heard Brian open the window and shout at them. They made it to the park before they finally collapsed in laughter next to each other. Patrick looked at Jac at how silly he looked and moved in to kiss him. Jac responded strongly by kissing him back both of them embracing each other as they started to seriously make out under the moon. After a while Patrick paused and admired Jac&#39;s pale bare chest glowing in the moon light glistening with sweat, his red nipples standing out on the glowing white. Patrick had to admit now what he was and what he wanted. He was gay and he wanted to be with a boy. Admitting this to himself made happiness fill him. He also loving being a clown and could not imagine life not being one but did he want to become one forever? He imagined being with both Jac and Brian. He decided one life realization a night was enough and bent down again to continue to kiss Jac.<br />
Regrettably the fun night had to come to an end and Patrick reluctantly parted company with Jac and went home. He climbed in the window carefully, his bottom was sore from the unicycle, and stood in front of his mirror. He felt a great sadness at the thought of returning to &#39;normal&#39; and slowly move his hand up to the clown nose and tugged. It didn&#39;t come off and Patrick&#39;s heart started to race in panic. He tugged again harder and it still didn&#39;t come off, Patrick stood there wide eyed breathing hard.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not coming off, it has to come off.&quot; Jac said that he could revert back if he wanted to. Did this mean he really didn&#39;t want to? He thought of his life and his mom, he could give that up. He tugged again to no avail. Being a clown was fun but he didn&#39;t want to be one forever. He would miss all of his friends or just one, the image of Brian floated into his head. He was gay he had accepted that, Jac was fun to play with but he wanted to be with Brian, Patrick pictured his soccer player build, his tight jeans and his smile. He tugged again and the nose came lose and even though he felt a sense of loss he was glad it came off. Putting it in the box he climbed into bed and dreamed of Brian and Jac.</p>
