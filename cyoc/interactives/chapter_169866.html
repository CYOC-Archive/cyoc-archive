<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel relieved, she&#39;s talking to you. But the bombshells she&#39;s dropped gnaw at you. Why did you know so little about her? Right now, she really didn&#39;t seem so bad. <br />
Her underwear approaches. &quot;Wait, wait! Can I just ask one more question and then I&#39;ll be a quiet pussy.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; The answer was short and direct, but not necessarily annoyed.<br />
&quot;Everything you just said, I realize I don&#39;t know anything about you. Can we...err...maybe just..talk... tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;Is my pussy asking me out for a date?&quot;<br />
You hesitated, should you reply with a joke about candlelight dinner? No, you settle for: &quot;I guess I sort of am. I just want to get to know you.&quot;<br />
There was a moment of silence that seemed to last forever. You&#39;d never felt so nervous, you didn&#39;t say anything wrong did you? Why was her answer taking so long. Maybe you need to repeat or rephrase the question.<br />
&quot;Maybe..I guess... it&#39;s not a bad idea.&quot; She finally said hesitantly. &quot;Now be a good little pussy like you promised.&quot;<br />
You actually wanted to joke that your lips were sealed except for urination, but swallowed the words. You don&#39;t want to push your luck.<br />
Her underwear clung to your folds again. However, after she&#39;d pulled up her underwear she suddenly moved around a lot. Odd, considering you&#39;d spotted her pants on her bed earlier. Finally, you feel her legs move and your light dims further, but not nearly as much as you expected. You also don&#39;t feel the additional pressure of her jeans. Was she wearing a skirt? You peer at the white cotton and see light fluttering slightly around you. Yes, she&#39;s wearing a skirt. <br />
<br />
The skirt makes the world feel and seem completely different again. You always wondered what wearing a skirt would feel like down there and now you know. There was a sense of freedom around you. It was also a lot less warm than her jeans had been. It was nice. Voices were also a lot clearer now as well. With her period over she&#39;d gone back to work again. You could hear her talk, including making excuses for her absence. You could hear her gossip about Katy. You couldn&#39;t quite hear what she said though. Why didn&#39;t she like her? Or was this gossip normal. <br />
You remained quiet during her toilet breaks. The way she cleaned you was different from how she&#39;d done it these past days. She was more casual somehow. The feel of her fingers spreading your sensitive lips as you were brushed clean was fantastic.<br />
<br />
Finally she returned home. You had no idea if she was going to follow through on your suggestion. You weren&#39;t going to push for it though. Waiting had paid off so far, so waiting it is.<br />
You could hear her prepare dinner, you felt her sit on you to eat it. But you still didn&#39;t hear any other voices. <br />
After dinner she dropped down hard on something, either a couch or her bed. She was fidgeting and you felt a new sensation. There was a tension, you could feel it throughout your pussy body. Did you hear a soft short buzzing noise? After a while you started to notice that after the buzzing noise the tension felt the strongest. What was happening up there. Maybe you should draw some attention to yourself, she is alone after all. But would a pussy draw attention to itself?<br />
Suddenly your world started moving again, a soft music was turned on. <br />
More light flooded in through the cotton, she&#39;d done something with her skirt. She peeled off her underwear. You were staring at an arm piece of a grey couch. Behind it, you could just see a piece of a picture frame mounted on the wall. You think you see the top of two heads on the frame, but it&#39;s hard to tell. Her knees were pointed upwards with her feet down. The couch looked huge from your vantage point, again you felt small. You were just a vagina at her mercy.<br />
There was an awkward silence as you both seemed to be looking for a way to start the conversation.<br />
&quot;So, how was your day?&quot; She suddenly asked.<br />
Okay, how would you respond. How would a once a guy, now a pussy respond to this? &quot;I liked the skirt, thanks for wearing it. There was more light and it was less warm. How was your day?&quot; That seemed like a good response.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; The awkward silence returned. &quot;So why a vagina?&quot;<br />
That was a rather personal question, but a good one. &quot;I...just like girls. And being a vagina seemed hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, at least we have that first one in common. I just can&#39;t imagine anyone wanting to be a vagina. You just sit there, you can&#39;t do anything. You leak once a month. People stick things into you. Hey, are you getting aroused? God, you&#39;re terrible.&quot;<br />
You couldn&#39;t help it. The period wasn&#39;t particularly pleasant but everything else she described was stuff you found hot. You were so curious what being penetrated by something other than a tampon would feel like. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop it, just think of something else, like a shower.&quot;<br />
You remember the lovely feel of the was flowing over your sensitive mounds and the way she washed you. Gently touching your lips.<br />
&quot;Hey! Stop it, or I&#39;ll put you right back in the corner.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; You focus on broccoli and never having to eat that ever again and feel the heat and moist in your mouth fading away. &quot;You know, I just haven&#39;t had much luck with girls, so I figured being a vagina would help me get close to one.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...some insane troll logic right there. No, your problem is the same problem a lot of men have. You&#39;re chasing the wrong girls. Just judging them based on how hot they are and trying to get close to them. Ignoring any girl that doesn&#39;t respond to your flirts.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not true!&quot;<br />
&quot;I saw your list remember? The only &quot;non-hot&quot; girl was Kat and you crossed her off multiple times. Besides she&#39;s a whole other issue.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with Kat?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, guys. It&#39;s a good thing your a girl now. Listen, Kat sucks. She&#39;s a lying bitch.&quot;<br />
&quot;No she&#39;s not. She&#39;s funny and nice. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s always nasty to everyone, maybe if you didn&#39;t she&#39;d be nice to you as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;You stupid cunt, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; For a moment, you fear you&#39;ve overstepped some invisible boundary. You actually feel an unpleasant tension in her. &quot;You know the rumors right?&quot; She suddenly said, her voice sounded, fragile. <br />
&quot;I only know one rumor, about how you go wild with a new guy every weekend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the one. -Where do you think that started?&quot;<br />
&quot;Seriously? She started that? I can&#39;t believe that, why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because she&#39;s gay and I turned her down. Most of the rumors and nasty stuff you heard about were actually her doing.&quot; <br />
&quot;I heard you gossiping about her and you tried to get me fired  once. You&#39;re not much better.&quot; Crap, you should stop talking before you finish thinking. But hearing her attack your friend just pissed you off.<br />
&quot;Everyone gossips and yes I did try to get you fired once. The way you keep leering at girls asses is borderline harassment and I caught you doing stuff you shouldn&#39;t do at work.&quot;<br />
&quot;Everyone does that!&quot;  How dare she judge you like this!<br />
&quot;Shut up pussy.&quot; And with that, you were back to being a silent pussy between her legs again. &quot;Ugh, maybe trying to talk to you was a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
You want to reply, but you can&#39;t. You&#39;re just a vagina between her legs now.<br />
Another silence follows, but she doesn&#39;t cover you up. Which gives you hope at least. &quot;Okay, listen. I get why you&#39;re angry. You think she&#39;s your friend and you stick up for her. Admirable. But she&#39;s been a bitch to me and I know she gossiped about you as well. Right, I was miserable when I tried to get you fired. I was on my period, that bitch was spreading rumors and you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I&#39;m sorry for that at least.&quot; <br />
Silence follows. &quot;Oh right, you can talk again.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry as well. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.&quot; You say with as much remorse as a pussy can muster. &quot;Different subject, okay. If you don&#39;t mind me asking. I now know that the rumor about you and guys is utterly false. So where is your girlfriend? You said you had one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but my pussy suddenly became sentient which freaked me out. So I kept her at a distance for now.&quot; You could tell from her voice she wasn&#39;t very happy with this. &quot;But she&#39;s getting impatient. I can&#39;t blame her, but how would you react if you were still a guy and the girl you&#39;re with suddenly tells you there&#39;s a guy in her vagina just as you want to get intimate?&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, I understand that. Sorry I got in the way.&quot; You slowly become aware of a pressure building in your body.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a terrible liar. You&#39;re a pussy because you think that&#39;s hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;True, but I&#39;m still sorry. Also, you should go to the toilet.&quot;<br />
&quot;You can feel that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can feel everything down here.&quot;<br />
Suddenly a loud doorbell interrupts her answer.</p>
