<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam entered his bedroom where he saw Noah attempting to wear some old fashioned white briefs.<br />
&quot;Noah! Where did you find that?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
&quot;There was a lot of briefs in your closet... and I was a little ashamed of the idea of putting my pee-pee into a brief which you had put your pee-pee too...&quot; Noah said a little embarrassed. &quot;That I took these old ones from that box.&quot;<br />
&quot;Noah...&quot; Sam had no idea of how deal with his son&#39;s embarrassment. &quot;I know this is weird and bullshit... but, you don&#39;t have to be ashamed.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird, dad. I mean, Sam.&quot; Noah replied. &quot;It hadn&#39;t happened to me before but now I can&#39;t avoid feeling big and silly.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not like that.&quot; Sam said. &quot;Oh well, ok. Maybe you&#39;re bigger but you&#39;re not silly or anything like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I feel like that. I mean, my arms and legs feel loose. My hands and feet are oddly numb and I can&#39;t stop thinking on how my pee-pee has swollen and now it dangling between my legs.&quot; Noah said. &quot;Do you feel like that as an adult, dad?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Sam hadn&#39;t any idea of what to say. &quot;Yes... I guess... Noah, *sighed* there&#39;s something about that I need to tell you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why did I grow up?&quot; Noah said.<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t any idea... and honestly I don&#39;t know what will happen...&quot; Sam said. &quot;But if you&#39;re going to look like that for a while... at least you need to know about your body changes.<br />
&#12299;You&#39;ll see. In life, people go through certain changes in their bodies. When I was your age I looked almost like you... well, before this growth spurt.&quot;<br />
Noah curled his toes. They felt way bigger and longer than before.<br />
&quot;Anyway... I went through something called puberty. A natural process where our bodies change from boyhood to adulthood.&quot; Sam continued.<br />
&quot;So? This is puberty?&quot; Noah asked.<br />
&quot;Not exactly. It takes some years to grow like that.&quot; Sam said a little uncomfortable after looking at his son&#39;s body. &quot;But the changes are the same and therefore your body looking is the one of any other adult.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, do you have a big and silly body too?&quot; Noah said.<br />
&quot;Yes! I mean, no!&quot; Sam replied. &quot;Being an grown man is not silly. You&#39;ve changed, yes. But I&#39;ve gone through those changes too. Look, you&#39;re as tall as me now!&quot;<br />
&quot;So, does your pee-pee dangles like mine?&quot; Noah asked innocently. &quot;Can I see it?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No, fuck!&quot; Sam yelled disgusted. &quot;I won&#39;t undress in front of another man! Jeez!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not? You said you&#39;re like me.&quot; Noah said. &quot;Isn&#39;t that true?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, yes; but...&quot; Sam said.<br />
&quot;Then, what are you hiding?&quot; Noah interrupted. &quot;You&#39;ve seen my pee-pee a lot of times before. Even now that it had swollen!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, ok... I&#39;ll show you...&quot; Sam sighed. He slowly unzipped his pants, took them off and threw them away. &quot;This is weird.&quot; He muttered. &quot;It&#39;s the first time I get naked for a man. Fuck! How gay it sounded!&quot;<br />
&quot;Gay?&quot; Noah asked but he was ignored by Sam who realized he didn&#39;t take off his shoes. &quot;Your feet are big, dad. What shoe size are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;13 and I can bet you are too.&quot; Sam said. &quot;None of your size 8 shoes will fit you anymore.&quot;<br />
Noah looked at his own feet and he blushed after noting how similar his and his dad&#39;s feet were now.<br />
&quot;Is it normal being so hairy?&quot; Noah asked shyly. &quot;Our feet are hairy... our legs too. My pee-pee has a lot of hair above it...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well. My family is a hairy one.&quot; Sam replied. &quot;Look at your uncles. They all have beards and hairy bellies. We both have that too. Look.&quot; He took off his shirt and revealed a hairy rug covering almost all his torso. He then put a hand to Noah&#39;s chest who was also very hairy. &quot;Raise your arms.&quot; Noah did it as well as he. &quot;See? We&#39;re even hairy in our armpits.&quot;<br />
Noah looked at the dense forests under his arms and put them down after smelling a subtle bad smell coming from them.<br />
&quot;I stink, dad!&quot; Noah complained.<br />
&quot;Hehe... I forget it.&quot; Sam said. &quot;When you grow up you begin to sweat more and with that it comes bad smelling like the one in your armpits, your feet...&quot;<br />
&quot;My feet too?!!&quot; Noah yelled.<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Sam continued. &quot;And your crotch. But if you use deodorant you won&#39;t have to worry too much about it. Even you could fart and belch without worries.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, that&#39;s gross.&quot; Noah told him. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that being a man implies being nastier.&quot;<br />
&quot;You will get used.&quot; Sam said. &quot;And if this take too long, you must get used to it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok dad! I&#39;m a smelly furball with big feet and a dangling pee-pee!&quot; Noah said a little confused as he made an odd pose. &quot;You&#39;re too! So all men are like that! I didn&#39;t know that growing up meant to become more like a monkey!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t said that!&quot; Sam said but in his mind he thought that Noah&#39;s description was funny accurate. &quot;Oh what the hell! Come here and give a big monkey hug to your old man! Haha!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think it could be weird?&quot; Noah asked shyly but he wanted to hug his dad so much that he didn&#39;t wait for an answer and he hugged Sam. &quot;Dad... it feels weird... our hairs touching each other, our arms, our feet... and that warming feeling coming from your pee-pee.&quot;<br />
After hearing that, Sam went back to his senses. He pushed his son away and looked at what he was fearing. Noah was getting an erection. How gross was for him to look at another man sporting a boner, even if he knew it was from his son and probably it was his first erection.<br />
&quot;Hey, dad! I mean, Sam!&quot; Noah shouted surprised. &quot;My pee-pee is growing again!&quot; He shyly rubbed his shaft as if he was discovering his dick for the first time. &quot;Look, Sam! Your pee-pee is growing too!&quot;<br />
Sam looked at his own penis and indeed, he was getting a boner too. It was like a tent growing from his boxers.<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t take off your undies it&#39;ll blow up!&quot; Noah joked.<br />
Sam tried to ignore that comment and he attempted to cool down his erection but it was useless and he knew that he needed to take off his boxers before it was late.<br />
Finally and with a quick hand move, he stripped down in front of his son. Now, there were two naked men in that room sporting raging erections.</p>
