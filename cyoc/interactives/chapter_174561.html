<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Given how insane everything was, you didn&#39;t want a horde of police bearing down your door, followed by fire bombs being dropped on the house by the army. Maybe sending Tina out would cause trouble, but having someone not come back from a delivery from a part that you hadn&#39;t even known existed before would be even worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina, finish your deliveries. Call me after you&#39;re finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
The zebra plushie bowed. &quot;Of course Master, I obey.&quot;<br />
<br />
She skipped back out of the house. You saw through the window, as soon as she touched her old beat-up car... it changed, the wheel, the pedals, the chair, all shifting to fit her size, the car itself shifting to look more shiny and new as well. The car drove off on the dirt road leading away from the mansion.<br />
<br />
Jennifer meanwhile, had found a feather duster with no trouble (the closet fashioned for one her size) and had diligently and industriously gotten to work clearing away every speck of dust, a broad smile on her face the entire time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer... is your family going to worry about you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you or Tina going to worry about me Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean your family from, before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Them.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;My sister and her family wasn&#39;t expecting me home this evening. I should be fine. Do you wish me to call them over and become yours Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! I mean, not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Master.&quot; It was disturbing how she shrugged off her family, and considered you and Tina her real family... and offer them as a suggestion for new servants... but at the same time maybe a bit... exciting? You shook your head. This was all too much. Your house. Your stuff. Your family. You were now doomed to be a prisoner of this place, served unquestioningly by living plushies who used to be people... On the bright side, you always hated traveling, and your job was a slog. <br />
<br />
Might as well explore. You went up the set of stairs in the grand entry hall/living room, and went along the hallway/balcony, coming to another set of stairs, and went up those, and went up those next. You didn&#39;t remeber the mansion having this many floors from the outside, did you? You wished you could get to the top already. And just like that, the stairs let to the top of a small tower at the very peak of the mansion. You looked out the windows, seeing the impressive property line but was still the outline of your prison. You could at least see a pretty landscape beyond, that you were now doomed to never interact with...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t appreciate what you have until it&#39;s gone,&quot; you remarked.<br />
<br />
You stared wistfully at the outside. After a whole you realize you had to do your business. You shuddered to think what the bathrooms in this place had to be like. But it was still better than taking a dump outside. <br />
<br />
You went down the stairs. Dangit. You had no idea which room was which. Any of these rooms could be the bathroom. You were just going to open them one by one and-, huh? The first door you opened, and it was the bathroom. What a relief. Sigh. Might as well get it over with.<br />
<br />
You were surprised to find while doing your business that there was still running water in this place. Maybe Jennifer called? Would water even begin running so soon? Were the pipes even still working in this place? To your relief, it seemed they were.<br />
<br />
Well, that was a relief. Time to get back to Jennifer then and see how she was doing. You were looking forward to walking down all those... stairs? Okay, you KNOW that there more flights of stairs going up than going back down!<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master?&quot; The plush cat turned around with a smile and looked up at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might be going crazy. Assuming this isn&#39;t all just some delusion, which would actually explain a lot. I went down fewer flights of stairs then flights of stairs I went up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! That! I was worried for a moment Master. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s simply the Mansion changing shape to your will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This house and you are joined together. It expresses your will the same way your body does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...&quot; You thought about it. &quot;Would explain how I got at the top so fast, and found the bathroom so fast... so... could I stretch the house to outside the park or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I do not believe so Master. I think it&#39;s safer to assume the house is bigger on the inside than the outside and rearranges its negative space according to your wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You threw your hands up in the air. &quot;FINE! Why not! That makes as much sense as everything else around here! And... GAH! I&#39;m an idiot! I forgot to give Tina my number! She&#39;ll have to come all the way back here to talk to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that a problem Master? This is where she belongs. It is where I belong. We are yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we should be. We have been remade in your image Master. Don&#39;t beat yourself up over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed.<br />
<br />
There was a beeping from your phone. You didn&#39;t recognize the number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina! How did you get  my number?&quot; You set on speaker for Jennifer&#39;s sake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I have my Master&#39;s number? I am happy to report all the humans calmly accepted what I am. The few who even noticed only said what a cute baby plushie maid I am. Everything went perfectly smoothly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... What is that even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People live in blissful contradictions every day Master. &#39;Help each other out, but out compete each other&#39; as an example. Most humans just want to live their lives and will happily turn a blind eye to anything outside their comfort zone,&quot; Jennifer offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine, true, but your FAMILIES are NOT going to pretend they don&#39;t see anything unless they&#39;re the most apathetic humans on Earth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I lived alone Master, so it is no big deal,&quot; Tina offered over the phone. &quot;Also, I checked my ID card Master, everything is going to be fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer herself looked surprised at this, and took out a plastic card like the kind you&#39;d see on a plush toy at a toyshop. It had a picture of her as she was now. Weight. Height. &#39;Species.&#39; Colors. And listed her as the personal property of &#39;Adam Storms&#39; aka, you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great,&quot; you sighed.</p>
