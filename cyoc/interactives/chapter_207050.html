<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd was angry.<br />
<br />
He’d just gotten home from work and dropped off his things. His parents weren’t home yet. Dad worked night shift and mom was second shift. Todd considered making dinner so she wouldn’t have to. He started a pot boiling. Maybe they could make some spaghetti or something. <br />
<br />
Before that, he needed a shower. His phone rang when he’d shucked off his dirty clothes. Todd answered it, staring at his portly figure in the mirror. Little dick, acne and a gut. No wonder he never got any tips.<br />
<br />
It was Jeff. He considered letting it ring. But…he never gave that stupid jock his number. So how did he know it? Todd answered it.<br />
<br />
“What?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, you coming over, bro?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Taking a shower and coming right over. This better be worth it.”<br />
<br />
“It is, it is!” Jeff paused. “Hey, uh…is this thing harmful?”<br />
<br />
Todd rolled his eyes. “You mean besides changing the fabric of reality?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. It won’t, like, give me cancer or something, right?”<br />
<br />
“Who knows.” Todd said shortly. Then he frowned. “No. You probably wouldn’t even feel it either. Maybe a tingle or a warmness in your body. It freezes particles back at whatever lab it came from and the resulting ‘ripple’ hits you a second later.”<br />
<br />
“So it isn’t hitting me with this emitter?”<br />
<br />
“Emitter….” Todd thought hard. “It probably bounces particles off the target so the machine knows the location of the particles it needs to alter. Then it sets off a chain reaction targeting those particles.”<br />
<br />
“Can it…”<br />
<br />
“Look, man, I’ll be there in twenty minutes. Just let me shower.” Todd snapped.<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Jeff sounded oddly sad. “Did I do anything to you?”<br />
<br />
“No. You ignored me like everyone else.” Todd said. “Bye.”<br />
<br />
“...Bye, Todd. See you in a bit.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hung up.<br />
<br />
Todd tossed the phone on top of his fresh clothes and stepped into the shower. When he was done, he toweled off, got dressed in some loose jeans and a t-shirt, brushed his teeth and left. His car was a junker, so it took him a little while.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br />
<br />
Finn sat at the computer while he waited for Jeff to finish showering.<br />
<br />
The READ-ME file hadn’t contained anything except installation instructions. He decided to find out Todd’s profile. He punched in the nerd’s first and last name. [SEARCHING…] appeared on the screen. Four matches came up. Finn pulled the most likely one.<br />
<br />
Perfect match. Nerdy, worked at American Restaurant. High IQ. It was definitely him.<br />
<br />
Finn remembered how annoying the nerd was. Jeff was acting like he’d known him his whole life. Despite Jeff’s warnings, he couldn’t let Todd fuck up the good thing he had going with his boyfriend. That simply wasn’t an option. Todd had to go. If Jeff wanted to understand the Chronivac, he could just make himself a smart employee or something.<br />
<br />
He drummed his hooflets on the desk as he considered what he wanted to turn the guy into. The shower turned on in the bathroom. He had about five minutes to do whatever he wanted and then go back to the main window so Jeff wouldn’t know what Finn had changed. Honestly, he wasn’t 100% sure that he even believed something like this could exist.<br />
<br />
Whatever he chose, he’d need the transformation to be over before the game downstairs was. Dad was his ride home, after all. His car had broken down and…<br />
<br />
Finn snapped his fingers. <br />
<br />
Of course! He needed a new car. For some reason the old clunker his dad bought for him just wasn’t fitted for a ram the size of Finn, so…something custom. A hummer. Make sure it had a battery so he could claim a hybrid vehicle, despite Hummers definitely <I>not</I> being hybrids. He punched int the alterations and then hit [ENTER].<br />
<br />
[Finalizing changes] blinked on the screen.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Todd parked outside of Jeff’s house and was walking up the driveway when a shiver struck him.<br />
<br />
Behind him, completely unnoticed, his car unraveled, from the paint down to the trash in his very messy car. Todd shivered as his clothes quickly followed suit, leaving him naked and shivering in the dark driveway. He looked around, wondering why he was suddenly so cold, and saw the pale skin of his bare gut in the moonlight and felt a breeze on his crotch. Todd gasped, covering himself, confused. Why was he naked?<br />
<br />
He was starting to feel warm and oddly comfortable, the cold breeze no longer bothering him. His pasty white skin grew more opaque, the clear-coat shimmering softly in under the light of the moon. Todd noticed his strangely translucent skin and went to rub it when he saw his hands darken and bulge, fingers sticking together and forming into a black rubber ball.<br />
<br />
 Todd stared in horror at his hands when his feet cramped and he found himself on all fours, arms forced apart. His legs popped and cracked, perfectly parallel to his arms. He tried to scream, but all he could do is make a breathy wheeze. He didn’t know what was happening or why he was so goddamn horny, but his dick was achingly hard despite his terror.<br />
<br />
<i>W-what’s happening to me?</I> Todd thought, <I>Why does this feel so good?</I><br />
<br />
A light appeared in the house on the second floor. Todd looked up and saw the ram from earlier…Finn or something. Finn stared down at him and smirked. Todd growled, the sound oddly loud. He growled again, the sound revving in ears that were growing and widening into side view mirrors.<br />
<br />
The sound of metal groaning, bending and stretching filled his ears, just before he lost his ability to hear anything at all. Todd could feel his body stretch and expand, heaving up hugely behind him. He felt his mouth grin involuntarily and then it widened and stretched out into a shiny chrome grill and bumper.<br />
<br />
Todd’s eyes went wide and then grew translucent, lights flicking on and shining wherever he looked as they became headlights. Strangely, he could still see through them. He felt something hard push out of his ass. It was uncomfortable, but it brushed past something as it grew out of him that made Todd honk. <br />
<br />
Things were forming inside of him. Comfortable seating, leather the same pasty-white of his skin, thicker and plumper than normal. His bodily fluids becoming oil, stomach contents becoming gas as his stomach shifted into a tank. Todd was not in pain. In fact, all he felt was pleasure. <br />
<br />
His brain shifted and transformed into a piece of silicon chipboard. As much as he wanted to worry, all he could think about was his oil temperature and fluid levels. Todd tried to resist, but being a Hummer was amazing. His engine was so powerful, he could feel it rumble and shake his ever-growing frame. He’d been modified to fit his owner, after all.<br />
<br />
Todd’s headlights flickered as he realized what he was thinking. Owner? Since when did he have an owner?<br />
<br />
A license plate appeared on his front and backside. As the number appeared on it, the driver’s biometrics appeared in Todd’s mind. Finn was identified as his owner and a pair of keys appeared in the ram’s pocket upstairs. <br />
<br />
It was all too much for Todd. His mind was being crammed full of stuff that wasn’t normal-routes and favorite stations. He stopped resisting, letting them flow into him. As he did, the transformation completed. A very expensive Humvee with a custom paint-job and leather upholstery sat in the driveway.<br />
<br />
[Process Complete] was flashing on the computer.<br />
<br />
-=-=-==-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Three hours later, the two rams exited Jeff’s house.<br />
<br />
“That sure is an interesting Hummer, Finn.” The fat older ram said, patting Todd’s hood.<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Finn said, smirking.<br />
<br />
“See ya at home, kiddo. By Mike, by Jeff!” The ram waved at the two tigers in the doorway and got into his own vehicle.<br />
<br />
Finn waited for him to pull out and down the street before getting in Todd. The Hummer sagged slightly under his weight. Todd felt him on his well-cushioned car seat, feeling the muscular cheeks and fluffy tail as his weight settled inside him. The ram sighed in relief, and Todd found himself feeling oddly…proud of being so comfortable.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s take you for a drive.” Finn laughed and started up the Hummer.<br />
<br />
“What did you do?” Todd’s voice came over the radio.<br />
<br />
Finn stared at it, surprised. “You’re still here?”<br />
<br />
“Turn me back!” Todd insisted. “You have a Chronivac, right?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Todd, but we can talk later.” Finn grinned and changed the radio.<br />
<br />
Country music blared. Finn buckled himself in, giving Todd the odd feeling of hugging the big, muscular ram. Then he jiggled the stick shift, and Todd mentally gasped. It felt like Finn was playing with his cock. Finn turned the key in his ignition, sending a shiver through Todd. His body filled with raw power as his engine turned on.<br />
<br />
Finn revved up and pulled out. Todd couldn’t believe how good it felt to move. The ram shifted, getting comfortable, and Todd felt another strange thrill shoot through him. It was concerning, but he had other things to think about.<br />
<br />
Fuel efficiency, GPS navigation, and radio channels were all jostling for attention. Todd didn’t cease to exist, but simply faded back into the wash of programming, his thoughts growing simpler to compete for space. What was left was a relatively smart AI chipset that automatically controlled the vehicle with some Todd left over.<br />
<br />
The ram raced the truck up and down the highway. It was amazing, so amazing that Todd couldn’t help but enjoy himself. He could actually feel the air, the rush, the asphalt beneath his wheels. Finn pulled up into his own home’s driveway and idled there.<br />
<br />
Finn turned on the radio and switched it over to Todd’s channel. The Hemmer was moaning happily. Finn smirked, though he felt kinda bad. He revved the car over and over again, listening to Todd moan and grunt over the radio.<br />
<br />
He did a burnout and Todd mentally orgasmed, tailpipe backfiring.<br />
<br />
“Good job, Todd.” Finn grinned and got out.<br />
<br />
Todd stayed parked and waited for his owner to come back, no longer upset with being a vehicle.</p>
