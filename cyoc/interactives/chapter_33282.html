<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well how do you feel sweetie?&quot; Hannah's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good&quot; her mother said. &quot;Now what memories do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember my life as a girl&quot; Hannah said. &quot;I do remember being Rick but it's easier for me to remember being Hannah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense&quot; her mother said. &quot;In this reality you were born Hannah Lynn Thompson. Now then it's time for us to go pick up your sister from school.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the way to pick Jenny up Hannah started to think about what had happened. Basically there were two people inside her now. One is her former self and the other one is her. They share memories but each have an easier time remembering things specific to them. She can easily remember what she did last month as Hannah but she had trouble remembering what she did as Rick last month. She wondered if she would<br />
forget that she was a boy before. She hoped that she wouldn't forget.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before they pulled up to the school and Jenny got in the car. The first thing that their mother asked was &quot;Did you mutter the spell around anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was careful&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you change your clothes?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't notice a stain on my dress this morning&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Dora pointed it out to me so I decided to change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I don't like it when you change reality like that&quot; their mother said. &quot;Since you have to utter the words you have to be careful. If someone had heard you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Mom&quot; Jenny said. &quot;There are people who would use me for their own purposes if they found out I can do magic. You've told me this before and I did listen. I made sure that no one was anywhere near me when I said the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm more worried about someone harming you if they found out&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that too Mom&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I still don't know why someone would hurt me if they found out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because people often hurt things they don't understand&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right Hannah&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you...&quot; Jenny began to ask. &quot;Oh I forgot that you were 34 years old before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'll have too much to worry about with you Hannah&quot; their mother said. &quot;You seem to know a little about human nature. I hope you'll remember that as you grow up again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn't she remember that?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Hannah gained some new memories today&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all gain new memories everyday&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like I did&quot; Hannah said. &quot;By the way, I'm sorry I ripped your favorite dress last month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You apologized when you did it&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; Jenny said, &quot;I didn't tell you that. How did you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember it&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't remember it&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Last month you weren't a member of this family. You said that you didn't have memories of being Hannah before your change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has them now&quot; their mother said. &quot;It took a couple days for her memories to catch up. If you enter her mind I think you'll understand. In fact I'm going to be teaching Hannah how to enter minds and how to protect her mind. I want you to help me Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
At this time they arrived home and went inside. As soon as they were inside their mother said &quot;Ok girls, take off your coats and shoes. We'll then start training Hannah how to enter minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah took off her coat and Jenny hung it up for her. They went into the living room and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Hannah&quot; their mother said, &quot;in order to learn to enter minds you first have to know how to go into your own. What I want you to do is close your eyes and see your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; Hannah said. She closed her eyes and tried to see her room. She was able to see it vaguely.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're doing good&quot; her mother said sounding a little bit quieter than she usually did. &quot;Take a deep breath and relax. Your vision of your room should become clearer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah did as her mother said and she did see her room clearer. It started to seem like she was actually in her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're almost in your mind&quot; her mother said even quieter than before. &quot;Now see yourself in your room looking at it through your eyes. See it as if you were up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah did that and she could swear that she was in her room. All of a sudden Rick walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here we are again&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure did&quot; her mother said as she walked in. &quot;A normal four year old wouldn't have been able to do this. Jenny should be coming in any moment now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just after her mother said this Jenny did enter Hannah's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is this?&quot; Jenny asked looking at Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is who Hannah use to be&quot; their mother said. &quot;This is Rick. Rick, this is my daughter Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do know who she is&quot; Rick said. &quot;Hannah and I have the same memories after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do&quot; Hannah's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been thinking about what Hannah and I are&quot; Rick said. &quot;We are separate yet intertwined people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please explain&quot; Hannah's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Hannah gained her memories of herself as a girl, I have been unable to experience what she has experienced&quot; Rick said. &quot;I am able to remember her experiences as a girl the past two days with some difficulty but nothing before or after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you still remember being Rick Hannah?&quot; her mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With some difficulty I can&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Mom?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah and Rick are part of the same person&quot; her mother explained. &quot;They became separate when the medallion transformed Rick into Hannah. The separation took a couple days to complete though they are still connected. They were the same person until a couple days ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this mean that I'll forget about being Rick Mommy?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; her mother said. &quot;You may find it harder to remember your life as Rick as time goes on but I don't think you'll forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be like forgetting then&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it would be if it gets difficult enough&quot; Hannah's mother said. &quot;Now then we need to teach Hannah how to enter minds. You know how to enter your own mind now Hannah. All you have to do to enter other people's minds is to go out your door. You'll find that you are in a place with many doors floating in a vast space. You'll be able to sort of fly to any door you choose. You have to be careful when<br />
you do though since there could be protection around the mind. Most protected minds are just shielded which won't harm you. Others have traps that will be set off if you try to enter the mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I know if I can get into a mind?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can't get into a mind you'll feel like someone is pushing you away&quot; her mother said. &quot;Don't go into those minds unless you really need to. Now I've opened my mind to you while Jenny hasn't. This is to show you what it feels like when you can enter a mind and when you can't. Now let's go out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know which doors are your minds?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just concentrate on the person whose mind you want to enter&quot; her mother said. &quot;When you do that you'll be drawn to their door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; Hannah said. She went and opened her bedroom door then stepped out. She was amazed at all the doors she could see when she did. There were too many doors to count. Each door she could see had a piece of floor in front of it to stand on. She looked down and saw that she was standing on a piece of floor in front of her door. Once she had taken in what she could she concentrated on her mother. She had expected to go floating off when she did but she stayed on<br />
her floor. She wondered why she couldn't go to her mother's door.<br />
<br />
Her mother came up beside her and said &quot;You need to push off while concentrating on the person. Watch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah watched while her mother jumped and kept going. She decided to copy her. She concentrated on her mother and jumped. She was now floating/flying in this place. She didn't float long and almost immediately she landed outside a door. She wondered if it was her mother's door but didn't know for sure. She didn't feel like she was being pushed away so she decided to go in. She opened the door and went inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you made it&quot; her mother said when she entered her mother's mind.<br />
<br />
Hannah looked around and noticed that it didn't look like her mother's bedroom. &quot;Why doesn't this look like your bedroom Mommy?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does look like it&quot; her mother said. &quot;This was my bedroom when I was 16. You can choose to have it look like any personal room you have or had. I chose this as it was in my bedroom when I was 16 that I lost my virginity. Now go to your sisters mind but don't try to enter it. I'll meet you back in your mind. Just concentrate on yourself to get back to your mind.&quot; She left her room then.<br />
<br />
Hannah followed her mother out and then concentrated on Jenny. She jumped and then about as quickly as before she landed outside another door. With this one she did feel like she was being pushed away. She remembered what her mother said and didn't try to go in. She turned around and went back to her mind.<br />
<br />
Once she was back in her mind her mother asked &quot;Do you know the difference between minds you can go into and those you can't?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do Mommy&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; her mother said. &quot;Now I'll so you how to protect your mind. Look at your door and see it glow. That will mean that you have a shield protecting your mind. Now at first it will not allow anyone in. To allow people in just place your hand on the door and concentrate on those you want to be able to enter. I would like it if you allowed myself and your father in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah turned to her door and saw it glow. Then she placed her hand on it and allowed her mother and father to enter. She had turned around and saw a crystal on her bed. She picked it up and asked &quot;What's this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a memory crystal&quot; her mother said. &quot;It shouldn't be on your bed though. Jenny, Rick, did either of you two have this out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did Mom&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; her mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was curious&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn't be going through your sisters memories&quot; her mother said. &quot;Hannah, put the crystal in the box under your bed and do the same thing you did with your door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah did as she was told. When she was done she asked &quot;What now Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we go back to the world&quot; her mother said. &quot;All you need to do is concentrate on opening your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah concentrated on opening her eyes and her room slowly faded. When it had faded completely she was able to open her eyes. When she did she saw her mother and sister with their eyes still closed but they opened them soon after.</p>
