TransFun is a company that provides transformation serums to its customers that allow them to alter their bodies.  TransFun is best explained by its own mission statement, proudly displayed on their company website:<br />
<br />
&quot;The premise is simple: What if there was a company who sold serums to change people from one form into another? Part magic, part science, all fun --TransFun aims to make people&#39;s dreams into realities! From animals to inanimate objects to anthropomorphic creatures, the sky is the limit!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
***************************************** About the TransFun Company ****************************************<br />
<br />
Established in 2014, the TransFun company soon attracted the attention of the national media with its unique products and services as well as its ambitious quality assurance guarantee, offering ‘100% safe changes’.   <br />
<br />
The owners of the company are unknown.  Only one founder has ever been identified - an auburn-haired spokeswoman by the name of Mira. Before her association with TransFun,  Mira toured the country performing in a popular magic show, acting as an apprentice to her mentor, The Amazing Mark.  Mira&#39;s past, as well as the insider rumors that two of the three original founders have a history of dabbling in the mystical arts, have led some to believe that the serums are magical in nature.<br />
<br />
But how the serums actually work remains a mystery.  The TransFun directory lists a large number of medical professionals and basic science researchers in their employ.  Some argue that these employees just act a cover to hide the magical nature of the serums.  Others, however, argue that the opposite is true.  By using a high profile magician as a spokeswoman and hiding the mundane scientific nature of the serums, the company can maintain the illusion that the potions are supernatural, continuing to capture the public&#39;s imagination and adding  to their allure.  The truth may actually lie somewhere in-between. According to the TransFun company itself,  the serums are created with a mixture of pseudo-science and a touch of magic.  This may explain why the mixtures are so difficult to replicate by competitors.<br />
<br />
Workers at TransFun describe it as pleasant work environment, with caring upper management and good compensation. Researchers at TranFun enjoy an extra benefit: If you develop a new serum, you earn all testing rights, including the right to test it on yourself. Although the production methods are a closely guarded secret, the company has an open and positive relationship with the public, the government and its own employees.<br />
<br />
<br />
********* Your Safety and Satisfaction is Our Number One Priority: The Safety Features of TransFun products *********<br />
<br />
<br />
Authentic TransFun products are 100% safe and 100% guaranteed. There are a number of safety features built into each serum.  <br />
<br />
Insiders claim there is a &#39;magical&#39; lock put on each serum to prevent its manipulation.  Magical or not, no serum actually made by the TransFun company can be altered after it has left the production line.  <br />
<br />
In addition, TransFun is somehow able to remain notified of people remaining transformed for more than a month.  Whether this is by magical means or through electronic monitoring using tagged nano-particles, the result is the same -  no one is forced to stay transformed for more than a month,  unless they choose to remain in their changed form willingly. <br />
<br />
One of the more interesting safety features is the actual flavor of the serums.  The potion in each vial  has a unique taste, believed that to be largely determined by the nature of the thing the customer is becoming.  The serum&#39;s taste has been described as:<br />
<br />
&#39;Thick, cloying aftertaste of rotten fruit&#39; - from person becoming a maggot<br />
 &#39;A fruity, yet salty flavor&#39; - from person becoming tarantula<br />
&#39;It tastes like mint!&#39;  - from person becoming inanimate clothing (leggings)<br />
&#39;A lemony taste&#39; -  from person becoming a Pokemon creature<br />
&#39;Like a steak blended with coffee and a fruit smoothie&#39;  - from  person becoming a custom animal<br />
<br />
The taste of the potions are not a fool-proof safety feature.  They can be masked by mixing them with other foods or drinks.<br />
<br />
Finally, the most important safety feature is the Safety Reversal Feature.  Upon undergoing a fatal situation in a changed body, the Safety Reversal Feature will activate and the user will transform back immediately--appearing in the nearest safe location if their current venue would be hazardous. <br />
<br />
<br />
******************* Product Safety and Customer Guarantee: What to do in the case of an accident *******************<br />
<br />
<br />
TransFun is a professional company that prides itself on safety and customer satisfaction. It has an excellent safety record and stands by it&#39;s 100% guarantee for all its products.  <br />
<br />
That being said, the employees are human and mistakes have been made. Although every TransFun potion always works as intended,  rarely a vial may be mislabeled or a customer may not receive the serum they requested.  More often, the customer makes a mistake and orders the wrong product or fails to read and follow the instructions.  <br />
<br />
In the case of an accident, Forced Reversal Serums are available.  But be warned and be aware - they are very expensive and are often in short supply.  <br />
<br />
If the company is at fault, TransFun will supply the customer with a FRS at no cost, provided they are in stock. If the mistake is due to customer negligence, TransFun recommends the much less expense Safety Reversal Feature, i.e. killing the transformed person and allowing them to return to their body naturally and automatically. <br />
<br />
Slightly less expensive serums that reduce transformation duration are also available for purchase.<br />
<br />
If a customer ever has a problem with a TransFun product, assistance is available 24 hours a day through the TransFun customer service helpline.  <br />
<br />
TransFun recommends that before using any Transfun product, customers should first:<br />
<br />
1) Carefully inspect any product for the TranFun logo and seal of authenticity<br />
2) Read all labels and documentation to insure you received the correct product<br />
3) Read any and all instructions and warnings provided with the product<br />
<br />
In addition, customers are advised to heed the following warnings listed in the TranFun product disclaimer:<br />
<br />
Do not consume if pregnant.  <br />
Do not feed to animals.  <br />
If you consume more than one product from TransFun, be prepared to face any and all consequences.  <br />
As always, read the insert provided with each product for additional instructions and warnings specific to your product. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Mixing different serums is possible but not recommended by TransFun.  Although all serums are safe, the combination of different vials can have unpredictable effects and may result in an undesirable form for the user.  TranFun recommends ordering a custom serum if a customer has an unusual requests.  According to TransFun, it may be more expensive, but it will be safer and ultimately more rewarding<br />
<br />
<br />
************************** TransFun Product Overview:  A look at how and what to buy *************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Authentic TransFun products may  be purchased in a variety of ways.  <br />
<br />
The company does have some outlet stores, most commonly found as kiosks in local malls.  But, surprisingly, one of the most popular methods is by mail-order catalog.  TransFun has a large catalog featuring all kinds of animal transformations. The catalogue is gigantic, roughly the size of metropolitan phone book. Customers who have used it say that &#39;everything which lives or has lived on the planet is in there.&#39;  Despite its popularity, the catalog is relatively hard to find and is considered something of a collector&#39;s item.  Most purchases take place through internet sales on the company&#39;s website. Occasionally TransFun will showcase its newest products in a convention known as TransCon.  <br />
<br />
Although animal transformations are the biggest sellers, a variety of other transformations are possible.  Some customers prefer to use only a portion of the animal vial and become a hybrid of human and animal or an anthropomorphic creature.  Multiple body modifications are possible, including but not limited to: gender switching, changing race or ethnicity,  the duplication or removal of limbs, and size modification.  Behavior modification is limited.  Serums can be made that add more intense animal instincts but there is no serum that can allow mind control.<br />
<br />
<br />
********************************* Additional TransFun Products and Services **********************************<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to its catalog of products, TransFun offers a variety of other services. <br />
<br />
TransFun serums have been used to save lives, in places from hospitals to public beaches, and the company offers courses to train professionals in the use of their serums.  Some hospitals actually stock TransFun shots in their trauma centers, with quick one-minute changes serving as faster cures than surgery.<br />
<br />
Much more popular than their public service programs are the resorts built around the use of TransFun serums.  <br />
<br />
One example is TransFarms, a lush and beautiful piece of property owned by TransFun. It has been described as &quot;a sort of a home-away-from-home for the transformation-minded.&quot; In truth, it is more like a TransFun-run business, where people get to have productive vacations as things like cows and chickens, animals that give something back. The experience is not unpleasant, and is actually quite popular among TransFun customers. The highly trained TransFun staff treat their transformed customers with the utmost care, with their safety as the top priority. But in every other way the customers are treated like a typical farm animal, offering a unique transformation experience.<br />
<br />
The most popular TransFun attraction is, of course, the Pokemon World amusement park.  In 2015 TransFun spent a fortune to acquire the rights to market the park, while Nintendo still held all merchandising and game rights. Visitors can sign up for vacations as their favorite &#39;Pocket Monster&#39;, have Pokémon battles among themselves, or can simply just enjoy a safari like no other. <br />
<br />
Because the park is not always at capacity and not all the Pokemon characters are popular enough to be selected by customers for transformation, the TransFun company does hire some staff to fill the roles of Pokemon characters on a full-time basis.  The high pay and excellent benefits (TransFun even pays housing costs to make sure employees can return to their old homes if they ever decide to leave) insure all of the exhibits have at least one Pokemon character  and the entire Pokemon roster is always represented at the park.<br />
<br />
Because real Pokemon creatures would be dangerous - with abilities like being able to launch an opponent into orbit, showering opponents with molten lava, and the ability to drain a person&#39;s life energy completely  -  the TransFun Pokemon serums have been modified to make the transformed customers safer. First, unless it’s a marked object or someone who’s been transformed with one of these serums, the Pokemon can’t attack. Second, added safety features ensure that things that haven&#39;t been transformed by a TransFun serum can’t be hurt by them. Secondary effects, like petting a Charmander’s tail, won’t hurt a normal person, only make them feel a little scorched for a second. Customers who have been transformed into Pokemon have some autonomy, but, just like their media counterparts, they can be caught, trained and given orders to perform certain moves by their trainers.<br />
<br />
<br />
*************************************** Limitations of TransFun products ***************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the seemingly endless possibilities of TransFun serums, there are some limitations to what can be done with them.<br />
<br />
Although technically it is possible to become any animal, large or exotic animals are relatively rare.  The price for TransFun vials increases with the complexity and size of the animal, and creatures such as dinosaurs are usually out of the price range of the average consumer. Market analysts claim that the cost of producing such serums are not greater, but that the TransFun company artificially inflates the price to limit the risk to the general public.  As one insider put it:<br />
<br />
&#39;Just think about it: If there&#39;d suddenly be thousands of T-Rex&#39;s running around in the cities, that would be total chaos, wouldn&#39;t it?&#39;  <br />
<br />
TransFun does not claim any responsibility for any damage done by its customers. Each vial warns its user to select the appropriate venue for their transformation, based on the type and size of creature they have selected. Most people elect to transform while camping, or at least outside their house.  Seeing as how a transformation could lead to property damage, it is usually a smart and sensible decision. But despite these warnings there are occasional reports of a foolish customer destroying their house, car or other personal property.<br />
<br />
Another limitation of TransFun serums is their inability to transform customers into so-called &#39;magical&#39; creatures.  As of yet, there are no serums that allow customers to become mythical creatures such as werewolves, fairies or ghosts.  While it is possible for TransFun to create a custom serum that allows the user to look like a such a creature (at a significantly high cost, of course) the customer would lack any inherent magical abilities attributed to such a creature.  For example, a person could be made to look like a Gorgon with a modified snake serum, but they would lack the ability to turn people to stone with their stare.  Likewise, anyone looking like a vampire or werewolf would not be able to &#39;turn&#39; or &#39;infect&#39; anyone with their bite. <br />
<br />
Serums are also limited by what is physically possible.  No potion can allow its user to defy the laws of nature or science.  As such, there are no serums that confer superpowers, such as flight or invisibility, as these would defy the laws of physics.  Customers might be able to achieve these skills by modifying an animal serum - such as using a bird potion to fly or a chameleon potion to blend in with their surroundings -  but they would still require the person comply with what is physically possible.  For example, an anthropomorphic bird-person would require hollow bones to physically be able to fly.<br />
<br />
<br />
***************************** New TransFun Products and Products in Development *****************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the current limitations, TransFun is constantly working to create new and exciting serums and to modify and improve its existing vials.  Some of the products in development include:<br />
<br />
Body and Soul: a serum that affects the mind and the body alike. These serums create forms with enhanced instincts.  Customers using this serum would find the instincts are strong enough that they pretty much act like the animal naturally would. Early samples worked with kittens, and featured the popular tagline &#39;Instead of just being shaped like a kitten, you get to really be a kitten!&#39;<br />
<br />
ExChange or Extended Change:  ExChange serums create transformation durations that last longer than the typical serum, usually about a month in length. Longer durations are possible at a significantly higher cost.  Even the shortest ExChange serums are much more expensive, however, and typically require the approval of TransFun representative. ExChange customers are also subject to monitoring to ensure their safe use.  Currently, all serums are eventually automatically reversed given enough time.  But rumors persist that &#39;permanent&#39; serums are secretly in development.<br />
<br />
Spaced Changes: these serums allow the users&#39; transformation to occur slowly, in a series of steps.  There is a significant time gap between each step (usually 24 hours), allowing the users to enjoy each phase of their transformation. They are typically used by customers who want to enjoy an anthropomorphic form before becoming a complete animal (usually so they can go shopping for clothes) but are occasionally used by first time customers a little uncomfortable with transforming and want to slowly ease into their animal form.<br />
<br />
Change Clothes:  a serum that changes customers into inanimate clothes. Users can see, hear, and  even feel everything that’s going on, including being worn.  The changes are one-hundred percent safe and complete.  The inanimate person has no motion—though they will be able to perceive everything their new body can detect.  Sight, sound, and touch come naturally—but they have to concentrate to smell or taste. <br />
<br />
Plant Vial?:  Although TransFun has yet to confirm it, there is underground talk that some ambitious researchers at TransFun are working to create serums that allow users to transform into plants. Officially, plant vials are not considered a priority because customer demand is not high.  As one unnamed employee put it:  &quot;Everybody wants to be animals but nobody wants to be things like trees or bushes, it seems.&quot;  Plant serums have yet to be offered to the public. <br />
<br />
<br />
******************************** A look at the TransFun transformation process *********************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Authentic TransFun products come in small packages labeled with the TransFun logo and seal of authenticity.   Inside the package is a smaller box labeled “For Transformation ONLY”, which includes a nondescript vial as well as a large number of pages of instructions. With animal transformations, separate sheets of instruction are provided for  &quot;Anthropomorphic Transformations&quot; and “Full Transformations”. Custom transformations may have additional instructions and requirements.<br />
<br />
The onset of the transformation, the length of time required to complete a transformation, and the duration of the transformation are all variable and may be modified at the customer&#39;s request.  <br />
<br />
Typically, the onset is within a few minutes, but it can be altered to have a longer delay. For an additional cost, triggers that initiate a transformation may be added to a serum.  For example, some creative customers used a full moon as trigger, simulating a werewolf transformation fantasy.<br />
 <br />
The transformation time is typically between 15 and 30 minutes.  Larger or more unique custom transformations may require a longer time to complete. But even a simple transformation can be extended if the customer prefers a slower transformation. Certain products (such as the Spaced Changes serum) allow the changes to occur more slowly, taking days for the process to reach completion.  <br />
<br />
However, the timing of most transformations can be altered simply by changing the temperature of the vial. Cooling the product beforehand will result in an instantaneous change.  Heating will result in a slower, more cinematic change, intended primarily for the enthusiasts.  For first time users, TransFun recommends drinking the potion at room temperature. Custom orders might not be affected by temperature, depending on how they have been modified for the user.<br />
<br />
The duration of a transformation is usually 24 hours.  Longer transformation durations are possible (such as with the ExChange serum listed above), but they come at a significantly higher cost. The price of the serum increases exponentially with the length of the duration of a transformation, so the average customer is usually limited to a transformation duration of 24 hours or less. In addition, anything longer than a month typically requires special approval by a TranFun representative, and the customer will be subject to monitoring to ensure their safety.  <br />
<br />
After time has expired, the customer will revert back to their human body automatically. None of the serums are permanent, and every transformed person will eventually return to normal give enough time.  But even this may be modified.  Just like the beginning of a transformation, the end of a transformation may be initiated  by a trigger.  One creative couple had their serum modified so that their transformation was &quot;terminated by pulling out after a good romp in the hay.” <br />
<br />
The changes themselves are not painful.  There is no dramatic popping of bones, or surges of pain like from a werewolf movie.  As one customer described it &#39; you can feel the changes happen in your body, but you also kind of can’t feel them.  It’s all of the pleasure, none of the pain&#39;. <br />
<br />
Clothes are not affected by the vials. Anything other than a human form will not be affected. It is recommended that users plan accordingly, especially with larger animal transformations. TransFun includes the following warning with each vial: “Please remember that you transform, not your clothes—we always recommend stripping and removing any accessories.”<br />
<br />
While in a transformed state the customer retains their human mind, maintaining their ability to think and reason.  If using an animal product, the user will also acquire some animal instincts. TransFun warns casual users that it can be easy to get overwhelmed by these new instincts and lose rational control, especially in the mating season.  Other than retaining their rational human mind, the customer becomes the animal completely, viewing the world with the animal&#39;s senses, even acquiring  a change in palate. For example, a user who became a cow loved the taste of grass -  &#39;even the bits that have dirt in it from where hooves have trodden on.&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
********************************* Possible Side Effects of Using a Transfun Product ********************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Short transformation durations rarely have any permanent effects.  But the longer a customer is changed, the more likely they are to acquire some lasting effect. <br />
<br />
After returning from a transformation there is typically no lasting physical changes to the user.  Occasionally a user may note weight gain if they ate a particularly large amount of food while transformed, or other slight body modifications. These typically resolve by themselves given enough time, provided the customer does not continue to consume massive quantities of calories.<br />
<br />
Permanent behavior modification is rare.  However, when transformed for a very long time customers sometimes adopt strange mannerisms related to their former animal self when they return to their human form.  For example,  one customer developed an affinity  for chew toys after being a dog for a month.  <br />
<br />
The most common side effect is what is known as the &#39;Rebound  Effect&#39;.  The Rebound Effect  is a phenomenon in which  first time TransFun users can have a rebound transformation if they eat a lot after their first change.  It is described as follows by the TransFun product insert: <br />
<br />
“Naturally, TransFun highly recommends that our first time users not drink samples around the holiday season, as ingesting large quantities of food after a recent change may result in a rebound change..&quot;  <br />
<br />
It is an oft-overlooked side effect, as most users don&#39;t read the guide included in TransFun purchases. Other customers take advantage of the effect, considering it a benefit.  As one customer put it &quot;It’s almost like a buy one, get one free!”<br />
<br />
Exactly how long users need to wait after returning from a transformation is not presented in the manual.<br />
<br />
None of the serums developed by TransFun result in permanent physical transformations.  But some customers do get addicted their forms, trying desperately to remain changed as long a possible.  In addition, some users become addicted to the process of transforming itself, changing over and over again, as much as their budget will allow.  TransFun has set up a hotline, support groups and even clinics to help customers with their addiction. <br />
<br />
<br />
*********************** Beware of counterfeit products:  Look for  the official TransFun logo***********************<br />
<br />
<br />
The serums are difficult, but not impossible to replicate.  TransFun has repeatedly warned consumers not to try knock-offs, and to look for the TransFun seal of approval.  TransFun warns that imitator serums may not have the desired effect, and are not 100% guaranteed. TransFun has an army of lawyers that vigorously defend their patents and aggressively pursue any company that openly markets a similar product.  <br />
<br />
But that doesn&#39;t stop the criminal elements from selling imitations on the black market. Rumors suggest that some criminals are able to bypass some of the features of TranFun serums, modifying existing serums, blocking the normal monitoring methods and even deactivating the TransFun safety features. <br />
<br />
More commonly, underground TransFun imitation labs release knockoff products which claim to be as good as the real deal, but are usually inferior, with undesirable side effects and unpredictable outcomes.  They can also be dangerous, and have been known to result in death. <br />
<br />
Normally, this would call for a police investigation. But the TransFun company has recruited a special security team known as TransSec that works with the police to prevent the misuse of their product and the production and distribution of dangerous counterfeits. In addition, TranSec assists in monitoring the use of TransFun products by legitimate customers and insures that customers comply with the company&#39;s rules regarding the use of its products.<br />
<br />
                                                        <br />
*************************************** Customer Testimonials ***************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Because of its dedication to safety as well as its dedication to insuring a high quality product, the TransFun company has been an unmitigated success and demand for its products has increased dramatically.<br />

Currently, the latest customer to take advantage of a TransFun product is ........<br />
