<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neither at first could decide who should go first, and after a bit of back and forth, Alan put forth, &quot;Why don&#39;t we both use it? I can experience what it&#39;s like hanging out with kids these days and you can use it to get to know your sister better.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made the most sense to Jeff, and left him wondering why he hadn&#39;t thought of it earlier and saved themselve some time. Nodding in agreement, he turned to the programme, but stopped. Looking over his shoulder, he said to Alan, &quot;Do we want to stay as boys? Or should we try being girls? After all, all three of Lucy&#39;s friend are girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan hadn&#39;t considered this. Thinking he might have stepped deeper into something he might have best avoided, he shrugged after a minute and replied, &quot;What they hell. Let&#39;s go all in an be two girls. We can come as friends of one of Lucy&#39;s friend, which might offer a good cover.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod, Jeff turned back to the Chronivac. Pulling up his profile, the first thing he did was to set the timer so the changes he made would revert at 11.59 pm, Sunday. Hoping nothing would happen between then, as he didn&#39;t really like the idea of spending the rest of his life as a girl, he then set to work on the rest of his profile. Switching his sex and gender to female, he dropped his age to nine, the same age as Lucy, changed his name to Jennifer, gave himself a different surname, dropped his height to four foot four inches, his weight to sixty pounds, gave himself long, strawberry-blonde hair, green eyes, and a general interest in various things he saw a girly. Entering this, and bit of other things he saw rounded out his profile, the last thing he inputted was how he was here with Diana, a girl he&#39;d just met at school, which he&#39;d started attending a couple days ago, as his family had just moved.<br />
<br />
Satisfied he had all his bases covered, Jeff turned to Alan and told him, &quot;Your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Excited, trying not to show he was, Jeff&#39;s friend stepped over and peering at the screen, he inquired, &quot;Okay, so what&#39;s the first thing I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having expected this, Jeff scanned his friend. Watching as the new profile appeared, he proceeded to go through it step-by-step, with the first thing he did was set the timer for 11.59pm, Sunday. With this done, he helped where he could as he coached Alan on shifting his sex and gender to female, dropping his age to nine, his name to Felicity, and, like Jennifer, she also have just moved to town and was coming as a guest of Natalie, another one of Lucy&#39;s friends. Having settled on a different last name, Alan followed Jeff&#39;s instructions as he next dropped his height, setting it at four foot two inches, shifted his weight to fifty-nine pounds, gave himself shoulder-length medium-to-dark red hair, blue-grey eyes, then went through as many options as he could, setting his interests as a mix of tomboy and girl stuff. Finishing up with several of items, he turned to Jeff when he was done and asked, &quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we activate both changes,&quot; Jeff replied and clicking on another option, he set their changes to commence in three minutes. Figuring it&#39;d allow them enough time to get clear of the house, as it didn&#39;t make sense to Jeff how to explain why two of the girls were already there, he stood, made a motion to Alan and said, &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, they could hear Lucy greeting one of her friends, and hurrying through the house, the two teens each breathed a sigh of relief when they heard it was Tanya, Lucy&#39;s third friend and the other two would be along in a bit. Slipping outside and across the yard, Jeff stopped the instant they were through the hedge and in the alley. Holding up a hand, already feeling a slight discomfort in his abdomen, he breathed out, &quot;We change here, then slip back around and wait for Natalie and Diana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan gave a nod, and about to say something, he instead gasped and wrapped his arms around his torso. Neither having expected what they were now experiencing, each turned and stumbled a few steps away from each other. Jeff, thinking the change would be the same as when he changed his hair was surprised it was more then a mild itch. Pressure pushing up on the souls of his feet, whilst something pressed down on the top of his head, the biggest discomfort he experienced as his balls and cock shrank and pulled back against his body the, in the case of his nuts, up into his body. Feeling a strange, ticklish sensation in his groin and lower abdomen, he couldn&#39;t understand what was happening, but would have been shocked to learn he was growing interior female reproductive organs.<br />
<br />
As Jeff&#39;s hair started to lighten and grow out, Alan&#39;s change was also progressing. His privates already reformed to become a girl&#39;s vulva, whilst inside him, his new reproductive organs had started to pump out hormones suitable for his new sex, Alan discovered it was a toss up between whether the pain he was in was the most bothersome or the way his mind was reconfiguring itself so he had the knowledge and memories of growing up a girl named Felicity. So caught up in trying to come to grips with how his old teenage life of being a boy was being forced out to make room for a life as a girl, he missed it as his height finished dropping and his weight completed its shift.<br />
<br />
Each transformation taking no more than a couple minutes, they were both relieved when it was over. Turning to look at each other, Jeff noted how the girl she saw was now wearing a pair of black leggings with metallic-coloured unicorns printed on them and a t-shirt with a unicorn on the front. Struggling to come to terms Alan&#39;s clothes had changed, but not sure how or why, Jeff at last whispered, &quot;Alan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caught off guard when the girl she saw before her, who was wearing what she knew was a skirt-short, which had pink, dark blue, yellow, orange and teal vertical stripes down to the point where the skirt balloon out, at which point they change to horizontal lines, a short-sleeve shirt with a lacy-heart pattern designed into it up by the throat, Alan was confused who they were until they spoke her old name. Slow to nod, mind still reeling, she answered in a high, feminine voice, &quot;Uh huh. Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other gave a nod and before either could grasp the other was going to do it, they asked each other, &quot;Why did your clothes change also?&quot;<br />
<br />
A grin spread on their now feminine faces, and it was Jeff who said, &quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s kind of obvious for our clothes to change,&quot; after a minute, and picking up a backpack a couple inches away, not even questioning where it had come from, she commented, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we get a move on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity Blythe, who has having a harder and harder time thinking of herself as Alan, also collected a backpack she somehow knew was hers and was packed for a weekend sleepover she&#39;d been invited to. Nodding at the other girl, who she was also having difficulty remembering was Jeff, and was starting to wonder who she was, she listened as the other offered, &quot;You go that way,&quot; indicating one way down the alley, &quot;and I&#39;ll go this way. And we&#39;ll meet up in front.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to make sense and with a nod, Felicity turned away. Jennifer Grace, who was also experiencing the same issue, gave the other girl a last look before turning away. Each heading in the opposite directions, something neither had foreseen began to take place. As they stepped further and further away from each other, and there old lives were driven further from their minds, reality began to morph around them. And as they forget the lives of Alan and Jeff, as well as knowing each other, it was all driven from their minds and, for the moment, the lives of the girls they&#39;d become cemented in place as Felicity exited the alley, turned and started walking toward a house she&#39;d been given directions to, but stopped when a familiar voice called of from some ways behind her, &quot;Hey. Felicity. Wait up,&quot; and looking back at the speaker, seeing it was Natalie, a girl she met a couple days ago after she moved here, she smiled at the other girl as they said, &quot;Glad you decided to come. Your going to have so much fun, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to get along great with Lucy and the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
As this was occuring, Jennifer was also being greeted by Diana in the same excited, exuberent manner. Each girl falling with ease into conversation, by the time they reached Lucy&#39;s place, and had been greeted at the door by her aunt, who was staying the weekened as a favour to her sister, the fact Felicity and Jennifer had at one point know each other was driven from them and reality had fully settled.</p>
