<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Keep going&quot; Ashley grinned as she called out over the sounds of hundreds of the hundreds of videos.  She knew that the changes she was undergoing were drastic, but every time she changed she liked what she became even more than her previous form.<br />
<br />
A full minute passed before Ashley heard a response through the intercom.  She had no doubt that they were executing a number of scans on her changed form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remote EKG readings show your brain chemistry has changed.  By a lot.  Are you really sure?  If you go further there&#39;s no guarantee we&#39;ll be able to revert you.  In fact, if we abort now, there&#39;s a pretty good chance we won&#39;t be able to revert you as is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded with her two heads facing the control room... and on the rebound proceeded to headbutt her other 2 heads squarely on the nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow&quot; &quot;Shit&quot; &quot;Aaaah!&quot;  Ashley responded to headbutting herself with 3 different mouths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley!  What was that?  Are you sure you have control over yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I&#39;m okay I&#39;m okay.&quot;  Ashley held a hand up to both of her headbutted noses and confirmed neither nose was bleeding.  &quot;I&#39;m just a little clumsy with my new shape.  That was just a case of not having been born like this, that&#39;s all.  I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.  Stand by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley waited patiently in the middle of the chamber.  Hundreds of videos played around her, and she watched a number of them.  But she also nervously waited to hear back from the chief scientist.  It was possible her clumsiness had just ended her run in the chamber.<br />
<br />
But there weren&#39;t that many people who had been prepared for the chamber.  She knew she was the best prepared for the chamber, simply due to the chemistry that made up her body.  Had made up her body.  Who knew what chemistry made up her body now.<br />
<br />
After a nerve-wracking 5 minute wait, during which time Ashley did everything she could to avoid showing nervousness, the intercom crackled open.  &quot;The chamber is on stand-by.  We&#39;re going to run a couple of quick tests with you to evaluate whether it&#39;s safe to continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Ashley was disappointed by that news, but clung to the hope that the tests would allow them to continue.  Despite the purpose of the chamber being for science and research, she was absolutely loving the changes she was experiencing.  Her current form was definitely the best, and she would love to spend a long time like this.  But given the opportunity, she wanted to go even further!<br />
<br />
A raspy high pitched male voice came on the intercom.  &quot;Hello Ashley, I am Doctor Chalmers, head of Mental Studies.  I did your psychiatric evaluation when you signed up for the program.  We&#39;re going to do a quick evaluation now.  I&#39;d like you to answer these questions as honestly as you can, and how you feel about things right now.  Don&#39;t try to give me the answer you think you would have given me yesterday, and don&#39;t try to figure out what answer I want.  I guarantee, I&#39;ll know if you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.  I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we begin, do you want the videos to be turned off?  To help you focus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need, thank you.  It doesn&#39;t bother me - I can pay attention to both at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley paused.  Doubt quickly spread about what she had said.  What if that had been a giant red flag?<br />
<br />
&quot;It does appear that you have gained a capacity for multi-tasking. When you focus on two things at once, how much attention would you describe each subject gets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I want to say &#39;my full attention&#39; but that isn&#39;t technically true any more.  If I compare how much brainpower I focus with, it&#39;s more than my full attention used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
A scratching sound came over the intercom, like the doctor was writing on a notepad.  A couple of scribbles later, he spoke again.<br />
&quot;Would you say that you were bragging just now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley blushed.  She had never been much of a braggart, and had often tried to be as humble as she could.<br />
&quot;Uh.  Maybe a little?  I didn&#39;t mean it as bragging.  I&#39;m just very happy with what we&#39;ve accomplished, and what I&#39;m capable of like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A hypothetical situation.  Say you were given the opportunity to take your current form and quit the program, with the guarantee that you would never be forced to be changed back to your original human form.  Would you take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;No&quot; Ashley&#39;s multitude of eyes opened wide with surprise at her multiple and conflicting responses.  She had not expected to be divided on this matter, and had not expected to externalize it.<br />
&quot;Uh, what I mean is.. well... &quot;... I really like what I am, and I would really like to stay like this...&quot; &quot;... but the program has done so much for me, and I owe a lot to the program...&quot; &quot;... so I guess I&#39;ll do whatever the program wants me to do.&quot; Ashley rapidly blurted out.  In her rush, she swapped which mouth was speaking several times, but didn&#39;t realize it until she had finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.  Would it be appropriate to say that you have not yet made up your mind on whether you wish to stay this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley used her inner arms to hug her torsos together slightly, taking reassurance in the pressure of her breasts upon themselves.  She responded to the question without delay, while she was hugging herself, &quot;Yes, I think so.  I hadn&#39;t actually thought about it yet.  I guess... I guess I&#39;m not actually as in sync between my brains as I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of papers jostling came across the intercom, followed by the sound of a pencil hitting the floor, and a mumbled curse word.  A few seconds later, the doctor spoke again.<br />
&quot;I am going to turn off the videos.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, the projectors and speakers shut down, letting Ashley once again see the actual walls of the chamber, as well as the doctor in the control room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your personnel file says that you have a girlfriend, who is not a member of the program.  Have you thought about how she would react to your current form?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley paused and a flurry of thoughts fired off about her girlfriend, Katie, and what she would think of the changes.  She quickly came to the conclusion that she had no idea how Katie would react.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought about it.  Thinking about it now... I have no idea how Katie would react.  I hope that she would still love me, and want to be with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you had to choose between them, would you pick your current form over Katie?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question caused Ashley&#39;s hearts to beat faster.  She felt her emotions flare and uncertainty enter her minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I love her.  So much.  If it would mean I could stay with her, then yes, I would give up any possible change from the evolution chamber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind the semi-transparent walls, the doctor scribbled on his notepad.  The sound of the pencil hitting the floor once again pierced through the intercom, and he bent down and picked it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your current form has a larger number of human sexual attributes than your starting form.  Specifically, breasts.  What do you think of your sexual attributes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley blushed again.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s uh, a bit personal isn&#39;t it?  I guess this whole thing is a bit personal.  Well, I like them.  I have no idea if they have a specific purpose, or if they&#39;re just along for the ride, but I do like that I have them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you, hypothetically, stayed like this for a period of time, do you think they would affect your behavior?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked down at her inner cleavage with 1 head.  She could see all 8 of her inner breasts, lightly touching between her torsos.  The constant baseline of pleasure emanating from the breasts bolstered her spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they would, but not much.  I would need to adjust to having them and get used to them.  But I think that&#39;s about it.  I don&#39;t feel any unusual sexual urges or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, the clatter of a pencil hitting the floor came over the intercom.  The doctor spoke into the intercom as he reached down to pick up the pencil.<br />
&quot;I see, thank you. You do not seem to be any more or less attentive since I turned off the projectors.  Do you prefer having the projectors on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley hadn&#39;t considered it, but given the prompt to think about it, she did prefer to be more mentally active.  When the projectors had been turned off, the overwhelming amount of stimuli she was being subjected to had been removed and her actively used mental capacity had diminished to just a fraction of what it had been while the projectors were on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like them turned back on, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any specific reason why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like watching a TV or listening to music while you work.  It&#39;s not really needed, but it just feels better to have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor leaned over to an assistant, and the projectors shortly resumed.  The audio stayed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the final question.  I have been dropping my pencil and leaving the intercom open so you could hear it.  Yet you did not comment on it.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley blushed.  She had been hoping that was an accident.  &quot;Uh.  I thought it was a mistake that you were leaving the intercom on.  I didn&#39;t want to be rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.  Thank you.&quot;  The intercom went silent, and the sound from the projectors turned on shortly after.  Due to the projected media, Ashley could only make out faint images in the control room.<br />
<br />
She waited patiently for the chief scientist to come back on the intercom...</p>
