<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rashad was busy flexing in front of one of the mirrors in the locker room, a cocky look on his older face, hinting at the new cocky <br />
attitude the teen now possessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, man, we gots to get mah boy Dennis in on dis shit!&quot; he said to B, never taking his eyes off his posing routine. His voice and word <br />
choice were still fundamentally odd to him, but it felt so natural, like he'd been like this his whole life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Dennis had been the former Roger's best friend. A typical science nerd, Dennis wasn't into working out, and was plagued with bad <br />
eyesight, a nasal voice that could almost shatter glass, and a thin gangly body.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do dat,&quot; B said. &quot;Jus gotta get to him and then da magic can begin! Ya know where he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prolly at da library, bro. But it's gonna be hard to get him ta come wit us. I'm not exactly who I used ta be.&quot; Rashad had finished his <br />
posing and got a tank top and pair of shorts out of his gym bag. He looked like a champion bodybuilder, mainly because he was now. <br />
He couldn't help but flex and flash a smile at a few of the girls as the four of them walked out of the gym, heading to find Dennis.<br />
<br />
Dennis was at his usual hideout deep in the reference section. No one ever went back there, so he could take his fantasy novels and <br />
read in peace.<br />
<br />
He was so engaged in his book, he didn't notice the 4 bodybuilders peek around the stacks. He never saw one of them hold out a small <br />
device toward him, and he never heard the hushed whispers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure 'bout dis? Not askin' first seems a little mean,&quot; Rashad was asking B, going over the changes he'd asked to be made.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't ask you? You wanna go back to ya pasty white self? Jus' say da word, and I'll make it happen.&quot; B was aiming at Dennis, not <br />
looking at the younger black god.<br />
<br />
Rashad had to admit, he'd changed race without his consent, but he couldn't even remember being white now, the concept was just <br />
foreign. He looked down at his chocolate muscles, flexed his pecs and his arms, and smiled. He was pure African-American, proud of <br />
it, and loved what he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hit him,&quot; Rashad waited with anticipation for his friend to join the muscle bruthas.<br />
<br />
Dennis was halfway through his book when he felt an itching on his arms. He absentmindedly scratched the back of his arm, not <br />
noticing the reduced range of motion of his arm, or how his developing chest bunched as he reached around himself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He turned the page, not seeing his T-shirt sleeves ride up his increasingly impressive arms as his shoulders expanded and rounded <br />
out.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He shifted in his seat as his ass lifted up, becoming granite, shaped by dedicated squatting and endless leg presses. His shifting also <br />
allowed his new package to settle in, larger and thicker than before.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His legs under the desk, he never noticed he thighs becoming impossibly thick as his calves filled in. His jeans would have split by now, <br />
had they not already changed into athletic shorts, still straining to contain the massive quads. His boxers had already become the <br />
customary posing trunks, all new bruthas wore.<br />
<br />
He absently scratched his abs, still too engaged in his book to notice they'd grown as hard and ribbed as cobblestones underneath the <br />
oversized tank top he now wore, stretched to it's limits by his muscled chest and back. As he sat there, from the back it appeared he'd <br />
grown wings as his lats pushed away from his body.<br />
<br />
His blond hair pulled into his scalp, impossibly short, and changed jet black. All the while his face was restructuring, resembling an <br />
ancient Egyptian prince, as he aged into his very early twenties.<br />
<br />
He'd finished reading about proper bench form in the bodybuilding book he now had, and reached to turn the page when Dennis noticed <br />
his hands were dark. He gasped, and looked down at himself, an anatomy chart of bodybuilding perfection encased in dark chocolate.<br />
<br />
He froze, not knowing what to do when the 4 bodybuilders appeared in front of him from the stacks.<br />
<br />
Rashad spoke, &quot;Welcome to da club! You the newest member of the muscle bruthas!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis tried to talk, the sensation of new lips, face and tongue slurring his words a bit. &quot;You responsible fo dis? Wha - Why's my voice <br />
so deep, an why I'm talkin' like dis? An who da hell are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S'okay man, jus chill. It's me, Rash- I mean Roger&quot; Rashad had trouble remembering his old name.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you ain't! Roger's a thin white kid, not some huge brother!&quot; Dennis was starting his mental changes. The collegiate bodybuilder was <br />
learning everything he needed to know to succeed at his true calling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, just like you. Wanted to give ya a gift, so we could hang more. Jus wait - here it comes, bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Der's no way you're Roger, dats imposs-&quot; Dennis finally was getting his heritage. The last bit of needed information. As his old race <br />
melted away into his new one, his African pride swelled. Denzel looked over at Rashad and then to the hulking Cedric, B, and Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rashad, my man!&quot; Denzel stood up and tried out his new muscles. &quot;I don' know how the hell you did this, but I can't thank you <br />
enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you reading back here?&quot; B looked over at the bodybuilding book on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah dunno, some fantasy shit I think. Can't really remember, I need to look up some nutrition stuff, though,&quot; Denzel was completely in <br />
control now. He bent down and grabbed a protein drink out of his gym bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who's next, bros?&quot; B was getting into this!</p>
