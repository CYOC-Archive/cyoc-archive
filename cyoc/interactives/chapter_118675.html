<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ozzy seemed uncertain as he reached up and ran his hands over your fur that You really didn&#39;t want to know what you were. standing on two legs as you also saw a tail that reminded you of a tiger that he then walked over to you and took several close looks at you. he soon gave you your answer as he told you what you were while you noticed your furry sheath that you also noticed a set of furry balls hanging between your legs. you were an anthropomorphic tiger!<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that you have become a breed of an anthropomorphic tiger. Judging by your immediate reaction that you are not very familiar with the use of magic, are you?&quot; Ozzy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;well for one, I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on to a major extent, so I just panicked as I was also trapped in my shirt. two, I don&#39;t really know much about the use of magic, besides a few simple magic tricks. and three, you mean like a werewolf?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, something like them, but like werewolves, they have a hunch on their backs while not looking at all muscular as they do have larger, and stronger jaws with larger claws. Not that this isn&#39;t a goon look for you of course, you don&#39;t really need to get used to having to manipulate the larger claws. still, I suppose those are pretty much valid reasons, personally my patience for ignorance is like a sleeping dragon that if you poke it lightly, it may continue to sleep, but your life is on the line should you tempt your fate by poking it hard.&quot; Ozzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess... this is kind of cool, if you like that sort of thing.&quot; You said while looking down at your furry fingered paw/hands with noticeable claws for gripping. You then saw your feet which were paws in almost every way, but they also looked more human as your legs weren&#39;t digitigraded that if they were, you would somehow be used to them by then.<br />
<br />
&quot;so, Ozzy, can I put my clothes back on?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;i&#39;m afraid that you can&#39;t. they are no longer suitable for you, or your newly formed body of yours now.&quot; Ozzy responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;B...but... I&#39;m naked. what am I suppose to wear?&quot; You asked with a slight whimper to your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are worrying about being dignity, then you are out of luck. Your fur is too thick for you to wear proper clothing, but you can still wear equipment like leather straps for carrying supplies or other equipment.&quot; Ozzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it! you know what I mean!&quot; You growled at him. &quot;what if I were to be hurt by an enemy attack, or worse by, I can&#39;t believe i&#39;m about to say this, but here goes. be seduced by someone of a different sex and.&quot; that was when you stopped when he Ozzy glared at you like you did something wrong. you backed away while being unsure about what he was so angry about, but then Ozzy just sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your point. I should have expected something like this, but that was my mistake not yours.&quot; he said as he opens a book that the page was blank that he also opens up the ink well, dips a plumed pen in it, and starts to write something in the blank page while saying something you don&#39;t understand.<br />
<br />
I should be able to divine it now that I have a familiar.&quot; he said as he then drops the quill pen while getting his wand and pointed it at you that you then felt a surge of electricity energy as it flow through you. The pen was dancing over the blank page in the air that once finished, The pen added, &quot;noble beast man&quot;, and fell the the ground as Ozzy then looks down at you and to you in a tone of voice. &quot;don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you any dignity.&quot;<br />
<br />
when the surge of its powerful energy was done and over with that something felt different about you as Ozzy showed you your newer look in the mirror. it would seem you&#39;re in some sort of armor now. <br />
<br />
looking at yourself as you weren&#39;t fully in armor as you also noticed a few things, like a spear behind you on your back, and a blue like clothe hanging below that when you lift it up surprised you. nothing was under there as the blue clothe was attach like it was your underwear, basically a mix between something you see in one of the old anime of medieval style, and a mawashi (a Japanese underpants). you felt kind of sick of wearing such a thing, but at least you&#39;re wearing something for it as you had to make do, and that&#39;s something you don&#39;t want to complain about as the thought of Ozzy taking your new clothing away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose now that I should tell you about what I expect out of you as my familiar.&quot; Ozzy said, and you nodded and said,&quot;Yes, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;now then, As my familiar, you will be given orders that must be obeyed.&quot; Ozzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m basically like a slave, or a pet to you? Well, that would certainly explain a lot of things.&quot; you said as he soon answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Familiars are not treated as slaves, or pets, but that is a common misconception. you see, Familiars are required to be treated equally as they are cared for, feed and watered, even shelter and pretty much anything along those lines. some are given certain quality above that of a slave, but you&#39;ll soon find out about that stuff later. right now, you cannot continue without a proper name for yourself as your old name will only become a faded memory.&quot; Ozzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I...&quot; you began as Ozzy glared at you like you did something wrong. You cocked your head to the side unsure about what he was angry about.<br />
<br />
&quot;no interruptions. You&#39;ll need to receive a new name just like every other familiar that has ever existed here. you see, every familiar that&#39;s here, and others there will ever be has to have one as it&#39;s the law for what make you ignorant, and what makes this stage for most like me impatient with familiars like you.&quot; Ozzy said angerly while calming himself a bit to tell you why you need a new name.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK, woah, there&#39;s no need to get mad about it. If it is the law, then I guess that i&#39;ll have to adapt to it.&quot; You said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, but for now you will learn. Now I shall take you to your quarters, I will have more for you to do from there.&quot; Ozzy said as you followed him willingly. soon after, Ozzy took you to a bedroom that actually looked kind of nice, or nicer than what you expected of all things considered. There was a straw bed, bookshelves with books, a window, a chair next to a study desk, there was even a closet that was completely empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is where you&#39;ll be staying from now on. should you need anything, my room is just across from yours.&quot; Ozzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;thank you for what you have done for me as I have been through a lot today, waking up in a strange new place and in a cage as you then took me into this place and turned me into this while taking me under your wing and taking care of my needs. what&#39;s more is where in my regards that I do have in thing I should tell you, I do not like to hurt anybody as I am a man of my word and my oath is sworn to valor.&quot; you said you bowed while kneeling on one leg that when you got back up is when you walked into your new room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what did you want me to do while i&#39;m in my new room?&quot; You asked as you turned around to face him.<br />
<br />
&quot;just, get yourself settled in here. we got a big day ahead of us tomorrow, till then, why not read a book on the shelf. it the one on the top row with the blue cover on the left. It should explain to you more about what your duties are as a familiar.&quot; Ozzy said. you nodded as Ozzy then left the room. you looked around for a bit to get use to your new room that You thought to yourself puzzled when you walked over to the bookshelf to see a blue book partially pulled out on the top-left corner, just as Ozzy said it would be.<br />
<br />
You took the book and examined it as it looked well-made with a hard cover as the title of the book read, &quot;The Guide to being a Familiar&quot;. you knew it was the book that Ozzy was referring to as you wanted to lean more about being a familiar, but deep down inside is where something was telling you not to read it. you thought about taking a catnap as you felt tiered, but something about Ozzy didn&#39;t feel right to you. So the question to you is, what do you do now?</p>
