<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben immediately shut up and fell silent as sister Abigail clicked her fingers together. He felt immediately intimidated and couldn&#39;t speak, despite wanting to protest about the score he was given. The fact that he would be sent to &#39;nursery&#39; was clearly some punishment as he was 16, way past the age of someone in nursery. It overall was rather annoying, but Ben didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s been settled, it&#39;s time to send you off to your classes. Firstly, take this map Lucie, it shows you where everything is in the school.  I&#39;d like you to head to the faculty office and meet with Professor Hannaman; she can give you your timetable for the foreseeable future and she handles the students on our special program.&quot; Sister Abigail clapped her hands together and smiled, sending Lucie off on her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Sister, I&#39;ll be on my way. What about my brother, won&#39;t he come with?&quot; Lucie asked as she looked to the flustered Ben, sat on a plastic seat looking towards his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about him dear. I&#39;ll be escorting him to his classes in just a minute. Now you run along now, the professor is waiting.&quot; Abigail shooed Lucie out, leaving just her and Ben in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sister Abigail, can&#39;t you just show me where my classes are like you did with my sister?&quot; Ben mumbled, still somewhat frightened by the nun, asked as politely as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sorry sweety but until your out of nursery, you must be escorted around the school. It&#39;s in case of you getting lost while wandering the halls.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m-&quot; Ben tried arguing but immediately getting cut off by a look that could kill, coming from Abigail.<br />
<br />
Once falling silent, Abigail switched to a more upbeat smile as she held Ben&#39;s arm on the way to his class. Ben did try to make her let go, but her grip was incredibly powerful and he had to admit defeat. Submitting himself to the situation he had found himself in.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only I got a higher score this wouldn&#39;t have happened. It must be because I&#39;m a boy that I&#39;m getting put into this damn mess in the fi- OW OW OW That hurts.&quot; Ben cried out in pain as the grip around his arm tightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t appreciate that kind of language Child, especially one who should be in nursery. What are parents teaching their kids these days.&quot; Grumbled the Sister who had gotten annoyed by the cursing. Her eyes glancing menacingly at Ben who remained silent the entire journey.<br />
<br />
As Ben fell silent, he noticed small details here and there about the school. At first he was too distracted to realise it but now that he did, he realised just how huge this school was. The hallways felt huge and it felt they they were going on forever. Even sister Abigail was huge, easily towering over him like his father did many years ago. It may have been why he was so intimidated by Abigail in the first place presumably.<br />
<br />
Possibly what felt like 20 minutes later, they arrived in front of the door to his first class. Most of the doors in this area were decorated and designed to please young children, easily fitting of the nursery section of the boarding school. Sister Abigail knocked on the door and got a response beckoning her inside.<br />
<br />
Once Ben had gotten into the room, the horrible smell of feces punched his nostrils like a truck. He wanted to cover his nose and mouth with his other hand, but Abigail glared over, indicating her annoyance at the act. Begrudgingly though, this meant Ben just had to tough out the smell.<br />
<br />
The one leading the class was another sister, dressed like how Abigail was. She appeared a few years younger then Abigail, rather shorter and her face was less defined then her fellow Nun. She was however more beautiful and captivating then Abigail, larger breasts, smooth blonde hair; deep blue eyes. There was something that made Ben feel weird in the stomach, and also his genetalia. Fortunately none of the nuns noticed though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, Sister Abigail. I presume this is the new student joining us today.&quot; The blonde nun giggled while she was in the middle of teaching mathematics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Sister Elizabeth. Come on now say hello.&quot; Abigail gestured towards Ben as she patted his back. On recoil he moved forward, stepping in front of the curious students in his class.<br />
<br />
Getting a good look around, he found himself to be the oldest student in the room. While most of the class was made up of nursery age kids, there were some older students around the room. He guessed the oldest besides him was a girl about the age of 10 or 11, but not any older then that. <br />
<br />
One other thing he noticed was that none of them were wearing a uniform so to speak of. Most of the boys were wearing shorts and a shirt whereas all of the girls were wearing sundresses. He did notice that some of them were wearing diapers in place of shorts or underneath their dresses; which may have been why the room stunk of feces.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your name Child?&quot; Elizabeth sweetly asked, smiling and acting overly maternal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh erm sorry. My-my name is Ben. N-nice to meet you.&quot; Ben stuttered, causing Elizabeth to laugh in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww how cute. I&#39;m glad to have you join us Ben and I&#39;m sure our class will be delighted to have you join us. Isn&#39;t that right class?&quot; Elizabeth motioned towards the kids on the floor of her class room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sister Elizabeth.&quot; The class cheered in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful. Welcome to the class Ben. Sister Abigail, you may leave now. I&#39;ve got things taken care off now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Sister Elizabeth. If you need anything, I&#39;ll be in my office.&quot; Announced Abigail who left Ben in the company of Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Ben, seemingly left in the room with the other nursery kids and Elizabeth, attempted to sit down on the floor. Elizabeth however gestured for Ben to stop as she announced to her class that they all could go and play with the toys in the boxes, as she scooted towards Ben who was next to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day Ben, I hope sister Abigail wasn&#39;t too hard on you know the way here, if so I do apologise. Abigail has never really been good with kids which is why she mostly stays on the side with the older students.&quot; Elizabeth bowes as she apologised for her colleague&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh no it&#39;s fine. I-I&#39;m just a bit uncomfortable being put into the nursery at age 16 is all.&quot; Ben continued to stutter and mumble, too shy to really say anything coherent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve had adults come in here before so it&#39;s nothing new. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find yourself comfortable here in no time. But first follow me to the back.&quot; Elizabeth held Ben&#39;s hand gently as she took him to a back room.<br />
<br />
Ben silently followed, wondering why lessons had been called off due to him entering the class. He was taken into a storage room with a desk, a few chairs and a changing table at the far end of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as you might know the boarding school as a strict uniform policy. Down in the nursery however, they are more lenient with us about uniform however we must wear specific clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it the clothes your students are wearing now?&quot; Ben asked, in a low voice. Still intimidated by the Nun. He was still however entranced by her and occasionally caught a glimpse of her large breasts whenever they swayed from their weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes, that&#39;s what the students in the nursery wear and if they still wet themselves during the day, they also have to wear diapers. Now please could you sit down on the changing table as I find something for you to wear. I&#39;m also going to assume that you can control your bladder so you won&#39;t need to wear diapers.&quot; Elizabeth requested in a sweet and mellow voice that radiated in Ben&#39;s ear canals.<br />
<br />
Ben, still somewhat unsure, followed the request and waited patiently for Elizabeth to finish. His feet dangling over the edge as he legs seemingly were to small to teach the floor.</p>
