<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shauna stopped screaming, fleeing the bathroom to find Dan and beg him to change her back to Dan. She was startled to find a child curled up on the floor, but forgot her when she saw the Chronivac laying next to the child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yippee!&quot; Snatching the device she ran to her bedroom, climbed up to her/his computer and turned it on. The Chronivac began uploading to the computer. &quot;C'mon, c'mon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the-?&quot; The little girl did not like what she saw on the Chonivac screen, ALL CHANGES ARE PERMANENT, was flashing in the save bar. Frustrated Shauna shook the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
SYSTEMS ERROR, flashed across the screen.<br />
<br />
WARNING UNIT WILL SHUT DOWN IN 5,4,3,2,1… A terrified Shauna watched the screen go blank. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shauna, I can't find my clothes.&quot; Shauna almost fell out of the chair. She barely recognized the little girl standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me that!&quot; The seven year old stomped her feet, &quot;That's a boy’s name. I don’t like boys, phooey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, what- um what do you want me to call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name, silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ookay.&quot; Shauna took a wild guess, &quot;Dani, I have to do something on the computer first, go sit in the living room.&quot; The little girl looked at Shauna like she had just lost his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll find you something to wear, when I’m finished. Go sit on the sofa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there ae boys in the house!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Boys?&quot;  Shauna had forgotten about Mark and Jay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, inna nother room, inna bed hugging each other.&quot; Dani walked up to the chair and whispered, &quot;I think they're faggies. I don't like faggies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not nice, Dani. Little girls don’t say things like that and the word is gay. Mark and Jay might be gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care! It's not right.&quot; The computer screen lit up. &quot;Okay, okay go sit on my bed. I'll be with you in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Dani skipped over to the bed. Shauna watched as the small girl struggled to to climb up and into the adult size bed. After several attempts Dani succeeding in pulling her tiny body onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now be a good girl and let me finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha do'n?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of surprise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I tell you it won't be a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, please be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shauna studied the computer screen. &quot;Damm!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oow, you said a naughty word!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I'm sorry, now please be quiet.&quot;  Shauna studied the computer screen. Panic and worry started fading away.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS UNIT EXPERIENCED A TRAUMATIC SHUTDOWN. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES ARE IN EFFECT. ALL MODIFICATION MADE WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS MUST BE REVIEWED AND CONFIRMED BEFORE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS MAY BE MADE.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shauna scrolled over the modifications Sean made, selecting to leave Jay and Mark in their shorter, lighter condition. Next he reviewed the lower intelligence and body modifications made to Dan before the incident in the bathroom. Next was the regression and gender change Dan did to Sean, followed by the unintentional age regression, lack of awareness and gender switch initiated after Dan dropped the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why she doesn't remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing Dani.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you go with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you go by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to fall in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won’t fall in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay... Just go to the bathroom and I'll be there in a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Dani climbed down and ran to the bathroom. Shauna smiled, Dan made a cute little girl. Turning back to the computer Shauna confirmed all the changes and unsaved anything tagged permanent.  Satisfied she had fixed all the mishaps and that everything was finally under control, Shauna smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now for a little fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHAUNAA!&quot; Shauna jumped from the chair, raced out of Sean's room and down the hall to the bathroom where he found Dani struggling not to fall the rest of the way into the toilette. <br />
<br />
&quot;I fell in and can't get out!&quot; Laughing Shauna helped the little girl out of the toilette. &quot;It's not funny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sisters?&quot; Shauna thought about it. Why did he say that? Did he miss something?<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Wrapping a towel around Dani, Shauna took her by the hand and led her back to his room and helped her onto his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't move and please don't say anything until I say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oookay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pinky swear.&quot; The girls clasped pinkies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pinky swear.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now don't move and be quiet.&quot; Dani mimed locking her mouth and throwing away the key.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my girl.&quot; Shauna skipped back to the chair and hopped up. <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT CHRONIVAC DOWNLOAD AVAILABLE,  Shauna hit DOWNLOAD.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ten year old girl almost peed on herself. &quot;YES!&quot; <br />
<br />
The download was an upgrade that would let her initiate changes on everybody in the house  from Sean’s computer with the press of one button. But what really got her attention was that everyone Shauna or Sean modified would be submissive and totally obedient to him/her. However there was a catch. One Shauna was willing to take. For the next week, everyone affected would experience random modifications. Smiling Shauna pressed the button to initiate the desired modifications. Leaning back, Sean fell into a deep sleep shared with the others. <br />
<br />
Mark woke up and kissed Jay. Jay opened his eyes and returned the kiss. Sitting up, Mark studied Jayden's tanned Pacific Islander's complexion, beautiful green almond shaped eyes, brilliant red hair, slender adolescent frame and stiffening pubescent penis. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Jayden glanced down at the slender appendage calling for his attention. Wrapping a hand around the tween tool, he looked up into hazel grey doe eyes. Captivated by MarcQuon's flawless onyx complexion, swimmer's physique closing his eyes, Jayden inhaled blond, jasmine scented &quot;baby&quot; dredds. Full lips pressed against his igniting adolescent lust.<br />
<br />
MarcQuon and Jayden swallowed the last of the other's male milk. Reality erupted through the haze of afterglow. Quickly sitting up, each looked at the other, fully aware of their previous adult, white jock statues. Jumping out of bed, they covered their adolescent genitalia and screamed to the top of their lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!!!&quot; Tan and ebony tweens ran from their room.<br />
<br />
Sean looked down in disbelief at the little girl curled up in his lap. She was morphing into a Pomeranian bitch. Speechless, he watched a blond tail spring from her rump. Dani opened her mouth, letting her tongue hang out. Sean listened to her pant.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; Setting the bitch down, Sean stood. Something wasn't right. Ignoring the frantic wails of excited pre-teens, Sean took quick strides to the full length mirror fixed to his closet door. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; The appendage dangling between his legs was evidence he was no longer a she, great. But, Sean didn't understand why he was (obviously) fourteen, barely five feet five inches tall, with shoulder length black hair, styled in a confusion of braids. Two shorter moppets burst into his room. Sean turned to face two angry, confused and by the looks of their respective black and brown erections, horny twelve year olds.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this!&quot;, Screamed the ginger Pacific Islander.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Imma tell maw!&quot;, Shouted the Black youth. Before Sean could respond, a nicely attired lady entered the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;MarcQuon and Jayden go put some clothes on this instance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not another word! Get dressed and do something about those things-&quot; The lady pointed at the boys’ obvious erections. &quot;-before you put somebody's eyes out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't aww mom me, get dressed now.&quot; Heads hanging down the two tweens exited the room. A very confused Sean stood dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too young man, get dressed and walk your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't play dumb with me, young man. Go walk your sister and don’t take all night. After I give her a bath and put her to bed, you and I need to have a talk, young man. Now put some clothes on. Honestly I don’t know what it is with you boys running around the house naked all the time.&quot; Sean's &quot;mother&quot; put her hands on her hips, shook her head and left the room. Conflicting memories battled for dominance in the teen’s mind. Sean knew he was a grown man, that his mother lived in another state and that there was no way the little Asian or the little Black boy was his brother. Walking over to the computer teen age Sean was about to sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean Edward Xavier Young don't make me come back there!&quot; Something in the woman's voice told Sean he better do what he was told. Quickly putting on a pair of tight jeans, a lavender Tee-shirt, a pair of lavender and pink sneakers, Sean stole a quick glance at himself in the full length mirror. He smiled. Pleased with how his jeans accented his butt and hugged his noticeable bulge, Sean grabbed Dani’s- Dee-Dee's leash, attached it to her pink, rhinestone collar and fastened it around her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what's going on girl. Something isn't right. As soon as we get back while mom gives you your bath, I'm gonna find out why everything is so- random. Sean did not notice the soft lilt in his voice nor the slight sway in the way he was walking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be gone too long and keep Dee-Dee away from that Doberman Pincher. I'm not raising any pups!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And call your boyfriend!&quot; Sean stopped dead in his tracks? Boyfriend, what boyfriend? The memory of losing his boy cherry threatened to make him cream himself.<br />
<br />
“Yes mam!” Pushing the memory back down, Sean opened the door.  His mother was still talking, apparently to herself.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, three  gay sons- two  that can’t keep their hands off of each other, the other  in love with a high school senior and  weir canine for a daughter, what was I thinking?” <br />
<br />
Pulling the front door close behind him, Sean wondered how things had gotten so out of hand.  None of this was what he programmed into the Chronivac. Well, except for Mark and Jay being gay twinks, seventeen, not twelve year old gay twinks.   What was up with the nationality switch? Dani was supposed to be a lesbian with a crush on him.  Sean shook his head. He definitely had no desire to be fourteen again. Walking down the walkway leading to the street, two questions pushed to the top of his list of questions. Who was this mystery mother and where did she come from? What was going on? None it made sense. Everything was so random.  Lost in thought, Sean failed to notice the broken window to what used to be Dan’s bedroom.</p>
