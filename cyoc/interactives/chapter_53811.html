<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mom, Sarah,&quot; Rick said in shock as he saw them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here Rick?&quot; Rick's mom asked. She evidentially hadn't seen the collar or that he was naked. &quot;I thought you had to work today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was kidnapped and forced to become a slave,&quot; Rick said glaring at the trader and his slave.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made my son a slave against his will?&quot; Rick's mom said narrowing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; the trader said in a pleasing tone. &quot;You are too young to have a son as old as this man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you telling me that I don't know my own son?&quot; Rick's mom asked venom lacing her words. &quot;This had better be a sick joke. I bring my daughter in here to get a slave and you bring out my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trader was looking nervous now as well he should. Rick's parents were both lawyers and his mom rarely lost a case. The trader turned to his slave and said, &quot;You fool. You brought the wrong one out. Now take this one back and bring the right one out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master,&quot; the slave said and grabbed Rick's arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Punch him Rick,&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
Rick felt a compulsion to obey Sarah's words, not that he needed it. He quickly punched the slave but he didn't hurt him. Instead his hand was hurt and he let out a little yell since he had put all he had into the punch. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he asked as he shook his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come,&quot; the slave said as he began to drag Rick into the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're water Rick,&quot; Sarah said sounding panicked.<br />
<br />
Rick blinked and then his body suddenly became water and he splashed onto the floor. Even though he no longer had eyes he could still see though it was a black and white picture and it seemed like it was just shapes. He could also hear as his mom said, &quot;So you did make my son my daughter's slave. You do know that it's against the law to make a family member a slave to another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he didn't have family here,&quot; the trader said sounding panicked and backing up.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rick heard the voice of his younger brother Dan say, &quot;Hi Mom, Sally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to arrest these two Dan,&quot; Rick's mom said. &quot;They made Rick into Sarah's slave and I believe against his will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have proof Mom?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Become human again Rick,&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
The water that was Rick flowed together and formed a human shape which soon resolved into Rick. &quot;Well that seems to be proof enough,&quot; Dan said. Turning to the trader he said, &quot;I'm placing you under arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a mistake,&quot; the trader said holding up his hands. &quot;He said he didn't have family here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell it to the judge,&quot; Dan said pulling his cuffs out. &quot;I'm sure that if it was a mistake that it will be cleared up.&quot; He cuffed the trader and read him his rights.<br />
<br />
After Dan had taken the trader out to his cruiser Sarah hugged Rick and said, &quot;Oh Rick I'm sorry. It's my fault. If I hadn't said I wanted a slave you wouldn't be one slave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault,&quot; Rick said stroking Sarah's hair. &quot;They made me a slave. That had nothing to do with you. It isn't even your fault that I'm your slave. It was just the luck of the draw that you got me. The trader is the one who's at fault here. He committed a crime making me your slave. It was even against my will since I didn't sign any contract.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I should get you two home,&quot; Rick's mom said. &quot;It's a good thing we have a few guest bedrooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I get another slave Mom?&quot; Sarah asked still hugging Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose you could,&quot; Rick's mom said. &quot;I know it could become really weird having your brother as a slave. I don't know where we'd put another slave though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll stay in my room,&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your brother...&quot; Rick's mom began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is my slave now,&quot; Sarah interrupted. &quot;You know that slaves have to stay near their master or mistress otherwise they get sick. My friends say they keep their slaves in their bedrooms with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well one would be able to share your bed with you but what about the other one?&quot; Rick's mom asked. &quot;Where would they sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can transform one into a doll or nightshirt,&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like your brother sleeping in your room,&quot; Rick's mom said. &quot;What are you going to do for those sexual moments?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that's why she wants another slave,&quot; Rick said. &quot;She doesn't want to do that with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then we should go get another slave,&quot; Rick's mom said with a sigh. &quot;It's a good thing there's another trader in town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon they had a girl named Stephanie from Stan's Slave Trade. Sarah was able to pick her out herself and they were able to watch the blood being drawn from her and being put into the collar. Steph was more expensive than what the other trader charged for Rick but at least Sarah knew who she was getting. They chatted a bit one the way home and it turns out that Steph's mother had kicked her out for wanting to become a slave instead of getting a paying job. Once home it was time to get ready for Sarah's party.</p>
