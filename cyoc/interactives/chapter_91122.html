<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat pulled down her shirt and carefully stood up.<br />
<br />
She stretched her arms and let out a long groan. “I can’t believe I just gave birth to my own brother...”<br />
<br />
“Try not to think about it... The important part is that we’re finally separated.” Dan answered.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I suppose you’re right.” She replied. “Lets go take a shower...”<br />
<br />
She grabbed a clean shirt from her drawer and went to the door.<br />
<br />
She stopped just outside and looked back, “You coming?”<br />
<br />
Dan was confused. “You... You want me to go to the shower with you?”<br />
<br />
Kat shrugged. “May as well, it’s not like you’ll be seeing anything new...”<br />
<br />
It was unusual, but Dan felt compelled to stay near her and decided to follow. He left a few messy footprints in the hall as the remaining afterbirth drooled down his body. Kat had Dan start the water while she pulled off her damp shirt. He adjusted the cold and hot tap until the temperature was comfortable and stepped in. His sister followed.<br />
<br />
Dan was a little turned on by her naked body and excessive breasts, but more shocked by everything that had happened. He paid her little mind as he cleaned and explored his body. It really was back. His arms and legs were there, he was free to move on his own. His mouth didn’t taste funny or feel overly sensitive. He could speak without repercussions. He looked down. His penis hung limp in his groin. It seemed larger than he remembered. Would his mom still think he was a girl? It would be difficult for anyone to argue that he had the right parts for it. Admittedly, his sister had more than enough breasts for the both of them. The thought nearly made him laugh out loud. He was a little disheartened when he realized that he would no longer be able to use magic, but was happy to be back regardless.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, Kat wasn’t bothered at all by Dan sharing the shower. Granted, she couldn’t help noticing his cock. It was surprisingly large for a 16 year old&#39;s. That wasn’t the only thing that seemed strange. He was taller now, about an inch taller than her. That couldn’t be right, she had always been taller than him. He looked different. Maybe older?<br />
<br />
“Dan... How old are you?” Kat asked as he scrubbed shampoo into his hair.<br />
<br />
“Huh?... I... I’m... That’s weird...” He answered. “I’m not sure... How long has it been since the spell?”<br />
<br />
“It couldn’t have been more than an hour or so.” Kat replied.<br />
<br />
“You’re taller than me... Have you always been... Um... That big?”<br />
<br />
Dan looked back down. “Honestly, no... I was wondering about that myself. Not that I’m complaining or anything...”<br />
<br />
“Maybe the spell just matched our ages when we separated.” Kat reasoned.<br />
<br />
She was actually a little intimidated by his height, given that she had always been his “big” sister.<br />
<br />
“Maybe...” Dan shrugged.<br />
<br />
He stepped under the shower head to rinse off. The entire time they were in there, Kat felt something strange in her groin. It was like something was occasionally rubbing the skin along her thighs and vulva. It wasn’t unpleasant but did seem weird since her brother was no longer living in there. She guessed that it was just her body getting used to an unconscious pussy again. She did her best to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Dan was finished rinsing off and stepped out of the shower to dry himself. With him out of the way, Kat stepped under the running water.<br />
<br />
Dan patted himself off and said, “Hey Kat, I’m gonna head back to my room, OK?”<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll see you later.” Kat answered.<br />
<br />
Something was different between them. Dan couldn’t quite place his finger on it, but it felt like they were getting along well. Almost too well. He was glad for it and definitely preferred that over their previous relationship. A few minutes after Dan had left, Kat turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. She dried herself and walked to the vanity. Her crotch was back to normal but still felt odd. It was strange but she knew that she’d get used to it after a while. She wondered if she would ever be able to reach the same level of pleasure that Dan had given her.<br />
<br />
She took a moment to look herself over. It was nice to truly be alone again. She examined the eight breast on her torso. They were perfect clones of her original set, just scaled down in sequence. She gave one a squeeze and it dripped a little milk.<br />
<br />
Kat dabbed it off with a rag and complained. “I sure hope this is temporary...”<br />
<br />
She pulled on her clean cloths. The breasts really didn’t bother her. When she told Dan that it was a fetish of hers, she wasn’t kidding. Still, it was more fun to think about other people having them than growing her own. At the very least, she would cast a spell to make them ordinary looking to outside observers. At most, she’d try to undo them. The chances of pulling that off were slim to none if Dan couldn’t explain what he did. As far as she knew, he just asked her to stop acting like a bitch and forced out some magic.<br />
<br />
“Wait... Was that it? Did he just dump some magic into an English phrase?” Kat thought.<br />
<br />
It was still a mystery, but at least she’d have something to base her research on.<br />
<br />
Once fully clothed, she opened the door and went back to her room...</p>
