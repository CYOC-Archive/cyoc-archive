<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[YFNH = Your First Name Here] [YSNH = Your Surname Here] [YF+SNH = Your Full Name Here]<br />
<br />
You just can&#39;t take this anymore!<br />
<br />
You have been tickled, and tickled even beyond peeing in your diaper to your chagrin. That Fey Monster... Mr. Caterpiller?... Whatever he is. He&#39;s making you feel frail, and useless.<br />
<br />
About two days ago, when that fairy trick you into being in that flower, and that same flower made you overwhelmingly fat, even for your normal sized wings. You can assume they&#39;re not built for holding a fairy of your size.<br />
<br />
And then, being handed off to that &#39;Caterpillar Daddy&#39; who has been touching you, dressing you, feeding you. He even insist on you calling him &#39;Daddy&#39;! Depressed, you began to think... &#39;Is this it?... My punishment is to be treated like a baby. And being tickled to death by that Tickle Monster of a Fairy! All just because I mistakenly called a fairy a &#39;firefly&#39;?&#39;<br />
<br />
Then the caterpillar says. &quot;I know sonny, you want to fly. But let me tell ya, It ain&#39;t worth nothing. Trust me. By tomorrow we&#39;ll get rid of those wings for ya. You won&#39;t miss &#39;em.&quot; You sadly turn away. What would they do for you anyway, even if you&#39;re remotely interested. &#39;Maybe it&#39;s for the best.&#39;<br />
<br />
And after being tickled by his many fingers. Later on it started to die down, and of course he changes your diaper a couple of times already. He begins to feel sleepy.<br />
<br />
As the caterpillar sleeps on the couch, snoring rather loudly, assuming you are also asleep as well. He doesn&#39;t have any wings, you guess he was born without them, or he got rid of them, because of how fat he is, are you really surprised? If this keeps up you too, won&#39;t have any use for your wings either. Your too fat to use them anyway.<br />
<br />
You waddled to your room, &#39;Being this fat is depressing me more, and more!&#39; You think to yourself. You sat there looking at the window through the hole in the tree. Which his home is inside of a tree, seeing the flowers at night which looks bigger to you now. You asked yourself. &quot;Why did you make me this way? What did I do to deserve this?&quot;<br />
<br />
And so you lay your back to the wall as you shed a tear, and closed your eyes... <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
With the window open, the scent of the flowers is in your nose.<br />
<br />
What happens next confuse you. You are sleeping with no desire to dream, but a visitor thinks otherwise. Even though you can&#39;t visualize anyone, not even yourself. So your stuck being in a black void hearing voices in your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;[YFNH]...&quot; You hear a faint voice. You can&#39;t tell what it was yet...<br />
<br />
&quot;[YFNH],... [YFNH]!&quot; You realize now that the voice was masculine, and powerful. Like a heavily build man. And he&#39;s calling your name!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Who are you, and how did you know my-?...&quot; You try to say, but the voice continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, [YFNH]... This, the body you have right now is not a punishment! But it will be if you don&#39;t try to get out of here right now! If you make it out, I&#39;ll give you a proper outfit, made for our kind...&quot; You don&#39;t know what to say really, you wanted to get out, but can you trust him?<br />
<br />
&quot;But even if I wanted to... I can&#39;t! I&#39;m too fat to even fly!&quot; You cried. Then he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can fly, you&#39;re just too scared to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not scared, It&#39;s just impossible for someone like me to even fly. I mean, look at me! I&#39;m FAT!&quot; But he&#39;s not done talking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;[YFNH], you are now one of the race of Rikishi Fairies-...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Rikishi Fairies&#39;?&quot; You didn&#39;t know what he means, but he kept going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Mr.[YSNH]! Listen well, for unless you can escape, you won&#39;t hear from me again... Ask yourself, How does a bee fly? They&#39;re fat too, so how? Think about that, and you can do it. That will bring you confidence... Now... Just one more thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then feel energy through you. &quot;Why do I feel-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have one chance. I gave you a bit of my strength, the rest is up to you. Now, AWAKE!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with a jolt, your eyes shot open!<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
You woke up with this renewed energy that, your not sure where it came from.<br />
<br />
You got up without struggle, but walking with all this weight, not to mention wearing a thick diaper made for your fat body. Is not an easy thing to manage, he said this is &#39;your one chance&#39;, you have to take it! And so with all this, you being to get out of here to make your escape!<br />
<br />
You peek out of your doorway, and see Mr. Caterpillar sleeping, you still don&#39;t know his name, and you certainly are not calling him &#39;your daddy&#39;! It&#39;s time to get out of here...<br />
<br />
The process on getting out is a real slow one. With your body, despite having this newfound power, it still feels like your carrying unnecessary amount of weight both in your belly, and your limbs. It&#39;s scary to think how much space your taking up, or having to squeeze in tight places. But you can&#39;t give up just yet!<br />
<br />
Even with his loud snoring you can&#39;t be too careful! So you tip toed, staying quite as much as you can. And then just when you&#39;re close to your exit. Your hip bumped the vase on the stool! Realizing your plan is about to fail, you try to grab the vase, but you can&#39;t reach! And it shatters. You whip your head to the fat Fey. But he didn&#39;t react. he just kept on snoring away!<br />
<br />
Well, your lucky he&#39;s a heavy sleeper... And so you walk though the doorway, luckily it was wide enough for your fat body.<br />
<br />
Now that you&#39;re outside, trying to remember what the voice had told you. &#39;Think about how a bee flys, and it will bring you confidence.&#39; Confidence? You kinda lost your confidence ever since that fey put you in a diaper! So how is that gonna help you?<br />
<br />
But still you have to at least try, better that then nothing.<br />
<br />
And so, you thought long and hard to make your wings move, you... just...<br />
<br />
And you hear it... Your wings are moving! this is so surreal! This is the first time controlling them, if you weren&#39;t trying to escape, you&#39;d be loudly excited over it. But then you remembered you&#39;re not lifting off your feet because of your weight. &#39;How does that voice, or who ever he is expects you to fly?&#39;<br />
<br />
So you try harder, and harder... &#39;How does a bee fly again? He... He... Huh?&#39; And so you are lifted of the ground, floating! Your-... You&#39;re flying! Your-.<br />
<br />
Then with a CRACK! Your foot landed wrong, and with a loud THUMP! You landed on your big fat butt, as it vibrated around you. Granted it felt like your butt just landed on a pillow, but still it wasn&#39;t fun. In fact you might have broken your ankle.<br />
<br />
You try to get up, and you&#39;re now feeling pain in your foot! &#39;No! This isn&#39;t good! I have to get out of here before-!...&quot;<br />
<br />
But you froze when you heard Mr. Caterpillar calling for you &quot;Sonny? Where are you!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear him calling you! As you got up trying to keep your broke ankle off the ground, you still don&#39;t know how your wings are. But that doesn&#39;t matter! You have to hurry before-!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sonny? Why are yah leaving so soon?&quot; Mr. Caterpillar sees you try to leave. &quot;Do you not like your time here?&quot; he&#39;s tearing up now, it almost makes you feel bad for him. Until you remembered how and why you&#39;re here!<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the reason I&#39;m like this!&quot; You pointed at him. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be babied, I want my old body back, I want my life back!&quot; And then he frowns, &quot;Okay [YFNH], have it your way then. I&#39;ll do this the hard way!&quot; &quot;Wait, you know my-&quot; Then he opens his massive mouth wide, showing you his teeth that are too many to count, then his multiple caterpillar arms in a stands ready to run, and he lunges forward after you. If you don&#39;t leave now he will eat you!<br />
<br />
You got up, you need to get out! Now! Your ankle is hurting, Which is fine. You can worry about it later. The important part of your body right now are the wings! If they&#39;re damaged you&#39;re done for!</p>
