<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early on, God created all the Angels (he/she/it) would require.  After all, God was omniscient (or so people claimed- the Creator never made these claims personally).  Sure, occasionally Angels did stray- Lucifer and his/her (depending on what day of the week it was) followers rebelled, more than a little annoyed about humanity&#39;s place in The Plan.<br />
<br />
But mostly, what made Angels fall was envy for mortal existence.  The (now-excised) Book of Enoch, for example, told a (heavily-abridged and altered) tale of Angels descending from Mount Harmon for one singular purpose- pretty mortal women.<br />
<br />
Though not designed to have children, Angels could, upon transubstantiation into a physical form, mate with human women.  The resultant offspring were the Nephilim, superhumans with incredible abilities.  God tolerated a few of these running around, but in large numbers, they were a menace, and so, after rounding them up and hiding them far from humanity (contrary to popular belief, God really wasn&#39;t into genocide, but their followers could get...overzealous when interpreting God&#39;s commands), God decided to institute some changes.<br />
<br />
Though of course, God didn&#39;t make these decrees personally (despite never claiming omniscience, there wasn&#39;t much point in eroding the belief.  Instead, one of the Archangels, Raphael, was appointed to the task.<br />
<br />
While Archangels are far from the top of the Angelic hierarchy, they had proven their loyalty time and again, and were known to be favorably inclined to mortals.  Raphael gave this some thought, and decided the issue was that Angels lacked gender, which caused them to be curious about it.  And taking on male form typically caused them to fuck anything they found attractive.<br />
<br />
So Raphael&#39;s plan was simple.  All Angels would have to become female.  The Metatron signed off on it, and they were all gendered.  After all, Raphael reasoned, if they really wanted to have mortal children, now they&#39;d have to actually bear the young themselves- surely not something any Angel would want to undergo (at least more than once!).<br />
<br />
What no one, least of all Raphael, expected, was that this would make all Angels quite frustrated, having to deal with hormones all the time, and pretty soon, Heaven was fairly well populated by Angelic lesbians.  <br />
<br />
As Humanity expanded across the globe, it soon became apparent that there were actually not enough Angels (oh sure, God had made quite a few, but many of them had duties to attend to away from Earth, like making sure black holes didn&#39;t suck up everything, and keeping various bits of dangerous cosmic debris away from the planets God favored (Earth was a big one, but there were many others, of course).<br />
<br />
Once again, God gave the task to Raphael, who decided that the souls of innocents could be repurposed into new Angels.  They would be placed at the bottom end of the the Hierarchy (as, since all Angels were created at the rank they were meant to serve, promotions were exceedingly rare- Michael, for example, had been offered one after kicking Lucifer out of Heaven, but had turned it down).<br />
<br />
Now, Raphael was explicit in saying &#39;innocent&#39; souls.  He was thinking infants or children who died very young, but the scribe had been very distracted by how pretty Raphael was (even though Angels can look however they want, all of Heaven agreed that Raphael was exceptionally attractive) and instead wrote down &#39;virgins&#39;.<br />
<br />
Now when a soul is transcended into becoming an Angel, they lose their memories of their mortal life, and, of course, you can&#39;t get into Heaven if you&#39;re bad or anything.  But this still meant that the new generation of Angels had some quirks.<br />
<br />
Amielle was no exception.  At a glance, she looked like a cute 14 year-old girl, a little on the short side.  She had long red hair, golden eyes, and skin like flawless marble.  Her dove-like wings were surprisingly swift, so she was often put on messenger duty.  She wore a simple white tunic that showed off a lot of her pretty legs (still regulation, but really close to the line), and never wore shoes.  She was also infamous for not wearing underwear, which caused a few distractions whenever she took flight (and yes, she WAS a natural redhead).<br />
<br />
Despite her cute and perky demeanor, however, in her past life, Amielle had been a sexually frustrated 14 year-old boy, and this mean that she was, put in very simple terms, a horndog.  Despite her youth, it was widely believed that she&#39;d had sex with at least a quarter of the Angelic population by now (and likely a large number of mortal souls as well which, while not forbidden, was not something Angels talked about in polite company).<br />
<br />
Amielle&#39;s direct supervisor was a tired Principality named...well, her name is pretty long and hard to pronounce, so we&#39;ll just call her Diane.  Diane was a bureaucrat from the moment she was created.  Rules and minutiae were her passion, and she had been content to not care about anything else.<br />
<br />
Upon being forced into a female form, however, she now had to deal with annoying urges that had to be tended to from time to time, or she&#39;d never get any work done.  This is why, on this day, while going over her paperwork, Amielle was under her desk, happily eating out her superior&#39;s Angelic pussy.<br />
<br />
So, to be put bluntly, she was caught off-guard when a Dominion strolled into her office.  She&#39;d never had to deal with a Dominion before- her superior was a Power, so this would be like encountering the Boss of the Boss of your Boss!<br />
<br />
Now Diane was good at compartmentalizing and multitasking, which allowed her to continue working, despite Amielle&#39;s...enthusiasm, but protocol demanded she rise, and her lower extremities were not currently available.<br />
<br />
Still, she made an attempt, but the Dominion just made a motion to remain seated.  Amielle didn&#39;t apparently even notice the nine foot tall nude Angel walk in (and this was probably for the best, as she had a thing for tall girls), and kept on doing what she did best.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a problem and I need you to assign one of your swiftest messengers to investigate.&quot;  The Dominion spoke with the voice of a multitude, male and female voices alike.<br />
<br />
THAT got Amielle&#39;s attention, but, not being the sharpest of her kind (still way smarter than most mortals, but with the common sense and attention span of a goldfish), she decided she should just keep doing what she&#39;d been ordered to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, what seems to be the problem, Lady Dominion?&quot;  Diane adjusted her glasses.  She didn&#39;t need to wear them, but she found they made her seem more intelligent and authoritative (she was wrong, they made her look like a hot librarian, but the effect still kept her employees in line).<br />
<br />
&quot;The Duke of Hell, Gemory, is on Earth again.&quot;  The Dominion replied.<br />
<br />
Ugh.  Gemory.  The Duke was sort of a wild card.  Evil, yes, but more capricious than mean-spirited.  Usually.  Gemory was known to have a low tolerance for morons (which, sadly, included much of the mortal population).  While secretly, Diane admired the crisp efficiency with which Gemory organized her minions, emulating the business model of a mortal corporation, they were, even more than most Devils, talented at exploiting loopholes.<br />
<br />
And as a lifelong bureaucrat, Diane HATED loopholes.  &quot;Surely it&#39;s just another one of her &#39;consultations&#39;, Milady?&quot;  Gemory was also known to loathe spending much time on Earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;We fear not.  She has already been on Earth for 9 hours, 12 minutes, and 38 seconds.&quot;  The Dominion frowned.  &quot;We need eyes on her.  So send someone you trust to simply observe, and not interfere.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Dominion strode out, giving Diane a good, long look, at her toned bottom.  Diane felt her face flush.<br />
<br />
Once the Dominion was gone, Diane gave into her body&#39;s demands, and orgasmed quite loudly.  Once she had cleaned her boss up, Amielle perched in Diane&#39;s lap, nuzzling her head against the taller Angel&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, please.&quot;  Diane hated how she sounded like she was begging...but she totally was.  If Amielle persisted, there was no telling when she&#39;d be able to get any more work done!<br />
<br />
Amielle pouted but gazed up at her boss with a look of absolute devotion and loyalty.  &quot;Yes, Principality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane permitted herself to pat the small Angel on the head.  If Amielle had had a tail, it would be wagging.  Instead, she ruffled her wings in pleasure.  &quot;I need to send someone to Earth for an important assignment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, I heard everything!&quot;  Amielle chirped.  &quot;I can do it!  I&#39;d be happy to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane contemplated this.  On the one hand, this was probably a bad idea.  But she had promised to reward Amielle if she&#39;d made her orgasm (which she had, and how!), and it might be best to have a little break from each other- Diane was starting to have some rather inappropriate feelings towards her subordinate- an Angel in her position couldn&#39;t afford to play favorites, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, then your orders are to observe the Duke of Hell, Gemory, and not interfere with her activities.  Instead, I expect reports twice daily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amielle nodded her head so vigorously it was a wonder it remained attached to the rest of her.  &quot;You won&#39;t regret this at all, Boss!&quot;  She beamed up at her boss.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, get going.&quot;  Diane waved her off, but Amielle kept looking at her.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is an important mission, right?  So I was wondering, if I do well...can I get a bonus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ugh.  It was easy to underestimate Amielle&#39;s attention, since most everything that went on in her head revolved around sex.  &quot;What would you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amielle put her arms around Diane&#39;s neck and whispered in her ear, pausing to nibble on her earlobe.  &quot;I was hoping I could move in with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane froze.  This...was a request she really had to refuse.  Outright.  Now.  But her female body betrayed her, and she felt powerless.  &quot;I...if you...do well...then...yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amielle kissed her Boss fiercely, her tongue invading Diane&#39;s mouth and wrestling with the older Angel&#39;s.  Given where her tongue had just been, Diane was keenly aware she was tasting her own pussy- and she didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Then Amielle pulled away, gave her one quick peck on the cheek, and flew off, giving Diane a good look at her bare legs and little heart-shaped behind as she headed towards the Gates.<br />
<br />
Diane just sat there, breathless, then realized she was not going to be able to get any more work done.  She hung up a sign saying &quot;Back in 1 hour&quot; and retreated to the small suite attached to her office and masturbated, thinking about a certain cute redhead.</p>
