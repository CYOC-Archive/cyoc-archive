<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Nick shouted when his bare foot touched the cold chamber floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick! What are you waiting for?!! We need to run!!&quot; Riley shouted as his friend who knelt groaning in pain. Riley didn&#39;t understand what was happening but he knew that he must do something before the fire reached his best friend. Without thinking too much about it, he ran toward Nick and using his newly gained strength he lifted him and ran away with him under his hairy armpit.<br />
<br />
Nick was in so much pain that he didn&#39;t notice that Riley was going deeper and deeper into the chamber. It was like a labyrinth with hundreds of identical corridors and numerous dead ends. Riley ran a lot, way more than he was capable before and he has another person on his arm. He can&#39;t believe how strong he was now. However, he was getting tired and when he arrived into a big empty room he finally stopped running.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re safe here.&quot; Riley panted as he dropped his friend and sat on the ground. He stared at his feet and got astounded when he realized that he was running barefoot all this time. He put his hands on his soles and felt a lot of dirt and tiny rocks embedded in his rough skin. How calloused must be his feet to don&#39;t feel any pain from that?<br />
<br />
With curiosity, he put his fingers between his toes and felt how the tight space between extended. It was warm and sweaty. He didn&#39;t know why but it was turning him on. He took his fingers out and smelled the rancid essence they got. It was a strong BO that made him ashamed and proud at the same time.<br />
<br />
Does his own smell was turning him on? He raised an arm and sniffed his sweaty armpits to confirm that it was correct. The tent in his obscenely small speedo was swelling like a balloon and he could feel the constriction in his waist. He was enjoying the growing pain. It hurts but not too much. And talking about hurt... He can&#39;t keep ignoring the pain in his balls.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t need to touch them to know that they&#39;re way more bigger than before. It was like his nuts were replaced by oranges. He tried to finger them but the speedo was so tight that it was totally impossible. He can feel them sweating and churning, and he wanted to get them free. So, despite he was giving himself the must painful wedgie he had felt, he managed to pull his speedo down.<br />
<br />
He expected to see a lot of pubes, cause he has already a thick bush protruding from above, but what he saw was beyond his imagination. First, like a snake his cock jumped out and pointed upwards. It was a whole foot long and thick as a can. Riley can&#39;t believe it was his meat. It was veiny and intimidating, nothing like his former nub. The tight foreskin that had caused him so many inconveniences now was peeled down to show of a monstrous purple cockhead that shined with the endless precum coming out from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; He gasped. His own cock was freaking him out! So much, that he had ignored the pain in his balls. When he remembered it, he tried to hold them but instead he realized that his scrotum was so loose that his oranges were resting on the dirty ground. He tried to lift them with a hand but they kept slipping through his fingers and falling on the ground that he decided to stand up. His balls were hanging between his thighs and his cock was firmly pointing upwards. Riley was tempted to jack off at that moment, when he heard a groan of pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!!&quot; He shouted as he remembered that his friend was suffering right next to him.</p>
