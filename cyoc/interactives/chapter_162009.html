<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Stay here, my son.”<br />
“I-I think I should check up on Joe-“<br />
“His brothers are seeing to him. He will be fine.”<br />
<br />
Aku stood up, walking slowly to a chest of drawers to the side of the room. I looked away from his naked form, quickly walking to my clothes, and picking them up. I saw he had taken a bright red , short-sleeve button shirt, a large pair of sandals, and nylon shorts from the top drawer. My gaze was fixated on his immensely wide shoulders. Aku’s tattoo was different from the others, as it clearly resembled a man with a lion’s mane. Joe, the brothers, even Dan, had the same tattoo of a strange symbol, so why was Aku’s different? As I thought about it, my eyes slowly fell past his narrow waist. I felt my cock come alive again watching his ass bounce, as he fit his muscular legs into his shorts. I did the same, hastily clothing my naked body.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for breakfast Aku.”<br />
“Please, call me Father.”<br />
“Right, Father. I-“<br />
“It was certainly a memorable one.”<br />
“Yeah. I hope Joe is OK.”<br />
“I was not talking about him.”<br />
<br />
He swivelled his bare torso to look at me, smiling proudly. As he put on his shirt, I saw it stretch as his hulking body pushed through the fabric. His sleeves made way for his bulging arms. I watched Aku forcibly button the shirt together. I was waiting for it to rip off his massive torso, and the thought of that turned me on even more. He then reached into his shorts, adjusting his huge manhood. When he turned to face me fully, I saw his bulge stick out at least a foot over his legs. The once loose fabric struggled to contain the man’s flaccid cock, and perfectly round butt. The man’s perfectly smooth cocoa skin practically sparked. He was, without a doubt, the most beautiful man I have ever met. I was tempted to start jerking off as I saw his bulge bounce towards me. Aku gently held my hands as he knelt down before me. His excitement from before had yet to disappear. He looked at me like a beggar looks at a pile of gold. I was slightly unnerved by his sudden enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
“Come, let us get to know each other a little better.”<br />
“Oh, OK…”<br />
<br />
Still holding my right hand, he pulled me towards the the large window. Aku grabbed a small piece of wood that was lodged into the glass. It was decorated with an intricate, yet faded, pattern. With one mighty push, I saw the window begin to spin. Like a gyroscope, it surrounded us, the sunlight glaring intensely onto our faces. The glass mechanically spun behind us, and I suddenly found myself standing on the front lawn. Aku looked down, laughing at my disorientation. I turned around to see the window standing as it always has. I never thought I would see such an elaborate mechanism.<br />
<br />
“I never tire of that window.”<br />
“That was amazing!”<br />
“Thank you. That secret exit has existed longer than I have, and I expect it will continue to exist for many Patriarchs after me.”<br />
“Where are we going Father?”<br />
“I thought we could go for a little walk, in the forest.”<br />
“But didn’t you say it was out of bounds?”<br />
“I ensured no one would disturb us. It would be fruitful to have a little privacy, just me and you.”<br />
<br />
I felt my breathing hasten. Aku walked in front of me, still holding my hand. His nylon shorts was riding deep into his ass. I saw a small patch of sweat appear between his cheeks, and the temptation to bury my face in it was stupefying. What’s happening to me? I’m never usually this horny.<br />
<br />
We stepped out onto the front lawn, the grass tickling my toes. As we started to walk, I noticed a group of boys playing rugby. Most of them had clothes on. They all gave us licentious stares when we walked past them, their mostly-naked scrum briskly turning into an orgy. Aku chuckled, tilting his head up to bathe in the sunlight. I continued to watch the brothers writhe their sweaty, naked bodies on top of each other. I wanted to join them.<br />
<br />
“It is a beautiful day, is it not?”<br />
“Yeah, lovely blue skies.”<br />
“So, have you ever had sex before?”<br />
<br />
My heart rate grew faster. I think he could feel it through my hand, since he squeezed it playfully. A surge of hormones invaded my body. Luckily, my raging boner was safely tucked away in the waistline of my shorts. I didn’t want to repeat my embarrassing hug with him last night. I mean, I would love to do it again, but I wouldn’t want him to know I was hard. It’d be awkward. It was awkward. I suddenly realised I hadn’t answered his question. <br />
<br />
“N-no, I haven’t.”<br />
“Ah, so you are a virgin.”<br />
“Yes…”<br />
“Do not fret my child, there is nothing to be ashamed of. I first had sex on my 18th birthday.”<br />
“Really? I would’ve thought someone as big as you would’ve been insanely popular as a teenager.”<br />
<br />
I let my lustful mind get the better of me. However, he didn’t respond, and instead remained silent until we reached the edge of the lawn, standing on the borders of the forest. The grass under my feet had quickly turned into rough brambles and rocks. A small dirt path lead into the forest. <br />
<br />
“Through here.”<br />
“Aku-“<br />
“Father.”<br />
“Yes, Father, Sorry. I haven’t got any shoes on.”<br />
“No worries.”<br />
<br />
I suddenly felt my entire body be lifted into the air. He was going to carry me. Holding me like a newborn, Aku held me close to his chest. His flexed arms were huge, and when I wrapped my arms around his thick neck for support, my hand rested on one of his traps, which tensed, as if Aku wanted to show off. I could feel the power radiating from his incredibly broad shoulders, as he effortlessly carried me through the forest. His pecs pushed against the side of my body, and I quickly began to sweat, as his intense body heat washed over me. All I could do was stare in awe at this giant, feeling his chest move with every breath. Up close, his face was even more beautiful. He looked at me with his piercing eyes, chuckling.<br />
<br />
“You have questions.”<br />
“How are you so big?”<br />
“I come from a long line of tribal warriors.”<br />
“Zulu?”<br />
“Close. My family was once part of the Zulu tribe, before moving here long ago. Our history is rich, and yet is seldom mentioned in books.”<br />
“So this is your family home? And the statues-“<br />
“Inkanuko warriors. Beasts trapped in the bodies of men. We have always been this big.”<br />
“But Joe, he is so different compared to you, and his brothers.”<br />
“You are in love with him, are you not?”<br />
<br />
His persistent smile was warm, and friendly. I felt him hold me closer to his chest. My cock was rock-hard, beginning to tent the fabric, yet I didn’t want to adjust it. I wanted to tell him everything, and so I did. I unloaded my bottled love for Joe, confessing it to his father, who wasn’t shocked by the news. In fact, his supporting glances as I told him filled my body with relief. Whilst the experience was incredibly cathartic, Joe’s indirect rejection earlier caused me to tear up slightly. Aku only listened, holding me even closer when he saw I was getting emotional.<br />
<br />
“I just wish he was gay. It would make things so much easier.”<br />
“I wholeheartedly agree.”<br />
“At least now I know where he got his good looks.”<br />
“That I also agree with.”<br />
<br />
We both laughed. Still, something bothered me.<br />
<br />
“But how is he so different to you, and his brothers?”<br />
“I do not know. Sometimes I wonder if he is really my son. Still, I love him nontheless. However, I see you as a closer descendant to the Inkanuko tribe than him.”<br />
“Really? But I’m-“<br />
“You are small, yes, but I see the Great Spirit of the Lion in you.”<br />
“Spirit of the Lion?”<br />
“A being of pure lust and strength. It is what changes the man into a beast, whose most primal desires become his only purpose. You are a strong beast my boy, so do not let Joe decide who you are. I am sure he will come to his senses soon.”<br />
“Thank you. Father. I needed that.”<br />
“No problem my child. You are part of the family now. We must look out for one another.”<br />
<br />
I found myself falling for Aku. His lips looked so inviting. I wish I had the balls to lean in, and kiss him. I yearned to caress his strong, defined jawline, and thick neck. I felt his bulge hit my lower back as he lunged over a fallen tree. The sudden jolt knocked my hand off his shoulder, as I quickly placed it on his stomach. I felt his abs move as he breathed, my hand subtly running down them. I then realised how close my fingers were to the waistline of his shorts. If I wanted to, I could reach in and grab his monstercock, and that temptation made my cock throb strongly. <br />
<br />
“About the Spirit of the Lion, you must be mistaken. It can’t be in me. I’m tiny!”<br />
“The Spirit of the Lion does not choose simply anyone, nor does it discriminate over a man’s size. I had my suspicions, but after what I saw at breakfast, I am positive it lives within you.”<br />
“Oh, that. I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over me-“<br />
“Yes you do. It was the Lion! You could feel its energy flow through your veins. I have only witnessed only one other person let out a scream as feral, and as ferocious as yours.”<br />
“Who was that?”<br />
“Me.”<br />
<br />
He winked as I silently slid my fingers partially into his shorts, hoping to feel his cock. His crotch was incredibly hot. Thinking about all of that man-meat compressed in such a tight pair of shorts made my raging hormones coarse through my veins. I’ve never been this horny before. Aku didn’t seem to notice my hand fall even deeper into his clothes. Or maybe he did. A little while later, I found myself completely lost, with nothing but trees entering my field of view. Aku didn’t look worried. I was unsure if he knew the way back.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?”<br />
“You are one with the Spirit. You should know of this place, and of our rituals.”<br />
“Thank you for being so welcoming Father. I can’t wait for you to meet my Mum and Dad. They won’t believe me when I tell them how big you are.”<br />
“Yes…”<br />
<br />
Aku laughed, as I could feel his torso undulate wildly. Suddenly, we stepped into a large clearing, with a tremendously huge trunk standing proudly in the centre. It was even bigger up close. The trunk shot up high into the sky, with branches the size of the trees we ventured past. The same green leaves that grew on the archway by the entrance also sprouted on this behemoth, as I watched them glow in the sunlight. I noticed a few large statues carved directly into the trunk. One statue was of a small boy wearing nothing but a large loincloth. He was kneeling down as he played with a dagger. Another depicted a large, naked man proudly showing his powerful frame, as he held a large spear. His erect cock poked from behind his loincloth, that was mostly torn and stretched by his size. However, my eyes lay on the carving between them. Part man, part beast, it showed a giant with his mouth wide open, as if he was roaring. His face was drowning in a thick layer of hair, and his eyes were burning with hunger and lust. His face alone was larger than the boy. I gazed at it in awe, as Aku did the same, smiling as if he was reliving cherished memories. Before the trunk, was a large white tent standing on a wooden platform a few feet in the air. It was bigger than any tent I’ve ever seen, almost matching the size of the mansion. Aku carried me to it, and gently placed me on my feet.<br />
<br />
“What is this place?”<br />
“The shrine of the Spirit of the Lion.”<br />
“Is that him there?”<br />
“Yes. Only a handful of people have seen this place.”<br />
“It’s amazing. What’s in here?”<br />
<br />
I reached my hand out to pull the entrance of the tent open, however Aku quickly grabbed my arms, spinning me around. He was standing, and had brought my hands closer to his legs. I could feel my fingers pressed firmly against his cock. I wasn’t sure if that was intentional, since he looked at me very intensely, with a slight twinge of worry, as if it was paramount that I listen to what he was about to say.<br />
<br />
“Jamie, before we go in, I must warn you. Once we go in, there is no turning back.”<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“To go in, you willingly embrace the Spirit of the Lion, and offer your body to his powers. Accepting the Spirit cannot be reversed. Do you wish to enter?”<br />
<br />
He pushed my hands further into his bulge. My eyes shot up to his shorts as I felt his cock twitch. I felt a surge of adrenaline, as I felt his manhood slowly begin to harden under my palms. I can’t believe he was getting hard! I heard Aku exhale deeply, awaiting my answer. Still staring at his crotch, my voice trembled with excitement, doubtful the Spirit was even real.<br />
<br />
“I do.”<br />
“Then follow me.”<br />
<br />
Lifting the large flap of the tent, we stepped inside.<br />
<br />
The interior was not what I expected. The space was somewhat barren. The walls were made of mirrors, each decorated with the same symbol on Aku’s back. A ray of sunlight shot into the tent from the large hole in its ceiling. Looking up, I could see the mountainous face of the Spirit in the trunk, still continuously roaring at the forest around him. Directly in the centre stood a large pile of pillows, all enticingly soft. As I took another step, I felt the ground become soft beneath my feet, as if I was standing on a giant mattress.<br />
<br />
Aku, adjusting his semi-erect member in his shorts, strode towards the pillows. I followed him, becoming less sceptical with each passing second I spent in that tent. Was the Spirit of the Lion actually real? Once we reached the centre, I felt the ground shake, as the mirrors rattled around us. The intense rumbling sounded like a deeply low roar. I lost my balance, falling onto Aku. Thankfully, he managed to stay on his feet, as I used his ass to break my fall. Like a meaty pillow, I pressed my head into it. I heard him moan deeply, as he suddenly picked me up, our faces inches away from each other once more. That was when I noticed a considerable amount of facial hair had grown on him. His great, sharp jawline was now hidden by a beard. He moaned again, as his voice lowered in pitch. I felt myself rise higher off the ground. Aku was growing before my very eyes!<br />
<br />
“Father! What’s going on?!”<br />
“I am sorry my son. I cannot control it. The Spirit, it-OHHHH!”<br />
<br />
I felt his hands enlarge under my arms as he grew taller again. His shirt rode up his torso, revealing more of his ripped, now-hairy abs. I saw his pecs balloon towards me, causing the top four buttons of his shirt to pop open. Looking down, I was surprised his shorts were still successfully containing his monstercock, which had grown a few inches. The nylon was so tight, I could see the outline of his balls swell, until they were double their size. Aku was grunting loudly every-time he felt his massive frame grow.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! There is no time to waste. I must pass it on to you!”<br />
“Pass it on?! Bu-“<br />
<br />
My sentence ended abruptly when Aku leaned in and kissed me. I felt his tongue enlarge as it wrapped around mine. I swung my legs around his waist, resting my feet on his ass. My cock throbbed as I felt his cheeks expand considerably, causing the shorts to audibly strain. His now-fully erect manhood tented the fabric, and as it pointed upwards I felt it pressing against my ass. I was so pent up from my fantasies of making out with him, feeling his body against mine as we kissed made me cum in my shorts. I felt my underwear dampen from my loads. However, that didn’t stop me, as I felt instantly horny again. Once Aku shot up to 13ft tall, he threw me onto the pillows, letting out a loud roar. Grabbing whatever left of his clothes that still hung to his giant body, he ripped them off. As his shorts flew across the tent, his cock sprung towards me, finally released from its nylon cage. It was over 4ft long, and thicker than my waist! His balls were the size of my head, and as he admired his expanding frame, obscene amounts of precum cascaded onto the floor. That was when his large head turned to face me, his eyes full of hunger. Although I was in unbelievably horny, I found myself trying to flee from this mighty beast of hair and muscle. However, when I reached the exit, a gentle breeze stopped me in my tracks. Aku laughed, the deep bass of his laugh shook the ground. His voice was so low it was almost unintelligible when he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yessssss….Feel the Lion!”<br />
“Woah, that’s….this is impossible!”<br />
<br />
Dashing to a mirror, I saw I had grown the beginnings of a beard. The breeze tickled the hairs as they grew. Shocked, I continued staring at my face, until I felt a weird sensation throughout my entire body. It felt good, like a million hands were gently rubbing every part of me. Looking down, I noticed that I had grown over a foot! I saw my cock lengthen in my shorts. Feeling my balls swell with cum caused me to moan, stopping suddenly as I realised my voice had dropped heavily. <br />
<br />
“Oh God, what is happening to me?! AHHH-“<br />
<br />
That was when I felt two giant hands grab my ass as it expanded and grew more sensitive. Aku towered over me, now a 15ft beast. I gulped as I saw his 5ft cock swing in front of my face, large splotches of his seed splashing onto me. I looked up to see him grinning wildly.<br />
<br />
“You are ready.”<br />
“But Father I-OH!”<br />
<br />
Being lifted into the air once again, Aku took me back onto the pillows. He pressed his huge chest onto my body, grinding his manhood on the floor. I eventually gave into my lustful desires, quickly taking off my clothes, and eagerly making out with him. I knew what was going to come next, and Aku was right. I was more than ready, I was dying for it. Feeling a new surge of power within me, I screamed at the top of my lungs.<br />
<br />
“Do it Father! I’m ready-OHHHH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Just as I grew again, surpassing 8ft, Aku rammed his cock deep into my ass. I yelped in pain as the man’s meat traveled deeper in my body. The orgasmic sensations of being fucked by such a behemoth was overwhelming. Not only that, but feeling the Spirit of the Lion grow stronger inside me opened my mind up to a whole new level of pleasure. I had never felt anything like this before. I doubt most people had, or ever will. All I could do was scream excitedly as Aku thrusted another foot of his monster into me. I was too lost in this new world of pleasure to speak. I felt a huge spurt of my precum spray my expanding chest. My balls had grown so big, so full, I was desperate to cum. So was Aku, as I felt his thrusts become deeper. He was almost balls-deep as he let out a low growl.<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT! THIS FEELS AMAZING!”<br />
“Ohhhh fuck! You’re lucky boy. Most of my sons could only feel my cock inside them. You have the honour of having the Great Spirit inside you as well. ARGHHH!”<br />
<br />
He grew again, to 17ft. Feeling his meaty shaft swell inside me caused my cock to unleash another load of precum, landing mostly on my powerfully thick traps. I could feel my new muscles flex, including my ass, which tensed around Aku’s cock. The sudden tightness made the man moan loudly, as he pushed more of his length between my cheeks. Precum flooded from his cock like a waterfall, continuously filling me up. However, I could feel my body absorb his seed, as a warm feeling spread across my chest. Still physically overwhelmed by the intense surges of pleasure, I looked up through the gap in the roof, only to see the huge carving of the Spirit of the Lion look down on me, grinning.  Looking into the eyes of the statue, I suddenly felt myself grow again. My pecs rose from my chest like two muscular hills. I saw my own cock grow, as it leaned over me. I continued to grow until I was around Jim’s height, at 9ft tall. I watched large patches of hair spread across my body. I looked completely unrecognisable as I stared at my new form in a mirror. I couldn’t help but flex my biceps, which were now the size of bowling balls.<br />
<br />
“I’M HUGE! FATHER…..Father?”<br />
<br />
<br />
He didn’t respond. All I heard from him were animalistic grunts that pierced my ears. He looked at me as if I was a total stranger. So caught up in his own primal lust, he had lost sense of who he was. Sweat poured off his body, coating me with his juices. All I could smell was his bestial scent as he pushed another foot of his cock into me.<br />
<br />
“Oh God-UHHHH-HOLY SHIT!”<br />
<br />
My voice suddenly dropped, like at breakfast. However, this time it stayed at that pitch. The hair on my face thickened, as I felt my mind become fuzzy. In that moment, I completely forgot who I was. I couldn’t remember Joe, the mansion, or even my family. I couldn’t even remember my name. All I knew was that I needed to cum. That was my only goal. I looked up at the beast who was still fucking me wildly, as my eyes burned with undying ardour. Reaching my hands around the back of the man’s head, I forcibly shoved it onto my cock, roaring in pleasure as I felt my it slide deep into his throat. Just as I did that, Aku had fit his entire length into my ass, and with every deep thrust I felt his balls slap against my cheeks. They twitched, as did mine. I could tell I was close.<br />
<br />
“TAKE IT! ALL OF IT! ARGHHHHH!”<br />
<br />
And so, with one mighty bellow that violently shook the tent, I thrusted my cock further into Aku’s mouth as I came. He tried to swallow my loads, as I felt heavy amounts of my cum leak from his mouth, and onto my chest, drowning me in my own seed. The orgasm was seemingly endless. The sheer intensity of my climax caused my asscheeks to tense firmly around the man’s length. That was when I felt his cock throb massively, and as he lifted his head up from my still-ejaculating cock, he opened his mouth wide and roared a deafeningly, ferocious roar. It was like the beasts inside us had complete control of our bodies, and our minds. He came a thick, continuous stream, which filled my large frame. As I felt gallons of his cum absorb into me, his loads spread across my entire body. I could feel it in my veins, like it was alive. The beast within me had subsided, as I regained control of my mind. Alas, before I could make any sense of it, I began to pass out from exhaustion.<br />
<br />
After that, everything was a blur. I don’t remember the rest of that day. We must have been fucking for hours, because as I felt Aku carry me back to the mansion, I saw it had become dark. I drifted in and out of consciousness, feeling his warm chest against my naked body. The very last thing I remember was Aku gently placing me on my bed, beside Joe who was sleeping. As I felt a soft kiss on the forehead, I passed out completely.</p>
