<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel tilted her head back and greedily drank from the stein.  She stopped and smacked her lips.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  It tastes ..... different, &quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
Julie reached for the stein. &quot;Sorry, I will throw that one away and make another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel pulled the stein back towards her, cupping it and shielding it protectively.  &quot;NO!  I didn&#39;t say it was bad.  Just different.  I kind of like it, &quot; she said.  She began to guzzle down the new mixture.<br />
<br />
As she drank, Julie noticed that Rachel&#39;s skin started to feel strange.  It was getting softer, and a little sticky and wet.  She looked down and saw her legs kind of sinking into Rachel&#39;s belly.  Julie didn&#39;t like the feeling and quickly got off of Rachel&#39;s belly and out of her massive lap.  <br />
<br />
Rachel didn&#39;t seem to notice, and kept chugging the strange mixture.  She finished her drink with a large burp that sent her belly into a quivering fit, as it shook like Jell-O.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, excuse me, &quot; said Rachel with a smile.  She looked over her body and didn&#39;t see any change.  She looked about the same size.  &quot;I don&#39;t think you used the right chocolates.  I didn&#39;t get any bigger.  But for some reason I am really hungry. I left a sandwich on my desk.  Can you get it for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie complied and handed Rachel the sandwich.  Her hand came away with a slimy ooze.  Julie wiped the liquid on her pant leg. It had caused a burning irritation on her hand.  She watched in shock as Rachel swallowed the sandwich whole.  Julie realized she could see the sandwich through Rachel&#39;s skin, and followed it as it slowly made its way down to her belly.  It was like her skin was translucent, and she could see the sandwich slowly dissolving inside her.<br />
<br />
Rachel patted her belly hard, sending some small drops of the strange slime flying across the room.  Julie was careful to avoid it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that was good.  But I am still hungry.  I think there is some leftover pizza under the bed. Can you get it?&quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that is a good idea.  That last chocolate has had some kind of weird effect on you.  I think we better try to reverse it first, &quot; said Julie nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, relax.  I feel fine. Pretty good actually.  But I&#39;m just so hungry.  I can hardly think.  Just give me some more food first, &quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
Julie stood up and began to back away, shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, &quot; moaned Rachel.  &quot;You don&#39;t understand how hungry I am.  I need to eat.  I thought this was what you wanted. For me to be your big, fat girl.  Fine, I will just get it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel tilted her body and rolled on her side.  Her flesh sloshed as she turned, and seemed to drip down her sides.  She reached a meaty hand under the bed and pulled out the box.  She rolled the pizza, and stuffed the whole thing down her throat.  She moaned as the pizza  was dissolved inside her belly.  It seemed like it occurred more quickly this time to Julie.  Rachel&#39;s skin looked even more translucent, wet, and slimy.  And she could swear that Rachel even got a little bit bigger.  Her shirt seemed to be sinking into her body as her flesh ballooned around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;More, I need more, &quot; said Rachel, as she desperately looked around for food.<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn&#39;t any more.  I&#39;ll go down stairs and get something from the kitchen,&quot; said Julie.  The chocolates were still downstairs, and she was hoping she could work up some kind of antidote.<br />
<br />
&quot;No time.  I need something now, &quot; said Rachel, as she spotted her small fish bowl.  She reached over and grabbed it, sticking her hand in the bowl.  The water was directly absorbed through her hand, taking the small fish inside with it.  The fish seemed to swim through her body, searching desperately for an escape.  But it was soon dissolved in her body, still wriggling and struggling as it died.   Julie looked away in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  It&#39;s only an animal.  We eat fish all the time!  Don&#39;t act so superior to me.  You would have done it, too, if you felt this hungry, &quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
Julie said nothing, and continued to back away.  Rachel started to move forward, gliding across the floor leaving a trail of slime behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?  You are acting like I am some kind of monster or something!  It&#39;s still me, your friend Rachel,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s cat made the mistake of walking too close to her.  Tendrils of slime shot out from her body like tentacles, and pulled the creature into her body.  It struggled to free itself, but each time it broke free more tendrils would pull it back in.  Rachel seemed oblivious.  She closed her eyes and moaned, as the cat was slowly dissolved.  Rachel opened her eyes and put her hand over her mouth and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoops, that was a mistake, &quot; said Rachel with a smile.  But to Julie it didn&#39;t look like a mistake.  It looked like Rachel enjoyed it.  &quot;Guess I need a new cat.  But it was kind of its own fault for getting too close when I am so hungry.  It should have been more careful. Silly little cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie was horrified, but thankfully she could feel the door behind her.  Rachel continued to move towards her, angry at her friend&#39;s reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Stop looking at me like that!  I said it was a mistake.  It&#39;s not like I would do that to you. Or anyone else for that matter,&quot; said Rachel.<br />
<br />
As she continued to move closer small tendrils of slime snaked out of her body, probing the things lying around her room.  It looked like they were searching for more food. Julie didn&#39;t know if Rachel was controlling them or not, but she didn&#39;t care.  They were getting entirely too close, and she needed to get out of there.  Suddenly, one of the tentacles found the second stein that Rachel had intended for Julie to drink.  It reached inside and quickly absorbed the milkshake.<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s eyes went wide as the solution was slowly dissolved into her body.  She closed her eyes and moaned as she changed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh yes.  So good, so good, &quot; she said as she rubbed her hands across her slimy body.  Her body began to balloon even larger.  Her shirt completely sank into her body, as the slimy flesh expanded around it, enclosing it in her chest.  Her body began to loose definition as it got larger, looking less human and more like a slimy liquid.  It was almost like she was melting.  <br />
<br />
Julie didn&#39;t wait around to ask what Rachel had put in that milkshake.  She just opened the door and ran out the room.  She could hear the floor creak as Rachel continued to grow and change.</p>
