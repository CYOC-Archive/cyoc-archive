<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back track to Jeremy.... <br />
<br />
After receiving the necessary information from Julie Stovall, who had no idea who she was just speaking to, Jeremy made his way down the street. He caught sight of a father and son walking in the same direction as him. Jeremy kept his distance, wondering who they were. The older man was a werefox, but the boy normal. But they both smelled like another werefox (female?), and a werewolf. <br />
<br />
“Maybe neighbors?&quot; he thought. Jeremy decided to head back into town, and wait until later in the day to make his move. He didn’t even know if Spencer was at home now. But at night, she’d most likely be asleep in bed. There’s no way her father would let her out. This was Evan Lawson. The man who sent a 2 billion dollar drone after the two when they went on a date. <br />
<br />
“Hey, you lost man?” Jeremy turns around and sees a boy with brown hair driving a silver sedan. Another werewolf. <br />
<br />
“Uh, no just thinking. Don’t mind me, just passing through.” Jeremy said quickly, turning around and heading back towards town.<br />
<br />
Alex watches as Jeremy’s figure grows smaller and smaller in the distance. He’s a were, some sort of dog he thinks. But he doesn’t dwell on it. The man is leaving. <br />
<br />
“But if i see him again, I’ll keep an eye on him. There’s something OFF about him,” Alex thought. He continued down the street, slowing only when he sees Eric and his father walking. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Hey! Eric! Mr. Anderson!” <br />
<br />
Alex Ramsey waved from his car. He slowed and pulled up along side them.<br />
<br />
“Want a ride?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“We’re only a few blocks away from the Lawson’s house?” Eric said. William nudged him and thanked Alex for the offer. <br />
<br />
“You go on ahead of us, we’ll be there in a minute or two.” William said. Alex nodded, and continued down the street. Eric and William kept a brisk pace, and by the time they reached the Lawson’s, Alex was at the doorway ringing the bell. It wasn’t Evan, Maggie, or even Spencer who answered the door. Jonathan Danvers, Maggie’s brother in law, answered the door.<br />
<br />
A six foot tall, somewhat lanky, weretiger stood in the doorway. His light brown hair was combed away from his face, and his green eyes had a somewhat feline look to them, even in his normal form.<br />
<br />
“You’re Alex?” Jonathan asked.<br />
<br />
“Ya. And you are…?” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“Jonathan Danvers. Spencer’s uncle. Nice to meet you.” he said, offering a hand. Then Jonathan caught sight of William and Eric coming up the driveway.<br />
<br />
“William and Eric?” Jonathan asked, stepping aside to let Alex inside the house.<br />
<br />
“Yes. it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thanks for letting us…”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t thank me for anything. Having extra hands and able bodies if always a good thing. And it’s nice to know Spencer’s made some friends.” Jonathan cut William off mid-sentence. He lets the two in, and Eric the difference between Jonathan and Evan. The two are polar opposites, that’s what Spencer told him. But not just in species, werewolf vs weretiger. <br />
<br />
Jonathan grew up in a similar were-based town in California. He then went to Moon Lake Community College, one of the few schools that was in a were-friendly town. Maybe it was his California lifestyle, but Jonathan was the most carefree person Spencer knew. <br />
<br />
“The Andersons and Alex are here!” Jonathan calls into the house. Evan and Maggie are in the kitchen with Elle. They go to greet the others, and both Anderson men are surprised at how attractive Maggie’s sister is. Eric sees more of Spencer in Elle than her mother. The jet black hair, long torso, and devilish smile, Eric gets the feeling that’s what Spencer will look like in say twenty or so years. More or less. <br />
<br />
“Hello, I’m Elle Danvers, Maggie’s sister.” she says in a soft and sweet voice. William and Eric shake her hand, and then Alex. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you.”<br />
<br />
“I hope you won’t be too bored. The guys can get rather absorbed in their ‘toys’.” Elle said, looking at her husband. <br />
<br />
“They are no more toys than your collection of…”<br />
<br />
“Do you want something to eat or drink? We just started a pot of coffee, and we started making lunch.” Elle said quickly, stopping Jonathan from finishing his sentence. <br />
<br />
William nods yes to coffee, sparing Elle of an embarrassing moment. As Elle guides him into the kitchen with Maggie and Evan, she kicks her husband in the shin. Jonathan follows, wincing all the while.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Spencer?” Eric wonders aloud. <br />
<br />
“Up here!” Spencer shouts from her bedroom. The two boys hesitate to go up, until Spencer yells at them to get the rocks out of their pants and move it. <br />
<br />
“It’s not like you’ve never seen a naked girl before.” she teases them. That gives Eric more of an incentive to go up than Alex. But Alex follows mostly because he doesn’t want to be left alone. Eric and Alex look around the house, both have never been upstairs before (Alex never in the Lawson’s house period). It’s pretty much a carbon copy of the Anderson’s. Changes in wall color, furnishing, and some minor layout differences, but otherwise it’s the same. <br />
<br />
“Spencer’s room is where Nate’s would be.” Eric thinks. Her door is wide open, TV laughter spilling out into the hallway. Spencer’s digging around in her closet for a clean shirt, in nothing but matching blue underwear. <br />
<br />
“Wow, give a guy a warning!” Alex says, averting his eyes. He looks at Eric, who seems spellbound by Spencer’s butt. He covers Eric’s eyes for him.<br />
<br />
“You guys are such prudes.” Spencer says, buttoning her jeans<br />
<br />
“I like to think myself chivalrous.” Alex said, his eyes still closed. <br />
<br />
“Well, you can open your eyes now. I’m dressed.” Spencer says, tugging her shirt over her head. When Eric and Alex open their eyes, Spencer is wearing a beat-up black t-shirt and a pair of equally beat-up jeans. <br />
<br />
Eric looks around Spencer’s bedroom. It’s a blue-gray, still fairly barren since she hadn’t had time to personalize it yet. She’s put up a few posters, some of bands Eric’s never heard of, some black and white photography of wild animals. Mostly wolves and big cats. A few tigers, a couple of lions, and three large spotted leopards. The TV has an episode of “Firefly”. Eric’s heart pumps twice as hard in his chest. <br />
<br />
“She even likes Firefly!” he thinks elated. <br />
<br />
“Nice decor.” Alex said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks. So, what do you want to do? Dad and Uncle Jon won’t go back into the garage until after they finish eating.” <br />
<br />
“Got any video games?” Alex asks.<br />
	<br />
“Everything from Mario to Halo.” Spencer said, once again bending over to rummage in her closet. Alex nudges Eric, and looks pointedly at Eric’s pants. Eric sees what Alex is trying to tell him, and he quickly sits on the floor in front of Spencer’s bed. He does his best to cover the erection, without causing himself too much discomfort. Spencer pretends not to notice for Eric’s sake.<br />
<br />
“Poor guy. Maybe I should find him some normal girl, just until he makes a decision about becoming a were. Or at least, what kind since he’s all but said he wants to make the change eventually. But the guy can’t run around getting hard every other minute.” Spencer thinks. She stands up straight and holds up to games.<br />
<br />
“So, what’ll it be? Blowing up insurgents or Koopa Troopas?”</p>
