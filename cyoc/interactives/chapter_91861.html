<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sartari and I quietly made our way down from the workout room, which was on a level above the barracks with a flight of stairs linking the barracks we were in to it, and went through a door opposite the entrance area to the bathroom and showers area in the locker room portion of the barracks. I also noticed that in the exercise room that there were a few other doorways that lead into it. I figured they lead into other barracks that were under different Captains, as Lartara couldn&#39;t be the only one in the facility. I was a little bit ashamed that I&#39;d never noticed it when I was brought in, but then I was also a bit frightened and nervous at that time. The barracks smelled heavily of Lycothan musk, and while I knew it and was used to it, the strength of it in the barracks was enough to make me notice when I was only Haley. And at the same time I was reacting heavily to sexually forward tone that Eira had used in her interaction with me. As a human and as firmly heterosexual human, I probably missed it as I tried to process everything that was going on.<br />
<br />
Though, now, things had obviously changed. I was a Warrior, and my scent was just as musky as the other girls were. I was just as naked as the others were, and as Lartara had told me before I changed, that I would change in many ways as well. I had found all my sisters beautiful, in both their forms, I had engaged in many of the same sexual teasing that Eira had engaged in when I came in, and I engaged in it with Eira. I had affectionately licked her muzzle while we had been in the forest, and I had just willingly accepted a kiss from Sartari and followed every move she made with my eyes, and I did have to admit to myself that it wasn&#39;t to see where she kept her warhammer. There some fantasies that went through my mind regarding male Warriors as well, but many of them also centered around one or two males pleasuring ALL of us and our enjoying our own company while waiting for our turns with that individual male Warrior. In that, I knew that I either had become or was becoming just as bisexual as Lartara had described Lycothan females.<br />
<br />
Though at the moment that wasn&#39;t entirely what I was thinking on. Much of that had more to do with what Sartari had said to me regarding how they determined where Warriors went. Those stationed here in these sorts of facilities had to prove that they could be trusted not to abuse human prisoners. That gave my human mind some comfort that their policy wouldn&#39;t allow abuse, but then I also remembered what that Alpha was willing to do to Casey, which I still saw as abusive, and at the same time it made me think about what would happen if and when I interacted with prisoners, particularly Amanda and Casey, who outside of Emily, had been the ones I&#39;d been able to spend the most time with whenever I was out of my cell as a prisoner. But now, I was a Lycothan Warrior and very different from what I looked like as a human and I wouldn&#39;t go back to being human even if I could.<br />
<br />
And that created mixed thoughts. I wanted them to accept what I was now and recognize what I was now, and that I had no problem in showing what I was now, but at the same time, I didn&#39;t want them to fear me. I wanted them to understand that despite all my changes, I would protect them and I would not force the change on them if they didn&#39;t want it. However, I didn&#39;t know how I was going to go about proving that to them. There would probably be some rules I&#39;d have to follow in terms of interacting with prisoners, and given what Lartara had told me before my last recruiting session, saying that I still remembered being Haley probably wasn&#39;t the wisest thing to do. So, I was at a loss as to what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do well with basic training,&quot; Sartari urged again as we turned from the stairs to move to the recreation room in the barracks, &quot;and then we&#39;ll talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; I gave a slight smile, as I did intend to do that and did look forward to warhammer training, but my confidence on how well I&#39;d do was still rather low at the moment. However, the only one who could probably help me with the confidence issue would be Lartara, as she was the only other one who remembered who she was that I knew of.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all we can do,&quot; Sartari nodded and we walked into the recreational room.<br />
<br />
The others were in the room as we entered. Raksha, Verozza, Tarrgh, and Nyl were seated around one gaming table and seemed to be engaged in what looked like a game of cards. Lesroia, Marrh, and Eira were seated on the couch watching the television. It seemed to be showing the news, as I could see a pair of Servant Lycothans in their more human form seated behind the news desk. I noted that their heads were both completely shaved. They did not even have the warrior&#39;s crest that the others had or that I would have. What marked the white stripe was actually a mark of a deep suntanned skin tone. Much of their skin was bronzed heavily, as though they&#39;d been out in the sun for a very long time, but with the a portion on their head being very pale, almost as though the skin was white by comparison to the skin around it. The reporter on the right had this mark running in twin streaks above his eyes while the other had it in a single stripe going from her nose and going up and over her head, much like the male Servant that I&#39;d seen earlier. In terms of musculature, both Servants looked rather scrawny, but the female Servant had two things that were rather noticeable. Her tunic stretched over two very large breasts, that on her were an F cup at least, perhaps larger. I gave a low sigh at that. It appeared that Servants physically served more than just lacking muscle, and I privately wondered if their caste was there for certain sexual wants by the castes they served... either that or this Servant simply happened to be that big before her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s going on?&quot; Sartari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much,&quot; Marrh answered, &quot;Mostly some updates on changing Earth toward becoming a new Lycothos and the hunting for those humans in hiding.&quot;<br />
<br />
That raised some of my earlier concerns. I knew that I had been captured at the tail end of the initial invasion, but many of the humans that hadn&#39;t been caught then were now either in hiding or in resistance groups, as Casey&#39;s parents had been. And it had been a raid on their encampment that had brought Casey to the facility. I remembered consoling her over the death of her parents and trying to give her some hope that things would get better. Now, though, I would represent the very group that took her parents from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And much of what they&#39;ve reported seems to be rather noncommittal,&quot; Lesroia commented, &quot;like they don&#39;t know for sure what&#39;s going on but have to report something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re done with your practice rather early tonight,&quot; Marrh than commented, &quot;not feeling up to it... or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just showing it to Harkaal,&quot; Sartari answered and gave a smile, &quot;with luck we&#39;ll have two warhammer wielders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get to swing the hammer?&quot; Eira asked to me as she turned around.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I did get a good look at it,&quot; I answered, &quot;and I look forward to swinging it myself. But first training...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then straightened out and stretched my back pushing my arms back behind me for a moment. &quot;Where&#39;s Lartara?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She went to bed already, and said all of us should try to get some sleep soon,&quot; Eira answered.<br />
<br />
That sounded reasonable, though given what Sartari had said about &quot;newbies being high on energy,&quot; I wondered how well Eira or I would get to sleep. I really didn&#39;t feel to tired and had a fair bit on my mind. Though I only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we do have training tomorrow... not to mention that I&#39;ll need to get my crest and report in as a new Warrior,&quot; I answered, &quot;lots to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then began to head toward the sleeping quarters for us. There had been several beds in there, like there were at least at least fourteen beds there, and with only ten of us, outside of Lartara, I figured there&#39;d have to be a bunk open for me. I figured I&#39;d be able to lay down and put my thoughts together and figure out what questions I&#39;d want to ask Lartara, regarding my remembering my past and how I could convince Amanda and Casey at least that I wasn&#39;t going to hurt them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to bed?&quot; Eira asked after me as I made it to the door, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re tired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tired... just looking to be ready for tomorrow,&quot; I answered as I pulled the door open, &quot;Though if you&#39;d like to talk for a while... I&#39;m more than happy to have your company, sister,&quot;<br />
<br />
Eira hopped out of her seat immediately, raising a chuckle out of the others as she did so and came right over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet they&#39;re having sex before they go to sleep,&quot; Sartari chuckled to Marrh, who only chuckled.<br />
<br />
I ignored the jab. Partially to show that it didn&#39;t bother me, and partially to hide the fact that if it was truly offered, I actually wouldn&#39;t be above going for it. I only entered into the sleeping quarters and let Eira follow in behind me. The room was dark with no lights on and obviously with the sun down, no large amount of exterior light coming in through the windows beyond what was reflected off of the moon. The beds were all well made and made and the only signs of wear and tear being the occasional claw marks on the frame or in some places on the mattress, and I had a good idea on how they got there. I quietly walked to one and sat on it, the mattress and sheets seemed soft and it didn&#39;t grown under the weight of my muscle mass on it. Shortly after I sat down, I felt the mattress compress next to me, and I looked over to see that Eira had sat down next to. I hadn&#39;t fully expected that, but neither did I resist it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not worried about the training are you?&quot; Eira asked me, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do well... big and strong as you are...&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt her run a finger down my bicep and looked over to her. Even in the darkness and even in my more human like form, I could see her fairly easily. She did look fairly concerned, which did remind me of Emily a bit, but her focus seemed to be on my well muscled arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I&#39;m fully confident I can do all the physical work,&quot; I assured her, &quot;it&#39;s actually other things that concern me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... all the mental stuff,&quot; Eira nodded, &quot;Yeah... they got at thirty prisoners who&#39;s names and faces need to matched to their number and their number memorized... the military ranks within the Warrior caste, the political ranks within the Alpha caste, and even Servant ranks within their caste... there&#39;s basic rules and procedure regarding the treatment of prisoners... and all sorts of stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a lot to remember, I&#39;ll bet,&quot; I comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but it isn&#39;t too hard and many of the regulations make sense with regard assuring that ultimately the gift is shared,&quot; Eira answered, &quot;they should know and understand what we are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Lartara was right, earlier,&quot; I spoke up, &quot;we&#39;re to protect them until they make their choice... and honestly would it necessarily be wrong to maybe grant them a place in the cities that remain with the expectation that they accept Lycothan rule...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean not give them the gift?&quot; Eira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if they don&#39;t want it,&quot; I answered, &quot;It&#39;d be a matter of choice... and if they fear us, they won&#39;t want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eira blinked for a moment, and actually looked a little puzzled. I figured she would be a bit puzzled by that. Much of my concern was shaped by the fact that I remembered being Haley and humans I knew as Haley, which included Emily. Eira didn&#39;t remember being Emily and thus didn&#39;t remember knowing Haley as anything other than a prisoner in the facility, until I came in and became Harkaal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s in the rule book,&quot; Eira said after a moment, &quot;you think... befriending them will get them to accept the gift?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; I gave a shrug, &quot;It&#39;s just something that&#39;s been on my mind... especially after Lartara said we don&#39;t want to scare the humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be something to request from the Alphas,&quot; Eira then commented, &quot;they&#39;re the ones who write the policy regarding rules and procedure.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, but Eira wrapped an arm around my back and pulled me to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... it isn&#39;t a bad idea, I suppose,&quot; Eira commented, &quot;the more who accept the gift and the faster everyone will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one way of looking at it,&quot; I gave a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Eira nodded, &quot;but as I said... that&#39;s something to ask of Lartara and the Alphas. Nothing we can do about that right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
That made me sigh and I looked down for a moment. It brought back my personal fears over whether or not Amanda and Casey would fear me now, or if I could manage to control myself so as not to wash out. Eira held me tighter to her as I looked down as she then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;... but I&#39;d think that since you had the idea...&quot; Eira continued, &quot;that you wouldn&#39;t worry to much being too harsh on them. You&#39;ll be able to show them all that this is a gift and that you won&#39;t be harsh to them... and they will see your glorious muscle and realize they want to be like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so, Eira?&quot; I asked her, feeling grateful for the conversation and surprised at where bits and pieces of &quot;Emily&quot; came through, even if Eira didn&#39;t know it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure,&quot; Eira commented to me with a smile, &quot;you&#39;ll do well, Harkaal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Eira,&quot; I said back to her with a smile, as while she may not remember who she was before her transformation, and thus couldn&#39;t share my exact fears, she did provide the right sort of encouragement to deal with it. I&#39;d still want to talk with Lartara, but that could wait. &quot;I&#39;m glad to have you as one of my sisters.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I&#39;m short compared to you and Sartari?&quot; Eira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You towered over me when I was human,&quot; I reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you changed... you grew...&quot; Eira smiled at me and reached out with her other hand and cupped one of my breasts, &quot;and boy did you grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we both grew when we changed,&quot; I commented, my own voice becoming rather husky as I spoke, &quot;we grew and changed until became as glorious as we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eira smiled and looked back to me, &quot;and what shall we do now before going to bed?&quot;</p>
