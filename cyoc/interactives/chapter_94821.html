<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Midway back in the crowd a group of twenty-something young men stood. One stood out- a handsome, rail thin, bearded young man with dark hair who stood about 6&#39;2&quot; . His friends were chattering in low voices with mischievous half drunken grins on their faces. The rest of the crowd still murmuring from the spectacle they had just witnessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;See if you can make skinny Ryan gain some weight!&quot;  one of the shorter friend suddenly exclaimed, throwing his arms up to point to his taller friend in an exaggerated gesture.  The audience turned their attention to Ryan, who, with a grin on his face felt embarrassed. Ryan turned around to his friend and appeared to chastise him for making a scene. <br />
<br />
&quot;So! young man, would you really want to gain weight like your friend says?&quot; Madame Illusia said in a booming voice. <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s head turned back around towards the stage &quot;I uhh...&quot; he said nervously. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve never been able to gain weight&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well just get on up here. I won&#39;t hurt you, and lets see what we can do!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s friends egged him on, and though he seemed anxious at first, they could be seen pushing him forward and laughing. He finally accepted the challenge while his buddies pushed towards the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, is there anyone in the audience who&#39;d like to... lose weight?&quot; Madame Asked.<br />
<br />
There was a pause, and then a moment later a hand was raised. A shorter, very heavyset man in his 40s stepped towards the stage. &quot;I could afford to lose some!&quot; he belted out. <br />
<br />
After the heavier man made his way to the stage, Madame Illusia had the two men stand next to each other on stage. &quot;Let the audience get a good look at ya!&quot; She said. Their vastly different builds and shapes made quite the contrast. Ryan, a mid-20s man who&#39;s long thin arms and neck seemed to exaggerate his height, and Paul, a man around 5&#39;9&quot; who looked practically round standing next to Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, first I&#39;ll need to weigh you. Stephan, bring out the scale!&quot; <br />
<br />
Stephan dutifully brought out a rather large and heavy looking scale. The kind you might see at a sideshow, a platform attached to a stand with a large red arrow beneath the circle of numbers. The numbers were printed so boldly you could read them 20 feet away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Ryan, take your shoes off and step on the scale.&quot; <br />
<br />
The slender, bearded young man stepped on the scale. <br />
<br />
&quot;150 lbs!&quot;  Stephen exclaimed. The crowd could be heard murmuring. <br />
<br />
Paul stepped on the scale next. His sagging gut was apparently through his shirt.  He had prominent hairy moobs lacked any trace of muscle tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;317 lbs!&quot; <br />
<br />
Madame turned back to the crowd with a grin on her face. &quot;Ok, well, now we&#39;ll get ready for a little exchange. Paul, you&#39;d like to lose weight, and Ryan, you&#39;re so thin you need to gain... so what I want you two to do is first take off your shirts&quot; <br />
<br />
The two, glanced at each other with a nervous look and then hesitantly followed her request. Ryan&#39;s surprisingly hairy, but almost emaciated looking frame looked even more extreme next to the fat, bald, round looking man next to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now stand right over there back to back. Make sure you get close to each other&quot; Madame ordered,  &quot;Ok, good. Now I&#39;m going to start this and it&#39;s imperative that you don&#39;t move until it&#39;s over&quot; <br />
<br />
With that the two men, standing back to back on stage, began to feel a strange bond connect them. Madame Illusia waved her arms and began her magic. A colorful mist seemed to surround the two gentlemen. The audience made a faint gasp as the colors seemed to envelope the two. Ryan felt something, buzzingly electric connect his back to Pauls. Like some link that was beginning to transmit. <br />
<br />
Every so slowly the weight between the two men began to shift. Ryan&#39;s incredibly narrow hairy waistline started to ever so subtly widen. His furry, bony chest seemed to get just a little fleshier. His muscle-less narrow arms looked just a little thicker. He could feel it happening. He could feel an energy pouring into him from Paul. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Paul&#39;s massive sagging belly seemed to droop just a little less. His flabby chest seemed to tighten ever so slightly. A small panic erupted in their minds as both grew aware of these changes. It dawned on both of them that this transformation was  really happening.  <br />
<br />
The crowds murmuring grew louder as the changes started to become more apparent.  Ryan&#39;s flat hairy stomach was starting to round out ever so slightly. His fuzzy belly button was growing deeper. His bony ass started to fill out his shorts. Ryan&#39;s legs even started looking meatier. Paul meanwhile was still quite fat, but increasingly less so. Ryan looked down to see something he never anticipated, his hairy chest was thickening and his stomach was growing larger. He felt frozen in place.  His shorts were feeling tighter and tighter. The bond with Paul was keeping him motionless. He could only barely move his head and turn his eyes down at his expanding form. <br />
<br />
After about a minute the changes were quite noticeable. Ryan no longer looked emaciated, but instead was starting to take on an ex-jock look, having never been a jock to begin with, he had inexplicably added muscle to his rapidly fattening frame. His hairy arms, chest and stomach were thickening up. Even his face had started to fill out.<br />
<br />
Paul was looking more fit and more athletic than he had in years. He looked like he had lost 40 or 50 lbs. His gut was smaller and sagged less, his whole body looked less flabby and less unhealthy. <br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s friends couldn&#39;t believe their eyes. Their impossibly skinny friend was rapidly ballooning out. He was already looking heavier than most of them and was still gaining weight fast. His small, hairy stomach was quickly widening and rounding out and looked to be turning into a full fledged gut. His arms and shoulders broadened and thickened. His neck and face continued to fill out to match the rest of his increasingly heavier build.  He could feel the transfer shifting more and more weight onto his frame. Ryan looked down, his eyes glimmered with a panicked look.... he was getting... fat. His shorts felt constricting, impossibly tight. He winced for a moment and then a seam blew out. His shorts were ripping under the pressure of his inflating body. <br />
<br />
As the second minute passed the audiences murmurs had grown into a full fledged din of talking, exclaiming, shouting. Eyes widened as they watched Ryan grow fatter and heavier before their own eyes. Soon Paul&#39;s frame was looking relatively trim. Paul&#39;s pants were sliding off. <br />
<br />
Ryan looked down past his thick beard to see his hairy chest pushing out over the increasingly prominent curve of his rounded, fur covered belly. It now looked like a full beer belly. Round, wide and full and covered in hair. His whole frame had become meaty and massive looking. His size gave him a completely new presence. Like some big-eating overgrown, overweight hairy frat boy. Another audible rip and his shorts tore in the front. <br />
<br />
There were shouts in the audience. &quot;He&#39;s getting too big!&quot; one said &quot;Paul&#39;s so skinny now&quot; someone else muttered.<br />
<br />
Before the hubbub grew, Madam Illusia lowered her arms and the weight transfer began to slow. The colorful haze seemed to fade, but Ryan was still swelling larger. He could feel it almost speed up. His arms, his chest, his stomach, thighs, all experienced new sensations. He felt so heavy. His thighs pressed together, his arms pressed against his sides.<br />
<br />
Paul on the other hand looked trim, light and healthy. His gut had completely disappeared and his skin looked tight on his much more fit frame. The transfer had finished and the two felt relief as the connection that had paralyzed in place dissipated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, just have a look at yourselves!&quot; Madame Illusia yelled out. The two stepped away from each other and turned toward the audience. There were loud gasps. Ryan looked like a massive, impossibly porked-up version of himself. His huge hairy gut sat beneath two meaty pecs and wide shoulders with thick arms. His heavily bearded face had filled out dramatically. He was still quite handsome, now just much, much larger. His huge, meaty body had a strong, sturdy appearance, suggesting that he had gained a significant amount of muscle on his frame. There was something solid and imposing about him now. His much heavier, fatter body did not at all resemble the flabby, soft build Paul had started with. <br />
<br />
Paul looked like the perfect &quot;after&quot; of some weight-loss commercial. His chin looked positively chiseled, with no hints of excess skin or remaining flab. There was no hint as to the enormous weight he had carried only minutes earlier. He wasn&#39;t exactly skinny, but Paul was almost half the size he had been. He looked like a picture of health. Maybe even slightly younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you two, I need you to step on the scale! Paul you first!&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul felt light footed, and walked over with confidence over to the scale with it&#39;s large display. <br />
<br />
&quot;177 lbs!&quot; Stephen exclaimed.  The audience was in shock. Paul too seemed taken aback. He looked wide-eyed at the numbers in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, could you step over to the scale?&quot; Madame Illusia asked. The now large man lumbered over to the scale. He felt his whole body move in a different way. He could feel his massive gut tremble and even his hairy chest jiggled as he walked forward. His footsteps felt heavy, powerful. His whole body felt like a tank, with his new round furry gut taking the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;296 lbs&quot;  Stephen called out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!!&quot; Ryan exclaimed. Other audience members gasped and his buddies, midway back in the crowd, stood slack-jawed. Ryan was now a bear of a man. Like Paul, he was almost unrecognizable. There were so many questions spinning in his head. How, why, what he would do next... <br />
<br />
They stood on stage before the shocked crowd a few moments longer and Madame Illusia turned to them and said in a low voice: &quot;You two, come see me after the show to follow up.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two changed men were escorted off the stage by Stephen. <br />
<br />
Ryan, with a stunned look on his face, hauled his heavy overfed frame back to his buddies, who poked and prodded at his beefy, thick body in disbelief. His buddies couldn&#39;t help but feel that Ryan had developed rather intimidating presence with his new weight. Ryan&#39;s meatier hands explored the new curve of his enormous hairy belly and rounded pecs. Experimentally lifting the mass of his stomach up to feel the weight and heft. Ryan knew was going to have to check in with Madame Illusia after the show was over. But he didn&#39;t know if he was happy or horrified with his new size. All his life he was skinny. Now he couldn&#39;t even fit into the shirt that was baggy on him minutes ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, that was quite...something.. Do we have any other volunteers interested in a transformation?&quot;  Madame said with a mischievous look in her eye.</p>
