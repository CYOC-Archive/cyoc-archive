<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are a twenty-three year old college graduate on a honeymoon with your new wife in a bar in Puerto Rico. <br />
You sigh as you stop paying attention to the LCD television behind the counter. You don’t know whether or not <br />
to trust the media anymore these days; the stories seem to get crazier and crazier. But you aren’t entirely <br />
convinced that the reports of this “bimbocalypse” are without merit. Why would the World Health Organization <br />
even bother with a formal investigation if it was all just the product of rampant fiction from someone who <br />
writes for a porn film company? You sip your cold margarita in the humid air and listen to a steel drum band <br />
play outside. You peer out the window and see a naked woman run by in the corner of your eye. You twist around <br />
to see what’s going on, but it’s too late. All you hear is loud laughing and cheering outside. You turn away. <br />
Finally, your new wife, a beautiful brunette by the name Sarah, emerges from the women’s restroom. Your heart <br />
melts as you watch her push her way through the crowd toward you, wearing a robin-egg-blue bikini. She <br />
clutches at one side of her top, holding it against her skin so it doesn’t fall down.“What’s wrong?” you ask <br />
as she sits down beside you, a disturbed look on her face.“My bikini tore,” she murmurs quietly, facing <br />
away.“Hey, you alright?” you ask, placing a hand on her shoulder. She flinches at first before resting her <br />
hand on top of yours. Something must have scared her.“Yeah, I’m fine, Brad. Some woman… there was this woman <br />
in the bathroom in one of the stalls. I heard her moaning like she was fingering herself… I tried to wash my <br />
hands real quick and get out, but she came out of the stall, wearing men’s swimming trunks, and grabbed me…” <br />
“My god,” you say, hugging Sarah. “Are you sure you’re alright?” “Yeah, I’m fine, it was just really weird,” <br />
Sarah says. “She tried to make out with me. I pushed her away and got out of there as fast as I could.”You <br />
tighten your hug. “Well, you’re fine now. She probably just had a little too much to drink, that’s all.” “I <br />
don’t know… something kind of seemed strange about her. She tore my swimsuit… maybe we should call it a night <br />
and head back to the hotel. And then we can… enjoy our first night as a husband and wife,” Sarah says, smiling <br />
mischievously. You feel your cock begin to harden at the thought of her naked in the hotel room. You flag down <br />
a taxi and begin the drive back to the hotel, a nice tourist-filled place where you feel safe. Neither you nor <br />
Sarah talk, but you begin to notice her stealing short glances at your crotch. You envision her lips sealed <br />
tightly against your dick and begin to grow erect, which seems to captivate Sarah even further.“Mmm…” Sarah <br />
says, taking no effort to hide her lust. “Brad honey… did I ever tell you how big you are? You’re the favorite <br />
guy in the world I’ve ever fucked.”Whoa! Sarah is usually a bit more discreet about her sex life than this. <br />
Still, it is your honeymoon, after all. But a moment later she shifts next to you as far as her seatbelt <br />
allows and begin to stroke your cock in one hand. She lets her ripped top fall off of her, revealing her <br />
luscious breasts. They seem… larger. Or are you just imagining things? Maybe it’s a trick of the light. Either <br />
way, Sarah is topless and people can see her through the windows.“Not now…” You pull her hand away and hand <br />
her top back to her. Her breasts definitely seem larger against the fabric… her erect nipples poke through the <br />
damp material. Sarah pouts, turning to look out the window. But she still steals peaks at you.“How did you <br />
like that beach?” you ask, trying to make friendly conversation.“It was nice. Big… rough… wet… salty… Mmm, so <br />
delicious…” Sarah is staring at your cock again. She’s always been kind of a conservative girl; it took you <br />
two months of dating before your first kiss and a year and a half before you first had sex, and even now she’s <br />
normally a bit reserved about the topic.“You feeling okay?” you ask. “We’ll be back at the hotel real soon, <br />
hon. We’ll have a nice dinner and—”Suddenly, Sarah unbuckles her seatbelt and jumps into your lap despite the <br />
cramped cab. The driver yells something at you in Spanish, but Sarah pays no heed as she seizes your cock and <br />
begins to pulse her own crotch against it, moaning. The pleasure is immense, but you don’t want to be seen <br />
doing this in public. You struggle to push her off of you. Finally, Sarah gives in and sits back in her seat, <br />
topless once more, her breasts heaving up and down as she gasps for breath. She still stares at your cock <br />
through your swimming trunks. You’re fully erect and trying to force it down before you have to exit the <br />
cab.“Sarah? Are you sure you’re okay? Your chest…” “Sorry babe. I just got carried away,” Sarah apologizes. “I <br />
want you so bad. You have no idea. I feel like total slut… I’m sooo fucking horny...”You finally arrive at the <br />
hotel and pay the irritated cab driver, leaving him a hefty tip. You notice Sarah turning to look at other men <br />
as you make your way up to your hotel room—not short glances but long, lusty stares. You have to practically <br />
hold the top to her bikini against her as she doesn’t seem to care about any sense of decency. At last you are <br />
back in your hotel room. As soon as the door is shut, Sarah jumps at you and wrestles you to the bed, tearing <br />
away your swimming trunks. She tries to kiss you, but you hold her just out of range.“Get a hold of yourself!” <br />
you say, pinning her back down on the bed. “Why don’t you take a shower? I’ll call room service. We’ll have a <br />
nice dinner together, and then we can have sex. All right, honey?” “I don’t want to wait,” Sarah pouts. “I <br />
wanna fuck you right now. You wanna fuck me, right babe?” “Shower first,” you demand. Sarah pouts but grabs a <br />
handbag full of soaps and shampoos and vanishes inside the bathroom. You wait until you hear water running <br />
before you start to think things through. She’s never been like this before, and her breasts seem to have gone <br />
up a size or two… Suddenly the news report pops back into your mind. She couldn’t be infected with that “bimbo <br />
virus,” could she? From that woman in the bathroom? The one she claims was wearing swimming trunks? And what <br />
else could possible explain how her breasts seem to have grown? And her sudden change in behavior? On the <br />
other hand, you two haven’t had sex for a month to please her parents. You’ve told them you were both virgins. <br />
Lies, of course. Maybe Sarah has been holding back for so long and just can’t help it now. And besides, what <br />
if she is infected? You aren’t going to abandon her, are you? Or call in a team of doctors and have them probe <br />
her with strange instruments and syringes? Not on your honeymoon night, that would be terrible! You could slip <br />
out and save yourself from your potential fate if she is infected. Or you could take your chances and stay <br />
with her, do the thing a loving husband ought to. Or maybe there’s another option you haven’t thought of yet. <br />
What do you do?</p>
