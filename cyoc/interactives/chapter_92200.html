<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick was terrified. James, no - Jose, had just changed in front of his very eyes and Nick was alone again. Hours beforehand he had been just a carefree surfer in a wonderful relationship with his boyfriend, and now he was a were-bigot. Nick stood there, eyeing the mall around him, looking at the Mexican group that the new Jose had run off with. He tried to be inconspicuous so they didn&#39;t notice him, but he started to stare. Thankfully, they didn&#39;t notice the white surfer boy, there wasn&#39;t much to Nick in the first place to stare at. He was pretty shaken up, and appeared cowardly after recent events. Nick slowly started realizing that he was staring at their bodies. His mouth began to water, as he thought of their hot, muscular builds, and how great their hair looked. Nick started to feel a tenting in his pants, and then it hit him. He was going to change again. He had to stop being horny immediately.<br />
<br />
To not cause a scene, Nick walked out of the clothing store as quickly as he possibly could, walking at a brisk pace to escape the Mexican hotties. He started walking around the main lobby, but he couldn&#39;t get those men out of his mind. Nick was rocking a semi now, and he couldn&#39;t change his train of thought. As he speed walked around the mall, he wasn&#39;t paying much attention and bumped straight into a smartly dressed woman. Nick and the woman both fell over in a heap. A freezing chill went through Nick as he fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
Nick took a second and then got himself up. He heard a shout of &quot;Mother!&quot; as a kid, about 14 or 15, approached them to help the lady up. The woman stood up and brushed the dirt off of her clothing. Nick, kind of zoned out from the fall, stared straight ahead at her. He was completely focused on her boobs. Nick&#39;s thoughts started to go fuzzy as all he could focus on was her big boobs and how he wanted to grab them and play with them. As he stared at the woman, his boner came to full mast, and time came to a halt around him.<br />
<br />
Unable to think straight, Nick started walking to the now frozen woman and grabbed her breasts with both of his hands, feeling the soft boobs with his hands, giving them caresses and squeezes. Suddenly, he was wracked by a painful jolt through his body. A voice rang in his head, &quot;That is not appropriate for public, you&#39;re a professional!&quot;. The voice was deep and masculine and sounded like it belonged to someone much older. Nick obeyed it though, releasing the woman&#39;s boobs immediately. As he did, Nick felt a strange pulling sensation. He shook it off, not noticing he was now looking down at the woman and her son by almost a foot. He had grown in height by several inches, reaching a height of 6&#39;5&quot; now. <br />
<br />
Nick suddenly had a moment of clarity, realizing what was happening. He had to stop! His boner was still at full mast though, and it was controlling his actions. Why was he so turned on by this woman? Wasn&#39;t he gay? The voice suddenly returned in his head. &quot;Homosexuality is a sin. This new generation of teenagers and young adults doesn&#39;t know what they want. They&#39;re ignoring the path of God and they will pay for it in the end.&quot; That sounded right. Nick was never gay, that was wrong. He had always been into women growing up, but never to have sex before marriage. It was important to have a good Christian relationship so Nick could raise a proper family. As Nick&#39;s internal monologue continued and memories flooded into his head, his body aged to reflect his new lifestyle. His build became more lean and he lost much of his muscle definition, but he still looked healthy. His long blond hair once again pulled into his scalp, but not as far this time. It turned to a deep black, forming a natural quiff in the middle. As he approached middle age, the corners began to gray and wrinkles appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
Underneath his clothes, which were stretched to almost their limits, Nick&#39;s body underwent a large amount of manscaping. Grey hairs erupted from his chest, but they quickly retreated back into his skin to the point where they were stubble. The forest of pubic hair that erupted around Nick&#39;s penis retreated back into him and stayed a short and manageable length. After all, Karen liked it more that way. As Nick&#39;s thoughts returned, at limited capacity, he thought of his beautiful wife, Karen. As the man of the family it was his job to provide for her, and keeping his appearance to her liking as an important part of that. She did not like body or facial hair, and Nick respected that. After all, she did provide for the household. In this modern time she did have to work, but part time was sufficient while Nick pulled a full time job as a businessman.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s clothing started to shift, his speedo turning back into two separate pieces of clothing. The top part of his attire began to thicken as it formed two layers. The under layer was thin, and turned white. It became soft on his skin and turned to a bleach white color as buttons formed down the front of it. The outer layer turned gray and became thick, as it turned into a suit jacket, which went over Nick&#39;s button up shirt. A collar formed on the shirt, and a tie wrapped itself around Nicholas&#39; neck. The bottom part of the speedo started to form to layers, but only the bottom layer stretched down his legs. Nick felt a tightening around his waist as the layer underneath became a pair of briefs. The other layer turned into a pair of suit pants, a fat wallet forming in his back pocket with all of his identification and other things in it. Black socks started to form on his feet, and loafers formed on top of those. A wedding ring slipped around his ring finger as a symbol of holy matrimony between him and Karen. Nicholas was a new man.<br />
<br />
Time started to return to its normal pace as Nicholas regained full control of his thoughts. Karen grabbed his hand and he clasped his fingers around hers. &quot;How careless of me to fall!&quot; he laughed, Karen laughing with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dad, that was just silly!&quot; said their son, Mark. Nicholas and Karen had agreed a Biblical name was only proper for their child.<br />
<br />
Nicholas laughed, &quot;Son, we all do silly things sometimes. That&#39;s perfectly fine. Now let&#39;s go back home. We have to eat supper soon, your mother is going to make spaghetti tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark cheered, &quot;My favorite!&quot; and the three left the mall to go to their suburban home.</p>
