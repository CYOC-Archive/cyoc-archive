<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Draco runs out of the restroom and starts looking for his mom and younger sister, as well as the rest of their group. He doesn’t see them right off, but he soon gets a whiff of his mom scent coming from one of the other exhibits. <br />
<br />
This is nice to be able to smell them out, Draco thinks to himself. <br />
<br />
Draco soon runs over to where the whole group was, leaving Jeff behind in the restroom. By the time Jeff gets out of the restroom, Draco was nowhere to be seen. <br />
<br />
Draco catches up to his little sister’s birthday party quickly. “Filling better?” His mother asks him. <br />
<br />
“I think so.” Draco says, not wanting to tell her about what happened in the restroom. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” His mother replies. “If you are feeling good, then try not to mess up your sister’s birthday. If you are not, tell me now so I can have your dad pick you up on his way home from picking up the cake. I don’t want your sister or y’all’s other friends to get bummed out because you are filling sick for trying to wear clothes.” Draco’s mom then pats Draco’s head lovingly. “You don’t have to be just like anyone else. Just be you. We all love you.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks mom.” Draco replies as his sister, Vani, runs up to him, wearing a tiger’s mask. <br />
<br />
“Draco, Lets go to the tigers next!” She squeals in his ears. Draco wrenches a little and his sister lovers her voice, forgetting Draco’s sensitive ears. “Let&#39;s go.” <br />
<br />
“I’m coming.” Draco replies as his sister takes his hand and pulls him along, his tail wagging behind them. <br />
<br />
The rest of Vani’s party went off with no problems. As the last of Draco’s and Vani’s friends leave for the night, their parents tell them that it&#39;s time for bed. Draco’s older brother, Damian, carries a sleepy Vani upstairs to her room as Draco follows behind, turning into his room and closing the door. <br />
<br />
Draco turns on his light and the light to his bathroom before walking back out to the mirror on the back of his closet door. Draco looks himself over again, still wondering how and why he transformed as well as why no one else realized it happened. Draco traced his finger of his right paw from the tip of his head down to his fur to his waist. He stops and holds his finger just above his sheath. <br />
<br />
I wonder if I touch it again if I would make that stuff come out? He wonders to himself. <br />
<br />
Draco was hesitant to do it because first, he didn’t know if that would be seen as normal for him or not, and second, he didn’t want to clean up a mess like what he made before. As he was debating, he hears a voice from his window. <br />
<br />
“Going to play with yourself now?” the voice says. Draco turns and sees Susan, his next-door neighbor. Susan was a year older and just a few inches taller than Draco… well his old human form. She wasn’t at the party today because she was at her sister’s college for an award ceremony. Susan lives with her sister and their older father, who also ended up being Draco’s family doctor. <br />
<br />
“No.” Draco says, quickly moving his hand to his side. Draco liked Susan as a friend, but with how the two houses were set up, their two rooms could look directly into each other. Susan was also athletic enough to jump from her window into his without anyone noticing. She like to bug Draco while he was showering and sometimes joined him against his will, like he was about to do before bed. <br />
<br />
“So, how was the zoo?” Susan asked, walking up and leaning on Draco, pulling him to the ground. <br />
<br />
“It was cool.” Draco says, wondering if he should tell Susan what happened, to him and in the restroom. <br />
<br />
With both kids on the ground, Susan looked up and down Draco. “Your fur is a mess.” Susan says. “You haven’t taken a shower.” <br />
<br />
“Not yet. I was about to when you jumped in.&quot; Draco replies. <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll help you.” Susan says, standing up and pulling Draco with her like a ragdoll. <br />
<br />
As Draco tried to get stable after being pulled up, Susan was already kicking off her shoes. <br />
<br />
“I can do it myself.” Draco says, walking into his bathroom. <br />
<br />
“You always miss the spot right above your tail.” Susan scolds. “Besides, I’m your best friend. Who else will help out one of the only two hybrids out?” <br />
<br />
Two hybrids, Draco thought, there is someone else out there like me? <br />
<br />
“Two?” Draco questions. <br />
<br />
“I said three.” Susan says. “Did you get dirt in your ears too?” She fires back as she takes off the rest of her clothes. <br />
<br />
Three now, Draco thinks, could other people be changing as I did, right now?<br />
<br />
As Draco was thinking, Susan turns on the water in the shower. “Come on, I can do this myself.” Draco protests.<br />
<br />
“Draco?” Draco father calls. “Who are you talking too?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, It’s me Mr. Thompson.” Susan yells back, hurting Draco’s ears. “I’m making sure Draco showers correctly.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, Okay.” Draco father replies back. “Make sure he gets that spot above his tail.” He says before closing the door to the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Great. Draco thinks. Now they got used to it too. <br />
<br />
Susan pulls Draco into the hot shower, which did feel good on his fur. At least until Susan surprises him with large clump of shampoo on his back, making him gasps. “That was cold.” Draco protests. <br />
<br />
“Complain, complain.” Susan says as she rubs the shampoo into Draco’s fur. As she gets all of his back side, including his butt, she forces him to turn around and look at her as she starts on the front of him. <br />
<br />
“I can do this myself.” Draco says, trying to push Susan’s arms away from him. <br />
<br />
“I’m almost done.” She says as gets lower to his waist. As she comes to his sheath, Draco had hoped that she would stop. She didn’t. <br />
Susan starts massaging the shampoo into the fur around his sheath and balls. Draco lets out a low moan as this is happing. The feeling he was getting was similar to when he was in the restroom at the zoo, but not as intense. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you like that now.” Susan teases. “I guess you are growing up.” <br />
<br />
Draco pulls away as he feels his penis start to grow out of his sheath. Not wanting to show Susan, he turns away. Susan starts to pull Draco back around to continue, but she stops when she sees concern on his face. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” She says softly. Draco looks down, and Susan follows his eyes until she sees his penis start to grow upwards. Soon, with the help of the warm water running over it, it was to its four-inch height. “I’m sorry.” Susan says softly as well. “I was only teasing; I didn’t mean too….” <br />
<br />
Draco holds up his hand, making Susan stop mid-sentence. Draco then takes a deep breath and explains what had happened in the restroom at the zoo. As he finishes speaking, his eyes were in tears. Draco turns away, trying to hide his member. <br />
<br />
Susan walks up behind him and wraps her arms around his chest. “Look, I am here for you. But you do need to take care of that. Some of my dad’s books say that it could be unhealthy to not let it out. Look, it’s up to you. We can leave it alone or you can take care of it. I can also do it for you, if you will let me. Just, don’t keep things like this from me. I am your best friend. I know I can be pushy, but…. I care for you, Draco.” Susan says in a soft voice.</p>
