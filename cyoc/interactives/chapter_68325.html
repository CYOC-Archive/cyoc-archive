<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was just getting the hang of his awesome new powers on his first Monday at school following the Sunday <br />
after he had first discovered his Godly powers which allowed him to change just about anything about anyone <br />
any way he wanted just by simply wishing for it! How cool was that? He could make anything happen by making a <br />
simple wish with a thought.<br />
<br />
Ty wandered around the halls of his high school and saw the long row of lockers as he turned the corner. <br />
There, he came upon two of his best friends in school, Grant and Scott. Grant was short and skinny while Scott <br />
was much taller but he was severely overweight. It was funny to see them side-by-side because one was so much <br />
bigger than the other, but the boys were still great friends. Now, Ty was pretty much an average guy, only 5 <br />
ft 6 inches tall and he had an average build, before he made his changes, so he was about in the middle <br />
between the two extremes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you guys want to go to the library?&quot; Scott had asked Ty and Grant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I still need to finish up on a homework assignment!&quot; Grant added.<br />
<br />
Ty grabbed his backpack and walked behind the two other boys when an idea came to him: Since one of his <br />
friends was just way too small and the other was way too big, why not make them the same height as him? Ty was <br />
now 6 feet tall, since he made himself taller and more muscular the previous day, and he wanted to reward his <br />
friends using his cool new powers. <br />
<br />
Ty silently wished for Grant to grow from 5 feet to 6 feet tall, and to gain about a 100 pounds of muscle, so <br />
that would make him about the same height as him. Next, he wished for Scott to lose all his fat and for him to <br />
shrink down from 6 foot 7 inches to 6 foot even, but with 300 pounds of muscle rather than all that fat! That <br />
way, all three boys would look about the same in height and in muscle!<br />
<br />
Just as Ty, Grant and Scott had exited the main building where all the classrooms were and they were heading <br />
out towards the campus library, the changes began to take place. Grant started to become taller and taller <br />
while his muscles began to inflate at the same time. His arms and legs grew longer, making him taller at the <br />
same time. When Grant looked down and began to notice his increased height, he began to feel his muscle <br />
increase in size and weight as well. His pecs pushed outward and his triceps and biceps bulged, while his <br />
calves and quads filled out his jeans. All his clothes began to feel incredibly tight as his muscles came <br />
close to making his shirt sleeves and his jeans rip at the seams!<br />
<br />
For Scott, it was exactly the other way around! The large boy began to shrink in his large clothes as <br />
everything began to shrink! His arms, legs and torso first dwindled by several inches as his fat in his limbs <br />
and torso melted away! When every ounce of fat had disappeared, and Scott was now about 6 feet tall, muscle <br />
began to inflate in all the spots where fat was there before. The big, chubby guy slowly transformed into a <br />
shorter, muscular athlete! Unfortunately, his clothes were still rather big on him, but his muscles made up <br />
the difference!<br />
<br />
&quot;Grant...&quot; Scott said to his friend, as the two were walking towards the library, with Ty still walking behind <br />
them. Of course, Ty had seen them transform all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I'm taller... I feel stronger as well!&quot; Grant responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Scott replied. &quot;I don't know what happened but... I think I've shrunk! All my fat has gone but I <br />
gained all this muscle instead!&quot;<br />
<br />
But boys realized that they were now about the same height. They flexed their arms together, revealing their <br />
huge biceps. Then they just continued walking until they reached the library. Ty just grinned as he saw how <br />
happy Grant and Scott were with their new bodies, and he was already looking forward to changing other guys <br />
using his cool new powers...</p>
