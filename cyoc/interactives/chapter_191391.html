<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay Terry and Melissa Ryann were on their first date at the coffee shop, and Jay honestly saw things going particularly well. He was over the moon in love, and honestly looked forward to the next date. Most guys, especially on the football team, they liked to &quot;play the field&quot; as they called it. Enjoy some premarital, casual sex and not really commit. Maybe Jay was just a different kind of guy, but he didn&#39;t see Melissa that way. He was just eager to find someone he so passionately loved. The first date was something they had felt somewhat shy about engaging in, but Jay felt confident - this was the time for it.<br />
<br />
Jay was dressed in a short sleeved shirt, his letterman jacket zipped up, and a pair of blue jeans, as well as a pair of boots.<br />
<br />
Melissa just felt blown away that Jay Terry, the varsity football player, loved her this passionately. She too had been rather shy about things, despite being by all appearances quite a looker.<br />
<br />
Jay Terry was six foot two inches tall, slightly more lean and thin than the other players due to being runningback, and he had thick, curly golden blond hair, blue eyes, and a very nice tan. His body was not as thick or powerfully muscled as some of the others, but the leaner look gave him a more appealing aesthetic to Melissa. She could point out all the tight, wiry muscles on his body, and it gave him an almost model-like masculine beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have your lattes, one each, and a sandwich.&quot; That was what Jay ordered for them before sitting down with Melissa. He sighed, she was so beautiful. Her long black hair and thin look, creamy colored skin, and light green eyes... ah, it made Jay swoon. He didn&#39;t understand why she was so shy and withdrawn otherwise.<br />
<br />
She was dressed in a black dress and wore red earrings today, and unlike normal, it seemed she put on some make-up and mascara to try and impress him. Honestly, Jay felt flattered he mattered enough that she tried to pretty up for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...what makes the star runningback go out with...well, with me? Instead of, you know, Patty or Beth or Lexy?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, you&#39;re authentic.&quot; Jay said with a smile, &quot;You&#39;re you, you don&#39;t try and be anybody else. You&#39;re exactly who you want to be, and I like that.&quot; He leaned forward, and he and Melissa exchanged a light kiss on the lips, both then blushing a little and looking off. Wondering when the lattes would get there. Indeed, before long a barrista announced that the lattes and sandwiches were done.<br />
<br />
Jay got up and retrieved them, and took up some straws to put in the lattes.<br />
<br />
As he returned to the table and set the lattes down on either side, he started sipping on his while Melissa just swished her straw around. Jay immediately felt impressed by the taste as he drank away at it. Knowing that once she knew it was delicious, Melissa would go for it. Though it seemed she was still just watching him drink the latte. Maybe she was just shy, or maybe she was just liking seeing him drink it. Couples things.<br />
<br />
But as Jay drank his latte, he started to feel somewhat odd. He shifted his leg in place and tried to flex and relieve tension in his leg. Little did he know that his legs were both growing larger, stronger, filling out his jeans more over the course of it as he drank away. Jay gulped as he felt his groin starting to get tighter. He had masturbated just four hours ago, so as to make sure he didn&#39;t end up a horny bastard constantly aiming to get at Melissa&#39;s panties, but it seemed it had not worked wholly.<br />
<br />
He could feel his manhood thickening with arousal. Fuck, but he hoped the girl he loved so much didn&#39;t notice! He didn&#39;t want her thinking he was just like the other guys on the team. He knew they had something of a reputation. Jay Terry barely even recognized that just as well as his manhood was thickening, his ass was growing larger and straining his jeans. Even his calves were starting to feel a bit tighter lower down on his jeans, less comfortable. Did these things shrink in the wash?<br />
<br />
Jay moved a hand as if to check his phone, when in reality he was adjusting his shirt - gulping again as his slowly thickening, strengthening abs started pressing against his shirt more and more. Did everything shrink in the wash? Jay didn&#39;t notice his pecs pushing out more and more, each part growing stronger, larger, more noticeable. Mostly because of his letterman, he didn&#39;t see this, or the fact his abs and obliques were looking increasingly sculpted.<br />
<br />
He bit his lip and adjusted his posture as his back and shoulders began broadening and fighting both his shirt and his letterman for room. He felt mortified when he heard fabric tear a bit under his letterman. Fuck. If she knew I wore a small shirt here, she&#39;d think I was a vain jock! Jay thought with a very brief wince. He didn&#39;t even notice as he tried to focus on his sandwich and such that his biceps and triceps were really feeling pretty tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;Have you been working out more lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not particularly, no.&quot; Jay answered, glad to have something to talk to her about as he felt his shirt under his roomy letterman starting to really strain. He hoped there wouldn&#39;t be any hint of his damaged shirt...or any hint of his ramrod hard cock. &quot;But you know, if you want me to workout more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t ask that...&quot; Melissa demurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s really no trouble. I&#39;ll just have to train legs a lot to make sure I don&#39;t get any slower on the field.&quot; Jay responded in turn, smiling at her. As randy and as weird as everything felt, it was pretty good to know this girl he liked was right here with him. Even if it was pretty risky...<br />
<br />
Ohh fuck, he could feel his nuts bunching up in his boxers!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back, Melissa...&quot; Jay said with a calming smile, &quot;I just need to use the restroom.&quot; With that he got up and started toward the restroom.<br />
<br />
Melissa just watched him go, not even noticing he turned in such a way that she didn&#39;t see the seat of his pants, and wondered if he HAD been working out more. Because as much as she was too embarrassed to point it out, Jay&#39;s ass looked so...so good in his jeans right now. Better even than ever. Melissa decided - when he got back, she&#39;d work up the bravery to tell her jock boyfriend he had a nice ass. Just thinking of it though made her blush.<br />
<br />
She swished around the straw in her latte. She really should get to drinking that...</p>
