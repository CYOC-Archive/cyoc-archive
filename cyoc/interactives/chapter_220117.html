<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vanessa exited the house and made her way to her girlfriend&#39;s car. Nina had a huge grin as she appraised the new tomboy. &quot;Well look at you tiny tits. I think you are even cuter than before. The second X chromosome really suits you more than that old Y.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa smiled as she sat in the passenger seat. The comments about her new found femininity, even if she only had minimum curves, excited her. With her new nickname being tiny tits, her eyes drifted to Nina&#39;s breasts. Her large c-cups nestled in a push-up bra and prominently displayed with her plunging neckline giving more than a generous view of her cleavage. <br />
<br />
The sight had always instilled lust in Vance, and while Vanessa felt the same it also cause a small amount of....jealousy? She was also amazed at her newfound ability to identify the bra as a push up. Probably gained with her ability to apply make-up and put on a bra along with her other feminine attributes. <br />
<br />
Nina also wore a miniskirt and had put in extra effort to give her long raven locks the perfect wavy look. &quot;Well, you look great too Bazongas.&quot; She shot back. Vanessa realized that she had put forth all this effort to show off for her new girlfriend. She felt a little bad that she had decided to dress casually herself. <br />
<br />
Nina leaned in to kiss her, and Vanessa met her lips with her own. After a pleasant good morning kiss, they pulled back. &quot;So, you are enjoying this.&quot; Vanessa observed. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you were into girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina shrugged as she started the car. &quot;I really wasn&#39;t. Honestly, the idea of kissing a girl grossed me out like kissing a dog or Trevor Green.&quot; She cringed at the name of the creepy guy who always starred way too hard at the girls. &quot;However, when I woke up this morning and found out that the men was gone, I was worried about being straight in a world with only women, but then I noticed a little tingle downstairs when I was thinking of the girls. Especially a certain pair of tiny tits.&quot; She glanced at Vanessa and gave her a quick wink.<br />
<br />
Vanessa blushed, feeling a tingle of her own. &quot;Its the same with me. I never wanted to be a girl, but now that I am one I keep thinking how cool and exciting it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So those feelings started after waking up? You sure you just aren&#39;t man enough to admit you always secretly wished to be a girl?&quot; Nina teased. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t man enough to pee standing up this morning.&quot; Vanessa responded. &quot;Seriously though, why is no one panicking? We should get a day off due to shock or something but we are going about it like it&#39;s business as usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel like you need time...&quot; Nina asked slowly, &quot;or do you just not want to go to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t want to go to school. Though I do think it&#39;s strange that it doesn&#39;t seem strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe our bodies remember ot as normal or something.&quot; Nina tried to answer. &quot;I mean, I looked at all of our old text messages. They were changed to be from the new you. Even the pictures you sent. Its how I know that despite the tiny tits, you have a rockin ass hidden in those cargo pants.&quot; A mischievous grin appeared on her face. &quot;I also know you are quite flexible. I can&#39;t pull my legs that high while spread eagle. It was a nice replacement for the dick pic you sent that doesn&#39;t seem to exist anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa couldn&#39;t help but feel embarrassed and proud. &quot;So we have memories of the old world, but everything only shows out new &#39;no boys allowed&#39; world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, kind of feels like we lived a whole new life and then suddenly remembered what the world used to be today for some reason. Why today, and why remember at all? We could have lived our entire lives without knowledge of boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa shrugged this time, even though Nina couldn&#39;t see while she kept her eyes on the road. &quot;I kind of like remembering. Knowing I was a guy makes it more exciting for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina smiled. &quot;Me too.&quot; When they finally got to the school, Nina walked around the car and gave her girlfriend&#39;s ass a quick swot before wrapping her arm around her. That had been something Vance had enjoyed doing and it seemed Nina wanted to give it a try.<br />
<br />
Vanessa also noticed that she was actually shorter than Nina now. Vance had her beat by several inches but she was now half an inch shorter. She hadn&#39;t noticed when they were sitting. It was also possible her new and improved ass made her taller while they were sitting.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the school, Vanessa noticed the hallway with only girls. The girls were all chattering and giggling, and with more then a couple of tomboys like herself cupping their boobs as they laughed, Vanessa could guess the topic of conversation. <br />
<br />
Vanessa noticed that the old gender lines were mostly marked by fashion choices. There were a few exceptions with those who had been Trans before taking on a tomboy or girly fashion depending on how they had identified. Throughout the day it became apparent that no one identified as male anymore. Which weirdly made since now that males didn&#39;t seem to exist. The day was weirdly normal.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Claire surveyed the world she had created. She had thought that being bisexual, she would have missed men more, but like everyone else she couldn&#39;t seem to care. She was just excited about the novelty of the new world.<br />
<br />
There was one aspect she wasn&#39;t completely thrilled with. The unintended side effect of redefining the old gender lines as girly and tomboy, seemed to be that the tomboys didn&#39;t have breasts larger than a B-cup, and the girly girls weren&#39;t smaller than a C. This meant everyone who was female before that wasn&#39;t well endowed got a boost. This was mentioned in some forums and discussions but main stories were focused on the more drastic changes done to the former men.<br />
<br />
Claire never had the largest chest, and she was fine with that. Now, she had more uptop then she really cared to. She did after all consider eliminating women instead. However, there was a simple way to fix this. A quick edit to the book could make changes to the world.<br />
<br />
Writing in the book, she added the following. &quot;The new world has long held technology to trade breast size and curves. It can trade all body types between willing participants and is considered a normal part of switching between tomboy and girly. It is especially common to experiment between these two styles in high-school. It is still socially acceptable for girly-girls to date girly-girls and tomboys to date tomboys if they want. Sometimes a tomboy and girly-girl will switch roles for fun. This new tech is accepted with all the other changes and everyone knows how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire smiled as this took affect. She now just had to go to the mall and trade her new D-cups for her old size of B. Maybe she could even go A.<br />
<br />
Claire remembered her new sister Vanessa. She was in high-school, maybe she would want to try adding a bit more jiggle to her chest. Then again, she could pick up a random girl at the bar and trade with her, which would make her not have to travel back home. What to do?</p>
