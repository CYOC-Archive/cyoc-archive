<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the last drop of the potion went down Will's throat, he stood there at the bedroom door, he felt a weird chill run down his body. He shook his head, grinning, Megan was the hottest girl in the Western Hemisphere, at least to him, he loved it when she did things like this. He stripped down to nothing, standing there naked, the cool breeze from the air conditioning causing his rather large penis to become erect. He thought it would only be fitting to enter the room like this.<br />
<br />
With great anticipation for making love to Megan, he could wait no longer and quickly opened and stepped inside. But to his total surprise, there on the bed where he expected to find his Megan, was James, his long time friend. James was listening to music and reading the newspaper, he hadn't realized Will's entrance just yet.<br />
<br />
Will realized what the note had really meant and quickly turned back towards the door to escape before being seen. But before he could even turn around completely, he saw James look up from his paper and grin. Will turned to wave, grinning sheepishly. &quot;Hey James...well this is awkward.&quot; He said, not bothering to even cover himself, even if he was still erect.<br />
<br />
James shook his head, taking the headphones down and around his neck. &quot;I know you're happy to see me bro, but that's a little excessive, don't ya think?&quot; He said grinning, he didn't really care, they grew up together so nothing bothered them in their relationship anymore. &quot;Well, get your robe on and let's catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will smirked as he grabbed the robe and tied it around himself, he was slightly embarrassed but happy that his friend didn't think twice of it. They walked out into the kitchen where he got them a couple beers as they began to talk. &quot;Well, this is definitely a surprise, a great one I might add.&quot; He said as he took a seat, and drank up his beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Megan's idea, she thought it would be a good surprise for ya. Boy did you look surprised, a shocked look on your face and a woody between your legs. I'm so glad you care!&quot; James said, wiping a fake tear from his eye.<br />
<br />
Will laughed, shaking his head. &quot;Last I heard, you were in Japan, that's a long flight.&quot; Will said as another shudder ran through his body.<br />
<br />
James nodded. &quot;Actually it's not too bad from there to here, but I caught an early flight. Megan picked me up a few hours ago, I've just been catching up with stuff in the room since then. I figured your crazy ass would think a little too kinky with the note. Wow was I right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will grinned, nodding, again he felt the tingling but thought nothing of it, pushing it off as his excitement from thinking of Debbie. After a few moments, he felt like there was little pin needles poking at his skin. He was cold from the openness of the robe and his lack of anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say listen mate, you're lookin baby smooth, what kinda razor do you use?&quot; James asked as he rubbed his friends chin, silky almost.<br />
<br />
&quot;The four blade one or whatever, but I shaved this morning, it should be growin by now.&quot; Will checked his chin, nothin, not even an ounce of stubble. &quot;Going to have to write them a satisfaction letter.&quot; He stood up, his beer in hand and already almost gone. &quot;Come on, lets go outside and get some fresh air, I'm feelin a little outta it tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
James nodded, grabbing them each another beer. They walked out onto the porch, he threw him the beer. &quot;Megan's a wonderful girl, and beautiful to boot, you lucked out mate.&quot; He said winking as he took a swig of his beer.<br />
<br />
Will smirked, gulping the rest of his beer and opening the other one. &quot;That I did, she loves me very much too, I've never met a woman more devoted.&quot; Will arched an eyebrow, noticing his height to his friend's, they'd always been the same height, but now he had a few inches on him. He shrugged it off as the beer talking. He brushed the hair from his eyes, he took a seat and pulled his leg under him, he could feel that his skin was very smooth, hairless even.<br />
<br />
James took a seat, leaning back. &quot;Man it's been a long day. But it feels good to be home again. Speaking of which, Megan said she's going to be staying with her parents tonight so you and I can catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will nodded. &quot;I know what you mean, good to have you back.&quot; He said, making a semi-toast and drinking more of his beer. He adjusted in his seat, feeling that the cushion was expanding underneath him as he sat.<br />
<br />
James looked at his friend, watching him mess with an invisible cushion, he shook his head, smirking. He leaned in closer, noticing something strange, his friend looked very different from earlier. &quot;Will, I didn't know you had cobalt blue eyes...nice.&quot; He noticed that a lot of his features looked softer, his face was rounder, his lips and nose had seemingly changed. His lips were fuller and his nose had started to turn up. Will's shoulders even looked slender and more narrow than before. He shook it off, just like Will, blaming it on the alcohol.<br />
<br />
Will shook his head. &quot;They've always been blue, maybe it's just the light.&quot; He said, clearing his throat as it cracked slightly. He took a drink to help. &quot;But I'm going to need a haircut tomorrow, I can't believe I let it get this long.&quot; He said, brushing it behind his ears.<br />
<br />
After a few more moments of conversation, James had started to notice more changes. Will's chest had begun to expand, pushing the robe outwards, in fact, they'd pushed the material aside, and if he hadn't known any better, he would have thought they were a nice pair of breasts, even with semi-puffy nipples. Of course, that mixed with Will's expanding hips caused the robes' tie to become undone and to hang completely open on Will's now mostly female body, giving James a full view of his friend's changing body. But because Will had crossed his leg, it hid his crotch from view. &quot;Will, are you okay?&quot; He said, feeling a little aroused at the moment.<br />
<br />
Because of the beer, Will wasn't noticing anything at this point, the alcohol was not mixing well with his/her smaller body. &quot;I'm fine.&quot; He said with a little giggle, not even bothering to cover up, he was a man, who cared?<br />
<br />
James had noticed that Will was almost completely now, the girl of his dreams. She was perfect, a nice firm body, soft features, c-cup breasts, perfect ass, shapely hairless legs, and a beautiful face to match the beautiful body. &quot;I think it's time we go inside Will, something weird is happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will shook his head, standing up, letting the robe come completely off now, giving James a full view of his now completely female body. Confirming this was the lack of equipment down below, instead, there was obviously female parts and a runway strip leading to it. Will placed his hands on his hips in that all to feminine way, swaying his hips to one side as he stood there. &quot;Alright, what do you wanna do now.&quot; His voice was sexy and sultry, but it wasn't to Will's doing, he couldn't grasp at the moment that he was now female.<br />
<br />
James shook out bad thought from his mind. &quot;Lets just go inside...I need a cold shower.&quot; His penis was standing at attention and ready for action at this point, but he couldn't do anything to his best friend. He grabbed Will's slender should and led him inside, closing the shades behind him.<br />
<br />
Will grabbed James cock playfully. &quot;Looks like I'm not the only one with wood today.&quot; He said as his slender fingers released his friend's cock, he walked away, swaying with every step, giving James a perfect view of his sweet little ass.<br />
<br />
James struggled to keep himself under control, after all, this was his dream girl and she was smoking hot. He looked on as the brown haired, blue eyed beauty walked, he would jump on that any other time if it wasn't his friend. What should he do?!</p>
