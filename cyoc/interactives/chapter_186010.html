<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Geez, talk about a horrible way to go...&quot; Ian could almost imagine the scene in his head as he heard the sound of what he could only think was a huge bull somewhere around here, jarring him from his morgue contemplation. His eyes widened, sweat dripping on his forehead and a cold sensation took his body. He looked around, remembering that skewered farmer, and knowing that whatever sort of animal was still lurking around must have been the same animal that gored that poor sap. Ian stood as stock still as he possibly could, feeling the ground shift, leaves and branches breaking and cracking under his feet.<br />
<br />
Fuck me, Ian thought to himself, why did I ever come out here? Chaz&#39;s dare was fucking stupid. There was always something sus about this place. Ian was always something of the odd man out of the group he ran with though. His button up white shirt was almost looking painted on with the cold sweat Ian was enduring. His cargo shorts weren&#39;t as badly affected, but Ian was at least grateful he wore something that wouldn&#39;t impair his running.<br />
<br />
Ian was a handsome if nerdy sort of guy. His hair was light brown near blond, and it was styled in a sort of military chic appearance. His black and red elaborate glasses framed his light blue eyes pretty well, and he in fact selected them for the fact the glass really drew out his eyes. He wasn&#39;t exactly as ripped as some of the other guys, like Chaz and Tommy, but he&#39;d been working out as part of their frat for a good long while, giving him a rather lean build rather than the skinny one he came in with.<br />
<br />
The reason he accepted the dare was because he had been told if he went through with the dare, Claire - one of the sexiest women in the sexiest sorority in campus - would go down on him. Just thinking about that had made him agree to this. But now he was greatly regretting thinking with his smaller head rather than his larger one.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Ian was somewhat well aware of the fact that, for all his intelligence, he was every bit as sex hungry as the jocks in his clique. Maybe he picked it up from them.<br />
<br />
So thus, here he was. The nerdiest, scrawniest guy in the entire frat, here reckoning with some feral animal roaming around the place it fucking skewered its owner, looking for another victim. He got ready to move, to run, as soon as he saw anything. Heard anything in there. Fuck Chaz and his fucking dare. He wasn&#39;t gonna go in there and risk life and limb just for a bang. Sure he&#39;d miss out on Claire, but there were so many other babes he could spend a fun night with.<br />
<br />
Yet the longer he waited, and even as the noises seemed to get more animate and terrifying, eventually the noises slowly died down. Ian&#39;s mouth, hanging open outside his awareness, slowly closed and he gulped - feeling his whole body shift with a sense of relief and wonder what would happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck my eternal curiosity,&quot; Ian murmured as he took a step closer.<br />
<br />
He looked where he heard the sound of hooves, biting his lower lip as he hoped he wouldn&#39;t see anything. He thought in the spirit of a horror movie he might see some horrible, huge, baneful bull suddenly wheeling on its feet to charge right through the arrayed tiny and rotten wooden fencing posts to get at him. He thought he&#39;d see some demonic figure with bull like features. He thought so many, many things...but as he looked, he saw nothing.<br />
<br />
Ian breathed, and started to move to leave. He&#39;d seen more than enough on this outing. He had no intention to EVER humor Chaz and his insane dares ever again. This one had made him think he was going to fucking die! But as he turned and started moving, he swore he heard something again. Like a long, harsh wind seeming to swirl around the sides of the barn. &quot;What the fuck...?&quot; Ian kept moving, not wanting to be out here any more.<br />
<br />
This place was definitely too spooky for him. If he could just never come by here again, it&#39;d be vastly---<br />
<br />
Then Ian felt something barrel into him and his heart damn near skipped a beat due to the ferocity of his earlier fear of whatever great bovine horror might be lurking around the corner. He expected to feel his own body perforated, the horrible experience of being wounded in such a way. Thrown to the floor, Ian gasped and felt the breath get knocked out of him. Something had just crashed right into him, but thankfully it didn&#39;t end with him getting a dirt nap like with the farmer over there.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Ian to return to his feet. At least, he only did so when he was sure he didn&#39;t hear the wind howling like that again. He shrugged his shoulders, this was definitely not something he expected today. The wind was not supposed to be moving that fast. Fuck but he needed to get outta here.<br />
<br />
Picking up speed, Ian jogged out of the farm area to head back to college - though he&#39;d have to pass through the forest he went through to get there first. He honestly was of a mind to give Chaz a bit of a talking to. A bit. Ian did not even notice as he once again shrugged his shoulders that they grew slightly larger and more muscular, while imperceptibly the hair on his chest and abdomen grew slightly thicker. <br />
<br />
For there was a spirit here indeed. And it had left its lasting effect on the cocky college boy who had disturbed the quiet and stillness of its empty home. Ian might not know it now, or even today, but he would be becoming quite bullish himself so it might be said. Slowly, but certainly steadily.</p>
