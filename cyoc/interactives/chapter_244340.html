<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He suddenly felt a familiar pressure in his rear, the urge to poop becoming apparent to the little boy. While he did need to go Derek found his control was somewhat developed enough that he could hold it in, though not for long. As for the reason why he didn&#39;t messed himself on the spot was because Derek wanted to savor every second of the monumental build up to his first ever accident as a baby. It was exciting feeling the pressure increase as he continued to stand there and suck his thumb. Eventually it became too much and following his new instincts squatted in place as he began to push. His reward was feeling the head of a solid emerge from between his buttcheeks, spreading them as it came out. Derek moaned behind his thumb as the poo he was making turned out to be a big one. But the best part was the sensation of the massive log colliding with the seat of his pamper, the feeling of it expanding outward. It was almost enough to make him squeal in joy. Another thing that made it perfect was there was minimal squishing of the huge turd which lay nestled in the seat and at the same time wedged between his cheeks. It was incredible! He didn&#39;t even care or feel the slightest shame that he pooped himself in a public place. Actually that made it more awesome going out in the open.<br />
<br />
Finished with his number two Derek stood back up, now noting the added weight in his padding and the obvious bulge. Going back to idly watching the guests his attention was drawn back to his disposable garment when his diaper started to smell. The odor surprisingly didn&#39;t bother Derek that much, unlike the guests who gave the stinky toddler a wide berth when they passed him by, the looks on their faces making him giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun there little guy&quot; a kind voice said.<br />
<br />
Turning around Derek saw a woman (an employee judging by her badge) looking down at him with an amused smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah&quot; he sheepishly answered to the towering pretty lady after pulling his thumb out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though it smells like you could use a diaper change right about now&quot; she pointed out with a grin.<br />
<br />
Getting over his initial embarrassment Derek happily replied, &quot;Uh huh, I made a poopoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then we should go clean you up&quot; she said then without waiting for a response scooped the toddler boy up into her arms. She was careful to hold Derek to avoid squishing his dirty diaper of which he was thankful for. Wrapping his arms around the woman&#39;s neck and leaning in close he allowed himself to be carried to the nearby restroom.<br />
<br />
Once inside he right away saw what set restrooms in this part of the resort apart from the others, that being the many fold down wall changing tables sized for both babies and adults. There even were a few tables set up inside the stalls for those who wanted privacy during changes. Luckily for them they didn&#39;t need one as they were the only occupants at the moment.<br />
<br />
Walking over to one of the tables the woman pulled it down then quickly laid him down on the padded surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh where are my manners, the name&#39;s Karen&quot; the now named Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Derek. Derek Walker&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s a pleasure to change your diaper Derek. Hold on that name sounds familiar, let me just check something real fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling out her phone he swiped and tapped at the screen. &quot;Ah, you&#39;re the guest who was recently made a V.I.P. Also it says this is your first time here.&quot; Pocketing her phone she then gave the toddler a bright smile. &quot;In that case I&#39;ll make sure to do an extra good job changing you&quot; Karen promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay&quot; Derek said a bit nervously, surprised at getting special treatment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax as I&#39;ve done this plenty of times. I&#39;ll have you taken care of in a jiffy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek simply nodded his head, remaining still and letting her do her job. After rolling up the helm of his shirt Karen reached down to undo the tapes on his diaper. Opening it up they were both hit with a fresh wave of stench that she hardly batted an eye at. Pulling the soiled garment out from under him and off to the side, Karen grabbed his ankles and raised his legs up. Meanwhile Derek was blushing profusely at the fact his privates were exposed, his nub of a baby penis on display.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to feel embarrassed sweetie, there&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of&quot; she reassured him before whispering, &quot;And also don&#39;t be afraid to act your age cutie pie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite her encouraging words all Derek could manage was sticking his thumb back in his mouth and sucking on it. At least it kept him calm as Karen cleaned up his diaper area with baby wipes. It was weird but also pleasurable when she wiped his bottom, being very through and getting his butt crack really good. By the time she was applying baby powder to his rear Derek had eased into the whole process and relaxed for real, grinning behind his thumb. His grin widened as he watched Karen drop the used wipes in his old diaper and roll it up into a tight bundle. Tilting his head to the side he saw her drop the loaded diaper in the trash bin which while the lid was briefly open he noticed was full of others of various brands as well as a few pull-ups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay little man what brand do you want?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pampers&quot; he mumbled behind his thumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pampers, got it&quot; Karen replied as she pulled a folded one from one of the wall dispensers, which were fully stocked with the various popular brands like Huggies and Luvs. Unfolding the diaper she quickly slid it under him and taped it on, straightening his shirt afterwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, all done&quot; Karen announced as Derek sat up to inspect her handiwork. After finding the new diaper was snug and secure he swung his legs around to plop his padded bottom on the edge of the table and face the lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;So can I get you anything else Mr. V.I.P.?&quot; Karen teasely asked her young charge.<br />
<br />
Blushing a little and fiddling with his shirt Derek asked, &quot;Can I go around in just my diaper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure can. I honestly think you&#39;re way cuter in just that anyway&quot; Karen admitted as she helped the boy remove his shirt, leaving him in just his pampers.</p>
