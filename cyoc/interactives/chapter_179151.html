<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire read carefully, considering the rules of book and weighed the options in her mind and the options. This was heavy stuff and part of her wondered if it was the right thing. She wondered through her room and lay down on her bed. To her mild surprise she found in her  right arm the blue and white teddy bear Sally. She looked the silly little thing over and thought about it. Her mind raced about possibilities and she came up with one. She mulled things over, wrote a first draft on her computer and then finally committed her idea to the book. Her work completed, she sat by a mirror and closed the book.<br />
<br />
As that happened, she began to change. The first changes were her ears. She watched as they grew and turned fluffy and changed color, lavender on the outside and cream on the inside. To her amazement this actually seemed to be working. Eager to see what else was going on, she took off her sneakers and socks. To her delight instead of her usual boring feet she saw two maroon forms. They looked a bit like socks, and more footie jammies, though they kept her figure. They too were covered in smooth plush fur and had a distinct &quot;sole&quot; on the bottom with a simple paw print in relief. As she looked, she found the seems.<br />
<br />
As she inspected her feet, her hands began to change. First they were overtaken fur, starting on her fingertips and moving up. Soon enough she has what looks like gloves for hands, then her fingers begin to merge together from the base. Soon enough she is left with a pair of mitten like paws. This does make things a bit difficult in undressing, but she persists. Off goes her shirt and her bra. When she&#39;s done, her arms and shoulders are already changed, with things moving down her bare torso. A cream colored patch began to form just below the colorbone and spread down over her chest. She watched as her nipples were subsumed and vanished and her breasts became a pair of sizable and firm but less defined mounds on her chest. <br />
<br />
She took off her shorts and panties as the fur crept over her crotch. She watched in amazement as her lower lips closed and sealed themselves shut, leaving not a trace on her now smooth crotch. She&#39;d wondered about this and the possibility of retaining it, but it just did not feel right to her. A probing paw found the same had happened with anus, as well as a small nub. She turned around to see just above her butt a short tail had grown in. She could wiggle it a bit, but not much. When she turned back everything below her neckline had been changed. It looked a bit like she was wearing a form fitting onesy for a bit, but the final changes were already under way. On the floor her clothes began to disintegrate.<br />
<br />
She felt the maroon fur creep up her neck and over her cheeks. Eventually it stopped, forming a circle around her mouth and nose. Soon that began to change as well. Most of it turned  into cream colored fur, but the bottom of her nose turned into a dark purple and became hard. Soon her face began to shift, most notable in the cream patch which stretched out and extended slightly. Soon she had a short muzzle with a hard plastic nose. She could sill open her mouth and found that she had some simple plastic teeth, though she knew she no longer had a throat. The final change was her eyes, these grew in size transformed into plastic. To her relief her hair remained more or less the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; She said, the sound coming from within her torso and was electronic.<br />
<br />
 She spun about on her new feet and felt herself up and down. She looked a little like she was wearing a high end fursuit or a japanese mascot. But far more animated. Her new body kept her figure pretty well, but was soft and pliable. She knew that if she was cut open, all that would be in her was stuffing and a voicebox. She was sexless, but she was still a girl despite that. For that matter, everyone else would soon be so. Humanity would become a race of living teddy bear women like herself.<br />
<br />
As she made faces in the mirror a pair of blue mitten like hands came from behind Claire and grabbed her by the breasts in a bear hug. It was a strange sensation that was not quite sexual, but good. Teddy bears after all were made to cuddle and she&#39;d made it an important part of Teddy Bear relations. She turned around and saw another beautiful Plush Ursine face with a shaggy mop of dark blue hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Checking yourself out?&quot; Sally said playfully. &quot;Can&#39;t say I blame you.&quot; She kissed the former human on her plastic nose.<br />
<br />
Claire the Bear nuzzled into the shoulder of the love of her life. &quot;What would I do without you?&quot;</p>
