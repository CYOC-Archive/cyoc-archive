<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Candice was enjoying lounging around in their room while her dad took his shower. Noticing his wallet lying out, Candice made a wicked smile. After careful inspection, she thought about stealing from her dad. She quickly shook the thought away, where would she even go with it.<br />
<br />
She threw her dirty clothes on the floor and put on a bathrobe, she figured she would be taking her shower next. It was soft and comfy and warm… just like her dad. She again shook the thought away and looked at her luggage. Clothes and a swimsuit were tucked neatly into its many pockets. Yet she didn’t see any she wanted to wear, not even the underwear. Oh well, she would decide what to wear when she got out.<br />
<br />
Looking at her trophy, she thought about how amazing her competition went. She was so proud to win first place, but this trophy was for her dad. This was something she would let HIM keep, something he could brag to everyone about. Just thinking about him, showing her off, made her feel… surprisingly aroused. Mesmerized by the thought, she didn’t notice Matthew approach her from behind.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey there Dad, didn’t notice you standing there all… sexy” she said awkwardly. Matthew thought she was joking around, and finding it a little flattering, approached his cute and surprisingly alluring daughter.<br />
<br />
Matthew leaned in to kiss her on the cheek only for her to turn to face him at the last second, creating an awkward situation where his lips landed right on hers. He tried to pull away, only for Candace to wrap her arms around his head locking him in. Her tongue snaked past his lips, and to his own surprise, he felt his tongue wrap around hers. It felt wrong to kiss his daughter like that, yet not as bad as he figured it should. In fact, it felt more wrong that he didn’t seem to find it suspicious at all.<br />
<br />
They stayed locked like that for almost a full minute before Candace finally let him go. Only then did Matthew notice himself grabbing her thigh. She smiled down at him, but not because he was getting handsy. Because of the growing erection in his pants. She let her bathrobe droop as she walked away with an ear-to-ear grin and a look of seduction that couldn’t possibly be known by a girl her age.<br />
<br />
As she walked towards the bathroom, she swayed her hips rhythmically with each step. something that would have sent men crawling after her if she were older. But on her petite frame, it looked like a mockery of something she had seen older women do. That didn’t stop Matthew though. His eyes stayed locked on her rear the whole time. Just before walking in, she flashed him a knowing smile, sending his heart through cartwheels.<br />
<br />
Really, he shouldn’t like anything about her, but this place was warping his tastes. Just thinking about Candace’s body in the hot steamy shower sent his mind bustling. He couldn’t help stroking his shaft right there in the open. His very history was changing. Matthew clearly knew he had a taste for older women, but his memories were somehow shifted to staring at young women in the mall, or admiring groups of teenagers in the park, or gawking at Candi’s friends on the swim team. That’s right she was his daughter how could he…<br />
Matthew’s boner was right at the edge, and suddenly every gripe he had was gone. He needed her, now.  <br />
<br />
What he failed to notice was the changes to their belongings. All of Candice’s luggage disappeared. Her swim trophy shrank and deformed, becoming a pair of teeny tiny panties soaked with Candi’s moisture, a fitting trophy. The laundry she left on the floor warped and twisted into the smallest of micro-skirts, and a bra that couldn’t possibly be more than a B-cup. Candice stepped out of the bathroom, wearing nothing at all. Naked as the day she was born. <br />
<br />
“Hi Daddy” She began walking over to him, so ready to take him to heaven, just as surely as she’d drag him to hell. “Don’t be shy now. We still have a whole night ahead of us.”<br />
<br />
Matthew found himself in a strange situation. It’s not easy to find a slut her age. He was lucky to find this little whore in the parking lot of this motel. Picking her up was easy, and throwing her onto the bed was no tall feat either.<br />
<br />
Matthew practically pounced on her. The moisture of her skin from the shower, the tightness of her still virgin pussy, the way she seemed to have years of experience at only 13, it all came together to make her a pedophile’s perverted fantasy. Candi, for her part, lost interest fairly quick. The whole ordeal was just painful, and if she wasn’t getting paid so much, she would never be around a creep like this. Still, Matthew had his night of fun at the expense of his only child.<br />
<br />
When Matthew woke up, he found Kandy still clinging to his side. He quickly grabbed his wallet and pressed a crisp hundred dollars into her cheek to wake her up. For a moment he did hesitate. She sure was cute like this. If only he had a daughter as cute as her. But having children wasn’t for a pedophile like him.<br />
<br />
Kandy woke up right on cue. Seeing his boner right in front of her face. She grinned up at him, “Sorry Daddy, anything else will cost extra” Matthew was getting tired of this girl. Who did she think she was? He considered the option for only a second before deciding it’s time he left this place.<br />
<br />
“Right! Get out!” he yelled, grabbing Kandy by the arm and throwing her out the door to the room. She didn’t even have the chance to put her clothes on. Standing outside stark naked she yelled back, “Wait, gimme my money, jackass!” Matthew threw her bra and short-shorts at her, the money tucked neatly into a pocket. But the panties, those he decided to tuck away for later.<br />
<br />
“Thank you!” she sang, strutting away still in the nude. Matthew rolled his eyes, and gathered his things. Sluts were dime-a-dozen, but sluts as young as her were something he couldn’t let go of. Loading his car, he got ready to leave, but for some reason he kept feeling like he left something behind.<br />
<br />
Getting into another car was a young man, and what looked like some older slut joining him. Yet, he also seemed to be babying her, almost like she was his daughter. Matthew figured she was his kid, and didn’t give it a second thought; he had no interest in having kids for himself.<br />
<br />
Matthew looked at her one final time, at the whore he had spent the night with. Kandy was barely clothed while she flirted with some guy still in his car. As she leaned threw the window, Matthew could clearly see up her micro-skirt, see the young bald pussy he filled the night before. She clearly didn’t mind the theft of her only panties. Staring at Candi’s tight pussy, he was half tempted to call her over for a quick round two in his car. But when he watched the guy drag her in, he figured he was too late. Matthew drove off, starting his long trip home, leaving his daughter behind at the Magic Motel.</p>
