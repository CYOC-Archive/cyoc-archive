<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry had put off this &quot;meeting&quot; with management for as long as he could, and now he was kicking himself for not making better use of the time this latest crisis had bought him. He had strongly considered sharing his findings with that skunk from the FBI, but he most certainly would have the entire park shut down completely, and he was still holding out hope it wouldn&#39;t come to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there Harry.&quot; Was this the same manager he&#39;d met with last time? It was embarrassing how hard a time he had telling &#39;anthro-apes&#39; apart sometimes. &quot;It has been brought to our attention that you&#39;ve hired a private investigator to look into some bookkeeping issues within the company. That&#39;s a bit outside your jurisdiction, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well then. No point in trying to play dumb. &quot;Not when it puts the safety and basic human rights of visitors at risk, no. Within the last week we&#39;ve had four near-fatalities, three clearly the result of someone failing to handle a proper background check, the other from park-goers participating in a clearly dangerous violent activity we were specifically banned from stepping in on. Not to mention countless cases of harassment, and I&#39;m sure the worst of it is still to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the human said, with obvious sarcasm, &quot;we feel that level of dedication is worthy of a promotion. Effective immediately, you are to be transfered to our new offsite research facility. I believe you&#39;ll actually be working with your former superior interestingly enough. I&#39;m sure you two will have plenty to catch up on. And don&#39;t worry, we have a new head of security all set to take things over.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the tone, it was clear this &#39;transfer&#39; wasn&#39;t optional, and at this point Harry didn&#39;t want to even think about what would be in store for him. Obviously the door he&#39;d come through was locked, and he did not recognize these new huskies who were entering from behind the ape...<br />

Cherry laid there, alone with her thoughts as Vinny left to clean up before his next fight, her mind a confused jumble of conflictng goals and emotions. Vinny was going to win and share everything with her. There&#39;d be constant screwing and she&#39;d have so many children with him... but she was supposed to be in charge. She had always decided who would join the order and what they had to do. Everyone else was just some weak beta male who didn&#39;t have the balls to be a real leader like she did... except she didn&#39;t actually have any now... that made her some weak pathetic female that was only good for one thing... but she still felt like herself so she wasn&#39;t really... so...<br />
<br />
She stood up, wandering back towards everyone else, not entirely sure where she was going or why.<br />

Tim thought he really might be falling for Terry. All the rabbit women had their appeal of course. He&#39;d been particularly smitten with Katerina at first for keeping so collected here, but there was something strangely innocent about Terry&#39;s raw animalistic insatiability too. He was catching himself now and then fantasizing about meeting back up with her on the outside. A writer&#39;s life was rather lonely, and she was apparently even a fan. Having someone around the house to keep him company, and help with proofreading... he&#39;d long slipped past the point when his publishers had the courage to push for edits, which no writer really wants. He remembered though, eventually, that Terry on the outside was presumably far far different than the woman he was currently snuggled up against. The only way he could keep this on the outside would be if they stayed a pair of rabbits... which, he realized to his surprise, he was not entirely opposed to. The nervousness wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue. He rarely left his home in the first place. He definitely earned enough to support someone else. Even if he couldn&#39;t, his house was far past roomy enough as it was. He could easily trade down to some cozy little out of the way cottage... Terry stirred in his arms. Of course, it would become so very hard to get any actual writing done.<br />

The exasperated receptionist sighed at Agent Sherman. &quot;I really am sorry about all this sir, but there is no precedent for this sort of accident happening before. The technical staff is telling me they&#39;d actually like to shut this chamber down entirely for a safety check, and suggest you get a complete physical to make sure the foreign objects you brought in and lack of a preceding scan haven&#39;t caused any medical complications. If you&#39;d like, I can try and arrange for one with our medical team, and see about getting our billing department connected with your supervisor to see if some special arrangement can be made here, but otherwise the best I can offer you is a free guest pass if you&#39;d like to tour the park. It&#39;s very relaxing, most people find.&quot;<br />

Naomi and Charlotte were both a bit surprised when they were released from their room and escorted outside, even if it was under armed guard. It would be risky, Naomi thought, but they both had enough training between them that if they could isolate just one guard, he could be disarmed, and from there they&#39;d at least have a chance of making it out of here.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the chance wasn&#39;t coming. Directly outside, with plenty of guards on watch, was an unmarked van that had apparently been converted into some sort of paddy wagon. Still too dangerous to make a break for it, they were loaded inside. As their escort started the engine, he said &quot;This should work out nice for you. From what I hear, the new facility has plenty of space to roam around, and you won&#39;t have to deal with being dogs once you get their either.&quot;</p>
