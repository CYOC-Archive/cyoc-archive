<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">* I, the author, am British so any American readers, keep this in mind. Whenever you see football, think of soccer, whenever you see rugby, think of American football, whenever you see year 7, think of 7th grade and so on. Also, sorry for the many spelling mistakes in the previous chapters because I usually write these stories late at night so I forget to check through for spelling and grammar mistakes.*<br />
<br />
Jonathan entered the P.E. office, still wearing his damp beach shoes. Realising this, he went over to his desk and pulled out his ankle socks and trainers from under the desk and pulled the towel that he used to dry his feet earlier, out of his bag. Jonathan took of his beach shoes and was surprised for a moment because he forgot how big his feet were now. He proceeded to dry his feet and then put on his ankle socks and trainers, once again. <br />
<br />
Jonathan looked at his timetable and saw that next he had to teach football with the year 9s. He sighed as he began to slip on his jacket. Jonathan strolled into the boys changing room and began the register. &quot;Yes Sir&quot; the students replied as they heard their names called out. The changing room was emptier than usual because James group was doing swimming so they went into the changing room next to the swimming pool. <br />
<br />
Jonathan told all the students, except Jamie and Ellis, to go out to the school field the normal way while Jamie and Ellis had to follow him to the supply closet. They needed two bags of footballs and one stack of cones. Jonathan only carried one bag of footballs because he had to open the backdoor to the P.E. office, which is an alternative way to get to the field. Jamie carried the other bag of footballs and Ellis carried the stack of cones. Jamie and Ellis followed closely behind Jonathan as he led them out onto the field to meet the rest of the group, warming up.<br />
<br />
Before the swap, Jonathan was never really into football that much either but now he feels as if he&#39;s played it his whole life. There were 24  students in the group so Jonathan split them up into groups of 8. He did this so each group could have a 4 on 4 match since Jonathan remembers promising this group to do matches this week. As he scratched his beard (he seemed to do that quite often) Jonathan took a football from one of the bags and started showing off some cool and skilful techniques that he wanted everyone to at least attempt.<br />
<br />
All the year 9s ran off and created goals and pitch outlines with the cones and started playing in no time. As Jonathan walked around and observed each group, he could already tell which boys adored football and which ones just didn&#39;t care that much. He continued to walk around to sometimes jump into a game to sort out wether a team scored a goal or not and to make sure that nobody got hurt since football was a very competitive sport. So far, Jonathan thought that Ellis was the best footballer because he was fast, accurate, he passed to his teammates instead of keeping the ball to himself and he tried to use as many of the skills that Jonathan demonstrated as possible.<br />
<br />
The matches continued for the rest of the lesson with the students gradually getting more competative as time went on until Jonathan announced that it was time to pack away the equipment. As Jonathan suspected, the team that had Ellis on their side, won their match but Jonathan wasn&#39;t about to give another congratulations because he had already given one to Jacob last lesson and he doesn&#39;t want to be seen as the big softie teacher. Instead Jonathan decided to consider giving Ellis an achievement certificate.<br />
<br />
Jonathan couldn&#39;t help but chuckle to himself as he watched all year 9s run inside to get changed because they were so excited since it was now time to go home. Jonathan walked back to the P.E. supply closet with Ellis and Jamie behind him again. The two boys put the stuff they were holing into the closet and then swiftly walked through the P.E. office and into the boys changing room. Jonathan then shut the supply closet door behind him as he sat down at his desk and let out a sigh of relief knowing that the school day was finished.<br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden a new memories came to mind and it didn&#39;t belong to the new Jonathan or the old one but instead, they belonged James but they were altered to show Jonathan instead of James. The memory was that he had to stay behind at school for another hour until 4:30 so he can sort out stuff for tommorow. He must have obtained this memory because of him and James swapping jobs because before James always stayed back here for awhile but instead, James was now grabbing his stuff and getting his coat on. &quot;See ya, Jonathan&quot; said James. &quot;Yeah, see ya&quot; replied Joanthan. Then James left and headed for home while Jonathan was stuck at the school for another hour doing extra work.</p>
