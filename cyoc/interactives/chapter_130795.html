<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A strange look crossed dads face and he farted loudly. &quot;I warned you to run!&quot; he chuckled dismissively. The panicked tone was gone and he seemed much like his normal self except his clothes seemed to be fitting a little weirdly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Commere son, lemme give you a hug, its been a long crazy day.&quot; he said with a disarming smile.<br />
<br />
Relieved he was alright you walked over without a second thought wrapping him in an embrace. As you held him it was the strangest sensation, it almost felt as though he shrunk in height and lost weight. As your dad squeezed you back he mumbled, &quot;I can smell that you&#39;re becoming a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed about your BO you apologized, &quot;Sorry, practice was intense and I must not have showered as well as I thought I did.&quot; suddenly feeling awkward in the long embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Son, that&#39;s not what I mean.&quot; dad said sounding downright feminine. &quot;I ... I ...&quot; He seemed to be struggling with it emotionally which confused you, he was always a straightforward man. This must be something important you reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad are you okay?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I think its sexy!&quot; With a sudden blur you were being kissed and your dad was holding the back of your head to keep it engaged in the kiss. with his other hand he was groping at your crotch.<br />
<br />
You tried to jerk your head away but his hand on your head stopped you and his tongue slipped into your mouth and caressed your tongue. You immediately hit him square in the chest and pushed him away feeling boobs.<br />
<br />
Dad was swimming in his clothes and was your height when usually he was a foot taller than you. You knocked the wind out of him with your strike and he looked back at you confusedly. &quot;DAD STOP!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel! I am your mother and I don&#39;t need you yelling throughout the house as I&#39;m about to prepare dinner!&quot; with that she walked past as though everything was normal. <br />
<br />
Stunned, you cautiously followed her into the kitchen, feeling confused, warm, and suddenly ravenous for food. Being a teen boy you are used to needing regular meals but you had just eaten after practice and that was was only half an hour ago.<br />
<br />
As much as you wanted to question and protest you suddenly couldn&#39;t find the energy and on top of that you were really uncomfortable. It felt too hot in here, your throat hurt and your muscles felt tight. You wanted to leave, everything was felt wrong and you were beginning to feel as though you took a double dose of cough medicine, but you didn&#39;t. You would leave if you weren&#39;t hungry enough to eat a buffalo you thought to yourself. <br />
<br />
Your &quot;Mom&quot; had begun cooking up some burgers that your dad prepared this morning, while that was cooking you grabbed a spoon and began eating peanut butter straight, which even struck you as weird.<br />
<br />
Absentmindedly you continue devouring snacks until dinner is served. You find it really difficult to focus for any period of time, you thought something important happened but all you can really think about is how uncomfortable and hungry you currently are. Maybe after dinner you can go hang out with your friends.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later a plate full of food was set in front of you. You looked up and saw a slightly younger... bustier version of the woman your dad became standing there, she had a similar plate of food but with a half burger instead of 3.5 like your plate. You and your dad were going to have two burgers each but despite all you had already eaten, you feared this may not be enough.<br />
<br />
You began tearing into the food as though you hadn&#39;t eaten all day, still feeling weak but thankfully less confused. It was as though your body was using the food to fight the foggy confusion, which sounded crazy even in your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking younger.&quot; you managed to say between bites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you honey, its sweet of you to notice. I am using a new cream and trying to eat more salads.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t mean it as a compliment and knew that no special cream and definitely no salad, touched that body in months. &quot;I&#39;m going to run over to Jared&#39;s after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&quot; sat down next to you as you were beginning to finally feel satisfied with only a bite or two left on your plate. &quot;Oh, sure thing honey, but I was thinking we could get some exercise in before you go.&quot; Her eyes were distant and glassy as though there wasn&#39;t she was running through the motions and didn&#39;t realize what she was doing, her hand slipped down and caressed your inner thigh moving up to your crotch and firmly rubbed your pulsing and now rock hard penis. &quot;Ooh, you like that idea I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; You grunt looking over to the sexy young mom in her early thirties. You stand up, completely taken by your lust and slip your hands under her shirt feeling her firm breasts as you begin french kissing her. Suddenly the fog that was covering your mind lifts and you realize what you are doing and who with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it! You&#39;re my parent and everything about this is wrong!&quot; you yell pushing her away and taking a step back yourself.<br />
<br />
For a second the woman looks hurt by your rejection, but a few seconds later you could see her own fog seemed to clear and it was almost like your dad was holding control for an instant. &quot;You should, leave, you, won&#39;t, be safe here.&quot; You could hear how difficult it was for her to say leave and won&#39;t. Every fiber of her being wanted you to stay.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, you grabbed the last bite of food and ran to the door. Popping burger into your mouth, you grabbed the first coat on the coat rack which happened to be your dad&#39;s police jacket. As you were about to grab your own jacket you heard your mom, &quot;Wait, don&#39;t leave me, I love you!&quot; the tone turned from desperate to lustful in a heartbeat, &quot;... and I want you to rip these clothes off me! I won&#39;t let you go!&quot;</p>
