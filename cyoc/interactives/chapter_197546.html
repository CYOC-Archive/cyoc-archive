<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October was puzzled for a moment, taking a strand of her hair and bringing it down to look at it. Something was off about it. The shade, it wasn’t black.<br />
<br />
It was grey.<br />
<br />
“It’s happening!” She said with almost excitement, more than Chelsea and Yuri usually got to see. Her hair slowly continued to change colour,<br />
“What’s happening?” Yuri asked bluntly, apples still clouding her mind,<br />
“She’s turning into her Grandmother,” Chelsea explained, using her words poorly,<br />
“GREAT grandmother,” October corrected, she took the strand back, looking at it carefully, “hopefully…”<br />
<br />
October grabbed a pile of clothes and began to get changed,<br />
“Whoah,” Chelsea said, trying to shield Kelvin’s eyes despite him being the tallest person in the room,<br />
“What?” October asked sincerely,<br />
“Can you not get naked in front of my boyfriend!?” She said, clearly a little frustrated,<br />
“Boyfriend?” Yuri said, staring at Kelvin. She looked him up and down, “that’s not your boyfriend,” she stated, pointing at the tall, curvy, woman in front of her, “he’s green…” she stated with genuine confusion,<br />
“Ugh!” Chelsea said, crossing her arms and turning away. Kelvin turned to face her, leaning down on his knee to get on her level.<br />
<br />
“Chelsea,” he said, looking her in the eyes, “October seems to know what she’s doing,” he said, “her spell is starting to work, so before too long we should be back to normal!” He said cheerfully, causing Chelsea to push out a little smile,<br />
“Fine,” she said, trying to stay grumpy, but unable to hide her smirk, “and don’t think I like you in this sexy green form,” she stated, “I’m still straight!” She said sternly.<br />
Kelvin was trying to stay optimistic, but that last comment was a little worrying. He wasn’t worrying about not returning to his old body, he had a strange trust in October. The problem was that this body was beginning to feel comfortable.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
October had gotten changed into a set of old robes. They were grey, turning brown as they became something of a dress. They were accompanied with a pair of brown boots and some brown gloves. Around October’s neck was a key.<br />
“That key,” Yuri said, “wasn’t that you grandmother’s?” She asked,<br />
“My Great Grandmother’s, yes,” October stated, “I always adored it, but my father forbid me from wearing it,”<br />
“Why?” Kelvin asked. October shot him an odd look, despite their complete dissimilarity, October felt an odd connection with him,<br />
“I never ask,” she stated, “my father has his secrets and I respect that,” she explained, “I have my own secrets, everyone does. I would never force anyone to tell me anything if it was not my right to know,”<br />
“What counts as ‘something you have the right to know’?” Kelvin questioned,<br />
“Kelvin!” Chelsea said, smacking his arm,<br />
“It’s okay,” October said, “Kelvin,” she started, “I personally don’t have an answer for that,” she stated, plain and simply, “but I can always feel it. I don’t think that’s because I’m a witch,”<br />
“I feel that,” Kelvin said, “I hate when people don’t tell me stuff. My friends do it to me all the time,” she said, almost like he was talking to himself. October noticed something about Kelvin in that moment. His tattoo’s, embedded deep into his skin, they shimmered as he became slightly annoyed. Perhaps he is also capable of connecting with his Predecessor’s power, maybe they’re accessed via emotions.<br />
“October!” Yuri said, pointing at October.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
October looked at her hands, they were much older, wiser. The change was about to truly begin.<br />
“Everyone, please keep a distance from me,” she said, gesturing for everyone to move. They all did.<br />
<br />
October looked at herself in her large mirror, watching as she felt the power heightening. Her face, it was becoming more mature by the second. Her face was ageing rapidly, but it wasn’t her face, it was someone else.<br />
Her body began to change, her height barely changed, maybe an inch or so taller, but the belt around her hair began to tighten. Her robe began to fit much more snugly around her breasts as they developed, as did her hips. Her feet grew into her boots.<br />
Her grey hair was growing longer and longer, cascading down her back and onto her chest. She stared back at the woman in front of her, her eyes were shade of purple. Pure magic coursed throughout her body.<br />
It worked.<br />
<br />
“The Great Sorceress,” Kelvin said suddenly, absorbed by October’s new body,<br />
“What?” Chelsea said, heavily confused,<br />
“It’s her,” Kelvin said, pushing Chelsea to the side, “it really is her,”<br />
“Kelvin,” October said, “do you… recognise this body?” She asked,<br />
“No,” he stated, confusing the group, “I don’t recognise her… but this body does,” he said, unable to take his eyes off of The Great Sorceress. October worked it out,<br />
“Kelvin,” she started, as she usually did, “your mind is blending with that of your body,” she explained,<br />
“WHAT!?” Chelsea yelled, startling everyone, “you have to fix her!” She said, almost terrified, then her eyes went wide, “HIM!” She shouted, “I MEANT HIM!!!” She screamed, falling to her knees, sobbing,<br />
“Chelsea, it’s still me,” Kelvin said, placing his hand on her back to comfort her, “October will return me back to my old form, right?” Kelvin said, looking at October to reassure him.<br />
<br />
October hesitated.<br />
<br />
“Of course!” October said, “once I fix my parents, you and Yuri are next, then I’ll fix Kelvin!” She said, “I…” she hesitated again, “I promise I will do my best!”<br />
Chelsea couldn’t help but be relieved about that answer. She knew October very well, and she wasn’t one to lie. As far as Chelsea knew, October never lied. Not once.<br />
But Kelvin… he felt something. Something was off. He didn’t know October, but he recognised The Great Sorceress. Something about her, his unanswered connection to her.<br />
<br />
She was lying.</p>
