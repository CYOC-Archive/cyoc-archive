<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some thought and consideration, I decided against taking a second break... at least not yet. For those who read my writer&#39;s note from &quot;The Toy Box&quot; let me clarify. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m running out of ideas for the basement arc. Far from it. I actually had a lot planed out for the the basement arc. There are Ideas for the basement arc that I want to write out some day. It&#39;s just that the basement story arc started feeling more like work then something fun to do on my free time. It&#39;s also because the basement storyline gotten so complicated, that even I had a headache keeping track of every moving part. There was so many little details to keep track of, I noticed that other writers had a hard time keeping track of everything too. In other words, that story line became too hard to add on to. It was too complicated for it&#39;s own good... At least from my point of view.<br />
<br />
So I decided to start a fresh new storyline. The story was in the middle of the sky king arc, and then the basement arc interrupted it. The basement arc was starting to feel like filler to the Sky King arc. So this time, I want to try a different storyline. Keep in mind, I haven&#39;t given up on the basement arc.  I will most likely adapt some of it&#39;s concepts and ideas into this storyline. But that is down the road. I (hopefully) learned my lesson.  I had been brainstorming a lot of ideas involving the cloud plane arc for weeks during the time I was focusing on the basement storyline and now it&#39;s time to finally put them to use. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ve been itching to return to the Sky King arc for weeks. This storyline has a lot of ground to cover if it&#39;s to catch up to the anonymous writer who wrote &quot;Getting closer to the Castle&quot;. I learned a lot from the basement storyline and I&#39;m willing to use what I learned to kick this story into high gear! And I hope you&#39;re willing too!<br />
<br />
This chapter is a alternate version of the chapter,&quot;A Punishment and a Test&quot; by me (The 1). In other words, content from that chapter will be featured in this chapter. Things may seem familiar a first, but trust me, a single divergent can change the course of a entire timeline.<br />
<br />
This chapter will also feature ideas and content from the chapters, &quot;The Cloud Crawler Gang&quot; and &quot;Slar the Gun Slinger&quot; also by me (The 1).<br />
<br />
Just in case you haven&#39;t read the other branching chapters, some of the chapters featured in the chapters, &quot;Who Are You?&quot; are written by Dragonman, not Dragoman. For some reason, my mac&#39;s auto correct thinks that Dragoman = Dragoman.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope you enjoy the chapter! I&#39;m excited for this fresh new storyline!<br />
<br />
If you think this is interesting don&#39;t be afraid to add on to this storyline!<br />
<br />
__________________________________<br />
<br />
Isaac woke up with a jolt.<br />
<br />
He was sweating hard. That dream felt so real.<br />
<br />
But just to make sure... &#39;Ilivir? Dark Isaac?&#39; Isaac mentally asked.<br />
<br />
...no response. <br />
<br />
Isaac let out a sigh of relief. Maybe it really was a dream... <br />
<br />
&#39;NOPE!&#39; Dark Isaac shouted in Isaac&#39;s head, giving him a headache in the process.<br />
<br />
&#39;Good morning Isaac.&#39; Ilivir greeted.<br />
<br />
So he really is hearing voices in his head... Having two other people share his halo is going to take some getting used to...<br />
<br />
Isaac thought back to the visions he saw. A couple of them showed that old witch who offered to take his cock away. But why did she need his cock? Then a thought struck him. He recalled that lab filled with disembodied cocks. Did they trespassed on that witch&#39;s mansion? But why would she live here on the cloud plane?! The last he saw of her, she was on the material plane. Does she has the ability to transport to other worlds? That would explain all the stuff from the material plane that he saw in the mansion. But the best he can do for now is speculate. <br />
<br />
As Isaac looked around the front porch, he saw that it stopped raining and it is now morning. Mary was putting away the nap sacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mary.&quot; Isaac greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Isaac. Help me pack up. I don&#39;t want to be around when the owner of this mansion returns.&quot; Mary seems a lot more relaxed this morning. Sleeping really helped.<br />
<br />
Once Isaac finished packing up, he noticed that his oracle hand mirror was missing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Were is the hand mirror!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat borrowed it while you were asleep. She&#39;s out practicing her magic as we speak.&quot; Mary was busy packing up her bag but she spared enough effort to point to the general direction Nat went.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Was all Isaac said before he ran off into the forest looking for Nat.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As Isaac ran in the general direction Mary pointed, he heard familiar voices in his head. &#39;Well would you look at that! That girl had the balls to steal your mirror! You better punish her!&#39; Dark Isaac encouraged.<br />
<br />
&#39;That girl&#39;s magic is no match for my high paladin magic! I will show her what it means to steal from a paladin! Just let me take control of your body.&#39; Ilivir quipped.<br />
<br />
&#39;I have no intentions of punishing her. I would be curious enough to take the mirror if I were in her shoes. So no Ilivir. I&#39;m not going to release control of this body so you can punish her. I need to talk to Nat.&#39; Isaac mentally responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Not if I have a word with her first! Move over Isaac! Time for me to take over!&#39; and with that, Dark Isaac started pushing his will against Isaac&#39;s will.<br />
<br />
As Isaac struggled for control over his body, Ilivir decided to take control as well. &#39;Stand back you feind! Isaac promised me a body first!&#39;<br />
<br />
As the two spirits tried to overpower Isaac, the red gem on Isaac&#39;s Metal Halo glowed a crimson color. &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac and Ilivir was suddenly mentally pushed back by Isaac&#39;s spirit. It&#39;s almost as if the halo powered Isaac&#39;s soul for a breif moment.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac was seething with anger. &#39;Silly paladin! I can use the halo&#39;s power too!&#39;<br />
<br />
And so the red gem glowed a brilliant red light as the two Isaacs had a mental battle inside the Halo. The Halo was providing power to both Isaac and Dark Isaac. However, it became obvious that the Halo was providing Isaac with more power. Dark Isaac was eventually defeated.<br />
<br />
&#39;I give up for now, but I will find a way to take your body one day.&#39; Dark Isaac said. He made no move to attack after that. <br />
<br />
Ilivir trusted Isaac enough to find him a human body so he two stopped attacking too.<br />
<br />
Isaac has no intention of losing control of his body yet. So he kept running through the forest. But Dark Isaac wasn&#39;t done yet.<br />
<br />
&#39;I may not have the power to overtake you yet, but I can at least plant seeds of doubt in your soul.&#39; Dark Isaac seems to lose all animosity. As if he is in thought. &#39;In all honestly, I only know as must as you do. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t figure things out on my own. Let me ask you this. Who does the black and red soul belong to? Does it belong to the possessed armor? And If all the souls you captured are stored in your body, then why am I in your Halo? Or am I? Am I really in your Halo, or just a projection of your soul? Am I&#39;m really a part of Azaviel or is it that a small sliver of every soul you absorb becomes a part of your soul to form me? Or am I solely a part of your soul? I wasn&#39;t shown on the soul mirror so maybe I&#39;m not a separate soul from you. Maybe I&#39;m really just a part of your soul after all. Maybe I&#39;m really just a split personality created by your dark side. I don&#39;t remember or understand my own origin. I was just assuming I was born from Azaviel or the corruption. Who am I? Speaking of which, how did Ilivir&#39;s soul ended up in the red gem on your Halo? As far as you and I can remember, Azaviel never touched the halo so how did Ilivir&#39;s soul get in there? Do you have the ability to let souls into the red gem in your halo? It seems the red gem carries you and Ilivir&#39;s souls. The red gem seems to be the control panel of your body. Are you sure the ring of purity is working as intended? Crawnav of Snowpoint Mountain Village implied that the ring is incomplete. Why didn&#39;t he finished it? Was it dangerous? He also implied that the Deity of Purity is also in the ring of purity. Is it still in the Halo of Purity? Is it in your red gem? If that&#39;s the case, then why hasn&#39;t the Deity of Purity revealed itself to you? You&#39;re both sharing the same vessel. How is the Halo of Purity is intended to work anyways? It seems to be working in unintended ways. It&#39;s as if it&#39;s upgrading itself. Almost like it&#39;s got a mind of it&#39;s own. Does it have a dark side too? Every thing has good and bad. So it&#39;s possible that the Halo has a dark side. And what about the mirror that showed you your souls? Are you sure it was showing you souls? A lot of the things you and I know are assumed, not confirmed.&#39;<br />
<br />
Once Dark Isaac finished his tidal wave of questions, Isaac had time to process them. Dark Isaac had a really good point. A lot of good points. Isaac can&#39;t believe he hadn&#39;t thought of any of them before. But he&#39;s not sure if he can answer all those questions yet. He&#39;s not even sure if Dark Isaac is completely right or telling the truth. He needs time to think about them. <br />
<br />
&#39;Do you have any intention of answering those questions?&#39; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;I am a part of you. If you don&#39;t know the answers to these questions then why should I know them myself? These questions has been plaguing me all day... So I thought I should have them plague you too, brother!&#39; Dark Isaac said cheerily.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t call me brother. &#39; Isaac responded. <br />
<br />
&#39;We are two sides of the same coin!&#39; Dark Isaac responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe we should think of a different name for you. Dark Isaac doesn&#39;t seem fitting for you anymore.&#39; Isaac observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then call me brother! Or keep calling me Dark Isaac. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I still feel every bit of lust you have. Every temptation and dark thought. Each and every urge you have to fuck. I may not understand what I am, but I still feel every bit of your dark side.&quot; Dark Isaac retorted.<br />
<br />
Ilivir was quick to argue with Dark Isaac.<br />
<br />
&#39;You are a disgrace to the paladin name! Die demon!&#39; The two started a fighting in Isaac&#39;s halo.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh please! Don&#39;t you see the irony of what you just said! You&#39;re too cowardly to be a paladin! Being a paladin is not good enough for me. I rather be a dark knight!&quot; Dark Isaac retorted.<br />
<br />
With Dark Isaac and Ilivir temporary busy, Isaac decided to ignore the mental fight to the best of his ability and focus on finding Nat. He had other maters to worry about so he chose to just ignore Dark Isaac and Ilivir for now.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Eventually, he saw Nat crying next to a tree. When he came closer, he saw that she was holding the oracle hand mirror. <br />
<br />
As Isaac stepped closer, Nat saw him coming. &quot;You! You didn&#39;t tell me this thing could show me what could happen!&quot; She accused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t know of it&#39;s power until I found out while I was asleep!&quot; Isaac defended.<br />
<br />
Nat looked skeptical but then she looked defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to know if I would be able to save the town if you didn&#39;t came... And the hand mirror showed just that.&quot; Nat turned to Isaac with tears in her eyes. &quot;If you didn&#39;t came... Me and my entire town would be completely destroyed! Erased from the map! No one survived! I... was electrocuted to death...&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac was shocked by what Nat saw, but he also wasn&#39;t surprised. He remembered the vision were he, Mary and Ilivir went straight into the mountains. Nat was nowhere to be seen in that vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s done is done. No mater what path we take, not everybody is going to be saved. The best we can do is cherish what we do have. It&#39;s a good thing I came. Otherwise, you and Mary wouldn&#39;t be able to evacuate the survivors.&quot; Isaac reassured Nat. <br />
<br />
Come to think about it, if Isaac hadn&#39;t fought Azaviel, then Ilivir wouldn&#39;t have regained his humanity. Sure, he doesn&#39;t have a body anymore but at least he doesn&#39;t have to obey Isaac&#39;s commands anymore. Ilivir was free and Isaac was happy for that.<br />
<br />
Out of pure emotion, Nat passionately hugged Isaac. &quot;Thank you for bringing Marry with you! You saved my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two shared the embrace for only a few more moments.<br />
<br />
As the two let go, Nat regained her composer. &quot;Isaac? Can you keep a secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Isaac asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also took something from the mansion. A pen.&quot; Nat admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pen? Where is it?&quot; Isaac asked. That pen could be a magical item.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in my pocket.&quot; Nat pulled out a normal looking ink pen. Except that it&#39;s obviously from the material plane. It also had the name Excalibur engraved on the side. But Isaac decided not to comment on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it safe.&quot; Isaac said.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded and put it back in her pocket. She then preceded to give back Isaac&#39;s hand mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for taking it without asking.&quot; Nat apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Isaac couldn&#39;t help but smile. Nat is starting to feel like a little sister to him. Maybe it&#39;s because she looks like a little kid? Or maybe despite her being possibly older then Isaac, she still acts like a little girl. That&#39;s not necessary a bad thing. He loved playing with the orphanage kids back home and Isaac can&#39;t help but view Nat as one.<br />
<br />
&#39;When are you going to make her your spawn?&#39; Dark Isaac taunted. <br />
<br />
Isaac chose to ignore him.<br />
<br />
While Isaac was distracted, Nat resumed practicing her magic. Nat decided to shoot some fire balls at some trees in order to vent some emotion.<br />
<br />
The trees evaporated upon impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s impressive. Not the most creative use of magic I seen though.&quot; Isaac observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot; Nat inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean Nathan the human sorcerer could do more then just shoot fireballs at trees. He would explore different methods of using his magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For example.&quot; Isaac touched a tree and started chanting. In a few moments, the cloud tree started steaming. until it burst into flames. &quot;See what I did there? I summoned the fireball inside the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s eyes were wide open with awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you another trick.&quot; Isaac held out a ball of magical light. &quot;This is standard paladin magic.&quot; Isaac explained.<br />
<br />
Nat was about to burst with excitement. But then she had a thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Isaac? Can I ask you something?&quot; Nat asked shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you train me to be a Paladin and teach me all the magic you know? Without the human Nathan, I&#39;ll need another teacher to substitute for him. You&#39;re the second best person to be my teacher. Can you also train me in using a sword too? I understand I can&#39;t rely on my magic for everything.&quot; Nat explained.<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t be any more happy. &quot;I&#39;ll be glad to.&quot; Isaac accepted. <br />
<br />
Nat jumped for joy. &quot;Yipee!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I hate kids.&#39; Ilivir commented.<br />
<br />
Isaac doesn&#39;t agree at all. He loves kids. And making Nat happy fills a warm place in his heart.<br />
<br />
*rustle*<br />
<br />
That&#39;s strange. For the last few minutes, Isaac has been hearing the sounds of twigs breaking, cloud leaves and grass rustling and trees evaporating under the intense heat of Nat&#39;s fire magic.<br />
<br />
But besides from Nat, Isaac has&#39;t seen the sources of the other noises. Even in the cloud plane, he should have seen a least one cloud animal rustling about.... unless....<br />
<br />
As if right on cue, a group of cloud men armed with air razors (cloud guns) and cloud blades silently came out from behind the bushes and trees and surrounded the two heroes.<br />
<br />
Idiot! Even in a different plane of existence, Bandit Tactics 101 still applies: A bunch of thugs hide behind a bunch of common objects and wait to ambush the poor sap. But to give these guy&#39;s credit, they did a good job avoiding being seen. Otherwise, Isaac would have seen this tired trick from the book from a mile away. These guys knew what they were doing to elude Isaac until it was too late. Though one has to question why Nat hadn&#39;t hit one of the bandits hiding behind the trees during her practice session.<br />
<br />
Things escalated quickly when one of the men grabbed Nat from behind and held a cloud gun to her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are the Cloud Crawlers!  Strip naked and toss your weapons and belongings aside if you know what&#39;s good for your friend!&quot; The thug demanded.<br />
<br />
Nat noticeably paled when she heard the bandit gang&#39;s name. This &quot;Cloud Crawlers&quot; must be notorious in this world.<br />
<br />
Isaac gritted his teeth in frustration. If this guy knows what he&#39;s doing, then he won&#39;t hesitate to end Nat&#39;s life in a split second.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Isaac tossed his oracle hand mirror aside. He also willed his reshapable dark armor to slide off of him like liquid metal. As the liquid form of the armor hit the ground, it reshaped itself into a solid metal sphere. <br />
<br />
That was the only form of &quot;belongings&quot; Isaac had. Without his armor, the whole world was able to see his chimeric body, his twin demon cocks and Azaviel&#39;s air dragon spawn.<br />
<br />
The bandits were awestruck. They were expecting to laugh at their victim and take his belongings, but they couldn&#39;t help but feel... aroused by the strange creature&#39;s majestic cocks.<br />
<br />
Nat in turn wanted to puke. Normally, cloud people shouldn&#39;t feel disgust for sexual organs until they reach maturity. But Nat is... a exception. She&#39;s two years older then Mary, yet her sexual organs still has yet to appear. The only thing she developed during her estimated maturity period was a deep disgust for sex. The town nurse said that she is a late bloomer and that they will appear eventually. And to be honest, she&#39;s kind of grateful that she hasn&#39;t matured yet. Otherwise, the king&#39;s men would have a reason to carry her to the king&#39;s castle. The downside is that she looks like a kid despite being taller then most cloud people. One of the reason&#39;s she became the town librarian is to make people stop mistaking her as a kid. Besides, she gets to read some library books on her free time. That was her life until the human Nathan arrived...<br />
<br />
Either way, it&#39;s disgusting to have a strange purple air dragon leach off of Isaac&#39;s... naughty bits. Does he have no dignity? Were did he find a bady air dragon anyways? Unforuantly, she can&#39;t turn away from Isaac&#39;s cocks with a cloud gun to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve discarded my belongings. Let her go.&quot; Isaac said sternly.<br />
<br />
The thug snickered. &quot;I didn&#39;t say anything about letting her go. Men! Kill this monster! It&#39;s this lady&#39;s turn to relive herself of her belongings.&quot; The cloud man has a perverse smirk on his face. &quot;I&#39;ll do the honor&#39;s of &quot;reliving her&quot;.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nat was tearing up. &quot;Don&#39;t kill him!&quot; Nat desperately shouted.<br />
<br />
The bandit holding Nat hostage smiled at Isaac. &quot;Don&#39;t try to fight back. Otherwise, I&#39;ll kill her on the spot. We don&#39;t need either of you to be alive to rob your corpses. So if you want this girl to live, then I suggest you let my men kill you.&quot; He taunted spitefully.<br />
<br />
Isaac could only watch helplessly as the bandit started striping down Nat bit by bit. The entire time, he held his air razor (gun) against a vital organ. <br />
<br />
As Isaac watched Nat getting unwillingly striped down in front of him, the other bandits were hard at work shooting and slashing at Isaac&#39;s body. Granite and plant fibers were flying. But Isaac didn&#39;t move. He just stood there and watched as Nat get striped down.<br />
<br />
Damn it!!!! So as long that thug has his finger on the trigger, there was nothing Isaac can do without tempting the thug to just kill Nat. Isaac considered his options. He left his make-shift sword back at the town ruins. Without his armor, he can&#39;t form a new enchanted metal sword from it&#39; metal. He can spawn a sword from his body, but that will take a lot longer then spawning a sword from his metal armor. A few painful moments a that. Luckily, it seems the bandits hasn&#39;t notice the metal halo floating above them. Perhaps Isaac could use it as a weapon. Perhaps he can use it to disarm the thug holding Nat hostage! But he must be careful as to not let the floating metal halo from being seen. Isaac could also assimilate the bandits on the spot. The problem is the they&#39;re still people. Even if they are scum. Though if he did adsorbed them his body will get lighter... But if he&#39;s going to adsorb them, then he must do it quickly. Making the attempt might get Nat killed. There&#39;s also the chance that Nat might get adsorbed by accident. The metal ball form of his armor is beyond the circle of bandits surrounding Isaac. If he could just reach his armor, he could turn the tides by punching them with his spiked gauntlets...  Yet, his corrupt body is a weapon too...<br />
<br />
Isaac can fight back, but that will be risking Nat&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&#39;Let me take the wheel! Why fight them when we can just &quot;dominate&quot; them?&#39; Dark Isaac suggested.<br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s tempted...but he&#39;s not sure what Azaviel&#39;s corrupt cum would do to the cloud men. He doesn&#39;t want to turn them into monsters or take away their freedom.<br />
<br />
&#39;You need to find Nat quickly? Then let me take control. My fighting style is more aggressive and nimble then both of you.&#39; Ilivir suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&#39; Dark Isaac exclaimed. He&#39;s insulted that this buffoon would even consider himself as a better fighter them him!<br />
<br />
But Isaac took Ilivir&#39;s words seriously. Ilivir isn&#39;t his usual arrogant self. He&#39;s cold and calculating right now. Just like when Ilivir fought and defeated Dark Isaac for the first time. He seems to be in battle mode now. He also seems to know what he&#39;s saying, and Isaac is inclined to trust him.<br />
<br />
What should he do? Isaac should be able to fight back without assistance. Sure, they may be armed with swords and guns, but Isaac&#39;s body should be tough enough to handle their weapons just fine.<br />
<br />
Every second he wastes is a second closer to Nat getting raped. He&#39;s got to act now!<br />
<br />
But what can he do? While Nat is held hostage, Isaac can&#39;t fight back.<br />
<br />
&#39;Just let her die. You have some cloud bastards to adsorb.&#39; Dark Isaac encouraged.<br />
<br />
&#39;I-I can&#39;t.&#39; Isaac weakly responded.<br />
<br />
Nat could only helplessly watch Isaac let his body get dismantled. Already, one of his arms has fallen off. And to make maters worse, some pervert is striping off her clothes. What will happen when he finds out she has no sexual organs yet? Will he kill her?<br />
<br />
Unnoticed by everyone, a faint blue glow was coming from Nat&#39;s pocket...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s the last of it!&#39; Mary thought. She just finished packing.<br />
<br />
But before she could step off the front porch, she felt something cold press against her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t move unless you want a bunch of holes in your back.&quot; The stranger said.<br />
<br />
The unknown man had the insight to slide Mary&#39;s royal fencing sword out of it&#39;s holder.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence as the mysterious man examined Mary&#39;s sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my. So you are more then just a damsel in distress.  Is this a royal fencing sword? It take it you have connections with the king? Interesting.&quot; He tossed the sword a few feet away. &quot;You won&#39;t be needing that sword. Wouldn&#39;t want you to get rebellious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary could feel the man&#39;s breath against the back of her neck. &quot;You&#39;re going to be my tour guild. Be a dear and show me all your mansion&#39;s valuables.&quot; The stranger commanded.<br />
<br />
Mary bravely corrected the man,  &quot;You&#39;re sadly mistaken. I&#39;m just passing through. I never been inside the mansion much less lived there.&quot; Mary corrected.<br />
<br />
Mary was half expecting the man to kill her in anger... but instead, there was just silence. It seems that he&#39;s actually considering her words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you don&#39;t live here, a hostage is still a hostage. I doubt that the owner of this place would bare the thought of having your mist (blood) on their hands. Now move.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mystery man maneuvered Mary up to the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t even think about fighting back swordswoman. In case you haven&#39;t realized, you have a mist scatterer (shot gun) to your back. This particular variety is from the material plane. Got it from an lucky raid. It shoots solid bullets that can slice through clouds. And my aim and reflexes are really good. I&#39;m actually a really good sniper with this thing. So if I could easily hit my target from a distance, imagine what would happen if I shot you at point blank range.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marry couldn&#39;t help but sweat a little.<br />
<br />
But she&#39;s not that delicate. This man seems to be a little flexible. Just how much information can she get from him?<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask who you are at least?&quot; Marry asked. That one question might end her life...<br />
<br />
But if seems her risk payed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha ha ha. I wouldn&#39;t be asking that question if I were in your situation. But to humor you, I am Slar, the legendary mercenary of the Cloud Crawler Gang.&quot; Slar answered.<br />
<br />
Slar? Mary heard of him. Apparently, he&#39;s one of the Cloud Crawler&#39;s elite.<br />
<br />
The Cloud Crawler Gang is a independent group of bandits. Mary heard that they were made up of cloud people of all types. Thugs, professional mercenaries, assassins, ninjas, nurses, real bandits, merchants, scientists, magic users, ect. They are the closest to what the cloud kingdom has to a organized rebellion group. But that&#39;s only because they don&#39;t obey the king and are willing to defend themselves if the king&#39;s men were ever to attack any member of the gang. They are a huge and powerful group who are independent from the king. But they don&#39;t fight for the people. They fight for themselves.<br />
<br />
But why would the Cloud Crawler Gang send one of their top mercenaries to this place? Is it because of the possible treasures in such a rich looking mansion? Or is there something specific that they are looking for?<br />
<br />
But Mary didn&#39;t have anymore room to ask questions. With a nudge from Slar&#39;s metal shot gun, she reluctantly opened and entered the front door of the mansion with Slar following suit.</p>
