<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I’m keeping pronoun usage to what the character prefers, so even being in a female body, Curtis will always use he/him.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curtis walked to the next door house where the Hernandez family lived. Curtis couldn’t help but be curious as to what the family looked like in this world - normally, there was the man & wife, and their two kids, Fernando who was 13 and Maria, who was 9. He approached the door and took a deep breath. He felt nervous, and thought that maybe because this body didn’t have the testosterone he was used to, some of his usual self-assured feelings went too. He knocked on the door and waited patiently. <br />
A moment passed and the door opened. On the other side, Curtis saw a female black teenager, who had her hair dyed red on one side, and all of it pulled back into a ponytail that looked outwards. Curtis looked at her left hand to find a name, and he did: ‘Fernando Hernandez’. Fernando rolled his eyes and turned around before shouting, “Mom, the neighbor is here for the trade!” Moments later, he heard loud footsteps make their way to the door. <br />
From behind Fernando appeared a tall, large man, Curtis assumed to me Mrs. Hernandez. She stepped out onto toe porch, unveiling the body in its entirety. She stood no shorter than 7’ tall, with long thick blonde hair pulled back into a bun. She had a big bushy blonde beard, but you could tell there was a square jaw underneath. She wore a blue tank top which put the thick bodybuilder-like muscles her body had on display. Mrs. Hernandez also wore a pair of grey sweatpants, through which you could see that she was going commando, and the sweatpants wrapped around the at least 12 inch soft cock between her legs. You could tell she had thick muscular legs as well. On her large feet were a pair of sandals which looked to be at least size 20. <br />
“Thank you for agreeing to trade, Curtis.” Mrs. Hernandez spoke, in a deep bass voice with a Spanish accent. “I tired of being so… muscle guy. And you bring such sweet girl for me!” She looked excited and held out her left hand, like for a handshake. Curtis nodded and used her left hand to shake, and for a moment, his vision blurred.<br />
Now. instead of looking up at the big man in front of him, he looked down to see the woman he was just a second ago. He looked at his left hand, and saw the tattoo there changed to his own name.<br />
Mrs. Hernandez turned to walk inside, not skipping a beat. “Have good day at work! Don’t forget we have party for neighbors tonight and you both invited!” Curtis nodded. “Yeah, we’ll be there…” He felt his body rumble as he spoke, the bass causing vibrations. He walked back to his house to get dressed for work, deciding he couldn’t go to work dressed like he just walked out of a gym.<br />
As he walked into the bedroom, he walked past Jennifer, who didn’t seem the least bit alarmed to see a complete stranger walk into their home. Once he got to the bedroom, Curtis stripped naked to see what he was working with. He was clean shaven below the neck, meaning his muscles were prominently on display. His arms were the size of basketballs when he flexed, and each of his pecs were bigger than his head. On his left pec was a tattoo of some kind of Scandinavian rune. His stomach was tight against the muscle underneath, and he could see every muscle in great detail. He counted his abs, he had a 10-pack! His package was no less impressive, his dick swinging freely above a set of balls which were no smaller than tennis balls each. His legs looked like giant tree trunks.<br />
Curtis started looking for clothes that would fit his new body. He found mens clothes were on the left side of the closet, and seemed to grow in size the further he went back. He reached for the very back of the closet to find a blue polo that, while still a bit tight around his chest, fit him well. Underwear was difficult, however, he couldn’t find anything that could contain his monster cock.<br />
As he struggled, Curtis found himself getting frustrated, not with his inability to find underwear, but with himself for wanting to put any on in the first place. “Why should I want to hide this monster? Any real man would be proud of this beast!” He thought to himself. He figured the testosterone of his current body was catching up with him, and he decided to forgo underwear. He found a pair of black dress pants that he put on, making sure the outline of his dick was on display. He then found a pair of matching dress shoes, and confidently strode out to greet his girlfriend with his newfound masculine confidence.<br />
Jennifer was sitting on the couch waiting for Curtis, reading a book in the meantime. She had gotten dressed in a speedo and a T-Shirt, dressed to head to her job as a swim instructor.  Curtis approached, becoming horny as he practically pushed his dick in his girlfriends face. “O-Oh wow, you really are huge everywhere.” Curtis, thinking with his dick, asked, “Wanna suck it?” <br />
“I’m sorry, this body only likes female bodies… Im just not into it right now. I can make a trade at work if you want? Do you prefer males or females right now?”  Curtis grunted, not caring. “Alright, I’ll find something. I’ll see you later, okay?” She stood up and kissed Curtis, who responded in return. The two of them then went to their respective jobs.</p>
