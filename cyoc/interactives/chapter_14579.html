<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Renee Andrews was a 22 year old film student at NYSU, in need of a groundbreaking film for her final year. The class had been given three months to plan out a movie, a minimum of one hour long. Sadly, she'd been short on ideas and initiative, and found herself unable to come up with an original idea for a movie.<br />
<br />
                Fearing the worst, she'd decided she would do a documentary rather than fail the class. But after a week, she'd found nothing interesting enough to make an even passable documentary about.<br />
<br />
                Surfing the internet, she'd stumbled on an idea: she would document a bit of folklore from upstate New York.  It would be cheap, as she wasn't even a two hour drive away from the area she'd be covering, and she doubted that her movie would be anything like what her classmates were doing.<br />
<br />
                The only problem was finding a suitably interesting legend. She scoured the web for two days, worrying that she'd have to go to New Jersey to do a fairly lame retelling of the Jersey Devil legend, but then she stumbled on something even weirder. <br />
<br />
<br />
                A small community near the finger lakes region named &quot;La Morte Petit&quot;-French for &quot;The Little Death&quot; was odd enough, but the legend it had attached to itself was even odder.  <br />
<br />
                Apparently, in the early 1900's, there had been a rash of murders and kidnappings. Seven young men had died, and seven young women had disappeared. Though they found the bodies of the men, horrifically mutilated (and with evidence of cannibalism, no less!), no trace of the women had ever turned up.<br />
<br />
                It was said that they were taken by a &quot;wild woman&quot; or &quot;demon woman&quot; who lived in the thick woods to the north of the community, and she was rumored to still haunt the area.<br />
<br />
              Since 1950, 40 people had either been reported missing, or found dead in the area. All of them were under thirty. Renee knew she'd found what she was looking for, but couldn't shake the feeling she shouldn't go. <br />
<br />
              Obviously, it couldn't be the same person still killing, could it? She struggled with herself for a day or so on the project, not sure she could go forward with it. Her fears and her ambition were at odds, to be sure, but finally, she forced herself to commit, making reservations at a Motel 6 about 10 miles from La Morte Petite.<br />
<br />
<br />
              She managed to coerce a trio of friends to go along with her, teasing them with the idea of becoming movie stars. (Very tongue-in-cheek, mind you.) <br />
<br />
               Her closest female friend, Jenny Smith would be getting much of the face time on the camera, particularly for interview scenes with locals. Jenny was a long-legged blonde with a large chest and bright blue eyes, and had hair that hung down to her ass. She had a stripper's body, which was appropriate, as she stripped to pay her way through college.<br />
<br />
               Matt Howe was another friend she'd made in college, though he was two years her senior. He'd already made junior partner at the stock brokerage he worked for, but always had time for Renee. He was a moderately built man, with a dark complexion and a perpetual five o'clock shadow. He had deep brown eyes, and hair that hung just above his shoulders, rather unkempt and straggly. Renee had a feeling that Matt was attracted to her, but he'd never said anything directly to her.<br />
<br />
              Her final companion was her friend Rowan. Originally, she hadn't planned on even asking her to come along, but Rowan insisted on accompanying her. Rowan was a pagan priestess, and she actually owned a small coffee shop in downtown New York. Rowan was a bit older, approximately thirty. She had a slightly rounded figure, and dishwater blonde hair that seemed to be the texture of straw. Rowan's main concern was for Renee's safety, as well as the others who  would be joining her.<br />
<br />
              Renee herself had a finely toned body and fairly large breasts for her frame. She stood roughly 5'5&quot;.  Her hair was cut rather short, hanging barely below her ears, and she had deep blue eyes. Though she longed for someone to tell her how pretty her eyes were, Renee had found long ago that the men obsessed about one of two things: either her chest or her full and pouty lips.<br />
<br />
               Her normally cheerful smile was gone this morning-for it was time for the team to leave, and spend the week researching the legend. Though she knew it was a legend, she couldn't shake the forboding feeling in the pit of her stomach, and Rowan's reaction hadn't helped matters any.<br />
<br />
              Forcing herself to go, Renee exited her dorm, heading to the common area to meet the rest of her crew. Perhaps it was out of paranoia, but she left a note on her bed, with her hotel address and instructions to call the police if she didn't return within a week.<br />
<br />
             With a certain finality, she descended the stairs, heading for the common, wondering if she'd ever return.</p>
