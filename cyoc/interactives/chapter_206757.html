<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Be careful with that stuff!&quot; Riley told Kit. &quot;It has some kind of weird magic that can transform people. In fact, I&#39;m really 11 years old, but when I put this speedo on I bloated up until I took this form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Really? So, you&#39;re not a 30 year old dude but a kid instead. Huh?&quot; Kit raised an eyebrow in concern for an instant before he burst out laughing. &quot;Hahaha, nice one, pal. I&#39;ve heard tons of silly stories from my fans, but yours surpasses them. Hahahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not joking!&quot; Riley replied while his face reddened in shame and anger. &quot;Why would I tell you something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe you just want to get my attention or make fun of me, so you can tell your friends.&quot; Kit shrugged before he took his phone and typed something on it. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, but if you can&#39;t help me I guess I&#39;m going outside to explore for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kit turned around Riley and went inside the elevator, but before he could press a button, Riley stopped him and teller him he want to be with him if that&#39;s possible. Riley didn&#39;t want his idol to be turned into a hairy fat man like him, and if Kit didn&#39;t want to believe him, at least he could be close to prevent he uses the speedo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jokes apart. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ll join me.&quot; Kit told Riley while they stayed in the elevator. &quot;A big guy like you should know a lot good places around here. I&#39;m bi, so you can imagine that I&#39;m open for any good experience, you know. Maybe some action at beach or in a club, if you&#39;re gay or bi, I can even give you an opportunity!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kit winked and smiled at Riley who blushed once again, he didn&#39;t know that his idol was bi. He had never considered Kit&#39;s sexual preferences in first place. He only enjoyed his family friendly streams where he played some of Riley&#39;s favorite games. But now that he knew this new information and with the body of a man way beyond puberty, Riley was starting to get some different feeling towards Kit.<br />
<br />
While he was thinking about that, the elevator&#39;s gates opened and Kit immediately came out and invited Riley to follow him. They walked through the beach for a while until they found a nice spot under a palm tree to stay. There were some deck chairs that they can use, Kit was pretty comfortable but Riley was struggling with his ginormous butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you didn&#39;t tell me if you&#39;re gay or not. I don&#39;t wanna waste my time if you&#39;re a straight guy.&quot; Kit said while he took off his sunglasses, closed his eyes and rested on the deck chair. &quot;I want a nice tan before I leave. So. Would you help me with lotion? It&#39;s in my bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley didn&#39;t reply, he didn&#39;t know what implications would bring telling Kit his orientation and he didn&#39;t want to something that he could regret... again. So, instead, he took Kit&#39;s bag and took the lotion. He noticed that the speedo and flip flops were still in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I was looking for a nudist beach. That&#39;s why I have these swimming trunks on, because I was planning to take them out.&quot; Kit said while Riley put some lotion on his calloused hands. &quot;Do you know if there&#39;s one of those near here? Or, maybe, I can wear that speedo instead. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Riley could give an answer, Kit took the speedo and extended it to get a better look. &quot;It&#39;s huge!&quot; He exclaimed while he grinned. &quot;I don&#39;t even know they make speedo that big! I think it&#39;s for guys like, don&#39;t you think so? Anyway, while I&#39;m not walking I can use it, so...&quot; Kit was ready to wear the speedo when he was suddenly stopped by Riley who had unexpectedly kissed him. Kit was surprised but instead of pushing him away, he kissed Riley back.<br />
<br />
Riley can&#39;t believe what he had done. He really didn&#39;t want his idol to turn into a hairy fat man, so he acted before thinking. His thick lips were now making contact with Kit&#39;s while his eyes were shacking in fear and shock. A few seconds later, he can feel something moving in his mouth, it was Kit&#39;s tongue who had trespassed his lips and now was shaking and dancing over his own tongue.<br />
<br />
A few second later, Kit&#39;s hand were caressing Riley&#39;s broad back which fortunately wasn&#39;t hairy like his chest. Cause he was on top, Riley was holding his own weight with his arms so he won&#39;t crush Kit while his legs still stayed on his deck chair. He was almost motionless, which gave Kit the perfect chance to do whatever he wants with him. And Kit didn&#39;t waste time because he had already started to put his hands inside Riley&#39;s blue speedo and squeezing his fat ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nick was returning to his hotel room disappointed that he can&#39;t find a solution for his friend&#39;s problem. He was holding a bag that he received in the info booth and he occasionally looked at it while he think of his options.</p>
