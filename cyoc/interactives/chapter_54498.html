<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was early morning when Kevin Lobsteroid climbed back into his host <br />
body. There was a loud burp as gas was forced out to accommodate the <br />
alien master. Chad woke raising one eye stalk to look at Kevin. It <br />
was so surreal. At first he thought it was a dream, and then he <br />
realized it was no dream. He stood up on his hind legs, and flexed <br />
his claws. They were far more intricate than an Earth lobster's claws. <br />
He realized they could handle delicate tools once he mastered them. <br />
He was still a bit clumsy in his new body. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how exactly do I turn some guy into my body suit?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, basically, you've got to hypnotize him. It's not that hard <br />
really. Then you climb inside his mouth and go down his esophagus to <br />
this lungs and carve out your niche. It's actually instinctual. Our <br />
ancestors were parasites or symbiotes if you prefer, and our original <br />
hosts were sort of like sabertooth tigers and mammoths and yeti-like <br />
ape creatures. Humans are far better hosts. We'll be breeding them <br />
for export. I'm guessing Mars and Venus could be terra-formed within <br />
a few months of the rescue ship arriving. The problem was my <br />
hyperspace communications were damaged in my collision, and so I could <br />
only activate my sub-light distress beacon. So it's easy as soon as <br />
you decide on a body. Then all I have to do is get him alone-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've decided. Taylor Lautner will be my host body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice choice, but wont he be a little hard to find? I mean he's a celebrity who knows where <br />
he is right now.&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; said Chad, &quot;He's supposed to be in town filming for another one of those stupid <br />
vampire movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then let's get going!&quot;<br />
<br />
Later...<br />
<br />
Kevin walked up the guy guarding the entrance to the film set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me son, what are you doing back here this is a closed set. I'm going to have to ask <br />
you to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin, ignoring the man's protests quickly grabbed him by the collar of his shirt. He then <br />
opened his mouth and breathed out a sickly green colored gas. Then man fell down, <br />
unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; asked Chad, from inside the duffle bag he was being carried in.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's another ability our species has. You remember the smell when i exited my suit <br />
yesterday? Well we can shoot out a concentrated version of that from our bodies. <br />
Conveniently, in addition to knocking humans out it overloads their brain, so they don't <br />
remember a thing. I can shoot it out of my suits mouth, or even his asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinky&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll teach you to that later, now let's get inside and get you that body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before going inside Kevin stole the guard's uniform and moved the unconscious body <br />
behind a dumpster. After a little searching Kevin found Taylor Lautner's dressing room. <br />
Testing the knob he found it was unlocked so he slowly and quietly opened the door. He <br />
saw Taylor Lautner sitting in an armchair listening to an ipod with his eyes closed. Taking <br />
advantage of the opportunity he grabbed some rope and duct tape out of the duffel bag <br />
and dashed over to Taylor. First he ducked taped his mouth shut then with lightning speed <br />
he tied his wrists down to the arms of the chair. AS soon as he was touched Taylors eyes <br />
jerked open and he began struggling, now in his subdued position the tried to wiggle free, <br />
but could not.<br />
<br />
&quot;I needed to tie him down so I'd have time to knock him out with my ass gas. It's more <br />
potent if I shoot it out there rather than from my mouth.&quot; Kevin explained.<br />
<br />
He proceeded to take off his pants and boxers. Then he bent over and aimed his ass at <br />
Taylor, who by this point was scared half to death. Then he shot out the gas and after a few <br />
seconds of struggling Taylor passed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Chad its time.&quot; Kevin said, &quot;Climb down his throat like i told you before and let your <br />
instincts do the rest. It should only take about ten minutes. I'll hind behind the door and <br />
blast anyone who comes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Kevin here i go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin watched as Chad cimbed his way up Taylor Lautner's body and make his way to his <br />
face. When Chad reached his face he used a claw to pry Taylor's mouth open and squeezed <br />
himself in. Kevin could see Taylor's throat stretch to accommodate Chad's body as he made <br />
his way down the throat. <br />
<br />
Ten minutes later...<br />
<br />
Suddenly Taylor's body stirred, and his eyes opened. Kevin walked over and removed the <br />
duct tape and untied his wrists.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he asked, &quot;How does it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Chad began, smiling as he used Taylors voice, &quot;It feels orgasmic, and i can <br />
control him completely. And wow, his dick feels huge, i gotta see for myself.<br />
<br />
Getting up from the chair he began to take his shirt off, pausing for a moment to feel <br />
Taylor's washboard abs before moving on to his pants. After all his clothes were off Chad <br />
and Kevin both admired Taylors now hard 10' cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Kevin, &quot;And i though i picked a good body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin,&quot; Chad breathed lustfully, &quot;This is turning me on so much, let's fuck, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't tried that before with two of us in human bodies, but that sounds really hot, and <br />
i can't resist that body, so lets go.<br />
<br />
Kevin stripped down to his birthday suit and walked slowly over to Chad/Taylor. Chad <br />
didn't want to waste anymore time and grabbed Kevin by the dick and started to give him a <br />
blow job. Kevin moaned in pure ecstasy. Chad stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, you know what would make this even more sexy, lets both shoot our gasses, it <br />
made me really horny yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; was all Kevin could manage before Chad had flipped him down and over and was <br />
licking his asshole. Both of them released their gasses and Kevin began to deep throat <br />
Chad/Taylor's 10' cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chad... I need you in me now!&quot; Kevin screamed.<br />
<br />
Without bothering to respond Chad grabbed Kevin's ass and jammed his cock in. Pumping <br />
in and out with dangerous ferocity. The suits assholes seemed to make things even hotter. <br />
They stretched just enough for a dick to fit in and then once it was in constricted their <br />
muscles around it. Soon both of them came all over each other and they just laid their, <br />
panting heavily.</p>
