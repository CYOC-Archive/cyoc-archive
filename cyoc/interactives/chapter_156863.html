<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say that the conversation Laura now had with Annette and Hannah was surreal would be an understatement. As the two grown down adults now shared everything that had happened since Laura had found them made everyone’s head spin. Laura couldn’t help but feel like she was in the middle of a conversation with a pair of siblings as they talked. Looking themselves over she quickly realized that was exactly what the three of them looked like right now.<br />
<br />
Annette for her part was at first doubtful before coming to believe Laura and Hannah’s stories. It helped that Hannah relayed things to her granddaughter that only a grandmother would know. Still, Annette was flabbergasted by the idea that her own grandmother was now only five years older than she was. “Okay grandma lets say that this true and I’m not just having a crazy dream,” she said. “How do we fix this?”<br />
<br />
“Our friend here figured out where this Magic Shop is,” Hannah said gesturing towards Laura. “Tomorrow morning before your parents wake up the three of us go there. Then maybe we can fix things and return to normal.” Annette nodded, a sad look etched on her face. Laura quickly noticed this and was about to ask a question before noticing Hannah give her a look. Laura stayed quiet, allowing the grandmother to finish. “So grandma what do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
“Well Laura and I are going to need some new clothes,” Hannah chuckled, gesturing to her baggy robe. “I don’t think my usual things would look right.”<br />
<br />
“You can borrow some of mine,” Laura stated. “I actually bought somethings when I was still a teenager. Your about my size when I was 15 so they should fit.”<br />
<br />
“Oh great,” Hannah smirked. “I knew I was skinny but didn’t know I would fit a 15 year olds clothes.”<br />
<br />
“I was tall for my age,” Laura said quickly, blushing fiercely as Annette began to giggle. “I was joking sweetie,” Hannah grinned. “Annette will tell you, her grandma is kind of sarcastic.” Annette nodded, causing Laura to blush slightly as she trailed off. “I’ll go find something for you and Laura grandma, I should have somethings from the last time mom bought me clothes. You know how she likes to buy things a little large.” Annette smiled thanking her granddaughter as the young girl now quietly crept downstairs.<br />
<br />
As Laura and Hannah now waited for her to return, Laura now found herself wanting to ask Hannah so many questions. Hannah for her part was now standing in front of a full length mirror in the attic. Despite a layer of film on the old mirror, Hannah posed in front of it admiring her teenage body. “How are you Hannah,” Laura asked.<br />
<br />
Hannah turns smiling as she now gazed down at her hands. “Quite well actually,” she said as she looked at her youthful hands. “I haven’t felt this full of energy in so long. I’m still in awe at how young I look.” Laura watched as Hannah examined herself, lifting her foot out of her slipper, smiling at how smooth her feet now looked. “Best pedicure I’ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
“You seem really comfortable with this Hannah,” Laura stated. “How come you’re not freaking out. When I became a teenager I Damn near fainted.”<br />
<br />
Hannah sighed as she now put her slippers back on. “Well too be honest it’s because of Annette.” Laura raised an eyebrow as Hannah now sat down, gathering her large robe around her. “You see my daughter Beth, Annette’s mom, is my youngest,” she said. “Beth didn’t decide to get married or even have children until she was quite a bit older. By the time Annette was born I was already quite old.”<br />
<br />
Laura could only nod as Hannah now sighed, seeming to stare off into space. “Annette is my youngest grandchild,” she said. “I always wished I was able to be more active with her when she was growing up. Sure I do the typical grandma things like bake cookies and such but I used to be so much more active. I was always the fun grandma with my other grandkids. The grandma that would take the kids on roller coasters, go camping, even took the kids go cart wrestling. My kids were so angry when they heard that one.”<br />
<br />
Laura grinned as Hannah now smiled remembering fondly the memories she had given her other grandkids. “So have you done those things with Annette?”<br />
<br />
Hannah shook her head sadly, hanging it slightly. “Couldn’t anymore,” she sighed. “Between my arthritis, bad eye sight, and a heart condition I had to start taking it easy. It’s a shame really, of all my grandkids Annette reminds me the most of me.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Laura asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” Hannah said warmly. “The girl is so adventurous and curious about the world. The two of us get along like peanut butter and jelly. Even if her old grandma has to take it easy.”<br />
<br />
Laura nodded as she took this all in, maybe Hannah’s statement about fate finding them was accurate. “So you see Laura,” she said. “That’s why I’m so happy to be young again.”<br />
<br />
“But what if you become even younger?”<br />
<br />
Hannah shrugged, smiling at Laura but offering no answer. To Laura it seemed like Hannah wouldn’t mind shaving off a few more years if it meant she could have some fun with Annette.<br />
<br />
With several hours until morning Laura, Hannah, and Annette now tried to get some sleep. Sleep though was almost impossible for Laura as fears of herself growing younger flooded her dreams. Finally shaken out of her nightmares in the early morning, she stretched and groggily got out of bed.  Hannah for her part had made sure to cover for the three of them, leaving a note for Annette’s mother saying she was taking Laura to her home before taking Annette out for breakfast. While Laura worried that Hannah’s daughter would be worried, Hannah quickly dismissed it. Dressing in a pair of borrowed jeans and T-shirt from Annette the two 12 year olds now met a 17 year old Hannah in the driveway. Hannah had borrowed some of Laura’s teenage clothing, now sporting a pair of jeans and a very pretty shirt, which Laura realized she filled out quite well. As they piled into the car, dice safely secured the group now began the drive towards the Magic Shop.<br />
<br />
“So I looked up the address Grandma,” Annette said as she checked her phone. “It’s a quick drive but what’s weird is the area. I thought it was abandoned.”<br />
<br />
“Mysterious Magic Shop in an abandoned part of town,” Hannah smirked. “Seems like something out of one of those stories you read on the internet.” Laura and Annette couldn’t help but giggle as Hannah now pulled out of the driveway. As Hannah now reached a stop sign she turned towards Laura and Annette giving the two girls a warm smile. Turning onto the street Hannah began to drive down the street only to have a stray dog  dart in front of the car.<br />
<br />
Hannah slammed on the brakes, causing the car to jolt to a stop. Hannah breathed a sigh of relief until she noticed the orbs of light begin to float off her body.<br />
<br />
Seventeen years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but twelve. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.<br />
<br />
Laura’s eyes went wide as she now watched Hannah. The teens delicate features began to grow softer as she raced backwards in age. Hannah shrank several inches as puberty began to reverse itself. Grasping her body Hannah could feel her breasts beginning to shrink, going from a pair of perky b cups to two softball sized mounds. Finally Hannah watched as her legs grew smaller, slowly shrinking away from the pedals. As the lights vanished the now 12 year old girl stared at herself in stunned silence. Despite being reduced to a preteen, Hannah appeared to be quite calm.<br />
<br />
“I’m okay,” she said, wincing at the childish tenor of her voice. Carefully pulling the car over and putting it in park she now turned towards Laura and Annette. “I guess were walking.” Laura could only nod in shock as the three 12 year olds now exited the car. Hopefully the three of them could reach the Magic Shop without any further problems.</p>
