<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not long after they got home Brad was working out in his room, already planning to teach Andy a lesson and turn him into Rob.  Their parents were out for the day, likely not to return until late in the evening.  Conditions were perfect to spend some good, brother time with the football star Rob.  With renewed strength and determination he finished his set, wiped the sweat from his brow and walked over to Andy’s room.  In contrast to Brad’s large, relatively clean room which he adorned with his sports trophies and posters of cheerleaders Andy’s room was small, with clothes and surfing magazines scattered in piles every which way and the foul stench of pot drifted into the hall.  Brad covered his nose at the offensive odor.  Andy lay in his bed, likely blazed as he stared up into the ceiling and listened to his stoner music through his headphones.  Brad never liked any of that crap, like all the popular jocks it was rap all the way, better to win over the ladies and fuel his already burdening ego.  Andy soon noticed his brother hovering over him and took off his headphones; his eyes were already dilated as he sat up and gave a stupid grin.  Unknown to Brad, Andy was not going to hesitate he wanted to see Chad as soon as possible, he was sick of his bossy older brother.<br />
<br />
“Wassup dude?”  He asked, drawing out each word as if it was a struggle to speak.  The long, sleepy syllables only fed Brad’s frustration and reassured him he was doing the right thing.  “Nothing much man, was just thinking we need to hang out more like real brothers don’t you think?”  Andy’s smile broadened and he nodded his head.  “So right dude we do need to hang out more… Chad.”  Brad looked confused and then stumbled back, the name hit him, there was power behind the word, power and a familiarity like it struck a certain part of him.  Thoughts raced through Brad’s mind, first he realized he had obviously been duped, he had been chipped as well, he could already feel the change being pumped into his blood stream and a voice in the back of his head whispering to him to be like his brother.  He knew he had to fight it, he had no other choice, he couldn’t let himself be a brainless stoner like his brother, they were so dumb and like relaxed and laid back…  He shook his head defiantly; already the chip was beginning to assert control.  It wouldn’t be long until Brad was Chad, Andy’s ideal stoner brother.  Already he felt his will being nibbled at; his muscles ached soon to be much smaller.<br />
<br />
“Cmon dude don’t fight it Chad, be like me!  We’ll like get stoned and shit together it’ll be totally awesome!”  To the growing part of Brad that was now Chad that did sound good, he stared down at the floor feeling like he was going to be sick as he watched the carpet race up to greet him, he was dropping in height, all those proud inches that made him the indomitable force on the football team we’re slipping away, little by little until he was staring his once ‘little’ brother right in the eye.  His jersey from earlier that had once looked painted on was now barely clinging to him, ready to fall off at any moment.  His cargoes likewise were down to about his ankles and he had to constantly pull them up to keep them from sliding off completely.  “Those fucking liars I’m gunna… I’m… like totally lovin this dude!”  Brad’s hands raced to cover his mouth; he never meant to say that.  Not only was he talking like his stoner brother but even his tone had changed, the power in his voice replaced by the slow, subtleness of his brother, the laid back tone that he had once hated.  His eyes swept the room desperately looking for something to help him, someway to escape.  He saw his brother’s CD collection: Sublime, Dirty Heads, Red Hot Chili Peppers… somehow he knew all the songs, they played in his head as if he had grown up listening to them.  He tried to think, to focus and force Chad, he thought of rap, of sports, of football statistics but all those bored and disgusted him now.  “Awesome, you sounded like me!  Do it again Chad!  Say ‘dude’!”  Brad violently shook his head, noticing a lot more hair waving about as he did, his once short blond hair creeping down past his ears closer to his shoulders.  But his body and mind we’re at the mercy of the chip and his brother.  “Dude!” He exclaimed slowly and with more enthusiasm, adopting his brother’s dopey grin for a moment as he mentally screamed at himself.  His voice had raised a few octaves now sounding like a mid-puberty teen and not a giant jock anymore.  He looked down at his arms as they trembled uncontrollably in agony, his muscles dwindled away, giving way to nice even tone.  His arms became shorter and more proportional to his short frame.  His giant hands became smaller with slender careful fingers that automatically knew how to roll a perfect blunt.  Like a dark wave a tan just like his brothers washed over his arms and hands making his skin golden brown, flawless and with only few blond hairs instead of the many he had before.  The wave moved across his body, slowly but surely.  He felt it working under his jersey and gave minimum resistance as Andy helped him out of it.<br />
<br />
“From now on dude you hate wearing shirts, you only put that shit on when you have to, its boardies and flip flops for you dude.”  Chad/Brad secretly smiled at the thought of dressing like a surfer, the clothes part of him still loathed sounded so comfortable and liberating now.  He barely noticed as his chest took on the same golden brown hue as his arms, all the hair falling out except a small blond treasure trail on his slight six-pack.  Not a hair was to be found on toned but small pecs. He looked down at his revealed chest, loving and hating it.  Chad thought he looked sexy; Brad was mortified at his lean, disgustingly figure.  Brad blushed in embarrassment as the changing wave worked its way down south causing his pants and boxers to finally slide off revealing his large equipment which sadly dwindled down a few inches as it regressed in age like the rest of him.  Andy snickered.  “Don’t worry dude, soon you’ll see how awesome pot is, you’ll forget all about sex.”  Brad felt his once thick legs now slender, almost smooth but very tan sticks.  His calfs and thighs were toned and sizable from surfing but they were nothing compared to what he once had.  Brad walked forward, stepping out of his too large clothes, even his shoes and socks were ridiculously big on him and fell right off exposing his small, slender size 7 feet which were just as tan as the rest of him.  His socks and size 14 boats vanished into thin air leaving him cold and stark naked in his brother’s room with a mind and body that were quickly turning against him.  Brad felt his hands move on their own accord as he eagerly grabbed a pair boardies identical to his brothers and slid them on over his tan legs, they felt so awesome.  Andy found a pair of old flip flops and helped his brother into them, they fit perfectly, hugged every curve of his feet.  He wiggled his toes, Chad in almost full control of his body.<br />
<br />
“Please dude, I mean Andy you gotta like stop thissss is so sweet!”  Chad’s eyes rolled back as another wave of changes racked his body and mind, his nostrils caught the sweet scent of weed, he sniffed the air finding to his pleasure and humiliation it was coming from him.  He watched in the mirror as within seconds his eyes dilated, though they remained green there was now something different about them, the keenness and sharpness was lost, like nobody was home anymore.  His shoulders slouched as his overall posture became forced into that of a carefree stoner, a general disregard and goofiness gripping his fa&ccedil;ade as a witless smile permanently etched itself onto his face.  His blonde hair continued to lengthen until just past his shoulders becoming thick and messy.  A tickling feeling brought his attention back to his face where to his horror scraggly blond hairs were popping out his chin, one by one.  He plucked and pulled but to his bewilderment they grew faster than he could stop them until he had a shaggy stoner goatee.  He ran a hand through it slowly, hesitantly, enjoying the feel, wondering if he was already lost.  Part of him couldn’t help but enjoy the changes, they felt so right, he felt so relaxed, calm, his life had always been stressing about the next big game, the next test.  He made no motion to stop his brother as he lit a blunt and stuffed it into Chad’s waiting mouth, a few puffs were all it took to drive the rest of Brad deep deep down, trapped until the change was over.  So good, they thought, as Chad/Brad held the smoke in his lungs like an expert, letting the chemicals take over his mind.  As he felt Chad overshadow him he thought, at least I won’t have to worry about anything…  The new Chad put an arm around his awesome brother.  “Dude pot is sweet; we gotta chill more often bro!”  Andy smiled.  “We will, I’ll make sure of it.”</p>
