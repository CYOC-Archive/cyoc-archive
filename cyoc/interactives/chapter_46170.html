<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I continued to walk down the street, people scattered at the sight of a 10 foot muscle-god walking <br />
down the street. Each step I took, I could feel the power surging in my quads and calves. They were <br />
aching to be tested! Within ten feet was an intersection, as I approached I didn't bother to look if <br />
there  was any traffic approaching - as far as I was concerned traffic should watch out for ME! Walking <br />
across the street, I suddenly heard the screeching of brakes and as I turned to look at the chaos I was <br />
causing, I felt a huge thud in my right arm. There was a terrible screeching of tortured metal and as I <br />
looked over to my right I realized that Max had been on my right shoulder. <br />
 <br />
What awaited me when I looked over sent me into a blind rage. A bus unable to stop in time had been <br />
STOPPED dead in its tracks my my huge unmovable body. The front end had hit me at about 50mph and the <br />
metal had warped around me like hot knife through butter. To me it felt as if a piece of rubber had hit me <br />
but the evidence of MY sheer power was now evident as the whole front end had bent inwards and where it <br />
had hit me there was a huge impression of my superb physique.<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately for Max he had been pulverized on impact and was now just a broken lifeless pile of pulped <br />
body caught between iron and my harder stronger body. I was so pissed off at this buses inability to stop <br />
and the bus drivers arrogance for not hitting something less important than ME. So I removed myself from <br />
the impression I had made in the front and as the driver saw the HATE swell on my eyes he gunned the accelerator. <br />
BIG MISTAKE!!!<br />
 <br />
I put out my arms to stop  the advancing bus which slammed into me at 20 mph and my hands sunk into <br />
the metal with contemptuous ease. this would be fun I thought and it will teach everyone a valuable <br />
lesson about hitting ME.<br />
<br />
With that I added some power to my push and the bus began to shift backwards a foot or two even though <br />
the driver was still gunning the accelerator. He put his foot flat now to the floor and I easily matched <br />
the power horse for weak horse, to be honest I hadn't even begun really trying! Such a large man-made object <br />
considered so powerful and here I was OUTMUSCLING it like it was a mere toy, which it was to me. It then <br />
suddenly dawned on me that the results of the formula may have been even beyond what I had thought was <br />
HUMANLY possible, yes humanly but not godly.<br />
 <br />
Now I added some heft to my pushing and the metal began to squeal as the engine was pushing forward and I was <br />
pushing back. Foot after agonizing foot until the bus hit a reinforced bank wall as it had begun to skid to the <br />
left of the road. People on the bus now began to scream blood curdling screams as they realized what was in store <br />
for them if they remained. the panic of 50 people an the bus all running around and screaming had no effect on my <br />
shoving and the bus now emitted a low groan as the metal began to feel REAL POWER as I turned it up a notch. The <br />
frame buckled slightly and the door wouldn't open any longer as the frame was warped by ME. Everyone was now trapped <br />
on the bus awaiting their now undeniable fate.<br />
 <br />
As I crushed the buses frame, I felt a stirring in  my pants and I realized that being so powerful and having <br />
the decision over life and death of so many was really a turn on. with this ion mind I shoved harder and the <br />
bus moaned and squealed in protest but was helpless against my muscle. The engine now had given up the fight, <br />
all this time the driver had not taken his foot off the accelerator. With a  loud bang it died a mechanical death. <br />
with less resistance now the bus crumpled even quicker, I relished the fact that metal was deforming in my hands <br />
like tissue paper, it had no resistance against MY muscle.<br />
 <br />
The bus was now two thirds it original length and the driver still mesmerized realized that his life was now <br />
in danger as the seat he was in had been forced back into the aft bulkhead that separated the driver from the <br />
rest of the bus, but it was too late the dashboard had crumpled into his legs and pulverized them into powder <br />
he was trapped in that seat. the rear had also crumpled allot and the remaining passengers were all frantically <br />
trying to escape by any means they could. some however had resigned them selves to their fate and just sat there <br />
quietly waiting for the end to come.<br />
 <br />
This was so easy so I decide to speed it up  a little as I was getting bored. My legs bulged and the calves <br />
split into huge horseshoe splits which cracked the asphalt as I compacted the bus. I shoved harder and the bus <br />
responded by crushing deeper and quicker. The driver now had the reinforced glass pressing against him and the <br />
bulkhead behind with each exertion he was compacted more and more until finally his body could not take any <br />
more punishment and with a huge red explosion he popped like a ripe melon in a vice.<br />
 <br />
Other passengers were also being crushed into the seating and bulkhead and frame as it twisted and contorted to <br />
MY muscle. their bodies were do weak and fragile it took no extra effort to destroy them whilst mashing this toy <br />
into the wall. Within ten minutes of the start of the episode it was all over the bus had been reduce to the length<br />
of a mini sized car and not a single passenger had been able to escape the massacre - unfortunate for them, they <br />
shouldn't have been there in the first place when the bus had hit ME.<br />
 <br />
When I turned my attention to the road and pavement I noticed that a large audience had gathered and were in awe <br />
of what they had just witnessed. But this was soon drowned out  by the sound of wailing -  Police sirens and fire <br />
engine rushing the scene to help and arrest the perpetrators. Well they weren't going to be expecting ONE man  to <br />
have been able to do all this so the force had sent ten cars to the scene and two fire engines had been sent  as <br />
the report suggested a terrorist bomb may be to blame.<br />
 <br />
Boy were they in for a SURPRISE and I was going to have some real fun</p>
