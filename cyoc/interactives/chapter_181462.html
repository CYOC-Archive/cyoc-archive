<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;d love to have you along but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re mature enough for what it entails, that&#39;s all...&quot; Katie sighed to her sister. &quot;Sometimes I wish you were as old as us, then maybe we can all hang out together and understand how the adult life is like.&quot; That last statement did it for Katie; maybe if she were the same age as her friends, then she wouldn’t be treated like a kid anymore. Silently she wished to age fifteen years older. As the warmth began in her body, Katie felt her pajamas shifting and becoming smaller on a steadily growing body. Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt. Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish. She giggled and swung her legs and watched with fascination as her toes drifted further and further to the floor of the carpet, until the balls of her feet touched...then the flats, then the heels, She sighed in elation and realization that she was growing up, finally able to touch her feet to the floor of most places at last, though a part of her somehow wished she could swing her legs at times.<br />
<br />
The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange. Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve, at the same time her legs and arms gained a distinct tone to them as if she&#39;d spent every day running, playing and moving. Her stomach gurgled as it also flattened and toned nicely, and she could watch the change as it spread along her bare belly and along her belly button, leaving her abdomen neatly pretty like she&#39;d seen girls who entered surfing competitions. <br />
<br />
By now her pajama bottoms had started to feel a bit snug as she felt a new strange tingling beneath it, she felt a warmth as within her insides her body began to approach the age of adolescence. She could not see the changes, but she distinctly felt them, letting out a little gasp as new thoughts and understands began to grow in her young preteen mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im....entering puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought excited and terrified her and the changes weren&#39;t done. She could see her face in the window as the cute, childlike features began to define. Her button nose was still that, but it was starting to even out. The freckles on her face were less prevalent and her teeth rearranged as some adult ones grew in. She gained a certain maturity, a certain beginning of beauty as her hair began to flow long to her back and around her newly pierced ears. A prick and pain and looking down she found her ring had become a third piercing on her belly button, as if it has always been there.<br />
<br />
She soon sprouted a six more inches as she started to go through her first growth spurt, ageing her up into her teen years. Now she was around five-foot-sic in height and still growing. But that’s not all that’s changing. Katie’s chest started to feel numb as her nipples started to poke out of her shirt. The fat around the nipples started to explain and grew, turning from small mounds to pointy cone, marking the beginning of her breasts. Fatty deposits started to form on her hips as they slowly expand a bit, beginning to form curves. Her rear started to expand a little as well to accommodate her early curves. Her arms and legs grew a little longer, but muscle growth started to form on her lanky frame. She looked towards her hands and could see them getting big and dainty, as her fingers grew thinner right before her eyes and nails growing out. Almost immediately, she could feel something strange in her groined and moaned in both surprise and pleasure. Turns out, her expanded knowledge made her realize that she’s going through her period and is one step closer to womanhood. Her face started to mature a little bit as her face started to change shape and matured more and her freckles faded more. Her nose was starting to get longer and thinner as she was loosing her precious button nose. As she was looking at the mirror, she could feel something strange in her teeth and started to feel metal around her tongue. Opening her mouth, she could see what looked like braces. You scratched your head and wondered how they got there. That’s when she remembered her mental changes were kicking up as knowledge for grade school kept expanding. Along that were growing memories as she remembered she obtained these braces when she was thirteen. She figured that since her teeth were a little messed up, she needed brace to straighten her teeth. Her hair has reached her shoulder and was lightened in color from dark brown to medium brown. <br />
<br />
“Katie! What’s the matter with you!” she shouted.<br />
<br />
“What?” Katie jumped up from her seat.<br />
<br />
“Why are you wearing those jammies? It’s so small on you.” Kellie pointed to Katie&#39;s outfit and indeed, she wasn&#39;t lying as Katie wearing her old seven-year-old pajamas complete with a pink Barbie T shirt and sweat pants. Seams were struggling to keep up with her expanding form as it failed to cover her abdominals and lower calves from view. “You’re not a kid anymore, you can’t wear pajamas in public even if you were able to fit.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit, they&#39;ve really been wearing out of LATE!&quot; Katie yelped as her pajamas ripped apart under the pressure of another growth spurt, growing another four to five inches for a full height of five-foot-ten, matching her former mother in terms of stature. At the same time, her body expanded in all places and it felt enjoyable for her. Her breasts started to expand, going from cones and A cups, all the way to perky B cups. Her hips widen a bit more and the curves escalate, forming a teen like hourglass. Her read expanded a bit more and looked like a bubble. Her arms and legs gained more muscles while growing and were toning up more and more. It was obvious that Katie like to go outside and play when she was young. But now that she’s growing older, all those years of playing really gave her an athletic ability. Even knowledge of high school seep into her brain, including athletics accomplishments including soccer, track and field, and some karate. Katie didn’t mind as she felt her active body feeling shapely and flexible. Her face kept looking older as there are little hints of childhood left behind. Her face was thinner and less rounded while her nose was longer and looking elegant. Her lips started to gain fat and began to puff up. There were a little freckles left on her face, but she was notices a couple of pimples dotted on her face. She could tell that she was getting into her awkward teen phase. But she knew that will be all over, as she will grow out of that phase. Her hair grew longer as they passed her shoulders and started to shine through the light. Katie blushed as she covered her growing breasts with her swelling arms. &quot;You&#39;re right... I probably should get changed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie scrambled into her room as her legs slowly lengthened from a final growth spurt into adulthood. Her breasts increased in size and turned into a perfect pair of C cup melons. She cupped on with her now dainty hands and was amazed at how soft, yet heavy they were. Her hips grew more and her curves were shapely while her rear blown up further to complete her sultry hourglass look. The muscles on her arms and legs had feminine muscles that were toned and think enough to pass as a young athletic woman. She could even see a bit of abs on her toned stomach. Her face had already adult with little childish features remain. Her skull structure was completely oval as all the pimples and freckles vanished completely leaving nothing but smooth and flawless skin. Her nose was long and thin as her eyes were less cute and innocent and more sultry and mature. Her lips were puffy and devious as she felt her braces disappeared, opening her mouth to reveal her perfectly align pearly white teeth. Her hair grew longer as it went down past her shoulders and looked completely fuller. She entered her room to find it has changed dramatically while she grew before her sister. Gone were the toys she had as a girl and posters. In their place was something an adult woman would have. Her once small bed had expanded and widen to a queenside with silk like blankets. There was a desk next to it that has the most advanced computer and workstation with pens, pencils, and books for college. There’s a nightstand on the other side with a digital clock to wake her up. A dresser was next to it that is filled with lingerie and other private stuff with picture frames on top. Her closet that was once filled with kid like clothing was now replaced with suits and dresses for adults, along with long skirts and crop tops. A make up counter was on one end of the wall that was filled with a variety of makeup she could apply when she wishes to. She has a wide screen TV on the other side with a built in cable system for her to watch TV on her bed. And to top it off, she had a diploma over her bed to show her accomplishment. Katie looked to the room and was in awe by the sight of it all as she picked out a bra for herself.<br />
<br />
She continued to grow older as what’s left of her height grew over six feet, going through her last growth spurt. Her body started to fill up nicely as she looked like a full-grown woman. Her breasts grew to a well-rounded D-Cup size which her brassier snugly cuddled as she clipped it on, shaking them to see how full and bouncy they were. Her hips grew wider and her ass expanded outward, making her hourglass very curvy and shapely. Her muscle tone was firm and strong as her skin darkened a little more to show off her tan. Her face had no child like qualities left as she was starring at an adult woman’s face with an oval structure, thin and long nose, small to sultry eyes, and kissable lips. Her hair grew a little longer and was down her lower back. She slid on her panties and noted that both that and her bra were made from this see through material that shows her nipples and pussy. A now 24-year-old Katie watched in awe as she saw an adult woman starring at the mirror instead of a little girl. She could feel her brain filled with knowledge of college, and even her body language changed as well as she placed her hand on her hip and smirked very deliciously. “Hmm… Not bad for a young woman.” she said with her voice a few octaves lower. The change now complete, she looked to the newly-materialized degree and felt like she was ready to take on the world.</p>
