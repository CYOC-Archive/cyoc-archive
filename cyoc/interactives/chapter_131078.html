<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ginger O&#39;Toole was at her family&#39;s dining room table, already well into her homework that afternoon, when her brother Fred finally returned home.<br />
&quot;Hey Sis,&quot; said Fred, coming into the dining room after grabbing his book bag off the living room sofa, where he left it before going back out after school.<br />
&quot;Well, I can tell what kind of an afternoon you&#39;ve had,&quot; replied Ginger, while sniffing the air. Although brother and sister were still in their normal forms at the moment, her weretiger senses were as acute as ever.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Fred with a smile, thinking back over the brief, but athletic session of sex he had with his girlfriend. &quot;How&#39;s your afternoon been?&quot; he asked, sitting down next to his sister.<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just okay? I thought you were going to spend some time with that new kid,&quot; said Fred, referring to John Harper, who was staying at the Jenkins house down the street from them.<br />
&quot;I did.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is everything all right? If he&#39;s hurt you somehow...&quot; growled Fred, feeling protective of his sister.<br />
&quot;No. In fact, quite the opposite.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? You hurt him somehow?&quot; asked a confused Fred.<br />
&quot;No. He is hurt though.&quot;<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I never laid a paw on him. All John Harper&#39;s abuse happened before he came to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s been abused?&quot; said her shocked brother.<br />
&quot;He called it a very <i>strict</i> upbringing,&quot; explained Ginger. &quot;I&#39;ll be surprised if I&#39;m wrong about this, although I&#39;m not certain exactly how badly he, let alone the rest of his siblings, had it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Geez,&quot; said Fred, stopping to think about the situation. &quot;We&#39;ve heard some scuttlebutt about Jennifer Harper ever since she was scratched by that rogue and became a werevixen against her will, but you know how rumors and gossip are. I mean, until today...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Ginger. &quot;Something like this appears in the news occasionally, but this close to home, and to someone you at least kind of know...&quot;<br />
&quot;What kind of parents would do something like that to their own kids?&quot;<br />
Ginger had no answer at first, for she had been thinking about him ever since parting company with John. Finally, she said, &quot;It&#39;s a tough situation. You want to help, but ain&#39;t sure how.&quot;<br />
&quot;And even worse if you&#39;re directly involved.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. From what little John was willing to say, I think it&#39;s the father more than the mother, although at the very least she&#39;s probably guilty of neglect and turning a blind eye to the father&#39;s actions,&quot; presumed Ginger.<br />
&quot;I wonder if this might have anything to do with Janice Harper&#39;s fixation with wanting to be a mermaid, especially now that she knows it&#39;s possible.&quot;<br />
Ginger just shrugged her shoulders, before the O&#39;Toole siblings grew silent for a bit.<br />
Then Fred said, &quot;I may not agree with everything they&#39;ve done at times, but I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve got the parents we have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot;<br />
Fred wasn&#39;t sure what else to say for a moment, and then asked, &quot;I know you like the guy, but what happens now?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just be there for John the best I can. Right now he needs a friend more than anything else,&quot; replied Ginger.<br />
&quot;Considering what you said to me about him last night, if you and John never do more than be best buddies, you&#39;ll be okay with that?&quot; asked Fred, recalling his sister&#39;s thoughts about the boy she just met yesterday.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to be. Won&#39;t I?&quot; was all his sister would say, not mentioning John&#39;s current uncertainty about his gender identity.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall held hands as he walked his fiance to her house.<br />
Eric wanted to talk.<br />
He needed to know more about Arthur Curtis, especially how he might fit into Julie&#39;s life.<br />
Yet the other were mer teenager was the one thing Julie DIDN&#39;T talk about on the way to her house.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been busy all day at school, yet risked leaving my phone on, just in case. But I still haven&#39;t heard anything from either mom or dad yet, so your guess is as good as mine as to whether or not she&#39;s pregnant,&quot; said Julie. &quot;But if mom is, it will affect our attending the were-mer assembly in the Pacific Ocean next summer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; was all Eric could say.<br />
&quot;Think about it. With today being November 2*, mom would be in her seventh month by next June. Even in her full mermaid form, she wouldn&#39;t be up to such a long distance swim. We might have to bow out. After all, dad wouldn&#39;t want to go solo and risk leaving mom alone that close to term, and the only way we&#39;d be allow to attend is if dad could arrange a proper chaperone for us. Then again, I wouldn&#39;t want to leave mom alone either the closer we get to whatever her projected due date is,&quot; pointed out Julie.<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; agreed Eric. &quot;Then again, I wouldn&#39;t want to go without you to begin with.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; said Julie with a smile, before giving Eric a quick peck on the cheek.<br />
&quot;Hmm... Unless they&#39;re in the garage already, I don&#39;t see any sign of mom or dad&#39;s cars,&quot; commented Julie, looking ahead toward her house.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure if there&#39;s news, they would at least say they&#39;ll tell you in person when they get home,&quot; observed Eric.<br />
&quot;True. Anyway, we&#39;ve also got to start thinking about Thanksgiving and Christmas...&quot;<br />
&quot;In what way?&quot; wondered Eric. &quot;I do plan on getting you something special for a Christmas gift,&quot; he added, although he had absolutely no idea what that might be even as he said the words.<br />
&quot;Well, who eats at whose house? Do you come to mine? Do I come to yours?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll work it out. After all, there&#39;s still a couple of weeks before we have to finalize that decision,&quot; Eric pointed out as they approached the Stovall residence.<br />
&quot;True. Then again, it seems like every year, the closer we get to a major holiday break, the more the teachers pile on the homework. Speaking of which, even without that oral report due Friday, gym is the only class that I didn&#39;t get a homework assignment in today.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got a lot too, so—&quot;<br />
&quot;So we better get right on it,&quot; said Julie, not realizing she cut Eric off. &quot;I&#39;ll Skype you after I confer with Arthur about our report tonight, if there&#39;s any time to do so before I go to bed.&quot;<br />
What he really wanted to say was suggest maybe sitting together and start tackling their homework as a couple, which would also give him a chance to talk about how he felt.<br />
Instead, all Eric could say was &quot;Sure,&quot; even as Julie gave him another peck on the cheek and ran to her front door.<br />
Eric stood there on the sidewalk until she was inside the house and the front door closed.<br />
Then he looked down at his hands.<br />
<i>Julie was so busy talking, she never noticed that I was in our Stage 1 form the whole walk together,</i> he complained to himself, while staring at the webbing between his fingers.<br />
As he went back to his normal form with the webbing receding into his hand, Eric stared again at the Stovall residence. &quot;I love her, but I can&#39;t be losing Julie. Can I? We&#39;re destined soul mates with a bright and wonderful future together. Right?&quot; he asked himself, but there was no reply in any way, shape, or form.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to do, Eric turned around and started walking back up Oak Street to his house.<br />
Yet he was so wrapped up in his confused thoughts, Eric Anderson never noticed the vehicle that followed him from school parked back where Oak meets Wood Street.<br />
The driver sat, checking her appearance in the mirror, while keeping an eye on her target.<br />
<i>Okay. Good thing I parked here instead of following them down Oak. He&#39;s alone now, so he must live somewhere here on Wood Street. Kind of an ironic address for such a handsome stud,</i> she thought.<br />
<i>As soon as he comes back up here, I&#39;ll introduce myself and see if he wants to have some fun this afternoon,</i> she added, feeling her nipples harden under her shirt and the moisture between her pants covered legs grow.<br />
