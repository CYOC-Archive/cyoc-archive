<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milo and Kara spent the rest of the day in their room rutting as they celebrated their union. Both fully accepting their fate as people of the sea. Neither bothered to examine themselves for new changes after they woke up from their short naps. Opting to roll and wrestle around in the sunken bed as they mated with each other. Be it Milo on top or Kara; they stayed awake long enough to ensure that Milo’s Cetacean like penis was constantly erect and firmly buried in Kara’s scaly snatch. It was roughly midnight when Milo and Kara were finally and truly exhausted with their continued act of love making.<br />
<br />
Kara sighed and smiled happily as she felt the latest load of Milo’s seed enter her; She was eager that it took root and they could begin being parents. Finding Milo’s large chest as a comfortable pillow she rests her head as she falls fast asleep; dreaming.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
“Push Kara,” Milo encouraging his wife; “I can see the head!”<br />
“Arrrrrrg,” Kara screamed; the carnal acts of love were wonderful. Bringing her to heights of joy she never experienced. The discovery of being pregnant after arriving at the mer settlement put her over the moon with joy. Despite the cramped living space of sharing a house with other mermaids; she and milo made the best of it. His job as an engineer helped them immensely and they were soon able to afford better living arraignments. Which was good as she was starting to show. Those memories quickly faded as another contraction forced her back to the present and she screamed as the head finally pushed through allowing the rest of their child to slide right out. Its cries were immediate as Milo caught the baby and smiled.<br />
“Our daughter,” Milo handing the baby to mother; his tears would be noticeable but were nonexistence as they were living in and breathing water.<br />
“Argggg,” Kara screamed again; Milo taking the newly born baby as he watched Kara gave birth to a second mer-child.<br />
“Another girl,” Milo smiling; “we have twin daughters my love.”<br />
“Bring them here,” Kara sounding exhausted; the labor was intense but well worth it as the two babies immediately latched onto a breast and started suckling.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Kara wakes up from her intense dream; back in the room at the mermaid resort both she and Milo were residing. Over the course of the night she must have slid off her husband because she was now nestled next to him. Getting spooned as his arms are wrapped around her in a loving embrace; she tried to shift and adjust but found her tail was heavy to move out of water.<br />
‘Wait,’ Kara now fully awake; ‘as she realized she could no long feel her legs. Reaching over to a button to turn on a light, she disturbs Milo as the light turns on and she sees a sight that confirms her suspicions.<br />
<br />
From her waist was a fifteen foot tail with blue scales. her feet were now a large blue tail fin. She looks at her hands and sees that they are webbed just like Milo’s. Small blue scales are mixed in within the skin around the thin membrane. She notices the thin frilly membrane that was growing on her hips has finished forming. Creating a border between fish and human.<br />
“Milo,” Kara whispering; “wake up! It’s happened!”<br />
“What’s happening,” Milo responding groggily; shaking the sleep from his eyes, he notices Kara’s tail and immediately  wakes up. &quot;Guess it’s level 2 for you,” Milo hugging his wife.<br />
“And you as well,” Kara shifting herself; but finding it difficult with approximately two hundred pounds of a muscle appendage that was meant to be in the water.<br />
<br />
Milo looked and notices his own tail has also grown in. His golden bronze scales travel down a tail that was at least twenty feet; ending in a dolphin like fluke. Unlike Kara, Milo didn’t have the frilly membrane Kara had at her waist. Instead, Milo had what looked like small fins on the underside on his tail near his vent.<br />
“I wonder what those are,” Kara touching them.<br />
“Claspers,” Milo responding; “to better grip you as we mate in the ocean.”<br />
“How did you know that,” Kara looking stunned.<br />
<br />
Milo only shrugs as he felt his yellow hair has become shoulder length, thick and full. They cover his ears that have become pointed; ending in the same golden bronze scales like on his tail. His hands fully webbed and the finger ending in sharp looking claws. Unlike Kara who’s hands are speckled with blue scales; Milo’s hands were completely covered in scales.<br />
“Looks like we are both almost done changing,” Milo smiling as he looks for and presses the emergency call button.<br />
<br />
Both kiss each other passionately as attendants eventually arrive to see what the emergency is. When they see that both are sporting tails, the attendants quickly leave before coming back with wheelchairs for both.<br />
“I had a dream of us Milo,” Kara struggling to get into the wheelchair; “we just started a family.”<br />
“A prophetic future,” Milo smiling; as he too struggle to get into the wheelchair; managing to sit in the chair his tail like Kara’s being dragged limply as the attendant’s wheel them backwards to the entrance of level two.<br />
<br />
Like the dining room pool; the entrance to level two was a large pool with a ramp. The attendants wheeling the two new mermaids to the pool, stopping as they wade up to their knees. Both Kara and Milo grin as they push off from their temporary connivance and slowly float in the water. They take a few experimental flaps with their tails as they begin to swim like a fish for the first time in the pool.<br />
“Your final change will be gills,” an attendant speaking up; “when we close the door, the entire room will fill up with water. Be calm and relax,” the attendant leaving; the door to at the bottom of the pool will lead you to level 2.<br />
<br />
Kara and Milo watch as the heavy doors they were lead through are shut and then feel more saltwater fill up the room.<br />
“Let’s test out our tails,” Kara grinning as she effortlessly dives to the bottom of the pool.<br />
Milo grins as he soon dives down as well; surprised at how easily he can keep up with his wife. Finding more and more space to swim around as the room slowly filled up with water; neither noticed that they weren’t struggling to breathe or that their lungs were screaming for air. They just embraced each other and kissed while floating in the water; their tails lazily swaying as they gazed into each other’s eyes.<br />
“Want to try out sex in the water,” Kara grinned; placing one of her webbed hands on Milo’s vent, smiling as his dick started to swell and rise out from its home.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Milo grins as he presses Kara close to her; his rod sliding into her feminine vent with ease; their tails twisting as Milo’s claspers grip Kara as he begins to thrust and gyrate. Their frenzied passion causing the two to spin end over end in the water; Kara cooed with delight as she felt Milo’s seed flow into her.<br />
“Wild,” Kara smiling; her silver hair floating behind her as she slowly uncouples from Milo’s embrace. With another kiss, both bonded mermaid and merman head to the bottom of the pool to the door that will allow them into level 2 of the facility.</p>
