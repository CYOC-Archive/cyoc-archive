<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was panicking. He couldn’t be seen by his mother like this. He quickly grabbed his phone and called his friend Matt. Matt picked up, a little groggy; “Hello?”. “Hey Matt, its Ben. I need to come over and crash at your place for the day. Its an emergency”. Matt seemed confused; “Ben? You sound so different. Your voice is all deep and gruff. Whats wrong?”. “I know, I will explain when I get there; But Matt, don’t freak out, some pretty strange stuff is happening”. “Alright Ben, see you in a bit”.<br />
<br />
Now that Ben had a place to go, he needed to get out of the house without raising suspicion. He looked at his face; other than a couple scattered thick hairs sprouting out of his chin and cheeks, a slightly swollen forehead, and a bit of a unibrow, his face still looked human. He threw on long jeans (where it looked like a tube of meat was being snaked down his left leg) and his tennis shoes, and threw of a hooded sweatshirt, with the hood up. He threw his laptop with the chronivac into his backpack and ran downstairs. As he was exiting the front door, he yelled (in an unconvincing attempt at a high pitched voice) to his mom in the kitchen; “Hey, no time for breakfast, I’m going to go hang out with Matt for the day”. “Okay honey, be safe”, his mom yelled back. Finally out of the house, he proceeded to Matt’s house. It was about a 15 walk, but Ben ran at a brisk jog, even though it was already fairly hot; He didn’t want to be caught in the open as his changes progressed any further.<br />
<br />
When Ben got to Matt’s house, he let himself in and ran up the stairs and into his friend’s room. “Oh hey Ben”, Matt said, pausing his video game and turning around to face him. “What’s wrong? Why was your voice so deep?”. Ben took a breath, not expecting his friend to believe him; “Okay, so there was this new computer program I got and… and… and I didn’t think it would actually work but… I’m transforming into a caveman”… Matt looked confused for a second, and then burst out laughing; “Hahaha, good one man!”. Ben sighed, and lifted up his sweatshirt, showing off his new crop of body hair he had sprouted on his stomach and chest. Matt froze, staring at the incredibly thick body hair his friend now sported, matted down with sweat from the jog. “Its no joke, Matt. Here, I will show you”.<br />
<br />
Ben opened his backpack, pulled out the computer, and loaded up the chronivac. The timer still showed around 32 hours left of the transformation. Ben explained that he could not stop or change anything else about himself until the 32 hours was up, and by that time, he would completely be a hairy, smelly, beastly Neanderthal. “That’s why I came to your place; I needed some where to stay where no one could see me until the transformation was complete and I could change back!”. Matt was still in disbelief; “Sure man, you can crash here until the timer runs out. My parents are gone for the weekend anyways”.<br />
<br />
“Wow, Ben, a Neanderthal? Like, a hairy, club wielding caveman? Wow!”, exclaimed Matt, now a little excited about the chronivac. “Well Ben, take off your shirt and stuff, I want to see what a 1/3rd of a caveman looks like!”. Ben hesitated, but decided to take off at least some of his clothes; his arms were too long and his legs were too short for these clothes anyways.<br />
<br />
Ben started with his shoes; they were tight and his feet felt squashed inside of them. As he took his feel out of the shoes, he noticed that they seemed a lot bigger than normal; at least 2-3 sizes larger than before. Peeling his socks off, Ben saw some other obvious change he had missed before. His feet were incredibly hairy, to the point that they looked like hobbit feet! He had thick brown hair growing all over the tops of his feet, and thick hair on his toes, curling together<br />
 Ben (and Matt, with a slight grimace) noticed that his feet smelled a bit more than usual. Matt was watching Ben undress with amazement; “Wow Ben, if your feet are that hairy, that how hairy is the rest of you? By the end of this, you’ll probably have so much hair you won’t need to wear clothes anymore!”, said Matt jokingly. Ben gave an anxious chuckle, thinking uneasily that what Matt said was probably true.<br />
<br />
Next, Ben takes off his sweatshirt, exposing his whole torso. His sweaty, matted, thick chest and stomach hair fully visible to Matt now. Matt also noticed that Ben had a huge tuft of hair sticking out of his armpits. “Jesus, Ben, you are one hairy son of a bitch now!” Matt said. Matt grabbed Ben’s arm, noticing how thick and wiry the forearm hair now felt, and lifted the arm up. “Hey, at least you finally hit puberty”, he joked while pointing at Ben’s thick bushy underarm hair. “Very funny Matt. Yea I know I’m pretty hairy now; at least I don’t have any back hair yet, just a few thick hairs sprouting on my upper arms and shoulders. Back hair really grosses me out”. “Well Ben, sorry to break it to you, but you still got 66% to go; I wouldn’t hold out any hope”, replied Matt. With the hood of the sweatshirt off, Matt could finally see Ben’s whole face. “Hey Ben, at least your face doesn’t look that changed; the only totally noticeable difference is your huge adam’s apple sticking out now”. “Haha, thanks Matt. Can we just play some video games or something to pass the time? We still have a long way to go”.</p>
