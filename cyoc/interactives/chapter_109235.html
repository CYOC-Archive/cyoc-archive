<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff scrolled through all the menus with growing interest. Which one did he want to choose? He finally settled on &quot;high school wrestler&quot;. He knew that all the wrestlers in his school were very popular, muscular, and always had girlfriends! He clicked it, hesitated a minute, and then went for it. He clicked okay and there was a loud noise and then blackness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff! Wake up your going to miss the bus! If you miss another Saturday practice you are going to be cut from the team!&quot;. Jeff woke with a start. His mom was banging on the door and yelling at him. What happened? He was just at his computer playing with the new chronivac moments ago? He slowly opened his eyes. His body was covered up by his blanket but he saw a huge tent pole sticking up the blanket! He tore his covers off and gasped at himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see all he was wearing were some plaid boxers. However the boxers were obscenely tented by his throbbing erection. Judging by the size of his tented boxers, he had to be at least 9 inches long now! His boxers were pretty wet with some sticky clear substance. Pre cum! Jeff was astounded that he could make pre cum now! He had heard about it in health class but he never made any before. Same with real cum! &quot;I bet I can totally cum with this now!&quot;, he thought.<br />
<br />
The next thing that caught his hair was how big and manly his body looked now! He had brown hair crawling upwards from the waist band of his boxers, and sprouting all along his whole stomach. The hair was much darker and thicker around his belly button. He noticed that he now had a slightly defined 6 pack, but it was hard to see with all the hair around it!<br />
<br />
His eyes were then drawn to his chest. Whoa! He had hair all over his chest! He could see that he had lean but developed pecs. The valley in between his pecs was full of thick curly brown chest hairs! He had more than his dad now! He saw the hair became more sparse on his pecs (but there was still a fair amount of it) before reaching his nipples, where the long brown hairs have sprouted all around.<br />
<br />
He reached out and touched his chest hair in disbelief. &quot;This is crazy!&quot;, Jeff said to himself. He was startled at how deep his voice was now! It was booming and masculine. His hand shot out and touched his throat, where he felt a bulging lump. His Adams apple! As he felt his throat he saw his forearms were huge, muscular and hairy now! Much different than the hairless twigs he had before! There were veins running up his thick forearms, and brown hair sprouted and curled all over his arms. On top of that, his hands were huge now! He even had hair on his knuckles.<br />
<br />
He looked around his room and saw that too was different. There were boxers, jockstraps and wife beaters all over the floor. They looked well worn and dirty. Crinkling his nose he noticed that they smelled dirty too! He saw barbells and weights on his floor as well. He saw a wallet he hadn&#39;t seen before on his night stand. Opening it he saw his license. He was 18 years old now! He also spied some condoms in his wallet too. Why would he need condoms. This was so crazy!</p>
