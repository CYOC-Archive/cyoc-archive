<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Writer&#39;s Note: So long story short, I&#39;ve been taking a advance writing class recently, and one of my assignments was to write a short story. So I figured, &quot;Since the Paladin&#39;s Journey doesn&#39;t have a prologue, then why not write one?&quot; And thus this chapter was born. This is a prologue/stand alone side story that takes place sometime before &quot;The Paladin&#39;s journey begins&quot;. This is essentially a prequel branch made to give a new angle to explore Isaac&#39;s world.  My short story is actually fairly long for CYOC chapter standards, so I&#39;m gonna split it up into smaller chapters to make things more digestible and to give people the opportunity to diverge from any crossroads in the story. Enjoy!<br />

..............................................<br />
<br />
The Royal Tavern was not your typical bar. This particular bar was located inside the royal castle, where all the royal guards, local knights, and the kingdom’s soldiers go to blow off steam. And because this bar was located inside the royal castle, everyone here was a regular who usually lived inside or in the capitol outside the castle. As the Royal Tavern’s bartender, Harald was able to recognize immediately when someone isn&#39;t a regular.  <br />
<br />
Harald currently had his eye on a newbie he never seen before. At first, Harald thought he was just another knight in shining armor coming in to slack off from his shift, but as the man walked towards the local quest board where anyone can post a job, he could make out the man’s much higher quality and exotic armor. Never before, had he seen equipment like that. Yet, he could tell that they were better built and magically enhanced for battle than the typical knight. But more importantly, the man was radiating what no other knight can do, a warm and calming aura of purity blessed by Angela, the deity of purity, which gave off the illusion that the user was practically glowing. This was no knight. This guy was more than that. This man was a paladin.<br />
<br />
But just because he a paladin doesn’t mean he is anything new. There are other paladins in the bar too. No one batted a eye when this newbie entered the bar. But Harald knows from experience that it is a good idea to learn more about the newbies before one of them turns out to be a magical suicide bomber. Again.<br />
<br />
Harald watched carefully as the paladin picked a job off the quest board and then walked toward Harald’s direction. As the paladin sat down in front of Harald, he spared no time passing the piece of paper with the job on it to Harald.<br />
<br />
Harald recognized the job immediately. The piece of paper had a crude drawing of a sentient forest strangling stick figures with it’s vines with a brief written description under it. “Are you seriously telling me you want to tackle this job?”<br />
<br />
The man wordlessly nodded. In response, Harald let out a humorless chuckle.<br />
<br />
“You can’t show me how serious you are just by nodding! You do realize what this is right?” Harald asked as he waved the paper in front of the paladin&#39;s face. “This is a monster kill order! But not just any monster job, but a high level one at that! You do realize people died or got corrupted taking on this one right?!”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
The paladin nodded again. “I’m well aware what this job is sir. It’s why I came to you. You are the one who pinned this job on the quest board, correct? Do you have more information for me?”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald rolled his eyes in exasperation. “Not missing a beat, huh? Alright, it looks like you know what you are doing...”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
He slapped the job poster onto the counter, “Alright! So you know about the Obani forest?” <br />
<br />
The stranger frowned. “I’ve heard of it, but I’ve never been there myself.”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
“Nor would you get the chance too,” Harald explained. “About 6 months ago, the village was completely wiped off the maps by the Obani forest next door. Apparently, the forest just suddenly grew out of control and started mutating in humans within its grasp into plant-like monsters. Even as we speak, the Eclipse Legion and a handful of your fellow paladins are fighting the forest’s border to make sure it doesn’t cover more ground than it already has. Oh, and did I already mention the deaths and struggle? Anyways, the Eclipse Legion has reason to believe that the forest has a monster controlling the forest from within. But no one has managed to get past the forest’s defenses and came back successful. So they sent me this job in case there’s someone out there strong enough to do so.”<br />
<br />
The paladin nodded again as he seemingly absorbed every last word of warning Harald just spout out. “Is there anything else I should know about?”<br />
<br />
Harald face palmed as his attempt to scare this guy failed. “Are you hearing yourself right now?! I just said paladins like you are already struggling to hold the perimeter! How are you any different?!”<br />
<br />
The paladin simply just looked Harald in the eye. “Then you probably don’t recognize me.&quot; The paladin placed his hand on his chest for emphasis. &quot;My name is Isaac Evan Wismon. I am one of the Order’s top paladins who recently left the forces to become a freelancer.”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald examined Isaac with skepticism. “A freelance paladin huh…. Well firstly, even if I have heard of you, I’ve never seen your face. I’ll have no idea if you are an impostor or not.”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Isaac calmly exhaled. “I can assure you that I’m-”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald intervened with a raised hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Secondly...&quot; Harald gestured to the tavern&#39;s other customers. &quot;Look around you. This tavern is full of freelance paladins. Some of them were the strongest of their former legion. You ain&#39;t the first, nor would you be the last.&quot;<br />
<br />
The newbie looked around as if this was the first time he paid the others any thought. &quot;Indeed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold raised a eyebrow. &quot;First time huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is actually my first time in this part of the royal castle...&quot; The top paladin muttered dumbly.<br />
<br />
Is this guy serious? <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you seriously telling me you didn&#39;t expect this many freelancers? I know the Order is strict, but come on! Boy, you must have lived under a rock if you think you are the only special one around these parts.&quot; Harold replied sarcastically. <br />
<br />
The newbie silently nodded in response.<br />
<br />
Harald let out a resigned sigh. “Tell you what. Since you look and act like a experienced fighter, I suppose it’s worth a shot.”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald is too tired to deal with this fool’s death wish.<br />
<br />
The newbie nodded again to show his appreciation, “Thank you sir.”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald nodded back tiredly. “Just call me Harald. Everyone here does.”<br />
<br />
The paladin nodded.  “Thank you Harald. Is that all?”<br />
<br />
Harald shook his head. “Actually, I need to give you something to prove that I sent you.” Harald took a good, long look at the man in front of him. “But may I ask why are you going out of the way to get this job specifically? If it’s about money, there are more safer jobs on the board that’s better paying. Sure, they are more boring, but it’s better to have a life to use that money with, right?”<br />
<br />
Isaac shook his head. “It’s more then that. Sure, I could use the award money to buy better equipment...”<br />
<br />
Harald couldn’t help but interject. “Really? Your current equipment looks designed to be more durable and last longer then the armors they usually sell in town.” <br />
<br />
Isaac raised a finger to hush the bartender. “But...”<br />
<br />
Isaac continued. “I want to end this plague of monsters and their ability to corrupt others to their numbers. Every step towards that goal counts. Doing this job would free a large piece of land from the corruption. Land that this kingdom could use.”&#8232;<br />
<br />
Harold let out a genuine laugh. “Ha! You?! The monsters have been a part of this kingdom’s history for generations! The best we can do is use our magic to cut off this kingdom from the rest of the world to prevent those buggers from corrupting others! Not to mention others have tried and failed to figure out where these monsters came from and how to “end” them. Don’t give me that bullshit!”<br />
<br />
Isaac remained vigilant. “If I can prevent others from losing their lives and identities even by a little, it’s worth looking.”&#8232;Harold let out a sigh. “Did you lose someone?”&#8232;Isaac nodded. “Yes. My parents and my older brother. They are still “alive” but their former selves are dead. And yet, I’ve seen others lose much more then me,” He stated matter-a-factly. <br />
<br />
There was a long pause before Harald let out a sigh of defeat. “Look, you can give me as much tragic baggage as you want, but I’m  still not convinced any of that is what you want.” Harald held out his arms as if he is praising the sky. “But what do I know? Looks like you are set on that flimsy reason of yours.”<br />
<br />
Out of pure exasperation, Harald pulled out a piece of paper from behind the counter and handed it to the paladin. “This is a letter addressed to the Eclipse Legion showing that I sent you. Hand this to the captain, and he and his legion would try to make an opening for you to get into the forest. If you managed to successfully bring back the master’s corpse to the captain, he would then give you a letter addressed to me. Bring that letter, and I’ll give you the award money. Does that sound reasonable to you?”<br />
<br />
The paladin stood up from his seat. “Yes. Very. Is there anything else?”&#8232;	<br />
<br />
Harald tiredly shooed the irritating paladin away. “No. Now don&#39;t get mad at me if you become a plant monster. Oh, and before you go, pin the job posting back on the quest board, would ya? You’re not the only fool interested in this job.”<br />
<br />
The paladin did just that and left without another word.<br />
<br />
Harald meanwhile let out an exasperated sigh...<br />
<br />
And then a bar fight broke out among the patrons. What wonderful timing.</p>
