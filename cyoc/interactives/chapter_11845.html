<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave ran out to the laptop and looked at the spinning replica of his now beachball gutted boyfriend.  This was certainly a powerful program he thought to himself as Nate forced his new body through the bathroom door frame and back on to the couch.  Dave looked him over.  Huge gut, some muscle definition... and a 3 inch erection.  Dave wanted to try this himself.<br />
<br />
  He closed the model causing a prompt to show up.  &quot;Closing the model without saving will cause loss of information.  Make changes permanent until next model edit?  Yes or no?&quot;.  Nate looked kind of hot like this, and they could change the model later... so Dave saved it, making Nates new body his &quot;normal&quot; size.  He handed Nate the camera.  &quot;Here, take some pictures of me, I want to try this.&quot;  He said, standing up from the couch.  He was a decently built man.  173 pounds.. lean, with dark waved hair and startlingly aquamarine eyes.  A bit of stubble made his face dark... and despite his hairless chest, arms, and legs, a small trail of hair led down from his bellybutton to his 5 inch flaccid dick.  Nate positioned the camera to take the necessary shots, and loaded them quickly into the program.  In a few clicks, there he was.<br />
<br />
  &quot;There.&quot; Said Nate, looking from behind the laptop resting on his gargantuan paunch.  &quot;looks just like you... sexy...&quot;  He said as he handed Dave the laptop.  &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;.  Dave looked at the miniature him on the screen.  &quot;Oh, you'll see.&quot;  Dave sat on the couch, making sure that Nate couldn't see the alterations being made on the tiny screen from behind his bulge.  He began to twirl the dials.  The first made all those little hairs on his crotch and lower abs recede... making him entirely hairless... except for on his head.  He smiled as he altered a few more aspects and clicked on the render button.  &quot;There... it should take 10 minutes.&quot;  Dave said to Nate.<br />
<br />
  They sat... speechless for a moment.  Dave's arms behind his head.  Nate pointed at him as the changes began.  &quot;Look, Dave.  Your pit hair is leaving.&quot;  He said, pointing.  Sure enough, the hair was pulling back into Dave... as was his arm and leg hair.  He brought his hand down to his crotch as his pubes pulled back in... leaving him smooth as the day he was born.  Part two occured.  Dave's balls began to swell.  Larger and larger they got, stretching his sac a little, swelling to the size of extra large eggs.  Next, his dick perked.  It twitched once and became 6 inches... then 7.  8 inches... 9... 10... 11, 12 inches... soft!  Nate laughed in a pleased way.  &quot;What now?&quot;  He asked.  &quot;Just wait... you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dave let out a sigh as the change started.  His lean pecs heaved out.  They expanded like balloons, becoming filled with more and more muscle.  They grew larger and larger, pushing his nippled under them, leaving him with a smooth skinned chest, with no features on them.  Next, his abs became taught, defined, rock hard.  They made a constricting noise as they developed further than any man either of them had seen before.  Next, the growth spread into his quads, which pumped up second after second... lifting his egg sized balls as they swelled beneath them.  His calves joined in as his upper legs grew.  Soon, each one of his thighs was the size of his waist.  They didn't stop growing though, and now his shoulders and biceps were growing as well.  His whole body was growing now, and he looked like an amateur bodybuilder.  &quot;Wow... I do like this.  You're growing pretty fast... how big are you going to get?&quot;  Nate said, rubbing his growing boyfriend.  &quot;Well, there's about 5 more minutes left... and it's all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dave stood up, slowly, his whole body growing as he did.  His huge pecs had grown immense, they were sticking out far in front of his face.  His abs had grown increasingly tight and ripped.  His butt had grown considerably as well, forming a nice shelf from his lower back.  Growing lats propped up his swelling arms, and his traps shortened his beefing neck each second.  His body was groaning as it grew.  He was much larger than any bodybuilder Nate had ever seen!  His huge biceps were sitting on his lats, appearing parrallell to the floor.  His quads and aductors had grown so large that his feet were as far apart as his shoulders were wide.  His traps had risen to his jawline, which had become much squarer, and his shoulders looked like basketballs.  He was also having a tough time moving as the last few seconds clicked by.  Dave's body was constricting him to the motion capabilities of a statue. A few last pounds pumped into him, and it was done.  Nate looked over Dave's new body... he was so large... twice as big as any bodybuilder he'd seen before.  A chest that stuck out nearly 4 feet in front of his face... his upper body had to be 10 feet around... each thigh was now twice as big as his waist, and each of his calves were probably as big as it.  His arms were thick and ropey, and his entire body was hairless.  He moved slowly... deliberately toward Nate on the couch.  His huge thighs pushing his slowly hardening dick with each step.  He lowered himself inch after inch... his hugely muscled legs wouldn't bend.  His enormous quads forced him to lay down, which made only a small portion of his body rest on the couch.<br />
<br />
  Nate quickly got up and pushed the coffee table under Daves other side, and still his whole body wasn't supported.  &quot;How big did you make yourself?&quot; Nate said, picking up the laptop.  The screen flashed his stats.  Bodyhair: 0%, Height: 5'10&quot;, Penis length: 12 inches, Testicle size: 4x, Body type: Hypermuscular, Weight: 620 pounds.  &quot;You're 620 pounds!?&quot;  Nate shouted.  &quot;Oh yeah, boy...&quot; Dave said, attempting to grab at his half erect dick... an impossible feat for one with a body such as his.  &quot;I think I want to get even bigger, too...&quot;.  &quot;Bigger, you say?&quot;  Nate asked.  &quot;You got it, big guy.&quot;.  Nate fiddled with the dials and clicked render.  &quot;How does another 300 sound?&quot;.  Nate walked over and sat down on Dave's growing thighs.  &quot;It sounds great.&quot;  Dave smiled.  Nates huge stomach slid gently against Daves now 23 inch hard on.  Nate lowered himself as best he could with his beachball belly, and placed the huge head in his mouth, sucking and twisting as Dave grew... After another 5 minutes, Dave had grown impossibly huge, as well as completely immobile.  Oddly enough, not a bit of vascularity could be seen on him.  It was as though this body was natural now.  His new 920 pound body had outgrown the couch and coffee table, bringing them down with a crunch... he lay on the ground, letting Nate pleasure him.</p>
