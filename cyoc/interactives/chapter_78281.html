<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The werewolf stared long and hard at me, sniffing at the air. She let out another low growl and started to <br />
push by Veronica, who simply placed a hand on her chest. &quot;No..&quot; she told Meagan. Veronica moved over to me and <br />
tenderly nuzzled me and almost theatrically wrapped her arms around me. I wondered how much was getting <br />
through to the girl who was encased in that beastly form, like how much she could actually understand. I <br />
readied myself to make a wish for my own protection if things went poorly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meagan..go into the manager's office,&quot; she gestured to a door marked &quot;private&quot;. &quot;Change back to your human <br />
shape and give us a little privacy. I'll come get you when we're done.&quot; The werewolf nodded and lumbered off, <br />
closing the office door behind her.<br />
<br />
Veronica sat back down on my lap and stared at me. &quot;She was confused because you don't smell like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can fix that,&quot; I said. With one of my free hands, I slid her robe up and readied myself to eat her out, <br />
just like Meagan had.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Veronica said, pushing my hand away and readjusting so the robe hid her gorgeous mound. <br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I..&quot; she said, hesitating as she tried to choose the right words. &quot;I don't want you to be subservient to me. <br />
If you drink my juices or get bitten by me, you will be. I want an equal...a partner..&quot; she leaned her head on <br />
my shoulder, gently pressing herself against me. &quot;A mate..&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
It was a little overwhelming to hear it. I wasn't looking for a commitment or love..honestly, most of my <br />
thoughts for the ring involved having a ton of sex in as many fetishy ways as possible with zero consequence. <br />
But the more I thought about it, she really could be the right one for me. Physically she was my ideal, and <br />
her personality was right up my alley as well. I could do far worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; I said as I tilted her chin up and gave her a long kiss. &quot;I wish..I was a werewolf. I wish I was <br />
not bound by any mystical or supernatural means to be subservient or obedient to you or any other being. I <br />
wish that in my werewolf form, I am your equal in strength, speed, and dominance over any other werewolf, and <br />
that my cock held the same infectious and attractive powers as your vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
The energy slammed through me, whirling and burning with a supernatural electrical feeling. I felt emptied and <br />
then refilled as the magic of the ring redid my very existence on the spot. When I opened my eyes, my senses <br />
were overwhelmed-I could hear the traffic outside, and the giggle of a couple having a joke as they walked by. <br />
And the smells! My brain processed information rapidly from all of the scents around me. I could smell the <br />
sexual avalanche of the puddled musk and cum, each one distinct, somehow letting me know how old or young its <br />
creator was. I could smell remnants of drinks at tables ten feet away, the liquor stinging my nose when I <br />
inhaled more deeply. But most of all, I could smell HER. Veronica smelled even more attractive than she <br />
looked, human and wolf blended perfectly.<br />
<br />
I smiled broadly as I nuzzled the hollow of her neck and kissed her with another lingering press of my lips on <br />
hers. &quot;You..you smell amazing..&quot; I said breathlessly. &quot;You smell like..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like yours,&quot; she said, putting a finger on my lips to hush me as she kissed the tip of my nose. &quot;And you <br />
smell like mine..&quot; She sat up a little more and then leaned her forehead against mine and sighed happily.<br />
We lingered like that for a few minutes, not saying a word, just smiling and touching quietly. Then a smile <br />
cracked her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can come out now, Meagan..&quot; she called. &quot;Poor thing was getting a little impatient,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Meagan came out rather sheepishly, trying to gather the tattered remnants of her clothing enough to hide her <br />
modesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's some spare tshirts and pants in the lockers in the dressing room; I'm sure there's a set that'll fit <br />
you just fine,&quot; she informed her. Veronica nudged me and whispered, &quot;A wish to make sure of that would be nice <br />
though.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and made the wish, and a minute later we heard an excited &quot;Holy shit! You were right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really seem to have a soft spot for her,&quot; I told my mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah..I guess I do,&quot; she agreed. &quot;In high school, I was a lot like her...not rail thin and not <br />
particularly stacked...girls like that have it rough. We don't get the hot boy we have a crush on to take us <br />
to prom..instead, we get to go with a friend. We don't have fifty million people signing our yearbook, and <br />
we're never invited to the big-deal parties, except as a consolation prize, or by one of our friends who's <br />
trying to be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You blossomed rather nicely,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was lucky. My boobs hit right at the end of high school, and my metabolism kicked up about five notches. <br />
Most girls aren't so lucky. Either way, I'm always nice to the girls like her, because I know how shitty the <br />
world can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meagan came out of the back, wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt and blue jeans. She paused when she got near me. <br />
&quot;Wow..NOW I can smell that you're one of ... us?&quot; she said in confusion as she looked at Veronica.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's my mate, which makes him your alpha as well,&quot; she said. It was a mostly good-natured tone, but there was <br />
that hint of command that clearly meant 'submit'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well yeah..OBVIOUSLY,&quot; Meagan said, laughing nervously. She looked at me. &quot;Sorry..kinda new at this,&quot; she <br />
apologized, immediately staring at the floor and fidgeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, Meagan,&quot; Veronica told her. &quot;You're part of OUR pack now. You're family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Meagan replied, her eyes wide. &quot;That's actually how this works?&quot;<br />
<br />
Veronica nodded. &quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meagan joined us at the chair, and she leaned in and nuzzled both of us, awkwardly putting her arms around <br />
both of our shoulders. &quot;Thank you..&quot; she said softly. &quot;Seriously..thank you.&quot; I could smell her mood, as weird <br />
as that sounds and feel from her body language just how happy something this minor made her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do anything for my alphas,&quot; she said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know you will,&quot; Veronica replied, giving her a slight kiss on the lips, then turning Meagan's head to <br />
mine, and I gave her one as well. Nothing too shocking, nothing too wet or intense..but quietly intimate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't we head home?&quot; Veronica said before adding, &quot;Would you like to follow us home, puppy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meagan smiled. &quot;This puppy will follow you to the ends of the earth.&quot; And so we got up to leave and walked out <br />
the door, the three of us arm in arm.</p>
