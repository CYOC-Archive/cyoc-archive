<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You awoke early today.  Rising from your nest, you look around the cavern, seeing other nests dot the floor with your brothers, sisters, and elders still in them.  It was a comfortable level of dark to continue resting, but you knew today was too important to remain in bed.  The human was going to return, which was rare in and of itself, but this is also the first time he has done so since you&#39;ve become of age.<br />
<br />
You leave the nesting grounds, heading into one of the tunnels which would lead closer to the greeting area.  As you crawled through various junctions, you decide to remind yourself more about the human.  It had been so long since he&#39;d last returned, you were naught more than a hatchling.  Avernus, more commonly known as &quot;the human&quot; among your warren, is said to be the only one to know about your tribe&#39;s existence.  He was the one to collect that which kept you and your siblings free from the Madness using methods your elders call &quot;sinister magic.&quot;  While they do not deny his act saved the tribe, the elders have made it very clear he and his peoples&#39; practices are what brought about the Madness in the first place.  They claim that kobold-kind was once numerous, as many other non-human races, but it was humanity that killed Serra&#39;s god, then averted the devastation to themselves alone through magicks similar to what Avernus uses.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve always found it hard to believe that an entire race would do something purely for the sake of being evil, and your elders refuse to speak about it at length.  The human Avernus didn&#39;t seem like a bad man the last time you spoke, and when you asked him about it, he said there was no proof of what caused the necessity of soul magic.  He did agree that many of the more numerous races that lacked the right magic users fell, including most kobold tribes.  But that&#39;s what happens when you separate from other societies in dire times.<br />
<br />
You scrabble out from the tunnel into a much wider space, one which is brightly lit.  There are torches all over the place, causing the room to be almost unbearably bright.  It&#39;s hard to imagine that other races could hold such a bright object next to their faces, but you&#39;ve heard many of them can&#39;t see as well as you without them.  It would be this area that Avernus would be brought to first, since it connects to tunnels more appropriate sized to him.<br />
<br />
On that thought, you begin to reminisce on how different he is than you and your kin.  He is stretched out of proportion, with humongous legs that prevent him from moving quickly in tight situations.  You look back at your red-scaled tail.  Normally taken for granted, it helps immensely with balancing; you can&#39;t imagine how Avernus manages to move over unstable places without one.  His face is also very strange.  Between the hair growing all over it and his far-too-close eyes, the aspect you find the most confusing is his nose.  Is he always smelling his food while he eats?  The elders say that human senses are weak, meaning they can have poorly-made noses because they can&#39;t smell things in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Apart from having access to magic your tribe wishes to not learn, it&#39;s hard to imagine how humans survive in their own caverns.  They lack claws or strong jaws, and their prodigious size would make carving tunnels that much worse.  He said hair constantly grows and falls out, too.  You raise a hand to the top of your own scaled head, feeling the obviously superior horn outcroppings.  They grew in when you reached maturity, but your elders have said they will grow no further for the rest of your life.  As you move away from the horns, you&#39;re greeted by your ear-fins.  Unlike human ears, these large fins aid in hearing even the quietest crack of stone while tunneling.  You did find it odd that your kin that did not share the same scale color as you developed different horns and ear-fins, but you&#39;ve been assured that it is just variance caused through your birth-parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drask?&quot;  A familiar voice speaks out from behind you.  You turn around to see Ozula, the matriarch of the tribe.  She is giving you a slightly worried look.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m waiting for the human, of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
She appears unfazed by your response.  &quot;That&#39;s not what I-&quot;  She quickly collects herself.  &quot;That&#39;s not what he&#39;s here for.  The human is here to do business with us; he is not on one of his &#39;educational&#39; trips this time around.&quot;  She continues to stare at you, as if she expected something.  After a pregnant delay, she speaks again.  &quot;That means he is not going to be speaking with anyone other than myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But nothing.  His business is not one I will allow to creep any further into the minds of our clan.  We still have need of him, but I shall bear the burden of his foul work.&quot;  <br />
<br />
A third well-known voice echoed through the mostly empty room.  &quot;Foul work, eh?&quot;  In a flash, Avernus appeared in the lit room.  He towers over you still, though less moreso than your last memory of him.  He meets eyes with you, and you see a flash of surprise.  &quot;Actually, let us keep this one around.&quot;  He kneels, trying to meet you at eye level.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but your tribe&#39;s names are so hard to remember when I&#39;m away for years.  What is yours, again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ozula speaks up before you do.  &quot;He is Drask, and he will not be attending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that your tribe is unfond of the work I do, but I&#39;ve thought about your circumstances for some time. I believe it is best to reintroduce your tribe to prove that your race is not purely Lost.  Nearby villages have expanded, and your warren might start seeing explorers within the coming years.  I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t need to explain what would happen if they were to find you, Ozula.&quot;  He gave a short pause, continuing before your leader gave a response.  &quot;I have sworn to take the secret of your tribe to the grave, but I will not see my work undone.  Let me introduce one of your tribe to the world, so that it gets people thinking instead of killing all kobolds on sight.  I can take any one of them, but I&#39;d prefer Drask, here.  While I don&#39;t know him in this life, his soul was one of the first I acquired for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re apprehensive about this sort of deal.  On one hand, getting to see the world is an amazing chance, and with a human you&#39;d surely be safer than if you were alone.  On the other, the only stories you&#39;ve heard of the world is one of corruption and dominion by things that hate you for existing, and the only truly safe haven is the warren.  Then again, the elders spin everything to be dreadful and doomed, yet all your own experiences have shown otherwise.  You remain silent, knowing this is not a time for you to speak.<br />
<br />
The chieftain sighs.  &quot;I assume this is your price, this time around?  Partial freedom from your promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
He gives a knowing smile.  &quot;You are the leader for many reasons.  I&#39;ve begun trading my services for actions, rather than coin.  Wealth can only change the world so much, and I&#39;ve ran out of reasons to accept gold.  If Drask returns with me, I&#39;ll collect the souls required for your next generation, nearly free of monetary charge.  The only payment I&#39;d require is to offset the cost of vessels and materials.&quot;  He pauses, keeping his gaze on Ozula.  &quot;I&#39;ve not even asked how many you&#39;ll require this time around, so this can be quite the deal for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tears her vision away from him, returning it to you.  She looks you up and down, then hardens her expression, returning her gaze to Avernus.  &quot;And what if I found another to be stolen by you?&quot;<br />
<br />
His smile faded into a frown.  &quot;I&#39;m not stealing anyone.  As long as I introduce them, they will be free to live as they wish, be it under me or some other patron.  If it is someone other than Drask, then I will have to ask for a small portion of payment for my time taken, since I have to expect you&#39;ll try to send someone I&#39;ll regret bringing back.&quot;  You rotate to look back to your matriarch, who&#39;s already set her gaze back upon you.  Next to you, the human speaks up once more.  &quot;Of course, this offer is as much to Drask as it is to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unblinking, she remains focused on you.  &quot;Yes.  You&#39;ve become of age, have you not, Drask?  Since this is your life at stake and these are...&quot;  Her glowering visage softens.  &quot;...Extreme circumstances, it is best that I do not make this choice for you.  Do you wish to leave with this human, or do you want this to be placed upon one of your siblings?&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Ozula stated this echoed the actual gravity of the situation.  It did not matter if you agreed or not; this was something that was bound to happen.  If it wasn&#39;t going to be you, who would it be?  Would the others know it would be you that sacrificed one of the tribe to avoid this fate?  This was all too sudden; had you time to find out all the ramifications of both choices, maybe you&#39;d feel safe denying this.  Being outside of your element is one of the surest ways to die, but who were you to place someone else in that same position?  No, cowardice can&#39;t be the answer.  &quot;I will go with Avernus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So be it.  There is your prize, human.  You may stop holding my tribe&#39;s future hostage.&quot;  You&#39;re not sure if you answered incorrectly, based on how negative her response was.  &quot;Drask, pack what you wish to bring with you.  The human will be busy for some time to fulfill his end of the deal, so don&#39;t rush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avernus cuts in.  &quot;Actually, take as many things as you wish.  The university has a woefully low amount of knowledge on kobold society and any artifacts from a still-living civilization would be excellent.  Most of what we collect from Lost ones are always thrown into question on whether it&#39;s of the original kobolds or a result of their soulless offspring.&quot;  Ozula gives a half-nod in your direction, continuing toward the ritual room.<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to bring, you go about collecting what was assigned to you.  Your mining pick, dust goggles, and other various implements to ease the potentially dangerous task of extracting materials from the stone were the first to get packed, but after that, you were unsure.  With long-duration travelling in mind, you collect several different packed rations to keep things from getting too stale.  Your kin were starting to awaken and get begin their routine, not questioning why you were out of place.  Returning to the meeting area, you wait outside the ritual room for a fairly long time.  Only two other kobolds passed you during this period; this room is separated from the rest of the tunnel network, making it a waste of time to pass this way.<br />
<br />
The door open, and the two you&#39;ve been waiting for return.  Avernus notices you seated toward one of the adjoining walls, then speaks up.  &quot;You certainly had more of ritual components than I had anticipated.  It&#39;s almost as if you want to deal with me less regularly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I don&#39;t want you around here.  You&#39;re risking my warren with your selfish schemes.&quot;  You rise to your feet to close the gap as they continue their discussion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I find it more selfish to keep something hidden until the last of it dies.  I guarantee Drask shall be safe within the university; academic sorts are a bit more disconnected than those who must deal with the Lost as a living.&quot;  He paused for a moment.  &quot;If anything, they&#39;ll probably want him for some thesis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ozula was clearly ignoring him, instead remaining focused on you.  &quot;I see you&#39;ve collected your equipment.  This is good; they&#39;ll ask fewer questions that way.  Follow closely to the human no matter what.  If he loses you or you lose him along the journey, hide and try to make your way back to the warren if possible, avoiding contact with others as much as possible.  They will try to kill you.&quot;  She jabbed Avernus&#39; knee to get his attention.  &quot;This one has never seen the surface.  Keep a close eye on him at all times and be prepared to explain many things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gave a strange look that you&#39;d never seen a kobold make.  &quot;You can&#39;t mean that, right?  Does he not even know day from night, or the sky?&quot;  He pauses for a response, then interrupts Ozula as her mouth opens.  &quot;Does he at least know Common?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course he doesn&#39;t know any of those things.  None of us know your frail language.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really...That could explain some things.&quot;  He focuses more closely on you.  &quot;I guess the university will be one of the better places for more reasons than one, now.  We&#39;ll figure out what exactly to do with you on the way back.&quot;  Still in denial over the events, you simply nod.<br />
<br />
He opens the large door that you were never allowed to pass, revealing a much taller hallway with more torches sparsely spread along the path.  You follow him into the tunnel, looking back to see the door close on all that you knew.  Turning back, you look up toward the head of the strange, nearly 6-foot-tall creature you&#39;ve been tasked to follow.  &quot;What were those things you were talking about with Ozula?&quot;<br />
<br />
He continues forward, slightly hunching to avoid hitting the ceiling.  &quot;Eesh, I&#39;d rather not think of ways to explain it, so let&#39;s try a different way.  You&#39;re very sheltered, and you&#39;re going to see a lot of things that you probably never fathomed could exist.  Try to take it in stride, as most of it won&#39;t harm you.  Also, everyone we pass by won&#39;t understand a word you say, nor will you understand a word they say.&quot;  What had you gotten yourself into?  &quot;I&#39;ll give some basic stuff about new things as long as you ask about them, but first, I want to see what you&#39;d like to do with your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, what you&#39;d like to become a master at.  I&#39;m taking you to a place that is known for helping people achieve goals like that, be it magic or mundane.  And by magic, I mean every kind-&quot;  he quickly interrupted himself. &quot;-almost every kind! Perhaps you&#39;d rather try exploration, or maybe a type of knowledge is what you&#39;ll find the most interesting to pursue.  I&#39;ve read great things about the magical potential of kobolds, but their laws were so rigid they rarely made any real advancement in the field.  I&#39;d be willing to wager a kobold with the right education could even become a cleric, like me!&quot;<br />
<br />
He stops moving forward to make eye contact.  He clearly expects a decision to be made.</p>
